Engineered FlaB-secreting bacteria effectively suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in mouse models and prolonged survival. By using Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5)-negative  cell lines, we provided evidence that the FlaB-mediated tumor suppression upon bacterial colonization is associated with TLR5-mediated host reactions in the tumor microenvironment. These therapeutic effects were completely abrogated in TLR4 and MyD88 knockout mice, and partly in TLR5 knockout mice, indicating that TLR4 signaling is a requisite for tumor suppression mediated by FlaB-secreting bacteria, whereas TLR5 signaling augmented tumor-suppressive host reactions. Tumor microenvironment colonization by engineered  appeared to induce the infiltration of abundant immune cells such as monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils via TLR4 signaling. Subsequent secretion of FlaB from colonizing  resulted in phenotypic and functional activation of intratumoral macrophages with M1 phenotypes and a reciprocal reduction in -like suppressive activities. Together, these findings provide evidence that nonvirulent tumor-targeting bacteria releasing multiple TLR ligands can be used as  immunotherapeutics.Copyright © 2017, American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26599402>Immune Adjuvant Activity of Pre-Resectional Radiofrequency Ablation Protects against Local and Systemic Recurrence in Aggressive Murine Colorectal .</a></h2><p>While surgical resection is a cornerstone of  treatment, local and distant recurrences continue to adversely affect outcome in a significant proportion of patients. Evidence that an alternative debulking strategy involving radiofrequency ablation (RFA) induces antitumor immunity prompted the current investigation of the efficacy of performing RFA prior to surgical resection (pre-resectional RFA) in a preclinical mouse model.Therapeutic efficacy and systemic immune responses were assessed following pre-resectional RFA treatment of murine CT26  adenocarcinoma.Treatment with pre-resectional RFA significantly delayed tumor growth and improved overall survival compared to sham surgery, RFA, or resection alone. Mice in the pre-resectional RFA group that achieved a complete response demonstrated durable antitumor immunity upon tumor re-challenge. Failure to achieve a therapeutic benefit in immunodeficient mice confirmed that tumor control by pre-resectional RFA depends on an intact adaptive immune response rather than changes in physical parameters that make ablated tumors more amenable to a complete surgical excision. RFA causes a marked increase in intratumoral CD8+ T lymphocyte infiltration, thus substantially enhancing the ratio of CD8+ effector T cells: FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. Importantly, pre-resectional RFA significantly increases the number of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells within the tumor microenvironment and tumor-draining lymph node but had no impact on infiltration by myeloid-derived suppressor cells, M1 macrophages or  macrophages at tumor sites or in peripheral lymphoid organs (i.e., spleen). Finally, pre-resectional RFA of primary tumors delayed growth of distant tumors through a mechanism that depends on systemic CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity.Improved survival and antitumor systemic immunity elicited by pre-resectional RFA support the translational potential of this neoadjuvant treatment for  patients with high-risk of local and systemic recurrence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28905524>First experience in colorectal surgery with a new robotic platform with haptic feedback.</a></h2><p>The use of robotic techniques is increasing in colorectal surgery. Recently, the Senhance surgical robotic system was introduced as a novel robotic platform designed to overcome some of the limits of standard laparoscopy. This study describes the initial, single center experience, evaluating feasibility and safety of the new robotic system in performing colorectal surgical procedures.From June 2015 to November 2016, perioperative data of the first 45 patients who underwent robotic colorectal surgery with the SenhanceTM surgical robotic system were collected and analyzed. Indications for surgery included inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal , endoscopically unresectable adenomas and complicated diverticular disease.The median age was 57 years (18-92) and the median BMI was 24 Kg/ (16-30). Surgical indications were colorectal  (66%), complicated inflammatory bowel disease (18%), diverticular disease (11%) and endoscopically unresectable adenoma (4.4%). The median operative time was 256 minutes; the median docking time 10.7 min (range 2-25). There were 3 conversions to standard laparoscopy, and none to laparotomy. All patients operated on for malignancy (28 adenocarcinoma, 2 neuroendocrine tumors) underwent an appropriate oncological procedure. The median time to discharge was 5 days (range 3-19). The incidence of post-operative complications was 35.5% (Clavien-Dindo I/II-14 patients, III-2 patients). One patient was readmitted in the postoperative period. No patient required reoperation.The results of this audit suggest that adoption of The Senhance surgical robotic system in colorectal surgery is feasible and safe. More clinical data are needed to determine whether this approach can offer any other benefits over other minimally invasive surgical techniques. This article is protected by copyright.

In this study, a series of triazole compounds (M1-M10) were evaluated for some biological activities. In vitro qualifications of these compounds on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and human carbonic anhydrase enzyme activities were performed. Also, their antitumoral activities in human  (HT29) cell line cultures were examined. In addition,  experimentation was induced in rats by an in vivo method, and the in vivo anticancer effects of triazole derivatives were investigated. Also, the effects of these derivatives in levels of antioxidant vitamin A, vitamin E, and MDA were studied in rat liver and blood samples. Most of the compounds were found to exhibit significant antioxidant and antitumoral activities. All the compounds had cytotoxic activities on HT29 cell lines with their IC values lower than 10 µM concentrations. The low IC  values of the compounds are M1 (3.88 µM),  (2.18 µM), M3 (4.2 µM), M4 (2.58 µM), M5 (2.88 µM), M6 (2.37 µM), M7 (3.49 µM), M8 (4.01 µM), M9 (8.90 µM), and M10 (3.12 µM).© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30271205>Low tumor purity is associated with poor prognosis, heavy mutation burden, and intense immune phenotype in .</a></h2><p>Tumor purity is defined as the proportion of  cells in the tumor tissue. The impact of tumor purity on  (CC) prognosis, genetic profile, and microenvironment has not been thoroughly accessed.Clinical and transcriptomic data from three public datasets, GSE17536/17537, GSE39582, and TCGA, were retrospectively collected (n=1,248). Tumor purity of each sample was inferred by a computational method based on transcriptomic data. Survival-related analyses were performed on microarray dataset containing GSE17536/17537 and GSE39582 (n=794), whereas TCGA dataset was utilized for subsequent genomic analysis (n=454).Right-sided CC patients showed a significantly lower tumor purity. Low purity CC conferred worse survival, and tumor purity was identified as an independent prognostic factor. Moreover, high tumor purity CC patients benefited more from adjuvant chemotherapy. Subsequent genomic analysis found that the mutation burden was negatively associated with tumor purity, with only  and  significantly more mutated in high purity CC. However, no somatic copy number alteration event was correlated with tumor purity. Furthermore, immune-related pathways and immunotherapy-associated markers (programmed cell death protein 1 [PD-1], programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1], cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA-4], Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 [LAG-3] and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 [TIM-3]) were highly enriched in low purity samples. Notably, the relative proportion of  macrophages and neutrophils, which indicated worse survival in CC, was negatively associated with tumor purity.Tumor purity exhibited potential value for CC prognostic stratification as well as adjuvant chemotherapy benefit prediction. The relative worse survival in low purity CC may attribute to higher mutation frequency in key pathways and purity-related microenvironmental changing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29072417>Prediction of Response to Irinotecan and Drug Toxicity Based on Pharmacogenomics Test: A Prospective Case Study in Advanced Colorectal </a></h2><p>FOLFIRI regimen, which is composed of 5-FU, Leucovorin, and Irinotecan, is used in the first-line chemotherapy of metastatic colorectal . Irinotecan life threatening toxicity is partly related to cytotoxic drug metabolite which is primarily inactivated by the UGT1A1 enzyme. The primary aim of the present research was to find the correlation between UGT1A1-genotype and clinical toxicity of irinotecan.In a prospective study from March 2011 to December 2013, all patients with metastatic colorectal  who had been referred to Medical Oncology Department of Iran  Institute were genotyped for UGT1A1*28 before the first cycle of chemotherapy. All of the patients signed informed consent and trial approved by Ethics Committee of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Reduction of the standard dose of Irinotecan (180 mg/ body surface area) was measured based on NCI toxicity criteria after the first cycle of chemotherapy. Patients with previous treatment with Oxaliplatin and fluorouracil (5-FU) in the adjuvant setting and adequate liver, kidney, and heart function were included in the trial. Both synchronous and metachronous metastatic disease were noticeable.A total of 50 patients with median age of 52 years were included. Most (70%) of the patients had more than one site of metastases in peritoneum, liver, and/or lung. Thirty-one patients had UGT1A1*1 normal genotype, 13 were in heterozygote and 6 were in homozygote state ofUGT1A1*28/*28. A clinically relevant increase in early toxicity was found in patients carrying the UGT1A1*28/*28 genotype with odds Ratio (OR) of 2.6 (95%CI 2.5-27.28). Similarly, there was a trend of lower overall survival in homozygote group with an HR (Hazardous Ratio) of 2.76 (95%CI .88-.61). No statistically significant relationship was found between UGT1A1genotypes and response to therapy.UGT1A1 28*/28* is strongly associated with drug’s life-threatening toxicity even in a moderate dose of Irinotecan. On the other hand, UGT1A1 genotype data was not helpful to differentiate response to treatment.Creative Commons Attribution License</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27934790>Abdomino-endoscopic perineal excision of the rectum for benign and malignant pathology: Technique considerations for true transperineal verus transanal total mesorectal excision endoscopic proctectomy.</a></h2><p>Transanal minimally invasive surgery using single port instrumentation is now well described for the performance of total mesorectal excision with restorative colorectal/anal anastomosis most-often in conjunction with transabdominal multiport assistance. While non-restorative abdomino-endoscopic perineal excision of the anorectum is conceptually similar, it has been less detailed in the literature.Consecutive patients undergoing non-restorative ano-proctectomy including a transperineal endoscopic component were analysed. All cases commenced laparoscopically with initial medial to lateral mobilisation of any left  and upper rectum. The lower anorectal dissection started via an intersphincteric or extrasphincteric incision for benign and malignant pathology, respectively, and following suture closure and circumferential mobilisation of the anorectum, a single port (GelPOINT Path, Applied Medical) was positioned allowing the procedure progress endoscopically in all quadrants up to the cephalad dissection level. Standard laparoscopic instrumentation was used. Specimens were removed perineally.Of the 13 patients (median age 55 years, median BMI 28.75 kg/, median follow-up 17 months, 6 males), ten needed completion proctectomy for ulcerative colitis following prior total colectomy (three with concomitant parastomal hernia repair) while three required abdominoperineal resection for locally advanced rectal  following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Median operative time was 190 min, median post-operative discharge day was 7. Eleven specimens were of high quality. Four patients developed perineal wound complications (one chronic sinus, two abscesses needing drainage) within median 17-month follow-up.Convergence of transabdominal and transanal technology and technique allows accuracy in combination operative performance. Nuanced appreciation of transperineal operative access should allow specified standardisation and innovation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25434400>Dynamic changes and functions of macrophages and M1/ subpopulations during ulcerative colitis-associated carcinogenesis in an AOM/DSS mouse model.</a></h2><p>The high risk of developing colorectal carcinoma (CRC), from ulcerative colitis (UC), is well known. Macrophages are widely distributed immune cells that have an indispensable role in UC, as well as in CRC. However, little is currently known about the dynamic changes that occur in macrophage and M1/ macrophage subpopulations, during UC‑associated carcinogenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the alteration of colorectal macrophages and M1/ macrophage subpopulations during UC‑associated carcinogenesis. Both expression level alterations and functional changes were determined during UC‑associated carcinogenesis in an azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate‑induced chemically colitis‑associated carcinoma mouse model of Crj:CD‑1 (ICR) mice. Notable evidence from immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, cytokine detection, and gene expression analyses demonstrated that  macrophages have a critical role in CRC initiation, promotion, and metastasis.  macrophages are associated with unbalanced pro‑inflammatory and anti‑inflammatory axes and aberrant enhancement of migration/invasion‑associated factors. Functional changes, similar to  polarized macrophages, were shown to occur in the M1 macrophages, without phenotypical changes, during the development of carcinoma and metastasis. The results of the present study suggest that  macrophages have a pro‑tumor role during UC‑associated carcinogenesis. Furthermore, similar functional changes occurred in the M1 macrophages, without polarization alterations, during carcinogenesis and metastasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25418473>Response gene to complement 32 (RGC-32) expression on -polarized and tumor-associated macrophages is M-CSF-dependent and enhanced by tumor-derived IL-4.</a></h2><p>Response gene to complement 32 (RGC-32) is a cell cycle regulator involved in the proliferation, differentiation and migration of cells and has also been implicated in angiogenesis. Here we show that RGC-32 expression in macrophages is induced by IL-4 and reduced by LPS, indicating a link between RGC-32 expression and  polarization. We demonstrated that the increased expression of RGC-32 is characteristic of alternatively activated macrophages, in which this protein suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and promotes the production of the anti-inflammatory mediator TGF-β. Consistent with in vitro data, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) express high levels of RGC-32, and this expression is induced by tumor-derived ascitic fluid in an M-CSF- and/or IL-4-dependent manner. Collectively, these results establish RGC-32 as a marker for  macrophage polarization and indicate that this protein is a potential target for  immunotherapy, targeting tumor-associated macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30971761>Upregulated claudin-1 expression promotes colitis-associated  by promoting β-catenin phosphorylation and activation in Notch/p-AKT-dependent manner.</a></h2><p>In IBD patients, integration between a hyper-activated immune system and epithelial cell plasticity underlies  development. However, molecular regulation of such a circuity remains undefined. Claudin-1 (Cld-1), a tight-junction integral protein deregulation alters  epithelial cell (CEC) differentiation, and promotes colitis severity while impairing colitis-associated injury/repair. Tumorigenesis is a product of an unregulated wound-healing process and therefore we postulated that upregulated Cld-1 levels render IBD patients susceptible to the colitis-associated  (CAC). Villin Cld-1 mice are used to carryout overexpressed studies in mice. The role of deregulated Cld-1 expression in CAC and the underlying mechanism was determined using a well-constructed study scheme and mouse models of DSS colitis/recovery and CAC. Using an inclusive investigative scheme, we here report that upregulated Cld-1 expression promotes susceptibility to the CAC and its malignancy. Increased mucosal inflammation and defective epithelial homeostasis accompanied the increased CAC in Villin-Cld-1-Tg mice. We further found significantly increased levels of protumorigenic  macrophages and β-cateninSer552 (β-CatSer552) expression in the CAC in Cld-1Tg vs. WT mice. Mechanistic studies identified the role of PI3K/Akt signaling in Cld-1-dependent activation of the β-CatSer552, which, in turn, was dependent on proinflammatory signals. Our studies identify a critical role of Cld-1 in promoting susceptibility to CAC. Importantly, these effects of deregulated Cld-1 were not associated with altered tight junction integrity, but on its noncanonical role in regulating Notch/PI3K/Wnt/ β-CatSer552 signaling. Overall, outcome from our current studies identifies Cld-1 as potential prognostic biomarker for IBD severity and CAC, and a novel therapeutic target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26838097>Colorectal -derived microvesicles modulate differentiation of human monocytes to macrophages.</a></h2><p>Tumour-derived microvesicles (TMVs) are important players in tumour progression, modulating biological activity of immune cells e.g. lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages. This phenomenon is particularly interesting in the progression of , as macrophages in this type of tumour are relevant for the recovery processes. In the present study, the role of  cell-derived microvesicles in monocyte differentiation and activity profile (polarization) was investigated.Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) were differentiated in vitro in the presence of TMVs obtained from : Caco-2, SW620, LoVo or SW480 cell lines and analysed according to their morphology and biological functions, as defined by cytokine secretion, reactive oxygen intermediate (ROI) production and cytotoxic activity against respective  cells.Monocytes differentiated with TMVs exhibited morphological and phenotypical characteristics of macrophages. An early contact (beginning with the first day of the in vitro culture) of monocytes with TMVs resulted in increased IL-10 secretion and only slightly elevated TNF release. Early, or prolonged contact resulted in low ROI production and low cytotoxicity against tumour cells. On the other hand, late contact of MDM with TMVs, stimulated MDM to significant TNF and IL-12 secretion, ROI production and enhanced cytotoxicity against tumour cells in vitro. In addition, differences in MDM response to TMVs from different cell lines were observed (according to cytokine secretion, ROI production and cytotoxicity against tumour cells in vitro). Biological activity, STATs phosphorylation and microRNA profiling of MDMs indicated differences in their polarization/activation status which may suggest mixed polarization type M1/ with the predominance of proinflammatory cells after late contact with TMVs.Macrophage activity (polarization status) may be regulated by contact with not only tumour cells but also with TMVs. Their final polarization status depends on the contact time, and probably on the vesicle "cargo", as signified by the distinct impact of TMVs which enabled the switching of MDM maturation to regulatory macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27721235>Tumor-associated macrophages drive spheroid formation during early transcoelomic metastasis of ovarian .</a></h2><p>Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can influence ovarian  growth, migration, and metastasis, but the detailed mechanisms underlying ovarian  metastasis remain unclear. Here, we have shown a strong correlation between TAM-associated spheroids and the clinical pathology of ovarian . Further, we have determined that TAMs promote spheroid formation and tumor growth at early stages of transcoelomic metastasis in an established mouse model for epithelial ovarian .  macrophage-like TAMs were localized in the center of spheroids and secreted EGF, which upregulated αMβ2 integrin on TAMs and ICAM-1 on tumor cells to promote association between tumor cells and TAM. Moreover, EGF secreted by TAMs activated EGFR on tumor cells, which in turn upregulated VEGF/VEGFR signaling in surrounding tumor cells to support tumor cell proliferation and migration. Pharmacological blockade of EGFR or antibody neutralization of ICAM-1 in TAMs blunted spheroid formation and ovarian  progression in mouse models. These findings suggest that EGF secreted from TAMs plays a critical role in promoting early transcoelomic metastasis of ovarian . As transcoelomic metastasis is also associated with many other cancers, such as pancreatic and  cancers, our findings uncover a mechanism for TAM-mediated spheroid formation and provide a potential target for the treatment of ovarian  and other transcoelomic metastatic cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29886671>[Sole angioplasty with tiny balloon for high-risk complex symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis].</a></h2><p> To explore the safety and short-term efficacy of sole angioplasty with tiny balloon for symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) patients with complex lesions refractory.

Patients' demographics, lesions characteristics, procedures, complications, and clinical and imaging follow-up data were collected. There were 6 male and 5 female patients with mean age of 63.6 years (range: 45 to 77 years). Clinical manifestations were transient ischemia attack (TIA) in 4 cases, progressive ischemic stroke in 3 cases, recurrent stroke in 3 cases, and 1 case for preparation of scheduled radical resection of . ICAS locations were middle cerebral artery M1 segment in 5 cases,  segment in 1 case, anterior cerebral artery A1 segment in 2 cases, and intracranial vertebral artery in 3 cases. Mean degree of ICAS stenosis was 92%. Lesion morphology was type A in 3 cases, B in 4 cases and C in 4 cases by Mori classification. Forward flow by modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) was grade 1 to 2a in 8 cases, 2b in 3 cases. Collateral compensation grading was grade 2 in 5 cases, grade 3 in 6 cases.  Technique success rate was 10/11, peri-procedural complication rate was 1/11. Post-procedural forward flow in all cases had been enhanced and 10 cases obtained mTICI 2b to 3.

Increased cell glycolytic rates even in the presence of oxygen is fully recognized as a hallmark in  and known as the Warburg effect.In the late 1970's, Linus Pauling and Ewan Cameron reported that vitamin C may have positive effects in  treatment, although deep mechanistic knowledge about this activity is still scarce.We describe a novel antitumoral mechanism of vitamin C in KRAS mutant colorectal  that involves the Warburg metabolic disruption through downregulation of key metabolic checkpoints in KRAS mutant  cells and tumors without killing human immortalized colonocytes.Vitamin C induces RAS detachment from the cell membrane inhibiting ERK 1/2 and PKM2 phosphorylation. As a consequence of this activity, strong downregulation of the glucose transporter (GLUT-1) and pyruvate kinase  (PKM2)-PTB dependent protein expression are observed causing a major blockage of the Warburg effect and therefore energetic stress.We propose a combination of conventional chemotherapy with metabolic strategies, including vitamin C and/or other molecules targeting pivotal key players involved in the Warburg effect which may constitute a new horizon in anti- therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29551360>Complement 5a stimulates macrophage polarization and contributes to tumor metastases of .</a></h2><p>Inflammatory cells such as macrophages can play a pro-tumorigenic role in the tumor stroma. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) generally display an  phenotype with tumor-promoting activity; however, the mechanisms regulating the TAM phenotype remain unclear. Complement 5a (C5a) is a cytokine-like polypeptide that is generated during complement system activation and is known to promote tumor growth. Herein, we investigated the role of C5a on macrophage polarization in  metastasis in mice. We found that deficiency of the C5a receptor (C5aR) severely impairs the metastatic ability of implanted  cells. C5aR was expressed on TAMs, which exhibited an -like functional profile in  liver metastatic lesions. Furthermore, C5a mediated macrophage polarization and this process relied substantially on activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. Finally, analysis of human  carcinoma indicated that C5aR expression is negatively associated with tumor differentiation grade. Our results demonstrate that C5aR has a central role in regulating the  phenotype of TAMs, which in turn, contributes to hepatic metastasis of  through NF-κB signaling. C5a is a potential novel marker for  prognosis and drugs targeting complement system activation, specifically the C5aR pathway, may offer new therapeutic opportunities for  management.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

These patients also have compromised antioxidant defenses as the result of nutritional deficiencies. The micronutrient selenium is essential for selenoprotein production and is transported from the liver to target tissues via selenoprotein P (SEPP1). Target tissues also produce SEPP1, which is thought to possess an endogenous antioxidant function. Here, we have shown that mice with Sepp1 haploinsufficiency or mutations that disrupt either the selenium transport or the enzymatic domain of SEPP1 exhibit increased colitis-associated carcinogenesis as the result of increased genomic instability and promotion of a protumorigenic microenvironment. Reduced SEPP1 function markedly increased -polarized macrophages, indicating a role for SEPP1 in macrophage polarization and immune function. Furthermore, compared with partial loss, complete loss of SEPP1 substantially reduced tumor burden, in part due to increased apoptosis. Using intestinal organoid cultures, we found that, compared with those from WT animals, Sepp1-null cultures display increased stem cell characteristics that are coupled with increased ROS production, DNA damage, proliferation, decreased cell survival, and modulation of WNT signaling in response to H2O2-mediated oxidative stress. Together, these data demonstrate that SEPP1 influences inflammatory tumorigenesis by affecting genomic stability, the inflammatory microenvironment, and epithelial stem cell functions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26799669>Macrophage targeting contributes to the inhibitory effects of embelin on colitis-associated .</a></h2><p>Macrophages are a major component of inflammatory and tumor microenvironment. We previously reported that embelin suppresses colitis-associated tumorigenesis. Here, the role of macrophage targeting in the anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor properties of embelin was investigated. By using colitis-associated  (CAC) model, we demonstrated that embelin significantly depleted  macrophages by blocking their recruitment. Moreover, embelin attenuated -like polarization of macrophages within the tumor microenvironment and eliminated their tumor-promoting functions during the development of CAC. Embelin potently inhibited NF-κB signaling in macrophages and decreased the production of key pro-inflammatory cytokines and tumorigenic factors involved in CAC, such as TNFα, IL-6 and COX-2. In addition, embelin directly reduced the polarization of  macrophages in vitro even in the presence of Th2 cytokines. These results suggested that targeting macrophages is, at least in part, responsible for the anti-tumor activity of embelin in CAC. Our observations strengthen the rationale for future validation of embelin in the prevention and treatment of CAC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30837080>A comprehensive review and update on ulcerative colitis.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel disorder of the  that causes continuous mucosal inflammation extending from the rectum to the more proximal , with variable extents. UC is characterized by a relapsing and remitting course. UC was first described by Samuel Wilks in 1859 and it is more common than Crohn's disease worldwide. The overall incidence and prevalence of UC is reported to be 1.2-20.3 and 7.6-245 cases per 100,000 persons/year respectively. UC has a bimodal age distribution with an incidence peak in the 2nd or 3rd decades and followed by second peak between 50 and 80 years of age. The key risk factors for UC include genetics, environmental factors, autoimmunity and gut microbiota. The classic presentation of UC include bloody diarrhea with or without mucus, rectal urgency, tenesmus, and variable degrees of abdominal pain that is often relieved by defecation. UC is diagnosed based on the combination of clinical presentation, endoscopic findings, histology, and the absence of alternative diagnoses. In addition to confirming the diagnosis of UC, it is also important to define the extent and severity of inflammation, which aids in the selection of appropriate treatment and for predicting the patient's prognosis. Ileocolonoscopy with biopsy is the only way to make a definitive diagnosis of UC. A pathognomonic finding of UC is the presence of continuous  inflammation characterized by erythema, loss of normal vascular pattern, granularity, erosions, friability, bleeding, and ulcerations, with distinct demarcation between inflamed and non-inflamed bowel. Histopathology is the definitive tool in diagnosing UC, assessing the disease severity and identifying intraepithelial neoplasia (dysplasia) or . The classical histological changes in UC include decreased crypt density, crypt architectural distortion, irregular mucosal surface and heavy diffuse transmucosal inflammation, in the absence of genuine granulomas. Abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scanning is the preferred initial radiographic imaging study in UC patients with acute abdominal symptoms. The hallmark CT finding of UC is mural thickening with a mean wall thickness of 8 mm, as opposed to a 2-3 mm mean wall thickness of the normal . The Mayo scoring system is a commonly used index to assess disease severity and monitor patients during therapy. The goals of treatment in UC are three fold-improve quality of life, achieve steroid free remission and minimize the risk of . The choice of treatment depends on disease extent, severity and the course of the disease. For proctitis, topical 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) drugs are used as the first line agents. UC patients with more extensive or severe disease should be treated with a combination of oral and topical 5-ASA drugs +/- corticosteroids to induce remission. Patients with severe UC need to be hospitalized for treatment. The options in these patients include intravenous steroids and if refractory, calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) or tumor necrosis factor-α antibodies (infliximab) are utilized. Once remission is induced, patients are then continued on appropriate medications to maintain remission. Indications for emergency surgery include refractory toxic megacolon,  perforation, or severe colorectal bleeding.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, the genes in SPFs altered by  stimulation may include some biologically important factors associated with patient prognosis. In this study, we aimed to identify new biomarkers using genes specifically upregulated in SPFs by -cell-conditioned medium (CCCM) stimulation (SPFs CCCM response genes; SCR genes) in  (CC). We constructed two frameworks using SCR gene data: a publicly released microarray dataset, and validation cases with freshly frozen CC samples to identify genes related to short recurrence-free survival (RFS). In the first framework, we selected differentially expressed genes between the high and low SCR gene expression groups. In the second framework, genes significantly related to short RFS were selected by univariate analysis using all SCR genes, and multivariate analysis was performed to select robust genes associated with short RFS. We identified CTGF, CALD1, INHBA and TAGLN in the first framework, and PDLIM5, MAGI1, SPTBN1 and TAGLN in the second framework. Among these seven genes, high expression of three genes (CALD1, TAGLN and SPTBN1) showed a poor prognosis in our validation cases. In a public microarray dataset, SCR gene expression was associated with the expression of ECM component, EMT, and -macrophage associated genes, which was concordant with the pathological features of CMPI. Thus, we successfully identified new prognostic factors.© 2015 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27842006>Primary anastomosis in emergency surgery of left .</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancers are second leading cause of death in Western countries.

These cells, if genetically modified, can be used as vehicles to deliver toxic material to, or express anticancer proteins in tumor. To test this hypothesis, we developed several single, endothelial-specific, and doxycycline-inducible self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vectors. Two distinct expression cassettes were inserted into a SIN-vector: one controlled by an endothelial lineage-specific, murine vascular endothelial cadherin (mVEcad) promoter for the expression of a transactivator, rtTA2S-; and the other driven by an inducible promoter, TREalb, for a firefly luciferase reporter gene. We compared the expression levels of luciferase in different vector constructs, containing either the same or opposite orientation with respect to the vector sequence. The results showed that the vector with these two expression cassettes placed in opposite directions was optimal, characterized by a robust induction of the transgene expression (17.7- to 73-fold) in the presence of doxycycline in several endothelial cell lines, but without leakiness when uninduced. In conclusion, an endothelial lineage-specific single inducible SIN lentiviral vector has been developed. Such a lentiviral vector can be used to endow endothelial progenitor cells with anti-tumor properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26439504>Clinical Implication of Serine Metabolism-Associated Enzymes in .</a></h2><p>Recently, enzymes of the serine synthetic pathway (SSP) have been suggested as key player in the metabolic adaptation of oncogenesis. We assessed the expression of enzymes of the SSP in  tumor tissue (TT) and paired normal tissue (pNT) and the prognostic implications.From 2006 to 2010, we included 486 patients with  who underwent curative surgery at Kyungpook National University Hospital. Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 1, PDK2, pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), and phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT) expression were investigated by immunohistochemical staining (IHC) in TT and pNT. The IHC values were calculated by multiplying intensity by proportion. The final score was classified as follows: 0-2 as negative and 3-12 as positive.During the median follow-up duration of 55.5 months (37.4-90.6), 78 patients experienced recurrence. The expression of PHGDH, PDK1, and PSAT was significantly higher in TT than pNT (p < 0.001 for each). The univariate analysis for relapse-free survival revealed that TT PDK2 positivity was the only positive prognostic factor (p = 0.023). However, the expression of TT PDK2 did not represent a prognostic value in multivariate analysis.In conclusion, PHGDH, PDK1, and PSAT were significantly increased in  TT compared with pNT. The prognostic implication of these enzymes needs to be further investigated.© 2015 S.

Preclinical models have demonstrated encouraging signs of anti-tumor activity through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.This is a phase 1, dose-escalation trial of NEO-102 (Ensituximab) for patients with refractory pancreatic and colorectal . The primary objective was to determine safety and tolerability of escalating doses of NEO-102. Secondary objectives were to assess pharmacokinetics, anti-tumor activity and biologic correlates. Patients whose tumors express NPC-1 antigen were eligible. Dose-escalation was performed in a 3 + 3 design at doses of 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 mg/kg.A total of 19 patients (4 pancreatic and 15 ) were enrolled at participating institutions in the treatment phase. Most common treatment-related adverse events included anemia, fatigue, fevers, chills and flushing. There was no detectable hemolysis. Of twelve patients evaluable for disease response, the response rate at week 8 included 5 patients with stable disease and 8 patients with progressive disease (PD). Treatment-related grade 3/4 hyperbilirubinemia and anemia were observed at 4 mg/. Reversible hypoxia at 3 mg/kg was a dose-limiting toxicity. The maximum tolerated dose was established at 3 mg/kg. Of 74 patients who underwent tissue screening, positive NPC-1 expression was 47 % in  and 59 % in pancreatic .Treatment with the NEO-102, in this first-in-human study, is well tolerated with a manageable safety profile.

H pylori infection affects more than 50% of the world's population. H pylori eradication therapy is generally safe. To our knowledge, no case of newly diagnosed ulcerative colitis occurring immediately after H pylori eradication therapy has previously been reported.A 63-year-old man received a diagnosis of chronic gastritis and H pylori infection. In early March 2014, primary H pylori eradication therapy was initiated; lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin were administered for 1 week. Beginning on the fourth day, he had watery diarrhea twice a day. From the 11th day, bloody stools and watery diarrhea increased to 6 times a day. Colonoscopy, performed on the 40th day after termination of drug therapy, revealed diffuse inflammation in the distal aspect of the , with histologic findings consistent with ulcerative colitis. He was admitted to the hospital and was provided with a semivegetarian diet and metronidazole. He noticed a gradual decrease in the amount of blood in his feces then a disappearance of the blood. A fecal occult blood test on the 11th hospital day recorded 337 ng/mL. Fecal occult blood test is not indicated during macroscopic bloody stool but is indicated after disappearance of bloody stool.

We evaluated PDT with M-chlorin for in vitro cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction in  cells compared with chlorin alone and glucose-conjugated chlorin (G-chlorin). The subcellular localization of M-chlorin was observed by confocal microscopy, and the M-chlorin PDT effects against TAMs including THP-1-induced -polarized macrophages were evaluated. Anticancer effects were also investigated in an allograft model where cytotoxic effects against TAMs in the  cell stroma were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. M-chlorin PDT strongly induced cell death in  cells to almost the same extent as G-chlorin PDT by inducing apoptosis. M-chlorin was incorporated into  cells where it localized mainly in lysosomes and endoplasmic reticula. M-chlorin PDT revealed strong cytotoxicity for  macrophages induced from THP-1 cell lines, and it induced stronger cytotoxicity than G-chlorin PDT in the allograft model through killing both  cells and TAMs in the  stroma. The M-chlorin PDT produced strong cytotoxicity against  tissue by inducing apoptosis of both  cells and TAMs in the  stroma.

Simultaneously, the mechanical environment actively changes. However, how these dynamic alterations affect the macrophage phenotype is unknown. Here, we observed that the extracellular matrix (ECM) constructed by AKAP12+  mesenchymal cells (CMCs) generated  macrophages by regulating their shape during recovery. Notably, rounded macrophages were present in the linear and loose ECM of inflamed colons and polarized to the M1 phenotype. In contrast, ramified macrophages emerged in the contracted ECM of recovering colons and mainly expressed  macrophage markers. These contracted structures were not observed in the inflamed colons of AKAP12 knockout (KO) mice. Consequently, the proportion of  macrophages in inflamed colons was lower in AKAP12 KO mice than in WT mice. In addition, clinical symptoms and histological damage were more severe in AKAP12 KO mice than in WT mice. In experimentally remodeled collagen gels, WT CMCs drove the formation of a more compacted structure than AKAP12 KO CMCs, which promoted the polarization of macrophages toward an  phenotype. These results demonstrated that tissue contraction during recovery provides macrophages with the physical cues that drive  polarization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29304229>CD16+ Macrophages Mediate Fibrosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Fibrosis is a common complication of Crohn's disease [CD], and is related to dysregulated tissular repair following inflammation, in which macrophages play a central role. We have previously observed that STAT6-/- mice present delayed mucosal recovery after 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid [TNBS]-induced colitis due to a deficiency in reparatory interleukin-4 [IL4]/STAT6-dependent  macrophages, which can be reverted by the exogenous transfer of this cell type. In the present study, we analyse the role of STAT6-dependent macrophages in intestinal fibrosis.Colitis was induced by weekly intra-rectal administration of TNBS [6 weeks] to STAT6-/- mice and wild-type [WT] animals.  surgical resections were obtained from CD patients and from  patients.Chronic colitis provoked a fibrogenic response in STAT6-/- mice, but not in WT animals. An accumulation of  macrophages, defined as CD206+ cells, was observed in WT mice, but not in STAT6-/- animals. Instead, the latter group showed an increase in CD16+ macrophages that correlated with the expression of fibrogenic markers. CD16+ macrophages were also increased in the damaged mucosa of Crohn's disease patients with stenotic or penetrating complications. Finally, administration of IL4-treated WT macrophages to STAT6-/- mice reduced TNBS-induced fibrosis.Our study demonstrates that STAT6 deficiency dysregulates the macrophage response to inflammatory outbursts by increasing the presence of a population of CD16+ macrophages that seems to contribute to intestinal fibrosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27221908>Radiological Downstaging with Neoadjuvant Therapy in Unresectable Gall Bladder  Cases.</a></h2><p>Gall bladder  (GBC) usually presents as unresectable or metastatic disease. We conducted a feasibility study to evaluate the effect of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) on radiologic downstaging and resectability in unresectable GBC cases.Patients with locally advanced disease were treated with chemoradiotherapy [CTRT] ( external radiotherapy (45Gy) along with weekly concurrent cisplatin 35mg/  and 5-FU 500 mg) and those with positive paraaortic nodes were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy [NACT (cisplatin 25mg/ and gemcitabine 1gm/ day 1 and 8, 3 weekly for 3 cycles). Radiological assessment was according to RECIST criteria by evaluating downstaging of liver involvement and lymphadenopathy into complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD).A total of 40 patients were evaluated from January 2012 to December 2014 (CTRT=25, NACT=15). Pretreatment CT scans revealed involvement of hilum (19), liver infiltration (38), duodenum involvement (n=22),  involvement (n=11), N1 involvement (n=11), N2 disease (n=8), paraaortic LN (n=15), and no lymphadenopathy (n=6). After neoadjuvant therapy, liver involvement showed CR in 11(30%), PR in 4 (10.5%), SD in 15 (39.4%) and lymph node involvement showed CR in 17 (50%), PR in 6 (17.6%), SD in 4 (11.7 %). Six patients (CTRT=2, NACT=4) with 66.6 % and 83% downstaging of liver and lymphnodes respectively underwent extended cholecystectomy. There was 16.6 % and 83.3% rates of histopathological CR of liver and lymph nodes. All resections were R0.Neoadjuvant therapy in unresectable gall bladder  results in a 15% resectability rate. This approach has a strong potential in achieving R0 and node negative disease. Radiologic downstaging (CR+PR) of liver involvement is 40.5% and lymphadenopathy is 67.5%.

However, to date, few studies have demonstrated the mechanism of the preventive effect of 4-HPR. In our current study, we revealed that 4-HPR could significantly suppress IL-4/IL-13 induced -like polarization of macrophages, which was demonstrated by the reduced expression of  surface markers, the down-regulation of  marker genes, and the inhibition of -like macrophages promoted angiogenesis. Mechanistically, our study suggested that the inhibition of the phosphorylation of STAT6, rather than the generation of oxidative stress, is involved in the 4-HPR-driven inhibition of  polarization. More intriguingly, by utilizing adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) transgenic mice, we demonstrated that the tumorigenesis was dramatically decreased by 4-HPR treatment accompanied with fewer -like macrophages in the tumor tissues, thereby profoundly blocking tumor angiogenesis. These findings, for the first time, reveal the involvement of  polarization inhibition in 4-HPR-mediated chemoprevention, which provides a new point of insight and indicates the potential mechanism underlying the chemopreventive effect of 4-HPR.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Overexpression of the ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit  (RRM2) has been associated with aggressive  behavior and chemoresistance. Nano-diamino-tetrac (NDAT) is a nanoparticulate derivative of tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac), which exerts anticancer properties via several mechanisms and downregulates RRM2 gene expression in  cells. Resveratrol is a stilbenoid phytoalexin which binds to a specific site on the cell surface integrin αvβ3 to trigger  cell death via nuclear translocation of COX-2. Here we report that resveratrol paradoxically activates RRM2 gene expression and protein translation in  cells. This unanticipated effect inhibits resveratrol-induced COX-2 nuclear accumulation. RRM2 downregulation, whether achieved by RNA interference or treatment with NDAT, enhanced resveratrol-induced COX-2 gene expression and nuclear uptake which is essential to integrin αvβ3-mediated-resveratrol-induced antiproliferation in  cells. Elsewhere, NDAT downregulated resveratrol-induced RRM2 expression in vivo but potentiated the anticancer effect of the stilbene. These findings suggest that RRM2 appears as a  cell defense mechanism which can hinder the anticancer effect of the stilbene via the integrin αvβ3 axis. Furthermore, the antagonistic effect of RRM2 against resveratrol is counteracted by the administration of NDAT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29872624>Biomimetic albumin-modified gold nanorods for photothermo-chemotherapy and macrophage polarization modulation.</a></h2><p>Nanotechnology-based photothermal therapy has attracted great attention in the past decade.

However, the 6-month completion rate of S-1 treatment was 76.5% in the ACTS-CC. Therefore, treatment completion remains an unresolved problem.A randomized phase II trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral daily administration and alternate-day administration of S-1 as adjuvant chemotherapy in curatively resected stage III CRC. Enrolled patients were assigned to either S-1 daily administration (Arm A) or alternate-day S-1 administration (Arm B). Assigned treatment will start within 8 weeks after surgery.

In this study, F-PLP/pIL12, an FRα-targeted lipoplex loading plasmid interleukin-12 (pIL12) was prepared and its physicochemical properties were characterized. Then the antitumor effect of F-PLP/pIL12 was studied in an in vivo model of CT-26 . F-PLP/pIL12 was associated with about 56.6% tumor growth inhibition compared with the saline control. The production of malignant ascites was significantly less pronounced than in controls, and there were fewer tumor nodules and less overall tumor mass (P < 0.01). There was more IL12 expression and IFN-γ secretion in F-PLP/pIL12-treated tumor tissues, but there was less FRα expression. The antitumor mechanisms involved inducing tumor cell apoptosis, reducing microvessel density, and stimulating TNF-α secretion. In addition, there were fewer  macrophages in the tumor microenvironment of tissues stimulated with F-PLP/pIL12, which also activated the natural killer cells. H&E staining of vital organs suggested that F-PLP/pIL12 is safe for use in intraperitoneally administered  therapy.

It is well known that many tumors recruit monocytes from circulation and influence their differentiation, mainly into suppressive -like subsets. Since there are contradictory data concerning the importance of macrophages for  progression, we used in our experiments four  cell lines representing different stages of tumor development (HT29, LS180, SW948, SW620). An acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 was used as a human model of monocytes. Our work revealed that conditioned medium from the tumor cell lines induced activation and differentiation of THP-1 cells. The changes involved increased expression of CD68, a macrophage differentiation marker. Moreover, we also observed increased expression of CD206 and CD163, which are widely considered as markers of tumor-associated macrophages. The tumor-derived conditioned medium decreased the proliferation of THP-1 cells and blocked their cell cycle at the G1 stage. The tumor-conditioned medium also upregulated the production of several cytokines and chemokines characteristic of both M1 and  subsets and induced the expression of important pro-angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in THP-1 cells. Moreover, the tumor-conditioned medium induced the expression of galectin-3, which is implicated in malignant transformation, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, that is, a key enzyme of the kynurenine pathway. Our data suggest that tumor cells can actively influence the phenotype of monocytes and switch their differentiation into a population of non-adherent mixed M1 and  cells. These preliminary studies suggest that  cells produce soluble factors that influence monocyte differentiation, most probably into suppressive subsets. These data provide a better understanding of the influence of  on polarization of monocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664994>Obesity, diabetes and the risk of colorectal adenoma and .</a></h2><p>Colorectal  (CRC) is the fourth most commonly diagnosed gastrointestinal (GI) malignancy and the third leading cause of -related death worldwide. In the current case-control study, an association between diagnosis of CRC, obesity and diabetes was investigated.Demographic characteristics, colonoscopy reports, history of drug, smoking, and medical history were collected from patients referred to a colonoscopy unit. The location, size and number of the polyps were recorded during the colonoscopy. Statistically, t-test was conducted for mean comparison for the groups.

In the present study, 115 and 515 patients were evaluated for adenoma/adenocarcinoma and normal colonoscopy, respectively. The mean age of patients positive for adenoma or adenocarcinoma were significantly higher than the negative groups (p value < 0.001).

Herein, we investigated the  chemopreventive effects of NBT and its  metabolites in a colitis-associated  carcinogenesis mouse model as well as in human  cell models.In azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium treated mice, oral administration of NBT effectively decreased both incidence and multiplicity of  tumors. NBT showed significant antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory effects in the mouse . HPLC analysis revealed that oral administration of NBT resulted in high levels of metabolites, i.e. 3'-demethylnobiletin (M1), 4'-demethylnobiletin (), and 3',4'-didemethylnobiletin (M3) in the  mucosa. In contrast, the  level of NBT was about 20-fold lower than the total  level of three metabolites. Cell culture studies demonstrated that the  metabolites of NBT significantly inhibited the growth of human  cells, caused cell-cycle arrest, induced apoptosis, and profoundly modulated signaling proteins related with cell proliferation and cell death. All of these effects were much stronger than those produced by NBT alone.Our results demonstrated that oral administration of NBT significantly inhibited colitis-associated  carcinogenesis in mice, and this chemopreventive effect was strongly associated with its  metabolites.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, KRS is highly expressed in , and localizes to distinct cellular compartments upon phosphorylations (i.e., the plasma membranes after T52 phosphorylation and the nucleus after S207 phosphorylation), leading to probably alternative noncanonical functions. It is unknown how other subcellular KRSs crosstalk with environmental cues during  progression. Here, we demonstrate that the KRS-dependent metastatic behavior of  spheroids within 3D gels requires communication between cellular molecules and extracellular soluble factors and neighboring cells. Membranous KRS and nuclear KRS were found to participate in invasive cell dissemination of  spheroids in 3D gels.  spheroids secreted GAS6 via a KRS-dependent mechanism and caused the  polarization of macrophages, which activated the neighboring cells via secretion of FGF2/GROα/M-CSF to promote  dissemination under environmental remodeling via fibroblast-mediated laminin production. Analyses of tissues from clinical  patients and Krs-/+ animal models for  metastasis supported the roles of KRS, GAS6, and  macrophages in KRS-dependent positive feedback between tumors and environmental factors. Altogether, KRS in  cells remodels the microenvironment to promote metastasis, which can thus be therapeutically targeted at these bidirectional KRS-dependent communications of  spheroids with environmental cues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29715103>Bidirectional Regulation of COX-2 Expression Between  Cells and Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Our aim was to investigate the crosstalk between tumor and immune cells ( macrophages) and its effects on cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX2) regulation in canine mammary tumors (CMT).Sh1b CMT cells and human BT474 mammary or HT29  cells were co-cultured with canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or with macrophage-like differentiated THP1 monocytes (dTHP1). Intracellular COX2 expression by PBMCs, dTHP1 and  cells was evaluated by flow cytometry.Co-culturing of Sh1b and canine PBMCs induced COX2 overexpression in CMT cells. In turn, COX2 expression by PBMCs, mostly CD68 macrophages, was attenuated by co-culture with Sh1b (p=0.0001). In accordance, co-culture with dTHP1 prompted intracellular production of COX2 in both Sh1b CMT cells and HT29 human  cells and reduced production of COX2 in BT474 human mammary  cells. The intracellular COX2 expression from dTHP1 decreased when treated with conditioned medium from cultured Sh1b and HT29  cells.Bidirectional COX2 regulation between  and monocytes/macrophages might shape a tolerogenic tumor microenvironment in CMT.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Collectively, the virus was detected not only in the tumor but also in some regional lymph nodes and in non-neoplastic mucosa of the upper tract of large bowel. By contrast, it was not identifiable in its common sites of entry, namely oral and ano-genital region. We also found HPV DNA in the plasma-derived exosome. Next, by  studies, we confirmed the capability of HPV DNA-positive exosomes, isolated from the supernatant of a HPV DNA positive cell line (CaSki), to transfer its DNA to human  and normal cell lines. In the stroma nearby the tumor mass we were able to demonstrate the presence of virus DNA in the stromal compartment, supporting its potential to be transferred from epithelial cells to the stromal ones. Thus, this case report favors the notion that human papillomavirus DNA can be vehiculated by exosomes in the blood of neoplastic patients and that it can be transferred, at least , to normal and neoplastic cells. Furthermore, we showed the presence of viral DNA and RNA in pluripotent stem cells of non-tumor tissue, suggesting that after viral integration (as demonstrated by p16 and RNA  hybridization positivity), stem cells might have been activated into  stem cells inducing neoplastic transformation of normal tissue through the inactivation of p53, p21, and Rb. It is conceivable that the virus has elicited its oncogenic effect in this specific site and not elsewhere, despite its wide anatomical distribution in the patient, for a local condition of immune suppression, as demonstrated by the increase of T-regulatory (CD4/CD25/FOXP3 positive) and T-exhausted (CD8/PD-1positive) lymphocytes and the  polarization (high CD163/CD68 ratio) of macrophages in the neoplastic microenvironment. It is noteworthy that our findings depicted a static picture of a long-lasting dynamic process that might evolve in the development of tumors in other anatomical sites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31412307>Dual CTLA-4 and PD-L1 Blockade Inhibits Tumor Growth and Liver Metastasis in a Highly Aggressive Orthotopic Mouse Model of .</a></h2><p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown clinical benefit in several  entities including metastatic microsatellite instable colorectal carcinomas. However, for the majority of metastatic colorectal carcinomas the potential and limitations of immune checkpoint inhibition is not fully understood. In this study, the effects of sole and dual CTLA-4 and PD-L1 blockade were investigated in a microsatellite stable highly aggressive orthotopic mouse model of . Dual CTLA-4 and PD-L1 inhibition resulted in tumor growth stagnation and completely blocked liver metastasis. Sole CTLA-4 and PD-L1 inhibition only moderately reduced metastatic spread of the  cells, though CTLA-4 blockade being superior to PD-L1 inhibition. Dual immune checkpoint blockade and sole CTLA-4 inhibition significantly increased intratumoral CD8+ and CD4+ T cells and reduced FOXP3+/CD4+ Treg cells. This was associated with increased expression levels of the pro-inflammatory Th1/M1-related cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1α, IL-2, and IL-12. Moreover, tumors treated with combined immune checkpoint blockade showed the strongest increase in intratumoral iNOS+ macrophages, reduction of PD-L1+ and Tie2+ macrophages and the lowest expression of /Th2-related IL-4, TARC and COX-2. The assessment of further microenvironmental changes by DCE-MRI and immunohistology revealed no alterations in functional tumor vascularization upon combined immune checkpoint blockade, but a significant increase in intratumoral fibroblasts and collagen I deposition. Thus, the synergistic inhibitory effects of dual immune checkpoint inhibition can be explained by anti-tumorigenic T cell responses mediated by CTLA-4 inhibition and M1 macrophage polarization predominantly induced by PD-L1 blockade. This was accompanied by pronounced fibroblast activation highlighting the interconnection between immunogenicity and desmoplasia.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the role of macrophage ODC in  epithelial-driven inflammation is unknown. Here, we investigate cell-specific effects of ODC in colitis and colitis-associated carcinogenesis (CAC). Human  macrophages expressed increased ODC levels in active ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, colitis-associated dysplasia, and CAC. Mice lacking  in myeloid cells ( mice) that were treated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) exhibited improved survival, body weight, and  length and reduced histologic injury versus control mice. In contrast, GI epithelial-specific  knockout had no effect on clinical parameters. Despite reduced histologic damage, colitis tissues of  mice had increased levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and enhanced expression of M1, but not  markers. In the azoxymethane-DSS model of CAC,  mice had reduced tumor number, burden, and high-grade dysplasia. Tumors from  mice had increased M1, but not  macrophages. Increased levels of histone 3, lysine 9 acetylation, a marker of open chromatin, were manifest in tumor macrophages of  mice, consistent with our findings that macrophage ODC affects histone modifications that upregulate M1 gene transcription during GI infections. These findings support the concept that macrophage ODC augments epithelial injury-associated colitis and CAC by impairing the M1 responses that stimulate epithelial repair, antimicrobial defense, and antitumoral immunity. They also suggest that macrophage ODC is an important target for  chemoprevention. Ornithine decarboxylase contributes to the pathogenesis of colitis and associated carcinogenesis by impairing M1 macrophage responses needed for antitumoral immunity; targeting ODC in macrophages may represent a new strategy for chemoprevention. .©2018 American Association for  Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29666270>MK2 contributes to tumor progression by promoting  macrophage polarization and tumor angiogenesis.</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation is a major risk factor for colorectal .

Blockade of this pathway has been previously reported to suppress inflammation and to prevent colorectal tumorigenesis in a mouse model of inflammation-driven colorectal , by mechanisms that are still unclear. Here, using whole-animal and tissue-specific MK2 KO mice, we show that MK2 activity in the myeloid compartment promotes tumor progression by supporting tumor neoangiogenesis in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that MK2 promotes polarization of tumor-associated macrophages into protumorigenic, proangiogenic -like macrophages. We further confirmed our results in human cell lines, where MK2 chemical inhibition in macrophages impairs  polarization and  macrophage-induced angiogenesis.

B7x has limited expression on normal tissues, but is up-regulated on solid human tumors to inhibit anti-tumor immunity and associates with poor clinical prognosis. We assessed the contribution of cytokine stimuli to induce surface B7x expression on  cells and the role of tumor-expressed B7x in a murine pulmonary metastasis model, and finally evaluated the potential interaction between B7x and Neuropilin-1, a suggested potential cognate receptor. We showed that pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-10 did not induce expression of B7x on human or murine  cells. Following i.v. injection of CT26, a murine  cell line in the BALB/c background, we observed a significant increase in tumor burden in the lung of B7x-expressing CT26 mice compared to B7x-negative parental CT26 control mice. This was marked by a significant increase in  tumor associated macrophages and antigen-specific CD8 T cell exhaustion.

Triptolide exerts a unique bioactive spectrum of anticancer activities. The aim of this study was to determine whether triptolide has any effect on the activation of TAMs and the production of tumor-promoting mediators. ICR-1 mice with azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS)-induced  tumors and BALB/c mice co-inoculated with 4T1 cells and -polarized RAW264.7 cells were used to examine whether the inhibitory effect of triptolide on tumor progression was mediated by the targeting of TAMs. Real-time PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence staining, and flow cytometry assays were performed to determine the expression of cell surface markers and cytokine production. The results showed that triptolide inhibited macrophage differentiation toward the  phenotype and abolished  macrophage-mediated tumor progression. Furthermore, triptolide inhibited the expression of  markers, such as CD206, Arginase 1, and CD204, and inhibited the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Thus our study indicated that triptolide selectively inhibited the functions of -polarized macrophages and TAMs, and this inhibitory effect of triptolide on TAM viability, differentiation, and cytokine production might elucidate the major mechanisms underlying its antitumor activity.

Here, we show that MDM2 is recruited to chromatin independently of p53 to regulate a transcriptional program implicated in amino acid metabolism and redox homeostasis. Identification of MDM2 target genes at the whole-genome level highlights an important role for ATF3/4 transcription factors in tethering MDM2 to chromatin. MDM2 recruitment to chromatin is a tightly regulated process that occurs during oxidative stress and serine/glycine deprivation and is modulated by the pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) metabolic enzyme. Depletion of endogenous MDM2 in p53-deficient cells impairs serine/glycine metabolism, the NAD(+)/NADH ratio, and glutathione (GSH) recycling, impacting their redox state and tumorigenic potential.

Previously, we reported that increased CK2 activity could induce epithelial mesenchymal transition of  cells. CK2 also induced epithelial mesenchymal transition in  cell lines such as HT29 and SW620, and the transitioned cells (CK2α cells) became more proliferative than the controls. We assumed that CK2 could affect  cell growth by modulating their energy metabolism. Here, we examined the molecular effects of CK2 on the glucose metabolism of  cells. We found that CK2α cells consumed more glucose and produced more lactate than control cells did. An XF glycolysis stress test showed that aerobic glycolysis was augmented up to the  cell's maximal glycolytic capacity in CK2α cells. Molecular analysis revealed that pyruvate kinase M1 was downregulated and pyruvate kinase  was nuclear localized in CK2α cells. Consequently, the expression and activity of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) were upregulated. Treatment with FX11-a specific LDHA inhibitor-or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated knockout of LDHA inhibited the CK2-driven proliferation of  cells.

Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) contributes to both of these effects. However, the specific mechanism by which PKM2 promotes uncontrolled proliferation or cell survival under stress in different nutritional environments is unclear. We show that succinylation mediated mitochondrial translocation of PKM2 under glucose starvation plays a role in switching the cellular machinery from proliferation to cell survival mode and vice versa. Mitochondrial PKM2 inhibits ubiquitination-mediated degradation of voltage-dependent anion channel 3 (VDAC3) and increases mitochondrial permeability to generate more ATP for cell survival under nutritional depletion. We found there is a positive correlation of upregulation of mitochondrial PKM2 and upregulation of VDAC3 in human . This shows the mechanisms identified in this study in fact play a role in neoplastic biology. We therefore developed a small molecule designated compound 8 that blocks mitochondrial translocation of PKM2 and inhibits tumor development.

In our previous study, FFCT exerted its antitumor activity not only by inducing apoptosis but also by activating autophagy to eliminate tumor cells. However, its mechanism is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between macrophages activation and FFCT-induced autophagy. Results showed that FFCT could induce autophagy in , as demonstrated by increased level of intracellular autophagy marker LC3 II in CT26.WT cells by fluorescence microscope and western blot assay. FFCT also facilitated numbers of vesicular bodies with bilayer membrane in CT26.WT cells, which were indicative of autophagosomes formation. Autophagosomes secreted by FFCT-treated CT26.WT cells can activate M1 type macrophages, accompanied with increased expression of costimulatory molecules CD86 and CD40 on the surface of RAW264.7 cells, and more inflammatory cytokines secretion, such as TNF-, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-1. mRNA expressions of  macrophages markers, such as IL-10, CD206, Arg-1, and FIZZ-1, were downregulated.

Here, we report that phosphorylation of SMAD3 was detected in a higher percentage in primary mammary tumor tissues from double-transgenic MMTV-Hoxb7/Her2 mice than tumors from single-transgenic Her2/neu mice, suggesting activation of TGFβ/SMAD3 signaling by HOXB7 in breast tumor tissues. As predicted, TGFβ2 was high in four MMTV-Hoxb7/Her2 transgenic mouse tumor cell lines and two breast  cell lines transfected with HOXB7, whereas TGFβ2 was low in HOXB7-depleted cells. HOXB7 directly bound to and activated the TGFβ2 promoter in luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Increased migration and invasion as a result of HOXB7 overexpression in breast  cells were reversed by knockdown of TGFβ2 or pharmacologic inhibition of TGFβ signaling. Furthermore, knockdown of TGFβ2 in HOXB7-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 breast  cells dramatically inhibited metastasis to the lung. Interestingly, HOXB7 overexpression also induced tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment and acquisition of an  tumor-promoting phenotype. TGFβ2 mediated HOXB7-induced activation of macrophages, suggesting that TAMs may contribute to HOXB7-promoted tumor metastasis. Providing clinical relevance to these findings, by real-time PCR analysis, there was a strong correlation between HOXB7 and TGFβ2 expression in primary breast carcinomas. Taken together, our results suggest that HOXB7 promotes tumor progression in a cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous manner through activation of the TGFβ signaling pathway.©2014 American Association for  Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27757304>Tim-3 promotes tumor-promoting  macrophage polarization by binding to STAT1 and suppressing the STAT1-miR-155 signaling axis.</a></h2><p>T cell Ig mucin-3 (Tim-3), an immune checkpoint inhibitor, shows therapeutic potential. However, the molecular mechanism by which Tim-3 regulates immune responses remains to be determined. In particular, very little is known about how Tim-3 works in innate immune cells. Here, we demonstrated that Tim-3 is involved in the development of tumor-promoting  macrophages in . Manipulation of the Tim-3 pathway significantly affected the polarization status of intestinal macrophages and the progression of . The Tim-3 signaling pathway in macrophages was explored using microarray, co-immunoprecipitation, gene mutation, and high-content analysis. For the first time, we demonstrated that Tim-3 polarizes macrophages by directly binding to STAT1 via residue Y256 and Y263 in its intracellular tail and inhibiting the STAT1-miR-155-SOCS1 signaling axis. We also identified a new signaling adaptor of Tim-3 in macrophages, and, by modulating the Tim-3 pathway, demonstrated the feasibility of altering macrophage polarization as a potential tool for treating this kind of disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31044438>NOD-like receptor C4 Inflammasome Regulates the Growth of  Liver Metastasis in NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) enhances the growth and recurrence of colorectal  (CRC) liver metastasis. With the rising prevalence of NAFLD, a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying NAFLD-associated liver metastasis is crucial. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) constitute a large portion of the tumor microenvironment that promotes tumor growth. NOD-like receptor C4 (NLRC4), a component of an inflammasome complex, plays a role in macrophage activation and interleukin (IL)-1β processing. We aimed to investigate whether NLRC4-mediated TAM polarization contributes to metastatic liver tumor growth in NAFLD. Wild-type and NLRC4 mice were fed low-fat or high-fat diet for 6 weeks followed by splenic injection of mouse CRC MC38 cells. The tumors were analyzed 2 weeks after CRC cell injection. High-fat diet-induced NAFLD significantly increased the number and size of CRC liver metastasis. TAMs and CD206-expressing  macrophages accumulated markedly in tumors in the presence of NAFLD. NAFLD up-regulated the expression of IL-1β, NLRC4, and  markers in tumors. In NAFLD, but not normal livers, deletion of NLRC4 decreased liver tumor growth accompanied by decreased  TAMs and IL-1β expression in tumors. Wild-type mice showed increased vascularity and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in tumors with NAFLD, but these were reduced in NLRC4 mice. When IL-1 signaling was blocked by recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, liver tumor formation and -type macrophages were reduced, suggesting that IL-1 signaling contributes to  polarization and tumor growth in NAFLD. Finally, we found that TAMs, but not liver macrophages, produced more IL-1β and VEGF following palmitate challenge. Conclusion: In NAFLD, NLRC4 contributes to  polarization, IL-1β, and VEGF production in TAMs, which promote metastatic liver tumor growth.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30104241>Paclitaxel Reduces Tumor Growth by Reprogramming Tumor-Associated Macrophages to an M1 Profile in a TLR4-Dependent Manner.</a></h2><p>Paclitaxel is an antineoplastic agent widely used to treat several solid tumor types. The primary mechanism of action of paclitaxel is based on microtubule stabilization inducing cell-cycle arrest. Here, we use several tumor models to show that paclitaxel not only induces tumor cell-cycle arrest, but also promotes antitumor immunity. , paclitaxel reprogrammed -polarized macrophages to the M1-like phenotype in a TLR4-dependent manner, similarly to LPS. Paclitaxel also modulated the tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) profile in mouse models of breast and melanoma tumors; gene expression analysis showed that paclitaxel altered the -like signature of TAMs toward an M1-like profile. In mice selectively lacking TLR4 on myeloid cells, for example, macrophages (LysM-Cre/TLR4), the antitumor effect of paclitaxel was attenuated. Gene expression analysis of tumor samples from patients with ovarian  before and after treatment with paclitaxel detected an enrichment of genes linked to the M1 macrophage activation profile (IFNγ-stimulated macrophages). These findings indicate that paclitaxel skews TAMs toward an immunocompetent profile via TLR4, which might contribute to the antitumor effect of paclitaxel and provide a rationale for new combination regimens comprising paclitaxel and immunotherapies as an anticancer treatment. This study provides new evidence that the antitumor effect of paclitaxel occurs in part via reactivation of the immune response against , guiding tumor-associated macrophages toward the M1-like antitumor phenotype. http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/20/5891/F1.large.jpg  .©2018 American Association for  Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25732087>Secreted pyruvate kinase  facilitates cell migration via PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin pathway in  cells.</a></h2><p>Pyruvate Kinase  (PKM2) is a key glycolytic enzyme, which highly expressed in tumor cells, and plays a pivotal role in the growth, survival and metabolism reprogramming of  cells.

It plays an important role in determining the progression and metastasis of a tumour. The characteristic of TAM is largely dependent on the stimuli present in its tumour microenvironment (TME). Under this environment, however,  macrophages are found to be in abundance compared to M1 macrophages which later promote tumour progression. Numerous studies have elucidated the relationship between TAM and the progression of tumour; hence, TAM has now been the subject of interest among researchers for anticancer therapy. This review discusses the role of TAM in colorectal  (CRC) and some of the potential candidates that could reeducate TAM to fight against CRC.

The doses of radiotherapy ranged from 45 to 54.6 Gy. The CEA levels were measured before surgery. We analyzed the actuarial rates of overall survival (OS), distant metastasis (DM), and local recurrence (LR) using Kaplan-Meier curves. Multivariate analyses were performed with Cox regression models. We used THP-1 monocyte cell lines for macrophage differentiation (M0, M1 or ). The RNA extracted from the macrophages was analyzed via a genomic method in the core laboratory. The radiosensitivities of CEA-rich LS1034 cells were compared between cells with and without the conditioned media from CEA-stimulated macrophages.Preoperative CEA levels ≥10 ng/mL were independent predictive factors for OS (p = 0.005), DM (p = 0.026), and LR (p = 0.004). The OS rates among the patients with pretreatment CEA levels < 10 ng/mL and ≥10 ng/mL were 64.5% and 35.9% (p = 0.004), respectively. The corresponding rates of DM were 40.6% and 73.1% (p = 0.024). The corresponding rates of LR were 6.6% and 33.9% (p = 0.002). In the M0 macrophages, exogenous CEA elicited a dose-response relationship with  differentiation. In the CEA-stimulated M0 cells, some mRNAs were upregulated by as much as 5-fold, including MMP12, GDF15, and JAG1. In the CEA-stimulated  cells, a 4-fold up-regulation of GADD45G mRNA was noted. The conditioned media from the CEA-stimulated  cells elicited an increase in the numbers of LS180, SW620, and LS1034 cells after irradiation.

To date, how the tumor microenvironment affects the phenotypes of macrophages is not yet fully understood. In this study, we constructed a NIH3T3/Src cell line stably overexpresses the Src protein and found that conditioned medium from this cell line was able to induce polarization towards the  phenotype in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and Ana-1 macrophages. Further investigation revealed that IL-6 produced by NIH3T3/Src cells plays a key role in  polarization. During the development of colorectal  in C57BL/6J-Apc mice, increased IL-6 secretion in the interstitial fluid of the colorectal tissues was observed. Furthermore, tumorigenesis in IL-6 mice treated with AOM-DSS, an IL-6 knockout mouse strain, was significantly inhibited compared with the control group, suggesting the important role of IL-6 in promoting tumorigenicity.

These include Warburg- and reverse Warburg phenotypes depending on differential distribution of the lactate carrier proteins monocarboxylate transporter-4 and -1 (MCT4 and MCT1). Here, we elucidated the role of the antioxidant transcription factor nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) as the key regulator of cellular adaptation to inflammatory/environmental stress in shaping the metabolism toward a reverse Warburg phenotype in malignant and premalignant  epithelial cells. Immunohistochemistry of human CRC tissues revealed reciprocal expression of MCT1 and MCT4 in carcinoma and stroma cells, respectively, accompanied by strong epithelial Nrf2 activation. In colorectal tissue from inflammatory bowel disease patients, MCT1 and Nrf2 were coexpressed as well, relating to CD68+inflammatory infiltrates. Indirect coculture of human NCM460 colonocytes with M1- but not  macrophages induces MCT1 as well as G6PD, LDHB and TALDO expression, whereas MCT4 expression was decreased. Nrf2 knockdown or reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging blocked these coculture effects in NCM460 cells. Likewise, Nrf2 knockdown inhibited similar effects of tBHQ-mediated Nrf2 activation on NCM460 and HCT15 CRC cells. M1 coculture or Nrf2 activation/overexpression greatly altered the lactate uptake but not glucose uptake and mitochondrial activities in these cells, reflecting the reverse Warburg phenotype. Depending on MCT1-mediated lactate uptake, Nrf2 conferred protection from TRAIL-induced apoptosis in NCM460 and HCT15 cells. Moreover, metabolism-dependent clonal growth of HCT15 cells was induced by Nrf2-dependent activation of MCT1-driven lactate exchange. These findings indicate that Nrf2 has an impact on the metabolism already in premalignant  epithelial cells exposed to inflammatory M1 macrophages, an effect accompanied by growth and survival alterations. Favoring the reverse Warburg effect, these Nrf2-dependent alterations add to malignant transformation of the  epithelium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26902014>Simultaneous Laparoscopic Resection of Primary Tumor and Liver Metastases for Colorectal : Surgical Technique and Short-Term Outcome.</a></h2><p>Laparoscopic approaches are increasingly used in selected patients with either colorectal or liver disease.

We have reported that both SLC7A2 expression and L-Arg availability are decreased in  tissues from inflammatory bowel disease patients and that mice lacking Slc7a2 exhibit a more severe disease course when exposed to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Here, we present evidence that SLC7A2 plays a role in modulating  tumorigenesis in the azoxymethane (AOM)-DSS model of colitis-associated carcinogenesis (CAC). SLC7A2 was localized predominantly to  epithelial cells in WT mice. Utilizing the AOM-DSS model, Slc7a2 mice had significantly increased tumor number, burden, and risk of high-grade dysplasia vs. WT mice. Tumors from Slc7a2 mice exhibited significantly increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines IL-1β, CXCL1, CXCL5, IL-3, CXCL2, CCL3, and CCL4, but decreased levels of IL-4, CXCL9, and CXCL10 compared to tumors from WT mice. This was accompanied by a shift toward pro-tumorigenic  macrophage activation in Slc7a2-deficient mice, as marked by increased  CD11bF4/80ARG1 cells with no alteration in CD11bF4/80NOS2 cells by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. The shift toward  macrophage activation was confirmed in bone marrow-derived macrophages from Slc7a2 mice. In bone marrow chimeras between Slc7a2 and WT mice, the recipient genotype drove the CAC phenotype, suggesting the importance of epithelial SLC7A2 in abrogating neoplastic risk. These data reveal that SLC7A2 has a significant role in the protection from CAC in the setting of chronic colitis, and suggest that the decreased SLC7A2 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may contribute to CAC risk.

Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTBP1) has been found to be a regulator of glycolysis, however, the role of PTBP1 in drug resistance remains to be elucidated. Herein, we found that PTBP1 was highly expressed in two drug-resistant  cell lines, vincristine-resistant HCT-8 cell line (HCT-8/V) and oxaliplatin-resistant HCT116 cell line (HCT116/L-OHP). The levels of glucose consumption and lactate production as well as expression of pyruvate kinase  isoform (PKM2) and hexokinase II (HK2) were elevated, while PKM1 level was reduced in HCT-8/V and HCT116/L-OHP cells when compared with the HCT-8 and HCT116 cells. PTBP1 knockdown enhanced the sensitivity of HCT-8/V and HCT116/L-OHP cells to vincristine and oxaliplatin, and caused reduction in glucose consumption and lactate production. PKM2 expression, but not HK2, was decreased and PKM1 expression level was increased in cells transfected with si-PTBP1. In addition, PTBP1 overexpression significantly induced glycolysis and reduced drug sensitivity, whereas the effects were attenuated by si-PKM2. Treatment with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) also attenuated the effect of PTBP1 overexpression on drug sensitivity.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as a major actor in  tumorigenicity and metastasis, was involved in the interaction between TAMs and tumor cells. However, the potential mechanisms of EMT and how EMT-programmed tumor cells affect -like TAMs still need further exploration.An integrated analysis of nine CRC miRNA expression datasets was performed. Functional assays, including the EdU, clone formation, wound healing, and transwell assays, were used to determine the anticancer role of miR-195-5p in human CRC progression. Furthermore, RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA decay, and dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to determine the mechanism of miR-195-p CRC progression. Then co-culture, migration, and ELISA assays were applied to determine the role of miR-195-5p in macrophage recruitment and alternative polarization. Xenograft mouse models were used to determine the role of miR-195-5p in CRC tumorigenicity and TAM polarization in vivo.An integrated analysis confirmed that miR-195-5p was significantly downregulated in CRC tissues, and patients with a low level of miR-195-5p had significantly shortened overall survival as revealed by the TCGA-COAD dataset. Altered miR-195-5p in  cells led to distinct changes of proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT. Mechanistically, miR-195-5p regulated NOTCH2 expression in a post-transcriptional manner by directly binding to 3'-UTR of the Notch2 mRNA.

Studies have focused on the role of EGFR signaling in epithelial cells, although the exact nature of the role of EGFR in colorectal carcinogenesis remains a topic of debate. Here, we present evidence that EGFR signaling in myeloid cells, specifically macrophages, is critical for  tumorigenesis in the azoxymethane-dextran sodium sulfate (AOM-DSS) model of colitis-associated carcinogenesis (CAC). In a human tissue microarray,  macrophages demonstrated robust EGFR activation in the pre-cancerous stages of colitis and dysplasia. Utilizing the AOM-DSS model, mice with a myeloid-specific deletion of Egfr had significantly decreased tumor multiplicity and burden, protection from high-grade dysplasia and significantly reduced colitis. Intriguingly, mice with gastrointestinal epithelial cell-specific Egfr deletion demonstrated no differences in tumorigenesis in the AOM-DSS model. The alterations in tumorigenesis in myeloid-specific Egfr knockout mice were accompanied by decreased macrophage, neutrophil and T-cell infiltration. Pro-tumorigenic  macrophage activation was diminished in myeloid-specific Egfr-deficient mice, as marked by decreased Arg1 and Il10 mRNA expression and decreased interleukin (IL)-4, IL10 and IL-13 protein levels. Surprisingly, diminished M1 macrophage activation was also detectable, as marked by significantly reduced Nos2 and Il1b mRNA levels and decreased interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β protein levels. The alterations in M1 and  macrophage activation were confirmed in bone marrow-derived macrophages from mice with the myeloid-specific Egfr knockout. The combined effect of restrained M1 and  macrophage activation resulted in decreased production of pro-angiogenic factors, CXCL1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and reduced CD31 blood vessels, which likely contributed to protection from tumorigenesis. These data reveal that EGFR signaling in macrophages, but not in  epithelial cells, has a significant role in CAC.

However, the macrophage-derived molecular determinants that regulate colorectal  metastasis have not been fully characterized. Here, we demonstrate that  macrophage-regulated colorectal  cells' migration and invasion is dependent upon  macrophage-derived exosomes (MDE). MDE displayed a high expression level of miR-21-5p and miR-155-5p, and MDE-mediated colorectal  cells' migration and invasion depended on these two miRNAs. Mechanistically, miR-21-5p and miR-155-5p were transferred to colorectal  cells by MDE and bound to the BRG1 coding sequence, downregulating expression of BRG1, which has been identified as a key factor promoting the colorectal  metastasis, yet is downregulated in metastatic colorectal  cells. Collectively, these findings show that  macrophages induce colorectal  cells' migration and invasion and provide significant plasticity of BRG1 expression in response to tumor microenvironments during malignant progression. This dynamic and reciprocal cross-talk between colorectal  cells and  macrophages provides a new opportunity for the treatment of metastatic colorectal .

Given the emerging evidence on immune-microbiota interactions in CRC, we also sought to examine the interaction between macrophages and gut microbiota. To induce CRC, male C57BL/6 mice ( n = 32) received a single injection of azoxymethane (AOM), followed by three cycles of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-supplemented water in weeks 1, 4, and 7. Prior to the final DSS cycle ( week 7) and twice weekly until euthanasia, mice ( n = 16/group) received either 200 μl ip of clodronate-filled liposomes (CLD) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) encapsulated liposomes to deplete macrophages.  tissue was analyzed for polyp burden, macrophage markers, transcription factors, and inflammatory mediators. Stool samples were collected, and DNA was isolated and subsequently sequenced for 16S rRNA. Clodronate liposomes decreased tumor number by ∼36% and specifically large (≥1 mm) tumors by ∼36% ( P < 0.05). This was consistent with a decrease in gene expression of EMR1 in the  tissue and polyp tissue as well as expression of select markers associated with M1 (IL-6) and  macrophages (IL-13, IL-10, TGFβ, CCL17) in the  tissue ( P < 0.05). Similarly, there was a decrease in STAT3 and p38 MAPK and ERK signaling in  tissue. Clodronate liposomes increased the relative abundance of the Firmicutes phylum ( P < 0.05) and specifically Lactobacillaceae and Clostridiaceae families, which have been associated with reduced CRC risk. Overall, these data support the development of therapeutic strategies to target macrophages in CRC and provide support for further evaluation of immune-microbiota interactions in CRC. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We found that macrophage depletion during late-stage tumorigenesis is effective at reducing tumor growth. This was associated with a decrease in macrophage markers and chemokines in the  tissue and a decrease in transcription factors that are linked to colorectal .

Elevated Fgl2 levels are observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but little is known about its functional significance. In this study, we sought to investigate the role of Fgl2 in the development of intestinal inflammation and colitis-associated colorectal  (CAC). Here, we report that Fgl2 deficiency increased susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis and CAC in a mouse model. During colitis development, the expression of the membrane-bound and secreted forms of Fgl2 (mFgl2 and sFgl2, respectively) in the  were increased and predominantly expressed by  macrophages. In addition, using bone marrow chimeric mice, we determined that Fgl2 function in colitis is strictly related to its expression in the hematopoietic cells. Loss of Fgl2 induced the polarization of M1, but suppressed that of  both  and , independent of intestinal inflammation. Thus, Fgl2 suppresses intestinal inflammation and CAC development through its role in macrophage polarization and may serve as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases, including IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29238041>FoxO1 is a regulator of MHC-II expression and anti-tumor effect of tumor-associated macrophages.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are a critical component in host immune responses against tumor. In this work we investigated the role of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) in the transcriptional regulation in macrophages, which affects the anti-tumor functions of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). First, we showed that TAMs expressed reduced levels of FoxO1, which was associated with their protumoral  polarization state. The suppression of FoxO1 expression in TAM was induced by the hypoxic condition in the tumor microenviroment. Next, we confirmed that FoxO1 positively regulates MHC-II genes by binding to the promoter region of Ciita gene, the master activator of multiple MHC-II genes. Loss of FoxO1 in TAMs resulted in reduced MHC-II expression. Furthermore, we used FoxO1 conditional knockout mice to show that FoxO1 deficiency in myeloid cells exacerbates tumor growth. These results demonstrate that the protumoral property of TAMs is induced by the hypoxia-triggered FoxO1 deficiency, which could be a potential target of novel anti-tumor therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29864112>Hand grip strength and cognitive function among elderly  survivors.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the associations of handgrip strength and cognitive function in  survivors ≥ 60 years old using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).Data in two waves of NHANES (2011-2014) were aggregated. Handgrip strength in kilogram (kg) was defined as the maximum value achieved using either hand. Two cognitive function tests were conducted among adults 60 years and older. The Animal Fluency Test (AFT) examines categorical verbal fluency (a component of executive function), and the Digital Symbol Substitution test (DSST) assesses processing speed, sustained attention, and working memory. Survey analysis procedures were used to account for the complex sampling design of the NHANES. Multiple linear regression models were used to estimate associations of handgrip strength with cognitive test scores, adjusting for confounders (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, smoking status, depressive symptoms and leisure time physical activity).Among 383  survivors (58.5% women, mean age = 70.9 years, mean BMI = 29.3 kg/), prevalent  types were breast (22.9%), prostate (16.4%),  (6.9%) and cervix (6.2%). In women, each increase in kg of handgrip strength was associated with 0.20 (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.33) higher score on AFT and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.30 to 1.35) higher score on DSST. In men, we observed an inverted U-shape association where cognitive function peaked at handgrip strength of 40-42 kg.Handgrip strength, a modifiable factor, appears to be associated with aspects of cognitive functions in  survivors.

Previously, we have shown that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), an important component of the tumor microenvironment, are enriched in tumors compared with normal tissue and confer a poorer prognosis. In the present study, we found that matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9), which degrades extracellular matrix proteins, was increased in biopsies from  patients and in mouse xenografts with SW480 cell-derived tumors. SW480  cells exposed to -like macrophage-conditioned medium (-medium) exhibited increased MMP-9 mRNA, protein expression and gelatinase activity. A similar effect was obtained by the addition of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and leukotriene D (LTD ). MMP-9 expression and activity were reduced by a TNFα blocking antibody adalimumab and a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1, the receptor for LTD ) antagonist montelukast. -medium also induced changes in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers E-cadherin, β-catenin, vimentin, and snail in SW480 cells. We also found that both -medium and TNFα and LTD induced stabilization/nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Furthermore, we also observed an elongated phenotype that may indicate increased invasiveness, as confirmed in a collagen I invasion assay. -medium increased the invasive ability, and a similar effect was also obtained by the addition of TNFα and LTD . The specific MMP inhibitor I or adalimumab and montelukast reduced the number of invasive cells. In conclusion, our findings show that -medium enriched in TNFα and LTD promote  cell invasion via MMP-9 expression and activation and the induction of EMT.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29214019>PKM2 is not required for  initiated by APC loss.</a></h2><p> cells express the  isoform of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM2). PKM2 expression is not required for some cancers, and PKM2 loss can promote  progression; however, PKM2 has been reported to be essential in other tumor contexts, including a proposed non-metabolic role in β-catenin nuclear translocation. PKM2 is expressed in  cancers where loss of the  tumor suppressor results in β-catenin nuclear translocation and aberrant activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Whether PKM2 is required in this  context has not been investigated. tumorigenesis was induced in mice harboring conditional  and  alleles, and tumor progression was monitored by serial colonoscopy. PKM2 deletion had no effect on overall survival, the number of mice that developed tumors, or the number of tumors that developed per animal. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated PKM2 expression in wild-type tumors and the expected loss of PKM2 expression in tumors from  conditional mice. Loss of PKM2 resulted in pyruvate kinase M1 expression but had no effect on nuclear β-catenin staining. These findings are consistent with tumor growth and activated Wnt signaling despite PKM2 loss in this model. We also found a large fraction of human  cancers had very low or undetectable levels of PKM2 expression.PKM2 is not required for -deficient  or for nuclear translocation of β-catenin in -null tumor cells.

Here, we report that machilin A (MA), which acts as a competitive inhibitor by blocking the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) binding site of LDHA, suppresses growth of  cells and lactate production in various  cell types, including , breast, lung, and liver cancers. Furthermore, MA markedly decreased LDHA activity, lactate production, and intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels induced by hypoxia-induced LDHA expression in  cells, and significantly inhibited colony formation, leading to reduced  cell survival. In mouse models inoculated with murine Lewis lung carcinoma, MA significantly suppressed tumor growth as observed by a reduction of tumor volume and weight; resulting from the inhibition of LDHA activity. Subsequently, the suppression of tumor-derived lactic acid in MA-treated  cells resulted in decrease of neovascularization through the regulation of alternatively activated macrophages () polarization in macrophages. Taken together, we suggest that the reduction of lactate by MA in  cells directly results in a suppression of  cell growth. Furthermore, macrophage polarization and activation of endothelial cells for angiogenesis were indirectly regulated preventing lactate production in MA-treated  cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26487650>Are we operating too late?

With some literature consideration, we report that ovarian metastasis triggered the diagnosis of unresectable advanced gastric  with long-term survival through multidisciplinary treatment. This is the case of a 69-year-old woman, who was diagnosed with ovarian tumor and underwent right extracorporectomy and omentum resection in 2011. Pathological diagnosis suspected adenocarcinoma. In February 2012, EGD found a type 4 tumor in the upper portion of the pyloric area of the stomach. She was diagnosed with gastric  with Stage IV(T4aN0M1 [ovary])ovarian metastasis.

However, evidence relating to bile acids and intestinal tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of DCA on the intestinal mucosal barrier and its impact on the development of CRC. Here we showed that DCA disrupted cell monolayer integrity and increased proinflammatory cytokine production in intestinal  and precancerous cell lines (Caco-2 and IMCE). Apcmin/+ mice receiving DCA increased the number and size of intestinal adenomas and promoted the adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence. Importantly, DCA induced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, increased the production of inflammatory cytokines, and led to intestinal low grade inflammation. A reduction of tight junction protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and the number of intestinal cells including goblet cells and Paneth cells was also observed after DCA treatment. Moreover, DCA significantly reduced the level of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), and promoted the polarization of  macrophages in the intestine of Apcmin/+ mice.

Recent studies have identified -initiating cells (CICs) as a subgroup of replication-competent cells in the development of colorectal . Although it is understood that an inflammation-rich tumor microenvironment presumably supports CIC functions, the contributory factors are not very well defined. The present study advances our understanding of the role of the eicosanoids leukotriene D4 (LTD4) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the tumorigenic ability of CICs and investigates the consequential changes occurring in the tumor environment that might support tumor growth.In this study we used human HCT-116  ALDH(+) cells in a nude mouse xenograft model. Protein expression and immune cell was determined in tumor-dispersed cells by flow cytometry and in tumor sections by immunohistochemistry. mRNA expressions were quantified using RT-q-PCR and plasma cytokine levels by Multiplex ELISA.We observed that LTD4 and PGE2 treatment augmented CIC-induced tumor growth. LTD4-and PGE2-treated xenograft tumors revealed a robust increase in ALDH and Dclk1 protein expression, coupled with activated β-catenin signaling and COX-2 up-regulation. Furthermore, LTD4 or PGE2 accentuated the accumulation of CD45 expressing cells within xenograft tumors. Further analysis revealed that these infiltrating immune cells consisted of neutrophils (LY6G) and  type macrophages (CD206(+)). In addition, LTD4 and PGE2 treatment significantly elevated the plasma levels of cysteinyl leukotrienes and PGE2, as well as levels of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α and CXCL1/KC/GRO. In addition, increased mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 were detected in tumors from mice that had been treated with LTD4 or PGE2.Our data suggest that both LTD4 and PGE2 promote CICs in initiating tumor growth by allowing modifications in the tumor environment.

Here, we demonstrate that YAP1 expression is associated with  tumor-associated macrophage polarization and the generation of  stem-like cells. YAP1 downregulation by gene silencing or a phytochemical, ovatodiolide, not only suppresses  tumorigenesis but also prevents  TAM polarization.Human monocytic cells, THP-1, and  cell lines, HCT116 and DLD-1, were co-cultured to mimic the interactions between tumor and its microenvironment.  polarization of the THP-1 cells were examined using both flow cytometry and q-PCR technique.

The molecular consequences of YAP1 inhibition was demonstrated via colony formation, migration, and -sphere formation assays. 5-FU and ovatodiolide were used in drug combination studies. Xenograft and syngeneic mouse models were used to investigate the role of YAP1 in  tumorigenesis and TAM generation.An increased YAP1 expression was found to be associated with a poor prognosis in patients with  using bioinformatics approach. We showed an increased YAP1 expression in the  spheres, and  cells co-cultured with  TAMs. YAP1-silencing led to the concomitant decreased expression of major oncogenic pathways including Kras, mTOR, β-catenin, and -promoting IL-4 and tumor-promoting IL-6 cytokines. TAM co-cultured  spheres showed a significantly higher tumor-initiating ability in vivo.

As a follow‑up of a previous study we have investigated the effect of conditioned media (CM) from macrophages of M1 or  phenotypes on 5‑FU cytotoxicity on the  cell lines HT‑29 and CACO‑2. HT‑29 cells, but not CACO‑2 cells, having been treated with a combination of M1 CM and 5‑FU recovered their cell growth to a much larger extent compared to cells having been treated with 5‑FU alone when further cultured for 7 days in fresh media. M1 CM treatment of HT‑29, but not CACO‑2 cells, induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases. 5‑FU treatment induced accumulation of cells in S‑phase in both HT‑29 and CACO‑2 cells. This accumulation of cells in S‑phase was attenuated by combined M1 CM and 5‑FU treatment in HT‑29 cells, but not in CACO‑2 cells. The mRNA expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins and 5‑FU metabolic enzymes were analyzed in an attempt to find possible mechanisms for the M1 CM induced attenuation of 5‑FU cytotoxicity in HT‑29. Thymidylate synthetase (TS) and thymidine phosphorylase (TP) were found to be substantially downregulated and upregulated, respectively, in HT‑29 cells treated with M1 CM, making them unlikely as mediators of reduced 5‑FU cytotoxicity. Among cell cycle regulating proteins, p21 was induced in HT‑29 cells, but not in CACO‑2 cells, in response to M1 CM treatment. However, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of p21 had no effect on the M1 CM induced cell cycle arrest seen in HT‑29 and neither did it change the growth recovery after combined treatment of HT‑29 cells with M1 CM and 5‑FU. In conclusion, treatment of HT‑29 cells with M1 CM reduces the cytotoxic effect of 5‑FU and this is mediated by a M1 CM induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases.

We hypothesized that increased intestinal cell turnover beginning in childhood may explain the increased risk of malignancy in early adulthood. Therefore, we aimed to measure fecal -pyruvate kinase (-PK), a biomarker of intestinal cell turnover, in children with CF. To assess whether the increased cell turnover is secondary to intestinal inflammation, the secondary aims were to measure fecal calprotectin and evaluate its association with fecal -PK.Fecal samples, for -PK and calprotectin measurements, were prospectively collected from children with CF and healthy controls (HC).Thirty-three children with CF (mean [standard deviation] 7.3 [3.8] years old; 29 pancreatic insufficient [PI]) were enrolled and compared with 33 age-matched HC. Fecal -PK in CF patients (median [interquartile range, IQR]: 4.7 [1.5-9.7]) was greater than HC (1.0 [1.0-1.0] U/mL; P < 0.0001), and higher in PI (median [IQR]: 5.1 [1.8-13.7]) than pancreatic sufficient patients (1.0 [1.0-1.0] U/mL; P = 0.002). Fecal calprotectin was significantly elevated in CF than HC (median [IQR] 61.3 [43.8-143.8] vs 19.5 [19.5-35.1] mg/kg; P < 0.0001). However, there was no correlation between fecal -PK and fecal calprotectin levels among subjects with CF (r = 0.29; P = 0.1).Increased intestinal cell turnover is present in children with PI CF. The lack of relationship between fecal -PK and calprotectin suggests that contributing factor(s) other than inflammation may be present.© 2014 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296243>Intestinal dysbacteriosis-induced IL-25 promotes development of HCC via alternative activation of macrophages in tumor microenvironment.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota and the tumor microenvironment are thought to be critical factors that modulate the processes of liver diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Dysbiosis of gut microflora was induced by antibiotics (vancomycin, cefoperazone or combination of ampicillin, neomycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin). We used feces suspension to treat  epithelial NCM460 cells, and detected IL-25 and tuft cell marker DCLK1 using WB and immunofluorescence staining.We found that the level of IL-25 was significantly elevated in HCC patients, and was negatively correlated with survival rate after hepatectomy. However, IL-25 did not directly promote the development of HCC cells. Then, we observed the significant positive correlation between IL-25 level and  percentage (CD206/CD68) in HCC tumors. In vitro and in vivo, IL-25 induced alternative activation of macrophages promoted HCC cell migration, invasion and tumorigenesis, increased the expression of vimentin, Snail and phospho-ERK, and decreased the expression of E-cadherin in HCC cells. After IL-25 treatment, chemokine CXCL10 was increased in macrophages. Neutralizing CXCL10 in macrophage-conditioned medium reversed the IL-25-mediated effect on HCC cells. Vancomycin-induced dysbiosis promoted the growth of orthotopic HCC homograft. Surprisedly, we found the hyperplasia of  epithelial tuft cells, from which more IL-25 was secreted .IL-25 promotes the progression of HCC through inducing alternative activation and CXCL10 secretion of macrophages in tumor microenvironment, and IL-25 secretion may partly result from hyperplastic epithelial tuft cells in , induced by gut microbiota dysbiosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27776738>Bone marrow-derived innate macrophages attenuate oxazolone-induced colitis.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown that a subpopulation of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-dependent F4/80 CD11b innate macrophages could be derived from bone marrow cells by continuous in vitro culturing. These cells could be induced to differentiate into M1 or  macrophages in vitro. In the current study, we sought to determine whether bone marrow cell-derived innate macrophages (BMIMs) could be used to fulfill an anti-inflammatory purpose by intravenous transplantation in vivo after being stimulated to differentiate into  macrophages. Because Th2 cytokines, such as interleukin IL-4 and IL-13, can induce macrophage polarization into  macrophages, we treated the BMIMs with IL-4 and IL-13 in vitro. Next, the  macrophages were intravenously transplanted into a typical Th2-mediated inflammatory disease model, oxazolone (OXZ)-induced colitis, to assess the anti-inflammatory activity of BMIM-derived  macrophages (BMIM-M2Ms) in vivo. After transplantation, the severity of intestinal inflammation was attenuated. In addition,  lengths and mouse body weights were noticeably improved. F4/80 CD206 double-positive cells (displaying the markers of  macrophages) had accumulated in the  tissue of BMIM-M2M-transplanted mice. This evidence demonstrated that bone marrow-derived BMIM-M2Ms could be used to alleviate OXZ-induced Th2-mediated inflammation in a mouse model in vivo.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TAMs are a potential target for adjuvant  therapies due to their established roles in promoting proliferation of  cells, angiogenesis, and metastasis. We previously discovered an  macrophage-targeting peptide (M2pep) which was successfully used to target and deliver a pro-apoptotic KLA peptide to -like TAMs in a CT-26  carcinoma model. However, the effectiveness of in vivo TAM-targeting using M2pep is limited by its poor serum stability and low binding affinity. In this study, we synthesized M2pep derivatives with the goals of increasing serum stability and binding affinity. Serum stability evaluation of M2pepBiotin confirmed its rapid degradation attributed to exolytic cleavage from the N-terminus and endolytic cleavages at the W10/W11 and S16/K17 sites. N-terminal acetylation of M2pepBiotin protected the peptide against the exolytic degradation while W10w and K(17,18,19)k substitutions were able to effectively protect endolytic degradation at their respective cleavage sites. However, no tested amino acid changes at the W10 position resulted in both protease resistance at that site and retention of binding activity. Therefore, cyclization of M2pep was investigated. Cyclized M2pep better resisted serum degradation without compromising binding activity to  macrophages. During the serum stability optimization process, we also discovered that K9R and W10Y substitutions significantly enhanced binding affinity of M2pep. In an in vitro binding study of different M2pep analogs pre-incubated in mouse serum, cyclic M2pep with K9R and W10Y modifications (cyclic M2pep(RY)) retained the highest binding activity to  macrophages over time due to its improved serum stability. Finally, we evaluated the in vivo accumulation of sulfo-Cy5-labeled M2pep and cyclic M2pep(RY) in both the CT-26 and 4T1 breast carcinoma models. Cyclic M2pep(RY) outperformed M2pep in both tumor localization and selective accumulation in -like TAMs. In conclusion, we report cyclic M2pep(RY) as our lead M2pep analog with improved serum stability and  macrophage-binding activity. Its enhanced utility as an in vivo -like-TAM-targeting agent was demonstrated in two tumor models, and is expected to be applicable for other tumor models or in models of  macrophage-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27507810>Activation of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor in Macrophages Mediates Feedback Inhibition of  Polarization and Gastrointestinal Tumor Cell Growth.</a></h2><p>EGF receptor (EGFR) in tumor cells serves as a tumor promoter. However, information about EGFR activation in macrophages in regulating  polarization and tumor development is limited. This study aimed to investigate the effects of EGFR activation in macrophages on  polarization and development of gastrointestinal tumors. IL-4, a cytokine to elicit  polarization, stimulated release of an EGFR ligand, HB-EGF, and transactivation and down-regulation of EGFR in Raw 264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages from WT mice. Knockdown of HB-EGF in macrophages inhibited EGFR transactivation by IL-4. IL-4-stimulated STAT6 activation, Arg1 and YM1 gene expression, and HB-EGF production were further enhanced by inhibition of EGFR activity in Raw 264.7 cells using an EGFR kinase inhibitor and in peritoneal macrophages from Egfr(wa5) mice with kinase inactive EGFR and by knockdown of EGFR in peritoneal macrophages from Egfr(fl/fl) LysM-Cre mice with myeloid cell-specific EGFR deletion. Chitin induced a higher level of  polarization in peritoneal macrophages in Egfr(fl/fl) LysM-Cre mice than that in Egfr(fl/fl) mice. Accordingly, IL-4-conditioned medium stimulated growth and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in gastric epithelial and  tumor cells, which were suppressed by that from Raw 264.7 cells with HB-EGF knockdown but promoted by that from Egfr(wa5) and Egfr(fl/fl) LysM-Cre peritoneal macrophages. Clinical assessment revealed that the number of macrophages with EGFR expression became less, indicating decreased inhibitory effects on  polarization, in late stage of human gastric cancers. Thus, IL-4-stimulated HB-EGF-dependent transactivation of EGFR in macrophages may mediate inhibitory feedback for  polarization and HB-EGF production, thereby inhibiting gastrointestinal tumor growth.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28416140>Ribonucleotide Reductase Requires Subunit Switching in Hypoxia to Maintain DNA Replication.</a></h2><p>Cells exposed to hypoxia experience replication stress but do not accumulate DNA damage, suggesting sustained DNA replication. Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is the only enzyme capable of de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). However, oxygen is an essential cofactor for mammalian RNR (RRM1/RRM2 and RRM1/RRM2B), leading us to question the source of dNTPs in hypoxia. Here, we show that the RRM1/RRM2B enzyme is capable of retaining activity in hypoxia and therefore is favored over RRM1/RRM2 in order to preserve ongoing replication and avoid the accumulation of DNA damage. We found two distinct mechanisms by which RRM2B maintains hypoxic activity and identified responsible residues in RRM2B. The importance of RRM2B in the response to tumor hypoxia is further illustrated by correlation of its expression with a hypoxic signature in patient samples and its roles in tumor growth and radioresistance. Our data provide mechanistic insight into RNR biology, highlighting RRM2B as a hypoxic-specific, anti- therapeutic target.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Since the levels of tumor markers increased, the 5-FU dose was increased from 2,700 to 3,000 mg/ using a Jackson-type pump and an extended infusion time of 53 hours. The blood level of 5-FU was 507 ng/mL 16 hours after starting the infusion. The pump was then changed to a bottle-type pump with the same dose of 3,000 mg/. At 16 hours, the 5-FU level was 964.5 ng/mL. The areas under the concentration vs. time curve (AUC mg・h/L)were 21 and 44 mg・h/L for the Jackson- and bottle-type pumps, respectively. Owing to the development of Grade 3 stomatitis and hand-foot syndrome, 5-FU was reduced to 2,700 mg/ with a bottle-type pump. The AUC decreased to 27 mg・h/L, but the liver metastases were reduced and the adverse effects subsided to Grade 1.

It has been reported that response gene to complement 32 (RGC-32) promotes  macrophage polarization. However, whether RGC-32 expression in macrophages could play a potential role in tumor progression remain unclear. Here we identified that increasing RGC-32 expression in  and tumor associated macrophages was positively correlated with  progression. In vitro studies confirmed that  cells upregulated RGC-32 expression of macrophages via secreting TGF-β1. RGC-32 expression promoted macrophage migration. In addition, stimulation of HCT-116 cells with the condition mediums of RGC-32-silienced or over-expressed macrophages affected tumor cell colony formation and migration via altered COX-2 expression. In an animal model, macrophages with RGC-32 knockdown significantly decreased the expression of COX-2 and Ki67 in the xenografts, and partly inhibited tumor growth. Together, our results provide the evidences for a critical role of TGF-β1/RGC-32 pathway in TAMs and  cells during tumor progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28829588>Apigenin Restrains  Cell Proliferation via Targeted Blocking of Pyruvate Kinase -Dependent Glycolysis.</a></h2><p>Apigenin (AP), as an anticancer agent, has been widely explored. However, the molecular targets of apigenin on tumor metabolism are unclear. Herein, we found that AP could block cellular glycolysis through restraining the tumor-specific pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) activity and expression and further significantly induce anti- effects. The IC values of AP against HCT116, HT29, and DLD1 cells were 27.9 ± 2.45, 48.2 ± 3.01 and 89.5 ± 4.89 μM, respectively. Fluorescence spectra and solid-phase AP extraction assays proved that AP could directly bind to PKM2 and markedly inhibit PKM2 activity in vitro and in HCT116 cells. Interestingly, in the presence of d-fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FBP), the inhibitory effect of AP on PKM2 was not reversed, which suggests that AP is a new allosteric inhibitor of PKM2. RT-PCR and Western blot assays showed that AP could ensure a low PKM2/PKM1 ratio in HCT116 cells via blocking the β-catenin/c-Myc/PTBP1 signal pathway. Hence, PKM2 represents a novel potential target of AP against .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27683110>Polarization of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment is influenced by EGFR signaling within  cells.</a></h2><p>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a target of  therapy, but the effects of this therapy on the tumor microenvironment remain poorly understood. Our in vivo studies showed that cetuximab, an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, effectively inhibited AOM/DSS-induced, colitis-associated tumorigenesis, downregulated -related markers, and decreased F4/80+/CD206+ macrophage populations. Treatment with conditioned medium of  cells increased macrophage expression of the -related markers arginase-1 (Arg1), CCL17, CCL22, IL-10 and IL-4. By contrast, conditioned medium of EGFR knockout  cells inhibited expression of these -related markers and induced macrophage expression of the M1-related markers inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), IL-12, TNF-α and CCR7. EGFR knockout in  cells inhibited macrophage-induced promotion of xenograft tumor growth. Moreover, -derived insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) increased Arg1 expression, and treatment with the IGF1R inhibitor AG1024 inhibited that increase. These results suggest that inhibition of EGFR signaling in  cells modulates cytokine secretion (e.g. IGF-1) and prevents M1-to- macrophage polarization, thereby inhibiting  cell growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28368514>Vitamin D Receptor-Dependent Signaling Protects Mice From Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Colitis.</a></h2><p>Low vitamin D status potentiates experimental colitis, but the vitamin D-responsive cell in colitis has not been defined. We hypothesized that vitamin D has distinct roles in  epithelial cells and in nonepithelial cells during colitis. We tested this hypothesis by using mice with vitamin D receptor (VDR) deletion from  epithelial cells (CEC-VDRKO) or nonintestinal epithelial cells (NEC-VDRKO). Eight-week-old mice were treated with 1.35% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 5 days and then euthanized 2 or 10 days after removal of DSS. DSS induced body weight loss and increased disease activity index and spleen size. This response was increased in NEC-VDRKO mice but not CEC-VDRKO mice. DSS-induced  epithelial damage and immune cell infiltration scores were increased in both mouse models. Although the epithelium healed between 2 and 10 days after DSS administration in control and CEC-VDRKO mice, epithelial damage remained high in NEC-VDRKO mice 10 days after removal of DSS, indicating delayed epithelial healing. Gene expression levels for the proinflammatory, M1 macrophage (Mɸ) cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, nitric oxide synthase 2, and interleukin-1β were significantly elevated in the  of NEC-VDRKO mice at day 10. In vitro experiments in murine peritoneal Mɸs demonstrated that 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D directly inhibited M1 polarization, facilitated  polarization, and regulated Mɸ phenotype switching toward the  and away from the M1 phenotype.

CRC can be prevented by routine screening, which can detect precancerous lesions. The aim of this study is to clarify whether faecal occult blood test (i-FOBT), tumor  pyruvate kinase (t--PK), and endocannabinoid system molecules (cannabinoid receptors type 1-CB1, type 2-CB2, and fatty acid amide hydrolase-FAAH) might represent better diagnostic tools, alone or in combination, for an early diagnosis of CRC. An immunochemical FOB test (i-FOBT) and quantitative ELISA stool test for t--PK were performed in 127 consecutive patients during a 12 month period. Endocannabinoid system molecules and t--PK expression were detected by immunostaining in healthy tissues and normal mucosa surrounding adenomatous and cancerous  lesions. i-FOBT and t--PK combination leads to a better diagnostic accuracy for pre-neoplastic and neoplastic  lesions. T--PK quantification in stool samples and in biopsy samples (immunostaining) correlates with tumourigenesis stages. CB1 and CB2 are well expressed in healthy tissues, and their expression decreases in the presence of advanced stages of carcinogenesis and disappears in CRC. FAAH signal is well expressed in normal mucosa and low-risk adenoma, and increased in high-risk adenoma and carcinoma adjacent tissues. This study shows that high levels of t--PK in addition to FOBT enhance the power of a CRC screening test. Endocannabinoid system molecule expression correlates with  carcinogenesis stages. Developing future faecal tests for their quantification must be undertaken to obtain a more accurate early non-invasive diagnosis for CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28055016>Inhibition of Stat3 signaling pathway by nifuroxazide improves antitumor immunity and impairs colorectal carcinoma metastasis.</a></h2><p>Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the one of the most common cancers with considerable metastatic potential, explaining the need for new drug candidates that inhibit tumor metastasis. The signal transducers and activators of the transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling pathway has an important role in CRC and has been validated as a promising anticancer target for CRC therapy. In the present study, we report our findings on nifuroxazide, an antidiarrheal agent identified as an inhibitor of Stat3. Our studies showed that nifuroxazide decreased the viability of three CRC cell lines and induced apoptosis of  cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, western blot analysis demonstrated that the occurrence of its apoptosis was correlated with the activation of Bax and cleaved caspase-3, and decreased the expression of Bcl-2. In addition, nifuroxazide markedly impaired CRC cell migration and invasion by downregulating phosphorylated-Stat3, and also impaired the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9). Furthermore, our studies showed that nifuroxazide also significantly inhibited the tumor metastasis in lung and abdomen metastasis models of . Meanwhile, nifuroxazide functionally reduced the proliferation index, induced tumor apoptosis and impaired metastasis. Notably, nifuroxazide reduced the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the blood, spleens and tumors, accompanied by the increased infiltration of CD8 T cells in the tumors. Importantly, a marked decrease in the number of -type macrophages in tumor in the abdomen metastasis model was also observed. Taken together, our results indicated that nifuroxazide could effectively inhibit tumor metastasis by mediating Stat3 pathway and it might have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28822392>Optimal Modified Frailty Index Cutoff in Older Gastrointestinal  Patients.</a></h2><p>The newly characterized modified frailty index (mFI) is a robust predictor of postoperative outcomes for surgical patients. The present study investigates the optimal cutoff for mFI specifically in older gastrointestinal (GI)  patients undergoing surgery. All patients more than 60 years old who underwent surgery for a GI malignancy (esophagus, stomach, , rectum, pancreas, liver, and bile duct) were identified in the 2005 to 2012 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, Participant Use Data File (NSQIP PUF). Patients undergoing emergency procedures, of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) five status, or diagnosed with preoperative sepsis were excluded. Logistic regression modeling and 10-fold cross validation were used to identify an optimal mFI cutoff. A total of 41,455 patients (mean age 72, 47.4% female) met the eligibility criteria. Among them, 19.0 per cent (n = 7891) developed a major postoperative complication and 2.8 per cent (n = 1150) died within 30 days. A random sampling by a  site was performed to create 90 per cent training and 10 per cent test sample datasets. Using 10-fold cross validation, logistical regression models evaluated the association between mFI and endpoints of 30-day mortality and major morbidity at various cutoffs. Optimal cutoffs for 30-day mortality and major morbidity were mFI ≥ 0.1 and ≥0.2, respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, ASA, albumin ≥3g/dl, and body mass index ≥ 30 kg/, mFI ≥ 0.1 was associated with increased mortality (odds ratio (OR) 1.49, 1.30-1.71 95% confidence interval (CI), P < 0.001) and mFI ≥ 0.2 was associated with increased morbidity (OR 1.52, 1.39-1.65 95% CI, P < 0.001).

After the tumor-bearing mice were treated with pexidartinib, we observed the effects of pexidartinib on the tumor growth, the survival of tumor-bearing mouse and the number of intratumoral tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) transgenic mice and then transferred into the tumor-bearing mice via tail vein.

Although the bioavailability of AVAs has been investigated previously, little is known about their metabolism.The aim of the present study was to investigate the metabolism of avenanthramide-C (2c), one of the major AVAs, in mice and by the human microbiota, as well as to elucidate the bioactivity of its major metabolites with the goal of finding new exposure markers to precisely reflect oat consumption.For the mouse study, 10 CF-1 female mice were divided into control (vehicle-treated) and 2c intragastrically treated (200 mg/kg) groups (5 mice/group). Twenty-four-hour urine and fecal samples were collected with use of metabolic cages. For the batch culture incubations, 2c was cultured with fecal slurries obtained from 6 human donors. Incubated samples were collected at various time points (0, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h). Metabolites were identified via HPLC with electrochemical detection and LC with electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry. To investigate whether 2c metabolites retain the biological effects of 2c, we compared their effects on the growth of and induction of apoptosis in HCT-116 human  cells.Eight metabolites were detected from the 2c-treated mouse urine samples. They were identified as 5-hydroxyanthranilic acid (M1), dihydrocaffeic acid (), caffeic acid (M3), dihydroferulic acid (M4), ferulic acid (M5), dihydroavenanthramide-C (M6), dihydroavenanthramide-B (M7), and avenanthramide-B (M8) via analysis of their MS(n) (n = 1-3) spectra. We found that the reduction of 2c's C7'-C8' double bond and the cleavage of its amide bond were the major metabolic routes. In the human microbiota study, 2c was converted into M1-M3 and M6. Moreover, interindividual differences in 2c metabolism were observed among the 6 human subjects. Subjects B, C, E, and F could rapidly metabolize 2c to M6, whereas subject D metabolized little 2c, even up to 120 h. In addition, only subjects A, B, and F could cleave the amide bond of 2c or M6 to form the cleaved metabolites. Furthermore, we showed that 2c and its major metabolite M6 are bioactive compounds against human  cells. M6 was more active than 2c with the half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 158 μM and could induce apoptosis at 200 μM.To our knowledge, the current study demonstrates for the first time that avenanthramide-C can be extensively metabolized by mice and the human microbiota to generate bioactive metabolites.© 2015 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27478914>Single-incision laparoscopic colorectal surgery: a report of 33 cases in Saudi Arabia.</a></h2><p>Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has gained worldwide acceptance as a minimally invasive technique in colorectal procedures since its introduction in 2008.

Using a  liver metastasis model in ICAM-1-deficient (ICAM-1(-/-)) mice and their wild-type littermates, we found that loss of ICAM-1 accelerated liver metastasis of  carcinoma cells. Moreover, ICAM-1 deficiency increased  macrophage polarization during tumor progression. We further demonstrated that ICAM-1 deficiency in macrophages led to promotion of efferocytosis of apoptotic tumor cells through activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt signaling pathway. More importantly, coculture of ICAM-1(-/-) macrophages with apoptotic  cells resulted in an increase of -like macrophages, which was blocked by an efferocytosis inhibitor. Our findings demonstrate a novel role for ICAM-1 in suppressing  macrophage polarization via downregulation of efferocytosis in the tumor microenvironment, thereby inhibiting metastatic tumor progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28768254>Intracorporeal versus Extracorporeal Anastomoses Following Laparoscopic Right Colectomy in Obese Patients: A Case-Matched Study.</a></h2><p>To compare short- and long-term outcomes of intracorporeal anastomosis (IA) versus extracorporeal anastomosis (EA) in obese (body mass index >30 kg/) patients.Sixty-four consecutive obese patients who underwent laparoscopic (LPS) right colectomy with IA were matched with 64 patients who underwent LPS right colectomy with EA. Intraoperative variables, short-term outcomes, readmission rates, and morbidity and mortality rates were analyzed along with long-term outcomes.Conversion to open surgery occurred in 4 patients in the IA group and 11 patients in the EA group (p = 0.097). The overall 30-day morbidity rate was 29.6% in the IA and 32.8% in the EA (p = 0.70). No 30-day mortality occurred. Anastomotic leak occurred in 4.7% of patients in the IA group vs. 7.8% in the EA group (p = 0.71). In the IA group, an earlier recovery of bowel function was observed (p = 0.01). No differences were observed with respect to the length of stay and reoperation rate. No 30-day readmission occurred in the IA compared to 5 patients readmitted in the EA group (p = 0.058). A higher incidence of incisional hernia was observed in the EA group (p = 0.033).IA in obese patients is associated with similar short-term outcomes, lower incidence of incisional hernias, and might possibly reduce the risk of hospital readmission.© 2017 S.

A target molecule of tasquinimod is the inflammatory protein S100A9 which has been shown to affect the accumulation and function of suppressive myeloid cell subsets in tumors. Given the major impact of myeloid cells to the tumor microenvironment, manipulation of this cell compartment is a desirable goal in  therapeutics.To understand the consequences of tasquinimod treatment on the TME, we evaluated early treatment effects in tumor infiltrating myeloid cells. Cellular phenotypes were studied by flow cytometry while gene expression both in tumor tissue and in isolated CD11b(+) cells or tumor cells were measured by real time-PCR. Effects on angiogenesis were monitored by changes in CD31 levels and by gene expression in tumor tissue. Effects on cytokine levels in tumor tissue and serum were determined by multiplex analysis.The MC38-C215  carcinoma tumors showed a substantial infiltration of primarily myeloid cells that were dominated by Ly6C(low)F4/80(+)CD206(+) -polarized tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), an immuno-suppressive and pro-angiogenic cell population. Here, we show that tasquinimod treatment induces an anti-tumor effect which is subsequent to a reduction in tumor infiltrating CD206(+)  macrophages and a simultaneous increase in M1 macrophages expressing MHC class II and CD86. The tasquinimod-induced changes in TAM polarization were evident within 24 h of exposure, emphasizing the ability of tasquinimod to rapidly reprogram the tumor microenvironment. This change in the tumor associated myeloid compartment preceded an increased IL12-production within the tumor and a decrease in tumor neovascularization. The switch in TAM polarization by tasquinimod was confirmed in the 4T1 breast  model where tasquinimod also reduce lung metastasis development.Our data show that tasquinimod affects tumor infiltrating myeloid cells early after exposure, leading to a change in phenotype from pro-angiogenic and immunosuppressive -like TAMs to pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages. These changes are consistent with the effects of tasquinimod seen on tumor vascularization, immune suppression and metastasis giving further insights to the anti-tumor mechanism of action of tasquinimod.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29554212>Combined immunotherapy encompassing intratumoral poly-ICLC, dendritic-cell vaccination and radiotherapy in advanced  patients.</a></h2><p>Combination immunotherapy has the potential to achieve additive or synergistic effects. Combined local injections of dsRNA analogues (mimicking viral RNA) and repeated vaccinations with tumor-lysate loaded dendritic cells shows efficacy against  mouse models. In the context of immunotherapy, radiotherapy can exert beneficial abscopal effects.In this two-cohort pilot phase I study, 15 advanced  patients received two 4-week cycles of four intradermal daily doses of monocyte-derived dendritic cells preloaded with autologous tumor lysate and matured for 24 h with poly-ICLC (Hiltonol), TNF-α and IFN-α. On days +8 and +10 of each cycle, patients received intratumoral image-guided 0.25 mg injections of the dsRNA-analogue Hiltonol. Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/ was administered 1 week before. Six patients received stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) on selected tumor lesions, including those injected with Hiltonol. Expression of 25 immune-relevant genes was sequentially monitored by RT-PCR on circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) and serum concentrations of a cytokine panel were sequentially determined before and during treatment. Pre- and post-treatment PBMC from patients achieving durable stable disease (SD) were studied by IFNγ ELISPOT-assays responding to tumor-lysate loaded DC and by TCRβ sequencing.Combined treatment was, safe and well tolerated. One heavily pretreated castration-resistant prostate  patient experienced a remarkable mixed abscopal response to SABR+ immunotherapy. No objective responses were observed, while nine patients presented SD (five of them in the six-patient radiotherapy cohort). Intratumoral Hiltonol increased IFN-β and IFN-α mRNA in circulating PBMC. DC vaccination increased serum IL-12 and IL-1β concentrations, especially in patients presenting SD. IFNγ-ELISPOT reactivity to tumor lysates was observed in two patients experiencing durable SD.This radio-immunotherapy combination strategy, aimed at resembling viral infection in tumor tissue in combination with a dendritic-cell vaccine and SABR, is safe and shows immune-associated activity and signs of preliminary clinical efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30682016>Cell type-specific differences in redox regulation and proliferation after low UVA doses.</a></h2><p>Ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation is harmful for living organisms but in low doses may stimulate cell proliferation. Our aim was to examine the relationships between exposure to different low UVA doses, cellular proliferation, and changes in cellular reactive oxygen species levels. In human  (HCT116) and melanoma (Me45) cells exposed to UVA doses comparable to environmental, the highest doses (30-50 kJ/) reduced clonogenic potential but some lower doses (1 and 10 kJ/) induced proliferation. This effect was cell type and dose specific. In both cell lines the levels of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide fluctuated with dynamics which were influenced differently by UVA; in Me45 cells decreased proliferation accompanied the changes in the dynamics of H2O2 while in HCT116 cells those of superoxide. Genes coding for proteins engaged in redox systems were expressed differently in each cell line; transcripts for thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin and glutathione peroxidase showed higher expression in HCT116 cells whereas those for glutathione transferases and copper chaperone were more abundant in Me45 cells. We conclude that these two cell types utilize different pathways for regulating their redox status. Many mechanisms engaged in maintaining cellular redox balance have been described. Here we show that the different cellular responses to a stimulus such as a specific dose of UVA may be consequences of the use of different redox control pathways. Assays of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide level changes after exposure to UVA may clarify mechanisms of cellular redox regulation and help in understanding responses to stressing factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28981199>MicroRNA-661 modulates redox and metabolic homeostasis in .</a></h2><p> cell survival and metastasis are dependent on metabolic reprogramming that is capable of increasing resistance to oxidative and energetic stress. Targeting these two processes can be crucial for  progression. Herein, we describe the role of microRNA-661 (miR661) as epigenetic regulator of  (CC) cell metabolism. MicroR661 induces a global increase in reactive oxygen species, specifically in mitochondrial superoxide anions, which appears to be mediated by decreased carbohydrate metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway, and by a higher dependency on mitochondrial respiration. MicroR661 overexpression in non-metastatic human CC cells induces an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype, and a reduced tolerance to metabolic stress. This seems to be a general effect of miR661 in CC, since metastatic CC cell metabolism is also compromised upon miR661 overexpression. We propose hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase  as two key players related to the observed metabolic reprogramming. Finally, the clinical relevance of miR661 expression levels in stage-II and III CC patients is discussed. In conclusion, we propose miR661 as a potential modulator of redox and metabolic homeostasis in CC.© 2017 The Authors.

Numerous cell types dictate monocyte differentiation into  TAMs via a complex network of cytokine-based communication. Elucidating critical pathways in this network can provide new targets for inhibiting metastasis. In this study, we focused on  cells, CAFs, and monocytes as a major node in this network. Monocyte cocultures with -stimulated CAFs were used to investigate differentiation into -like TAMs. Cytokine array analyses were employed to discover the CAF-derived regulators of differentiation. These regulators were validated in primary CAFs and bone marrow-derived monocytes. Orthotopic, syngeneic  carcinoma models using cotransplanted CAFs were established to observe effects on tumor growth and metastasis. To confirm a correlation with clinical evidence, meta-analyses were employed using the Oncomine database. Our coculture studies identify IL6 and GM-CSF as the pivotal signals released from  cell-activated CAFs that cooperate to induce monocyte differentiation into -like TAMs. In orthotopic, syngeneic  carcinoma mouse models, cotransplanted CAFs elevated IL6 and GM-CSF levels, TAM infiltration, and metastasis. These pathologic effects were dramatically reversed by joint IL6 and GM-CSF blockade. A positive correlation between GM-CSF and IL6 expression and disease course was observed by meta-analyses of the clinical data. Our studies indicate a significant reappraisal of the role of IL6 and GM-CSF in metastasis and implicate CAFs as the "henchmen" for  cells in producing an immunosuppressive tumor ecological niche. Dual targeting of GM-CSF and IL6 is a promising new approach for inhibiting metastasis. .©2018 American Association for  Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30259036>Tannic acid directly targets pyruvate kinase isoenzyme  to attenuate  cell proliferation.</a></h2><p>Tannic acid (TA), a naturally occurring polyphenolic acid that is primarily found in grapes and green tea, exhibits potent antioxidant and anticarcinogenic characteristics. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and targets of TA, which are responsible for  prevention, remain elusive. In the present study, we used TA-functionalized magnetite nanoparticles to identify pyruvate kinase isoenzyme  (PKM2) as the direct target of TA. We report that TA selectively inhibits the pyruvate kinase activity of PKM2, rather than protein kinase activity and PKM2 expression, to suppress colorectal  (CRC) cell proliferation. Furthermore, we had discovered that lysine residue 433 (K433) is a selective druggable site. Through direct binding to lysine residue 433, TA triggers the dissociation of PKM2 tetramers and further blocks the metabolic activity of PKM2. Notably, TA has no effect on PKM1 activity as TA does not bind to it. Taken together, these findings show that TA is worthy of consideration as a promising PKM2 inhibitor for the prevention of CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30996297>Loss of PKM2 in Lgr5 intestinal stem cells promotes colitis-associated colorectal .</a></h2><p>The regulatory properties of pyruvate kinase  isoform (PKM2), the key glycolytic enzyme, influence altered energy metabolism including glycolysis in . In this study, we found that PKM2 was highly expressed in patients with ulcerative colitis or colorectal  (CRC). We then investigated the effectiveness of conditionally ablating PKM2 in Lgr5 intestinal stem cells (ISC) using a mouse model of colitis-associated CRC (AOM plus DSS). Tamoxifen-inducible Lgr5-driven deletion of PKM2 in ISC (PKM2-Tx) significantly promoted tumor incidence and size in the  and lower body weight compared with findings in vehicle-treated mice (PKM2-Veh). Histopathologic analysis revealed considerable high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma in the  of PKM2-Tx mice while PKM2-Veh mice had low- and high-grade dysplasia. Loss of PKM2 was associated with dominant expression of PKM1 in Lgr5 ISC and their progeny cells. Further, the organoid-forming efficiency of whole  cells or Lgr5 cells obtained from  polyps of PKM2-Tx mice was significantly increased when compared with PKM2-Veh mice.  organoids from PKM2-Tx mice exhibited increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and a shift of metabolites involved in energy metabolism. These findings suggest that loss of PKM2 function in ISC promotes colitis-associated CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088266> Cell Secretes EGF to Promote  Polarization of TAM Through EGFR/PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway.</a></h2><p>Tumor environment has been recognized to affect  cell progression, such as tumor-associated macrophages. However, increasing evidences suggest that tumor cells are capable of regulating polarization of tumor-associated macrophages. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of how  cell impacts tumor-associated macrophages polarization.We employed flow cytometry to detect marker molecules on macrophage membrane, such as CD68, CD16, and CD204. In addition, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to examine the level of these cytokines (interleukin-6, interleukin-1β, interleukin-10, and Arginase-1) secreted by  cells into the culture medium. Western blot was utilized to probe downstream proteins of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.We cocultured  cell lines (HCT8 or HCT116) with human myeloid leukemia mononuclear cells (THP-1) and found that interleukin-6 and interleukin-1β levels were reduced, and instead, interleukin-10 and Arginase-1 levels were elevated, suggesting that  cells contributed to  polarization of THP-1. Meanwhile, high level of various growth factors (transforming growth factor-β [TGF-β], epidermal growth factor [EGF], and hepatocyte growth factor [HGF]) was observed in the medium of THP-1 cocultured with  cells. Furthermore, the protein level of phosphorylated PI3K, AKT, and mTOR significantly increased in THP-1 cell cocultured with  cells compared to THP-1 group. Besides, we established that  cells exerted their stimulatory effect on  polarization of macrophage from monocyte THP-1 using EGFR antibody mAb225 and PI3K inhibitor LY294002.We provide evidence that EGF which are secreted by  cells play contributory role in  polarization of macrophages, which support the notion that tumor environment, including tumor-associated macrophages, can be targeted to develop effective strategies for treating .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29368606>PKN2 in  cells inhibits  phenotype polarization of tumor-associated macrophages via regulating DUSP6-Erk1/2 pathway.</a></h2><p>Protein kinase N2 (PKN2) is a PKC-related serine/threonine-protein kinase. PKN2 is required for tumor cell migration, invasion and apoptosis. However, the functional role of PKN2 in regulating tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization in  has never been reported.PKN2 expression in human  tissues was examined with immunohistochemistry (IHC). M1/ macrophage signatures were evaluated by RT-PCR, IHC and flow cytometry. The effects of PKN2 on tumor growth and TAM polarization were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. PKN2 targeted cytokines/pathway were analyzed by gene expression analysis and further confirmed by PCR, luciferase assay or western blot. Correlations between PKN2 and transcriptional factors for IL4 and IL10 were confirmed by ChIP-qPCR. The catalytic activities of PKN2 and DUSP6 were determined by kinase activity assay. Interactions between PKN2 and DUSP6 were confirmed by Co-IP.The expression of PKN2 in  cells predicted a favorable prognosis and was associated with low  macrophage content in human  tissues. PKN2 inhibited tumor growth in mice xenograft model and inhibited  phenotype polarization both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, PKN2 suppresses the expression of IL4 and IL10 from  cells by inhibiting Erk1/2 phosphorylation, which is required for phosphorylation and binding of CREB and Elk-1 to the promoters of IL4 and IL10. DUSP6, which is phosphorylated and activated through direct association with PKN2, suppresses Erk1/2 activation.The expression of PKN2 in  cells suppresses tumor associated  macrophage polarization and tumor growth.

Many screening programmes include an initial faecal occult blood test (FOBt) prior to colonoscopy. To refine the selection of patients for colonoscopy other faecal-based diagnostic tools have been proposed, including tumour -pyruvate kinase (tM2-PK). To determine whether tM2-PK quantification may have a role in diverse settings we have assessed the assay in a cohort of patients derived from both the England bowel  screening programme (BCSP) and symptomatic individuals presenting to secondary care.Patients undergoing colonoscopy provided faecal samples prior to bowel preparation. Faecal tM2-PK concentrations were measured by ELISA. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and ROC analyses were calculated.Ninety-six patients returned faecal samples: 50 of these with adenomas and 7 with . Median age was 68. Median faecal tM2-PK concentration was 3.8 U/mL for individuals without neoplastic findings at colonoscopy, 7.7 U/mL in those with adenomas and 24.4 U/mL in subjects with colorectal  (both, p=0.01). ROC analysis demonstrated an AUROC of 0.66 (sensitivity 72.4%, specificity 48.7%, positive predictive value 67.7%, negative predictive value 36.7%).

We and others have shown that TRIM33 is involved in the innate immune response and in the inflammatory response but TRIM33 role in intestinal inflammation is not known. In this study, we investigated the role of TRIM33 in myeloid cells during dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis.We study the role of TRIM33 during DSS-induced colitis which mimics intestinal inflammation using mice deleted for Trim33 only in mature myeloid cells (Trim33 mice) FINDINGS: We first show that Trim33 mRNA level is decreased in CD patient's blood monocytes suggesting a role of TRIM33 in CD. Using Trim33 mice, we show that these mice display an impaired resolution of  inflammation with an increased number of blood and  monocytes and a decreased number of  macrophages. Trim33 monocytes are less competent for recruitment and macrophage differentiation. Finally, during resolution of inflammation, Trim33  macrophages display an impaired M1/ switch and express a low level of membrane-bound TNF that is associated with an increased number of  neutrophils.Our study shows an important role of TRIM33 in monocytes/macrophages during DSS-induced colitis and suggests that the decreased expression of TRIM33 in CD patient's blood monocytes might not be a consequence but might be involved in CD progression.

Results from xenograft mouse models suggested that L1CAM antibodies might be promising tools for  therapy. Here, we generated human L1CAM-transgenic mice to study therapeutic efficacy and putative side effects in a model system. We established three transgenic lines (, M3 and F4) expressing the human L1CAM transgene in brain, kidney and  with decreasing intensity (, M3 > F4). The expression pattern was similar to that of L1CAM in humans. No interference of the transgene with the expression of endogenous L1CAM was observed. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed correct expression of the transgene in mouse cortex and collective duct of the kidney. Injection of (125)I-labeled L1CAM antibodies resulted in specific enrichment in the kidney but not in the brain. The injection of the therapeutic anti-human L1CAM mAb L1-9.3/2a into transgenic mice even at high doses did not cause behavioral changes or other side effects. Similar results were obtained using a mouse specific L1CAM mAb in normal mice. Tumor therapy experiments were performed using syngeneic mouse tumor cells (RET melanoma and Panc02 pancreatic adenocarcinoma) transduced with human L1CAM. MAb L1-9.3/2a efficiently and specifically attenuated local tumor growth in both model systems without apparent side effects. The therapeutic effect was dependent on immune effector mechanisms. Analysis of Panc02-huL1CAM tumors after therapy showed elevated levels of EGF and evidence of immune-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The results suggest that our transgenic mice are valuable tools to study L1CAM-based antibody therapy.© 2014 UICC.</p></html>
