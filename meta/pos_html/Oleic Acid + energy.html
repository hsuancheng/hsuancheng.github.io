Mushrooms are widely used as healthy nutritious food. In the present study, the nutritional composition of four different Pleurotus sp. was determined. Prior to extraction, all the selected mushrooms were subjected for proximate composition analysis. The protein, fat, ash, total carbohydrate, fiber and  contents were in the range of (16.07- 25.15%), (0.64-2.02%), (2.1-9.14%), (65.66-82.47%), (6.21-54.12%) and (342.20-394.30Kcal/100g), respectively. The spectrophotometric analysis showed that the concentration of protein was in the range of 45.78-33.47 mg/g in all Pleurotus sp. High performance liquid chromatographic analysis of sugars showed six different mono and disaccharides in all the selected mushrooms. The fatty  profile by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that the main fatty acids in selected mushrooms were present in the order linoliec > > palmitic . The results suggested that all the Pleurotus sp. could be considered as a rich source of nutrients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31475703>Benefits of blended oil consumption over other sources of lipids on the cardiovascular system in obese rats.</a></h2><p>High consumption of cooking oils in modern society is believed to be the major cause of cardiovascular disease. The effect of cooking oils depends on their fatty  composition. Therefore, it is important to blend different types of oils to improve functional properties. In this study we evaluated the effects of a functional blended oil (BO) composed of a high level of  (OA) (50.93%) and α-linolenic  (ALA) (5.41%) on cardiovascular health, blood pressure (BP) and body weight (BW) in comparison with lard oil (LO) and peanut oil (PO). Ninety male Wistar rats were divided into three groups and fed for 12 weeks with BO, LO and PO. Each group was divided into low, middle and high fat groups and fed with oil supply ratios of 6.7%, 10.9% and 48.1%, respectively. After the feeding period, the rats were sacrificed, and data were collected and analyzed. Rats treated with BO especially at a high dose (HBO) showed a significantly lower body weight, fat weight, liver weight, fat ratio, food intake and  intake. BO significantly reduced n-6/n-3 levels in plasma, liver and adipose tissues as well as serum triglycerides (TGs) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) but contrarily increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Furthermore, HBO treatments decreased mRNA expression of lipid anabolism-related genes, lipid inflammatory-related genes, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and increased lipid catabolism-related genes as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma mRNA (PPARγ mRNA). In terms of antioxidant enzymes, BO treatment has increased the activity of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) by lowering malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tissues. Moreover, BO supplementation showed a significant lowering effect on the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), blood pressure (BP), atherosclerosis index (AI) and heart rate (HR). These findings highlight that the new blend of canola oil, corn oil, olive oil, peanut oil and sunflower oil with a low n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio of 6 : 1 could prevent and control cardiovascular disease (CVD).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28749653>Measurement and Surface Complexation Modeling of U(VI) Adsorption to Engineered Iron Oxide Nanoparticles.</a></h2><p>Surface-functionalized magnetite nanoparticles have high capacity for U(VI) adsorption and can be easily separated from the aqueous phase by applying a magnetic field. A surface-engineered bilayer structure enables the stabilization of nanoparticles in aqueous solution. Functional groups in stearic  (SA),  (OA), and octadecylphosphonic  (ODP) coatings led to different adsorption extents (SA≈ OA > ODP) under the same conditions. The impact of water chemistry (initial loading of U(VI), pH, and the presence of carbonate) has been systematically examined for U(VI) adsorption to OA-coated nanoparticles. A diffuse double layer surface complexation model was developed for surface-functionalized magnetite nanoparticles that could simulate both the measured surface charge and the U(VI) adsorption behavior at the same time. With a small set of adsorption reactions for uranyl hydroxide and uranyl carbonate complexes to surface sites, the model can successfully simulate the entire adsorption data set over all uranium loadings, pH values, and dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations. The results show that the adsorption behavior was related to the changing U(VI) species and properties of surface coatings on nanoparticles. The model could also fit pH-dependent surface potential values that are consistent with measured zeta potentials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30991133>The roles of short and long chain fatty acids on physicochemical properties and improved cancer targeting of albumin-based fattigation-platform nanoparticles containing doxorubicin.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of different chain length fatty acids on physicochemical properties and cancer targeting of fattigation-platform nanoparticles (NPs). Two different types of fatty acids (short chain, 2-hydroxybutyric , C4; long chain, , C18:1) were successfully conjugated to human serum albumin (HSA) via simple 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) coupling reaction. These conjugates readily formed HSA-C4 and HSA-C18:1 NPs which showed good stability in serum and desirable biocompatibility with normal cell line (HEK293T). Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) was efficiently loaded into NPs by incubation process via electrostatic interaction. The structure, morphology, and texture of DOX-loaded NPs were characterized by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) equipped with -dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The initial burst release of DOX-loaded NPs was controlled by the presence and chain length of fatty acids. In vitro cytotoxicity studies with three cancer cell lines (A549, HT-29, and PANC-1) suggested that fattigation-platform NPs have distinctive cytotoxic effects compared to Doxil. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry exhibited that the cellular uptake of DOX-loaded NPs was varied by the different chain lengths of fatty acids. It was evident that the chain length of fatty acids in the fattigation-platform NPs could play a vital role in varying physicochemical properties and cancer cell targeting of NPs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The spinel structure formation was confirmed by X-ray diffraction,electron diffraction, infrared, Raman shift measurements. Infrared analysis shows  coating on the surface of nanoparticles and TGA analysis shows that  desorbs from nanoparticle by decomposition at around 400°C. UV-Vis-NIR spectra show all the compounds show  band gap in the semiconductor range (≈ 1.9eV). All compounds show superparamagnetic characteristics at room temperature with enhanced saturated mass magnetization (M) with Zn concentration up to x=0.5 and then reduces with further enhance of x up to 0.8. The M changes were ascribed to occupation of Zn at tetrahedral sites and proportional enhance of Fe at octahedral sites. The enhanced Fe concentration at octahedral sublattice leads to formation Fe-O-Fe networks which favor antiferromagnetic interactions due to superexchange phenomenon. Photocatalytic activity of all compounds were studied through methylene blue (MB) degradation analysis. All compounds show ≈ 96% degradation of MB upon 70min irradiation of light on photoreactor vessel. In addition, photocatalytic activity (degradation efficiency) enhances with Zn concentration in MgFeO. The Zn substitution enhances both M and photocatalytic activity biocompatible of MgFeO nanoparticles.Copyright © 2017.

Insulin, condition of normolipemia and formation of hyper lipoproteinemia type IIb, IV and V].</a></h2><p>According to phylogenetic theory of general pathology, when living in ocean all were carnivorous (piscivorous) fatty acids transferring to cells in form of non-polar triglycerides nitially began apoB-48 chylomicrons, continued lipoproteins of very low and low density and fnalized its apoB-100 endocytosis. The fatty acids are transferred by chylomicrons + lipoproteins of very low density + lipoproteins of low density and non-polar triglycerides are hydrolyzed by hepatic glycerolhydrogenase and co-enzyme apoC-III; according WHO classifcation, hyperlipoproteinemia corresponds to type V. On land, in herbivorous who are not yet synthesized insulin, apoB-48 and chylomicrons left process of non-polar triglycerides transferring. In lipoproteins of very low density and lipoproteins of low density, the carnivorous transfer exogenous palmitic non-polar triglycerides. The herbivorous also transfer palmitic non-polar triglycerides though synthesized by hepatocytes from glucose endogenically. In herbivorous, transferring of palmitic non-polar triglycerides prior to synthesis of insulin is forming apoB-100 in composition of lipoproteins of very low density and lipoproteins of low density. The hydrolysis of palmitic non-polar triglycerides in lipoproteins of very low density is activated by hepatic glycerol hydrogenase and apoC-III; cells absorb lipoproteins of low density by means of apoB-100 endocytosis. The content on lipoproteins in blood plasma under electrophoresis of lipoproteins corresponds to hepatic glycerol hydrogenase type IIb. In frst and second types of fatty acids transferring in form of triglycerides to lipoproteins of very low density + lipoproteins of low density predominate palmitic fatty , triglycerides of the same name and palmitic metabolism of fatty acids in vivo. The insulin initiated the third type of transferring of  fatty  by now to insulin-depended cells only in  lipoproteins of very low density; hydrolysis of  triglycerides is activated by late in phylogenesis post-heparin hepatic glycerol hydrogenase and apoC-II cofactor. The dynamic apoE is actively bound by apoB-100 forming apoE/B-100 ligand. At later stages of phylogenesis insulin formed fatty acids transferring in form of  triglycerides in lipoproteins of very low density of the same name without forming of  lipoproteins of low density; the electrophoregram of lipoproteins reﬂects absence of hepatic glycerol hydrogenase. In phylogenesis three types of fatty acids transferring to triglycerides in composition of lipoproteins formed sequentially: 1) chylomicrons + lipoproteins of very low and density + lipoproteins of low density; 2) lipoproteins of very low density + lipoproteins of low density; 3) only in lipoproteins of very low density. The frst one is specifc to piscivorous (carnivorous) while living in ocean. The second one is implemented by herbivorous while they didn't begin to synthesize insulin and hepatocytes not yet transform all endogenous palmitic fatty  into  fatty . Insulin initiated: a) transferring of  fatty acids to lipoproteins of very low density without forming  lipoproteins of low density; b) highly effective  metabolism of fatty acids in vivo: c) becoming of biological function of locomotion. The aphysiological induction by substrate, surplus of palmitic fatty acids in food initiate negative alterations in composition of lipoproteins in opposite direction than in case of phylogenesis. When homo sapiens, herbivorous in phylogenesis, begins to misuse carnivorous (meat) food then instead of normolipoproteinemia in blood plasma under electrophoresis of lipoproteins one can initially detect transitory hyperlipoproteinemia type IV and then prolonged hyperlipoproteinemia type IIb. If patient factually passes on to carnivorous diet then hyperlipoproteinemia type V is developing. If content of exogenous palmitic fatty  in food surpasses physiological capacities of its transferring in  triglycerides as palmitoyl-oleyl-palmitate glycerol, palmitic triglycerides as oleyl-palmitoyl-palmitate glycerol begin to form and epigenetically aphysiological non-ligand palmitic lipoproteins of very low density → lipoproteins of low density are formed. Their circulation in blood is a cause of hypertriglyceridemia, higher level of cholesterol-lipoproteins of low density, compensatory increasing of apoC-III. Then occurs induced by substrate formation of hyperlipoproteinemia initially of type IV, then of type IIb and fnally of type V. The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and atheromotosis is activated when homo sapiens, herbivorous in phylogenesis, begin to misuse carnivorous food affecting biological functions of trophology, reaction of exotrophy (external nutrition), function of homeostasis, endoecology and function of adaptation. The formation of palmitic metabolism if fatty acids instead of  one is a cause of chronic defciency of  and ATP synthesis in vivo. Insulin activates absorption of glucose by cells with purpose to use it for synthesis of  fatty acids. In the frst place, insulin regulates in vivo metabolism of fatty acids and only in second place metabolism of glucose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30054773>Fresh and stored copra meal in meat quail diets.</a></h2><p>The aim of the current study was to evaluate the addition of fresh and stored copra meal to the diet of meat quails. Two hundred eighty-seven-day-old male and female quails were distributed in a completely randomized design, with five treatments, in a 2 × 2 + 1factorial arrangement. Two copra meal types (fresh and stored) at inclusion levels of 12.5% and 25%, respectively, were added to a corn-soybean meal-based diet, with seven replicates, of eight quails each. Copra meal acidity index recorded  percentage increase from 0.47 to 3.03% after six storage months. However, regardless of storage type, its addition to quails' diet resulted in higher values of metabolizable , in lower feed intake and better feed conversion than corn-soybean meal diet. Copra meal addition to quails' diet did not affect carcass traits, liver and pancreas relative weight, and bone growth and quality. Although copra meal storage for 180 days resulted in higher free fatty  content in the provided feed, it can be used fresh or after storage, in diet of meat quails from 7 to 42 days of age up to 25%.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29330461>Comparing olive oil and C4-dietary oil, a prodrug for the GPR119 agonist, 2-oleoyl glycerol, less  intake of the latter is needed to stimulate incretin hormone secretion in overweight subjects with type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>After digestion, dietary triacylglycerol stimulates incretin release in humans, mainly through generation of 2-monoacylglycerol, an agonist for the intestinal G protein-coupled receptor 119 (GPR119). Enhanced incretin release may have beneficial metabolic effects. However, dietary fat may promote weight gain and should therefore be restricted in obesity. We designed C4-dietary oil (1,3-di-butyryl-2-oleoyl glycerol) as a 2-oleoyl glycerol (2-OG)-generating fat type, which would stimulate incretin release to the same extent while providing less calories than equimolar amounts of common triglycerides, e.g., olive oil.We studied the effect over 180 min of (a) 19 g olive oil plus 200 g carrot, (b) 10.7 g C4 dietary oil plus 200 g carrot and (c) 200 g carrot, respectively, on plasma responses of gut and pancreatic hormones in 13 overweight patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Theoretically, both oil meals result in formation of 7.7 g 2-OG during digestion.Both olive oil and C4-dietary oil resulted in greater postprandial (P ≤ 0.01) glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) responses (incremental area under curve (iAUC)): iAUC: 645 ± 194 and 702 ± 97 pM × min; iAUC: 4,338 ± 764 and 2,894 ± 601 pM × min) compared to the carrot meal (iAUC: 7 ± 103 pM × min; iAUC: 266 ± 234 pM × min). iAUC for GLP-1 and GIP were similar for C4-dietary oil and olive oil, although olive oil resulted in a higher peak value for GIP than C4-dietary oil.C4-dietary oil enhanced secretion of GLP-1 and GIP to almost the same extent as olive oil, in spite of liberation of both 2-OG and , which also may stimulate incretin secretion, from olive oil. Thus, C4-dietary oil is more effective as incretin releaser than olive oil per unit of  and may be useful for dietary intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30066703>Regular patterns of the effects of hydrogen-containing additives on the formation of CdSe monomer.</a></h2><p>It is unclear at the molecular level why HY (HY = RSH, or ROH, or RNH2) with HPPh2 additives kinetically affects the reaction pathway to the formation of different monomers (Ph2P-SeCd-Y or Ph2P-SeCdSe-Y) in the systhesis of semiconductor nanocrystals. In the present work, it was found that in a [Cd(OA)2 + Se[double bond, length as m-dash]P(C8H17)3 + HPPh2 + HY] mixture, HY behaves as a mediator for the formation of the initial kind of monomer, besides as a hydrogen/proton donor in the release of  and as an accelerant in the Se-P bond cleavage, which follows the mechanism of hydrogen-shift/nucleophilic-attack. The capability of the HY additive to provide a H-source decreases in the order SePPh2H > RSH > HPPh2 > ROH > RNH2, while the performance of HY to accelerate Se-P bond cleavage decreases in the order HPPh2 > RSH > RNH2 > ROH. The capacity of HY to promote the formation of the Ph2P-SeCd-Y monomer decreases in the order RSH > HPPh2 > ROH > RNH2, while the effect of HY to drive the formation of the Ph2P-SeCdSe-Y monomer decreases in the order HPPh2 > RSH > RNH2 > ROH. The activation strain  plays a key role in both the Se-P and H-Y bond cleavage, which correlates negatively to the size of the coordinated atom radius. When only HPPh2 is present without other HY species (HY = RNH2, or RSH, or ROH), Ph2P-SeCdSe-PPh2 is preferentially formed. Alternatively, when both HY (HY = RNH2, or RSH, or ROH) and HPPh2 are present, Ph2P-SeCd-Y is favorably formed. For the formation of Ph2P-SeCd-Y (Y = -PPh2, -SR, -OR, and -NHR), SePPh2H embodies the catalytic performance, while HPPh2 serves as the catalyst for the formation of Ph2P-SeCdSe-Y (Y = -NHR or -OR). Our study brings a molecular-level insight into the relationship between the CdSe monomer and the phosphorous-containing side-product, which may advance the rational design and synthesis of quantum dots.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30872120>Involvement of pericardial adipose tissue in cardiac fibrosis of dietary-induced obese minipigs- Role of mitochondrial function.</a></h2><p>Heart is a high  demand organ and cardiac fat is the main local  source for heart. Alteration in cardiac fat may affect cardiac  and contribute to heart dysfunction. We previously observed a link between alteration in pericardial fat (PAT) and local adverse effects on myocardial fibrosis in obese minipigs. This study investigated the role of PAT on cardiac  and mitochondrial function, and elucidated a potential mechanism for PAT in cardiac fibrosis.Five-month-old Lee-Sung minipigs were made obese by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 months. The conditioned medium from PAT of obese minipigs (PAT-CM) was collected and H9C2 cells were treated with it to study mechanisms.HFD caused a cardiac  deficit and fibrosis in the left ventricle. An elevated content of IL6 and malondialdehyde was found in the PAT of obese pigs. Obese pigs exhibited an increased level of  and a reduced level of saturated fatty acids in PAT compared to control pigs. HFD did not alter the metabolic characteristics of epicardial fat. PAT-CM caused apoptosis of H9C2 cells and inhibited basal mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. Protein expressions for mitochondrial dynamics- (Mfn2, Opa1, Drp1, and Fis1) and a mitophagy-related protein (Parkin) were suppressed by PAT-CM. PAT-CM enhanced the protein expression of LC3II, and the ratio of LC3II/LC3I. To conclude, PAT was involved in cardiac fibrosis of HFD-fed minipigs. The secretomes of PAT impaired mitochondrial functions and caused cardiomyocyte apoptosis in a paracrine manner.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In response to fluctuating environmental conditions, the physiological status of bacteria can change due to the actions of transcriptional regulatory machinery. The synthesis and accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are one of the survival strategies in harsh environments. In this study, we used transcriptome analysis of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 to gain a genome-wide view of the mechanisms of environmental-friendly biopolymers accumulation under nitrogen-limiting conditions during conversion of metabolically different carbon sources (sodium gluconate and ). Transcriptomic data revealed that phaG expression is associated with medium-chain-length-PHAs' synthesis not only on sodium gluconate but also on , suggesting that PhaG may play a role in this process, as well. Moreover, genes involved in the β-oxidation pathway were induced in the PHAs production phase when sodium gluconate was supplied as the only carbon and  source. The transition from exponential growth to stationary phase caused a significant expression of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism,  supply, and transport system. In this study, several molecular mechanisms, which drive mcl-PHAs synthesis, have been investigated.

Physicochemical parameters of  MFA has become the standard of an oxidation substrate for in vivo  production; this MFA was synthesized in organisms for millions of years. Environmental influences are the second factor which determines kinetic perfection of biological organisms during phylogenesis. Are these influences always beneficial? Mostly, they are not. However, they largely stimulate adaptive functions of the organism, including the biological function of locomotion, cognitive function and the function of positioning in the environment. Biological,  and kinetic perfection formed in vivo can be easily destroyed if phylogenetically herbivorous Homo sapiens abuses the diet of carnivorous animals (meat) which was not consumed by him and his ancestors during phylogenesis.

Our results indicate that the most effective of our -stabilized K-edge nanoparticles can achieve 2-4x higher contrast than the examined iodinated molecules, making them suitable for deep tissue imaging of tissues or tumors. On the other hand, ligand exchange yielding poly(acrylic )-stabilized K-edge nanoparticles allows for high dispersibility and homogeneity in water, but with a lower contrast due to the high density of the polymer grafted, unless further engineering is probed.

Among a variety of assembly techniques, evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) is one of the prospective approaches because of its simplicity. Although EISA has shown its potential to form highly ordered nanocrystal arrays, the formation of uniform nanocrystal arrays over large areas remains a challenging subject. Here, we introduce a new EISA method and demonstrate the formation of large-scale highly ordered monolayers of barium titanate (BaTiO₃, BT) nanocubes at the air-water interface. In our method, the addition of an extra surfactant to a water surface assists the EISA of BT nanocubes with a size of 15⁻20 nm into a highly ordered arrangement. We reveal that the compression pressure exerted by the extra surfactant on BT nanocubes during the solvent evaporation is a key factor in the self-assembly in our method. The BT nanocube monolayers transferred to substrates have sizes up to the millimeter scale and a high out-of-plane crystal orientation, containing almost no microcracks and voids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28762006>Oleaginous Microalgae from Dairy Farm Wastewater for Biodiesel Production: Isolation, Characterization and Mass Cultivation.</a></h2><p>Producing biodiesel from microalgae grown in wastewater is environment-friendly and cost-effective.

Chaperon-mediated autophagy (CMA) triggers lipid droplets (LDs) breakdown, to initiate lipolysis via either cytosolic lipases or macroautophagy. SIRT3, a mitochondrial NAD-dependent deacetylase, regulates the acetylation status and activity of many substrates involving in  metabolism. However, the role of SIRT3 in regulating lipophagy is controversial. The current study showed that SIRT3 expression was decreased and the macroautophagy flux was blocked in the primary hepatocytes from high-fat diet fed mice and P/O (palmitic  and  mixture) treated AML12 mouse hepatocytes, compared with the corresponding controls. SIRT3 overexpression promoted macroautophagy in LDs from P/O-treated hepatocytes through activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and unc-51-like kinase 1, to boost LDs digestion. Gain of SIRT3 expression stimulated the formation of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP-2A)-heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (HSC70)-perilipin-2 (PLN2) complex, to promote CMA process and reduce the stability of LDs in hepatocytes. Moreover, SIRT3 reduced the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, to suppress lipogenesis. In addition, SIRT3 overexpression promoted LDs dispersion on detyrosinated microtubules, and directly deacetylated long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase to enhance mitochondrial energetics. Taken together, SIRT3 ameliorates lipotoxicity in hepatocytes, which might be a potential target for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31453116>Optimization of enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic fraction obtained from stranded driftwood feedstocks for lipid production by .</a></h2><p>Stranded driftwood feedstocks may represent, after pretreatment with steam explosion and enzymatic hydrolysis, a cheap C-source for producing biochemicals and biofuels using oleaginous yeasts.

In addition, those pikas showed increased levels of lactic , sarcosine, 4-hydroxybutyrate, methionine, tartaric , ribose, tyrosine, pentadecanoic , 2-monoolein, 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, trehalose-6-phosphate, succinic , myoinositol, fumaric , taurine, 2-hydroxybutanoic , gluconic , citrulline, and glutathione, but decreased levels of  and 2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-monophosphate. Metabolic activity is significantly altered in the myocardium of pikas in the high-altitude areas of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This study provides important insights into metabolic biomarkers related to the adaptation of pikas to high-altitude hypoxia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29723825>Rice tolerance to suboptimal low temperatures relies on the maintenance of the photosynthetic capacity.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this research was to identify differences between two contrasting rice cultivars in their response to suboptimal low temperatures stress. A transcriptomic analysis of the seedlings was performed and results were complemented with biochemical and physiological analyses. The microarray analysis showed downregulation of many genes related with PSII and particularly with the oxygen evolving complex in the sensitive cultivar IR50. Complementary studies indicated that the PSII performance, the degree of oxygen evolving complex coupling with the PSII core and net photosynthetic rate diminished in this cultivar in response to the stress. However, the tolerant cultivar Koshihikari was able to maintain its  equilibrium by sustaining the photosynthetic capacity. The increase of  in Koshihikari could be related with membrane remodelling of the chloroplasts and hence contribute to tolerance. Overall, these results work as a ground for future analyses that look forward to characterize possible mechanisms to tolerate this stress.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Among low-input crops, . is a perennial herbaceous rhizomatous grass containing both C5 and C6 carbohydrates. The scope of the present work was to investigate and optimize the production of lipids by the oleaginous yeast  from undetoxified lignocellulosic hydrolysates of steam-pretreated . The growth of  was first optimized in synthetic media, similar in terms of sugar concentration to hydrolysates, by applying the response surface methodology (RSM) analysis. Then the bioconversion of undetoxified hydrolysates was investigated. A fed-batch process for the fermentation of  hydrolysates was finally implemented in a 2-L bioreactor. Under optimized conditions, the total lipid content was 64% of the dry cell weight and the lipid yield was 63% of the theoretical. The fatty  profile of  triglycerides contained 27% palmitic , 33%  and 32% linoleic . These results proved the potential of lipid production from A. donax, which is particularly important for their consideration as substitutes for vegetable oils in many applications such as biodiesel or bioplastics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29886843>Cell Growth, Lipid Production and Productivity in Photosynthetic Microalga Chlorella vulgaris under Different Nitrogen Concentrations and Culture Media Replacement.</a></h2><p>The photosynthetic unicellular microalgal strain, Chlorella vulgaris is considered as a robust biomass and lipid producer for human food and feed and also green  production. The culture media composition plays a crucial role in biomass and lipid production and productivity.The photosynthetic green microalga C. vulgaris was studied in three distinct cultivation experiments each for 22 days, using BG11 and f/2 culture media to investigate the effects of different levels of nitrogen and culture media replacement on cell growth, lipid production and productivity.In f/2 culture medium, the total lipid production reached was 0.246 g L-1 (41.55%) which was 147% higher than its counterpart in BG11 medium (0.298 g L-1). On the other hand, the highest biomass (1.492 g L-1) was attained in BG11-3 medium with 6.00 g nitrate L-1 and this was correlated with higher total chlorophyll content (15.189 mg L-1) and cell number (3.812 × 106 cell mL-1). A fatty  profile, composed of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids was detected and included stearic , , α-linolenic  and γ-linolenic  which have nutritional or combustion importance.These data suggest that this C. vulgaris strain may be considered as a robust source for biomass, lipid and green  production.

In other words, is it better to cut fat or cut carbohydrate for weight loss. However, going beyond this debate (fat versus carbohydrate), are questions around whether certain fatty acids are worse for promoting insulin resistance, inflammation, and obesity. The overall evidence in the literature suggests that medium-chain saturated fats (such as lauric , found in coconut oil) and monounsaturated fat (, found in olive oil) are less likely to promote insulin resistance, inflammation, and fat storage compared to long-chain saturated fatty acids (such as stearic  found in large quantities in butter, but particularly palmitic  found in palm oil) especially when consumed on top of a diet moderate in refined carbohydrates. Compared to long-chain saturated fats, lauric  and  have an increased fatty  oxidation rate, are more likely to be burned for  and less likely to be stored in adipose tissue, and thus promote increased  expenditure. Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as linoleic , as found in vegetable oils may contribute to obesity, whereas omega-3 PUFA may be protective. Importantly, both olive oil as part of a Mediterranean diet, and omega-3 from fish and fish oil have been proven to reduce risk of cardiovascular (CV) events.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29649154>Chemical and Nutritional Composition of Terminalia ferdinandiana (Kakadu Plum) Kernels: A Novel Nutrition Source.</a></h2><p> (Kakadu plum) is a native Australian fruit. Industrial processing of  fruits into puree generates seeds as a by-product, which are generally discarded. The aim of our present study was to process the seed to separate the kernel and determine its nutritional composition. The proximate, mineral and fatty  compositions were analysed in this study. Kernels are composed of 35% fat, while proteins account for 32% dry weight (DW). The  content and fiber were 2065 KJ/100 g and 21.2% DW, respectively. Furthermore, the study showed that kernels were a very rich source of minerals and trace elements, such as potassium (6693 mg/kg), calcium (5385 mg/kg), iron (61 mg/kg) and zinc (60 mg/kg) DW, and had low levels of heavy metals. The fatty  composition of the kernels consisted of omega-6 fatty , linoleic  (50.2%), monounsaturated  (29.3%) and two saturated fatty acids namely palmitic  (12.0%) and stearic  (7.2%).

The new nanosorbent was characterized by Fourier-transform-infrared (FT-IR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and determination of surface area. The NBent-NPA-OA particle size was ranged between 9.45 and 33.60nm according to HR-TEM analysis. The FT-IR exhibited several characteristic absorption peaks due to the existence of deposited layers of nanopolyaniline and  on the surface of nanobentonite surface. Different experimental parameters including, initial pH, contact time, nanosorbent, initial concentration of the target metals and interfering ions were varied, investigated and optimized to evaluate the removal efficiency of the divalent ionic Zn/Co from their solutions by the action of NBent-NPA-OA nanosorbent. The collected batch equilibrium results confirmed the efficiency of newly functionalized NBent-NPA-OA nanosorbent to uptake the divalent ionic Zn/Co from their solutions (10.0mL of 0.01mol/L) with maximum capacity values 2.916 and 1.960mmolg, respectively using 5.0mg nanosorbent, pH 6.0 and 20min contact reaction time. The multistage microcolumn system was successfully implemented to remove the divalent ionic Zn/Co from tap water in addition to their radioisotopes Zn/Co from radioactive wastewater. The current study refers to an excellent recovery and the removal percent of the radioisotopes Zn (96.4) and Co (92.7%) using NBent-NPA-OA nanosorbent.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we studied the relative proportions of FA in a mammal with extreme changes in metabolic rates. Common noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula) switch from energetically demanding long-distance migration at high metabolic rates to regular torpor with extremely low metabolic rates. We found that composition of FA categories differed between adipose tissue types (white adipose tissue (WAT) vs brown adipose tissue (BAT)) and muscle tissue types (skeletal vs heart), but not between sexes. We found  to be the most abundant FA in all studied tissues. Concentrations of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) were not always higher in muscular tissue compared with adipocyte tissue, even though high concentrations of PUFA are considered beneficial for low body temperatures in torpor. In all tissues, we observed a high content in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), possibly to compensate for a low PUFA content in the diet. Ratios of ω6/ω3 were lower in the heart than in skeletal muscles of common noctules. Three FA (palmitic, , and linoleic ) accounted for about 70% of the FA in adipose tissue, which is similar to proportions observed in migrating birds, yet migrating birds generally have a higher PUFA content in muscle and adipose tissues than bats. Bats seem to contrast with other mammals in having a high MUFA content in all tissues. We conclude that FA profiles of bats differ largely from those of most cursorial mammals and instead are-with the exception of MUFA-similar to those of migrating birds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31495626>Altering the ratio of dietary C16:0 and cis-9 C18:1 interacts with production level in dairy cows: Effects on production responses and  partitioning.</a></h2><p>The objective of our study was to evaluate the effects of altering the dietary ratio of palmitic (C16:0) and  (cis-9 C18:1) acids on nutrient digestibility,  partitioning, and production responses of lactating dairy cows. Cows were blocked by milk yield and assigned to 3 groups (12 cows per group) in a main plot: low (45.2 ± 1.7 kg/d), medium (53.0 ± 1.6 kg/d), and high (60.0 ± 1.9 kg/d). Within each production group, a truncated Latin square arrangement of fatty  (FA) treatments was used in 2 consecutive 35-d periods. The FA treatments supplemented at 1.5% of diet dry matter were (1) 80:10 (80% C16:0 + 10% cis-9 C18:1), (2) 73:17 (73% C16:0 + 17% cis-9 C18:1), (3) 66:24 (66% C16:0 + 24% cis-9 C18:1), and (4) 60:30 (60% C16:0 + 30% cis-9 C18:1). Treatment × production group interactions were observed for yields of milk, fat-corrected milk, -corrected milk, milk fat, milk protein, and milk lactose and  partitioned to milk. Increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments reduced fat-corrected milk, -corrected milk, and milk  output in low-producing cows but increased these in high-producing cows. Increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments did not affect milk yield, milk protein yield, and milk lactose yield in low- and medium-producing cows but increased these in high-producing cows. Regardless of production level, there was no effect of treatments on dry matter intake; however, increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments increased body weight change and body condition score change. Increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments increased total FA digestibility due to a linear increase in 16- and 18-carbon FA digestibilities. Interactions between FA treatments and production level were observed for the yield of milk fat and milk FA sources. In low-producing cows, increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments decreased milk fat yield due to a decrease in de novo and mixed milk FA without changes in preformed milk FA. In contrast, in high-producing cows, increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments increased milk fat yield due to an increase in de novo and preformed milk FA. Our results indicate that high-producing dairy cows (averaging 60 kg/d) responded better to a fat supplement containing more cis-9 C18:1, whereas low-producing cows (averaging 45 kg/d) responded better to a supplement containing more C16:0.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Results indicated that the diatom cultures grown at 1 and 5% CO showed higher growth rates (1.14 and 1.29 div day, respectively) and biomass productivities (44 and 48 mgL day) than air grown cultures (with 1.13 div day and 26 mgL day). The increase of CO resulted in higher cell volume and pigment content per cell of T. pseudonana. Interestingly, lipid content doubled when air was enriched with 1-5% CO. Moreover, the analysis of the fatty  composition of T. pseudonana revealed the predominance of monounsaturated acids (palmitoleic-16:1 and -18:1) and a decrease of the saturated myristic -14:0 and polyunsaturated fatty acids under high CO levels.

Eleven healthy males (age: 29 ± 4.5 year; BMI: 26.3 ± 2.1 kg/m ) completed two 7-day study phases during which hormone levels were altered pharmacologically to produce a low sex hormone condition (gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist, aromatase inhibitor, and placebo gel) or a testosterone add-back condition (testosterone gel). Following 7 days of therapy, subjects were administered an inpatient test meal containing 50 μCi of [1- C] . Plasma samples were collected hourly for 5 h to assess postprandial responses.  metabolism (indirect calorimetry) and dietary fat oxidation ( CO in breath) were assessed at 1, 3, 5, 13.5, and 24 h following the test meal. Abdominal and femoral adipose biopsies were taken 24 h after the test meal to determine uptake of the labeled lipid. Postprandial glucose, insulin, free-fatty , and triglyceride responses were not different between conditions (P > 0.05). Whole-body  metabolism was also not different between conditions at any time point (P > 0.05). Dietary fat oxidation trended lower (P = 0.12) and the relative uptake of  C labeled lipid into femoral adipose tissue was greater (P = 0.03) in the low hormone condition. Short-term hormone suppression did not affect  expenditure or postprandial metabolism, but contributed to greater relative storage of dietary fat in the femoral depot.

However, the lagging quantum yields of blue-emitting perovskite NCs have resulted in low efficiency compared to green or red perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs); moreover, the long insulating ligands (such as oleylamine and ) inhibit charge carrier injection. In this study, we demonstrated a facile ligand-mediated post-treatment (LMPT) method for high-quality perovskite NCs with changing optical properties to allow fine-tuning of the target emission wavelength. This method involves the use of a mixed halide ion-pair ligand, di-dodecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide, and chloride, which can induce a reconstruction through a self-anion exchange. Using the LMPT method, the PLQY of the surface-passivated blue-emitting NCs was dramatically enhanced to over 70% within the 485 nm blue emission region and 50% within the 467 nm deep-blue emission region.

Interesterification resulted in a decrease in the concentration of tri-unsaturated and trisaturated TAG and an increase of mono- and di-saturated TAG as observed by reversed-phase HPLC.

Thermal and structural properties of the blends before and after interesterification were assessed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction and polarized light microscopy. fat analysis indicated the absence of any  fatty  in the final interesterified product.

Development of the biological function of locomotion and kinetic parameters of the body.]</a></h2><p>Phylogenetic theory of general pathology draws researchers' attention to the following aspects of the biological effects of insulin. 1. Phylogenetically, in vivo insulin is primarily involved in the metabolism of fatty acids (FA) and only in the second turn in glucose metabolism; regulation of FA metabolism in cells started millions of years earlier than that of glucose metabolism. Phylogenetically late insulin blocks lipolysis only in phylogenetically late insulin-dependent subcutaneous adipocytes but not in phylogenetically early visceral fat cells of the omentum. 2. Biological role of insulin consists in the formation of the biological function of locomotion, i.e., movement arising from contraction of striated myocytes provided with substrates (FA and glucose) for  production as macroergic ATP. 3. Biological destiny of phylogenetically late insulin is transformation of carnivorous (fish-eating) animals living in the ocean into herbivores living on the dry land. 4. Insulin has formed in vivo highly efficient  variant of FA metabolism instead of phylogenetically early less efficient palmitic variant. 5. Biologically, insulin is destined for providing cells with  and perfection of physical activity and kinetic parameters of the organism. According to phylogenetic theory of general pathology and basic principles of endocrinology, clinical cases should be regarded as: 1. rare structurally-related insulindeficient type I diabetes mellitus, 2. rare structurally-related (receptor pathology) hyperinsulinemic type II diabetes mellitus, and 3. a great number of patients with functional disorders in the hormone activity, insulin resistance syndrome, metabolic syndrome and obesity.

This study was aimed to evaluate the quality of pizza made using two different sources of proteins, chickpea (Cicer arietinum) flour and dried carp fish powder (Cyprinus carpio). Analysis indicated nutrients richness specificity of chickpea flour (higher fiber, , iron, zinc, linoleic  and total nonessential amino acids) and dried carp fish powder (higher contents of protein, fats, ash,  and total essential amino acids) complementing wheat flour to enhance nutritional value of pizza. Total plate count and thiobarbituric  were increased (P<0.05) in dried carp fish powder after 45 days of storage, but no Coliform were detected.

Dried carp fish powder increased (P<0.05) contents of protein, ash, fats, zinc and protein digestibility of pizza. Chickpea flour increased iron and zinc contents of the pizza. Water activity (aw) was decreased in fish powder and chickpea pizza. Pizza firmness and gumminess were significantly (p<0.05) increased at every level of protein source, but cohesiveness was decreased with 10% chickpea flour. Pizza chewiness was the same (P>0.05) across the levels of two protein sources.

Most plasma FFA are bound to albumin. Only when FFA dissociate from albumin, do they become biologically active.To measure the first FFAu profiles in human infants and to measure these profiles before and during intravenous administration of the soybean lipid, intralipid (IL).The study population was 16 premature infants, from a parent study of 130 infants with birth weights 500-2000 g and gestational age 23-34 weeks. The infants chosen had plasma samples of ≥120 µL (volume needed for each FFAu profile measurement) in the first day of life. Infants received IL infusions starting in the second day of life at 1 g/kg/day, increasing by 1-g/kg/day daily up to 3 g/kg/day. FFAu profiles were determined during IL infusion when plasma was available. Profiles are the concentrations of the nine most abundant long-chain FFAu and were determined using novel fluorescent probes.Before intralipid infusion unbound myristic  was the dominant FFAu, as high as 78% of the total FFAu (sum of the 9 FFAu). In contrast, unbound linoleic  was 0% in all infants. With increasing infusion of IL to 3 g/kg/day, unbound linoleic increased to 26% of the total FFAu, with unbound , myristic, and linolenic  the second, third and fourth most abundant. The average total FFAu concentration also increased from 4 nM before intralipid to 53 nM at 3 g/kg/day. During IL infusion the FFAu profiles approached the fatty  composition of intralipid at 3 g/kg/day.This first study of FFAu profiles in neonates revealed that before IL infusion unbound linoleic  was zero in all 16 infants and levels of myristic  were exceptionally large, as much as 78% of the total FFAu profile. These results suggest important and previously unrecognized roles of lipid metabolism in early development. Zero unbound linoleic  before IL infusion may help promote closure of the ductus arteriosus but after IL infusion, synthesis of arachidonic from linoleic  may tend to promote patency. The high levels of unbound myristate may be needed for immediate neonatal  needs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31274279>Chemiluminescence of  Capped Black Phosphorus Quantum Dots for Highly Selective Detection of Sulfite in PM.</a></h2><p>Quantum dots (QDs), especially metal-free QDs with their unique optoelectronic properties, environmental friendliness, and excellent biocompatibility, have opened a new avenue to explore novel chemiluminescence (CL) systems for analytical applications. However, the unknown CL properties, relatively weak emission, and instability of some of them in water (e.g., black phosphorus QDs) often seriously hinder their further practical applications. Chemical modification trends have offered new properties for materials and have been proved to be desirable ways to establish sensing platforms with improved sensitivity and stability. Herein,  capped black phosphorus QDs (OA-BP QDs) with improved stability and optical properties were successfully synthesized. More importantly, an extraordinary CL emission when OA-BP QDs reacted with SO was first observed. In the CL process, OA-BP QDs acted as the catalyst to trigger singlet oxygen (O) generation in NaHSO, and then a chemiluminescence resonance  transfer (CRET) between (O)* (O dimeric aggregate) and OA-BP QDs was produced. On this basis, a new CL system for directly monitoring SO in airborne fine particulate matter (PM) was fabricated.

It plays an important role in protein synthesis and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Chromium is found in trivalent Cr(III) and hexavalent Cr(VI) form; Cr(III) is relatively stable and intimately participates with many phenomena of metabolisms. Whereas, Cr(VI) is toxic, which results in growth inhibition and leading to changes in components of antioxidant systems as well as secondary metabolites. However, the molecular mechanism that is involved in Cr (VI)-induced hepatotoxicity is still unclear. For this purpose, 40 chickens were randomly assigned into two groups: the normal group (feeding the basic diet and clear water), the chromium group (16%LD, 74.24 mg/kg/day KCrO ). The samples were subjected to pathological examination and UHPLC-QE-MS non-target metabolomics method for metabolomics analysis of broiler liver using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The central venous cells of the broiler liver in the chromium poisoning group showed turbidity and flaky necrosis, nuclear condensation, nuclear rupture, and even nuclear dissolution. The differential metabolite analysis between the chromium poisoning and the control group showed that 32 differential metabolites were upregulated and 15 were downregulated in positive ion mode. Whereas,17 differential metabolites were downregulated, and 35 were downregulated in negative ion mode (P ≤ 0.05).

By combining a high speed photoconductive switch with an ultrafast laser excitation in a sub-40 ps photoconductor, we observed transient photocurrents with peak densities of 3 × 10 - 10 mA/ in self-assembled PbSe nanocrystals capped with long native  ligands. The ratio between the transient photocurrent peak and the steady-state dark current is 10 orders of magnitude. The transient mobility at the peak current is estimated to range between 0.5-17.5 cm/(V s) for the various nanocrystal sizes studied, which is 6 to 9 orders of magnitude higher than the dark current steady-state mobility in PbSe, CdSe, and CdTe nanocrystals capped with native ligands. The results are analyzed using a kinetic model which attributes the ultrahigh transient photocurrent to multiple photogenerated excitons undergoing on-particle Auger recombination, followed by rapid tunneling at high energies. This mechanism is demonstrated for a wide range of PbSe nanocrystals sizes (diameters from 2.7 to 7.1 nm) and experimental parameters. Our observations indicate that native ligand-capped nanocrystal arrays are promising for optoelectronics applications wherein multiple carriers are photoinjected to interband states.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30261617>The Acute Effect of - or Linoleic -Containing Meals on Appetite and Metabolic Markers; A Pilot Study in Overweight or Obese Individuals.</a></h2><p>Despite the abundance of plant-derived fats in our diet, their effects on appetite, and metabolic markers, remain unclear. This single-blinded 3-way cross-over pilot study aimed to investigate the ability of the two most abundant dietary plant-derived fats,  (OA) and linoleic (LA) acids, to modulate postprandial appetite and levels of circulating appetite and metabolic regulators in overweight/obese individuals. Meals were a high-carbohydrate control, a high-OA or a high-LA meal, and provided 30% of participants' estimated  requirements. Meals were consumed after an overnight fast, with blood samples collected over 3¼ h. Appetite parameters were assessed via a validated visual analogue scale questionnaire. Hormones and other circulating factors were quantified using multiplex immunoassays. Eight participants (age 45.8 ± 3.6 (years), body mass index 32.0 ± 1.3 (kg/m²)) completed the study. All meals significantly increased fullness and reduced desire to eat. The control and high-OA meals significantly decreased prospective food intake. The high-LA meal increased ghrelin levels ( < 0.05), a hormone which encourages food intake. This was coupled with a significant acute increase in resistin levels, which impairs insulin signaling. Taken together, this study indicates that in overweight/obese individuals, high-LA meals may promote excess  intake and alter glucose handling, though a larger cohort may be required to strengthen results.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30629473>Effect of frequent interruptions of sedentary time on nutrient metabolism in sedentary overweight male and female adults.</a></h2><p>This study compared 24-h nutrient oxidation responses between a sedentary condition (SED) and a condition in which short 5-min bouts of moderate-intensity physical activity were performed hourly for nine consecutive hours over 4 days (MICRO). To determine whether any shifts in fuel use were due solely to increases in  expenditure, we also studied a condition consisting of a single isoenergetic 45-min bout of moderate-intensity exercise (ONE). Twenty sedentary overweight or obese adults (10 men/10 women; 32.4 ± 6.3 yr; BMI, 30.6 ± 2.9 kg/m) completed all three conditions (MICRO, SED, and ONE) in a randomized order. Each condition consisted of a 3-day free-living run-in followed by a 24-h stay in a whole-room calorimeter to measure total  expenditure (TEE) and substrate utilization. Dietary fat oxidation was also assessed during the chamber stay by administering a [1-C]  tracer at breakfast.  intake was matched across conditions. Both MICRO and ONE increased TEE relative to SED, resulting in a negative  balance. HOMA-IR improved in both activity conditions. MICRO increased 24-h carbohydrate oxidation compared with both ONE and SED ( P < 0.01 for both). ONE was associated with higher 24-h total fat oxidation compared with SED, and higher 24-h dietary fat oxidation compared with both SED and MICRO. Differences in substrate oxidation remained significant after adjusting for  balance. In overweight and obese men and women, breaking up sitting time increased reliance upon carbohydrate as fuel over 24 h, while a single -matched continuous bout of exercise preferentially relies upon fat over 24 h. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Insulin sensitivity, as assessed by HOMA-IR, was improved after 4 days of physical activity, independent of frequency and duration of activity bouts. Temporal patterns of activity across the day differentially affect substrate oxidation. Frequent interruptions of sedentary time with short bouts of walking primarily increase 24-h carbohydrate oxidation, whereas an -matched single continuous bout of moderate intensity walking primarily increased 24-h fat oxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31276903>Effects of algae supplementation in high- dietary on fatty  composition and the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism in Hu sheep managed under intensive finishing system.</a></h2><p>This study aims to investigate the effect of algae supplementation in high- diet (HE diet) on lipid metabolism of intensive feeding sheep. The lambs were assigned to two groups and received a standard diet (ST diet, 8.40 MJ/kg) or a HE diet (9.70 MJ/kg) based on corn, wheat bran, soybean meal. Each group was divided into two subgroups: control and algae supplement (3%, DM basis). The body fat, serum cholesterol, and  in the liver and muscle increased in lambs receiving the HE diet. However, after supplementing the microalgae (Schizochytrium sp.) in the HE diet, these parameters were all reduced. In addition, EPA, DHA and CLA cis-9, trans-11 in muscle and liver increased. Algae supplementation also altered the expression of lipid metabolism-related genes, including up-regulated FADS2, ELOVL2, SCD, CPT1α and SREBF-1, and down-regulated PPARα and PPARγ. In conclusion, algae supplementation in ST and HE diets increased n-3PUFA and improved metabolic disorder caused by the HE diet.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The expression of genes was detected by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. Lipid droplets in the cells and tissues were stained with Oil Red O.PJ34 treatment aggravated -induced lipid accumulation in hepatoma cells and induced SREBP1 expression by modulating the modification of transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1). The high-fat diet-mice exhibited hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and lipid accumulation after 3 months of feeding. Although the serum level of lipid was not altered after PJ34 treatment, the expression level of lipogenic gene was up-regulated and the lipid accumulation was increased in the liver tissues of high-fat diet + PJ34-treated mice. In the high-fat diet + PJ34-treated mice, the insulin sensitivity was slightly changed and the levels of blood glucose and serum insulin were decreased compared with the mice fed with a high-fat diet alone.Taken together, PARP inhibition up-regulated the expression level of lipogenic gene and significantly induced lipid accumulation in the liver, which might worsen lipid metabolism disorders. These data will guide future research into the application of PARP inhibitors in the management of metabolic diseases.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

This severe GRMD phenotype includes moderate atrophy of the biceps femoris (BF) as compared to unaffected normal dogs, while the long digital extensor (LDE), which functions to flex the tibiotarsal joint and serves as a digital extensor, undergoes the most pronounced atrophy. A recent microarray analysis of GRMD identified alterations in genes associated with lipid metabolism and  production.We, therefore, undertook a non-targeted metabolomics analysis of the milder/earlier stage disease GRMD BF muscle versus the more severe/chronic LDE using GC-MS to identify underlying metabolic defects specific for affected GRMD skeletal muscle.Untargeted metabolomics analysis of moderately-affected GRMD muscle (BF) identified eight significantly altered metabolites, including significantly decreased stearamide (0.23-fold of controls, p = 2.89 × 10), carnosine (0.40-fold of controls, p = 1.88 × 10), fumaric  (0.40-fold of controls, p = 7.40 × 10), lactamide (0.33-fold of controls, p = 4.84 × 10), myoinositol-2-phosphate (0.45-fold of controls, p = 3.66 × 10), and significantly increased  (1.77-fold of controls, p = 9.27 × 10), glutamic  (2.48-fold of controls, p = 2.63 × 10), and proline (1.73-fold of controls, p = 3.01 × 10). Pathway enrichment analysis identified significant enrichment for arginine/proline metabolism (p = 5.88 × 10, FDR 4.7 × 10), where alterations in L-glutamic , proline, and carnosine were found. Additionally, multiple Krebs cycle intermediates were significantly decreased (e.g., malic , fumaric , citric/isocitric , and succinic ), suggesting that altered  metabolism may be underlying the observed GRMD BF muscle dysfunction. In contrast, two pathways, inosine-5'-monophosphate (VIP Score 3.91) and 3-phosphoglyceric  (VIP Score 3.08) mainly contributed to the LDE signature, with two metabolites (phosphoglyceric  and inosine-5'-monophosphate) being significantly decreased. When the BF and LDE were compared,  the most significant metabolite was phosphoric , which was significantly less in the GRMD BF compared to control and GRMD LDE groups.The identification of elevated BF  (a long-chain fatty ) is consistent with recent microarray studies identifying altered lipid metabolism genes, while alterations in arginine and proline metabolism are consistent with recent studies identifying elevated L-arginine in DMD patient sera as a biomarker of disease. Together, these studies demonstrate muscle-specific alterations in GRMD-affected muscle, which illustrate previously unidentified metabolic changes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772307>Nitro-fatty acids protect against steatosis and fibrosis during development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and resulting nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are reaching global epidemic proportions. Lack of non-invasive diagnostic tools and effective therapies constitute two of the major hurdles for a bona fide treatment and a reversal of NASH progression and/or regression of the disease. Nitro- (OA-NO) has been proven effective in multiple experimental models of inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, the potential benefit of in vivo administration of OA-NO to treat advanced NAFLD was tested herein in a model of long-term NASH diet-induced liver damage.Non-invasive imaging (e.g. photoacustic-ultrasound (PA-US)) was pursued to establish advanced experimental model of NASH in mice in which both steatosis and fibrosis were diagnosed prior experimental therapy with OA-NO. Experimental controls included equimolar amounts of the non-nitrated  (OA). CLAMS and NMR-based analysis was used for  metabolism.CLAMS and NMR-based analysis demonstrates that OA-NO improves body composition and  metabolism and inhibits hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Photoacoustic-ultrasound imaging revealed a robust inhibition of liver steatosis and fibrosis by OA-NO. RNA-sequencing analysis uncovered inflammation and fibrosis as major pathways suppressed by OA-NO administration, as well as regulation of lipogenesis and lipolysis pathways, with a robust inhibition of SREBP1 proteolytic activation and subsequent lipogenesis gene expression by OA-NO. These results were further supported by histological analysis and quantification of lipid accumulation, lobular inflammation (F4/80 staining) and fibrosis (collagen deposition, αSMA staining) as well as established parameters of liver damage (ALT). In vitro studies indicate that OA-NO inhibits TG biosynthesis and accumulation in hepatocytes and inhibits fibrogenesis in human stellate cells.OA-NO improve steatohepatitis and fibrosis and may constitute an effective therapeutic approach against advanced NAFLD that warrants further clinical evaluation.Copyright © 2019.

The objective of this study was to compare the effects of the free fatty   (OA) and the triglyceride olive oil (OO) on gastrointestinal motility, gut hormone secretion, and  intake in older and middle-aged healthy volunteers. In a double-blind, randomized, cross-over, study 10 older (age 83.0 ± 3.4 (mean ± SD) years) and 10 middle-aged (age 43.1 ± 8.9 years) men were examined on two occasions to evaluate the effect of isocaloric and isovolaemic loads of radiolabelled OA or OO on gastric emptying, oro-caecal transit, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) secretions, and  intake. Gastric emptying was slower in older than in middle-aged men (lipid p < 0.001, water p = 0.010), while no difference between these groups was found for oro-caecal transit. In comparison with OO, OA caused slower gastric emptying (lipid p < 0.001, water p = 0.020) and faster oro-caecal transit (p = 0.025). Postprandial secretion of GLP-1 and PYY was comparable for older and middle-aged men, as well as for OA and OO. Older men ingested less  than middle-aged men did (p < 0.001) and their  intake was lower after OA than OO (p = 0.002). Thus, gastric emptying of an oral lipid load is slower in older than in middle-aged men; gastric emptying is slower and oro-caecal transit faster after OA than OO in both age groups; and older men ingest less  than middle-aged men and less  after OA than OO.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The objectives of this study were to explore the effects of LNPs on adiposity and the mechanisms involved, and to evaluate their impact on metabolic homeostasis.Young Zucker fa/fa rats were treated with LNP599 (10 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. Effects on body weight, adiposity (regional re-distribution, morphology, and function of adipose tissues), cardiovascular and metabolic homeostasis, and liver function were evaluated. Direct effects on insulin and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling were studied in human hepatoma HepG2 cells.LNP599 treatment limited the age-dependent remodeling and inflammation of subcutaneous, epididymal, and visceral adipose tissues, and prevented total fat deposits and the development of obesity. Body-weight stabilization was not related to reduced food intake but rather to enhanced  expenditure and thermogenesis. Cardiovascular and metabolic parameters were also improved and were significantly correlated with body weight but not with plasma norepinephrine. Insulin and AMPK signaling were enhanced in hepatic tissues of treated animals, whereas blood markers of hepatic disease and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were reduced. In cultured HepG2 cells, LNP ligands phosphorylated AMPK and the downstream acetyl-CoA carboxylase and prevented -induced intracellular lipid accumulation. They also significantly potentiated insulin-mediated AKT activation and this was independent from AMPK.Selective I imidazoline receptor agonists protect against the development of adiposity and obesity, and the associated cardio-metabolic disorders. Activation of I receptors in the liver, leading to stimulation of the cellular  sensor AMPK and insulin sensitization, and in adipose tissues, leading to improvement of morphology and function, are identified as peripheral mechanisms involved in the beneficial actions of these ligands.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31287481>Hybrid light emitting diodes based on stable, high brightness all-inorganic CsPbI perovskite nanocrystals and InGaN.</a></h2><p>Despite important advances in the synthesis of inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (NCs), the long-term instability and degradation of their quantum yield (QY) over time need to be addressed to enable the further development and exploitation of these nanomaterials. Here we report stable CsPbI perovskite NCs and their use in hybrid light emitting diodes (LEDs), which combine in one system the NCs and a blue GaN-based LED. Nanocrystals with improved morphological and optical properties are obtained by optimizing the post-synthesis replacement of  ligands with iminodibenzoic : the NCs have a long shelf-life (>2 months), stability under different environmental conditions, and a high QY, of up to 90%, in the visible spectral range. Ligand replacement enables the engineering of the morphological and optical properties of the NCs. Furthermore, the NCs can be used to coat the surface of a GaN-LED to realize a stable diode where they are excited by blue light from the LED under low current injection conditions, resulting in emissions at distinct wavelengths in the visible range.

Conjugated fatty acids (CFA), namely isomers of linoleic and linolenic  (i.e. CLA and CLNA, respectively) can positively modulate inflammation processes and  metabolism, promoting anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant effects, improved lipid profiles and insulin resistance, among others. Bioactive doses have been indicated to be above 1 g/d, yet these cannot be achieved through a moderate intake (i.e. 1-2 servings) of natural sources, and certain CLA-containing products have limited commercial availability. Such handicaps have fueled research interest in finding alternative fortification strategies. In recent years, screening of dairy products for CFA-producing bacteria has attracted much attention and has led to the identification of some promising strains, including Bifidobacterium breve NCIMB 702258. This strain has shown interesting producing capabilities in model systems as well as positive modulation of lipid metabolism activities in animal studies. Accordingly, the aim of this research work was to assay B. breve NCIMB 702258 in semi-skimmed milk to produce a probiotic fermented dairy product enriched in bioactive CLA and CLNA. The effect of substrates (LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA) on growth performance and membrane fatty acids profile was also studied, as these potential modifications have been associated to stress response. When tested in cys-MRS culture medium, LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA impaired the fatty  synthesis by B. breve since membrane concentrations for stearic and  acids decreased. Variations in the C18:1 c11 and lactobacillic  concentrations, may suggest that these substrates are also affecting the membrane fluidity. Bifidobacterium breve CFA production capacity was first assessed in cys-MRS with LA, α-LNA, γ-LNA or all substrates together at 0.5 mg/mL each. This strain did not produce CFA from γ-LNA, but converted 31.12% of LA and 68.20% of α-LNA into CLA and CLNA, respectively, after incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. In a second phase, B. breve was inoculated in a commercial semi-skimmed milk with LA, α-LNA or both at 0.5 mg/mL each. Bifidobacterium breve revealed a limited capacity to synthesize CLA isomers, but was able to produce 0.062-0.115 mg/mL CLNA after 24 h at 37 °C. However, organoleptic problems were reported which need to be addressed in future studies. These results show that although CFA were produced at too low concentrations to be able to achieve solely the bioactive dose in one daily portion size, fermented dairy products are a suitable vector to deliver B. breve NCIMB 702258.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29093377>Recovery and Utilization of Palm Oil Mill Effluent Source as Value-Added Food Products.</a></h2><p>The environmental impacts of palm oil mill effluent (POME) have been a concern due to the water pollution and greenhouse gases emissions.

The samples, before (X) and after (Y) the pre-recovery system in the clarification tank were sampled and analysed and proximate analysis indicated that both samples are  rich source of food due to high contents of fats and carbohydrates. GCMS analysis showed that the oil extracts contain predominantly palmitic, , linoleic and stearic acids. Regiospecific analysis of oil extracts by quantitative C-NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that both oil extracts contain similar degree of saturation of fatty acids at sn-2 and sn-1,3 positions. The samples are rich in various phytonutrients, pro-vitamin A, vitamin E, squalene and phytosterols, thus contributing to exceptionally high total flavonoid contents and moderate antioxidant activities.

However, few data are available regarding the effects of α-LA-OA on  metabolism. In this study, we measured glycolysis and mitochondrial functions in HeLa cells in response to α-LA-OA using the XF flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA). The gene expression of enzymes involved in glycolysis, tricarboxylic  cycle, electron transfer chain, and ATP synthesis were also evaluated. Our results show that α-LA-OA significantly enhanced the basal glycolysis and glycolytic capacity. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, including the basal respiration, maximal respiration, spare respiratory capacity and ATP production were also improved in response to α-LA-OA. The enhanced mitochondrial functions maybe partly due to the increased capacity of utilizing fatty acids and glutamine as the substrate. However, the gene expressions of pyruvate kinase M2, lactate dehydrogenase A, aconitate hydratase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 were inhibited, suggesting an insufficient ability for the glycolysis process and the tricarboxylic  cycle. The increased expression of acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 2, a central enzyme involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids, would enhance the unbalance due to the decreased expression of electron transfer flavoprotein β subunit, which acts as the electron acceptor. These results indicated that α-LA-OA may induce oxidative stress due to conditions in which the ATP production is exceeding the  demand. Our results may help clarify the mechanism of apoptosis induced by reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial destruction.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

These applications require surface engineering of as-prepared nanocrystals, commonly coated with hydrophobic ligand of , to enable an aqueous dispersion. However, literature-reported approaches often require a long time and/or multiple step treatment, along with several fold upconversion luminescence (UCL) intensity decrease. Here, we describe a strategy allowing oleate-capped UCNPs to become water-soluble and open-modified, with almost undiminished UCL, through ultrasonication of minutes. The prompt phase transfer was enabled by oleate-mediated supramolecular self-assembly of amino modified β-cyclodextrin (amino-β-CD) onto UCNPs surface. We showed that this method is valid for a wide range of UCNPs with quite different sizes (6-400 nm), various dopant types (Er, Tm, and Ho), and hierarchical structures (core, core-shell). Importantly, the amino group of amino-β-CD on the surface of treated UCNPs provide possibilities to introduce entities for biotargeting or functionalization, as exemplified here, a carboxylic-containing near infrared dye (Cy 7.5) that sensitizes UCNPs to enhance their UCL by ~4,820 fold when excited at ~808 nm.

For high OLA contents, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) results showed that the average size of ZnCdSe increases significantly from 4 to 9 nm with an increasing OLA content from 4 to 10 mL. First, [Zn(OAc)]-OLA complex can be formed by a reaction between Zn(OAc) and OLA. Then, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) data confirmed that ZnO is formed by thermal decomposition of the [Zn(OAc)]-OLA complex. The results indicated that ZnO grew on the ZnCdSe surface, thus increasing the particle size. For low OLA contents, HRTEM images were used to estimate the average sizes of the ZnCdSe alloy QDs, which were approximately 8, 6, and 4 nm with OLA loadings of 0, 2, and 4 mL, respectively. We found that Zn(OAc) and OLA could form a [Zn(OAc)]-OLA complex, which inhibited the growth of the ZnCdSe alloy QDs, due to the decreasing reaction between Zn() and Se, which led to a decrease in particle size.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29726684>Optimizing the Binding  of the Surfactant to Iron Oxide Yields Truly Monodisperse Nanoparticles.</a></h2><p>Despite the great progress in the synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) using a thermal decomposition method, the production of NPs with low polydispersity index is still challenging. In a thermal decomposition synthesis,  (OAC) and oleylamine (OAM) are used as surfactants. The surfactants bind to the growth species, thereby controlling the reaction kinetics and hence playing a critical role in the final size and size distribution of the NPs. Finding an optimum molar ratio between the surfactants  OAC/OAM is therefore crucial. A systematic experimental and theoretical study, however, on the role of the surfactant ratio is still missing. Here, we present a detailed experimental study on the role of the surfactant ratio in size distribution. We found an optimum OAC/OAM ratio of 3 at which the synthesis yielded truly monodisperse (polydispersity less than 7%) iron oxide NPs without employing any post synthesis size-selective procedures. We performed molecular dynamics simulations and showed that the binding  of oleate to the NP is maximized at an OAC/OAM ratio of 3. The optimum OAC/OAM ratio of 3 is allowed for the control of the NP size with nanometer precision by simply changing the reaction heating rate. The optimum OAC/OAM ratio has no influence on the crystallinity and the superparamagnetic behavior of the FeO NPs and therefore can be adopted for the scaled-up production of size-controlled monodisperse FeO NPs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881627>Fluorinated synthetic anion carriers: experimental and computational insights into transmembrane chloride transport.</a></h2><p>A series of fluorinated tripodal tris-thioureas function as highly active anion transporters across lipid bilayers and cell membranes. Here, we investigate their mechanism of action using anion transport assays in cells and synthetic vesicles and molecular modelling of transporter-lipid interactions. When compared with non-fluorinated analogues, fluorinated compounds demonstrate a different mechanism of membrane transport because the free transporter cannot effectively diffuse through the membrane. As a result, in H/Cl cotransport assays, fluorinated transporters require the presence of  to form anionic oleate complexes for recycling of the transporter, whereas non-fluorinated analogues readily diffuse through the membrane as free transporters and show synergistic transport with the proton transporter gramicidin. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed markedly stronger transporter-lipid interactions for fluorinated compounds compared with non-fluorinated analogues and hence, higher  barriers for fluorinated compounds to cross the membrane as free transporters. With use of appropriate proton transporters to ensure measurement of the correct rate-limiting steps, the transport rates determined in synthetic vesicle assays show excellent agreement with the anion transport rates determined in cell-based assays.

Regarding their chemical composition: water ranged from 471.7 to 515.4 g kg and 878.3-885.9 g kg ; fat content in dry matter ranged from 607 to 647 g kg and 6.7-11.6 g kg ; protein varied from 302 to 331.7 g kg and 823.6-892.5 g kg ; ash ranged from 33.7 to 37.7 g kg and 63.8-74.0 g kg ; and nitrogen-free extracts ranged from 12.7 to 36.5 g kg and 35.0-96.2 g kg . The sterols and phospholipids in the yolk lipids were 16-26 g kg and 59-127 g kg . The main fatty acids in the lipids were  (39.1-47.3%) and palmitic (26.0-35.5%) acids. Cholesterol in the yolk lipids ranged from 15.9 to 25.9 g kg . Phosphatidylcholine (389-573 g kg ), phosphatidylethanolamine (219-355 g kg ) and phosphatidylinositol (112-284 g kg ) were the main phospholipids. The content of saturated fatty acids in the phospholipids was significantly higher than that in triacylglycerols.Small variations in the chemical composition of eggs from seven different genotypes were observed. Significant differences in the fatty  compositions of the main classes of phospholipids and the triacylglycerol fraction were established. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29328648>Two-Step Synthesis and Surface Modification of CaZnOS:Mn Phosphors and the Fabrication of a Luminescent Poly(dimethylsiloxane) Film.</a></h2><p>The CaZnOS:Mn (CZOSM) phosphor has been extensively studied for its excellent optical performance, with a typical red emission band peaking at about 580 nm ascribed to the T(G)-A(S) transition of Mn. Herein the CZOSM phosphor was synthesized by a novel two-step method accompanied by control of the morphology of the precursor in the first step followed by sintering in the second step, which demonstrated improved emission intensity and uniform morphology simultaneously compared to those obtained by the traditional solid-state reaction route. Thus, uniform ZnS:Mn particles could be obtained by a hydrothermal method, and then a Ca(OH) shell was coated onto the ZnS:Mn particles via a precipitation reaction. After that, these mixtures were sintered at the optimum temperature 800 °C in an argon atmosphere to prepare the CZOSM particles.  (OA) was further used to transfer the hydrophilic CZOSM phosphors to hydrophobic ones. Finally, luminescent poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) films were fabricated by using the hydrophobic CZOSM@OA powders, and their optical performance and flexibility were evaluated. Our results provide insight into the synthesis of hydrophobic phosphor particles used in luminescent PDMS films and help to unravel their potential application for flexible optical devices.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30113063>High-performance asymmetric supercapacitors based on monodisperse MnO nanocrystals with high  densities.</a></h2><p>Monodisperse spherical MnO nanocrystals (NCs) with a size of 22.5 nm were synthesized by the thermal decomposition of manganese oleate in the presence of  and 1-octadecene.

When breastfeeding is not possible, infant formulas are designed to mimic human milk as much as possible to fulfill infant's requirements. However, the composition of these dairy products is relatively constant, while human milk is not a uniform bio-fluid and changes according to the requirements of the baby. In this study, breast milk samples were donated by 24 Spanish mothers in different lactation stages and different infant formulas were purchased in supermarkets and pharmacies. Gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization detection was used for the fatty  determination. Compared to breast milk, first-stage formulas are apparently very similar in composition; however, no major differences were observed in the fatty  profiles between formulas of different lactation stages. The Galician women breast milk has a fatty  profile rich in , linoleic , arachidonic , and docosahexaenoic . When comparing human milk with formulas, it becomes evident that the manufacturers tend to enrich the formulas with essential fatty acids (especially with α-linolenic ), but arachidonic and docosahexaenoic  levels are lower than in breast milk. Additionally, the obtained results demonstrated that after 1 year of lactation, human milk is still a good source of , essential fatty acids, and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids for the baby.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29068149>One-step Preparation of Carbon-based Solid  Catalyst from Water Hyacinth Leaves for Esterification of  and Dehydration of Xylose.</a></h2><p>Carbon-based solid  catalysts were successfully obtained via one-step hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of water hyacinth (WH) in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic  (PTSA). Increasing the HTC temperature from 180 to 240 °C resulted in carbonaceous materials with increased sulfur content and less adsorbed water. The material obtained at 220 °C (WH-PTSA-220) contains the highest amount of  sites and promotes the highest initial rate of two transformations, that is, methanolysis of  and dehydration of xylose to furfural. While all PSTA-treated WH catalysts gave comparable fatty  conversions (≈97 %) and furfural yields (≈60 %) after prolonged reaction times, the WH-PTSA-240 system bearing a relatively low  density maintains the most favorable reusability profile. Higher HTC temperatures (220-240 °C) improved the catalyst reusability profiles due to graphitization and hydrophobicity of the carbon surface.

Mixed FW was mechanically macerated (Pcon) and hydrolysed (at 250gL water) via chemical (Ch), thermal (Th) and TCh (combined Ch and Th) treatments. Cleared hydrolysates from individual pre-treatment processes were used as culture medium for cultivation of R. glutinis, while the residual solids (RS) were subjected to AD. Pcon cultivation yielded maximal R. glutinis dry weight biomass (5.18gL) and total fatty  contents (1.03gg DW). Dominant fatty  methyl esters (FAME) were Palmitic - (C-26%); Stearic - (C-17%) and  acids (C-38%), ideal for bio-diesel production. Highest methane yields (actual ∼0.139mkg volatile solids) were measured from AD of Th-derived RS.

The aim of the present study was to examine whether EPA could affect substrate cycling in human skeletal muscle cells by altering lipolysis rate of intracellular TAG and re-esterification of fatty acids. Fatty  metabolism was studied in human myotubes using a mixture of fatty acids, consisting of radiolabelled  as tracer (14C-OA) together with EPA or PA. Co-incubation of myotubes with EPA increased cell-accumulation and incomplete fatty  oxidation of 14C-OA compared to co-incubation with PA. Lipid distribution showed higher incorporation of 14C-OA into all cellular lipids after co-incubation with EPA relative to PA, with most markedly increases (3 to 4-fold) for diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol. Further, the increases in cellular lipids after co-incubation with EPA were accompanied by higher lipolysis and fatty  re-esterification rate. Correspondingly, basal respiration, proton leak and maximal respiration were significantly increased in cells exposed to EPA compared to PA. Microarray and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that EPA, related to PA, significantly changed i.e. the GO terms "Neutral lipid metabolic process" and "Regulation of lipid storage". Finally, an inhibitor of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 decreased the effect of EPA to promote fatty  accumulation. In conclusion, incubation of human myotubes with EPA, compared to PA, increased processes of fatty  turnover and oxidation suggesting that EPA may activate futile substrate cycling of fatty acids in human myotubes. Increased TAG-FA cycling may be involved in the potentially favourable effects of long-chain polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids on skeletal muscle and whole-body  metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30053283>Diets Low in Saturated Fat with Different Unsaturated Fatty  Profiles Similarly Increase Serum-Mediated Cholesterol Efflux from THP-1 Macrophages in a Population with or at Risk for Metabolic Syndrome: The Canola Oil Multicenter Intervention Trial.</a></h2><p>Cholesterol efflux plays an important role in preventing atherosclerosis progression. Vegetable oils with varying unsaturated fatty  profiles favorably affect multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors; however, their effects on cholesterol efflux remain unclear.The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of diets low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with varying unsaturated fatty  profiles on serum-mediated cholesterol efflux and its association with the plasma lipophilic index and central obesity.The present study is a randomized, crossover, controlled-feeding study. Participants [men: n = 50; women: n = 51; mean ± SE age: 49.5 ± 1.2 y; body mass index (in kg/m2): 29.4 ± 0.4] at risk for or with metabolic syndrome (MetS) were randomly assigned to 5 isocaloric diets containing the treatment oils: canola oil, high -canola oil, DHA-enriched high -canola oil, corn oil and safflower oil blend, and flax oil and safflower oil blend. These treatment oils were incorporated into smoothies that participants consumed 2 times/d. For a 3000-kcal diet, 60 g of treatment oil was required to provide 18% of total  per day. Each diet period was 4 wk followed by a 2- to 4-wk washout period. We quantified cholesterol efflux capacity with a validated ex vivo high-throughput cholesterol efflux assay. Statistical analyses were performed with the use of the SAS mixed-model procedure.The 5 diets increased serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity from THP-1 macrophages similarly by 39%, 34%, 55%, 49% and 51%, respectively, compared with baseline (P < 0.05 for all). Waist circumference and abdominal adiposity were negatively correlated with serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity (r = -0.25, P = 0.01, r = -0.33, P = 0.02, respectively).Diets low in SFAs with different monounsaturated fatty  and polyunsaturated fatty  profiles improved serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity in individuals with or at risk for MetS. This mechanism may account, in part, for the cardiovascular disease benefits of diets low in SFAs and high in unsaturated fatty acids. Importantly, central obesity is inversely associated with cholesterol efflux capacity.

Discrepancies between studies may be due to differences in study population, as subjects with increased baseline BP levels may be more responsive. Therefore, we examined specifically the effects of ALA on 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in (pre-)hypertensive subjects. In a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled parallel study, fifty-nine overweight and obese adults (forty males and nineteen females) with (pre-)hypertension (mean age of 60 (sd 8) years) received daily 10 g refined cold-pressed flaxseed oil, providing 4·7 g (approximately 2 % of ) ALA (n 29) or 10 g of high- sunflower oil as control (n 30) for 12 weeks. Compliance was excellent as indicated by vial count and plasma phospholipid fatty- composition. Compared with control, the changes of -1·4 mmHg in mean arterial pressure (MAP; 24 h ABP) after flaxseed oil intake (95 % CI -4·8, 2·0 mmHg, P=0·40) of -1·5 mmHg in systolic BP (95 % CI -6·0, 3·0 mmHg, P=0·51) and of -1·4 mmHg in diastolic BP (95 % CI -4·2, 1·4 mmHg, P=0·31) were not statistically significant. Also, no effects were found for office BP and for MAP, systolic BP, and diastolic BP when daytime and night-time BP were analysed separately and for night-time dipping. In conclusion, high intake of ALA, about 3-5 times recommended daily intakes, for 12 weeks does not significantly affect BP in subjects with (pre-)hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30488102>Lipid acquisition and tissue storage in hagfish: new insights from an ancient vertebrate.</a></h2><p>Hagfishes are ancient vertebrates, which have the ability to tolerate nearly a year of food deprivation with  during fasting maintained using lipid stores. While lipid transporters are evolutionarily conserved, there are relatively few studies examining mechanisms of lipid acquisition in teleosts and no reports in the primitive and evolutionarily important agnathans. We examined tissue lipid droplet distribution and used gut sac preparations to characterize uptake mechanisms of the monounsaturated fatty ,  (OA; 18:1 cis-9), in the Pacific hagfish. OA absorption was carrier-mediated and demonstrated saturable concentration-dependent uptake with an affinity constant of 55 ± 7 µM, and a maximal rate of uptake of 1311 ± 97 pmol cm h. Additionally, regulation of intestinal transport was demonstrated as feeding significantly increased uptake. To further examine post-prandial effects on fatty  transport, hagfish were dosed with bovine insulin, which had no effect on OA intestinal acquisition, but did lower plasma glucose. Overall, this is the first evidence for intestinal fatty  acquisition in an agnathan, which are ideal models for understanding the evolution of nutrient transport processes in vertebrates, and are particularly suited to lipid research owing to their dependence upon this  source during prolonged periods of fasting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108757>Effect of co-culture with Tetragenococcus halophilus on the physiological characterization and transcription profiling of Zygosaccharomyces rouxii.</a></h2><p>Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and Tetragenococcus halophilus are widely existed and play vital roles during the manufacture of fermented foods such as soy sauce. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of T. halophilus CGMCC 3792 on the physiological characterizations and transcription profiling of Z. rouxii CGMCC 3791. Salt tolerance analysis revealed that co-culture with T. halophilus enhanced the salt tolerance of Z. rouxii during salt stress. Analysis of the volatile compounds revealed that co-culture reduced the level of 1-butanol, improved the level of octanoic  which all were produced by T. halophilus and reduced the level of phenylethyl alcohol produced by Z. rouxii. The presence of Z. rouxii decreased the contents of 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde and acetic  produced by T. halophilus. In addition, co-culture improved the content of benzyl alcohol significantly. Analysis of membrane fatty  showed that co-culture improved the content of palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids in cells of Z. rouxii, and reduced the contents of myristic (C14:0), palmitoleic  (C16:1) and  (C18:1). In order to further explore the interactions between the two strains, RNA-seq technology was used to investigate the effect of co-culture with T. halophilus on the transcription profiling of Z. rouxii. By comparing cells incubated in co-culture group with cells incubated in single-culture group, a total of 967 genes were considered as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among the DEGs, 72 genes were up-regulated, while 895 genes were down-regulated. These DEGs took party in various activities in cells of Z. rouxii, and the result showed co-culture with T. halophilus had a positive effect on proteolysis, the attachment of a cell to another cell, extracellular protein accumulation,  metabolism, and a negative effect on oxidative phosphorylation, small molecular substances metabolism, DNA replication and repair, and transcription in cells of Z. rouxii.

(OA) is a widely used capping ligand. Here, we report blue emission from OA in its free molecular form and further demonstrate this by anchoring OA over the surfaces of Al2O3, ZnAl2O4(ZA), ZnAl2O4:Eu3+ (ZA:Eu3+), and Y2O3:Eu3+. White light emission was observed from OA-modified ZA:Eu3+ nanophosphor due to mixing of broad blue emission of OA and red emission of Eu3+ through  transfer from OA to Eu3+. A detailed study revealed the characteristic binding modes of OA and their dependence on Eu3+ concentration, structural inversion in ZA, and the optical properties and surface states in the pristine and OA-modified ZA:Eu3+. First principles density functional theory calculations were employed to provide an insight into the HOMO-LUMO levels of OA molecule and, electronic structure of pristine and OA-modified ZA surface. The binding of OA with the ZA:xEu3+ surface changes from bridging bidentate to chelating bidentate with increasing Eu3+ concentration in the lattice. The surface binding nature of the carboxylate group with the optimized surface of ZA and the creation of mid-gap states were deduced theoretically by using butanoic  instead of OA. The blue emission from OA and its mixing with Eu3+ emission was further confirmed experimentally by anchoring it over Y2O3:Eu3+ red phosphor.

Excess of meat in the diet leads to high content of palmitic fatty  (FA) in hepatocytes and formation of palmitic triglycerides (TG). Post heparin lipoprotein lipase slowly hydrolyzes palmitic TG in blood plasma lipoproteins and releases small amounts of FA. If dietary carbohydrate content is low, the biological function of exotrophy does not provide the substrate from which hepatocytes can rapidly produce  nonesterified FA de novo.  substrate deficiency activates the biological function of adaptation and the biological reaction of compensation. Under the effect of epinephrin NEFA deficiency is compensated via the biological reaction of endotrophy and lipolysis in omental visceral fat cells. In insulin resistance (IR) syndrome, the biological function of feeding is realized nonphysiologically while the biological reaction of adaptation is realized physiologically. An increase in NEFA blood content physiologically blocks glucose uptake in cells. Biological role of insulin consists in conversion of distant ocean-living carnivorous (fish-eating) ancestors of Homo sapiens with palmitic type of FA metabolism into herbivorous dry land-living species with  type metabolism of FA. The IR syndrome can be normalized. To this end a) the patient's will to activate the cognitive biological function (intellect) and b) comprehension of the fact that phylogenetically dry land-living Homo sapiens has developed as a herbivorous but not carnivorous species.

These disorders form the pathophysiological basis for all metabolic pandemias: 1) atherosclerosis and atheromatosis, 2) essential arterial hypertension, 3) metabolic syndrome, 4) obesity, 5) insulin resistance syndrome, 6) nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and 7) endogenous hyperuricemia. Persistent potential deficiency of  for realization of all biological reactions and functions is the major metabolic disorders in diabetes mellitus.

The branched-chain fatty , 10-methyl stearic , is synthesized from  in certain bacteria; the fatty  is saturated, but melting point is low.

Currently, effective treatments for OXPHOS defects, with complex I deficiency being the most prevalent, are not available. Yet, clinical practice has shown that some complex I deficient patients benefit from a high-fat or ketogenic diet, but it is unclear how these therapeutic diets influence mitochondrial function and more importantly, which complex I patients could benefit from such treatment.

We performed whole-exome sequencing to characterize the genetic defect. A pathogenic homozygous p.G212V missense mutation was identified in the  gene, encoding an early assembly factor of complex I. A complementation study in fibroblasts confirmed that the p.G212V mutation caused the complex I deficiency. The mechanism turned out to be an incomplete assembly of the peripheral arm of complex I, leading to a decrease in the amount of mature complex I. The patient clinically improved on a high-fat diet, which was supported by the 25% increase in maximal OXPHOS capacity in TMEM126B defective fibroblast by the saturated fatty  palmitic , whereas  did not have any effect in those fibroblasts. Fibroblasts of other patients with a characterized complex I gene defect were tested in the same way. Patient fibroblasts with complex I defects in NDUFS7 and NDUFAF5 responded to palmitic , whereas ACAD9, NDUFA12, and NDUFV2 defects were non-responding. Although the data are too limited to draw a definite conclusion on the mechanism, there is a tendency that protein defects involved in early assembly complexes, improve with palmitic , whereas proteins defects involved in late assembly, do not. Our data show at a clinical and biochemical level that a high fat diet can be beneficial for complex I patients and that our cell line assay will be an easy tool for the selection of patients, who might potentially benefit from this therapeutic diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29569538>Serum metabolomics study of nutrient metabolic variations in chronic heat-stressed broilers.</a></h2><p>To investigate the effects of heat stress on broiler metabolism, we assigned 144 broilers to normal control (NC), heat stress (HS) or pair-fed (PF) groups and then monitored the effects using growth performance, carcass characteristics, biochemical assays and GC-MS-based metabolomics. The up-regulation of cloacal temperature confirmed that our experiment was successful in inducing chronic heat stress. The average daily gain and average daily feed intake of the HS group were significantly lower than those of the NC group, by 28·76 and 18·42 %, respectively (P1 and P<0·05). The greater feed:gain ratio of the HS group was significantly positively correlated with the leg, abdominal fat, subcutaneous fat and intramuscular fat proportions and levels of some free amino acids (proline, l-cysteine, methionine and threonine) but was negatively correlated with breast proportion and levels of some NEFA (stearic , arachidonic , palmitic  and ). These findings indicated that the heat-stressed broilers were in negative  balance and unable to effectively mobilise fat, thereby resulting in protein decomposition, which subsequently affected growth performance and carcass characteristics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29500968>Effects of a hypoenergetic diet rich in α-linolenic  on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in overweight and obese patients with metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Plant-derived α-linolenic  (ALA) may exert cardioprotective effects. Dietary ALA can undergo desaturation and elongation to form long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but the extent to which this occurs in humans is unclear. The aim of the study was to examine the effects of an -restricted diet enriched with ALA on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in patients with metabolic syndrome.The present analysis compared the effects of a hypoenergetic diet high in ALA (3.4 g/d) with a control diet low in ALA (0.9 g/d) on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in 81 overweight or obese patients with features of metabolic syndrome.After a 26-wk intervention, concentration of ALA in serum phospholipids remained constant in both diet groups. The control group had a significant decrease in serum phospholipid eicosapentaenoic  concentration, although no significant intergroup difference was observed. Serum phospholipid docosahexaenoic  concentration significantly decreased to a similar extent with both interventions. Additionally, both interventions significantly decreased serum phospholipid concentrations of palmitic , stearic , total saturated fatty acids, linoleic , total ω-6 and ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, with no effect of diet group on these changes. Compared with the ALA diet, the control diet led to a significant increase in serum phospholipid  concentration.Daily intake of 3.4 g of ALA during a 26-wk -restricted diet did not lead to an enrichment of serum phospholipids with ALA and did not increase eicosapentaenoic  due to conversion. Additionally, dietary ALA was unable to compensate for a decrease in serum phospholipid docosahexaenoic .Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, hot-water-repellent surfaces have received much attention in recent years because of their wide range of applications. However, coatings with stability against boiling in hot water have not been achieved yet. Long-chain perfluorinated materials, which are often used for liquid-repellent coatings owing to their low surface , hinder the potential application of antifouling coatings in food containers. Herein, we design a fluorine-free slippery surface that immobilizes a biocompatible lubricant layer on a phenyl-group-modified smooth solid surface through OH-π interactions. The smooth base layer was fabricated by modification of phenyltriethoxysilane through a sol-gel method. The π-electrons of the phenyl groups interact with the carboxyl group of the  used as a lubricant, which facilitates immobilization on the base layer. Water droplets slid off the surface in the temperature range from 20 to 80 °C at very low sliding angles (<2°). Furthermore, we increased the π-electron density in the base layer to strengthen the OH-π interactions, which improved long-term boiling stability under hot water. We believe that this surface will be applied in fields in which the practical use of antifouling coatings is desirable, such as food containers, drink cans, and glassware.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128719>Metabolomic foundation for differential responses of lipid metabolism to nitrogen and phosphorus deprivation in an arachidonic -producing green microalga.</a></h2><p>The green oleaginous microalga Lobosphaera incisa accumulates storage lipids triacylglycerols (TAG) enriched in the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  arachidonic  under nitrogen (N) deprivation. In contrast, under phosphorous (P) deprivation, the production of the monounsaturated  prevails. We compared physiological responses, ultrastructural, and metabolic consequences of L. incisa acclimation to N and P deficiency to provide novel insights into the key determinants of ARA accumulation. Differential responses to nutrient deprivation on growth performance, carbon-to-nitrogen stoichiometry, membrane lipid composition and TAG accumulation were demonstrated. Ultrastructural analyses suggested a dynamic role for vacuoles in sustaining cell homeostasis under conditions of different nutrient availability and their involvement in autophagy in L. incisa. Paralleling ARA-rich TAG accumulation in lipid droplets, N deprivation triggered intensive chloroplast dismantling and promoted catabolic processes. Metabolome analysis revealed depletion of amino acids and pyrimidines, and repression of numerous biosynthetic hubs to favour TAG biosynthesis under N deprivation. Under P deprivation, despite the relatively low growth penalties, the presence of the endogenous P reserves and the characteristic lipid remodelling, metabolic signatures of  deficiency were revealed. Metabolome adjustments to P deprivation included depletion in ATP and phosphorylated nucleotides, increased levels of TCA-cycle intermediates and osmoprotectants. We conclude that characteristic cellular and metabolome adjustments tailor the adaptive responses of L. incisa to N and P deprivation modulating its LC-PUFA production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We show here that Minerval also acts, selectively in cancer cell lines, as an ATP depleting uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). As a function of its exposure time, Minerval compromised the capacity of glioblastoma U87-MG cells to compensate for aberrant respiration by up-modulation of glycolysis. This effect was not exposure time-dependent in the lung carcinoma A549 cell line, which was more sensitive to Minerval. Compared with OxPhos inhibitors FCCP (uncoupler), rotenone (electron transfer inhibitor), and oligomycin (F1F0-ATPase inhibitor), Minerval action was similar only to that of FCCP. This similarity was manifested by mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depolarization, facilitation of oxygen consumption rate (OCR), restriction of mitochondrial and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial fragmentation. Additionally, compared with other OxPhos inhibitors, Minerval uniquely induced ER stress in cancer cell lines. These new modes of action for Minerval, capitalizing on the high fatty  requirements of cancer cells, can potentially enhance its cancer-selective toxicity and improve its therapeutic capacity.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29800700>Antibacterial activity of the bioactive compounds identified in three woody plants against some pathogenic bacteria.</a></h2><p>Three bacterial isolates were identified from infected potato tubers showing soft and blackleg like symptoms as well as one isolate from infected pear tree showing crown gall symptom.

Since it can be made through de novo synthesis in animals, it is not an essential fatty . While it has become clear that dietary  regulates many biological processes, the signaling pathway involved in these regulations remains poorly defined. In this work we tested the impact of an -rich diet on hepatic gene expression. We were particularly interested in addressing the contribution of Liver X Receptors (LXR) in the control of genes involved in hepatic lipogenesis, an essential process in whole body  homeostasis. We used wild-type mice and transgenic mice deficient for both α and β Liver X Receptor isoforms (LXR-/-) fed a control or an oleate enriched diet. We observed that hepatic-lipid accumulation was enhanced as well as the expression of lipogenic genes in the liver of wild-type mice fed the oleate enriched diet. In contrast, none of these changes occurred in the liver of LXR-/- mice. Strikingly, oleate-rich diet reduced cholesterolemia in wild-type mice and induced signs of liver inflammation and damage in LXR-/- mice but not in wild-type mice. This work suggests that dietary  reduces cholesterolemia while promoting LXR-dependent hepatic lipogenesis without detrimental effects to the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30032652>Impact of ultrasonication techniques on the preparation of novel Amiloride-nanoemulsion used for intranasal delivery in the treatment of epilepsy.</a></h2><p>To develop a nanoemulsion-nanoformulation in order to enhance brain bioavailability for Amiloride (Amilo) via intranasal (i.n.) drug delivery in the brain., Tween-20 and Carbitol were selected as oil, surfactant and co-surfactant, respectively.

Unfortunately, experimental measurements of K exist almost exclusively for atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, with very few studies focusing on SVOCs that occur in indoor environments. A specially designed tube chamber operating in the laminar flow regime was developed to measure K of the plasticizer di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) for one inorganic (ammonium sulfate) and two organic ( and squalane) particles. The values of K for the organic particles (0.23 ± 0.13 m/μg for  and 0.11 ± 0.10 m/μg for squalane) are an order of magnitude higher than those for the inorganic particles (0.011 ± 0.004 m/μg), suggesting that the process by which the particles accumulate SVOCs is different. A mechanistic model based on the experimental design reveals that the presence of the particles increases the gas-phase concentration gradient in the boundary layer, resulting in enhanced mass transfer from the emission source into the air.

The DESs were synthesized using a hydrogen bond donor (i.e., ) and a hydrogen bond acceptor (i.e., dl-menthol) by using the COSMO-SAC-predicted equimolar ratio at a temperature of 350.15 K. Thereafter, NDDESs or nanofluids were formed by dispersing different volume fractions (0.001, 0.005, 0.0075, and 0.01) of AlO nanoparticles in the DESs. The optimum volume fraction (0.005) of AlO nanoparticles was selected through their thermophysical properties (density, viscosity, thermal conductivity, and specific heat capacity) and its agglomeration or stability behavior. As expected, NDDESs with a 0.005 volume fraction gave a higher enhancement in thermal conductivity, viscosity, heat capacity, and density as compared to DESs. To evaluate the heat transfer coefficient, forced convection experiments were conducted in a circular test section for both DESs and NDDESs under laminar conditions ( = 124, 186, and 250). The enhancement of the local heat transfer coefficient was found to be higher when compared to their thermophysical properties.

Analysis of covariance, principal components analysis (PCA) and adjusted logistic regression were applied, accounting for the survey design and sample weights.Of the 4864 eligible participants, 2482 (51.0%) were men and 269 (5.5%) had prevalent PAD. PCA uncovered three DPs which accounted for 56.8% of the variance in dietary nutrients consumption including DP1 (fatty acids and cholesterol), DP2 (minerals, vitamins and fiber), and DP3 (polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFA]). PAD patients had a significantly higher serum concentrations of trans 9-octadecenoic  and trans 9, trans 12-octadienoic  as well as lower plasma levels of vitamin D, retinol, retinyl stearate and retinyl palmitate (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). In models adjusted for age, race, diabetes, cholesterol, hypertension, smoking and  intake, individuals in the highest quartile of the DP1 had higher odds for PAD compared with those in the lowest quartile [(odds ratio (OR): 6.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.00-20.63 p < 0.001], while those in the highest quartile of DP2 and DP3 had lower odds of PAD relative to those in the lowest quartile (OR:0.28, OR:0.44, respectively; p < 0.001 for both comparisons).We found that quality of diet, plasma vitamins and TFAs are associated with the likelihood of PAD. If confirmed in prospective studies, the possibility that dietary factors, plasma vitamins and TFAs might be valuable for preventing or delaying the clinical progression of PAD, should be investigated in intervention trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30744359>Enhanced oxidative stability of meat by including tannin-rich leaves of woody plants in goat diet.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dietary incorporation of tannin-rich woody species on meat oxidative stability, carcass traits and meat quality in goats.Two tannin-rich species were tested using a three-treatments feeding trial, where treatments consisted of: Larrea divaricata and Acacia aroma both at 12.5% in dry matter basis of the diet and a control diet (alfalfa hay). All feeding diets were iso-protein and iso-. Carcass conformation, carcass compactness, carcass fatness and subcutaneous fat deposition were evaluated. Intake, liveweigh, Longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscles of goats were analyzed in order to evaluate quality parameters such as pH value, instrumental color evaluation, water holding capacity, total phenolic content, antioxidant activity, meat oxidative stability and fatty  profiles in meat.Feed intake, liveweight gain, carcass and meat traits did not differ among treatments. Changes in meat lipid profile among treatments were observed for  and elaidic  contents. Meat total phenolic content and antioxidant activity did not differ among treatments; although, meat oxidative status after storage at room temperature, as well as under refrigerated and frozen conditions were different between control and both supplemented groups.The inclusion of Acacia aroma and Larrea divaricata leaves in goat diet enhanced meat oxidative stability.

This self-assembly process can be controlled by the  of ligand-ligand interactions between surface ligands on Fe O NCs and Zr O (OH) (fumarate) MOF NPs. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM)/-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and TEM tomography confirm the hierarchical co-assembly of Fe O NCs with MOF NPs as ligand energies are manipulated to promote facile diffusion of the smaller NCs. First-principles calculations and event-driven molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the observed patterns are dictated by combination of ligand-surface and ligand-ligand interactions. This study opens a new avenue for design and self-assembly of MOFs and NCs into high surface area assemblies, mimicking the structure of supported catalyst architectures, and provides a thorough fundamental understanding of the self-assembly process, which could be a guide for designing functional materials with desired structure.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The present study aimed to maximise the process conditions for oil extraction and sterculia biodiesel production from Sterculia foetida (poon oil). GC-MS identified the methyl esters of sterculia oil as sterculic  (32%), palmitic  (15.88%),  (10.00%), linoleic  (9.95%) and malvalic  (9%). Response surface methodology (RSM) based parametric optimisation of oil extraction was carried out by choosing process variables such as sample weight, volume of solvent to seed ratio and time. The optimum sample amount of 7.5 g and the volume of solvent to seed ratio of 40 mL/g resulted in a maximum oil yield of 45.27% at 3 h. The results were statistically significant (P < 0.05) with a regression coefficient (R) of 0.9988. Furthermore, the artificial neural network (ANN) resulted in an R value greater than 0.9, which validates the RSM. Conventional optimisation of the temperature (55 °C), feedstock to methanol ratio (1:12), catalyst proportion (1.5%) and transesterification reaction time (60 min) yield 90.87% biodiesel production. The physicochemical characteristics of oil and biodiesel complied with the requirements of the ASTM standards. The rate constant and thermodynamic variables at the optimum temperature (333 K) were calculated from the experimental data. The activation  (E), activation enthalpy in transition state theory (ΔH), activation entropy in transition state theory (ΔS) and Gibbs free  in transition state theory (ΔG) were 37.91 kJ mol, 35.14 kJ mol, - 239.58 J mol K and 79.81 kJ mol respectively.

Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of KetoA [10-oxo-12()-octadecenoic ]-a linoleic  metabolite produced by gut lactic  bacteria-on whole-body  metabolism and found that dietary intake of KetoA could enhance  expenditure in mice, thereby protecting mice from diet-induced obesity. By using Ca imaging and whole-cell patch-clamp methods, KetoA was noted to potently activate transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and enhance noradrenalin turnover in adipose tissues. In addition, KetoA up-regulated genes that are related to brown adipocyte functions, including uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in white adipose tissue (WAT), which was later diminished in the presence of a β-adrenoreceptor blocker. By using obese and diabetic model KK-Ay mice, we further show that KetoA intake ameliorated obesity-associated metabolic disorders. In the absence of any observed KetoA-induced antiobesity effect or UCP1 up-regulation in TRPV1-deficient mice, we prove that the antiobesity effect of KetoA was caused by TRPV1 activation-mediated browning in WAT.

Nanomedicines have shown significant antimicrobial potential against various drug-resistant microbes. Silver nanoparticles (AgNps) are known for their antimicrobial properties and lower host toxicity; however, for clinical applications, evaluation of their impact at cellular and molecular levels is essential. The present study aims to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of AgNp-induced toxicity in a common fungal pathogen, .AgNps were synthesized by chemical reduction method and characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy- dispersive X-ray spectroscopy,  dispersive X-ray fluorescence, and zeta potential. The anti- activity of AgNps was assessed by broth microdilution and spot assays. Effects of AgNps on cellular and molecular targets were assessed by monitoring the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the absence and presence of natural antioxidant, changes in surface morphology, cellular ultrastructure, membrane microenvironment, membrane fluidity, membrane ergosterol, and fatty acids.Spherical AgNps (10-30 nm) showed minimum inhibitory concentration (minimum concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms) at 40 μg/mL. Our results demonstrated that AgNps induced dose-dependent intracellular ROS which exerted antifungal effects; however, even scavenging ROS by antioxidant could not offer protection from AgNp mediated killing. Treatment with AgNps altered surface morphology, cellular ultrastructure, membrane microenvironment, membrane fluidity, ergosterol content, and fatty  composition, especially .To summarize, AgNps affected multiple cellular targets crucial for drug resistance and pathogenicity in the fungal cells. The study revealed new cellular targets of AgNps which include fatty acids like , vital for hyphal morphogenesis (a pathogenic trait of ).

Because LCFAs also induce oxidative stress, which may be detrimental to bacterial growth, it is imperative to understand the strategies employed by bacteria to counteract such stresses. Here, we performed a genetic screen in  on the LCFA, oleate, and compared our results with published genome-wide screens of multiple non-fermentable carbon sources. This large-scale analysis revealed that among components of the aerobic electron transport chain (ETC), only genes involved in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone, an electron carrier in the ETC, are highly required for growth in LCFAs when compared with other carbon sources. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we show that this increased requirement of ubiquinone is to mitigate elevated levels of reactive oxygen species generated by LCFA degradation. Intriguingly, we find that unlike other ETC components whose requirement for growth is inversely correlated with the  yield of non-fermentable carbon sources, the requirement of ubiquinone correlates with oxidative stress. Our results therefore suggest that a mechanism in addition to the known electron carrier function of ubiquinone is required to explain its antioxidant role in LCFA metabolism. Importantly, among the various oxidative stress combat players in , ubiquinone acts as the cell's first line of defense against LCFA-induced oxidative stress. Taken together, our results emphasize that ubiquinone is a key antioxidant during LCFA metabolism and therefore provides a rationale for investigating its role in LCFA-utilizing pathogenic bacteria.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29085382>Variant Amino  Residues Alter the Enzyme Activity of Peanut Type 2 Diacylglycerol Acyltransferases.</a></h2><p>Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) catalyzes the final step in triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis via the acyl-CoA-dependent acylation of diacylglycerol. This reaction is a major control point in the Kennedy pathway for biosynthesis of TAG, which is the most important form of stored metabolic  in most oil-producing plants. In this study, Arachis hypogaea type 2 DGAT (AhDGAT2) genes were cloned from the peanut cultivar 'Luhua 14.' Sequence analysis of 11 different peanut cultivars revealed a gene family of 8 peanut DGAT2 genes (designated AhDGAT2a-h). Sequence alignments revealed 21 nucleotide differences between the eight ORFs, but only six differences result in changes to the predicted amino  (AA) sequences. A representative full-length cDNA clone (AhDGAT2a) was characterized in detail. The biochemical effects of altering the AhDGAT2a sequence to include single variable AA residues were tested by mutagenesis and functional complementation assays in transgenic yeast systems. All six mutant variants retained enzyme activity and produced lipid droplets in vivo. The N6D and A26P mutants also displayed increased enzyme activity and/or total cellular fatty  (FA) content. N6D mutant mainly increased the content of palmitoleic , and A26P mutant mainly increased the content of palmitic . The A26P mutant grew well both in the presence of  and C18:2, but the other mutants grew better in the presence of C18:2. AhDGAT2 is expressed in all peanut organs analyzed, with high transcript levels in leaves and flowers. These levels are comparable to that found in immature seeds, where DGAT2 expression is most abundant in other plants. Over-expression of AhDGAT2a in tobacco substantially increased the FA content of transformed tobacco seeds. Expression of AhDGAT2a also altered transcription levels of endogenous tobacco lipid metabolic genes in transgenic tobacco, apparently creating a larger carbon 'sink' that supports increased FA levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29244016> in the modulation of oocyte and preimplantation embryo development.</a></h2><p>Potential reproductive effects are considered as the major aspect of biomolecules functionality in an organism.

In DSSCs, the triiodide reduction at the surface of TiO is one of the detrimental processes that limit the realization of high efficiencies of the device. To alleviate the active sites available on the semiconductor surface for this detrimental process, the interfacial modification of the dye-adsorbed TiO|electrolyte interface has been attempted by coadsorption of  (OA) over the TiO surface. Thus, the modified cell exhibited a higher efficiency (η) of 12.9% under one sun illumination when compared with that of the unmodified cell (η = 11.1%). To provide an insight into the OA anchoring and dynamics of electron transport at the photoanode|electrolyte interface, molecular spectroscopic and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analyses were carried out. A red shift in the optical absorption spectrum was observed after the addition of OA to dye-adsorbed TiO. The binding of OA to TiO surface was found to be through bridging bidentate type. Mott-Schottky analyses of the DSSCs under dark conditions were made to probe the shift in the Fermi level of TiO upon OA modification. In addition, the Förster resonance  transfer (FRET) has been found between OA and N719 dye. Thus, the red shift in the optical absorption, enhanced electron-transfer kinetics, and FRET contributes to the observed enhancement in the efficiency of the device containing OA-modified photoanode.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553054>High-fat diet induces aberrant hepatic lipid secretion in blunt snout bream by activating endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated IRE1/XBP1 pathway.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to understand the effect of high-fat diet challenge on lipid transport and endoplasmic reticulum stress in blunt snout bream. Ninety fish (average weight: 41.84 ± 0.07 g) were randomly fed a control diet (6% fat) or a high-fat diet (11% fat) for 9 weeks. The growth performance and feed utilization efficiency were evaluated at the end of the trial. The liver samples of both groups were harvested for molecular analysis and histological evaluation. Compared to the Control group, the high-fat diet group showed no effects on either growth performance or  intake in blunt snout bream. However, high-fat diet resulted in a massive accumulation of lipid and pathological structural alternations, and disrupted expression of lipid transport-related genes and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the liver of the fish. In vitro, after exposure of the isolated primary hepatocytes from blunt snout bream to , the cells showed increased intracellular TG accumulation, decreased VLDL secretion, which was attributed to altered expression levels of lipid transport-related genes through the activated IRE1/XBP1 signaling. The -induced detrimental effects were alleviated by co-incubating the cells with an IER1 inhibitor, 4μ8c. In conclusion, high-fat diet could lead to aberrant lipid secretion by activating the ER stress-associated IRE1/XBP1 pathway. Inhibiting the activity of IRE1 represents a promising target to rescue the side-effects of high-fat diet on the liver function of blunt snout bream.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the associations of MUFA consumption from different sources with mortality remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationships between MUFA intakes from plant and animal sources and mortality.A total of 14,305 participants from China Health and Nutrition Survey were prospectively followed up for 14 years. Dietary intake of MUFAs was assessed by 3-day 24-h dietary records in each round. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).A total of 1006 deaths occurred during 199,091 person-years of follow-up. Intake of total MUFAs was not associated with mortality (P-trend = 0.17). The plant-sourced MUFA intake was strongly associated with lower mortality [HR (95% CI) 0.72 (0.58-0.89); P-trend = 0.008], whereas animal-sourced MUFA intake showed no significant association. Likewise,  (OA) and palmitoleic  (PA) intakes from plant sources were also inversely associated with mortality [HR (95% CI) 0.66 (0.52-0.84) for OA and 0.73 (0.59-0.91) for PA], while animal-sourced OA and PA were not related to mortality. Theoretically replacing saturated fatty acids (SFAs) (5% of total ) with isocaloric plant-sourced MUFAs was associated with 15% (95% CI 5-25%) lower mortality. In addition, 18% (95% CI 10-26%) lower mortality was observed when theoretically replacing the sum of SFAs and animal-sourced MUFAs with isocaloric plant-sourced MUFAs.Intakes of MUFAs, including OA and PA, from plant but not animal sources were associated with lower total mortality. These findings suggested the importance of consuming MUFAs from plant-based foods for overall health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560748>Effect of stearic or  on milk performance and  partitioning when fed in diets with low and high rumen active unsaturated fatty acids in early lactation.</a></h2><p>This experiment was conducted to determine the effects of stearic  (SA; C18:0) or rumen protected  (OA; C18:1 cis-9) on milk performance and  partitioning of early lactation cows when supplemented in diets with low and high level of rumen unsaturated fatty acids (RUFA). In low RUFA experiment (LRUFA), FA supplement rich in either SA or calcium salts-OA was added to a basal diet with a low concentration of RUFA (0.75 vs 1.4 %, LRUFA-SA vs LRUFA-OA). In high RUFA experiment (HRUFA), 2% soybean oil was added to the diet fed in the LRUFA experiment. In each experiment, thirty multiparous cows were blocked by parity and predicted transmitting ability for milk yield and were randomly fed one of two treatment diets from 2 to 13 wk postpartum. In the LRUFA experiment, LRUFA-SA had 2.4 kg/d more dry matter intake (DMI) (P < 0.01), 3.8 kg/d more  corrected milk (P < 0.01), and 0.3%-units more milk fat percentage (P < 0.01) and 0.2 kg/d more milk fat yield (P < 0.01). Dietary treatments didn't affect body weight,  balance, and  intake partitioning into milk, maintenance and body tissues (P > 0.1). In the HRUFA experiment, HRUFA-SA had 1.4 kg/d more DMI (P = 0.03) but similar milk and milk components yields (P > 0.1). HRUFA-SA had a tendency to gain more body weight (P = 0.07) and had more positive  balance (P = 0.01) and decreased gross feed efficiency (milk yield / DMI) (P = 0.01). Consistently, HRUFA-S increased intake  partitioning into body tissues (P = 0.02) and decreased  partitioning into milk (P = 0.01). In summary, SA supplementation had more DMI relative to OA, but the effects on milk and milk fat production were different and affected by the level of RUFA in the basal diet. In application, SA supplementation was more effective to improve milk production when included in the basal diet with the low RUFA.© The Author(s) 2019.

Although its toxicity has been thoroughly studied at high concentrations, there is still insufficient knowledge on possible alterations of cell function at subtoxic concentrations, which are in fact more representative concentrations of intoxication scenarios. In this study, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics approach was used to investigate the metabolic changes in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH) exposed to two subtoxic concentrations of MDMA (LC and LC) for 24 h. Metabolomic profiling of both intracellular metabolites and volatile metabolites in the extracellular medium of PMH was performed. Multivariate analysis showed that the metabolic pattern of cells exposed to MDMA discriminates from the controls in a concentration-dependent manner. Exposure to LC MDMA induces a significant increase in some intracellular metabolites, including  and palmitic , and a decrease in glutamate, aspartate, 5-oxoproline, fumarate, malate, phosphoric , α-ketoglutarate and citrate. Extracellular metabolites such as acetophenone, formaldehyde, pivalic , glyoxal and 2-butanone were found significantly increased after exposure to MDMA, compared to controls, whereas 4-methylheptane, 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene, nonanal, among others, were found significantly decreased. The panel of discriminatory metabolites is mainly involved in tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle, fatty  metabolism, glutamate metabolism, antioxidant defenses and possibly changes in the liver enzyme machinery. Overall, these results highlight the potential of the intra- and extracellular metabolome to study alterations triggered by subtoxic concentrations of MDMA in hepatic cell functions, which represents a more realistic appraisal of early toxicity events posed by exposure to this drug. In addition, these results also revealed some metabolites that may be used as potential biomarkers indicative of early events in the hepatotoxicity induced by MDMA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31044193>Design of novel lanthanide-doped core-shell nanocrystals with dual up-conversion and down-conversion luminescence for anti-counterfeiting printing.</a></h2><p>Development of advanced luminescent nanomaterials and technologies is of great significance for anti-counterfeiting applications in global economy, security, and human health, but has proved to be a great challenge. In this work, we design, synthesize, and characterize mono-disperse, dumbbell-shaped lanthanide-doped NaYF@NaGdF core-shell nanoparticles (CSNPs) with dual-mode fluorescence by coating the NaGdF:Ln' shell onto NaYF:Ln core nanospheres via a two-step  mediated thermal decomposition process. Different from the conventional synthesis method to produce spherical nanoparticles, the epitaxial growth of the NaGdF:Ln' shell onto the nanosphere cores and the lattice mismatch between β-NaGdF and β-NaYF nanocrystals enable the formation of dumbbell-shaped CSNPs, as evidenced by the morphological evolution of CSNPs and as explained by the Ostwald ripening growth mechanism. By tailoring different doped lanthanide ions in the core and the shell, the resultant CSNPs exhibit tunable but different up-/down-conversion luminescence under the irradiation of a 980 nm laser and 254 nm UV light, respectively.

Twenty-four mid-lactation multiparous Holstein cows were used in a split-plot Latin square design. Cows were allocated to a main plot receiving either a basal diet with soyhulls (SH, n = 12) or a basal diet with whole cottonseed (CS, n = 12) that was fed throughout the experiment. Within each plot a 4 × 4 Latin square arrangement of treatments was used in 4 consecutive 21-d periods. Treatments were (1) control (CON; no supplemental fat), (2) high C16:0 supplement [PA; fatty  (FA) supplement blend provided ∼80% C16:0], (3) C16:0 and C18:0 supplement (PA+SA; FA supplement blend provided ∼40% C16:0 + ∼40% C18:0), and (4) C16:0 and cis-9 C18:1 supplement (PA+OA; FA supplement blend provided ∼45% C16:0 + ∼35% cis-9 C18:1). Interactions between basal diets and FA treatments were observed for dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield. Among the SH diets, PA and PA+SA increased DMI compared with CON and PA+OA treatments, whereas in the CS diets PA+OA decreased DMI compared with CON. The PA, PA+SA, and PA+OA treatments increased milk yield compared with CON in the SH diets. The CS diets increased milk fat yield compared with the SH diets due to the greater yield of de novo and preformed milk FA. The PA treatment increased milk fat yield compared with CON, PA+SA, and PA+OA due to the greater yield of mixed-source (16-carbon) milk FA. The PA treatment increased 3.5% fat-corrected milk compared with CON and tended to increase it compared with PA+SA and PA+OA. The CS diets increased body weight (BW) change compared with the SH diets. Additionally, PA+OA tended to increase BW change compared with CON and PA and increased it in comparison with PA+SA. The PA and PA+OA treatments increased dry matter and neutral detergent fiber digestibility compared with PA+SA and tended to increase them compared with CON. The PA+SA treatment reduced 16-carbon, 18-carbon, and total FA digestibility compared with the other treatments. The CS diets increased  partitioning toward body reserves compared with the SH diets. The PA treatment increased  partitioning toward milk compared with CON and PA+OA and tended to increase it compared with PA+SA. In contrast, PA+OA increased  partitioned to body reserves compared with PA and PA+SA and tended to increase it compared with CON. In conclusion, milk yield responses to different combinations of FA were affected by the addition of whole cottonseed in the diet. Among the combinations of C16:0, C18:0, and cis-9 C18:1 evaluated, fat supplements with more C16:0 increased  output in milk, whereas fat supplements with more cis-9 C18:1 increased  storage in BW. The combination of C16:0 and C18:0 reduced nutrient digestibility, which most likely explains the lower performance observed compared with other treatments.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

The direct role of ApoA-1 in liver regeneration was studied in mouse hepatectomy model in vivo and hepatocytes in vitro.Compared to small-for-size normal graft, decreased expression of ApoA-1 associated with delayed regeneration were detected in small-for-size fatty liver graft after transplantation. In functional study, the expression of ApoA-1 was decreased in hepatocytes with steatosis and was inversely associated with the concentration of . The ApoA-1 administration effectively attenuated hepatocytes steatosis and accelerated hepatocytes proliferation.

To understand the physiological and molecular mechanisms through which Lb. casei GCRL163 adapts to persistent elevated temperature, label-free quantitative proteomics of cell-free extracts was used to characterize the global responses of the strain cultured anaerobically in bioreactors at 30 to 45°C, pH 6.5, together with GC-MS for fatty  methyl ester analysis at different growth phases. At higher growth temperatures, repression of -consuming metabolic pathways, such as fatty , nucleotide and amino  biosynthesis, was observed, while PTS- and ABC-type transporter systems associated with uptake of nitrogen and carbon sources were up-regulated. Alkaline shock protein Asp23_2 was only detected at 45°C, expressed at high abundance, and presumptive α-L-fucosidase only at 40 and 45°C, with highly increased abundance (log2-fold change of 7) at 45°C. We identified a novel SecB homolog as a protein export chaperone putatively involved in posttranslational translocation systems, which was down-regulated as growth temperature increased and where the modelled 3D-structure shared architectural similarities with the Escherichia coli SecB protein. Membrane lipid analyses revealed temporal changes in fatty  composition, cyclization of  to cyclopropane and novel cyclopentenyl moieties, and reduced synthesis of vaccenic , at higher temperatures. An 18kDa α-crystallin domain, Hsp20 family heat shock protein was more highly up-regulated in response to heat stress compared to other molecular chaperones, suggesting this protein could be a useful biomarker of prolonged heat stress in Lb. casei GCRL163.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29507605>High-level accumulation of oleyl oleate in plant seed oil by abundant supply of  substrates to efficient wax ester synthesis enzymes.</a></h2><p>Biotechnology enables the production of high-valued industrial feedstocks from plant seed oil. The plant-derived wax esters with long-chain monounsaturated acyl moieties, like oleyl oleate, have favorite properties for lubrication. For biosynthesis of wax esters using acyl-CoA substrates, expressions of a fatty acyl reductase (FAR) and a wax synthase (WS) in seeds are sufficient.For optimization of the enzymatic activity and subcellular localization of wax ester synthesis enzymes, two fusion proteins were created, which showed wax ester-forming activities in . To promote the formation of oleyl oleate in seed oil, WSs from  (WSD1) and  (WS2), as well as the two created fusion proteins were tested in Arabidopsis to evaluate their abilities and substrate preference for wax ester production. The tested seven enzyme combinations resulted in different yields and compositions of wax esters. Expression of a FAR of  (FAR) with WSD1 or WS2 led to a high incorporation of C substrates in wax esters. The FAR/TMAWAT2-WSD1 combination resulted in the incorporation of more C alcohol and C acyl moieties into wax esters compared with FAR/WSD1. The fusion protein of a WS from  (WS) with MaFAR exhibited higher specificity toward C substrates in preference to C substrates. Expression of FAR/WSD1 in the Arabidopsis  double mutant resulted in the accumulation of oleyl oleate (18:1/18:1) in up to 62 mol% of total wax esters in seed oil, which was much higher than the 15 mol% reached by FAR/WSD1 in Arabidopsis Col-0 background. In order to increase the level of oleyl oleate in seed oil of , lines expressing FAR/WS were crossed with a transgenic high oleate line. The resulting plants accumulated up to >40 mg g seed of wax esters, containing 27-34 mol% oleyl oleate.The overall yields and the compositions of wax esters can be strongly affected by the availability of acyl-CoA substrates and to a lesser extent, by the characteristics of wax ester synthesis enzymes. For synthesis of oleyl oleate in plant seed oil, appropriate wax ester synthesis enzymes with high catalytic efficiency and desired substrate specificity should be expressed in plant cells; meanwhile, high levels of -derived substrates need to be supplied to these enzymes by modifying the fatty  profile of developing seeds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820744>Chemical composition, in vitro gas production, methane production and fatty  profile of canola silage (Brassica napus) with four levels of molasses.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of four levels of molasses on chemical composition, in vitro digestibility, methane production and fatty  profile of canola silages. A canola (Brassica napus var. Monty) crop was established in a small-scale agricultural farm and harvested 148 days after sowing. Four levels of molasses were tested with respect to the fresh weight (1.5 kg); these were 1% (CS-1), 2% (CS-2), 3% (CS-3) and 4% (CS-4) molasses, and 0% molasses (CS-0) was included as a control. A total of 45 microsilages were prepared using PVC pipes (4 in. of diameter × 20 cm of length), and the forage was compressed using a manual press. The effects of control and treatments were tested using the general linear model Y = μ + T + E. The linolenic  (C18:3n3), palmitic  (C16:0) and linoleic  methyl ester (C18:2n6c) accounted for 30%, 21% and 10.5% of total fatty acids, respectively; the fermentation parameters and in vitro methane production were not affected (P > 0.05) by treatments; in vitro digestibility decreased significantly (P < 0.05) as the level of molasses increased. It was concluded that CS-4 improved the DM content by 9% and showed high content of linolenic  methyl ester.

Herein, we introduce a novel route for obtaining Nb-doped TiO anatase films with the [001] preferred orientation by thermal oxidation of the [100]-oriented Nb-doped TiN film prepared by magnetron sputtering. Comprehensive analyses with X-ray diffraction, Raman scattering, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that the proportion of high- (001) facets of the Nb-doped TiO film is more than 90% and the Nb ion is successfully doped into the film without destroying the crystallinity and orientation. Moreover, the Nb ion doping significantly restrains the growth of the TiO grains and increases the surface roughness, and consequently increases the surface-reactive sites. Therefore, the as-fabricated Nb-doped TiO film exhibits efficient photocatalytic oxidation performance for acetaldehyde and  decomposition under simulated solar light irradiation. Such Nb-doped TiO anatase films with high-reactivity (001) facet exposure may find applications in the photocatalysis and solar  conversion fields.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30563792>Enhanced lipid extraction from oleaginous yeast biomass using ultrasound assisted extraction: A greener and scalable process.</a></h2><p>Soaring demand for alternative fuels has been gaining wide interest due to depletion of conventional fuel, increasing petroleum prices and greenhouse gas emissions. Biodiesel, an alternative fuel, derived from oleaginous microbes has been promising because of short incubation time and easy to scale up. Oleaginous yeast Trichosporon sp. is capable of utilizing glycerol and agro-residues for enhanced lipid synthesis. Lipid extraction from Trichosporon sp. biomass showed highest lipid content with ultrasonic assisted extraction (43 ± 0.33%, w/w) coupled with process parameters than the conventional Soxhlet (30 ± 0.28%, w/w) and Binary solvent [choloroform:methanol, (2:1, v/v)] methods (36 ± 0.38%, w/w), respectively. The standardized process parameters of ultrasonic assisted extraction coupled with chloroform/methanol solvent system resulted 95-97% of conversion efficiency in 20 min at 30 °C with a frequency of 50 Hz and 2800 W power, respectively. Enzymatic transesterification of yeast biomass lipid obtained 85% of fatty  methyl esters that are predominant with  methyl ester followed by palmitic and stearic  methyl esters, respectively. These results substantiate that the ultrasonic assisted extraction is a potential green extraction technique that had reduced time,  and solvent consumption without compromising on lipid quality. Deploying this green extraction technique could make the biodiesel production process inexpensive and eco-friendly.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Such knowledge, particularly the impact of ligand dynamics on physical behavior of NPSLs, is still in its infancy. Here, we combine coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, and small angle X-ray scattering experiments in a diamond anvil cell to demonstrate that coverage density of capping ligands (i.e., number of ligands per unit area of a nanoparticle's surface), strongly influences the structure, elasticity, and high-pressure behavior of NPSLs using face-centered cubic PbS-NPSLs as a representative example. We demonstrate that ligand coverage density dictates (a) the extent of diffusion of ligands over NP surfaces, (b) spatial distribution of the ligands in the interstitial spaces between neighboring NPs, and (c) the fraction of ligands that interdigitate across different nanoparticles. We find that below a critical coverage density (1.8 nm-2 for 7 nm PbS NPs capped with ), NPSLs collapse to form disordered aggregates via sintering, even under ambient conditions. Above the threshold ligand coverage density, NPSLs surprisingly preserve their crystalline order even under high applied pressures (∼40-55 GPa), and show a completely reversible pressure behavior. This opens the possibility of reversibly manipulating lattice spacing of NPSLs, and in turn, finely tuning their collective electronic, optical, thermo-mechanical, and magnetic properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31459082>Effect of Surface Functionalization and Physical Properties of Nanoinclusions on Thermal Conductivity Enhancement in an Organic Phase Change Material.</a></h2><p>We probe the role of surface functionalization and physical properties of nanoinclusions in thermal conductivity enhancement during liquid-solid phase transition in a hexadecane-based phase change material (PCM). Hexadecane-based PCM is loaded with six different nanoinclusions: carbon black nanopowder (CBNP), nickel nanoparticles (NiNPs), copper nanoparticles, silver nanowires (AgNWs), multiwalled carbon nanotubes, and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs). The nanoinclusions CBNP, NiNP, AgNW, and GNP are surface-functionalized with . Nanoinclusion-loaded PCM showed a large enhancement in thermal conductivity, which was more prominent in the solid state. Interestingly, a maximum thermal conductivity enhancement of ∼122% was observed in the solid state for the PCM loaded with 0.01 wt % CBNP. Higher thermal conductivity enhancement in the solid state is attributed to the formation of a nanocrystalline network structure during freezing of the PCM, consisting of a needlelike microstructure, which is confirmed by optical phase contrast microscopy. During solidification, the nanoinclusions are driven toward the grain boundaries, thereby forming a quasi-two-dimensional network of percolating structures with high thermal transport efficiency due to the enhancement of phonon-mediated heat transfer and near-field radiative heat transfer. Thermal conductivity increases with the increased loading of the nanoinclusions due to the formation of more interconnecting aggregates. Among the carbon-based nanoinclusions, the highest thermal conductivity enhancement is obtained for the PCM loaded with CBNP, which is attributed to the low fractal dimensions and volume-filling capability of CBNP aggregates. In the case of metallic nanoinclusions, the highest thermal conductivity enhancement is obtained for the PCM loaded with AgNW, which is due to the large aspect ratio of AgNW. The carboxylic group of  attached to the nanoinclusions is found to provide better steric stability with insignificant aggregation and improved thermal stability, which are beneficial for practical applications. Our results indicate that the initial thermal conductivity of carbon-based nanoinclusions has an insignificant role in the thermal conductivity enhancement of the PCM but the volume-filling capability of the nanoinclusion has a prominent role. The findings from the present study will be beneficial for tailoring the properties of nanoinclusion-loaded organic PCM for thermal  storage and reversible thermal switching applications at room temperature.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586741>New mild amphoteric sulfohydroxybetaine-type surfactants containing different labile spacers: Synthesis, surface properties and performance.</a></h2><p>The excellent performance of zwitterionic alkylamide-type surfactants may be tuned by slight modifications of their structures, especially concerning linking groups between hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties and the moderation of strong NH hydrogen bonds via the introduction of a methyl group attached to the nitrogen.The influence of the structure of alkylamidehydroxysulfobetaine-type surfactants on their adsorption and micellization, lime soap dispersing ability, wettability, as well as antimicrobial and hemolytic activities was studied in this work. We synthesized a series of novel surfactants with labile CON(Me)CH or CHN(Me) CO spacers that were adjacent to the hydrophobic tail CH and separated from the zwitterionic hydroxysulfobetaine headgroup by CH or CH linkers, i.e., [(3-alkanoyilomethyoamine)propyl] dimethylammonium 2-hydroxypropanesulfonates (CTMDAS) and [3-(alkylmetyloamino)-3-oxopropyl] dimethylammonium 2-hydroxypropanesulfonates (CDMPAS), respectively.The CTMDAS surfactants showed slightly higher surface activity and lower CMC than the respective CDMPAS with the same number of carbon atoms. Moreover, the CTMDAS series exhibited significantly higher lime soap dispersing abilities and softer interactions with biological systems than CDMPAS. The molecular modeling computations revealed that the difference in surface activity originated from lower dipole moment of CTMDAS, hence, lower polarity, whereas higher free  of dimerization of those surfactants with  may account for the favorable formation of mixed micelles.Copyright © 2019.

Our previous study demonstrated that when compared with aspartame (Asp), 2 wk of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS)-sweetened beverages provided at 25% of daily  requirement was associated with increased body weight, postprandial (pp) triglycerides (TG), and fasting and pp CVD risk factors in young adults. The fatty  ethanolamide, anandamide (AEA), and the monoacylglycerol, 2-arachidonoyl- sn-glycerol (2-AG), are two primary endocannabinoids (ECs) that play a role in regulating food intake, increasing adipose storage, and regulating lipid metabolism. Therefore, we measured plasma concentrations of ECs and their analogs, oleoylethanolamide (OEA), docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA), and docosahexaenoyl glycerol (DHG), in participants from our previous study who consumed HFCS- or Asp-sweetened beverages to determine associations with weight gain and CVD risk factors. Two-week exposure to either HFCS- or Asp-sweetened beverages resulted in significant differences in the changes in fasting levels of OEA and DHEA between groups after the testing period. Subjects who consumed Asp, but not HFCS, displayed a reduction in AEA, OEA, and DHEA after the testing period. In contrast, there were significant positive relationships between AEA, OEA, and DHEA vs. ppTG, ppApoCIII, and ppApoE in those consuming HFCS, but not in those consuming Asp. Our findings reveal previously unknown associations between circulating ECs and EC-related molecules with markers of lipid metabolism and CVD risk after HFCS consumption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29040817>Potential for mcl-PHA production from nonanoic and azelaic acids.</a></h2><p>Greater than 65% of canola and high- soy oil fatty acids is , which is readily converted to nonanoic (NA) and azelaic (AzA) acids by ozonolysis. NA is an excellent substrate for medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (mcl-PHA) production but AzA has few uses. Pseudomonas citronellolis DSM 50332 and Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 17400, both able to produce mcl-PHA from fatty acids and to grow on AzA as the sole source of carbon and , were assessed for the accumulation of mcl-PHA from AzA and NA. In N-limited shake flasks using NA, P. citronellolis produced 32% of its dry biomass as mcl-PHA containing 78% 3-hydroxynonanoate with 22% 3-hydroxyheptanoate. Pseudomonas fluorescens produced only 2% PHA. N-limited P. citronellolis on AzA produced 20% dry weight PHA containing 75% 3-hydroxydecanoate and 25% 3-hydroxyoctanoate, indicative of de novo synthesis. Although selective pressure, including β-oxidation inhibition, under well-controlled (chemostat) conditions was applied to P. citronellolis, no side-chain carboxyl groups were detected. It was concluded that one or more of FabG and PhaJ or the PHA synthase cannot catalyze reactions involving ω-carboxy substrates.

To regulate fatty  desaturation in microalgae, the relationship among nitrate concentration, fatty  composition and the expression levels of desaturase genes was explored. Dynamic variations of fatty  profiles suggested nitrate could induce desaturation of C18 fatty acids. The content of C18:1 in  was 30.88% at 0 g l nitrate concentration compared with 0.48% at 1.5 g l. The expressions of relative delta-9, 12 and 15 fatty  desaturase genes (Δ9, Δ12 and Δ15FADs) were further investigated. The 330% upregulated expression of Δ9FAD in logarithmic phase at 0 g l resulted in C18:1 accumulation. Moreover, nitrate replenishment caused a sharp reduction of C18:1 from 34.79% to 0.22% and downregulation of Δ9FAD expression to 1% of the nitrate absence level, indicating the pivotal role of Δ9FAD in C18:1 accumulation. Finally, overexpression of Δ9FAD in  and  resulted in an increase of C18:1, confirming its ability of desaturating C18:0.

In order to bring new insights into the cellular responses of  after the fermentation arrest during high-temperature ethanol fermentation, quantitative proteomic profiling and integrated analysis with transcriptomic data were performed in this study.Samples collected at 14, 16, 18, 20 and 22 h during high-temperature fermentation were subjected to isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomic profiling and integrated analysis with transcriptomic data. The correlations between transcripts and proteins for the comparative group 16 h vs 14 h accounted for only 4.20% quantified proteins and 3.23% differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), respectively, much higher percentages of correlations (30.56%-59.11%) were found for other comparative groups (i.e., 18 h vs 14 h, 20 h vs 14 h, and 22 h vs 14 h). According to Spearman correlation tests between transcriptome and proteome (the absolute value of a correlation coefficient between 0.5 and 1 indicates a strong correlation), poor correlations were found for all quantified proteins ( = - 0.0355 to 0.0138), DEPs ( = - 0.0079 to 0.0233) and the DEPs with opposite expression trends to corresponding differentially expressed genes (DEGs) ( = - 0.0478 to 0.0636), whereas stronger correlations were observed in terms of the DEPs with the same expression trends as the correlated DEGs ( = 0.5593 to 0.7080). The results of multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) verification indicate that the iTRAQ results were reliable.

The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of theacrine, a rare purine alkaloid isolated from Camellia assamica var. kucha, against acylcarnitine metabolism disorder in NAFLD.The pharmacological activities of theacrine were studied using high-fat diet (HFD)-fed ApoE-/- and C57BL/6J mice models. Oleate-treated HepG2 and L-02 cells were used to investigate the molecular mechanism of theacrine on acylcarnitine metabolism. The target of theacrine was confirmed in vitro as the blockade of sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and protein kinase A.Theacrine inhibits hepatic steatosis and liver inflammation and improves  expenditure in HFD-fed mice. Theacrine ameliorates acylcarnitine metabolism disorder in HFD-fed mice and oleate-treated hepatocytes by improving fatty  oxidation. The underlying mechanism involves theacrine's activation of the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 and consequently, the increased activity of long-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (LCAD) through deacetylation.Theacrine promotes acylcarnitine metabolism in NAFLD through the SIRT3/LCAD signaling pathway.

Moreover, regenerated peripheral nerves often do not reach normal functionality. Here, we investigated cardiolipin in the process of neuro-differentiation, since cardiolipin is closely linked to the mitochondrial  supply in cells. The NSC-34 hybrid cell line, produced by fusing neuroblastoma cells with primary spinal cord motor neurons, was used, since it shares several morphological and physiological characteristics with mature primary motor neurons. Their neuro-differentiation was supported by switching from normal to differentiation medium or by fatty  supplementation. Differentiation was evaluated by measuring neurite-sprouting parameters and PPARα expression. Cellular fatty  distribution was analyzed to indicate changes in lipid metabolism during differentiation. Cardiolipin was characterized by acyl-chain composition and the distribution of molecular cardiolipin species. Both, the switch from normal to differentiation medium as well as the administration of palmitic and  promoted neuro-differentiation. Stimulated differentiation was accompanied by changes in cardiolipin content and composition. The positive correlation between neuro-differentiation and concentration of those molecular cardiolipin species containing palmitic and  implied a link between differentiation of NSC-34 cells and cardiolipin metabolism. We further demonstrated the impact of cellular lipid metabolism, and particularly cardiolipin metabolism, during and NSC-34 neuritogenesis. Thus, cardiolipin may represent a new therapeutic target for axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injuries or when axon sprouting is required to compensate for motor neuron loss in response to aging and/or disease.Copyright © 2019 IBRO.

Using the Seahorse XF96 analyzer, the energetic phenotypes of Electron Transport Chain (ETC) complex mutants are further characterized in the current study. The underlying regulation of energetic changes in these mutants is determined in glucose and non-glucose conditions when compared to wild type (WT) cells. In parental cells, the rate of oxygen consumption remains constant for 2.5 h following the addition of glucose, oligomycin, and 2-DG, but glycolysis is highly active upon the addition of glucose. In comparison, over the same time period, electron transport complex mutants (CI, CIII and CIV) have heightened activities in both oxygen consumption and glycolysis upon glucose uptake. We refer to the response in these mutants as an "explosive respiration," which we believe is caused by low  levels and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Accompanying this phenotype in mutants is a hyperphosphorylation of Snf1p which in Saccharomyces cerevisiae serves as an energetic stress response protein kinase for maintaining  homeostasis. Compared to wild type cells, a 2.9- to 4.4-fold hyperphosphorylation of Snf1p is observed in all ETC mutants in the presence of glucose. However, the explosive respiration and hyperphosphorylation of Snf1 can be partially reduced by the replacement of glucose with either glycerol or  in a mutant-specific manner. Furthermore, Inhibitors of glutathione synthesis (BSO) or anti-oxidants (mito-TEMPO) likewise confirmed an increase of Sfn1 phosphorylation in WT or mutant due to increased levels of ROS. Our data establish the role of the C. albicans Snf1 as a surveyor of cell  and ROS levels. We interpret the "explosive respiration" as a failed attempt by ETC mutants to restore  and ROS homeostasis via Snf1 activation. An inherently high OCR baseline in WT C. albicans with a background level of Snf1 activation is a prerequisite for success in quickly fermenting glucose.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the fast technical development in the production of aviation fuels, there are still several shortcomings such as a high cost of raw materials, a low yield of aviation fuels, and poor process techno-economic consideration. In recent years, olefin metathesis has become a powerful and versatile tool for generating new carbon-carbon bonds. The cross-metathesis reaction, one kind of metathesis reaction, has a high potential to efficiently convert plant oil into valuable chemicals, such as α-olefin and bio-aviation fuel by combining with a hydrotreatment process.In this research, an efficient, four-step conversion of plant oil into bio-aviation fuel and valuable chemicals was developed by the combination of enzymatic transesterification, olefin cross-metathesis, and hydrotreating. Firstly, plant oil including oil with poor properties was esterified to fatty  methyl esters by an enzyme-catalyzed process. Secondly, the fatty  methyl esters were partially hydrotreated catalytically to transform poly-unsaturated fatty  such as linoleic  into . The olefin cross-metathesis then transformed the  methyl ester (OAME) into 1-decene and 1-decenoic  methyl ester (DAME). The catalysts used in this process were prepared/selected in function of the catalytic reaction and the reaction conditions were optimized. The carbon efficiency analysis of the new process illustrated that it was more economically feasible than the traditional hydrotreatment process.A highly efficient conversion process of plant oil into bio-aviation fuel and valuable chemicals by the combination of enzymatic transesterification, olefin cross-metathesis, and hydrotreatment with prepared and selected catalysts was designed. The reaction conditions were optimized. Plant oil was transformed into bio-aviation fuel and a high value α-olefin product with high carbon utilization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28679273>Acoustic radiation force on a fluid cylindrical particle immersed in water near an impedance boundary.</a></h2><p>This work presents a theoretical model to calculate the acoustic radiation force of a fluid cylindrical particle immersed in water near a boundary. A solution of the acoustic radiation force function, which is the radiation force per unit  density and unit cross-sectional surface area, is derived for a cylinder near a boundary in normal incident plane wave by applying the translation addition theorem of cylindrical function. The effects of impedance boundary on acoustic radiation force of a fluid  cylinder and a mixture fluid cylinder immersed in water are analyzed with particular emphasis on the radius of fluid cylinder and the distance from its center to the impedance boundary. The results reveal that the existence of particle trapping behavior depends on the choice of the nondimensional frequency ka as well as the offset distance from the impedance boundary. This study provides a theoretical basis for acoustic manipulation, which may be of benefit to the improvement and development of the acoustic control technology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635132>New Method of Analysis of Lipids in  (Herbst) and  (Fabricius) Insects by Direct Immersion Solid-Phase Microextraction (DI-SPME) Coupled with GC-MS.</a></h2><p>Lipids play an essential role in providing  and other physiological functions for insects. Therefore, it is important to determine the composition of insect lipids from cuticular and internal tissues for a better understanding of insect biology and physiology. A novel non-derivatization method for the analysis of lipids including fatty acids, hydrocarbon waxes, sterols in  (Herbst) and  (Fabricius) was explored using the direct immersion solid-phase microextraction (DI-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Nine extraction solvents, acetonitrile, methanol, hexane, ethanol, chloroform, acetonitrile and ethanol (1:1 /), acetonitrile and water (1:1 /), ethanol and water (1:1 /) and acetonitrile and ethanol and water (2:2:1 //) were selected and evaluated for the extraction of insect lipids with DI-SPME fiber. Acetonitrile extraction offered the best qualitative, quantitative, and number of lipids extracted from insects samples results. Acetonitrile extracted high-boiling point compounds from both species of tested insects. The range of hydrocarbons was C25 (pentacosane) to C32 (dotriacontane) for  and C26 (11-methylpentacosane) to C34 (tetratriacontane) for . The major compounds extracted from the cuticular surface of  were 11-methylheptacosane (20.71%) and 3-methylheptacosane (12.37%), and from  were 10-methyldotriacontane (14.0%), and 15-methyltritriacontane (9.93%). The limit of detection (LOD) for the n-alkane compounds ranged between 0.08 (nonacosane) and 0.26 (dotriacontane) µg/g and for the fatty acids between 0.65 (arachidic ) to 0.89 () µg/g. The study indicated that DI-SPME GC-MS is a highly efficient extraction and a sensitive analytical method for the determination of non-derivatized insect lipids in cuticular and homogenized body tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31215940>Self-assembly of a robust hydrogen-bonded octylphosphonate network on cesium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals for light-emitting diodes.</a></h2><p>We report the self-assembly of an extensive inter-ligand hydrogen-bonding network of octylphosphonates on the surface of cesium lead bromide nanocrystals (CsPbBr NCs). The post-synthetic addition of octylphosphonic  to /oleylamine-capped CsPbBr NCs promoted the attachment of octylphosphonate to the NC surface, while the remaining oleylammonium ligands maintained the high dispersability of the NCs in non-polar solvent. Through powerful 2D solid-state P-H NMR, we demonstrated that an ethyl acetate/acetonitrile purification regime was crucial for initiating the self-assembly of extensive octylphosphonate chains. Octylphosphonate ligands were found to preferentially bind in a monodentate mode through P-O, leaving polar P[double bond, length as m-dash]O and P-OH groups free to form inter-ligand hydrogen bonds. The octylphosphonate ligand network strongly passivated the nanocrystal surface, yielding a fully-purified CsPbBr NC ink with PLQY of 62%, over 3 times higher than untreated NCs. We translated this to LED devices, achieving maximum external quantum efficiency and luminance of 7.74% and 1022 cd m with OPA treatment, as opposed to 3.59% and 229 cd m for untreated CsPbBr NCs. This represents one of the highest efficiency LEDs obtained for all-inorganic CsPbBr NCs, accomplished through simple, effective passivation and purification processes. The robust binding of octylphosphonates to the perovskite lattice, and specifically their ability to interlink through hydrogen bonding, offers a promising passivation approach which could potentially be beneficial across a breadth of halide perovskite optoelectronic applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31457900>Influence of the Capping Ligand on the Band Gap and Electronic Levels of PbS Nanoparticles through Surface Atomistic Arrangement Determination.</a></h2><p>Lead sulfide (PbS) nanoparticles were synthesized by chemical methods with different sizes and different capping ligands (, myristic , and hexanoic ), avoiding ligand exchange procedures, to study the effect of characteristics of the capping ligands on their  levels and band gap values. Experimental results (UV-vis-NIR, Fourier transform infrared, and Raman spectroscopies, cyclic voltammetry, transmission electron microscopy, and electron  loss spectroscopy) showed a marked influence of the capping ligand nature on the electro-optical properties of PbS nanoparticles with a very similar size. Differences were observed in the atomistic arrangement on the nanoparticle surface and phonon vibrations with the different capping ligands. These observations suggest that the electro-optical properties of PbS nanoparticles are not only determined by their size, through quantum confinement effects, but also strongly affected by the atomistic arrangement on the nanoparticle surface, which is determined by the capping ligand nature.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28895946>DNA-SIP based genome-centric metagenomics identifies key long-chain fatty -degrading populations in anaerobic digesters with different feeding frequencies.</a></h2><p>Fats, oils and greases (FOG) are -dense wastes that can be added to anaerobic digesters to substantially increase biomethane recovery via their conversion through long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). However, a better understanding of the ecophysiology of syntrophic LCFA-degrading microbial communities in anaerobic digesters is needed to develop operating strategies that mitigate inhibitory LCFA accumulation from FOG. In this research, DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) was coupled with metagenomic sequencing for a genome-centric comparison of oleate (C)-degrading populations in two anaerobic codigesters operated with either a pulse feeding or continuous-feeding strategy. The pulse-fed codigester microcosms converted oleate into methane at over 20% higher rates than the continuous-fed codigester microcosms. Differential coverage binning was demonstrated for the first time to recover population genome bins (GBs) from DNA-SIP metagenomes. About 70% of the C-enriched GBs were taxonomically assigned to the Syntrophomonas genus, thus substantiating the importance of Syntrophomonas species to LCFA degradation in anaerobic digesters. Phylogenetic comparisons of C-enriched GBs showed that phylogenetically distinct Syntrophomonas GBs were unique to each codigester. Overall, these results suggest that syntrophic populations in anaerobic digesters can have different adaptive capacities, and that selection for divergent populations may be achieved by adjusting reactor operating conditions to maximize biomethane recovery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29131231>A strain-induced exciton transition  shift in CdSe nanoplatelets: the impact of an organic ligand shell.</a></h2><p>We study the influence of surface passivating ligands on the optical and structural properties of zinc blende CdSe nanoplatelets. Ligand exchange of native  with aliphatic thiol or phosphonic  on the surface of nanoplatelets results in a large shift of exciton transition  for up to 240 meV. Ligand exchange also leads to structural changes (strain) in the nanoplatelet's core analysed by wide-angle X-ray diffraction. By correlating the experimental data with theoretical calculations we demonstrate that the exciton  shift is mainly caused by the ligand-induced anisotropic transformation of the crystalline structure altering the well width of the CdSe core. Further the exciton reduced mass in these CdSe quantum wells is determined by a new method and this agrees well with the expected values substantiating that ligand-strain induced changes in the colloidal quantum well thickness are responsible for the observed spectral shifts. Our findings are important for theoretical modeling of other anisotropically strained systems and demonstrate an approach to tune the optical properties of 2D semiconductor nanocrystals over a broad region thus widening the range of possible applications of AB nanoplatelets in optics and optoelectronics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29704984>Antibacterial activity of extracted bioactive molecules of Schinus terebinthifolius ripened fruits against some pathogenic bacteria.</a></h2><p>The aim of this work is to identify the chemical constituents and the bioactivity of essential oil (EO), acetone extract (ACE) and n-hexane extract (HexE) of S. terebinthifolius ripened fruits using GC-MS. Total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of extracts were determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assays, respectively. The toxicity against the growth of Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus flavus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Sarcina lutea, and Staphylococcus aureus was determined with measuring the inhibition zones (IZs) using the disc diffusion method at the concentrations from 125 to 2000 μg/mL, also, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) using 96-well micro-plates and ranged from 4 to 2000 μg/mL. The major components in EO were α-pinene (36.9%), and α-phellandrene (32.8%). The major components in ACE were  (38.7%), α-phellandrene (13.33%), and δ-cadinene (11.1%), while the major methyl esters of fatty acids detected in HexE were  (12.8%), and palmitic (10.9%). The EO showed good activity against the growth of Staph. aureus and P. aeruginosa with MIC values of 16 μg/mL and 32 μg/mL, the ACE showed broad activity against the studied bacterial pathogens with MIC values ranged from of 4-128 μg/mL against the studied bacterial isolates, while HexE, however, showed weak antibacterial activity.

Ultrasound pretreatment is a mechanical cell disruption method that has been shown to enhance lipid recovery from algae due to cavitation effects that disrupt algae cell walls. In this study, a locally grown mixture of Chlorella vulgaris/Cyanobacteria leptolyngbya was sonicated in an ultrasonic reactor with a clamp-on transducer prior to solvent lipid extraction. This configuration allows for a non-contact delivery method of ultrasonic  with improved operational advantages (no fouling of transducer, continuous operation, and fully scalable design). A central composite design (CCD) was implemented to statistically analyze and evaluate the effect of ultrasonic power (350-750 W) and treatment time (5-30 min) on lipid yield. Lipid recovery was found to increase with both ultrasonic power and treatment time. Total lipid yields (on dry biomass basis) extracted via the Bligh and Dyer method from Chlorella vulgaris/cyanobacteria co-culture ranged from 8.3% for untreated algae to 16.9% for algae sonicated with 750 W power for 30 min, which corresponds to more than a doubling of lipid recovery due to ultrasound pretreatment. Increased power and treatment times were found to increase the degree of cell disruption as observed in the SEM and TEM images after ultrasonic pretreatment. Additionally, hexane (1:1 v/v) was evaluated as an alternative to the standard Bligh & Dyer (2:2:1.8 v/v/v chloroform/methanol/cell suspension) lipid extraction solvent system. On average, the Bligh and Dyer method extracted on average over twice the amount of lipids compared to hexane extraction. The lipid profile of the algae extracts indicates high concentrations of lauric  (12:0), palmitic  (16:0), stearic  (18:0),  (18:1), and linoleic  (18:2). This particular configuration of an ultrasonic system proved to be a viable method for the pretreatment of algae for enhanced lipid yields.

We therefore hypothesized that the appetite-regulating effects of FAs are perturbed in obesity. Ten men with severe obesity [median body mass index (BMI) of 51.0 kg/m (range of 47.9-69.0)] and 10 men without obesity [BMI of 24.6 kg/m (range of 21.7-26.8)] were recruited for a double-blind randomized crossover study. On two occasions, participants were given isocaloric (2,660 kJ) and isovolemic (80 ml) loads of either  (long-chain FA) or olive oil (TG) containing radiolabeled lipid and water markers. Postload scintigraphy, blood sampling, and assessment of appetite were performed for 10 h, after which an ad libitum meal was served. Compared with olive oil,  slowed gastric mean emptying time (GMET) for lipids ( P < 0.001), accelerated orocoecal transit time (OCTT; P = 0.005), increased postload cholecystokinin section ( P < 0.001), and suppressed ad libitum  intake ( P = 0.028) in men with severe obesity, and similar effects were seen in the nonobese group (no group × lipid interactions). However, independent of lipid loads, GMET and OCTT were slower (GMET P = 0.046; GMET P = 0.003; OCTT P = 0.001), and basal and postload secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) was attenuated ( P = 0.045 and P = 0.048, respectively) in men with severe obesity compared with men without obesity. We conclude that the more potent appetite-regulating effects of  versus olive oil are unimpaired in men with severe obesity. However, regardless of lipid formulations, severe obesity is associated with slowed gastrointestinal transit and attenuated GLP-1 secretion.

Human milk composition among lactating women in Latvia, as well as the maternal diet during lactation, has not been sufficiently studied. The aim of this research was to assess dietary habits and macronutrient intake among lactating women in Latvia and to examine the effect of diet on human milk composition. : Research was conducted between November 2016 and December 2017. Mature human milk samples ( = 61) along with a 72h food diary, a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and a questionnaire about maternal and infant characteristics were obtained from voluntary women who were recruited via an invitation published in a social media member group for nursing mothers. Fat content in human milk was determined by LVS ISO 2446:2008, protein content was determined by LVS EN ISO 8968-1:2014, lactose was determined by ISO 22662:2007, and the fatty  profile was analyzed using gas chromatography. Dietary data were evaluated using the Finnish food composition database Fineli, release 19 (3 March 2018). : Median values for fat, protein, and lactose in mature human milk were 4.40%, 1.08%, and 6.52%, respectively. Predominant fatty acids in human milk were  (C18:1 n9), palmitic  (C16:0), and linoleic  (C18:2 n6) at 34.60%, 24.00%, and 11.00% of total fatty acids, respectively. The  elaidic  (C18:1 n9) level was <0.10% in all human milk samples. Significant, positive associations ( < 0.05) were found between maternal dietary intake of linoleic, α-linolenic, docosahexaenoic, total -monounsaturated, total -polyunsaturated, and total n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, the ratio of n-6/n-3, and the level of these fatty acids in human milk. Total  and carbohydrate intake among participants were lower, but total fat, saturated fat, and sugar intake were higher than recommended. Protein, linoleic , and α-linolenic  intake were adequate, but docosahexaenoic  intake was noticeably lower than recommended. Women should be supported with information regarding their nutritional needs during lactation and the possible impact of diet on human milk composition. : Macronutrient (fat, protein, and lactose) content in human milk is not affected by maternal diet.

We evaluated the effects of breed, 24 h fasting, and dietary  source (HO:  versus CH: carbohydrates) on the expression of candidate genes involved in adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and lipolysis in the adipose tissue from Iberian and Duroc growing pigs. The Iberian pigs showed greater feed intake, backfat thickness, and saturated fatty acids (SFA) content in the subcutaneous fat, whereas the Duroc pigs had greater ham weight and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content. In both breeds, the diet induced changes in the fatty  (FA) composition of subcutaneous fat samples. The HO group had higher monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and , and lower SFA than the CH group. Regarding gene expression, breed and feeding status (fasting versus postprandial) had significant effects on gene expression, with quantitative interactions between them, while diet showed negligible effects. In general, adipogenic and lipogenic genes were upregulated in the Iberian pigs and in postprandial samples. In contrast, the expression of lipolytic genes showed complex interaction effects. Our results agree with the phenotypic differences between the Iberian and Duroc breeds and with the inhibition of lipogenesis by fasting. Quantitative interactions between breed and feeding status effects were observed, which indicates a different response to fasting of the two breeds, with the obese Iberian breed showing a more stable expression of lipogenic genes. These results highlight the complexity of lipid metabolism regulation, especially in relation to lipolysis processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31446588>Fatty , chemical, and tissue composition of meat comparing Santa Inês breed sheep and Boer crossbreed goats submitted to different supplementation strategies.</a></h2><p>To compare the fatty  (FA) composition, and chemical and tissue composition of meat, 24 uncastrated males, 12 sheep of the Santa Inês breed, and 12 crossbred goats (F1 Boer × undefined breed) with the weight of 24.3 ± 2.38 kg. The animals were distributed in a randomized block design and treatments were arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial design, two small ruminant species/breed (Boer crossbreed goat × Santa Inês breed sheep), and two supplementation strategies ( × protein ). There was not an interaction between the small ruminant species and the supplementation on average daily gain, tissue composition, chemical composition, or FA profile of the longissimus lumborum muscle. Sheep presented greater weight and yield of fat in the subcutaneous, intermuscular, and total depots than goats, which results in better finishing of the sheep for slaughter. Goat meat presented a lower lipid concentration than sheep meat. The protein- supplementation increased , ΣUFA, ΣMUFA, hypocholesterolemic/ Hypercholesterolemic index, and enzymatic activity Δ9-desaturase C18 and decreased SFA capric  in the muscle when compared with energetic supplementation. In Caatinga biome conditions, Boer crossbreed goats meat has a lower concentration of lipids and a healthier FA composition compared with Santa Inês breed sheep because it has a lower SFA and greater PUFA content, which are sources of n-3 and n-6, which may contribute to the reduction of blood cholesterol (LDL). In addition, protein- supplementation also improved the quality of animal fat compared with supplementation only with the energetic concentrate, regardless of species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29345287>Intermittent calorie restriction enhances epithelial-mesenchymal transition through the alteration of  metabolism in a mouse tumor model.</a></h2><p>The effect of intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) on cancer is controversial. In this study, we examined the effects of ICR and food content in syngeneic BALB/c mice injected with CT26 mouse colon cancer cells. Mice were subjected to 24-h fasting once a week for 4 weeks, and then provided with a control, high-calorie, or trans fatty -rich diet. While ICR resulted in increases in tumor weights, metastasis and in the number of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in the tumors or blood of mice fed the control and high-fat diets, it had no effect on body weight after 4 weeks. In particular, we detected increases in the numbers of CSCs in the tumor or blood on the day after starvation, when food overconsumption was detected. Conversely, continuous calorie restriction had no effect on tumor weight, metastasis, or the number of CSCs in tumors or blood. In the post-starvation period,  metabolism in the tumor was altered from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis/lactate fermentation, with the acquisition of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. Hyperglycemia at the post-starvation period induced the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1, hypoxia-induced factor-1α and Nanog, as well as the phosphorylation of Stat3. Taken together, these findings suggest that ICR induces an increase in the number of CSCs and enhances EMT by promoting the Warburg/Crabtree effect following post-fasting food overconsumption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29886393>Photocatalytic degradation of cooking fume on a TiO-coated carbon nanotubes composite filter.</a></h2><p>A TiO/MWCNTs/AlO/NF (TiO nanoparticles/multi-walled carbon nanotubes /AlO-modified nickel foams) composite filter was prepared through grown of MWCNTs upon AlO-modified nickel foams using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and then coated TiO nanoparticles onto MWCNTs using dip-coating method. The MWCNTs forms a network-like structure on the surface layer of composite filter. The BET surface area of TiO/MWCNTs/AlO/NF composite filter is more than 375 times higher than that of the pristine nickel foam. The degradation performance of oil particles was evaluated. Under optimized reaction conditions, 90% of the  on the filter was decomposed after 25 h. In addition, the effect of reaction temperature and light intensity were studied. Increased reaction temperature and light intensity were found to significantly improve the degradation rate and restrain the formation of refractory product. Furthermore, a parallel reaction kinetic model was adopted for degradation of  on the composite filter. The composite filter can reduces the accumulation of oil particles on the filter and the  consumption of the filter.

Recent studies have indicated that the pomegranate (Punica granatum) seed oil (PSO) has many biologically active components that help in controlling diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. However, its impact on the adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HADMSC) remains unclear. Here we have attempted to study the anti-obesity potential of SHAMstat3pg, a fatty  composite extracted from PSO. It is composed of three dietary fatty acids: punicic  [(9Z,11E,13Z)-9,11,13-Octadecatrienoic ],  [Cis-9-Octadecenoic ], and linoleic  [(9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dienoic ]. In this study, we discuss the impact of the fatty acids on adipogenesis, inflammation, glucose uptake, and mitochondrial ATP production. The impact of SHAMstat3pg on the expression of various obesity-associated protein and mRNA transcripts in HADMSC was also analyzed. The results indicate that exposure to 10 µg/ml of SHAMstat3pg (24 hr) inhibited adipogenesis of HADMSC, ameliorated inflammation, attenuated ATP production, and glucose uptake. Also, the extract favorably regulated the mRNA expression of the studied obesity-associated gene transcripts. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: SHAMstat3pg has the potential to serve as a multi-targeted therapy for the management of obesity. This study demonstrated that the dietary fatty acids inhibited the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes. SHAMstat3pg has also shown to have a favorable impact on the expression of the obesity-linked proteins and genes in HADMSC that are associated with adipogenesis, inflammation, satiety,  intake/expenditure (central and peripheral signaling molecules). The study gives an overview of the vast number of genes impacted by the treatment with SHAMstat3pg paving the way for future studies to demonstrate the exact mode of action of how dietary fatty acids can help manage obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30467782>Hydrothermal Synthesis and Upconversion Properties of About 19 nm ScO: Er, Yb Nanoparticles with Detailed Investigation of the  Transfer Mechanism.</a></h2><p>The ScO: Er, Yb nanoparticles (NPs) with the size of about 19 nm were synthesized by a simple -mediated hydrothermal (HT) process.

In the present study, we demonstrate a novel and robust methodology for the sustainable production of fatty acids from Moringa oleifera Lam oil using lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis (without the presence of emulsifiers or buffer solutions). Seven commercial lipases from Candida rugosa (CRL), Burkholderia cepacia (BCL), Thermomyces lanuginosus (TLL), Rhizopus niveus (RNL), Pseudomonas fluorescens (PFL), Mucor javanicus (MJL), and porcine pancreas (PPL) were used as biocatalysts. Initial screening showed that CRL had the highest hydrolytic activity (hydrolysis degree of 81%). Molecular docking analysis contributed to the experimental results, showing that CRL displays more stable binding free  with  (C18:1), which is the fatty  of highest concentration in Moringa oleifera Lam oil.

The nanoparticles were dispersed into hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) to prepare iron sulphide/HEC nanocomposites. Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis), Photoluminescence (PL), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and  dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to characterize the iron sulphide nanoparticles and corresponding HEC nanocomposites. The absorption spectra studies revealed that the nanoparticles were blue shifted due to quantum confinement and the optical band gaps of the nanoparticles are 4.85 eV for FeS1, 4.36 eV for FeS2, and 4.77 eV for FeS3. The emission maxima are red-shifted and broader for the nanoparticles prepared from phenyldithiocarbamate. Rod-like and spherically shaped iron sulphide particles were observed from the HRTEM images.

Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) provides the staple food with serving as main source of  and protein. Germination of sorghum generally increases the nutritive value of seeds and the effects of germination on lipids composition of seeds vary greatly with processing conditions. Therefore, the current study was conducted to compare the effect of emerging processing techniques such as ultrasound (US) and microwave (MW) on fatty acids composition and oil yield of sorghum seeds before and after germination.Initially sorghum grains were soaked with 5% NaOCl (sodium hypochlorite) for surface sterilization. Afterwards, grains were soaked in excess water for 22 h at room temperature and were divided into four portions. The first portion (100 g grains) was subjected to germination without applying any microwave and ultrasonic treatment (T). Second portion was further divided into four groups (T, T, T, T) (100 g of each group) and grains were subjected to ultrasonic treatments using two different ultrasonic intensities (US: 40%; US: 60%) within range of 0-100% and with two different time durations (t: 5 min; t: 10 min) at constant temperature. Third portion was also divided into four groups (T, T, T, T) (100 g of each group) and exposed to microwave treatments at two different power levels (MW: 450 watt; MW: 700 watt) within the range of 100-900 W for two different time durations (t: 15 s; t: 30s). Similarly, fourth portion was divided into four groups (T, T, T, T) (100 g of each group). Each group was exposed to both MW (MW, MW) (100-900 watt power) & US (US, US) (0-100% intensity) treatments at two different time levels (t, t). Then, germination was carried out and pre-treated raw and pre-treated germinated sorghum grains were analyzed for total oil yield, fatty  composition and unsaturated fatty acids (Un-SFA)/saturated fatty acids (SFA) ratio by gas chromatography.The results revealed that oil yield in sorghum before and after germination ranged from 6.55 to 7.84% and 6.28 to 7.57%, respectively. All the microwave and ultrasound processed samples showed significant difference in oil yield than the raw sorghum grains. The highest tested yield was 7.84 ± 0.31% when combination of microwave power (700 W) and ultrasound intensity (60%) was applied for 30s and 10 min, respectively. The results further demonstrate that the raw sorghum contained palmitic (13.73 ± 0.10%), palmitoleic (0.43 ± 0.02%), stearic (1.07 ± 0.04%),  (37.15 ± 0.10%), linoleic (43.33 ± 0.21%), linolenic (1.55 ± 0.04%), arachidic  (0.13 ± 0.01%) and eicosenoic  (0.37 ± 0.02%), respectively. The highest fatty  percentage for palmitic, stearic and arachidic  was 13.75 ± 0.07%, 1.11 ± 0.09% and 0.15 ± 0.03% at 60% US intensity for 10 min (T), respectively. Maximum amount observed was 1.60 ± 0.09% of linolenic  while amount of eicosenoic  decreased from 0.37 ± 0.02% to 0.31 ± 0.01% after processing. In case of applying combination of microwave and sonication treatments, the change in eicosenoic  increased from 0.35 ± 0.02% to 0.40 ± 0.04% while there was no significant change in other fatty acids. The ungerminated sorghum oil possessed 14.93-15.05% and 82.83-83.12% of SFA and Un-SFA, respectively. After germination, percentage of saturated fatty acids increased (16.4-16.55%) while decreased for unsaturated fatty acids (80.13-80.56%) were noted.The results of the present study conclude that the yield of oil from sorghum grains increased by emerging processing. Fatty  analysis of sorghum oil suggested that pre-treatment strategies will not affect the quality of the oil with respect to essential fatty acids content. Overall, the composition of saturated fatty  in germinated grain is improved than ungerminated grains after processing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31033191>Ultrastable CsPbBr Perovskite Quantum Dot and Their Enhanced Amplified Spontaneous Emission by Surface Ligand Modification.</a></h2><p>The poor stability and aggregation problem of CsPbBr quantum dots (QDs) in air are great challenges for their future practical application. Herein, a simple and effective ligand-modification strategy is proposed by introducing 2-hexyldecanoic  (DA) with two short branched chains to replace  (OA) with long chains during the synthesis process. These two short branched chains not only maintain their colloidal stability but also contribute to efficient radiative recombination. The calculations show that CsPbBr QDs with DA modification (CsPbBr -DA QDs) have larger binding  than CsPbBr QDs with OA (CsPbBr -OA QDs), resulting in significantly enhanced stability. Due to the strong binding  between DA ligands and QDs, CsPbBr -DA QDs exhibit no aggregation phenomenon even after stored in air for more than 70 d, and CsPbBr -DA QDs films can maintain 94.3% of initial PL intensity after 28 d, while in CsPbBr -OA QDs films occurs a rapid degradation of PL intensity. Besides, the enhanced amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) performance of CsPbBr -DA QDs films has been demonstrated under both one- and two-photon laser excitation. The ASE threshold of CsPbBr -DA QDs films is reduced by more than 50% and their ASE photostability is also improved, in comparison to CsPbBr -OA QDs films.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We designed a dual-modal fluorescent/PET fatty  based tracer on commercially available Bodipy-C16, which can be synthesized to its corresponding triglyceride and which combines the benefits of fluorescent and PET imaging.Bodipy-C16 was coupled to 1,3-diolein resulting in Bodipy-triglyceride. Bodipy-C16 and Bodipy-triglyceride compounds were radiolabeled with 18F using an 18F/19F exchange reaction to yield a dual-modal imaging molecule. Uptake of radiolabeled and non-labeled Bodipy-C16 and Bodipy-triglyceride was analyzed by fluorescence imaging and radioactive uptake in cultured adipocytes derived from human brown adipose tissue and white adipose tissue.Bodipy-C16 and Bodipy-triglyceride were successfully radiolabeled and Bodipy-C16 showed high shelf life and blood plasma stability (99% from 0-4 h). The uptake of Bodipy-C16 increased over time in cultured adipocytes, which was further enhanced after beta-adrenergic stimulation with norepinephrine. The uptake of Bodipy-C16 was inhibited by  and CD36 inhibitor sulfosuccinimidyl-oleate. The poor solubility of Bodipy-triglyceride did not allow stability or in vitro experiments.The new developed dual modal fatty  based tracers Bodipy-C16 and Bodipy-triglyceride showed promising results to stimulate further in vivo evaluation and will help to understand brown adipose tissues role in whole body  expenditure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30262139>Conversion of dietary trans-vaccenic  to trans11,cis13-conjugated linoleic  in the rat lactating mammary gland by Fatty  Desaturase 3-catalyzed methyl-end Δ13-desaturation.</a></h2><p>In vitro, the rat Fatty  Desaturase 3 (FADS3) gene was shown to code for an enzyme able to catalyze the unexpected Δ13-desaturation of trans-vaccenic , producing the trans11,cis13-conjugated linoleic  (CLA) isomer. FADS3 may therefore be the first methyl-end trans-vaccenate Δ13-desaturase functionally characterized in mammals, but the proof of this concept is so far lacking in vivo. The present study therefore aimed at investigating further the putative in vivo synthesis of trans11,cis13-CLA from dietary trans-vaccenic  in rodents. During one week of pregnancy and two weeks post-partum, Sprague-Dawley female rats were fed two diets either high (10.0% of fatty acids and 3.8% of  intake) or low (0.4% of fatty acids and 0.2% of  intake) in trans-vaccenic . The trans11,cis13-CLA was specifically detected, formally identified and reproducibly quantified (0.06% of total fatty acids) in the mammary gland phospholipids of lactating female rats fed the high trans-vaccenic -enriched diet. This result was consistent with FADS3 mRNA expression being significantly higher in the lactating mammary gland than in the liver. Although the apparent metabolic conversion is low, this physiological evidence demonstrates the existence of this new pathway described in the lactating mammary gland and establishes the FADS3 enzyme as a reliable mammalian trans-vaccenate Δ13-desaturase in vivo.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, pig embryos have larger amounts of intercellular lipid bilayers than other mammalian species, suggesting that porcine embryos are more dependent on lipid metabolic pathways. The objective of the present study was to detect the effect of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1) on LD formation and to associate these effects with the mRNA abundance of LD formation-related genes (SREBP, ARF1, COPG2, PLD1, and ERK2) in in vitro-produced porcine embryos. To determine the effect of SCD1 on LD formation and related genes, we examined the effects of SCD1 inhibition using CAY10566 (an SCD1 inhibitor, 50 μM) on parthenogenetic embryos. SCD1 inhibition downregulated the mRNA levels of LD formation-related genes and embryo development. Our results revealed that SCD1 functions in the regulation of LD formation via phospholipid formation and embryo development. In addition, we treated parthenogenetic embryos with  (100 μM), which led to a significant increase in the blastocyst formation rate, LD size and number compared to controls. Remarkably, the adverse effects of the SCD1 inhibitor could be counteracted by .

Six rumen-fistulated, second-lactation Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (97 ± 13 d in milk) were randomly assigned to a 6 × 6 Latin square design in which each experimental period consisted of 5 d of continuous abomasal infusion followed by 2 d of rest. A total mixed ration consisting of 42% corn silage, 31% grass silage, and 27% concentrate (dry matter basis) was formulated to meet 100 and 83% of net  and metabolizable protein requirements, respectively, and was fed at 90% of ad libitum intake by individual cow. Abomasal infusion treatments were saline (LMP-C), isoenergetic infusions (digestible  basis) of 1,319 g/d of glucose (LMP-GG), 676 g/d of palm olein (LMP-LG; major fatty  constituents are palmitic, , and linoleic ), or 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-C), or isoenergetic infusions of 1,319 g/d of glucose + 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-GG) or 676 g/d of palm olein + 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-LG). The experiment was conducted in climate respiration chambers to determine  and N balance in conjunction with milk production and composition, nutrient digestibility, and plasma constituents. Infusion of GG and LG decreased dry matter intake, but total gross  intake from the diet plus infusions was not affected by GG or LG. Furthermore, GG or LG did not affect total milk, protein, or lactose yields. Infusing GG or LG at the HMP level did not affect milk production differently than at the LMP level. Infusion of GG stimulated  retention in body tissue, increased plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, decreased lipogenic metabolites in plasma, and decreased milk fat yield and milk  output. Nitrogen intake decreased and milk N efficiency increased in response to GG, and N retention was not affected. Infusion of LG tended to increase metabolizable  intake, increased milk fat yield and milk  output, increased plasma triacylglycerides and long-chain fatty  concentrations, and had no effect on  retention. Infusion of LG decreased N intake but did not affect milk N efficiency or N retention. Compared with the LMP level, the HMP level increased dry matter intake, gross and metabolizable  intake, and total milk, fat, protein, and lactose yields. Milk  output increased at the HMP level, and protein level did not affect total  retention. Heat production increased at the HMP level, but only when GG and LG were infused. The HMP level increased N intake, milk N output, and plasma urea concentration, tended to increase N retention, and decreased milk N efficiency. Regardless of protein level, GG promoted  retention and improved milk N efficiency, but not through increased milk protein yield. Infusion of LG partitioned extra  intake into milk and had no effect on milk N efficiency.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Sixty male and female rats were randomly assigned to control, exhaustive exercise and one-week recovery groups, respectively. The metabolic profiles of plasma were investigated by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and data further underwent orthogonal partial least-squares (OPLS) analysis. The current study found that gender was a significant determinant of the effects of exhaustive exercise on the cortisol, blood urea nitrogen, creatine kinase, and the ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione, whereas, no significant interaction effects between gender and exhaustive exercise were found on the levels of testosterone, malonaldehyde, reduced glutathione, oxidized glutathione and lactic dehydrogenase. In male rats, the altered metabolites within exhaustive exercise included increased tricarboxylic  cycle intermediates (citric , fumaric , butanedioic ), branch-chain amino acids (valine, leucine), fatty acids and metabolite (, linoleic , 3-hydroxybutyric ), phosphate and decreased glucose, lactic , serine, and glutamic . In female rats, the levels of fatty acids and metabolite (linoleic , , arachidonic , 3-hydroxybutyric ), amino acids (valine, leucine, glutamic , 5-oxo-proline, methionine, ornithine), other metabolites urea, myo-inositol and phosphate were increased. The results indicated that exhaustive exercise increased the rates of  metabolism, glucose metabolism, amino  catabolism and fatty  metabolism in male rats, whereas, female rats showed an increased propensity to oxidize lipid and conserve carbohydrate and protein metabolism against physical stress. Disordered urea cycle and inositol metabolism also occurred in female rats with exhaustive exercise. Exhaustive exercise affected the balance of hormone adjustment and caused oxidative stress, subsequent cell membrane damage both in male and female rats. A significant gender-related difference in the metabolic profiles was also found between male and female rats within exhaustive exercise.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29093378>Influence of High Temperature and Duration of Heating on the Sunflower Seed Oil Properties for Food Use and Bio-diesel Production.</a></h2><p>Two important problems for the food industry are oil oxidation and oil waste after frying. Sunflower seed oil is one of the vegetable oils most commonly used in the food industry. Two variables were applied to the low  sunflower seed oil in this work i.e. heating temperature (180-210-240°C) and time of heating (15-30-60-120 minutes), to study from the edible point of view the variations of its physico-chemical properties. After 120 minutes heating at 240°C the following was found: refractive index (1.476), free acidity (0.35%), K232 (2.87), K270 (3.71), antiradical activity (45.90% inhibition), total phenols (523 mg kg), peroxide value (17.00 meq kg), p-anisidine value (256.8) and Totox (271.7), all of which showed a constant deterioration. In relation to the use as a feedstock for bio-diesel production, after 120 minutes heating at 240℃ the following was found:  value 0.70 mg KOH g oil, iodine value 117.83 g I 100 g oil, oil stability index 0.67 h, kinematic viscosity (at 40°C) 77.85 mm s, higher heating value 39.86 MJ kg, density 933.34 kg/m and cetane number 67.04. The parameters studied in this work were influenced, in different ways, by the applied variables. Heating temperature between 180 and 210°C and 120 min heating duration were found to be the most appropriate conditions for sunflower seed oil both from the deep frying point of view and from a subsequent use as feedstock for bio-diesel production. In light of the vegetable oils' International standards for an edible use and for a bio-diesel production, findings of this work can be used to set heating temperature and heating duration to preserve as long possible the physico-chemical properties of a low  sunflower seed oil for both its edible use as a fat during cooking and for its re-use after frying.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30410332>Development of a kojic monooleate-enriched oil-in-water nanoemulsion as a potential carrier for hyperpigmentation treatment.</a></h2><p>Kojic monooleate (KMO) is an ester derived from a fungal metabolite of kojic  with monounsaturated fatty , , which contains tyrosinase inhibitor to treat skin disorders such as hyperpigmentation. In this study, KMO was formulated in an oil-in-water nanoemulsion as a carrier for better penetration into the skin.The nanoemulsion was prepared by using high and low  emulsification technique. D-optimal mixture experimental design was generated as a tool for optimizing the composition of nanoemulsions suitable for topical delivery systems. Effects of formulation variables including KMO (2.0%-10.0% w/w), mixture of castor oil (CO):lemon essential oil (LO; 9:1) (1.0%-5.0% w/w), Tween 80 (1.0%-4.0% w/w), xanthan gum (0.5%-1.5% w/w), and deionized water (78.8%-94.8% w/w), on droplet size as a response were determined.Analysis of variance showed that the fitness of the quadratic polynomial fits the experimental data with -value (2,479.87), a low -value (<0.0001), and a nonsignificant lack of fit. The optimized formulation of KMO-enriched nanoemulsion with desirable criteria was KMO (10.0% w/w), Tween 80 (3.19% w/w), CO:LO (3.74% w/w), xanthan gum (0.70% w/w), and deionized water (81.68% w/w). This optimum formulation showed good agreement between the actual droplet size (110.01 nm) and the predicted droplet size (111.73 nm) with a residual standard error <2.0%. The optimized formulation with pH values (6.28) showed high conductivity (1,492.00 µScm) and remained stable under accelerated stability study during storage at 4°C, 25°C, and 45°C for 90 days, centrifugal force as well as freeze-thaw cycles. Rheology measurement justified that the optimized formulation was more elastic (shear thinning and pseudo-plastic properties) rather than demonstrating viscous characteristics. In vitro cytotoxicity of the optimized KMO formulation and KMO oil showed that IC (50% inhibition of cell viability) value was >100 µg/mL.The survival rate of 3T3 cell on KMO formulation (54.76%) was found to be higher compared to KMO oil (53.37%) without any toxicity sign.

In the present study, mung bean seeds were treated with adenosine triphosphate and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). The metabolomic changes during development of mung beans under different  statuses were investigated. In total, 42 metabolites were identified. Principal component analysis revealed that the featured compounds produced in seeds were , linoleic, and succinic acids. Sugars, including maltose, sucrose, and glucose were related to sprouting. Mung bean seeds utilised diverse  resources and produced higher succinic  content. Sugars and secondary metabolites accumulated in sprouts. Nitrogen, sugar, and amino  metabolism pathways contributed to this physiological process. DNP caused an  deficit, which resulted in the consumption and translation of glucose. Higher contents of other saccharides and amino acids were observed. The transcriptional results further confirmed our metabolic hypothesis.

The purpose of this study was to clarify the cellular uptake and binding processes of free and protein-bound unesterified DHA in retinal pigment epithelial cell (RPE) line ARPE-19 as a model of the human outer blood-retinal barrier and isolated porcine RPE cell fractions. Uptake of free [C]DHA by ARPE-19 cells was saturable with a Michaelis-Menten constant of 283 µM, and was significantly inhibited by eicosapentaenoic , arachidonic , and linoleic , but not by . Further, the uptakes of [C]DHA associated with retinol-binding protein ([C]DHA-RBP), [C]DHA associated with low-density lipoprotein ([C]DHA-LDL) and [C]DHA associated with bovine serum albumin ([C]DHA-BSA) in ARPE-19 cells increased time-dependently at 37°C, and were significantly reduced at 4°C, suggesting the involvement of -dependent transport processes. [C]DHA-LDL uptake by ARPE-19 cells was significantly inhibited by excess unlabeled LDL, but not by an inhibitor of scavenger receptor B type I. Fatty  transport protein (FATP) 2 and 4 mRNAs were expressed in ARPE-19 cells, and [C]DHA uptake was observed in FATP2- and FATP4-expressing Xenopus oocytes. Photo-reactive crosslinking and mass spectrometry analyses identified 65-kDa retinal pigment epithelium-specific protein (RPE65) as a DHA-binding protein in porcine RPE cell membrane fractions. Thus, RPE cells possess multiple cellular transport/binding processes for unesterified DHA, involving at least partly FATP2, FATP4, LDL, RBP, and RPE65.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29031242>Dietary creatine supplementation lowers hepatic triacylglycerol by increasing lipoprotein secretion in rats fed high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have shown that dietary creatine supplementation can prevent lipid accumulation in the liver. Creatine is a small molecule that plays a large role in  metabolism, but since the enzyme creatine kinase is not present in the liver, the classical role in  metabolism does not hold in this tissue. Fat accumulation in the liver can lead to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a progressive disease that is prevalent in humans. We have previously reported that creatine can directly influence lipid metabolism in cell culture to promote lipid secretion and oxidation. Our goal in the current study was to determine whether similar mechanisms that occur in cell culture were present in vivo. We also sought to determine whether dietary creatine supplementation could be effective in reversing steatosis. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a high-fat diet or a high-fat diet supplemented with creatine for 5 weeks. We found that rats supplemented with creatine had significantly improved rates of lipoprotein secretion and alterations in mitochondrial function that were consistent with greater oxidative capacity. We also find that introducing creatine into a high-fat diet halted hepatic lipid accumulation in rats with fatty liver. Our results support our previous report that liver cells in culture with creatine secrete and oxidize more , demonstrating that dietary creatine can effectively change hepatic lipid metabolism by increasing lipoprotein secretion and oxidation in vivo. Our data suggest that creatine might be an effective therapy for NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Negative values of Gibbs free  of mixing (ΔG ) were obtained throughout the investigated ranges of the unsaturated C18 fatty- (L1, L2 and L3) mixed systems, indicating that very strong attractions occurred between molecules in the monolayers. The bend and kink effects from the cis-double bond(s) in the hydrocarbon chain affected the membrane fluidity and molecular packing in the monolayers, which resulted in a greater interaction between unsaturated C18 fatty acids and DP. The most thermodynamically stable mole composition of unsaturated C18 fatty acids to DP was observed at 50:1; this ratio is suggested to be the best mole ratio and will be subsequently used to prepare DP-C18 fatty- nanoliposomes. The presence of cis-double bonds in both hydrocarbon chains of DOPE in DP also created an imperfection in the membrane structure of lipid-drug delivery systems, which is expected to enhance lipid-based systems for antibody conjugation and drug encapsulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28787125>Synthesis and Characterization of Microencapsulated Phase Change Materials with Poly(urea-urethane) Shells Containing Cellulose Nanocrystals.</a></h2><p>The main objective of this study is to develop microencapsulation technology for thermal  storage incorporating a phase change material (PCM) in a composite wall shell, which can be used to create a stable environment and allow the PCM to undergo phase change without any outside influence. Surface modification of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) was conducted by grafting poly(lactic ) oligomers and  to improve the dispersion of nanoparticles in a polymeric shell. A microencapsulated phase change material (methyl laurate) with poly(urea-urethane) (PU) composite shells containing the hydrophobized cellulose nanocrystals (hCNCs) was fabricated using an in situ emulsion interfacial polymerization process. The encapsulation process of the PCMs with subsequent interfacial hCNC-PU to form composite microcapsules as well as their morphology, composition, thermal properties, and release rates was examined in this study. Oil soluble Sudan II dye solution in methyl laurate was used as a model hydrophobic fill, representing other latent fills with low partition coefficients, and their encapsulation efficiency as well as dye release rates were measured spectroscopically in a water medium. The influence of polyol content in the PU polymer matrix of microcapsules was investigated. An increase in polyol contents leads to an increase in the mean size of microcapsules but a decrease in the gel content (degree of cross-linking density) and permeability of their shell structure. The encapsulated PCMs for thermal  storage demonstrated here exhibited promising performance for possible use in building or paving materials in terms of released heat, desired phase transformation temperature, chemical and physical stability, and concrete durability during placement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30417908>Optimising the magnetic performance of Co ferrite nanoparticles via organic ligand capping.</a></h2><p>Ferrofluids of CoFeO nanoparticles are gaining increasing interest due to their enhanced heating performance in biomedical applications (e.g. in magnetic hyperthermia as mediators for cancer treatment) or in  applications (e.g. magneto-thermo-electric applications).

The high brightness is realized at high current density (). However, at high , the efficiency drops significantly, thereby limiting the achievable brightness. This notorious phenomenon has been known as efficiency roll-off, which is likely caused by the Auger- and/or thermal-induced emission quenching. In this work, we show that the Joule heat generated during device operation significantly affects the roll-off characteristics of QLEDs. To realize ultrabright and efficient QLEDs, the thermal stability of QDs is improved by replacing the conventional  ligands with 1-dodecanethiol. By further using a substrate with high thermal conductivity, the Joule heat generated at high  is effectively dissipated. Because of the effective thermal management, thermal-induced emission quenching is significantly suppressed, and consequently, the QLEDs exhibit a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 16.6%, which is virtually droop-free over a wide range of brightness (.., EQE = 16.1% @ 10 cd/m and 140 mA/cm). Moreover, due to the reduced efficiency roll-off and enhanced heat dissipation, the demonstrated QLEDs can be operated at a very high  up to 3885 mA/cm, thus enabling the devices to exhibit a record-high brightness of 1.6 × 10 cd/m and a lumen density of 500 lm/cm.

Nifedipine exposure induced a vast accumulation of cytosolic free fatty acids (FFA) and stimulated the production of reactive oxygen species, upregulated CD36 and KIM-1 (kidney injury molecule-1) expression, inhibited p-AMPK activity, and triggered the expression of SREBP-1/2 and lipin-1, underscoring the potential of nifedipine to induce lipotoxicity with renal damage.

In the absence of surfactant, tristearin acyl chains are marginally aligned normal to the interface. The surfactant glycerol monooleate (GMO), a common small-molecule monoacylglycerol (MW: 357 g/mol), preferentially adsorbs to the oil-water interface, displacing more of the tristearin as its concentration increases. The tristearin that remains at the interface is closely aligned normal to the interface. Adjacent to the interface, bulk tristearin increasingly aligns with its acyl chains entwined with the GMO acyl chain, which also preferentially aligns normal to the interface. In contrast, polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR), a bulkier, polymeric surfactant (MW: 1398 g/mol for a molecule with five monomers), both displaces tristearin from the interface and reduces the alignment of the molecules that remain. We suggest that the similar fatty  moieties of GMO () and tristearin (stearic ) lead to liquid-state association and alignment, the latter of which can then serve as a template onto which tristearin crystals can nucleate. Conversely, by both displacing tristearin from the interface and reducing alignment below that of the surfactant-free system, PGPR eliminates the possibility of tristearin interfacial crystallisation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The article describes the application of cycled microwave power for the rapid synthesis of highly branched pure-phase face-centered cubic crystalline nickel multipod nanostructures with >99% multipod population. By controlling the power delivery to the reaction mixture through cycling, superior control is achieved over the growth kinetics of the metallic nanostructures, allowing formation of multipods consisting of arms with different aspect ratios. The multipod structures are formed under ambient conditions in a simple reaction system composed of nickel acetylacetonate (Ni(acac)), oleylamine (OAm), and  (OAc) in a matter of minutes by selective heating at the (111) overgrowth corners on Ni nanoseeds. The selective heating at the corners leads to accelerated autocatalytic growth along the ⟨111⟩ direction through a "lightning rod" effect. The length is proprtional to the length and number of microwave (MW)-on cycles, whereas the core size is controlled by continuous MW power delivery. The roles of heating mode (cycling versus variable power versus convective heating) during synthesis of the materials is explored, allowing a mechanism into how cycled microwave  may allow fast multipod evolution to be proposed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29208481>Detection thresholds for four different fatty stimuli are associated with increased dietary intake of processed high-caloric food.</a></h2><p>BMI-specific differences in food choice and  intake have been suggested to modulate taste perception. However, associations between body composition and fat taste sensitivity are controversial. The objective of this study was to examine the association between body composition, dietary intake and detection thresholds of four fatty stimuli (, paraffin oil, canola oil, and canola oil spiked with ) that could be perceived via gustatory and/or textural cues. In 30 participants, fat detection thresholds were determined in a repeated measurements design over twelve days. Weight status was examined by measuring the participants' BMI, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio. The habitual food intake was assessed via several questionnaires and twelve, non-consecutive 24-hour food diaries. In this study, a negative correlation was found between fat detection thresholds and the intake of food rich in vitamins and fibre. Moreover, a positive correlation was identified between the intake of high-fat food and fat detection thresholds. No differences in fat detection thresholds were observed due to variations in BMI or waist-to-hip ratio. These findings indicate that a regular intake of fatty foods might decrease an individuals' perceptual response to fats which might lead to excess fat intake on the long term.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The cold press produced Marula nut meal (MNM2) had higher arginine than the hydraulic filter press produced Marula nut meal (MNM1) and SBM. The meals had similar neutral and  detergent fibre contents. The MNMs had higher phosphorus, magnesium and copper concentrations than SBM. Although the total saturated fatty  proportion was similar across the meals, total monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty  proportions were higher in MNMs and SBM, respectively.  was higher in MNMs than in SBM.The low crude protein content in MNMs compared to SBM is comparable with other conventional dietary protein sources. Thus, the MNMs could be used as protein and  feed ingredients. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30044630>Targeted Ligand-Exchange Chemistry on Cesium Lead Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots for High-Efficiency Photovoltaics.</a></h2><p>The ability to manipulate quantum dot (QD) surfaces is foundational to their technological deployment. Surface manipulation of metal halide perovskite (MHP) QDs has proven particularly challenging in comparison to that of more established inorganic materials due to dynamic surface species and low material formation ; most conventional methods of chemical manipulation targeted at the MHP QD surface will result in transformation or dissolution of the MHP crystal. In previous work, we have demonstrated record-efficiency QD solar cells (QDSCs) based on ligand-exchange procedures that electronically couple MHP QDs yet maintain their nanocrystalline size, which stabilizes the corner-sharing structure of the constituent PbI octahedra with optoelectronic properties optimal for solar  conversion. In this work, we employ a variety of spectroscopic techniques to develop a molecular-level understanding of the MHP QD surface chemistry in this system. We individually target both the anionic (oleate) and cationic (oleylammonium) ligands. We find that atmospheric moisture aids the process by hydrolysis of methyl acetate to generate acetic  and methanol. Acetic  then replaces native oleate ligands to yield QD surface-bound acetate and free . The native oleylammonium ligands remain throughout this film deposition process and are exchanged during a final treatment step employing smaller cations-namely, formamidinium. This final treatment has a narrow processing window; initial treatment at this stage leads to a more strongly coupled QD regime followed by transformation into a bulk MHP film after longer treatment. These insights provide chemical understanding to the deposition of high-quality, electronically coupled MHP QD films that maintain both quantum confinement and their crystalline phase and attain high photovoltaic performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29365255>Probing Anisotropic Surface Properties and Surface Forces of Fluorite Crystals.</a></h2><p>Fluorite is the most important mineral source for producing fluorine-based chemicals and materials in a wide range of engineering and technological applications. In this work, atomic force microscopy was employed, for the first time, to probe the surface interactions and adhesion  of model  (a commonly used surface modification organics for fluorite) molecules on fluorite surfaces with different orientations in both air and aqueous solutions at different pH conditions. Fitted with the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory, the force results during surface approaching demonstrate the anisotropy in the surface charge of different orientations, with the {111} surface exhibiting a higher magnitude of surface charge, which could be attributed to the difference in the atomic composition. The adhesion measured during surface retraction shows that model  molecules have a stronger adhesion with the {100} surface than with the {111} surface in both air and aqueous solutions. The anisotropic adhesion  was analyzed in relation to the surface atom (especially calcium) activity, which was supported by the surface free  results calculated based on a three-probe-liquid method. Each calcium atom on the {100} surface with four dangling bonds is more active than the calcium atom on the {111} surface with only one dangling bond, supported by a larger value of the Lewis  component for the {100} surface. The model  molecules present in the ionic form at pH 9 exhibit a higher adhesion  with fluorite surfaces as compared to their molecular form at pH 6, which was related to the surface activity of different forms. The adhesion  measured in solution is much lower than that in air, indicating that the solvent exerts an important influence on the interactions of organic molecules with mineral surfaces. The results provide useful information on the fundamental understanding of surface interactions and adhesion  of organic molecules on mineral surfaces with different orientations, and the methodology can be extended to many other crystal surfaces in various interfacial processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29378038>Cashew Nut Consumption Increases HDL Cholesterol and Reduces Systolic Blood Pressure in Asian Indians with Type 2 Diabetes: A 12-Week Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>There is increasing evidence that nut consumption decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, there are few data on the health effects of cashew nuts among adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).The study aimed to investigate the effects of cashew nut supplementation on glycemia, body weight, blood pressure, and lipid profile in Asian Indians with T2DM.In a parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial, 300 adults with T2DM [mean ± SD age: 51 ± 9.3 y; body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2): 26.0 ± 3.4; 55% male] were randomly assigned to receive advice to follow a standard diabetic diet (control) or similar advice plus 30 g cashew nuts/d (intervention) for 12 wk. The macronutrient composition of the prescribed diabetic diet was 60-65%  from carbohydrates, 15-25% from fat, and the rest from protein. Differences between groups in changes in anthropometric and biochemical variables were analyzed using linear models with robust variance estimation under an assumed independence working correlation.Participants in the intervention group had a greater decrease in systolic blood pressure from baseline to 12 wk than did controls (-4.9 ± 13.7 compared with -1.7 ± 11.6 mm Hg; P = 0.04) and a greater increase in plasma HDL cholesterol compared with controls (+1.7 ± 5.6 compared with +0.1 ± 4.6 mg/dL; P = 0.01). There were no differences between the groups with respect to changes in body weight, BMI, blood lipid, and glycemic variables. Plasma  concentrations and self-reported dietary intake of nuts, , and monounsaturated fatty acids suggested excellent compliance with the nut consumption.Cashew nut supplementation in Asian Indians with T2DM reduced systolic blood pressure and increased HDL cholesterol concentrations with no deleterious effects on body weight, glycemia, or other lipid variables.

To date, pharmacological research in this area has focused on the endocannabinoid system, metabolic pathways, and biological significance of FAEs; however, limited nutritional studies have been conducted to understand the actions of FAEs on food intake and their role on overall body composition. Therefore, the present study was designed with the hypothesis that high C18:1n9 will attenuate food consumption in golden Syrian male hamsters (n = 105). Moreover, the long-term (two months) effects of feeding hamsters various dietary oil blends, namely, C+S, 25:75 corn oil:n9 safflower oil; F+S, 25:75 flaxseed oil:n6 safflower oil; H+DHA, 85:15 high  canola oil:docosahexaenoic ; H+EPA, 85:15 high  canola oil:eicosapentaenoic ; HOCO, high  canola oil; OO, olive oil; and RC, regular canola oil, on the plasma levels of seven different FAEs and fatty acids (FAs) composition were investigated. A further objective was to characterize the actions of these diets on  expenditure and overall body composition to determine if dietary fatty  (DFA) composition affects diet-induced obesity (DIO). The results show that DFA directly influenced plasma FA and FAE levels, with marked increases (p < 0.05) observed in plasma C18:1n9 levels after HOCO and OO treatments. Correspondingly, the most elevated plasma oleoylethanolamide (OEA) levels were observed with HOCO and OO treatments, which also decreased (p < 0.05) food intake by ∼8% when compared with H+EPA dietary treatment when measured at the endpoint. Diminished food intake subsequent to HOCO and OO feeding may have resulted from increased OEA concentrations, demonstrating the anorexic properties of the high C18:1n9 dietary components. No differences were observed across OO, HOCO, and HOCO diets with omega-3 FA blends in terms of body composition,  expenditure, plasma C18:1n9 levels, or OEA concentrations. Based on these findings, we conclude that the addition of HOCO to diets aids in the reduction of food intake, which may contribute to the maintenance of healthy body weight.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29877687>Ligand-Asymmetric Janus Quantum Dots for Efficient Blue-Quantum Dot Light-Emitting Diodes.</a></h2><p>We present ligand-asymmetric Janus quantum dots (QDs) to improve the device performance of quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). Specifically, we devise blue QLEDs incorporating blue QDs with asymmetrically modified ligands, in which the bottom ligand of QDs in contact with ZnO electron-transport layer serves as a robust adhesive layer and an effective electron-blocking layer and the top ligand ensures uniform deposition of organic hole transport layers with enhanced hole injection properties. Suppressed electron overflow by the bottom ligand and stimulated hole injection enabled by the top ligand contribute synergistically to boost the balance of charge injection in blue QDs and therefore the device performance of blue QLEDs. As an ultimate achievement, the blue QLED adopting ligand-asymmetric QDs displays 2-fold enhancement in peak external quantum efficiency (EQE = 3.23%) compared to the case of QDs with native ligands () (peak EQE = 1.49%). The present study demonstrates an integrated strategy to control over the charge injection properties into QDs via ligand engineering that enables enhancement of the device performance of blue QLEDs and thus promises successful realization of white light-emitting devices using QDs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28710138>Disruption of Lipid Uptake in Astroglia Exacerbates Diet-Induced Obesity.</a></h2><p>Neuronal circuits in the brain help to control feeding behavior and systemic metabolism in response to afferent nutrient and hormonal signals. Although astrocytes have historically been assumed to have little relevance for such neuroendocrine control, we investigated whether lipid uptake via lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in astrocytes is required to centrally regulate  homeostasis. Ex vivo studies with hypothalamus-derived astrocytes showed that LPL expression is upregulated by , whereas it is decreased in response to palmitic  or triglycerides. Likewise, astrocytic LPL deletion reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets in those glial cells. Consecutive in vivo studies showed that postnatal ablation of LPL in glial fibrillary acidic protein-expressing astrocytes induced exaggerated body weight gain and glucose intolerance in mice exposed to a high-fat diet. Intriguingly, astrocytic LPL deficiency also triggered increased ceramide content in the hypothalamus, which may contribute to hypothalamic insulin resistance. We conclude that hypothalamic LPL functions in astrocytes to ensure appropriately balanced nutrient sensing, ceramide distribution, body weight regulation, and glucose metabolism.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30114400>Conserved transcriptional activity and ligand responsiveness of avian PPARs: Potential role in regulating lipid metabolism in mirgratory birds.</a></h2><p>Migratory birds undergo metabolic remodeling in tissues, including increased lipid storage in white adipose and fatty  uptake and oxidation in skeletal muscle, to optimize  substrate availability and utilization in preparation for long-distance flight. Different tissues undergo gene expression changes in keeping with their specialized functions and driven by tissue specific transcriptional pathways. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are lipid-activated nuclear receptors that regulate metabolic pathways involved in lipid and glucose utilization or storage in mammals. To examine whether PPARs might mediate fatty  activation of metabolic gene programs that would be relevant during pre-migratory fattening, we used gray catbird as the focal species. PPAR isoforms cloned from catbird share high amino  identity with mammalian homologs (% vs human): gcPPARα (88.1%), gcPPARδ (87.3%), gcPPARγ (91.2%). We tested whether gcPPARs activated fatty  (FA) utilization genes using Lpl and Cpt1b gene promoter-luciferase reporters in mammalian cell lines. In C2C12 mouse myocytes gcPPARα was broadly activated by the saturated and unsaturated FAs tested; while gcPPARδ showed highest activation by the mono-unsaturated FA, 18:1  (+80%). In CV-1 monkey kidney cells gcPPARγ responded to the poly-unsaturated fatty , 20:5 eicosapentaenoic  (+60%). Moreover, in agreement with their structural conservation, gcPPARs were activated by isoform selective synthetic agonists similar to the respective mammalian isoform. Adenoviral mediated over-expression of PPARα in C2C12 myocytes induced expression of genes involved in fatty  transport, including Cd36/Fat, as well as Cpt1b, which mediates a key rate limiting step of mitochondrial β-oxidation. These gene expression changes correlated with increased lipid droplet accumulation in C2C12 myoblasts and differentiated myotubes and enhanced β-oxidation in myotubes. Collectively, the data predict that the PPARs play a conserved role in gray catbirds to regulate lipid metabolism in target tissues that undergo metabolic remodeling throughout the annual migratory cycle.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Plin2 is an abundant LD coating protein in skeletal muscle, but its importance for muscle function is unclear. We show that myotubes established from  mice contain reduced content of LDs and accumulate less  (OA) in triacylglycerol (TAG) due to elevated LD hydrolysis in comparison with  myotubes. The reduced ability to store TAG in LDs in  myotubes is accompanied by a shift in  metabolism.  myotubes are characterized by increased oxidation of OA, lower glycogen synthesis, and reduced glucose oxidation in comparison with  myotubes, perhaps reflecting competition between FAs and glucose as part of the Randle cycle. In accord with these metabolic changes,  myotubes have elevated expression of  and , transcription factors that stimulate expression of genes important for FA oxidation, whereas genes involved in glucose uptake and oxidation are suppressed. Loss of  had no impact on insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. Our results suggest that Plin2 is essential for protecting the pool of skeletal muscle LDs to avoid an uncontrolled hydrolysis of stored TAG and to balance skeletal muscle  metabolism.Copyright © 2017 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29124885>Oleoylethanolamide: The role of a bioactive lipid amide in modulating eating behaviour.</a></h2><p>Fatty  ethanolamides are lipid mediators that regulate a plethora of physiological functions. One such bioactive lipid mediator, oleoylethanolamide (OEA), is a potent agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α), which modulates increased expression of the fatty  translocase CD36 that enables the regulation of feeding behaviour. Consumption of dietary fat rich in  activates taste receptors in the gut activating specific enzymes that lead to the formation of OEA. OEA further combines with PPAR-α to enable fat oxidation in the liver, resulting in enhanced  production. Evidence suggests that sustained ingestion of a high-fat diet abolishes the anorexic signal of OEA. Additionally, malfunction of the enterocyte that transforms  produced during fat digestion into OEA might be responsible for reduced satiety and hyperphagia, resulting in overweight and obesity. Thus, OEA anorectic signalling may be an essential element of the physiology and metabolic system regulating dietary fat intake and obesity. The evidence reviewed in this article indicates that intake of , and thereby the resulting OEA imparting anorexic properties, is dependent on CD36, PPAR-α, enterocyte fat sensory receptors, histamine, oxytocin and dopamine; leading to increased fat oxidation and enhanced  expenditure to induce satiety and increase feeding latency; and that a disruption in any of these systems will cease/curb fat-induced satiety.© 2017 World Obesity Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692006>Short communication: Changes under low ambient temperatures in the milk lipodome and metabolome of mid-lactation cows after dehorning as a calf.</a></h2><p>Horns are living tissue and cows can use their horns for thermoregulatory purposes. We investigated the effect of the presence of horns on the metabolome of milk serum and lipidome of milk fat, to assess the physiological effect of dehorning. Milk sampling took place at low ambient temperatures of -6 to 2°C. Horned and dehorned cows were kept in a mixed herd of Holstein Friesian and Brown Swiss cows. The hypothesis was that horned cows needed to increase their metabolism to compensate for additional heat loss through the presence of their horns. No differences were observed in milk yield, milk solids, and somatic cell counts between horned and dehorned cows. For the milk metabolome, horned cows showed an upregulation of several glucogenic AA that could be transformed into glucose for  supply and a downregulation of sugar intermediates and γ-glutamylcysteine compared with dehorned cows. The fatty  (FA) composition in horned cows showed a shift toward decreased odd medium-chain FA (C7:0, C9:0, and C11:0) and increased cis-vaccenic  (C18:1n-7 cis-11) and stearidonic  (C18:4n-3). The changes in milk composition related to additional heat loss in horned cows indicate a competition in C3 metabolism for glucose synthesis and de novo FA synthesis under cold stress.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Here, we investigated effects of physiological concentrations of palmitic  (PA), stearic  (SA) and  (OA) on the viability, steroid production and gene expression in a bovine granulosa cell (GC) culture model. Treatment with individual and combined fatty acids increased the CD36 gene expression, while no significant apoptotic effects were observed. Both PA and SA significantly upregulated the expression of FSHR, LHCGR, CYP19A1, HSD3B1, CCND2 and increased 17β-estradiol (E2) production, while OA downregulated the expression of these genes and reduced E2. Interestingly, STAR was equally downregulated by all fatty acids and combination treatment. E2 was significantly reduced after combination treatment. To validate the effects of OA, in vivo growing dominant follicles (10-19 mm) were injected with bovine serum albumin (BSA) with/without conjugated OA. The follicular fluid was recovered 48 h post injection. As in our in vitro model, OA significantly reduced intrafollicular E2 concentrations. In addition, expression of CD36 was significantly up- and that of CYP19A1 and STAR significantly downregulated in antral GC recovered from aspirated follicles. The ovulation rates of OA-injected follicles tended to be reduced. Our results indicate that elevated free fatty  concentrations specifically target functional key genes in GC both in vitro and in vivo.

We describe here a strategy for a new family of photoelectrodes with upconverting nanocrystal assemblies as the photosensitizer. The assemblies consist of -capped cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanocrystals that coordinate directly onto a layer of surface-bound, carboxylic -derivatized anthracenes through displacement of the  capping ligands. Steady-state emission and transient absorption measurements show that the upconverting nanocrystal assemblies, selectively excited by green light, generate singlet excitons that enable efficient charge injection into both the conduction band of TiO at the photoanode and the valence band of NiO at the photocathode. The singlet excitons form by sensitized triplet-triplet annihilation within the compact layer of anthracenes on the electrode surfaces. Density of state analysis reveals that the electronic coupling between the anthracene singlet excited states and the oxides provides a thermodynamic basis for light-induced charge transfer.

However, these reduction-responsive nanocarriers are generally trapped within endolysosomes after internalization and are subjected to unwanted disintegration, remarkably compromising the therapeutic performance. Herein, amphiphilic polyprodrugs of poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide-co-EoS)-b-PCPTM were synthesized via sequential reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, where EoS and CPTM are Eosin Y- and camptothecin (CPT)-based monomers, respectively. An oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion method was applied to self-assemble the amphiphilic polyprodrugs into hybrid vesicles in the presence of hydrophobic  (OA)-stabilized upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs, NaYF:Yb/Er), rendering it possible to activate the EoS photosensitizer under a near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation with the generation of singlet oxygen (O) through the  transfer between UCNPs and EoS moieties. Notably, the in situ generated singlet oxygen (O) can not only exert its photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect but also disrupt the membranes of endolysosomes and thus facilitate the endosomal escape of internalized nanocarriers (i.e., photochemical internalization (PCI)). Cell experiments revealed that the hybrid vesicles could be facilely taken up by endocytosis. Although the internalized hybrid vesicles were initially trapped within endolysosomes, a remarkable endosomal escape into the cytoplasm was observed under 980 nm laser irradiation as a result of the PCI effect of O. The escaped hybrid vesicles subsequently underwent GSH-triggered CPT release in the cytosol, thereby activating the chemotherapy process. The integration of PDT module into the design of reduction-responsive nanocarriers provides a feasible approach to enhance the therapeutic performance.</p></html>
