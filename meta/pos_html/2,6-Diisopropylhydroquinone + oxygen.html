The inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) is important for the maintenance of ATP production and other functions of mitochondria. The electron transport chain (ETC) generates an electrochemical gradient of protons known as the proton-motive force across the IMM and thus produces the mitochondrial membrane potential that is critical to ATP synthesis. One of the main factors regulating the structural and functional integrity of the IMM is the changes in the matrix volume. Mild (reversible) swelling regulates mitochondrial metabolism and function; however, excessive (irreversible) swelling causes mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. The central mechanism of mitochondrial swelling includes the opening of non-selective channels known as permeability transition pores (PTPs) in the IMM by high mitochondrial Ca and reactive  species (ROS). The mechanisms of reversible and irreversible mitochondrial swelling and transition between these two states are still unknown. The present study elucidates an upgraded biophysical model of reversible and irreversible mitochondrial swelling dynamics. The model provides a description of the PTP regulation dynamics using an additional differential equation. The rigidity tensor was used in numerical simulations of the mitochondrial parameter dynamics with different initial conditions defined by Ca concentration in the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum. We were able to estimate the values of the IMM rigidity tensor components by fitting the model to the previously reported experimental data. Overall, the model provides a better description of the reversible and irreversible mitochondrial swelling dynamics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society.

Synthetic wastewater having chemical  demand (COD) and biochemical  demand (BOD) of 400 ± 10% and 210 ± 10% mg/L respectively was fed and the reactor was subjected to OLRs ranging from 0.37 to 1.26 kg COD/m.d. It was observed that steady sloughing of biofilm occurs within the SAFF reactor all the times and average concentration of sloughed biomass in the effluent was 26 mg/L. The COD and BOD removal efficiencies varied between 85 and 89% and 86 to 94%, respectively. The kinetic studies demonstrated that SAFF reactor followed Stover-Kincannon and Grau models, with high correlation coefficients (R) of 0.9977 and 0.9916, respectively. Thus, the values of kinetic coefficients such as maximum substrate utilization rate, U = 64.1 g/(Ld); saturation value constant, K = 72.31 g/(L.d) and Grau second-order substrate removal rate constant, Ks = .44 day can be useful to develop and design large scale SAFF reactors. Finally, the study reveals that the optimum range for OLR can vary within 0.68-0.94 kg COD/m.d.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657888>Pharmacologic and Nonpharmacologic Therapies in Adult Patients With Exacerbation of COPD: A Systematic Review [Internet].</a></h2><p>To synthesize existing knowledge about the effectiveness and harms of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ECOPD).Embase, Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Registrar of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from database inception to January , 2019.We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated pharmacologic intervention or nonpharmacologic interventions for ECOPD. The strength of evidence (SOE) was graded for critical final health outcomes.We included 98 RCTs (13,401 patients, mean treatment duration 9.9 days, mean followup 3.7 months). Final health outcomes, including mortality, resolution of exacerbation, hospital readmissions, repeat exacerbations, and need for intubation, were infrequently evaluated and often showed no statistically significant differences between groups. Antibiotic therapy increases the clinical cure rate and reduces the clinical failure rate regardless of the severity of ECOPD (moderate SOE). There is insufficient evidence to support a particular antibiotic regimen. Oral and intravenous corticosteroids improve dyspnea and reduce the clinical failure rate (low SOE). Despite the ubiquitous use of inhaled bronchodilators in ECOPD, we found only a small number of trials that assessed lung function tests, and not final health outcomes. The evidence is insufficient to support the effect of aminophyllines, magnesium sulfate, mucolytics, inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled antibiotics, 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, and statins on final health outcomes. Titrated  reduces mortality compared with high flow  (low SOE). Low SOE suggested benefit from some nonpharmacologic interventions such as chest physiotherapy using vibration/percussion/massage or breathing technique (on dyspnea), resistance training (on dyspnea and quality of life), early pulmonary rehabilitation commenced before hospital discharge during the initial most acute phase of exacerbation rather than the convalescence period (on dyspnea) and whole body vibration training (on quality of life). Vitamin D supplementation may improve quality of life (low SOE).Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a common condition, the evidence base for most interventions in ECOPD remains limited. Systemic antibiotics and corticosteroids are associated with improved outcomes in mild and moderate to severe ECOPD. Titrated  reduces mortality. Future research is required to assess the effectiveness of several emerging nonpharmacologic and dietary treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669219>Benzimidazole-based dual dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and xanthine oxidase inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Multiple-targeting compounds might reduce complex polypharmacy of multifactorial diseases, such as diabetes, and contribute to the greater therapeutic success. Targeting reactive  species-producing enzymes, as xanthine oxidase (XO), might suppress progression of diabetes-associated vascular complications. In this study a small series of benzimidazole derivatives (1-9) was evaluated for inhibitory activity against dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) and XO. One 1,3-disubstituted-benzimidazole--imine (5) and 1,3-thiazolo[3,-a]benzimidazolone derivative (8) were shown as effective dual DPP-4 and XO inhibitors, with IC values lower than 200 μM, and predicted binding modes with both target enzymes. Both selected dual inhibitors (compounds 5 and 8) did not show cytotoxicity to a greater extent on Caco- cells even at concentration of 250 μM. These structures represent new non-purine scaffolds bearing two therapeutic functionalities, being DPP-4 and XO inhibitors, more favorable in comparison to DPP-4 inhibitors with DPP-4 as a single target due to pleiotropic effects of XO inhibition.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Wastewater with TC may have an adverse effect on ecosystems. Riboflavin-5'-phosphate (FMN or flavin mononucleotide) is a non-toxic product of the phosphorylation of vitamin B and is required for the proper functioning of the humans. FMN is sensitized to ultraviolet (UV) and blue light radiation, as evidenced by the generation of reactive  species (ROS). This study inspects feasible applications of blue light on FMN so as to develop a valid way of degrading TC by FMN photolysis. We used the increased rate of bacterial survival as a practical indicator of antibiotic degradation. TC in the presence of FMN solution decomposed completely after 20 W/m of blue light irradiation (TCF treatment), and the degradation of TC (D-TCF) occurred after the photolytic process. After TCF treatment, colony-forming units (CFUs) of  ( were determined for the D-TCF solution. The CFU of  preservation was 93.% of the D-TCF solution (50 μg/mL of TC in the presence of 114 μg/mL of FMN solution treated with 20 W/m of blue light irradiation at 25 °C for 1 h) cultivation. The mass spectrum of D-TCF showed diagnostic ion signals at m/z 431.0 and 414.0 Da. The molecular formula of D-TCF was CHNO, and the exact mass was 430.44 g/mol. TC degradation by FMN photolysis can significantly decrease the antimicrobial ability of TC. The results expressed here regarding the influence of FMN photolysis on TC degradation offer an environmentally sound wastewater treatment method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669797>Exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in type  diabetes: Potential role of oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) leads to exaggerated cardiovascular responses to exercise, in part due to an exaggerated exercise pressor reflex. Accumulating data suggest excessive oxidative stress contributes to an exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in cardiovascular-related diseases. Excessive oxidative stress is also a primary underlying mechanism for the development and progression of T2DM. However, whether oxidative stress plays a role in mediating the exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in T2DM is not known. Therefore, this review explores the potential role of oxidative stress leading to increased activation of the afferent arm of the exercise pressor reflex. Several lines of evidence support direct and indirect effects of oxidative stress on the exercise pressor reflex. For example, intramuscular ROS may directly and indirectly (by attenuating contracting muscle blood flow) increase group III and IV afferent activity. Oxidative stress is a primary underlying mechanism for the development of neuropathic pain, which in turn is associated with increased group III and IV afferent activity. These are the same type of afferents that evoke muscle pain and the exercise pressor reflex. Furthermore, oxidative stress-induced release of inflammatory mediators may modulate afferent activity. Collectively, these alterations may result in a positive feedback loop that further amplifies the exercise pressor reflex. An exaggerated reflex increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Thus, identifying the contribution of oxidative stress could provide a potential therapeutic target to reduce this risk in T2DM.Copyright © 2019.

Cerebral I/R results in excessive autophagy and neuronal demise. The present study was designed to explore the role of autophagy during ICS II-mediated neuroprotection on cerebral I/R in vivo and in vitro.The rat focal cerebral ischemia was induced  h of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion with ICS II, 3-MA or Rapamycin. The effect of ICS II was detemined using neurological behaviour and cerebral infarction. The expressions of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE 5), autophagy-related proteins and phosphorylation levels of GSK-3β were determined. Primary rat cortical neurons were subjected to  and glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) were applied to further elucidate the mechanism of ICS II on cerebral (I/R). A surface plasmon resonance assay and molecular docking were used to explore the interactions of ICS II with PDE 5 or GSK-3β.ICS II not only protected against MCAO-induced injury in rats, but also attenuated primary cortical neurons injury upon OGD/R. The neuroprotective effects of ICS II on cerebral I/R were attributed to mediating PKG/GSK-3β/autophagy axis. ICS II directly bound to PDE 5 and GSK-3β, and there also existed the interaction between PKG and GSK-3β.These findings indicate that ICS II attenuates cerebral I/R-induced injury via mediating PKG/GSK-3β/autophagy axis. This study will raise the possibility that ICS II may be exploited into a potent PDE 5 inhibitor against ischemia stroke.This article is protected by copyright.

The ponds were filled with water and  PL were released in the ponds with stocking density @ 4 m. Ponds 1 and  were fed with Conventional Feed (fish meal) and ponds 3 and 4 were fed with Formulated Feed (Soybean +  + ). Water quality parameters like surface water temperature, pH, dissolved , transparency, nitrate, phosphate and silicate, chlorophyll  and organic carbon were monitored for 195 days. Significant variation (p < 0.05) in the water quality parameters were observed during the culture period between ponds respectively. Growth parameters like daily growth rate (DGR), specific growth rate (SGR) and condition index (CI) were monitored simultaneously which showed a discrete growth during the first 90 days and then a stable growth form. Length and weight relationship of prawns were calculated for all the culture ponds which showed highly positive relationship (p < 0.01) proving unique contribution of feed towards the growth of prawns. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) values (Ranging from .74 ± .05 to .95 ± 0.04) also proved the greater acceptance of feed towards the growth of prawns. Biochemical analysis of the feed and prawn (protein, carbohydrate, lipid and astaxanthin) also proved the feed efficiency towards growth and coloration of prawn. Benefit cost analysis (BCA) computed for conventional feed (1.23) and formulated feed (1.62) yielded 637 kg ha and 865 kg ha respectively.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670173>The effectiveness of a nurse-led exercise and health education informatics program on exercise capacity and quality of life among cancer survivors after esophagectomy: A randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Esophagectomy is the primary surgical treatment for esophageal cancer. However, patients often experience a decrease in physical activity, poor nutrition, and a reduction in quality of life following surgery.The aim of this study was to examine the effects of an exercise and nursing education health informatics program on quality of life, exercise capacity, and nutrition among patients following esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.A randomized controlled trial.Patients who had undergone an esophagectomy for cancer were recruited by purposive sampling from a medical center in Taiwan. Patients who met inclusion criteria and agreed to participate (N = 88) were randomly assigned to an exercise informatics program (intervention group, n = 44) or usual post-surgery care (control group, n = 44). Quality of life was assessed at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge. Secondary outcomes of nutrition (albumin, body mass index), and exercise capacity (maximal  uptake, the six-minute walking test) were conducted at baseline and 3 months following discharge. Differences in quality of life, nutrition and exercise capacity between the two groups were analyzed using generalized estimating equations.Analysis demonstrated significant improvements in outcome measures following hospital discharge for the intervention group compared to controls. Measures of quality of life were significantly better for the intervention group and varied with time following discharge. Functional scores for physical (1 and 3 months), role (1, 3, and 6 months), emotional (1 month), social (3 months) and global health (3 months) were significantly higher than controls. Cancer-related subscales improved for insomnia (1 and 3 months) and nausea/vomiting (3 and 6 months). Esophageal cancer-specific symptoms improved for dry mouth (1 month), dysphagia (3 months), and loss of taste (1 and 6 months). Three months following discharge, levels of albumin were significantly higher for the intervention group compared to controls (β=0.32, 95% CI 0.09, 0.54, p < .01); body mass index did not differ between groups. Exercise capacity was also significantly better; the intervention group had higher maximal  consumption (β=.61, 95% CI 1.54, 3.69, p < .001) and greater distance on the six-minute walking test (β=83.30, 95% CI 52.60, 113.99, p < .001).The intervention group experienced significant improvements in nutrition, exercise capacity, and variables related to quality of life. These findings suggest a nurse-led exercise and health education informatics program should be implemented for survivors of esophagectomy prior to hospital discharge.Copyright © 2019.

We investigated the safety of naringenin, its effects on metabolic rate, and blood glucose and insulin responses in a single female subject with diabetes. The subject ingested 150 mg naringenin from an extract of whole oranges standardized to 28% naringenin three times/day for 8 weeks, and maintained her usual food intake. Body weight, resting metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, and blood chemistry panel including glucose, insulin, and safety markers were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Adverse events were evaluated every  weeks. We also examined the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase G (PKG) in the response of human adipocytes to naringenin treatment. Compared to baseline, the body weight decreased by .3 kg. The metabolic rate peaked at 3.5% above baseline at 1 h, but there was no change in the respiratory quotient. Compared to baseline, insulin decreased by 18%, but the change in glucose was not clinically significant. Other blood safety markers were within their reference ranges, and there were no adverse events.  and  mRNA expression was reduced by inhibitors of PPAR and PPAR, but there was no effect of PKA or PKG inhibition. We conclude that naringenin supplementation is safe in humans, reduces body weight and insulin resistance, and increases metabolic rate by PPAR and PPAR activation. The effects of naringenin on energy expenditure and insulin sensitivity warrant investigation in a randomized controlled clinical trial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669839>BaMnO nanostructures: Simple ultrasonic fabrication and novel catalytic agent toward  evolution of water splitting reaction.</a></h2><p>In the current paper, the main aim is to fabricate the BaMnO nanostructures via the sonochemical route. The various factor, including precursors, reaction time and power of sonication can affect the shape, size, and purity of the samples. We utilized X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to characterize the BaMnO nanostructures. The optical property of BaMnO nanostructures was explored by Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) and the energy gap was suitable for catalytic activity (about .75 eV). Changing the precursor can affect the size, nanoparticle shape, architectures, and uniformity of the samples. We employed the BaMnO nanostructures for O evolution reaction as catalysts. It can observe that increasing the homogeneity of the catalysts can increase the efficiency of the  evolution reaction. The maximum amount of the O evolution and the highest TOF and TON are related to nanoplate disc using barium salicylate as a precursor of barium. As a result, we can nominate the BaMnO nanostructures as an effective and novel catalyst for water-splitting reaction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

BTH at 100 mg·L regulated changes in ROS generation and scavenging in healing tissues of potato tubers. A higher HO content was presented in healing tissues of potato tubers, while cell membrane permeability and malondialdehyde content declined due to BTH treatment. Additionally, the activities and transcript level of enzymes related with ROS generation, including NADPH oxidase, peroxidase and polyamine oxidase, as well as enzymes involved in ROS scavenging, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase, were significantly enhanced by BTH treatment. It is suggested that ROS metabolism might play a crucial role in wound healing of potato tubers mediated by BTH during postharvest.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Efficacy of a Goal Setting and Implementation Planning Intervention on Firefighters' Cardiorespiratory Fitness. J Strength Cond Res 33(11): 3151-3161, 2019-The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a goal setting and implementation planning (GSIP) intervention on cardiorespiratory fitness among firefighters. Male career firefighters (N = 20) from a large municipal fire department were assigned to an intervention arm (n = 12) or passive control arm (n = 8) of a 14-week study involving cardiorespiratory exercise. The intervention consisted of GSIP coaching at baseline and support throughout the study. Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed through a standardized physical protocol for firefighters (Candidate Physical Ability Test) at baseline, at 6 weeks, and at 14 weeks time points, using the Cosmed K4b portable metabolic system to measure physiological variables. Using intention-to-treat principles, we employed a -level multilevel model to examine the effect of intervention group on intercept and change over time on primary outcomes of interest:  transport and utilization (VO2), heart rate (HR), and respiratory exchange ratio (R). Results demonstrated that the intervention and control groups both exhibited a significant increase in VO2 (B = 0.143, SE = 0.025, p < 0.001) and a decline in R (B = -0.003. SE = 0.001, p < 0.01) over the course of the study. Although both groups exhibited improvements on  of the 3 cardiorespiratory outcomes, subjects assigned to the intervention did not exhibit superior outcomes when compared to the control group. Given the improvements we observed in  out of 3 outcomes across both conditions, future research may consider testing effectiveness of interventions consisting of functional training exercises that closely translate to firefighting tasks over time periods sufficient to elicit aerobic metabolic adaptations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658548>[Clinical therapeutic observation on sequential treatment of chronic wounds with repeated recurrence of hidradenitis suppurativa in buttocks].</a></h2><p> To observe the clinical effects of sequential treatment with extensive lesion resection, vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid, and tissue transplantation on hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in buttocks which recurred after multiple surgeries.  From January 2012 to March 2017, 15 male patients (aged 26-53 years) hospitalized in our burn ward with Hurley's stage Ⅲ HS in the buttocks recurred after -5 operations who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the prospective self pre- and post-control study. After extensive resection of the lesion, continuous VSD combined with intermittent irrigation of -loaded fluid was given, with negative pressure of -16.7 kPa and flow rate of pure  of 1.0 L/min. After 7 days of treatment with VSD combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid, the negative pressure device was removed and autologous posterior thigh split-thickness skin grafts and/or local flaps were transplanted to repair the wounds. Six patients were performed with split-thickness skin grafting, 4 patients with local flap transplantation, and 5 patients with split-thickness skin grafting together with local flap transplantation. The donor sites of local flaps were sutured directly or transplanted with autologous posterior thigh split-thickness skin grafts, and the donor sites of split-thickness skin grafts with autologous thin split-thickness scalp. The wound tissue or wound granulation tissue was collected before lesion resection and 7 days after treatment with VSD combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid respectively for bacterial culture and detecting of the content of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Survival of skin grafts and flaps after operation was observed, hospitalization time was recorded, and recurrence and complications of HS were followed up. Data were processed with paired sample  test.  Bacterial culture result of wound tissue before lesion resection was positive in all patients, mainly  and anaerobic bacteria, etc., while that of wound granulation tissue after 7 days of treatment with VSD combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid was negative. The content of TNF-α in wound granulation tissue after 7 days of treatment with VSD combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid was (10.1±.9) pg/L, significantly lower than (73.6±5.6) pg/L before lesion resection (=33.47, <0.01). The skin grafts and/or flaps of 15 patients survived post operation, and the wounds were healed. The patients were hospitalized for 17-31 days. During follow-up of 1 to 5 years, no recurrence of HS occurred in operative site of buttocks of 15 patients, but 1 patient had ulceration of healed perianal incision caused by high anal fistula and was healed after treatment.  Sequential treatment with extensive resection, VSD combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid, and tissue transplantation can thoroughly remove HS lesions in the buttocks and improve the condition of wound bed for skin acceptance after debridement, which is conducive to the cure of HS in the buttocks which has undergone multiple operations but still recurs after operation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663723>Tetra-,3-pyrazinoporphyrazines with Peripherally Appended Pyridine Rings. 20. Mono- and Pentanuclear Al and Ga Complexes: Synthesis and Physicochemical and Photoactivity Studies.</a></h2><p>The autocyclotetramerization of the precursor ,3-dicyano-5,6-di('-pyridyl)pyrazine [(CN)PyPyz] in the presence of MCl compounds (M = Al, Ga) leads to the formation of the new mononuclear porphyrazine complexes [PyTPyzPzMCl]·HO (PyTPyzPz = tetrakis-,3-[5,6-di(-pyridyl)pyrazino]porphyrazinato anion). From these species, the hydroxide analogues [PyTPyzPzMOH]·HO were obtained by contact with hot water, and their corresponding pentanuclear species [(PdCl)PyTPyzPzMCl]·HO could be easily formed by the reaction with PdCl. Physicochemical characterization of the mono- and pentanuclear macrocycles was based on elemental analysis, and mass, powder X-ray, and IR spectra. UV-vis spectral studies of the mononuclear species in solutions of DMF, DMSO, or pyridine ( ≈ 10-10 M) indicate (mainly in DMF and DMSO) the initial presence of aggregation, in some cases accompanied by the concomitant occurrence for the complex of a one-electron reduction. While disaggregation into a single species evolves spontaneously over time, the -1 charged species, eventually also found present, can be brought back to its neutral form by addition of a slight amount of HCl, the final spectrum showing the presence of the starting neutral species in its pure monomeric form. Similar aspects were faced also for the parent pentanuclear complexes. Cyclic voltammetry experiments, conducted for the mono-/pentanuclear complexes in DMF and DMSO ( ≈ 10 M), exhibit progressive one-electron reductions (1 → 4) characterized by  values (V vs SCE) positioned to significantly less negative values than those known for the phthalocyanine (Pc) analogues, these data confirming the previously already proven higher electron-deficient character of the M derivatives of the PyTPyzPz macrocycle with respect to Pc. The role of the present new series of Al and Ga macrocyclic species to act as photosensitizers for the generation of singlet , O, the cytotoxic agent in the anticancer treatment known as photodynamic therapy (PDT), has been explored in DMF/HCl. Among the quantum yields Φ, the value found for the Ga complex [PyTPyzPzGaCl] (0.68), practically coincident with that observed for the TTDPz analogue (0.69), is well above those of most porphyrazines analogues (Φ = 0.4-0.6), a result encouraging further research work for potential applications in the biochemical field.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669540>15-Keto prostaglandin E induces heme oxygenase-1 expression through activation of Nrf2 in human colon epithelial CCD 841 CoN cells.</a></h2><p>Prostaglandin E (PGE) plays a key role in inflammation-associated carcinogenesis. NAD-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) catalyzes the oxidation of the 15(S)-hydroxyl group of PGE to generate 15-keto PGE. 15-PGDH has been known as a tumor suppressor in various malignancies including colon cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumor-suppressive function of 15-PGDH remain largely unresolved. In this study, we found that 15-keto PGE upregulated the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a representative antioxidative and anti-inflammatory enzyme, at both transcriptional and translational levels in human colon epithelial CCD 841 CoN cells. A redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) plays a critical role in the regulation of HO-1 and other cytoprotective proteins. 15-Keto PGE induced translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus and antioxidant response element-driven luciferase activity. Furthermore, the silencing of the Nrf2 gene abolished 15-keto PGE-induced HO-1 expression in CCD 841 CoN cells. 15-Keto PGE activated AKT signaling, and the pharmacological AKT inhibitor, LY294002 suppressed the 15-keto PGE-induced HO-1 expression. 15-Keto PGE generates the reactive  species which is suppressed by the general antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine. N-acetyl-l-cysteine treatment attenuated the 15-keto PGE-induced phosphorylation of GSK3β, transcriptional activity of Nrf2, and subsequently HO-1 expression. However, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE lacking the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety failed to induce reactive  species, HO-1 expression and nuclear translocation of Nrf2. In conclusion, 15-keto PGE induces HO-1 expression through Nrf2 activation in human colon epithelial cells.Copyright © 2019.

Meta-analysis showed that the oxygenation index in Helmet non-invasive ventilation group was significantly higher than that in  therapy group [mean difference (MD) = 73.47, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 52.01 to 94.92, P = 0.000 01], and PaCO (MD = -.46, 95%CI was -4.54 to -0.39, P = 0.02), endotracheal intubation rate [relative risk ratio (RR) = 0.38, 95%CI was 0.20 to 0.73, P = 0.004] and hospital mortality (RR = 0.35, 95%CI was 0.19 to 0.65, P = 0.000 8) in Helmet non-invasive ventilation group were significantly lower than those in  therapy group. There was no significant difference in patient's intolerance between the two groups (RR = .38, 95%CI was 0.74 to 7.67, P = 0.15).Compared with  therapy, the Helmet non-invasive ventilation used for treatment of patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure can effectively improve the oxygenation index, decrease the PaCO, reduce the endotracheal intubation rate and hospital mortality, and the patients are well tolerated to the Helmet method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661109>Spontaneous wrinkle emergence in nascent eumelanin thin films.</a></h2><p>Self-patterning processes originated by physical stimuli have been extensively documented in thin films, whereas spontaneous wrinkling phenomena due to chemical transformation processes are, to the best of our knowledge, unprecedented. Herein we report a case of spontaneous polymerization-driven surface nano-patterning (∼500 nm) that develops in smooth thin solid films of 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI), a major precursor of eumelanin polymers, over a time scale of 30 to 60 days in air at room temperature. The phenomenon can be observed only above a critical film thickness of ∼250 nm and it is affected by exposure to ammonia vapors causing acceleration of the oxidation process. The thickness-dependent onset of wrinkling can be attributed to non-homogeneous rates of oxidation through the film causing slow swelling/expansion of the inner layers followed by fast stiffening and cross-linking in the outer layer exposed to higher  levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672377>The study of the interaction mechanism between bovine serum albumin and single-walled carbon nanotubes depending on their diameter and concentration in solid nanocomposites by vibrational spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>The results of the study of composites based on bovine serum albumin (BSA) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) are presented. Nanocomposites were created by evaporation of the water-albumin dispersion with nanotubes using diode laser with temperature control. Two types of nanotubes were used. SWCNT I were synthesized using the electric arc method, SWCNT II were synthesized using the gas phase method. SWCNT I had a diameter and length less than SWCNT II. The mechanism of interaction between BSA and SWCNT in solid nanocomposites is considered. An experimental and theoretical studies of the interaction between aspartic (Asp) and glutamic (Glu) amino acids located on the outer surface of BSA and nanotubes using of vibrational spectroscopy (Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy) was carried out. The possibility of nanotubes functionalization by  atoms of negative amino acid residues Asp and Glu, which are on the outer surface of BSA, is shown by molecular modeling. The formation of covalent bonds between BSA and SWCNT in nanocomposites with different concentrations of nanotubes (0.01, 0.1 and 1 g/l) was confirmed by vibrational spectra. The covalent interaction between BSA with SWCNT under the laser irradiation leads to the conformational changes in the secondary and tertiary structures of albumin. This is confirmed by a significant decrease in the intensity of the absorption bands in the high-frequency region. The calculation of the vibrational spectra of the three Glycine:Glycine, Glutamic acid:Threonine and Aspartic acid:Lysine complexes, which take into account hydrogen, ion-dipole and ion-ion bonds, showed that a disturbance in the intermolecular interaction between amino acid residues led to significant decrease in the intensity of absorption bands in the region of stretching vibrations bonds OH and NH. From the Raman spectra, it was found that a significant number of defects in SWCNT is caused by the covalent attachment of  atoms to the graphene surface of nanotubes. An increase in the diameter of nanotubes (4 nm) has practically no effect on the absorption spectrum of nanocomposite, while measuring the concentration of SWCNT affects the FTIR spectra. This confirmed the hydrophobic interaction between BSA and SWCNT. Thus, it was shown that BSA solid nanocomposites with CNTs can interact either with the help of hydrophobic forces or with the formation of covalent bonds, which depends on the diameter of the used nanotubes. The viability of connective fibroblast tissue cells on nanocomposites with both types of SWCNT was demonstrated. It was found that nanocomposites based on SWCNT I provide slightly better compatibility of their structure with fibroblasts. It allows to achieve better cell adhesion to the nanocomposite surface. These criteria make extensive use of scaffold nanocomposites in biomedicine, depending on the requirements for their quality and application.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The agent, granulated coal ash (GCA), was developed using the granulation processes for coal fly ash. The GCA increased the permeability coefficient of the sediment by seven times, changing its the properties from a typical clayey silt to that of silt, according to the soil classification standards based on permeability coefficient. Increased permeability was attributed to Ca ions, and adsorbed Na was immediately discharged, leading to a decrease in the sodium adsorption ratio. The activated flow of pore water stimulated nutrient loadings; PO-P and NH-N loads decreased by 55% and 44%, respectively. The GCA increased the dissolved  by 1.8 mg/L and increased the redox potential in pore water from -370 to -306 mV vs. Ag/AgCl. According to the results presented in this study, active capping with GCA to increase soil permeability is a novel and promising technology for reducing the nutrient loads and increasing the oxidation of contaminated clayey sediment in intertidal zones.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In a retrospective study, red cell compartment volume (RCV) responses to 4-weeks at ,500m were assessed in athletes with low (n=9, ≤20 and ≤30 ng·ml for women and men, respectively) and normal (n=10) serum ferritin levels ([Ferritin]) without iron supplementation. In a subsequent prospective study, the same responses were assessed in athletes (n=26) with a protocol designed to provide sufficient iron before and during identical altitude exposure. The responses to a 4-week training camp at sea-level were assessed in another athletes (n=13) as controls. RCV and maximal  uptake (Vo) were determined at sea-level before and after intervention. In the retrospective study, athletes with low [Ferritin] did not increase RCV (27.0±.9 to 27.5±3.8 ml·kg, mean±SD, P=0.65) nor Vo (60.±7. to 62.±7.5 ml·kg·min, P=0.23) after 4-weeks at altitude, whereas athletes with normal [Ferritin] increased both (RCV: 27.3±3.1 to 29.8±.4 ml·kg, P=0.002; Vo: 62.0±3.1 to 66.±3.7 ml·kg·min, P=0.003). In the prospective study, iron supplementation normalized low [Ferritin] observed in athletes exposed to altitude (n=14) and sea-level (n=6) before the altitude/sea-level camp, and maintained [Ferritin] within normal range in all athletes while the camp. RCV and Vo increased in the altitude group, but remained unchanged in the sea-level group. Finally, the increase in RCV correlated with the increase in Vo (r=0.368, 95% CI: 0.059 to 0.612, P=0.022). Thus, iron deficiency in athletes restrains erythropoiesis to altitude exposure and may preclude improvement in sea-level athletic performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673323>Hierarchically porous carbons as supports for fuel cell electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed Fe-N  moieties.</a></h2><p>The development of high-performance non-platinum group metal (non-PGM) catalysts for the  reduction reaction (ORR) is still of significance in promoting the commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this work, a "hierarchically porous carbon (HPC)-supporting" approach was developed to synthesize highly ORR active Fe-phenanthroline (Fe-phen) derived Fe-N  -C catalysts. Compared to commercial carbon black supports, utilizing HPCs as carbon supports can not only prevent the formation of inactive iron nanoparticles during pyrolysis but also optimize the porous morphology of the catalysts, which eventually increases the amount of reactant-accessible and atomically dispersed Fe-N  active sites. The prepared catalyst therefore exhibits a remarkable ORR activity in both half-cells (half-wave potential of 0.80 V in 0.5 M HSO) and H-air PEMFCs (442 mA cm at a working voltage of 0.6 V), making it among the best non-PGM catalysts for PEMFCs.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669409>Using a multimodal near-infrared spectroscopy and MRI to quantify gray matter metabolic rate for : A hypothermia validation study.</a></h2><p>Non-invasive quantitative imaging of cerebral  metabolism (CMRO) in small animal models is crucial to understand the role of oxidative metabolism in healthy and diseased brains. In this study, we developed a multimodal method combining near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and MRI to non-invasively study  delivery and consumption in the cortex of mouse and rat models. The term CASNIRS is proposed to the technique that measures CMRO with ASL and NIRS. To determine the reliability of this method, CMRO values were compared with reported values measured with other techniques. Also, the sensitivity of the CASNIRS technique to detect changes in CMRO in the cortex of the animals was assessed by applying a reduction in core temperature, which is known to reduce CMRO. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and CMRO were measured in five mice and five rats at a core temperature of 37 °C followed by another measurement at 33 °C. CMRO was 7.8 ± 1.8 and 3.7 ± 0.9 (ml/100 g/min, mean ± SD) in mice and rats respectively. These values are in good agreement with reported values measured by O PET, O NMR, and BOLD fMRI. In hypothermia, we detected a significant decrease of 37% and 32% in CMRO in the cortex of mice and rats, respectively. Q10 was calculated to be 3. in mice and .7 in rats. In this study we showed that it is possible to assess absolute values of metabolic correlates such as CMRO, CBF and  extraction fraction (OEF) noninvasively in living brain of mice and rats by combining NIRS with MRI. This will open new possibilities for studying brain metabolism in patients as well as the many mouse/rat models of brain disorders.Copyright © 2019.

Mammals have only one member, TRPA1, which is widely expressed in sensory neurons and in non-neuronal cells (such as epithelial cells and hair cells). TRPA1 owes its name to the presence of 14 ankyrin repeats located in the N-terminus of the channel, an unusual structural feature that may be relevant to its interactions with intracellular components. TRPA1 is primarily involved in the detection of an extremely wide variety of exogenous stimuli that may produce cellular damage. This include a plethora of electrophilic compounds that interact with nucleophilic amino acid residues in the channel, and many other chemically-unrelated compounds whose only common feature seems to be their ability to partition in the plasma membrane. TRPA1 has been reported to be activated by cold, heat and mechanical stimuli, and its function is modulated by multiple factors, including Ca, trace metals, pH, and reactive , nitrogen and carbonyl species. TRPA1 is involved in acute and chronic pain, inflammation, plays a role in the pathophysiology of nearly all organ systems and is an attractive target for the treatment of related diseases. Here we review the current knowledge about the mammalian TRPA1 channel, linking its unique structure, widely tuned sensory properties and complex regulation to its roles in multiple pathophysiological conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679420></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667811>Glycogenolysis in Cerebral Cortex During Sensory Stimulation, Acute Hypoglycemia, and Exercise: Impact on Astrocytic Energetics, Aerobic Glycolysis, and Astrocyte-Neuron Interactions.</a></h2><p>Most glycogen in cerebral cortex is located in astrocytes, and the importance of glycogenolysis for critical functions, including neurotransmission and memory consolidation, is strongly supported by many studies. However, specific mechanisms through which glycogen sustains essential functions remain to be established by rigorous, quantitative studies. Cerebral cortical glycogen concentrations are in the range of 10-12 μmol/g in carefully-handled animals, and the calculated rate of glycogenolysis (CMR) during sensory stimulation is approximately 60% that of glucose utilization (CMR) by all cells, with lower rates during acute hypoglycemia and exercise to exhaustion. CMR is at least fourfold higher when the volume fraction of astrocytes is taken into account. Inclusion of glycogen consumed during sensory stimulation in calculation of the -glucose index (OGI = CMR/CMR, which has a theoretical maximum of 6 when no other substrates are metabolized) reduces OGI from 5.0 to .8. Thus, at least 53% of the carbohydrate is not oxidized, suggesting that glycogen mobilization supports astrocytic glycolysis, not neuronal oxidation of glycogen-derived lactate that would cause OGI to exceed 6. Failure of glycogenolysis to dilute the specific activity of lactate formed from blood-borne [6-C]glucose indicates compartmentation of glycolytic metabolism of glucose and glycogen and the rapid release from cerebral cortex of glycogen-derived lactate. Together, these findings invalidate the conclusion by others that glycogen-derived lactate is a major fuel for neurons during neurotransmission, memory consolidation, and exercise to exhaustion. Alternative mechanisms, including glucose sparing for neurons, are presented as testable explanations for data interpreted as lactate shuttling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662969>Intermittent Hypoxic Training at Lactate Threshold Intensity Improves Aiming Performance in Well-Trained Biathletes with Little Change of Cardiovascular Variables.</a></h2><p>The main objective of this research was to evaluate the efficacy of intermittent hypoxic training (IHT) on aiming performance and aerobic capacity in biathletes. Fourteen male biathletes were randomly divided into a hypoxia group (H) ( = 7), which trained three times per week in a normobaric hypoxic environment (FiO = 16.5%, 2000 m a.s.l.) with lactate threshold intensity (LT) determined in hypoxia, and a control group (C) ( = 7), which exercised under normoxic conditions with LT intensity determined in normoxia. The training program included three weekly microcycles, followed by three days of recovery. The main part of the interval workout consisted of four 7 min (1 week), 8 min ( week), or 9 min (3 week) running bouts at treadmill separated by  minutes of active recovery. After the warm-up and during the rest between the bouts, the athletes performed aiming to the target in the standing position with a sporting rifle (20 s). The results showed that the IHT caused a significant ( < 0.05) increase in retention time in the target at rest (RT9) by 14.4% in hypoxia, whereas RT postincremental test (RT9) increased by 27.4% in normoxia and 26.7% in hypoxia. No significant changes in this variable were found in group C. Additionally, the capillary  saturation at the end of the maximal effort (SO) in hypoxia increased significantly ( < 0.001) by ∼4% after IHT. The maximal workload during the incremental test (WR) in normoxia also increased significantly ( < 0.001) by 6.3% after IHT. Furthermore, in absolute and relative values of VO in normoxia, there was a propensity ( < 0.07) for increasing this value by 5% in group H. In conclusion, the main findings of this study showed a significant improvement in resting and postexercise aiming performance in normoxia and hypoxia. Furthermore, the results demonstrated beneficial effects of the IHT protocol on aerobic capacity of biathletes.Copyright © 2019 Miłosz Czuba et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660818>Curcumin prevents brain damage and cognitive dysfunction during ischemic-reperfusion through the regulation of miR-7-5p.</a></h2><p>This study was to investigate the potential protective effects of curcumin in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CIR) and its regulation of miR-7.Rats were occluded by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1.5 h and reperfused for  h to establish a local CIR model. After 24 hours of model establishment, MCAO rats were given curcumin for 3 days by intragastric administration. PC12 cells were cultured for 6 h in -glucose deprivation medium and then reoxygenated for 24 h to establish an -glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model. The OGD/R model cells were treated with curcumin for 48 h.Curcumin inhibited the decrease of miR-7-5p expression and increase of RelA p65 expression induced by CIR and ODG/R. RelA p65 was a target of miR-7-5p. MiR-7-5p antagonists were able to counteract the effect of curcumin on the expression of RelA p65 in ischemic brain tissue of MCAO rats and OGD/R model cells. Curcumin improved OGD/R-induced inhibition of cell activity, necrosis and apoptosis. Curcumin significantly reduced the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, reactive  species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the activity of superoxide dismutases (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in OGD/R-induced cells. Curcumin may inhibit OGD/R-induced cell damage by regulating miR-7-5p. Curcumin improved cerebral infarction, nerve damage and cognitive dysfunction in rats with CIR, which may be related to the regulation of miR-7-5p/RelA p65 axis.Curcumin exerts cerebral protection by attenuating cell necrosis and apoptosis, inflammatory response and oxidative stress following CIR, which may be related to its regulation of the miR-7/RELA p65 axis.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676129>Porous dendritic PtRuPd nanospheres with enhanced catalytic activity and durability for ethylene glycol oxidation and  reduction reactions.</a></h2><p>Developing highly active and durable catalyst is of pivotal importance in fuel cells, owing to excessive consumption of fossil fuels.

Here we demonstrate that DHA, but not arachidonic acid (ARA), suppressed oligomeric amyloid-β peptide (oAβ)-induced reactive  species (ROS) production in primary mouse microglia and immortalized mouse microglia (BV2). Similarly, DHA but not ARA suppressed oAβ-induced increases in phosphorylated cytosolic phospholipase A (p-cPLA), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in BV2 cells. LC-MS/MS assay indicated the ability for DHA to cause an increase in 4-hydroxyhexenal (4-HHE) and suppress oAβ-induced increase in 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Although oAβ did not alter the nuclear factor erythroid -related factor  (Nrf2) pathway, exogenous DHA, ARA as well as low concentrations of 4-HHE and 4-HNE upregulated this pathway and increased production of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in microglial cells. These results suggest that DHA modulates ARA metabolism in oAβ-stimulated microglia through suppressing oxidative and inflammatory pathways and upregulating the antioxidative stress pathway involving Nrf2/HO-1.

Dissipation accelerated as pH increased with half-lives ranging from 26.9 to . days with slight inhibition in rice field water. The addition of divalent metals was not observed to catalyze the hydrolysis of CAP at pH 6, indicating that the insecticide is likely to remain recalcitrant to hydrolysis in neutral or acidic surface waters. However, Mn and Ni were observed to inhibit hydrolysis at pH 8 and 9. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared analysis supports the conclusion that divalent metals may withdraw electron density from the amide nitrogen via interaction with the amide , though additional quantum chemical modeling is necessary to provide further mechanistic insights. Overall, the hydrolysis of CAP in California rice fields and their surrounding surface waters will be dominated by pH and inhibited by dissolved metal species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665431>PAMP-INDUCED SECRETED PEPTIDE 3 (PIP3) modulates immunity in Arabidopsis thaliana.</a></h2><p>Small post-translationally modified peptides are important signalling components of plant defence responses against phytopathogens, acting both as positive and negative modulators. PAMP-INDUCED SECRETED PEPTIDE (PIP) 1 and  has been shown to amplify plant immunity. Here we investigate the role of the related peptide PIP3 in the regulation of immune response in Arabidopsis. Treatment with synthetic PIP peptides led to similar transcriptome reprogramming, indicating an effect on innate immunity-related processes and phytohormones, including jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and signalling. PIP3 overexpressing (OX) plants showed enhanced growth inhibition in response to flg22 exposure. In addition, flg22-induced production of reactive  species and callose deposition were significantly reduced in PIP3-OX plants. Interestingly, PIP3-OX plants showed increased susceptibility both toward Botrytis cinerea and the biotrophic pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Expression of both JA and salicylic acid biosynthesis and signalling genes was more induced during B. cinerea infection in PIP3-OX plants compared with wild-type plants. Promoter and ChIP-seq analyses indicated that the transcription factors WRKY18, WRKY33 and WRKY40 cooperatively act as repressors for PIP3. The results point to a fine-tuning role for PIP3 in modulation of immunity through the regulation of SA and JA biosynthesis and signalling pathways in Arabidopsis.© The Author(s) 2019.

Four footwear conditions with identical outsoles, insoles, upper materials, but different mechanical properties regarding polyurethane midsole materials were investigated. Respective midsole material characteristics were selected to represent a wide range of running shoes. The test procedure for eighteen well-trained male runners was divided into three treadmill testing sessions: an incremental ramp protocol to estimate the individual ventilatory threshold (day 1), a test with 6-minute stages in each shoe at 70% (aerobic, day ) and 102% (anaerobic, day 3) of the participant's ventilatory threshold. For  uptake and the heart rate, no significant differences between footwear conditions were found for either running condition. Furthermore, no significant relationships between physiological variables and mechanical midsole characteristics were found. The wide range of significant stiffness differences in the rearfoot (52.7 N/mm) and forefoot areas (50.7 N/mm), as well as significant differences of the shoe midsole material energy loss in the rearfoot (18.8%) and forefoot areas (10.7%) were too low to influence physiological variables significantly when running below and slightly above the ventilatory threshold. It seems that shoe mass and shoe comfort can influence physiological variables more than the mechanical midsole characteristics of stiffness and energy loss. These results may have practical implications for shoe manufacturers, coaches, and athletes, alike.© 2019 Christian Mitschke, Katrin Karger, Thomas L.

Consequently, we aimed to investigate the effect of these nanoparticles on hepatic regeneration after liver injury by partial hepatectomy and acetaminophen overdose.All the in vitro experiments were performed in HepG2 cells. For the acetaminophen and partial hepatectomy experimental models, male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: (1) nanoparticles group, which received 0.1 mg/kg cerium nanoparticles i.v. twice a week for  weeks before 1 g/kg acetaminophen treatment, () N-acetyl-cysteine group, which received 300 mg/kg of N-acetyl-cysteine i.p. 1 h after APAP treatment and (3) partial hepatectomy group, which received the same nanoparticles treatment before partial hepatectomy.

Bioreductive agents represent a class of prodrugs that target hypoxic tumor cells. Their bioactivity depends on the reactivity of their functional chemical groups. Their efficacy requires metabolic reduction and subsequent generation of toxic prodrugs. Chemoresistance of tumor cells is a major problem for successful antitumor therapy for many types of tumors, especially for breast cancer. The present study was performed to assess the effect of the antiproliferation activity of the tested benzimidazoles by way of NF-κB expression inhibition. The activity of the tested compounds on T47D and MCF7 cells was examined by WST, western blot, NF-κB transactivation assay, and apoptotic cell population analysis. Compound 3 was highly cytotoxically active against T47D cells, especially in hypoxic conditions. Its IC of 0.31 ± 0.06 nM, although weaker than tirapazamine, was significantly higher than the other tested compounds (.4-3.0 fold). The increased bax protein expression upon exposure to the tested compounds indicated intercellular apoptotic pathway activity, with tumor cell death by way of apoptosis. Increased bax protein synthesis and apoptotic cell dominance upon treatment, especially with N-oxide derivatives (92% apoptotic cells among T47D cell populations during treatment with compound 3), were correlated with each other. Additionally, both increased bax protein and decreased NF-κB protein expression supported antiproliferative activity via NF-κB-DNA binding inhibition associated with the tested compounds. Compound 3 appeared to be the strongest inhibitor of NF-κB expression in hypoxic conditions (the potency against NF-κB expression was about 75% of that of tirapazamine).

Selenium is a nutritionally essential trace metalloid well documented to elicit compelling pharmacological activities in vitro and in vivo. Report on the influence of selenium on arsenic-mediated behavioral derangement is lacking in literature. Hence, to fill this knowledge gap, rats were either exposed to arsenic per se in drinking water at 60 µg AsONa/L or co-administered with inorganic selenium at 0.25 mg/kg or organic selenium diphenyl diselenide (DPDS) at .5 mg/kg body weight for 45 successive days. Neurobehavioural data from rats in a new environment using video-tracking software evinced that inorganic and organic forms of selenium significantly (p < 0.05) abrogated arsenic-induced motor and locomotor insufficiencies such as increased negative geotaxis and fecal pellets numbers as well as the diminution in grip strength, body rotation, maximum speed, absolute turn angle and total distance travelled. The augmentation in the behavioral activities in rats co-administered with arsenic and both forms of selenium was substantiated using track and occupancy plots analyses. Selenium mitigated arsenic-induced decreases in glutathione level and acetylcholinesterase activity as well as the increase in oxidative stress and reactive  and nitrogen species. Moreover, selenium diminished inflammatory parameters (myeloperoxidase activity, nitric oxide, tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1 beta levels), caspase-3 activity and ameliorated histological lesions in the cerebellum, cerebrum and liver of the rats. Collectively, selenium abated arsenic-induced behavioral derangements via anti-inflammation, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic mechanisms in rats.Copyright © 2019.

The aim of this study is to explore the potential neuroprotective mechanism of curcumin against -glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury in HT22 cells and investigate whether type- superoxide dismutase (SOD2) is involved in the curcumin-induced protection. In the present study, HT22 neuronal cells were treated with 3 h OGD plus 24 h reoxygenation to mimic ischemia/reperfusion injury. Compared with the normal cultured control group, OGD/R treatment reduced cell viability and SOD2 expression, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial complex I activity, damaged cell morphology, and increased lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) release, cell apoptosis, intracellular reactive  species (ROS), and mitochondrial superoxide ( < 0.05). Meanwhile, coadministration of 100 ng/ml curcumin reduced the cell injury and apoptosis, inhibited intracellular ROS and mitochondrial superoxide accumulation, and ameliorated intracellular SOD2, cell morphology, MMP, and mitochondrial complex I activity. Downregulating the SOD2 expression by using siRNA, however, significantly reversed the curcumin-induced cytoprotection ( < 0.05). These findings indicated that curcumin induces protection against OGD/R injury in HT22 cells, and SOD2 protein may mediate the protection.Copyright © 2019 Yuqing Wang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678073>"Effect of the addition of different catalase concentrations to a TRIS-egg yolk extender on quality and in vitro fertilization rate of frozen-thawed bull sperm''.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different concentrations of catalase in a TRIS-egg yolk extender on sperm quality and embryonic development after in vitro fertilization of frozen-thawed bull sperm. For this purpose, from each of 7 bulls  ejaculates were collected and diluted with a TRIS-egg yolk extender containing 0, 5, 10, 15 or 20 IU catalase/mL. Sperm quality was evaluated 0, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after thawing by using computer assisted analysis of motility and by flow cytometric assays. Embryonic development was determined after in vitro fertilization of bovine oocytes. Semen diluted with TRIS-egg yolk extender containing different concentrations of catalase showed more motile sperm, more sperm with intact plasma membranes, acrosomes and DNA, a high mitochondrial membrane potential, a high esterase activity, a low Calcium level, a lower amount of synthesis of reactive  species and lower degree of lipid peroxidation of sperm compared to semen frozen without catalase (P < 0.05), but not before 3 h after thawing. There was a dose-response relationship with the most prominent effect of 20 IU catalase/mL. However, the improvement of sperm quality had no effect (P ≥ 0.05) on embryonic development after in vitro fertilization with 20 IU catalase/mL. In conclusion, the addition of catalase to the sperm extender improved sperm quality with no obvious effect on in vitro fertility.Copyright © 2019.

The inhibition effect of antrodin C on A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells was evaluated by plate clone formation, wound healing, cell cycle, activated caspase-3, Bax, P53, Bcl-, and RAPR activities as well as reactive  species release. Plate clone formation assay revealed that antrodin C could significantly inhibit the viability of A549 cells in vitro. Wound healing assay revealed that cell migration was inhibited by exposure to antrodin C at concentrations of 50 and 80 μg/mL. Flow cytometry revealed that antrodin C increased the percentages of cells in the G0/G1 phase at concentrations of 50 and 80 μg/mL and the apoptosis was related to upregulation of caspase-3, Bax, P53 expression, downregulation of Bcl-, RAPR expression, and the release of reactive  species in the A549 cells. CQ or RAPA could significantly promote or inhibit the inhibition effect on A549 proliferation induced by antrodin C, which suggests that the autophagy played a cytoprotective role on inhibition proliferation of A549 induced by antrodin C.

Herein, Prussian blue analogues (PBA) anchored on CdS nanorods (CdS NRs) pre-coated with polydopamine (PDA) are utilized as precursors to prepare ultrafine CoS nanoparticles supported on N, S-codoped CNTs (CoS@N,S-CNT), where CdS NRs are served as sulfur sources and hard templates. After pyrolysis, the resulting CoS@N,S-CNT-800 shows a high specific surface area of 142.4 m g, together with merely 0.780 V difference between the OER potential at 10 mA cm and the ORR potential at 3 mA cm. The CoS@N,S-CNT-800 based air cathode displays a higher discharge capacity of 787 mAh g at 10 mA cm, a higher output power density of 154 mW cm, better working stability, as well as a lower charge-discharge voltage gap than the Pt/C + RuO based air electrode at various working current density. The remarkable  reversible catalytic activities are mainly attributed to the presence of a thin layer of mesoporous carbon on partial sections of the open-end N,S-CNTs, which not only shortens the mass diffusion length but also prevents N,S-CNTs from excessively bundling to maximize the exposure of CoS nanocrystallites and graphitized carbon skeletons with N or S heteroatoms.Copyright © 2019.

In order to evaluate its feasibility for wetland plants treatment, hydrochars from different wetland plants were produced at different temperatures (200 °C, 220 °C, 240 °C, and 260 °C) and characterized, and the transformation of P was investigated. In comparison with wetland plant derived biochars, the derived hydrochars had a moderate pH (5.0-7.7), more -containing groups, and higher energy density (18.0-27.1 MJ kg). These properties were affected by hydrothermal temperature and feedstock choice. In contrast to high water-soluble P in biomass (71.0-73.% of total P), more recalcitrant P species formed in hydrochars, implying that HTC treatment could achieve P immobilization and reduce P leaching loss. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) results indicated that monoester-P and soluble orthophosphate were transformed to insoluble orthophosphate during the HTC treatment. Therefore, HTC is a promising treatment technique for wetland plants to produce valuable char with P reclamation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Accordingly, this investigation explores the waste tissue paper derived three dimensional (3D) carbon aerogel (CA) integrated with cerium dioxide (CeO) nanotubes decorated nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (NRGO) as a competent anode to address these technical complements. The direct growth of NRGO and CeO over CA in the form of freestanding and binder-free NRGO/CeO(1:)/CA alleviates the significant constrains of conventional anode fabrication. The 3D hierarchical architectures of CA with open porous structure provide easy access of bacteria, thus increases the bacterial colonies per unit volume. Furthermore, the hydrogen bonding between the interfacial  atoms of CeO and lysine residues of the cytochrome c in bacteria yields excellent extracellular electron transfer efficiency. The electrostatic interaction between the NRGO and bacteria cells improves the bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, leading to the compact biofilm formation for the improved direct electron transference. With the profits of above, the MFC with NRGO/CeO(1:)/CA demonstrates a maximum power output and good lifespan performances.

Furthermore, recent studies suggest that cancer can increase the risk of diabetes. Consequently, diabetes and cancer share many risk factors, but the cellular and molecular pathways correlating diabetes and colon and rectal cancer (CRC) remain far from understood. In this study, we assess the effect of hyperglycemia on cancer cell aggressiveness in human colon epithelial adenocarcinoma cells  and in an experimental animal model of CRC. Our results show that Nox (NADPH oxidase enzyme) 4-induced reactive  species (ROS) production is deregulated in both diabetes and CRC. This is paralleled by inactivation of the AMPK and activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) C1 signaling pathways, resulting in 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) accumulation, induction of DNA damage, and exacerbation of cancer cell aggressiveness, thus contributing to the genomic instability and predisposition to increased tumorigenesis in the diabetic milieu. Pharmacologic activation of AMPK, inhibition of mTORC1, or blockade of Nox4 reduce ROS production, restore the homeostatic signaling of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase/8-oxodG, and lessen the progression of CRC malignancy in a diabetic milieu. Taken together, our results identify the AMPK/mTORC1/Nox4 signaling axis as a molecular switch correlating diabetes and CRC.

For example, recent studies conducted in both the laboratory and field (e.g. high-altitude) have demonstrated that endothelial function is reduced in hypoxia. Herein, we review the several proposed mechanism(s) pertaining to the observed reduction in endothelial function in hypoxia including: a) changes in blood flow patterns (i.e. shear stress), b) increased inflammation and production of reactive  species (i.e. oxidative stress), c) heightened sympathetic nervous activity, and d) increased red blood cell concentration and mass leading to elevated nitric-oxide scavenging. Although some of these mechanism(s) have been examined in lowlanders, less in known about endothelial function in indigenous populations who have chronically adapted to environmental hypoxia for millennia (e.g. the Peruvian, Tibetan, and Ethiopian highlanders). There is some evidence indicating that healthy Tibetan and Peruvian (i.e. Andean) highlanders have preserved endothelial function at high-altitude, but less is known about the Ethiopian highlanders. However, Andean highlanders suffering from chronic mountain sickness, which is characterized by an excessive production of red blood cells, have markedly reduced endothelial function. This review will provide a framework and mechanistic model for vascular endothelial adaptation to hypoxia in lowlanders and highlanders. Elucidating the pathways responsible for vascular adaption/maladaptation to hypoxia has potential clinical implications for disease featuring low  delivery (e.g. heart failure, pulmonary disease). In addition, a greater understanding of vascular function at high-altitude will clinically benefit the globally estimated 85 million high-altitude residents. Abstract Figure: Overview of the conventional mechanism(s) that govern endothelial function in normoxic and hypoxic humans. This figure depicts the primary mechanism(s) governing changes in endothelial-dependent vascular smooth muscle vasodilation. Chronic, hypoxia (normobaric and hypobaric) results in 1) an increase in pro-atherogenic shear stress, ) heightened sympathetic nervous activity, 3) elevations in oxidative-nitrosative-inflammatory (OXINOS) stress defined by a free radical/inflammation-mediated reduction in vascular nitric oxide bioavailability, and 4) during chronic hypoxia exposure leading to increased red blood cell concentration - increased red blood cell mediated nitric oxide scavenging. Arterial segments that are chronically exposed to low, and oscillatory shear stress preferentially develop atherosclerotic lesions (Caro et al., 1969; Ku et al., 1985). Increased pro-atherogenic shear stress during hypoxia may be related to increased sympathetic nervous system outflow, which results in increased norepinephrine (i.e. NE) release sympathetic ganglia (T1-T5, upper body vasculature; T6-L2, lower body vasculature) onto α and β adrenergic receptors, which signal for smooth muscle vasoconstriction and vasodilation, respectively. A stimulus (e.g. shear stress) results in a release of endothelial endogenous calcium, which binds to calmodulin, and activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). The production of eNOS converts L-arginine into L-citrulline, and while doing so, releases nitric oxide. The newly produced nitric oxide is able to diffuse across the endothelial cell membrane and into the nearby smooth muscle cells. Within the smooth muscle cells, nitric oxide activates guanylate cyclase, and guanylate cyclase converts guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) into cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP). The cGMP upregulates cGMP dependent protein kinase G (PKG), which acts to inhibit myosin light chain kinase resulting in smooth muscle cell relaxation (Adelstein et al., 1978; Kerrick & Hoar, 1981). Upregulated cGMP also phosphorylates voltage-gated potassium channels resulting in potassium cellular extrusion, contributing to smooth muscle relaxation (Irvine et al., 2003). In addition, there is some evidence that suggests that NO may independently activate voltage-gated potassium channels (Bolotina et al., 1994). This article is protected by copyright.

Suppression of MALAT1 attenuated OGD/R-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, as evidenced by the increase of cell viability and the decrease of apoptosis rate. Besides that, miR-122 was found to be positive regulated by MALAT1. The protective effects of MALAT1 knockdown were flattened by miR-122 overexpression.

The obtained palladium(II) complexes have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy, ESI-mass spectrometry as well as elemental analysis. The cytotoxicity analysis indicates that most of the obtained palladium(II) complexes show promising growth inhibition in three human cancer cell lines. Flow cytometry analysis shows complex 3e could promote intracellular reactive  species (ROS) accumulation and lead cancer cell death. And the suppression of ROS accumulation and the rescue of cell viability in HeLa cells by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) suggest the possible link between the increase in ROS generation and cytotoxicity of complex 3e. Flow cytometry analysis also reveal that complex 3e cause cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, promote the generation of ROS and lead to tumor cell apoptosis. The interactions of complex 3e with calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) have been evaluated by UV-Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence quenching experiments and viscosity measurements, which reveal that the complex interact with CT-DNA through minor groove binding and/or electrostatic interactions.

The accumulation of toxic metabolites results in mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive  species production and oxidative damage, which have been associated with the disease pathophysiology. Clinical symptoms are heterogeneous and include cardiac complications, mainly cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias, which are recognized as one of the major life-threatening manifestations in patients. We aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the cardiac phenotype using a hypomorphic mouse model (Pcca(A138T)) that recapitulates some biochemical and clinical characteristics of PA. We demonstrate that Pcca(A138T) mice present with depressed cardiac function along with impaired cell contractility when compared to the wild-type mice. Cardiac dysfunction in Pcca(A138T) mice was associated with lower systolic Ca release ([Ca] transients), impairment in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca load and decreased Ca re-uptake by SR-Ca ATPase (SERCA2a). These functional changes correlated well with the depressed activity of SERCA2a, the elevated ROS levels and SERCA2a oxidation rate in cardiomyocytes isolated from Pcca(A138T) mice. In addition, decreased SR-Ca load in Pcca(A138T) cardiomyocytes was associated with increased diastolic Ca release. The increase in Ca sparks, Ca waves and spontaneous [Ca] transients in Pcca(A138T) cardiomyocytes could be responsible for the induction of ventricular arrhythmias detected in these mice. Overall, our results uncover the role of impaired Ca handling in arrhythmias and cardiac dysfunction in PA, and identify new targets for the development of therapeutic approaches for this devastating metabolic disease.Copyright © 2019.

The  isotope ratio of cellulose is a useful geographic tracer, as it integrates climate and source water signals. A predictive spatial model ("isoscape") of the δ O values of coffee bean cellulose is generated to evaluate coffee region-of-origin claims.The  isotope ratio of α-cellulose extracted from roasted coffee beans was measured via TC/EA-IRMS and used to calculate the δ O value of coffee bean water. The  O isotopic enrichment of coffee bean water relative to the δ O value of local precipitation was modeled as a function of local temperature and humidity. This function was incorporated into a mechanistic model of cellulose δ O values to predict the δ O values of coffee bean cellulose across coffee-producing regions globally.The δ O values of analyzed coffee bean cellulose ranged from approximately +22‰ to +42‰ (VSMOW). As expected, coffees grown in the same region tended to have similar isotope ratios, and the δ O value of coffee bean cellulose was generally higher than the δ O value of modeled stem cellulose for the region. Modeled δ O values of coffee cellulose were within ±.3‰ of the measured δ O value of coffee cellulose.The  isotope ratio of coffee bean cellulose is a useful indicator of region-of-origin and varies predictably in response to climatic factors and precipitation isotope ratios. The isoscape of coffee bean cellulose δ O values from this study provides a quantitative tool that can be applied to region-of-origin verification of roasted coffee at the point-of-sale.This article is protected by copyright.

Of these, 12% concerned preterms, whereas they are 8% of Dutch birth cohorts. Median age at admission was 3 m for preterms and  m for terms (p < 0.001). Preterms more often had received pertussis vaccination (62% vs 44%; p = 0.01) and more often had coinfections (37% vs 21%; p = 0.01). Preterms tended more often to have complications, to require artificial respiration or to need admittance to the intensive care unit (ICU). Preterms had longer ICU stays (15d vs 9d; p = 0.004). Vaccinated preterms and terms had a lower median length of hospital stay and lower crude risks of apneas and the need for artificial respiration, additional , and ICU admittance than those not vaccinated. After adjustment for presence of coinfections and age at admittance, these differences were not significant, except the lower need of  treatment in vaccinated terms. Effectiveness of the first vaccination against pertussis hospitalizations was 95% (95% CI 93-96%) and 73% (95% CI 20-91%) in terms and preterms, respectively. Effectiveness of the second dose of the primary vaccination series was comparable in both groups (86 and 99%, respectively).Infants hospitalized for pertussis suffer from severe disease. Preterms were overrepresented, with higher need for intensive treatment and less VE of first vaccination. These findings stress the need for alternative prevention, in particular prenatal vaccination of mothers, to reduce pertussis in both groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671811>Antimalarial Drugs Enhance the Cytotoxicity of 5-Aminolevulinic Acid-Based Photodynamic Therapy against the Mammary Tumor Cells of Mice In Vitro.</a></h2><p>Artemisinin and its derivatives, including artesunate (ART) and artemether (ARM), exert anticancer effects in the micromolar range in drug and radiation-resistant cell lines. Artemisinin has been reported to sensitize cervical cancer cells to radiotherapy. In the present study, we determined whether ART and ARM could enhance the cytotoxicity of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-based photodynamic therapy (PDT) against the mammary tumor cells of mice. The corrected PpIX fluorescence intensities in the control, 5-ALA, 5-ALA + ART, and 5-ALA + ARM groups were 3.385 ± 3.730, 165.7 ± 33.45, 139.0 ± 52.77, and 165.4 ± 51.10 a.u., respectively. At light doses of 3 and 5 J/cm, the viability of 5-ALA-PDT-treated cells significantly decreased with ART ( < 0.01 and  < 0.01) and ARM treatment ( < 0.01 and  < 0.01). Besides, the number of annexin V-FITC and ethidium homodimer III-positive cells was greater in the 5-ALA-PDT with ARM group than that in the other groups. -acetylcysteine could not significantly inhibit the percentages of apoptotic cells or inviable cells induced by 5-ALA-PDT with ARM. These reactive  species-independent mechanisms might enhance cytotoxicity in 5-ALA-PDT with ARM-treated tumor cells, suggesting that the use of 5-ALA-PDT with ARM could be a new strategy to enhance PDT cytotoxicity against tumor cells. However, as these results are only based on in vitro studies, further in vivo investigations are required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672277>Lysosome-associated membrane protein- deficiency increases the risk of reactive  species-induced ferroptosis in retinal pigment epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Lysosome-associated membrane protein- (LAMP2), is a highly glycosylated lysosomal membrane protein involved in chaperone mediated autophagy. Mutations of LAMP2 cause the classic triad of myopathy, cardiomyopathy and encephalopathy of Danon disease (DD). Additionally, retinopathy has also been observed in young DD patients, leading to vision loss. Emerging evidence show LAMP2-deficiency to be involved in oxidative stress (ROS) but the mechanism remains obscure. In the present study, we found that tert-butyl hydroperoxide or antimycin A induced more cell death in LAMP2 knockdown (LAMP2-KD) than in control ARPE-19 cells. Mechanistically, LAMP2-KD reduced the concentration of cytosolic cysteine, resulting in low glutathione (GSH), inferior antioxidant capability and mitochondrial lipid peroxidation. ROS induced RPE cell death through ferroptosis. Inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) increased lethality in LAMP2-KD cells compared to controls. Cysteine and glutamine supplementation restored GSH and prevented ROS-induced cell death of LAMP2-KD RPE cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, wheat bran protein isolate was digested with alcalase to produce wheat bran protein hydrolysate (WPH) that was then separated into different peptide fractions (<1, 1-3, 3-5, and 5-10 kDa) by membrane ultrafiltration. WPH and the peptide fractions were evaluated for in vitro activities such as antioxidant, renin inhibition, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. In addition, the blood pressure-lowering effects of WPH and the <1 kDa peptides were determined by oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Results showed that the ACE and renin inhibitions were significantly (p < .05) higher for the <1 kDa fraction (84.25% ± .45%, 75.19% ± 1.75%, respectively) when compared to the WPH and >1 kDa fractions. The <1 kDa fraction also showed significantly (p < .05) higher  radical antioxidant activity with 2044.73 ± 37.45 (μM TE/g protein) when compared to lower values obtained for the >1 kDa membrane fractions and WPH. Oral administration (100 mg/kg body weight) of the <1 kDa membrane fraction to SHRs resulted in a better decrease (-35 mmHg) in the systolic blood pressure when compared to the WPH (-20 mmHg) after 6 hr. And seven peptides (NL, QL, FL, HAL, AAVL, AKTVF, and TPLTR) were identified and amino acid sequence was determined by tandem mass spectrometry. We conclude that the WPH could be considered as a suitable natural antihypertensive and antioxidant resource. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The results of the present study indicate that WPH and its ultrafiltration fractions possess potential as a source of antihypertensive and strong antioxidant peptides. It has been proved that wheat bran has a good blood pressure lowering and antioxidation and other biological activities, and the <1 kDa fraction showing high  radical absorbance capacity level also has better in vitro ACE inhibition and renin-inhibitory activity. The higher antihypertensive efficiency of the <1 kDa fraction may be because the peptides can be better absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract or an increased ability to interact with the enzyme (ACE or renin) protein structure to change the active conformation and lead to decreased catalysis. The results of this study indicate that WPH, especially <1 kDa peptide, can be used as a component in formulating antihypertensive functional foods and nutraceuticals, thus improving the industrial production efficiency and bioavailability of wheat bran.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669899>Oxidation of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) by peroxymonosulfate: The role of in-situ formed HOBr.</a></h2><p>The degradation of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), one of the most widely used brominated flame retardant, was evaluated during peroxymonosulfate (PMS) oxidation. TBBPA degradation was pH-dependent, with peak degradation rate constants occurring at pH 8.0-9.0, which was distinct from some other phenolic compounds. Singlet  and radicals were found to play negligible roles in TBBPA degradation. TBBPA oxidation by PMS mainly proceeded via a direct oxidation pathway and the in-situ formed HOBr was found to greatly accelerate its degradation rates. The values of species-specific second-order rate constants for the reactions of PMS with the TBBPA k, k and k were determined to be (1.11 ± 0.84) × 10, (8.05 ± .31) × 10, and (1.34 ± 0.25) × 10 M s, respectively, while the reaction rate constants for HOBr/OBr with TBBPA k, k, kand k were determined to be (9.38 ± .10) × 10, (1.59 ± 0.56) × 10, (8.22 ± 0.41) × 10, and (1.81 ± 0.12) × 10 M s, respectively. The bromine mass balance analysis showed that bromide ion and HOBr/OBr occupied 19.5% of total Br and brominated organic compounds accounted for the remaining percentages at pH 7.0. No formation of bromate was observed. Based on the identified products, a reaction pathway was proposed, which included oxidation, β-scission, hydroxylation, and dimerization reaction pathways. The results indicate that unactivated PMS is useful for the remediation of TBBPA contaminated water.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The energy (γ) of the terminal surface having only Ba cations, indicated the surface to be the most stable (γ = 6.7 kJ mol-1 Å-) as compared to the other surfaces. MD simulations elaborated on the cation disorder in the near surface region where Ba cations in the subsurface region were observed to migrate towards the surface. This led to a disruption in cation ordering with a propensity to form multiphases in the near surface region. In the near surface zone,  anion diffusivity was observed to be reduced by an order of magnitude (D = 1.6 × 10-11 cm2 s-1 at 873 K) as compared to the bulk  anion diffusivity value (D = 1.96 × 10-10 cm2 s-1 at 873 K). A novel idea was then proposed to control the degree of surface segregation of Ba cations by applying nanostructuring of the GBCO material in the form of nanoparticles. MD simulations elucidated that the near surface region having a high degree of cation disorder in the nanostructured GBCO may regain back the  anion diffusivity value (D = 3.98 × 10-10 cm2 s-1, at 873 K) comparable to the bulk core region (D = .51 × 10-10 cm2 s-1, at 873 K). A proof of concept experiment was setup to test this hypothesis. The electrochemical performance of the electrode, fabricated using GBCO nanoparticles, was measured to improve by 15% as compared to the electrode synthesized with a bulk size GBCO material. This was attributed to the control in Ba-cation segregation, obtained on nanostructuring which resulted in higher  anion transport in the near-surface region of the electrode material. XPS characterization of the surface of the nanostructured GBCO materials supported this assertion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679334></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665912>Combination treatment of autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation and hyperbaric  therapy for type  diabetes mellitus: A randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to compare standard treatment versus the combination of intrapancreatic autologous stem cell (ASC) infusion and hyperbaric  treatment (HBOT) before and after ASC in the metabolic control of patients with type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Twenty-eight females were allocated to PBC (30 sec at -60°C,  min at -135°C), CWI (10 min at 10°C) or CON (10 min resting). Muscle  saturation (SmO ), cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and local skin temperature were assessed at baseline and through 60 min (10 min intervals), while delayed-onset of muscle soreness (DOMS), muscle swelling, maximum-voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and vertical jump performance (VJP) were assessed up to 72 h (24 h intervals) following treatments. SmO was lower in PBC (Δ-.77±13.08%) and CWI (Δ-5.91±11.80%) compared to CON (Δ18.96±1.46%) throughout the 60 min follow-up period (p<0.001). CVC was lower from PBC (92.7±25.0%, 90.5±23.4%) and CWI (90.3±23.5%, 88.1±22.9%) compared to CON (119.0±5.1, 116.1±6.6% respectively) between 20 and 30 min (p<0.05). Mean skin temperature was lower from CWI vs. PBC (between 10 to 40 min, p<0.05). Mean skin temperature was higher in CON compared to CWI up to 60 min and compared to PBC up to 30 min (p<0.05). DOMS was lower following both PBC and CWI compared to CON through 72-h (p<0.05), with no difference between groups. No main group differences for swelling, MVIC and VJP were observed. In conclusion, CWI elicited generally greater physiological effects compared to PBC whilst both interventions were more effective than CON in reducing DOMS in females, but had no effect on functional measures or swelling.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that an increase in dietary saturated fat could lead to abnormalities of calcium homeostasis and heart rhythm by a NOX2 (NADPH oxidase )-dependent mechanism.We investigated this hypothesis by feeding mice high-fat diets. In vivo heart rhythm telemetry, optical mapping, and isolated cardiac myocyte imaging were used to quantify arrhythmias, repolarization, calcium transients, and intracellular calcium sparks.We found that saturated fat activates NOX (NADPH oxidase), whereas polyunsaturated fat does not. The high saturated fat diet increased repolarization heterogeneity and ventricular tachycardia inducibility in perfused hearts. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of NOX2 prevented arrhythmogenic abnormalities in vivo during high statured fat diet and resulted in less inducible ventricular tachycardia. High saturated fat diet activates CaMK (Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase) in the heart, which contributes to abnormal calcium handling, promoting arrhythmia.We conclude that NOX2 deletion or pharmacological inhibition prevents the arrhythmogenic effects of a high saturated fat diet, in part mediated by activation of CaMK. This work reveals a molecular mechanism linking cardiac metabolism to arrhythmia and suggests that NOX2 inhibitors could be a novel therapy for heart rhythm abnormalities caused by cardiac lipid overload.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669873>Landfill leachate as an additional substance in the Johannesburg-Sulfur autotrophic denitrification system in the treatment of municipal wastewater with low strength and low COD/TN ratio.</a></h2><p>Johannesburg-Sulfur autotrophic denitrification (JHB-SAD) system was investigated for the combined treatment of leachate and municipal wastewater with low strength and low COD/TN ratio.

Three of these complexes were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, [VIVO(PIMH)], [VIVO(PIMBr)] and [VIVO(PIMNO2)], as well as a dioxidovanadium(v) compound ([VVO2(PIMH)(PIMH2)]). The complexes were tested for their catalytic activities in the oxidation of dibenzothiophene (DBT), the major refractory organosulfur compound found in fuel. The nitro substituted compound [VIVO(PIMNO2)] had the highest catalytic oxidation activity followed by: [VIVO(PIMH)] > [VIVO(PIMBr)] > [VIVO(PIMMeO)]. The decrease in activity is attributed to the different electronegativities of the substituent groups, which influence the electron density on the metal center, the V[double bond, length as m-dash]O bond distances and infrared stretching bands. Geometry index (τ) values calculated from single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) data and DFT studies provided further insights on the trend in activity observed. SC-XRD, EPR, 51V NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopies, and DFT studies were instrumental in studying the mechanism of the catalyzed reaction and proposal of intermediate species.

Therefore, we wondered whether rifampicin has a beneficial effect such as an anti-oxidant in the liver, because the efficacy of some drugs sometimes relates with their toxicity as well as protective effects. The present study aimed to investigate the antioxidant effect of rifampicin against arachidonic acid (AA) plus iron (AA + iron) cotreatment and against acetaminophen (APAP, 500 mg/kg)-induced oxidative stress, in vitro and in vivo, respectively. In vivo, oral administration of rifampicin (100 or 200 mg/kg) attenuated elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), serum liver injury markers, against APAP treatment and, histologically, ameliorated tissue damage. Under in vitro examination, MTT assays were used to assess the cell death inhibitory effect of rifampicin against AA + iron-induced oxidative stress. In addition, DCFH-DA and Rh 123 staining showed that rifampicin treatment reduced reactive  species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane damage, which had been induced by AA + iron treatment. Further, we explored whether rifampicin treatment enhanced phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by activation of liver kinase B1 (LKB1), the upstream kinase of AMPKα. Activated AMPKα induced activation of nuclear factor erythroid -related factor  (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which are proteins functioning in redox balance. Moreover, we confirmed a reversed cell protective effect of rifampicin under compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) treatment.

Herein, particulate matter (PM) emitted from artisanal cashew nut roasting, an important economic activity worldwide, was investigated. This study focused on: i) chemical characterization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oxygenated (oxy-) PAHs; ii) intracellular levels of reactive  species (ROS); iii) genotoxic effects and time- and dose-dependent activation of DNA damage signaling, and iv) differential expression of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, inflammation, cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, using A549 lung cells. Among the PAHs, chrysene, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), benzo[b]fluoranthene, and benz[a]anthracene showed the highest concentrations (7.8-10 ng/m), while benzanthrone and 9,10-anthraquinone were the most abundant oxy-PAHs. Testing of PM extracts was based on B[a]P equivalent doses (B[a]P). IC values for viability were 5.7 and 3.0 nM B[a]P at 24 h and 48 h, respectively. At these low doses, we observed a time- and dose-dependent increase in intracellular levels of ROS, genotoxicity (DNA strand breaks) and DNA damage signaling (phosphorylation of the protein checkpoint kinase 1 - Chk1). In comparison, effects of B[a]P alone was observed at micromolar range. To our knowledge, no previous study has demonstrated an activation of pChk1, a biomarker used to estimate the carcinogenic potency of PAHs in vitro, in lung cells exposed to cashew nut roasting extracts. Sustained induction of expression of several important stress response mediators of xenobiotic metabolism (CYP1A1, CYP1B1), ROS and pro-inflammatory response (IL-8, TNF-α, IL-, COX2), and DNA damage response (CDKN1A and DDB2) was also identified. In conclusion, our data show high potency of cashew nut roasting PM to induce cellular stress including genotoxicity, and more potently when compared to B[a]P alone.

Nuclear erythroid-related factor- (Nrf2) is a transcriptional regulator of several phase II antioxidant genes, including glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL). In this study, it was hypothesized that Crocin may mediate antioxidant signaling pathway to protect human lung epithelial cells against CS-mediated toxicity and oxidative stress via inducing glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis and activation of Nrf2 pathway. Alveolar epithelial cells (A549) were exposed to 1, .5 and 5% cigarette smoke extracts (CSE) with or without Crocin (500 μM). After 48 h exposure, the cytotoxicity, oxidant/antioxidant parameters and the Nrf2 pathway modification were assayed. Treatment of A549 cells with all concentrations of CSE dose dependently decreased cell viability, antioxidant levels, GCL and Nrf2 gene expression, which was associated with increased production of reactive  species. Crocin not only restored CSE-depleted GSH levels by enhancing GCL expression via activation of Nrf2 but also quenched the CSE-generation and release of reactive  species. Crocin attenuated CSE-mediated Nrf2 modifications, thereby inducing its nuclear accumulation associated with GCL gene transcription leading to enhanced GSH levels. By inducing GSH synthesis, Crocin attenuates CSE-mediated GSH depletion and protects cells against CSE-induced oxidative stress via Nrf2 pathway.

A complete pulmonary function test (PFT) was completed the day before and immediately after immersion. FeNO was measured using a Nobreath™ Quark (COSMED™, Rome, Italy), three times for each diver. The first datapoint was collected before the dive to establish the "basal state", a second was collected immediately after divers emerged from the water, and the final measurement was taken 24 h after the dive.Despite prolonged inhalation of a hyperoxic hyperbaric gas mixture, no clinical pulmonary symptoms were observed, and no major changes in pulmonary function were detected. However, a major decrease in FeNO values was observed immediately after emersion [0-12 ppb (median, 3.8 ppb)], with a return to baseline [-60 ppb (median, 26 ppb) 24 h later (3-73 ppb (median, 24.7 ppb)].These results suggest that if the OTU remain below the recommended limit values, but does alter FeNO, this type of dive does not persistently impair lung function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677268>Is there an optimal irradiation dose for PDT: 37 Jcm or 75 Jcm ?</a></h2><p>Topical photodynamic therapy (PDT) is widely used for the treatment of Bowen's disease (BD) and superficial basal cell carcinoma (BCC).

Herein, an innovative solution was proposed using a three-stage Simultaneous Ammonium oxidation Denitrifying (SAD) process. Firstly, ammonia (1760 ± 126 mg N/L) in wastewater was oxidized to nitrite in a partial nitrification sequencing batch reactor (PN-SBR). Next, 93% PN-SBR effluent and concentrated external waste activated sludge (WAS; MLSS = 23057 ± 6014 mg/L) were introduced to an anoxic reactor for integrated fermentation and denitrification (IFD-SBR). Finally, ammonia (101.4 ± 13.8 mg N/L) released by fermentation in the IFD-SBR and residual 7% nitrite in the PN-SBR were removed through the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process in the SAD up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (SAD-UASB). In addition, NO-N generation during the anammox process could be reduced to nitrite by partial denitrification (PD) and reused as substrate for anammox. A satisfactory total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency (98.3%), external sludge reduction rate (.5 kg/m d) and effluent TN concentration (16.7 mg/L) were achieved after long-term operation (280 days). The IFD-SBR and SAD-UASB contributed to 81.9% and 12.3% nitrogen removal, respectively. Microbial analysis showed that anammox bacteria (1.5% Candidatus Brocadia) cooperated well with partial denitrifying bacteria (4.3% Thauera) in SAD-UASB, and average nitrogen removal contribution were 83.1% during significant stability of anammox and 9.% during the denitrification process, respectively. The three-stage SAD process provides an environmental and economic approach for landfill leachate treatment since it has the advantage of 25.4% less , 100% organic matter savings and 47.9% less external sludge than traditional biological processes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

An investigation to characterize current health monitoring devices was carried out in the laboratory using widely accepted clinical and industry criteria. In total, 16 unique devices were examined. These devices were assessed according to their sensing modalities: step count, blood pressure, body temperature, electrocardiogram, blood  saturation, and respiratory rate. Devices were tested at rest and immediately following exercise. Our results revealed that only four devices meet target requirements for accuracy. The AliveCor, a portable ECG monitor, accurately detected the heart rate for 87% of all recordings. To meet the target criterion for accuracy, the heart rate must be within ± 5 beats/minute or 10% of the standard measurement, whichever is lower. The Withings Pulse Ox, the Tinké, and the Santamedical SM-110 measured blood  saturation with .1, .6, and 1.4 root-mean-square (rms) error, respectively. For blood  saturation, the device should demonstrate rms error of < 3%. However, the Withings Pulse Ox and the Tinké failed to meet the accuracy criteria for their alternative biosensing capabilities: step count and respiratory rate, respectively.

The concern on environmental risks, stemming from the use of chemical pesticides acting as nematicides, compels to their replacement with more sustainable pest control strategies. To verify the effect of aqueous extracts of the agro-industry waste coffee silverskin (CS) and brewers' spent grain (BSG) on the widespread root-knot nematode , and on the physiology of tomato plants, a pot experiment was carried out in a glasshouse at 25 ±  °C. The possible phytotoxicity of CS and BSG extracts was assessed on garden cress seeds. Tomato plants (landrace of Apulia Region) were transplanted in an artificial nematode infested soil with an initial population density of 3.17 eggs and juveniles/mL soil. CS and BSG were applied at rates of 50 and 100 % (1L/pot). Untreated and Fenamiphos EC 240 (nematicide) (0.01 μL a.i./mL soil) treated plants were used as controls. Reactive  species (ROS) and chlorophyll content of tomato plants were estimated during the experiment. CS extract, at both doses, significantly reduced nematode population in comparison to the untreated control, although it was less effective than Fenamiphos. BSG extract did not reduce final nematode population compared to the control. Ten days after the first treatment, CS 100 %, BSG 50 % and BSG 100% elicited the highest ROS values, which considerably affected the growth of tomato plants in comparison to the untreated plants. The control of these pests is meeting with difficulties because of the current national and international regulations in force, which are limiting the use of synthetic nematicides. Therefore, CS extracts could assume economic relevance, as alternative products to be used in sustainable strategies for nematode management.© 2019 N. Thligene, G. N. Mezzapesa, D. Mondelli, A.

However, the difference in cardiac autonomic activity in OSA patients according to position dependency has not been evaluated. This study aimed to evaluate the differences between positional OSA (pOSA) and nonpositional OSA (npOSA) using heart rate variability (HRV) analysis.This was a single-center cross-sectional study. Twenty-eight patients with npOSA and 28 age-, sex-, and AHI-matched patients with pOSA underwent standard polysomnography. A five-minute R-R interval from stable waking conditions before bedtime was collected from each subject and analyzed for HRV.Patients with pOSA had lower body-mass index (BMI, 25.8 ± .9 vs 28.9 ± 3.7 kg/m, p = 0.001), shorter apnea duration (24.1 ± 7.1 vs 30.3 ± 12.7 s, p = 0.028) and higher minimum  saturation (78. ± 7.1 vs 71.5 ± 11.4%, p = 0.011) than those with npOSA. HRV analysis showed higher parasympathetic activity in pOSA patients than in npOSA patients, including a higher square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent NN intervals (RMSSD, 31.3 ± 29.0 vs 18.6 ± 9., p = 0.032), percentage of pairs of adjacent NN intervals that differ by more than 50 ms (pNN50%, 10.7 ± 17.1 vs 3.3 ± 6.5, p = 0.024), and high-frequency (HF) power (534.7 ± 986.8 vs 146.7 ± 150.5, p = 0.026). The group difference was insignificant after adjusting for age and BMI. The log-transformed supine/nonsupine AHI ratio was the sole independent predictor of HRV parameters.The waking HRV was higher in pOSA patients than in npOSA patients due to the lower BMI of pOSA patients. The difference was especially apparent in parasympathetic indices. Higher parasympathetic activity in pOSA may suggest a lower risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Perspectives and pitfalls.</a></h2><p>Complex I (CI or NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) deficiency is the most frequent cause of mitochondrial respiratory chain defect. Successful attempts to rescue CI function by introducing an exogenous NADH dehydrogenase, such as the NDI1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScNDI1), have been reported although with drawbacks related to competition with CI. In contrast to ScNDI1, which is permanently active in yeast naturally devoid of CI, plant alternative NADH dehydrogenases (NDH-) support the oxidation of NADH only when the CI is metabolically inactive and conceivably when the concentration of matrix NADH exceeds a certain threshold. We therefore explored the feasibility of CI rescue by NDH- from Arabidopsis thaliana (At) in human CI defective fibroblasts.We showed that, other than ScNDI1, two different NDH- (AtNDA2 and AtNDB4) targeted to the mitochondria were able to rescue CI deficiency and decrease oxidative stress as indicated by a normalization of SOD activity in human CI-defective fibroblasts. We further demonstrated that when expressed in human control fibroblasts, AtNDA2 shows an affinity for NADH oxidation similar to that of CI, thus competing with CI for the oxidation of NADH as opposed to our initial hypothesis. This competition reduced the amount of ATP produced per  atom reduced to water by half in control cells.In conclusion, despite their promising potential to rescue CI defects, due to a possible competition with remaining CI activity, plant NDH- should be regarded with caution as potential therapeutic tools for human mitochondrial diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667898>Hyperbaric  Therapy for Non-Ischemic Diabetic Ulcers: A Systematic Review.</a></h2><p>Diabetic foot ulcers are a common complication of diabetes, which affects 25% of patients and may ultimately lead to amputation of affected limbs. Research suggests hyperbaric  therapy improves healing of these ulcers. However, this has not been reflected in previous reviews, possibly because they did not differentiate between patients with and without peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Therefore, we performed a systematic review of published literature in the MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL databases on non-ischemic diabetic foot ulcers with outcome measures including complete ulcer healing, amputation rate (major and minor) and mortality. Seven studies were included, of which two were randomized clinical trials. Two studies found no difference in major amputation rate, whereas one large retrospective study found % more major amputations in the hyperbaric  group. However, this study did not correct for baseline differences. Two studies showed no significant difference in minor amputation rate. Five studies reporting on complete wound healing showed no significant differences. In conclusion, the current evidence suggests that hyperbaric  therapy does not accelerate wound healing and does not prevent major or minor amputations in patients with a diabetic foot ulcer without peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Based on the available evidence, routine clinical use of this therapy cannot be recommended. However, the available research for this specific subgroup of patients is scarce, and physicians should counsel patients on expected risks and benefits. Additional research, focusing especially on patient selection criteria, is needed to better identify patients that might profit from this therapy modality. This article is protected by copyright.

In this work, the micro-environment controlled chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method has been adopted to synthesize high-quality single-crystalline CsPbBr3 microstructures, including microwires, microplates and triangular pyramids. Moreover, the structure-activity relationship between the material microstructures and the device properties is illustrated. The results show that photodetectors based on a single horizontal CsPbBr3 microwire exhibit a high responsivity (312. A W-1) and a fast response time of 5.8 ms. Photodetectors based on a single CsPbBr3 microplate exhibit a responsivity of 1.74 A W-1 and a response of 10 ms. These results indicate that the CsPbBr3 microwire photodetector is characterized by a higher photodetector performance when compared to the microplate due to its excellent crystallization quality and the Fabry-Pérot cavity effect in the microwire. Furthermore, the flexible CsPbBr3 microwire photodetector was demonstrated on a mica substrate. The results show that the photocurrent can be maintained at 90% after 3000 cycles at a bending radius of .5 mm. This work demonstrates the structure-activity photodetector performance, which is essential to develop a full understanding about high-performance optoelectronic devices based on all-inorganic lead halide perovskite materials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666212>Experimental approaches for identifying the impact of enhanced flotation technology using hollow microspheres.</a></h2><p>Hollow microspheres should be characterized in terms of physicochemical aspects to understand the flotation effect principle. There have been insufficient studies on the effect of hollow microspheres in water treatment in terms of flotation. In this study, various analytical and experimental approaches were utilized to identify the flotation characteristics and understand the effect of hollow microspheres on flotation. These approaches included analytical methods such as particle count and zeta potential measurements, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, a floc breakage experiment, and a collision efficiency model. The hollow microspheres were spherical shape with an average size of 50 μm. The microspheres were identified to have a higher negative charge (-69.1 mV) than microbubbles (-51.1 and -30.5 mV). The binding energy of Si-O from the hollow microspheres showed the highest peak at 103.18 eV and 61,503.7 counts/s. Si-O binding structure and the molecular structure of the SiO series were considered to be a structure in which Si is bonded to  ion. The optimum floc breakage condition was determined to be 15 min. The number of particles increased because the average particle size is increased with the concentration of hollow microspheres injection. The turbulent flocculation (TF) model was confirmed to be consentient to the experimental data in comparison with the white-water bubble blanket (WWBB) model. As a result, the hollow microspheres had the characteristic of increasing floc size so that flocs can be floated easily.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Icariin has been shown to exert a protective effect on human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and accordingly has implications for the prevention and treatment of IVDD; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its action are not fully established. In this study, the mechanisms underlying its protection against hydrogen peroxide (HO)-induced oxidative stress injury were investigated. In vitro, we demonstrated that icariin inhibits HO-induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. It upregulates oxidative stress mediators, i.e., reactive  species, and downregulates mitochondrial membrane potential. Nuclear factor erythroid -related factor  (Nrf-) is a key factor involved in the regulation of the endogenous defense system. It was proved that icariin could activate the Nrf- signaling pathway, upregulate the protein expression of nuclear respiratory factor-1 and the mitochondrial transcription factor, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis in human NP cells. An Nrf- agonist and inhibitor promoted or partly abolished the protective effects of icariin on mitochondrial homeostasis. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the Nrf- signaling pathway could be inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/AKT pathway. In vivo, icariin ameliorated IVDD in a rat model by promoting Nrf- activity, and preserving extracellular matrix in NP cells. These data suggest that icariin could ameliorate IVDD in rat models in vivo. In summary, the protective effects of icariin on human NP cells may suppress the pathogenesis of IVDD via the Nrf- signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that the Nrf- signaling pathway is a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of IVDD.Copyright © 2019.

Oxidative stress is a common problem observed in carcinogenesis and it is involved in developing treatment resistance. Nuclear Factor Erythroid--Like  (Nrf2) transcription factor is the main regulator of antioxidant responses. The levels of reactive  species (ROS) are tightly controlled and regulated by Nrf2 and its suppressor protein Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Recently, many studies have shown that most of the genes in the Nrf2/Keap1/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB)/phosphotyrosine-independent ligand for the Lck SH2 domain Of 62 KDa (p62) pathway show abnormally high mutational variations in cancer. However, variations in the Nrf2/Keap1/NF-κB1/p62 pathway in pediatric ALL have not been thoroughly investigated, yet. Thirty children, who were diagnosed with pediatirc ALL were included in the study. The Nrf2/Keap1/NF-κB1/p62 pathway variants were analyzed by DNA sequencing analysis. The PolyPhen- program was used for identifying pathogenic mutations. Our study examined the molecular dynamics (MD) perspectives of the effect of A159T and E121K mutations on protein stability for the first time in the literature by using the GROMACS45 software package utilizing the OPSLAA force field. Of the detected 17 nucleotide changes, 6 were novel. The study predicted the potential pathological effect of two mutations p. A159T and p.E121K in the Keap1 gene. The MD perspectives revealed that the E121K mutant's observed structural behavior accounted for the key role of His-129 and E121K, where E121K exhibited much higher drift compared to His-129. For a future perspective, it would be meaningful to study the protein-small molecule interactions of the Keap1 protein to elaborate on the drug effects in patients carrying these mutations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679905></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659418>Cinnamaldehyde inhibits Candida albicans growth by causing apoptosis and its treatment on vulvovaginal candidiasis and oropharyngeal candidiasis.</a></h2><p>The invasion of Candida albicans is one of the most common fungal infections seen in clinical practice, and serious drug resistance has been reported in recent years. Therefore, new anti-C. albicans drugs must be introduced. In this research, it was demonstrated that cinnamaldehyde (CA) shows strong antimicrobial activity, with 0.26 mg/mL CA being the minimum inhibitory concentration to manage C. albicans. Extraordinarily, we detected that CA accumulated the intracellular reactive  species (ROS) and enhanced the calcium concentration in the cytoplasm and mitochondria through flow cytometry. In addition, we observed that C. albicans cells released Cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential, and activated the metacaspase when exposed to 0.065, 0.13, 0.26, and 0.52 mg/mL CA. Furthermore, to confirm that CA introduces the C. albicans apoptosis, we discovered that when the phosphatidylserine was exposed, DNA damage and chromatin condensation occurred, which were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and 4',6-diamidino--phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Finally, demonstrations of phenotype investigation, colony-forming unit (CFU) counts, and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining were conducted to prove that CA possessed the ability to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC).

However, long-term dynamic changes of LDs and their relative activity remain unclear. Here, an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) probe named -DPAN was prepared and employed to visualize dynamic processes of LDs in a 6-hydroxydopamine model of PD for the first time, and LDs' accumulation-peak/plateau-decrease were confirmed. We further found a close relationship between LDs and variation in mitochondrial activity. Strikingly, the progression of cell death was accelerated by lipase, whereas pre-stimulation of LDs by unsaturated fatty acid-oleic acid decreased the death process by inhibiting excessive reactive  species (ROS) and fatty acid production, thereby protecting mitochondria. The utilization of -DPAN demonstrates the importance of LDs in neuronal homeostasis, and effective tuning of LDs may prevent or inhibit PD progression.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Toxicity increased as increasing the number of carbons in the alkyl-chain of imidazolium-based ILs, with EC values from 4.19 to 0.17 for 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Emim][Cl]) and 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Omim][Cl]), respectively. An increase in toxicity was observed for aromatic-based ILs (pyridinium- and imidazolium-based ILs) due to the hydrophobic character of the head groups in comparison with linear structures as phosphonium and ammonium cations. Among to the anions studied fixing [Emim] as cation, [HSO] and [NTf] presented low EC values (0.34 mM and 1.69 mM, respectively) while [Cl] and [EtSO] were considered harmless anions due to the hydrophilic character of chloride and the organic nature of [EtSO]. ILs toxicity/inhibition was determined by adding a biodegradable compound and measuring the sludge response after being in contact with the ILs for at least 15 h. The exposure of sewage sludge to ILs for more than 15 min used in short inhibition assays caused more toxic effect on microorganisms, even for [Choline][NTf], previously defined as practically harmless (EC = .79 mM). Biodegradability assays confirmed the biodegradable nature of choline cation, related with TOC conversion of 40%, only due to cation consumption. No  consumption or even lysis of microbial cells was observed for Tetrabutylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide and for 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogensulphate due to the presence of anions previously defined as hazardous ([NTf] and [HSO]), maintaining their recalcitrant character to sewage systems.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Exercise capacity was similar in men and women (percent predicted peak  [O2] consumption: 66% in women vs 68% in men; P = .38), but women had distinct deficits in components of the O2 pathway, including worse biventricular systolic reserve (multivariable-adjusted analyses: ΔLVEF β = -1.70; SE, 0.86; P < .05; ΔRVEF β = -.39, SE=0.80; P = .003), diastolic reserve (PCWP/CO: β = 0.63; SE, 0.31; P = .04), and peripheral O2 extraction (C(a-v)O2 β=-0.90, SE=0.22; P < .001)).Despite a lower burden of cardiometabolic disease and a similar percent predicted exercise capacity, women with HFpEF demonstrated greater cardiac and extracardiac deficits, including systolic reserve, diastolic reserve, and peripheral O2 extraction. These sex differences in cardiac and skeletal muscle responses to exercise may illuminate the pathophysiology underlying the development of HFpEF and should be investigated further.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669878>Progressive anemia of prematurity is associated with a critical increase in cerebral  extraction.</a></h2><p>Elevated cerebral fractional tissue  extraction (cFTOE) is an adaptation to anemia of prematurity (AOP). cFTOE ≥0.4 is associated with brain injury in infants ≤30 weeks. This longitudinal study sought to investigate the utility of cFTOE in the evaluation of AOP.Infants ≤30 weeks estimated gestational age (EGA) underwent weekly hemoglobin, cerebral saturation, and pulse oximetry recordings from the second through 36 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA). Recordings were excluded if they were under 1 h or if hemoglobin was not measured within 7 days of recording. Mean cFTOE was calculated for each recording. Statistical analysis used linear mixed-effects modeling and receiver operating characteristic analysis.144 recordings from 39 infants (mean EGA 27.6 ± . weeks, BW 1139 ± 286 g) were included of whom 39% (15/39) were transfused. The mean recording length was .8 ± 1.3 h. There was a significant negative correlation between hemoglobin and cFTOE (R = -0.423, p ≤.001). In a multivariate model, adjusting for EGA, PMA, and patent ductus arteriosus treatment the AUC was 0.821. A critical increase in cFTOE occurred at a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL.AOP is associated with a critical increase in cFTOE that occurs at a significantly higher hemoglobin level than standard clinical thresholds for transfusion.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The search for an alternative treatment of infections caused by E. faecalis, without using antibiotics, is off great clinical importance. The aim of present investigation was to assess the efficacy of using 3.32 ηg/mL of 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) as photosensitizer associated with the use of either Laser (λ660 nm) or LED (λ632 ±  nm) using different energy densities (6, 12 and 18 J/cm) to kill E. faecalis in vitro. Under different experimental conditions, 14 study groups, in triplicate, were used to compare the efficacy of the aPDT carried out with either the laser or LED lights using different energy densities associated to DMMB. The most probable number method (MPN) was used for quantitative analysis. Photodynamic antimicrobial effectiveness was directly proportional to the energy density used, reaching at 18 J/cm, 99.999998% reduction of the counts of E. faecalis using both light sources. The results of this study showed that the use of 3.32 ηg/mL of DMMB associated with the use 18 J/cm of LED light (λ632 ±  nm) reduced >7-log counts of planktonic culture of E. faecalis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

When the influent TS concentration increased from 7.04 to 15.5 g/L, the methane gas production rate increased from 0.45 to 0.92 L-CH/L/day. However, with the influent TS concentration of food waste (FW) further increased to 23.5 g/L, a large amount of scum formed and accumulated in the SDSAR. According to the result of chemical  demand (COD) recovery, the proportion of COD remained in the effluent at different TS concentrations was only around %. On the other hand, with an increase in TS concentration, the proportion of COD remained in the reactors increased significantly. Our results demonstrated that effluent from the integrated system can meet the water quality requirements recommended by Japan Sewage Works Association (JSWA) for wastewater from FWD.

Animals used in this study were categorized into four groups. The first group was treated with sodium carboxymethylcellulose (0.3%; CMC-Na) solution. The second group received Dox (3.0 mg/kg, i.p.) on days 6, 12, 18, and 24. The third and fourth groups received Dox (3 mg/kg, i.p.) on days 6, 12, 18, and 24 and received protective doses of genistein (100 [group 3] and 200 [group 4] mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 30 days. Treatment with genistein significantly improved the altered cardiac function markers and oxidative stress markers. This was coupled with significant improvement in cardiac histopathological features. Genistein enhanced the Nrf2 and HO-1 expression, which showed protection against oxidative insult induced by Dox. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay showed substantial inhibition of apoptosis by genistein in myocardia. The study showed that genistein has a strong reactive  species scavenging property and potentially (P ≤ .001) decreases the lipid peroxidation as well as inhibits DNA damage in cardiac toxicity induced by Dox. In conclusion, the potential antioxidant effect of genistein may be because of its modulatory effect on Nrf2/HO-1 signalling pathway and by this means exhibits cardioprotective effects from Dox-induced oxidative injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674182>The Stability of the Complex and the Basicity of the Anion Impact the Selectivity and Affinity of Tripodal Gadolinium Complexes for Anions.</a></h2><p>The affinities and selectivities of lanthanide complexes with open coordination sites for anions vary considerably with the chelate. In order to determine the effect of the stability of a lanthanide complex on its affinity for anions, five different complexes featuring different bidentate chelating moieties were synthesized, and their affinity for anions in water at neutral pH were evaluated by longitudinal relaxometry measurements. The chelates comprise both  and nitrogen donors including maltol, 1,-hydroxypyridinone, hydroxamic acid, pyridin--ylmethanol, and carbamoylmethylphosphonate diester. They were chosen to span a range of basicities all the while maintaining a similar tripodal tris-bidentate architecture, thereby allowing for a direct study of the role of the coordinating motif on the supramolecular recognition of anions by the corresponding Gd complex. Overall, for ligands containing the same number of protonation steps, and therefore the same charge at neutral pH, the lower the acidity of the chelate (higher ∑p's), the less stable the corresponding Gd complex, and the higher its affinity for anions. Regardless of the number of protonation steps, the more stable Gd complexes form ternary or quaternary assemblies with coordinating anions. In contrast, the same anions readily displace the chelate of the least stable complexes, resulting instead in the formation of Gd·anion precipitates. Irrespective of the chelate, in the absence of steric hindrance at the open coordination site, the affinity of Gd complexes for anions follows the order phosphate > arsenate > bicarbonate > fluoride. Hence, the selectivity and affinity of Gd complexes of tripodal tris-bidentate chelates for anions is a function of the stability of the Gd complex and the basicity of the anion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665070>The effect of low dose marine protein hydrolysates on short-term recovery after high intensity performance cycling: a double-blinded crossover study.</a></h2><p>Knowledge of the effect of marine protein hydrolysate (MPH) supplementation to promote recovery after high intensity performance training is scarce. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of MPH supplementation to whey protein (WP) and carbohydrate (CHO): (CHO-WP-MPH), on short-term recovery following high intensity performance, compared to an isoenergetic and isonitrogenous supplement of WP and CHO: (CHO-WP), in male cyclists.This was a double-blinded crossover study divided into three phases. Fourteen healthy men participated. In phase I, an incremental bicycle exercise test was performed for establishment of intensities used in phase II and III. In phase II (9-16 days after phase 1), the participants performed first one high intensity performance cycling session, followed by nutrition supplementation (CHO-WP-MPH or CHO-WP) and 4 hours of recovery, before a subsequent high intensity performance cycling session. Phase III (1 week after phase II), was similar to phase II except for the nutrition supplementation, where the participants received the opposite supplementation compared to phase II. Primary outcome was difference in time to exhaustion between the cycling sessions, after nutrition supplementations containing MPH or without MPH. Secondary outcomes were differences in heart rate (HR), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), blood lactate concentration and glucose.The mean age of the participants was 45.6 years (range 40-58). The maximal  uptake (mean ± SD) measured at baseline was 54.7 ± 4.1 ml∙min∙kg. There were no significant differences between the two nutrition supplementations measured by time to exhaustion at the cycling sessions (mean = 0.85 min, p = 0.156, 95% confidence interval (CI), - 0.37, .06), HR (mean = 0.8 beats pr.min, p = 0.331, 95% CI, - 0.9, .5), RER (mean = - 0.05, p = 0.361, 95% CI -0.07 - 0.17), blood lactate concentration (mean = - 0.24, p = 0.511, 95% CI, - 1.00, 0.53) and glucose (mean = 0.23, p = 0.094, 95% CI, - 0.05, 0.51).A protein supplement with MPH showed no effects on short-term recovery in middle-aged healthy male cyclists compared to a protein supplement without MPH.The study was registered 02.05.2017 at ClinicalTrials.gov (Protein Supplements to Cyclists,  , https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/?cond=marine+peptides&rank=1 .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678753>γ-Oryzanol suppresses cell apoptosis by inhibiting reactive  species-mediated mitochondrial signaling pathway in HO-stimulated L02 cells.</a></h2><p>γ-Oryzanol, a mixture of ferulic acid esters of plant sterols and triterpene alcohols existed in rice bran oil, can ameliorate lipid metabolism and enhance antioxidant activity. In this study, we used hydrogen peroxide (HO)-induced injury in human hepatic L02 cells to investigate the mechanisms involved in the hepatoprotective activity of γ-oryzanol. The injuries produced by HO in L02 cells include increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and intracellular reactive  species (ROS), decreased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), increased protein expressions of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and induced apoptosis. Pretreatment with γ-oryzanol enhanced the ROS scavenging activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and decreased lipid peroxidation in HO treated cells. Moreover, pretreatment with γ-oryzanol inhibited HO-induced apoptosis by restoring MMP, upregulating the expression ratio of Bcl-/Bax, and inhibiting the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. These findings show that γ-oryzanol can prevent HO-induced apoptosis by suppressing intracellular accumulation of ROS and impeding ROS-activated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

On account of the correlation between PDT and photocatalytic oxidation, the hollow MoSe2/Fe3O4 (MF-) nanoheterostructure was constructed to enhance PDT in this paper. The size and the hollow structure can well controlled by the addition of F-127. MoSe2/Fe3O4 reveals the -fold reactive  species (ROS) generation in contrast to the pure MoSe2, ascribed to the effective separation of photogenic charges. The novel hollow structure also supplies plenty cavity for perfluorocarbon (PFC) and O2 loading, and O2@PFC@MF- can effective overcome the hypoxic microenvironment to further cause more than 3 times ROS production. Moreover, the narrow band gap and hollow structure also make sure the strong Near-infrared (NIR)light absorption and high photothermal conversion efficiency as high as 66.%. Furthermore, the combination of Fe3O4 can further accelerate the effective biodegradation capacity of MF- due to the repeated endogenous redox reaction to form water-soluble MoVI-oxide species.

Despite extensive research in animal models and numerous promising treatment trials, there is still no curative treatment for AD. Astrocytes, the most common cell type of the central nervous system, have been shown to play a role in the major AD pathologies, including accumulation of amyloid plaques, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Here, we show that inflammatory stimulation leads to metabolic activation of human astrocytes and reduces amyloid secretion. On the other hand, the activation of oxidative metabolism leads to increased reactive  species production especially in AD astrocytes. While healthy astrocytes increase glutathione (GSH) release to protect the cells, Presenilin-1-mutated AD patient astrocytes do not. Thus, chronic inflammation is likely to induce oxidative damage in AD astrocytes. Activation of NRF2, the major regulator of cellular antioxidant defenses, encoded by the NFE2L2 gene, poses several beneficial effects on AD astrocytes. We report here that the activation of NRF2 pathway reduces amyloid secretion, normalizes cytokine release, and increases GSH secretion in AD astrocytes. NRF2 induction also activates the metabolism of astrocytes and increases the utilization of glycolysis. Taken together, targeting NRF2 in astrocytes could be a potent therapeutic strategy in AD.© 2019 The Authors.

The widespread occurrence and persistence of steroid hormones have attracted public attention due to their endocrine-disrupting effects on both wildlife and human beings. Bacteria are responsible for mineralizing steroids from the biosphere. Aerobic degradation of steroid hormones relies on O as a co-substrate of oxygenases to activate and to cleave the recalcitrant steroidal core ring. To date, two -dependent degradation pathways - the 9,10-seco pathway for androgens and the 4,5-seco pathways for oestrogens - have been characterized. Under anaerobic conditions, denitrifying bacteria adopt the ,3-seco pathway to degrade different steroid structures. Recent meta-omics revealed that microorganisms able to degrade steroids are highly diverse and ubiquitous in different ecosystems. This review also summarizes culture-independent approaches using the characteristic metabolites and catabolic genes to monitor steroid biodegradation in various ecosystems.© 2019 The Authors.

The plant treated -light and high-strength aqueous wastes and two different configurations were adopted: (1) thermophilic biological reactor + ultrafiltration (TAMR) and () TAMR + nanofiltration (TAMR + NF). In the latter case, the average chemical  demand removal yield was equal to 89% and an effective denitrification (nitrogen oxides removal equal to 96%) was achieved by reducing the dissolved  concentration in the bioreactor. Low specific sludge production was observed. Poor sludge settling properties were measured by a lab-scale settling test; respirometric tests (nitrogen uptake rate and ammonia uptake rate) showed the presence of denitrification and the inhibition of nitrification. Hydrodynamic tests revealed the presence of a significant dead space, thus showing room for improving the overall process performance.

In this study, normal-like developmental phenotype was observed in both cox17Δ6 and cox17Δ4 homozygous zebrafish mutants, while gene ontology term and pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes in both mutants showed enrichment in oxidoreductase activity, ion transport, histone methylation, MICOS complex, Wnt signaling, etc. This implied the occurrence of damage to the integral function of Cox17 and change of transcriptomes in the two mutants. Further qRT-PCR and WISH assays revealed the down-regulated expression of Wnt signaling and reduced expression of swim bladder marker genes in the two mutants. Moreover, copper stimulation induced no obvious increase in reactive  species (ROS) or in the expression of hemoglobin marker genes, but further reduced the expression of swim bladder marker genes in the mutants. The integral data in this study suggest that: (1) cox17 mutants cannot activate the response of oxidoreductase to copper stimulation; () copper depends on the integral function of Cox17 to induce developmental defects in hemoglobin rather than swim bladder and (3) Wnt signaling but not ROS might mediate copper-induced swim bladder developmental defects in fish.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Oxidized nucleotides such as '-deoxyribo-5-hydroxyuridin (HdU) and '-deoxyribo-5-hydroxymethyluridin (HMdU) can be inserted into DNA during replication and repair. HdU and HMdU have attracted particular interest because they have different effects on damaged-DNA processing enzymes that control the downstream effects of the lesions. Herein, we studied the chemically simulated translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) across the lesions formed by HdU or HMdU using microscale thermophoresis (MST). The thermodynamic changes associated with replication across HdU or HMdU show that the HdU paired with the mismatched deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates disturbs DNA duplexes considerably less than thymidine (dT) or HMdU. Moreover, we also demonstrate that TLS by DNA polymerases across the lesion derived from HdU was markedly less extensive and potentially more mutagenic than that across the lesion formed by HMdU. Thus, DNA polymerization by DNA polymerase η (polη), the exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (KF), and reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1 RT) across these pyrimidine lesions correlated with the different stabilization effects of the HdU and HMdU in DNA duplexes revealed by MST. The equilibrium thermodynamic data obtained by MST can explain the influence of the thermodynamic alterations on the ability of DNA polymerases to bypass lesions induced by oxidative products of pyrimidines. The results also highlighted the usefulness of MST in evaluating the impact of oxidative products of pyrimidines on the processing of these lesions by damaged DNA processing enzymes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677853>Coagulation of the lateral surface of aryepiglottic folds as an alternative to aryepiglottic fold release in management of type  laryngomalacia.</a></h2><p>Endoscopic supraglottoplasty is the procedure of choice in treatment of laryngomalacia with CO2 laser and cold steel being the most common instruments used with excellent results. However, bleeding, supraglottic stenosis and aspiration may occur leading to serious complications. Using coblation in management of laryngomalacia was found to be beneficial. Therefore, we conducted this study to evaluate the outcome of supraglottoplasty done by coagulation using coblation of the lateral surface of aryepiglottic folds as an alternative technique to aryepiglottic fold release in management of type  laryngomalacia.Retrospective study was conducted at Mansoura University Hospitals; Egypt from November 2017 to March 2018 included patients diagnosed with severe type  laryngomalacia. Supraglottoplasty was done by using coblator applied to the lateral surface of aryepiglottic folds allowing for lateral scarring thus widening the airway, preventing supraglottic collapse and avoiding re-stenosis. Outcome measures included assessment of presence or absence of the following symptoms preoperatively and postoperatively: inspiratory stridor, failure to thrive, choking and cyanosis. Preoperative and postoperative lowest  saturation levels, weight-by-age percentile, and need for tracheostomy were assessed.Nine patients were included in this study with a mean age of 3.78 ± 1.20 months (range -6 months). Overall success rate was 89%. The most significantly improved symptom was stridor (p-value 0.008). Significant improvement in lowest  saturation levels (from 89.11 ± 3.06% pre-operatively to 96.44 ± 3.50% post-operatively) and weight gain (from 4288.9 ± 643.1 gm. preoperatively to 5505.55 ± 1017.4 gm. 1 month postoperatively) was achieved. No detected re-stenosis on follow up and none of our cases needed tracheostomy.Supraglottoplasty by coagulation of the lateral surface of aryepiglottic folds using coblation is an effective and safe technique and can improve airway symptoms and weight gain in patients with type  laryngomalacia.Copyright © 2019.

Despite having attracted substantial attention, management of this environmental crisis remains challenging, partially due to limited monitoring to support model development and long-term assessments. Here, we leverage new geostatistical estimates of hypoxia derived from nearly 150 monitoring cruises and a process-based model to improve characterization of controlling mechanisms, historic trends, and future responses of hypoxia while rigorously quantifying uncertainty in a Bayesian framework. We find that November-March nitrogen loads are important controls of sediment  demand, which appears to be the major  sink. In comparison, only ~23% of  in the near-bottom region appears to be consumed by net water column respiration, which is driven by spring and summer loads. Hypoxia typically exceeds 15600 km in June, peaks in July, and declines below 10000 km in September. In contrast to some previous Gulf hindcasting studies, our simulations demonstrate that hypoxia was both severe and worsening prior to 1985, and has remained relatively stable since that time. Scenario analysis shows that halving nutrient loadings will reduce hypoxia by 37% w.r.t. 13900 km (1985-2016 median), while a +°C change in water temperature will cause a 26% hypoxic area increase due to enhanced sediment respiration and reduced  solubility. These new results highlight the challenges of achieving hypoxia reduction targets, particularly under warming conditions, and should be considered in ecosystem management.© 2019 by the Ecological Society of America.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677462>Co anchored on surface-functionalized PET non-woven fabric and used as high efficiency monoatom-like catalyst for activating Oxone in water.</a></h2><p>Fenton-like processes have emerged as most promising techniques for generating reactive -containing radicals to deal with increasing levels of environmental pollution. Developing novel catalysts with simple manufacturing requirements, excellent activity levels, and stability remains a long-term goal in terms of practical application. So herein, a new polyethylene terephthalate (PET) non-woven fabric based composite catalyst has been fabricated, using radiation-induced graft polymerization of a functionalized group to chelate Co ions as heterogeneous catalysts in peroxymonosulfate (Oxone) activation. Several impact factors, including catalyst dosage, Oxone concentration, reaction temperature, pH value, Co precipitation ratio (of Co@PET at different pH values), and highly concentrated NaCl have been investigated here. Notably, Co@PET has shown the lowest activation energy of any reported catalyst, for degrading RhB by activating Oxone. Interestingly, as experimental RhB and Oxone solutions were passed through single Co@PET sheets, the RhB was decomposed into a colorless solution in the penetration process. Based on radical trapping and quenching experiments, a channel was determined to dominate RhB degradation, and furthermore, Co@PET could be re-used for RhB degradation by activating Oxone. These results showed that Co@PET effectively provided improved Fenton-like catalytic performance and stability, and was suitable for practical applications.Copyright © 2019.

In order to fully exert the potential of PA imaging in biomedical applications, new contrast agents with improved PA stability and efficiency are highly demanded. Herein, we present a new PA agent based on -embedded quinoidal nonacene chromophore that is self-assembled into nanoparticle (Nano(O-Nonacene)-PEG), assisted by polyethylene glycol (PEG). Notably, the photothermal conversion efficiency of Nano(O-Nonacene)-PEG is 1.5 folds that of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (Nano(PCPDTBT)-PEG), and .8 folds that of Au nanorods, owing to the low quantum yield of Nano(O-Nonacene)-PEG. And thereby, Nano(O-Nonacene)-PEG possess the greatly elevated PA signal intensity, compared to Nano(PCPDTBT)-PEG and Au nanorods, which have been widely explored for PA imaging. Due to the high resistance to photo bleaching, Nano(O-Nonacene)-PEG exhibits higher PA signal stability, which may be employed for long-term PA imaging. Moreover, when magnetic Zn0.4Fe2.6O4 nanoparticles are incorporated into Nano(O-Nonacene)-PEG, not only magnetic resonance signals are generated, but also the photoacoustic efficacy is greatly enhanced. Therefore, Nano(O-Nonacene)-PEG offer distinct properties: (i) The elevated photoacoustic effect allows for high-resolution photoacoustic imaging; (ii) Small size (10 nm in diameter) results in efficient tumor-targeting; (iii) The facile application of efficient photothermal therapy in vivo.

Two soils with different carbon organic (C) content were studied: a soil from Togo (C = 0.3% in top horizon) and a soil from France (C = 4.% in top horizon). HPO* and TPH* fractions were characterized by combining elemental analysis, determination of specific ultra-violet absorbance (SUVA) index and distribution of apparent molecular weight (AMW). Comparison to natural organic matter (NOM) fractions from surface water confirmed high similarities in composition except a lower  percentage explained by the different genesis processes. HPO* and TPH* adsorption tests were conducted under batch experiments on each horizon of both soils to evaluate the impact of OM fractions on the physico-chemical characteristics of soils, to determine the carbon adsorption and to calculate their adsorption capacity. Whatever the soil, C adsorption did not correlate with clay content but rather with initial C content in the horizon. HPO* fraction was better adsorbed than TPH* fraction. Besides, while C adsorption percentages on each horizon of soils were higher for French soil, the adsorption capacities, explained as the ratio of organic carbon mass adsorbed on soils on its initial carbon mass, were  to 10 times higher for soil from Togo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In awake animals, exploiting intrinsic signal optical imaging, Doppler optical coherence tomography, and two-photon microscopy, we investigate how the progression of atherosclerotic disease affects the morphology and function of cortical microvasculature as well as baseline cerebral tissue oxygenation. Results show that aged ATX mice exhibited weaker hemodynamic response in the somatosensory cortex to whisker stimulation and that the diameter of their descending arterioles and associated mean blood flow decreased significantly compared with the young ATX group. Data from two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy indicate that old ATX mice had lower and more heterogeneous partial pressure of  (  ) in cortical tissue than young ATX mice. In addition, hypoxic micropockets in cortical tissue were found in old, but not young, ATX mice. Capillary red blood cell (RBC) flux, RBC velocity, RBC velocity heterogeneity, hematocrit, and diameter were also measured using line scans with two-photon fluorescence microscopy. When compared with the young group, RBC flux, velocity, and hematocrit decreased and RBC velocity heterogeneity increased in old ATX mice, presumably due to disturbed blood supply from arterioles that were affected by atherosclerosis. Finally, dilation of capillaries in old ATX mice was observed, which suggests that capillaries play an active role in compensating for an  deficit in brain tissue.© The Authors.

However, the beneficial effects of CP are limited by the toxic effects, especially nephrotoxicity. Fluorofenidone (AKFPD) is a promising multifunctional antifibrosis pyridinone drug discovered by our group. But there is no evidence of its protective effects against acute kidney injury (AKI). Therefore, we investigated the protective effects of AKFPD on CP-induced AKI  and . Compared with the model group, treatment with AKFPD effectively ameliorated kidney damages. In order to elucidate the mechanisms, we discovered that AKFPD treatment notably alleviated generation of reactive  species, reduced the phosphorylation levels of MAPKs (ERK1 and , JNKs, and p38), suppressed inflammatory response, inhibited apoptosis, and abated the expression of CP transporters (organic cation transporter  and copper transport protein 1) compared with the model group. Moreover, because renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI)-induced AKI and LPS-induced AKI are the major models representative of renal transplantation-correlated AKI and sepsis-related AKI, which are also the main causes of AKI, we have also proved the effectiveness of AKFPD on these models. In conclusion, these findings suggest that AKFPD is a potent drug for CP-, IRI-, and LPS-caused AKI and elucidate the underlying mechanism.-Jiang, Y., Quan, J., Chen, Y., Liao, X., Dai, Q., Lu, R., Yu, Y., Hu, G., Li, Q., Meng, J., Xie, Y., Peng, Z., Tao, L.

We compared blood transfusions, incidence of primary graft dysfunction (PGD), duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS and survival of ECMO and non-ECMO patients. Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, and log-rank tests were used.Twenty-eight (40%) of the 70 included patients needed intraoperative central veno-arterial ECMO with postoperative veno-venous prolongation in 6 subjects. Lower right ventricle ejection fraction (p = 0.013, OR 0.92(0.86-0.98)), higher  requirement (p = 0.026, OR 1.39(1.01-1.90)), lower body surface area (p = 0.044, OR 0.05(0.00-1.03)), and CF-related diabetes (p = 0.044, OR .81(1.03-7.66)) were associated with intraoperative ECMO. Compared to non-ECMO patients, ECMO patients needed almost fivefold intraoperative transfusion (2227 mL vs. 570 mL, p<0.001) and had PGD grade > 0 at 72 h more frequently (16/57% vs. 12/28%, p = 0.017, OR 3.33(1.22-9.09)). Mechanical ventilation, ICU LOS and hospital LOS were significantly longer in ECMO patients. Survival at follow-up (651(326-1277) days) of ECMO and non-ECMO patients was 78% vs. 83%, respectively (OR 0.73 (0.21-.46), p = 0.616, log-rank test p = 0.498).Pre-operative risk assessment and clinical planning should be done according to the predictors above. While undeniably useful as a life-saving procedure, ECMO during LUTX for CF is associated with worsened short-term outcomes. ECMO should be implemented weighing its risk and benefits.Copyright © 2019.

The utility of endostatin as a risk marker for mortality in the emergency department (ED) has not been reported.Our main aim was to study the association between plasma endostatin and 90-day mortality in an unselected cohort of patients admitted to the ED for acute dyspnea. Design Circulating endostatin was analyzed in plasma from 1710 adults and related to 90-day mortality in Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index,  saturation, respiratory rate, body temperature, C-reactive protein, lactate, creatinine and medical priority according to the Medical Emergency Triage and Treatment System-Adult score (METTS-A). The predictive value of endostatin for mortality was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and compared with the clinical triage scoring system and age.Each one standard deviation increment of endostatin was associated with a HR of .12 (95 % CI 1.31-3.44 p< 0.01) for 90-day mortality after full adjustment. Levels of endostatin were significantly increased in the group of patients with highest METTS-A (p<0.001). When tested for the outcome 90-day mortality, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.616 for METTS-A, 0.701 for endostatin, 0.708 for METTS -A and age and 0.738 for METTS-A, age and levels of endostatin.In an unselected cohort of patients admitted to the ED with acute dyspnea, endostatin had a string association to 90-day mortality and improved prediction of 90-day mortality in the ED beyond the clinical triage scoring system and age with 3 %.Copyright © 2019.

ROS are chemically similar to reactive sulfur species (RSS) and signal through identical mechanisms. Here we examined the effects of LA on RSS in HEK293 cells using HS and polysulfide (PS) specific fluorophores, AzMC and SSP4. We show that LA concentration-dependently increased both HS and PS. Physioxia (5% O) augmented the effects of LA on HS production but decreased PS production. Thiosulfate, a known substrate for reduced LA, and an intermediate in the catabolism of HS enhanced the effects of LA on HS and PS production. Inhibiting peroxiredoxins with conoidin A and gluraredoxins with tiopronin augmented the effects of LA on PS and HS, respectively while decreasing glutathione with buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) or diethyl maleate (DEM) decreased the stimulatory effect of LA on HS production but augmented LA's effect on PS. Aminooxyacetate (AOA) and propargylglycine (PPG), inhibitors of HS production from cysteine partially inhibited LA augmentation of HS production and further decreased the LA effect when applied concurrently with BSO and DEM. The selective and cell-permeable HS scavenger, SS20, inhibited the effects of LA on cellular HS. Estimates of single-cell HS production suggest that 0.1-0.% of O consumption is used to metabolize HS and these requirements may increase to 1-% with 1 mM LA. Collectively, these results suggest that LA rescues HS from irreversible oxidation and that the effects of LA on RSS directly confer antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective responses. They also suggest that TS may be an effective supplement to increase the efficacy of LA in clinical settings.Copyright © 2019.

Here, the role of chemical composition, architecture, and fixation on the ecotoxicological effects on microalgae of different ZnO and ZnO@ZnS based water decontamination photocatalysts was analyzed in depth. In particular, the ecotoxicological effects of films, nanoparticles and biomimetic micro/nano-ferns were carefully assessed by correlating the algae's viability to the Zn(II) release, the photocatalyst-microalgae interaction, and the production of reactive  species (ROS). The results showed a drastic improvement in algal viability for supported ZnO@ZnS core@shell micro/nanoferns, as their ecotoxicity after 96 h light exposure was significantly lower (3.7-10.0% viability loss) compared to the ZnO films (18.4-35.5% loss), ZnO micro/nanoferns (28.5-53.5% loss), ZnO nanoparticles (48.3-91.7% loss) or ZnO@ZnS nanoparticles (8.6-19.% loss) for catalysts concentrations ranging from 25 mg L to 400 mg L. In particular, the ZnO@ZnS micro/nanoferns with a concentration of 400 mg L exhibited excellent photocatalytic efficiency to mineralize a multi-pollutant solution (81.4 ± 0.3% mineralization efficiency after 210 min under UV-filtered visible light irradiation) and minimal photocorrosion (<5% of photocatalyst dissolution after 96 h of UV-filtered visible light irradiation). Remarkably, the ZnO@ZnS micro/nanoferns showed lower loss of algal viability (9.8 ± 1.1%) after 96 h of light exposure, with minimal reduction in microalgal biomass (9.1 ± 1.0%), as well as in the quantity of chlorophyll-a (9.5 ± 1.0%), carotenoids (8.6 ± 0.9%) and phycocyanin (5.6 ± 0.6%). Altogether, the optimized ZnO@ZnS core@shell micro/nanoferns represent excellent ecofriendly photocatalysts for water remediation in complex media, as they combine enhanced sunlight remediation efficiency, minimal adverse effects on biological microorganisms, high reusability and easy recyclability.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, mixed signals of anoxia and oxygenation in the sulfur isotope record between .5 to .3 billion years (Ga) ago require independent clarification, for example via  isotopes in sulfate. Here we show <.31 Ga sedimentary barium sulfates (barites) from the Turee Creek Basin, W. Australia with positive sulfur isotope anomalies of ∆S up to + 1.55‰ and low δO down to -19.5‰. The unequivocal origin of this combination of signals is sulfide oxidation in meteoric water. Geochemical and sedimentary evidence suggests that these S-isotope anomalies were transferred from the paleo-continent under an oxygenated atmosphere.

Carbamazepine (CBZ), widely used as an antiepileptic agent, could cause rare but severe idiosyncratic liver injury in humans. Although recent studies have shown that inflammasome is implicated in CBZ-induced hepatocellular injury in vitro, the precise pathogenesis of hepatotoxicity remains largely unexplored. Here we report that CBZ causes idiosyncratic liver injury through promoting specific stimuli-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. CBZ (40 μM) enhances NLRP3 inflammasome activation triggered by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or nigericin, rather than SiO, monosodium urate crystal or intracellular lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In addition, CBZ has no effect on NLRC4 or AIM2 inflammasome activation. Mechanistically, synergistic induction of mitochondrial reactive  species (mtROS) is a crucial event in the enhancement effect of CBZ on ATP- or nigericin-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Moreover, the "C=C" on the seven-membered ring and "C=O" on the nitrogen of CBZ may be contribute to NLRP3 inflammasome hyperactivation and hepatotoxicity. Notably, in vivo data indicate that CBZ (50 mg/kg) causes liver injury in an LPS ( mg/kg)-mediated susceptibility mouse model of IDILI, accompanied by an increase in caspase-1 activity and IL-1β production, whereas the combination of CBZ and LPS does not exhibit the effect in NLRP3-knockout mice. In conclusion, CBZ specifically promotes ATP- or nigericin-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and causes idiosyncratic liver injury. Our findings also suggest that CBZ may be avoided in patients with NLRP3 inflammasome activation-related diseases that are triggered by ATP or nigericin, which may be risk factors for IDILI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669661>Betula utilis extract prolongs life expectancy, protects against amyloid-β toxicity and reduces Alpha Synuclien in Caenorhabditis elegans via DAF-16 and SKN-1.</a></h2><p>Betula utilis (BU), an important medicinal plant that grows in high altitudes of the Himalayan region, has been utilized traditionally due to it's antibacterial, hepatoprotective, and anti-tumor properties. Here, we demonstrated the longevity and amyloid-β toxicity attenuating activity of B. utilis ethanolic extract (BUE) in Caenorhabditis elegans. Lifespan of the worms was observed under both the standard laboratory and stress (oxidative and thermal) conditions. Effect of BUE was also observed on the attenuation of age-dependent physiological parameters. Further, gene-specific mutants and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged strains were used to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the beneficial effects mediated by BUE supplementation. Our results showed that BUE (50 μg/ml) extended the mean lifespan of C. elegans by 35.99% and increased its survival under stress conditions. The BUE also reduced the levels of intracellular reactive  species (ROS) by 22.47%. A delayed amyloid-β induced paralyses was observed in CL4176 transgenic worms. Interestingly, the BUE supplementation was also able to reduce the α-synuclein aggregation in NL5901 transgenic strain. Gene-specific mutant studies suggested that the BUE-mediated lifespan extension was dependent on daf-16, hsf-1, and skn-1 but not on sir-.1 gene. Furthermore, transgenic reporter gene expression assay showed that BUE treatment enhanced the expression of stress-protective genes such as sod-3 and gst-4. Present findings suggested that ROS scavenging activity, together with multiple longevity mechanisms, were involved in BUE-mediated lifespan extension. Thus, BUE might have potential to increase the lifespan and to attenuate neuro-related disease progression.Copyright © 2019.

Exposure to DEHP impairs the function of islet beta cells (INS-1 cells), which is related to insulin resistance and type  diabetes. At present, some research data have also confirmed that MEHP has a certain damage effect on INS-1 cells. In our experiment, we found that MEHP would lead to the increase of reactive  species (ROS) and the upregulation of autophagy. And downregulated ROS production by -acetyl-l-cysteine could also reduce autophagy. In addition, MEHP-induced lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) subsequently released cathepsin D. Additionally, MEHP induced the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and release of cytochrome . Addition of autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine relieved MEHP-induced apoptosis as assessed by the expression of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 9, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, indicating that MEHP-induced apoptosis was autophagy dependent. Cathepsin D inhibitor, pepstatin A, suppressed MEHP-induced mitochondria release of cytochrome  and apoptosis as well. Meanwhile, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a new B vitamin, improved the above phenomenon. Taken together, our results indicate that MEHP induces autophagy-dependent apoptosis in INS-1 cells by lysosomal-mitochondrial axis. PQQ improved this process by downregulating ROS and provided a degree of protection. Our study provides a new perspective for MEHP on the cytotoxic mechanism and PQQ protection in INS-1 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670678>A Real-Time Vital-Sign Monitoring in the Physical Domain on a Mixed-Signal Reconfigurable Platform.</a></h2><p>This work presents a mixed-signal physical-computation-electronics for monitoring three vital signs; namely heart rate, blood pressure, and blood  saturation; from electrocardiography, arterial blood pressure, and photoplethysmography signals in real-time.

To avoid restrictions imposed when using a high-volume active sampler, this study uses tree leaves to act as passive samplers to investigate the spatial distribution characteristics and sources of airborne EPFRs. Tree leaf samples were collected from 120 sites in five areas around China (each approximately 4 km × 4 km). EPFR concentrations in particles (< μm) on the surface of 110 leaf samples were detected, ranging from 7.5 × 10 to 4.5 × 10 spins/g. For the 10 N.D. samples, they were all collected from areas inaccessible by vehicles. The g-values of EPFRs on 68% leaf samples were larger than .004, suggesting the electron localized on the  atom, and they were consistent with the road dust sample (g-value: .0042). Significant positive correlation was found between concentrations of elemental carbon (tracer of vehicle emissions) and EPFRs. Spatial distribution mapping showed that EPFR levels in various land uses differed noticeably. Although previous work has linked atmospheric EPFRs to waste incineration, the evidence in this study suggests that vehicle emissions, especially from heavy-duty vehicles, are the main sources. While waste incinerators with low emissions or effective dust-control devices might not be an important EPFR contributor. According to our estimation, over 90% of the EPFRs deposited on tree leaves might be attributed to automotive exhaust emissions, as a synergistic effect of primary exhausts and degradation of aromatic compounds in road dust. With adding the trapping agent into the particle samples (< μm), signals of hydroxyl radicals were observed. This indicates that EPFRs collected from this phytosampling method can lead to the release of reactive  species (ROS) once they are inhaled by human beings. Thus, this study helps highlight EPFR "hotspots" for potential health risk identification.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Primary studies have shown that single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the selenoprotein gene () are associated with cancer risk. However, conflicting outcomes warrant a meta-analysis to obtain more precise estimates. Literature search yielded 18 case-control studies from 12 articles. We calculated pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of two  polymorphisms (rs5845 and rs5859) using standard genetic models (homozygous, recessive, dominant and codominant). Subgroup analysis was based on statistical power (80% cutoff) and cancer type (breast/respiratory/genitourinary/colorectal). Heterogeneity of the outcomes necessitated examining their sources (outlier treatment). Multiple comparison outcomes were corrected with the False Discovery Rate (). Our core findings lay in the post-outlier recessive subgroup outcomes, where risks in the powered study (≥ 80%) was increased (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.02-1.57,  = 0.047) while that in genitourinary cancer was protective (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.20-0.43,  < 10).

All the patients who underwent polysomnography were analyzed for the presence of OHS. Of 85 patients referred for polysomnography, 76 had SDB. Thirteen patients were excluded because of hypoventilation due to other known causes or could not perform spirometry.The prevalence of OHS among SDB after excluding the other causes of hypoventilation was 15.87% (10/63). The predictors were determined using univariate analysis between daytime partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO) and other predictors. PaCO significantly correlated with minimum nocturnal  saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO), FVC %predicted, BMI, daytime SpO, forced expiratory volume %predicted, and partial pressure of  (PaO).

Cardiac dimensions were assessed by echocardiographic examination at rest. Peak  uptake was obtained by a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill.Circulating levels of analysed hormones at rest did not differ between the groups. A correlation was found between increased cardiac dimensions and IGF-1 in the controls, but not in the active group. This correlation declined also among the controls when the cardiac parameters were indexed for body surface area.Increased cardiac dimensions in endurance-trained adolescents could not be related to resting levels of hormones associated with growth and metabolism, including IGF-1 and GH. In addition, the resting levels of these hormones seem not to be affected by intense regular endurance exercise in adolescents. These findings may contribute to the knowledge about cellular signaling that trigger growth as well as cardiac adaptation to endurance training in young athletes.Copyright © 2019 Louise Rundqvist et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666806>Process development for pandemic influenza VLP vaccine production using a baculovirus expression system.</a></h2><p>Influenza viruses cause hundreds of thousands of respiratory diseases worldwide each year, and vaccination is considered the most effective approach for preventing influenza annual epidemics or pandemics. Since 1950, chicken embryonated eggs have been used as the main method for producing seasonal influenza vaccines. However, this platform has the main drawback of a lack of scale-up flexibility, and thus, egg-based vaccine manufacturers cannot supply sufficient doses within a short period for use for pandemic prevention. As a result, strategies for reducing the manufacturing time and increasing production capacity are urgently needed. Non-virion vaccine methods have been considered an alternative strategy against an influenza pandemic, and the purpose of maintaining an immunogenic capsule structure with infectious properties appears to be met by the virus-like particle (VLP) platform.An influenza H7N9-TW VLP production platform using insect cells, which included the expression of hemagglutinin (HA), NA, and M1 proteins, was established. To scale up H7N9-TW VLP production, several culture conditions were optimized to obtain a higher production yield. A high level of dissolved  could be critical to H7N9-TW VLP production. If the DO was maintained at a high level, the HA titer obtained in the spinner flask system with ventilation was similar to that obtained in a shake flask. In this study, the HA titer in a 5-L bioreactor with a well-controlled DO level was substantially improved by 128-fold (from 4 HA units (HAU)/50 μL to 512 HAU/50 μL).In this study, a multigene expression platform and an effective upstream process were developed. Notably, a high H7N9-TW VLP yield was achieved using a two-step production strategy while a high DO level was maintained. The upstream process, which resulted in high VLP titers, could be further used for large-scale influenza VLP vaccine production.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657417>Electronic modulation of composite electrocatalysts derived from layered NiFeMn triple hydroxide nanosheets for boosted overall water splitting.</a></h2><p>Herein, we report the synthesis of Fe and Mn co-doped Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays (FM-NS NSAs) as well as layered NiFeMn triple hydroxide (NiFeMn-LTH)/FM-NS hybrid NSAs (HNSAs) via an easily controllable sulfidation method with NiFeMn-LTH NSAs as the precursor, which can be employed as coupled  evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrodes to achieve boosted overall water splitting performance. It is discovered that the incorporation of the dual Fe and Mn cations can simultaneously modulate the morphology and optimize the electron density of the obtained catalysts. As a result, the full sulfidation product of FM-NS NSAs display a much-enhanced activity for the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm- with an overpotential of 188 mV. The NiFeMn-LTH/FM-NS HNSAs obtained from partial sulfidation demonstrate an enhanced HER activity with a lower overpotential of 110 mV at 10 mA cm-. The FM-NS NSA anode and the NiFeMn-LTH/FM-NS HNSA cathode were coupled in an alkaline medium for overall water splitting and exhibited a much lower cell voltage of 1.48 V at 10 mA cm-, superior to most of the reported noble-metal-free electrocatalysts.

Recent observational research has suggested a relationship between RBC death (eryptosis) and hypoxemia in hemodialysis patients. Thus, we studied the isolated and joint effects of a uremic toxin (indoxyl sulfate; IS) and hypoxia on RBC biology.We incubated RBC from healthy donors with IS at concentrations of 0.01mM, 0.09mM and 0.17mM under both normoxic (21% O) and hypoxic (5% O) conditions for 24 hours. Eryptosis was evaluated by RBC phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, cell volume, and cytosolic calcium which were quantified by Annexin-V+, forward scatter, and Fluo-3AM+ binding, respectively. RBC redox balance was reported by reactive  species (ROS) production and intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH). Analyses were performed by flow cytometry.Hypoxia induced a -fold ROS production compared to normoxia. PS exposure and cytosolic calcium increased, while cell volume decreased by hypoxia and likewise by IS. IS increased ROS production in a dose-dependent manner under conditions of both normoxia and hypoxia. The same conditions promoted a GSH decrease with IS intensifying the hypoxia-induced effects.In summary, our results indicate that the concurrent presence of hypoxia and uremia augments RBC death and may therefore, contribute to the genesis of anemia in CKD.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Herein, we develop a simple yet robust acid-treatment strategy to judiciously create an amorphous TiO  buffer layer intimately situated on the anatase TiO  surface as electron transport layer (ETL) for efficient electron transport. The facile acid treatment is capable of weakening the bonding of zigzag octahedral chains in anatase TiO  , thereby shortening staggered octahedron chains to form an amorphous buffer layer on the anatase TiO  surface. Such amorphous TiO  -coated ETL possesses an increased electron density due to the presence of  vacancies, leading to efficient electron transfer from perovskite to TiO  . Compared to pristine TiO  -based devices, the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with acid-treated TiO  ETL exhibit enhanced short circuit current and power conversion efficiency. These findings demonstrate an unconventional route to crafting effective ETLs by deliberately creating an intimate, tailored amorphous semiconductor buffer layer for high-performance PSCs.

In the presence of 0.4 g/g TSS APG, the concentrations of soluble chemical  demand (SCOD), soluble carbohydrate and soluble protein in dissolved organic matters (DOM) were 0.4, .4 and 1.3 times of that without APG addition, respectively. Excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the addition of APG led to the increase of soluble microbial materials and the decrease of fulvic acid-like substances in DOM, which was beneficial for the subsequent process of anaerobic digestion. Using APG promoted the releasing of enzymes trapped in saline waste sludge and improved the activity of enzymes during hydrolysis. The activities of α-glucosidase and protease increased by 8.8% and 21.3% respectively in the presence of 0.4 g/g TSS APG comparing no APG addition.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Resveratrol triggers signaling dependent on the protein kinase activated by adenosine monophosphate (AMPK), the sensor of cellular energy metabolism that regulates autophagy, eliminates damaged mitochondria, and increases energy sources. In the present study, we investigated the participation of AMPK activation in the protective effect of resveratrol on cerebral ischemia and excitotoxicity. We found that resveratrol increased the levels of phosphorylated AMPK in the cerebral cortex of rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and in primary cultured neurons exposed to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Resveratrol (1.8 mg/Kg; i. v.; administered at the beginning of reperfusion) decreased the infarct area and increased survival of rats subjected to MCAO. In neuronal cultures, resveratrol treatment (40 μM, after excitotoxicity) reduced the production of superoxide anion, prevented the overload of intracellular Ca associated to mitochondrial failure, reduced the release of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, and reduced death. It also promoted mitophagy (increased Beclin 1 level, favored the recruitment of LC3-II, reduced LAMP1, and reduced mitochondrial matrix protein HSP60 levels). In both models, inhibition of AMPK activation with Compound C obstructed the effect of resveratrol, showing that its protective effect depends, partially, on the activation of the AMPK/autophagy pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675477>Breaking the local symmetry of LiCoO2 via atomic doping for efficient  evolution.</a></h2><p>The obstacle for efficient electrochemical water splitting lies in the kinetically sluggish  evolution reaction. Despite the various efforts that have been made to understand and tune the active sites for  evolution reaction, an insight into the configurations of active sites from the electronic perspective is still lacking. Here, we report an atomic doping strategy to break the Oh symmetry of CoO6 octahedron in LiCoO2. The specific activity of the La-doped LiCoO2 was 3.14 mA cm- at the overpotential of 0.35 V, which was 8.3 times higher than that of pristine LiCoO2. The overpotential with a value of 330 mV at 10 mA cm- was the lowest among the LiCoO2-based OER electrocatalysts ever reported. Mechanistic studies revealed that the superior activity originated from the asymmetric octahedral coordination of Co, resulting in the enhanced electronic conductivity and Co-O hybridization for the accelerated  evolution kinetics.

Our multi-proxy study of a marine sediment core collected about 60 km southwest of the Outer Hellefisk Moraines demonstrates that in the southern Davis Strait region the most extreme Greenland shelf glaciation of the last glacial cycle occurred during MIS 4, with another prominent glacial advance at 37-33 kyr BP. During those periods the GIS likely reached the Outer Hellefisk Moraines in this area. Except for these two periods, our data suggest significant advection of relatively warm Irminger Sea Water by the West Greenland Current since MIS 4. This advection likely limited the extent of the MIS2 glaciation on the SW Greenland shelf. Decreased precipitation over southwestern Greenland predicted by atmospheric models as a downstream effect of a much larger MIS2 Laurentide Ice Sheet may have played an additional role.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663349>Neural stem cells neuroprotection by simvastatin via autophagy induction and apoptosis inhibition.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to investigate the effects of Simvastatin (SIM), a member of statin family, on the cellular antioxidant system, autophagy and apoptosis in NSCs exposed to hydrogen peroxide.Reduction in cellular oxidative stress increases the survival of neural stem cells (NSCs) after transplantation into the damaged area of the affected central nervous system.NSCs derived from bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were exposed to H2O2 (100 μM) for 48 hours after pretreatment with SIM ( μM).

He failed an initial trial of non-invasive ventilation and was planned for intubation and mechanical ventilation. However, the patient suffered a pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest peri-intubation. He was started on our institution's protocolized post-cardiac arrest care bundle, which included cerebral regional  saturation (rSO) monitoring and TTM. Initial arterial blood gas (ABG) post-return of spontaneous circulation showed severe respiratory acidosis, and the patient was sedated, paralyzed, and ventilator settings optimized. Repeat ABG showed resolution of respiratory acidosis. However, a drop in rSO to 35% was subsequently noted. Ventilator settings were quickly adjusted, and dobutamine was started to improve global and cerebral perfusion. These measures improved cerebral rSO to more than 50%. Patient was cooled for 24 h and gradually rewarmed. He was later extubated with a cerebral performance category of 1 and is now on outpatient follow-up.During post-cardiac arrest care, there are many factors which can contribute to a decrease in cerebral blood flow. Therapeutic hypothermia and ventilation strategies, including the use of neuromuscular blocking agents, can both reduce pCO which is a major regulator of cerebrovascular tone. Accidental hypocapnia can lead to adverse cerebral vasoconstriction and hypoperfusion. Without cerebral oximetry, cerebral ischaemia may not be detected early and can potentially result in secondary brain injury.© The Author(s) 2019.

Herein, a Co(ii) ion-driven self-assembly strategy is described for the synthesis of cobalt-based nanostructured transition metal compounds (Co-NTMCs) embedded in nitrogen and sulfur codoped hierarchical porous carbon submicrospheres (Co-NTMCs@NSC), where condensation of thiourea-ethylenediamine-formaldehyde resin (TEFR) is induced by Co(ii) ions which is simultaneously assembled with polydopamine to form a multifunctional precursor through coordinated interaction. The resulting Co-NTMCs@NSC sample comprises abundant hierarchical porous textures, a high content of active cobalt species including the nanoparticles of Co, Co3O4 and amorphous CoSx, and a considerable amount of defective structures. These characteristics lead to remarkable  electrocatalytic activities, with a half-wave potential of +0.833 V vs. RHE, which is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C for the  reduction reaction (ORR), and a lower overpotential of 284 mV than RuO2 at 10 mA·cm- for the  evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Furthermore, its operational stability is also much higher than that of commercial RuO2 and Pt/C catalysts. When used as a breathing air electrode for Zn-air batteries, Co-NTMCs@NSC shows a higher open-circuit voltage (1.509 V), higher discharge power density (262 mW cm-) and better charge-discharge reversibility than commercial Pt/C.

In this study, the feasibility and safety of papermaking wastewater for the use as ecological water supplement after the treatment by fluidized-bed Fenton (FBF) coupled with constructed wetland (CW), were investigated from laboratory-scale to large-scale field. The optimum pH, HO, HO/Fe ratio and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of FBF were 3.5, 0.93 mL/L, 4 and 60 min, respectively, based on reduction of both total organic carbon (TOC) and genotoxicity. Furthermore, the safety of effluent was evaluated using SOS/umu assay and 8-hydroxy--deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in zebrafish. Results showed FBF followed by CW improved the conventional water quality indicators and reduced the toxicity. Average removal rates of chemical  demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH-N), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and colority were 87.3%, 93.59%, 51.73%, 84.75% and 95.86%, respectively. The equivalent concentration of 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO-EQ) decreased from 30.6 ± 1.6 μg/L in influent to 12.4 ± 1.0 μg/L after treated by FBF, then decreased to 5.9 ± 0.4 μg/L after treated by CW and to 3. ± 0.3 μg/L after 12-km downstream self-purification. The chronic survival rates of 21-d zebrafish significantly increased from 0.0% in influent to 58.8 ± 4.0% in effluent of CW and gradually increased to 68.8 ± .6% after 12-km downstream self-purification. Similarly, 8-OHdG level in zebrafish decreased from 120.0 ± 19.3 ng/L in effluent of ecological oxidation pond to 94.0 ± 7.5 ng/L in effluent of CW and gradually decreased to 42.0 ± 3.0 ng/L after 12-km downstream self-purification.

We used the lung cancer cell line, A549, to determine the effects of the curcuminoids and cisplatin on cell viability and several apoptotic signaling mechanisms. Cellular viability was measured using the MTT assay. A scratch assay was used to measure cell migration and fluorescent spectrophotometry to measure reactive  species (ROS) production. Western blots and luminescence assays were used to measure the expression and activity of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), caspases-3/7, -8, -9, and -12, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase (Src). A zebrafish model was used to evaluate auditory effects. Cisplatin, the curcuminoids, and their combinations had similar effects on cell viability (IC values: -16 μM) and AIF, caspase-12, JNK, MAPK, and Src expression, while caspase-3/7, -8, and -9 activity was unchanged or decreased. Cisplatin increased ROS yield (1.-fold), and curcuminoid and combination treatments reduced ROS (0.75-0.85-fold). Combination treatments reduced A549 migration (0.51-0.53-fold). Both curcuminoids reduced auditory threshold shifts induced by cisplatin. In summary, cisplatin and the curcuminoids might cause cell death through AIF and caspase-12. The curcuminoids may potentiate cisplatin's effect against A549 migration, but may counteract cisplatin's effect to increase ROS production. The curcuminoids might also prevent cisplatin ototoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658450>The production of positron emitters with millisecond half-life during helium beam radiotherapy.</a></h2><p>Therapy with helium ions is currently receiving significantly increasing interest because helium ions have a sharper penumbra than protons and undergo less fragmentation than carbon ions and thus require less complicated dose calculations. For any ion of interest in hadron therapy, the accuracy of dose delivery is limited by range uncertainties. This has led to efforts by several groups to develop in-vivo verification techniques, including Positron Emission Tomography (PET), for monitoring of the dose delivery. Beam-on PET monitoring during proton therapy through the detection of short-lived positron emitters such as 12N (T1/ = 11 ms), an emerging PET technique, provides an attractive option given the achievable range accuracy, minimal susceptibility to biological washout and provision of near prompt feedback. Extension of this approach to helium ions requires information on the production yield of relevant short-lived positron emitters. This study presents the first measurements of the production of short-lived positron emitters in water, graphite, calcium and phosphorus targets irradiated with 59 MeV/u 3He and 50 MeV/u 4He beams. For these targets, the most produced short-lived nuclides are 13O/12N (T1/ = 8.6/11 ms) on water, 13O/12N on graphite, 43Ti/41Sc/42Sc (T1/ = 509 - 680 ms) on calcium, 28P (T1/ = 268 ms) on phosphorus. A translation of the results from elemental targets to PMMA and representative tissues such as adipose tissue, muscle, compact and cortical bone, shows the dominance of 13O/12N in at least the first 20 s of an irradiation with 4He and somewhat longer with 3He. As the production of 13O/12N in a 3He irradiation is 3 to 4 times higher than in a 4He irradiation, from a statistical point of view, range verification using 13O/12N PET imaging will be about  times more precise for a 3He irradiation compared to a 4He irradiation.© 2019 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679267>Antioxidant Enzymes Expression of the Impaired Contralateral Testes in Unilaterally Cryptorchid Rats.</a></h2><p>In this study, explored the pathologic mechanism of the contralateral testes impairment in unilaterally cryptorchid rats by investigating the gene expression level.Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly and evenly divided into two groups: cryptorchid group and control group. Cryptorchidism was induced by surgical relocation. RT-PCR was then applied to examine the mRNA expression level of antioxidant enzymes in descended testes, including glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), and catalase (CAT). The concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) was determined by spectrophotometry. In addition, germ-cell apoptosis was detected by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay.Two weeks after the operation, the mRNA expression levels of GSH-PX and Cu/Zn-SOD in the cryptorchid group were significantly downregulated; the expression of MDA, as well as the number of apoptotic germ cells, significantly increased compared to the control group (p < 0.01). The mRNA expression of CAT did not show significant changes (p > 0.05).GSH-PX and SOD were downregulated in the testis contralateral to the undescended testis, leading to the accumulation of reactive  species and germ-cell apoptosis.

It is typically synthesized by indirect batch anthraquinone process, where sequential hydrogenation and oxidation of anthraquinone molecules generates HO. This highly energy demanding catalytic sequence necessitates the advent of new reaction pathways with lower energy expenditure. Here we demonstrate a Zn-quinone battery for paired HO electrosynthesis at the three phase boundary of its cathodic half-cell during electric power generation. The catalytic quinone half-cell of the Zn-quinone battery, mediates proton coupled electron transfer with molecular  during its chemical regeneration thereby pairing peroxide electrosynthesis with electricity generation. Hydrogen peroxide synthesizing Zn-quinone battery (HPSB) demonstrated a peak power density of ~90 mW/cm at a peak current density of ~145 mA/cm while synthesizing ~230 mM of HO.

The roles of these ligands in the water oxidation mechanism remain largely unknown. In this study, we constructed a D1-D170H mutant, in which the Asp ligand bridging Mn and Ca ions was replaced with His, in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and analyzed isolated PSII core complexes using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS). The S-minus-S FTIR difference spectrum of the PSII complexes of the D1-D170H mutant showed features virtually identical to those of the wild-type PSII. MS analysis further showed that ~70% of D1 proteins from the PSII complexes of D1-D170H possessed the wild-type amino acid sequence, although only the mutated sequence was detected in genomic DNA in the same batch of cells for PSII preparations. In contrast, a D1-S169A mutant as a control showed a modified FTIR spectrum and only a mutated D1 protein. It is thus concluded that the FTIR spectrum of the D1-D170H mutant actually reflects that of wild-type PSII, whereas the MnCaO cluster is not formed in PSII with D1-D170H mutation. Although the mechanism of production of the wild-type D1 protein in the D1-D170H mutant is unknown at present, a caution is necessary in the analysis of site-directed mutants of crucial residues in the D1 protein, and mutation has to be confirmed not only at the DNA level but also at the amino acid level.Copyright © 2019.

The anti-algal activity of the photocatalytic pre-treatment using green microalgae, Chlorella vulgaris was tested. The experiments were carried out in freshwater, artificial seawater, and real seawater. Effect of photocatalyst dosage, visible light intensity, and water salinity on the removal of microalgae was investigated. The highest inactivation efficiency of Chlorella vulgaris was achieved under 55 W/m visible light irradiation when 0.25 g/L of FeO-TiO photocatalyst was used. The photocatalytic removal kinetics of Chlorella vulgaris followed the pseudo first order Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. The results revealed that the efficiency of photocatalytic removal of algae decreased with increasing of seawater salinity. The anti-algal activity of FeO-TiO nanoparticles was attributed to the generation of reactive  species (ROS) through the photocatalytic process. H radical was shown to be the most important ROS that nanoparticles produced in the aqueous media. Using FeO-TiO nanoparticles in photocatalytic pre-treatment could be an efficient environmental-friendly method for micro-algal remediation in seawater under visible light.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the relationship between abdominal obesity, diacron-reactive  metabolites (d-ROMs), and biological antioxidant potential (BAP) levels in Korean adults has not yet been proved. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between d-ROMs, BAP levels, and abdominal obesity in the Korean adult population using clinical data.A total of ,367 individuals, aged 18-86 years, were identified from health check-up examination records at a university hospital, between January 2015 and August 2016. Clinical and biochemical parameters, including waist circumference, lipid profile, alcohol drinking status, and smoking status, were investigated. Oxidative stress levels, viz., d-ROM concentration and antioxidant capacity, viz., BAP, were measured.Subjects with abdominal obesity presented significantly higher levels of d-ROMs compared to those with a normal waist circumference (P<0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, alcohol drinking status; smoking status; and triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein levels were found to have a significant positive correlation with abdominal obesity (P<0.001). BAP did not significantly correlate with abdominal obesity.We observed a positive association between abdominal obesity and d-ROM concentration. This result indicates that abdominal obesity can increase oxidative stress and may affect the pathways involved in obesity, such as the inflammatory pathway. Such correlation analyses were helpful in revealing the causes, as well as methods to reduce, oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677402>Enhanced ,4,6-trichlorophenol anaerobic degradation by FeO supported on water hyacinth biochar for triggering direct interspecies electron transfer and its use in coal gasification wastewater treatment.</a></h2><p>FeO supported on water hyacinth biochar (FeO/WHB) was successfully used in anaerobic degradation of ,4,6-trichlorophenol and coal gasification wastewater (CGW). Chemical  demand removal efficiency and methane production were significantly improved to 98.9% and .0 L with FeO/WHB assisted. FeO/WHB facilitated the conversion of CO to methane and reduce H production. A higher coenzyme F concentration of 1.32 μmol/(g-mixed liquor volatile suspended solids) was found with the presence of FeO/WHB, which might result in a faster conversion of acetate to methane. More interspecific signal molecules, lower diffusible signal factor, and higher mean particle size indicated that FeO/WHB accelerated the sludge granulation process. Microbial community analysis revealed that enriched bacteria Geobacter along with archaea Methanothrix and Methanosarcina may be involved in direct interspecies electron transfer by FeO/WHB stimulation, enhancing the performance of ,4,6-trichlorophenol fermentation. It is shown that use of FeO/WHB is feasible for enhanced CGW treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of renal tubular epithelial cells is one of the main processes involving renal fibrosis and its inhibition is considered as a preventive/therapeutic strategy for CKD. Trigonelline (TRIG), a plant alkaloid commonly found in herbs, coffee bean, soy bean and other edible food plants, has several beneficial effects on human health and has been proposed to reduce renal fibrosis but with unclear mechanisms. This study thus addressed cellular mechanism underlying the anti-fibrogenic effects of TRIG in renal tubular epithelial cells grown in vitro. EMT was successfully induced by oxalate treatment as indicated by morphological changes into spindle-shape cells, increased expression of mesenchymal proteins (fibronectin, vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)), decreased expression of epithelial proteins (E-cadherin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1)) and increased activity of a profibrotic factor (matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)). Interestingly, these oxalate-induced EMT features could be attenuated by TRIG pretreatment. Moreover, TRIG also prevented oxalate-induced cell migration, reactive  species (ROS) overproduction, and down-regulation of Nrf- signaling molecule. These data indicated that TRIG could attenuate the effects of oxalate-induced EMT and thus may serve as the anti-fibrotic compound for prevention and/or treatment of CKD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It is a unique example of an immune deficiency that is linked to dysfunctional mitochondrial energy metabolism and caused by adenylate kinase  (AK2) deficiency. It is characterized by an early differentiation arrest in the myeloid lineage, impaired lymphoid maturation, and sensorineural hearing loss. In this study, a novel AK2 homozygous mutation, c.622 T > C [p.Ser208Pro], was identified in an Old Order Amish patient through whole exome sequencing. Functional studies showed that the patient's cells have no detectable AK2 protein, as well as low  consumption rate (OCR), extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and proton production rate (PPR). An increased production of reactive  species, mitochondrial membrane permeability, and mitochondrial mass, and decreased ATP production, were also observed. The results confirm the pathogenicity of the AK2 mutation and demonstrate that reticular dysgenesis should be considered in Amish individuals presenting with immune deficiency.

It is currently used as an anchor disease, modifying anti-rheumatic drug in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Despite the development of numerous new targeted therapies, MTX remains the backbone of RA therapy due to its potent efficacy and tolerability. There has been also a growing interest in the use of MTX in the treatment of chronic viral mediated arthritis. Many viruses-including old world alphaviruses, Parvovirus B19, hepatitis B/C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus-have been associated with arthritogenic diseases and reminiscent of RA. MTX may provide benefits although with the potential risk of attenuating patients' immune surveillance capacities. In this review, we describe the emerging mechanisms of action of MTX as an anti-inflammatory drug and complementing its well-established immunomodulatory activity. The mechanisms involve adenosine signaling modulation, alteration of cytokine networks, generation of reactive  species and HMGB1 alarmin suppression. We also provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of MTX toxic effects.

Absorption, stability, catalytic behavior of immobilized enzymes and reusability of resultant fibrous bio-catalysts were comparatively studied. Full characterization of PN before and after respective modifications was carried out by various analytical, instrumental and arithmetic techniques. Results showed that modified polyester having amine terminal functional groups pledged better surface property providing up to 31% enzyme loading, and 81% active immobilized enzymes. The activity of the enzyme was measured in terms of interaction aptitude of GOx in a given time to produce hydrogen peroxide using colorimetric assay. The immobilized GOx retained 50% of its original activity after being reused six (06) times and exhibited improved stability compared with the free enzyme in relation to temperature. The reaction kinetics, loading efficiency, leaching, and reusability analysis of enzyme allowed drawing a parallel to the type of organic moiety integrated during GOx immobilization. In addition, resultant fibrous bio-catalysts showed substantial antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria strains (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli) in the presence of  and glucose. These results are of great importance because they provide proof-of-concept for robust immobilization of enzymes on surface-modified fibrous polyester fabric for potential bio-industrial applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677403>Computational fluid dynamics and factor analysis of a novel swirling demulsified airlift loop reactor for the treatment of refined soybean oil wastewater.</a></h2><p>A swirling demulsified airlift loop reactor (SD-ALR) was developed for the treatment of oily wastewater with yeasts. Computational fluid dynamics simulations showed that the gas holdup and liquid velocity gradient in the SD-ALR were .9% and 0.37 m/s higher than those in the traditional airlift loop reactor. The optimization results of the swirling demulsifier showed that the optimal number and elevation angle of the blades were 8 and 45°, and the optimal installation position was 150 mm from the bottom of the draft tube.

Reactive  species (ROS) impair cellular function by oxidizing cell components containing proteins, lipids, and DNA. Tumor oxidant status is elevated due to high metabolic activity under influence of abnormal growth factors, cytokines and function ROS-producing enzymes, including nitric oxide synthases, cyclooxygenases, and lipoxygenases. Nuclear factor-erythroid -related factor  (NRF2) is a transcriptional master regulator element which is believed to recognize cellular oxidative stress followed by binding to promoter of cyto-protective and anti-oxidative genes to maintain cellular redox status through promoting antioxidant response participants (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, thioredoxin reductase, ferritin, NADPH: quinone oxidoreductase 1). However, Nrf2 signaling protects malignant cells from ROS damage against tumor growth and chemoresistance. In addition, Nrf2 is able to participate in differentiation of certain stem cells by modulating autophagy procedure, also NRF2 provokes DNA damage response and facilitates drug metabolism and drug resistance by controlling of downstream enzyme and transporter members. In this review, we discuss the role of NRF2 in stemness, self-renewal ability, tumorigenesis and chemoresistance of CSCs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

They prolong the hospital stay and increase health care costs. A lung-protective ventilation strategy is considered better practice in abdominal surgery to prevent PPCs. However, the role of the inspiratory  fraction (FiO) in the strategy remains disputed. Previous trials have focused on reducing SSI by increasing the inhaled  concentration but higher FiO (80%) was found to be associated with a greater incidence of atelectasis and mortality in recent research. The trial aims at evaluating the effect of different FiO added to the lung-protective ventilation strategy on the incidence of PPCs during general anesthesia for abdominal surgery.PROtective Ventilation with a low versus high Inspiratory  fraction trial (PROVIO) is a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial planning to recruit 252 patients undergoing abdominal surgery lasting for at least  h. The patients will be randomly assigned to (1) a low-FiO (30% FiO) group and () a high-FiO (80% FiO) group in the lung-protective ventilation strategy.

However, burgeoning evidence suggests that E-cigarettes may adversely affect host defenses. However, the precise mechanisms by which E-cigarette vapor alters innate immune cell function have not been fully elucidated. We determined the effects of E-cigarette exposure on the function and responses to infectious challenge of the most abundant innate immune cell, the neutrophil, using isolated human neutrophils and a mouse model of Gram-negative infection. Our results revealed that human neutrophils exposed to E-cigarette vapor had 4.-fold reductions in chemotaxis towards the bacterial cell-well component f-Met-Leu-Phe (p < 0.001). F-actin polarization and membrane fluidity were also adversely affected by E-cigarette vapor exposure. E-cigarette exposed human neutrophils exhibited a 48% reduction in production of reactive  species (ROS; p < 0.001). Given the central role of ROS in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) production, NET production was quantified and E-cigarette vapor exposure was found to reduce NETosis by 3.5-fold (p < 0.01); formulations with and without nicotine containing propylene glycol exhibiting significant suppressive effects. However, non-canonical NETosis was unaffected. In addition, exposure to E-cigarette vapor lowered the rate of bacterial bioparticle phagocytosis by 47% (p < 0.05). In our physiologic mouse model of chronic E-cigarette exposure and sepsis, E-cigarette vapor inhalation led to reduced neutrophil migration into infected spaces and a higher burden of Pseudomonas.

NaGd(MoO4)-based materials have a scheelite structure with good thermal and chemical stability, and excellent up-conversion luminescence properties after co-doping rare earth ions (Tm3+ and Yb3+), which can effectively excite the photosensitizer to generate reactive  species (ROS). In this work, Tm3+ and Yb3+ co-doped NaGd(MoO4) upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are prepared by the sol-gel method and further complexed with photosensitizer MC540 (UCNPs@MC540). The prepared UCNPs showed a tetragonal phase and revealed nanoparticles with an average size of 150 nm. Under 980 nm excitation, the UCNPs exhibited a dominant blue emission band (1G4 → 3H6) of Tm3+, while the optimum doping concentration was identified at 1% Tm3+ and 20% Yb3+. In addition, the blue emissions of Tm3+ simultaneously activate the MC540 composited on the surface of the nanoparticles to produce a large amount of singlet  (1O2), which is detected by DCFH-DA.

During the progress of periodontitis, osteoclasts are solely accountable for the resorption of alveolar bones that leads to the loss of teeth if not properly treated. Thus, the development of effective anti-resorptive therapies will greatly benefit the treatment of periodontitis patients. In the present study, we suggest an inhibitory effect of 6-shogaol, an ingredient of ginger, on osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. Mouse bone marrow cells were cultured in the presence of macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) to investigate the effect of 6-shogaol on osteoclast differentiation and intracellular signaling pathways. 6-shogaol significantly reduced osteoclast differentiation, actin ring formation, and resorption. In the presence of 6-shogaol, osteoclast signaling including the RANKL-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, Ca oscillation, generation of reactive  species, and nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) nuclear translocation was significantly inhibited in vitro. Furthermore, a ligature-induced periodontitis model in mice was used to determine the role of 6-shoaol in vivo. The administration of 6-shogaol prevented osteoclastogenesis and alveolar bone resorption induced by ligature. Furthermore, the ligature-induced number of macrophages and neutrophils as well as the expression of interleukin 1-β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were considerably lower in the periodontal tissues following shogaol injection. These results confirm the anti-osteoclastogenic effect of 6-shogaol and suggest the possibility of application as an anti-resorptive strategy in periodontitis. This article is protected by copyright.

GSTZ1 is dysregulated in cancers; however, its role in tumorigenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is largely unknown. We aimed to assess the role of GSTZ1 in HCC and to reveal the underlying mechanisms, which may contribute to finding a potential therapeutic strategy against HCC.We first analyzed GSTZ1 expression levels in paired human HCC and adjacent normal tissue specimens and the prognostic effect of GSTZ1 on HCC patients. Thereafter, we evaluated the role of GSTZ1 in aerobic glycolysis in HCC cells on the basis of the  consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Furthermore, we assessed the effect of GSTZ1 on HCC proliferation, glutathione (GSH) concentration, levels of reactive  species (ROS), and nuclear factor erythroid -related factor  (NRF2) signaling via gain- and loss- of GSTZ1 function in vitro. Moreover, we investigated the effect of GSTZ1 on diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl) induced hepatocarcinogenesis in a mouse model of HCC.GSTZ1 was downregulated in HCC, thus indicating a poor prognosis. GSTZ1 deficiency significantly promoted hepatoma cell proliferation and aerobic glycolysis in HCC cells. Moreover, loss of GSTZ1 function depleted GSH, increased ROS levels, and enhanced lipid peroxidation, thus activating the NRF2-mediated antioxidant pathway. Furthermore, Gstz1 knockout in mice promoted DEN/CCl-induced hepatocarcinogenesis via activation of the NRF2 signaling pathway. Furthermore, the antioxidant agent N-acetylcysteine and NRF2 inhibitor brusatol effectively suppressed the growth of Gstz1-knockout HepG2 cells and HCC progression in Gstz1 mice.GSTZ1 serves as a tumor suppressor in HCC. GSH depletion caused by GSTZ1 deficiency elevates oxidative stress, thus constitutively activating the NRF2 antioxidant response pathway and accelerating HCC progression. Targeting the NRF2 signaling pathway may be a promising therapeutic approach for this subset of HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673289>Protein hydrolysis and fermentation under methanogenic and acidifying conditions.</a></h2><p>Many kinds of wastewaters contain appreciable quantities of protein. Anaerobic processes are suitable for the treatment of wastewater high in organics to achieve pollution control and recovery of energy as methane and hydrogen, or intermediates for production of biofuels and valuable biochemicals. A distinction between protein hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation, especially for dissolved proteins, is needed to target which one is truly rate-limiting and to effectively harvest bioproducts during anaerobic conversion of these wastewaters. This study explored mesophilic anaerobic hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation of gelatine, as a model for dissolved proteins, at pH 7 and at pH 5.The results showed that at pH 7, protein hydrolysis (first-order rate of 0.15 h) was approximately 5 times faster than acidification of the hydrolysis products (first-order rate of 0.03 h), implying that not hydrolysis but acidification was the rate-limiting step in anaerobic dissolved protein degradation. This was confirmed by (temporary) accumulation of amino acids. Nineteen different amino acids were detected during the first 8 incubation hours of gelatine at neutral pH and the total chemical  demand (COD) of these 19 amino acids was up to approximately 40% of the COD of the gelatine that was added. Protein hydrolysis at pH 5 was -25 times slower than at pH 7. Shifting the initial pH from neutral to acidic conditions (pH 5) inhibited protein degradation and changed the volatile fatty acids (VFA) product profile. Furthermore, the presence or absence of methanogenic activity did not affect the rates of protein hydrolysis and acidification.The findings in this study can help to set a suitable solid retention time to accomplish anaerobic degradation of protein-rich wastewaters in continuous reactor systems. For example, if the target is harvesting VFAs, methanogens can be washed-out for a shorter retention time while amino acid fermentation, instead of hydrolysis as assumed previously, will govern the design and solutions to improve the system dealing with dissolved proteins.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662347>TIPE2 specifies the functional polarization of myeloid-derived suppressor cells during tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are "polarized" myeloid cells that effectively promote tumorigenesis by inhibiting antitumor immunity. How myeloid cells acquire the protumoral properties during tumorigenesis is poorly understood. We report here that the polarity protein TIPE2 (tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like ) mediates the functional polarization of murine and human MDSCs by specifying their pro- and antitumoral properties. Tumor cells induced the expression of TIPE2 in Gr1CD11b cells through reactive  species (ROS). TIPE2 in turn increased the expression of protumoral mediators such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β while inhibiting the expression of antitumoral mediators. Consequently, tumor growth in TIPE2-deficient mice was significantly diminished, and TIPE2-deficient MDSCs markedly inhibited tumor growth upon adoptive transfer. Pharmaceutical blockade of ROS inhibited TIPE2 expression in MDSCs and reduced tumor growth in mice. These findings indicate that TIPE2 plays a key role in the functional polarization of MDSCs and represents a new therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.© 2019 Yan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670019>Visible-light-driven WO/BiOBr heterojunction photocatalysts for oxidative coupling of amines to imines: Energy band alignment and mechanistic insight.</a></h2><p>The visible-light-driven WO/BiOBr heterojunction was for the first time determined for its photocatalytic activity toward oxidative coupling of amines at room temperature using molecular  as a green oxidant. The WO/BiOBr heterojunction exhibits superior photocatalytic activity and photostability compared with pure BiOBr and WO due to an increased  vacancy concentration, an effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and an efficient interfacial charge transfer. Additionally, the WO/BiOBr also shows .3 and 41.1 times higher activity than that of TiO P25 and BiVO Alfa Aesar, respectively. Determination of energy band line-up indicates that the WO/BiOBr is a type II-heterojunction where electron-hole pairs are efficiently separated. Mechanistic studies based on radical quenching experiment, EPR trapping study and Hammett plot reveal that the main reaction pathway is the electron transfer route mediated by superoxide radical.

Caffeine is reported to have a function of protecting the liver and anti-tumor activity. Therefore, caffeine may be an ideal enhancer for HCC chemotherapy regimens. Our study showed that the combination of caffeine and 5-FU significantly inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells in vivo and in vitro comparing with caffeine or 5-FU monotherapy. The CI values of caffeine (0.5 mM) combined with 5-FU (25, 50 μM) were all less than 1, confirming that the utilization of drug combination has a synergistic inhibitory effect on the proliferation of HCC cells. Meanwhile, results of Western blot and TUNEL assays demonstrated that the apoptotic level of HCC cells in the combined group was significantly increased. The protein expression level of cleaved PARP was up-regulated, while the protein level of Bcl- and Bcl-xL was down-regulated. In addition, we found that ROS levels were increased in the 1 mM caffeine and 25 μM 5-FU combination group comparing with the control or single drug group.

Previous studies, conducted mostly with terrestrial plant communities, found controversial evidence for this prediction. We provide here the first test for SDH for epiphytic diatoms. We studied community assembly in diatom communities of astatic ponds. These water bodies serve as a good model system for testing SDH because they exhibit stress gradients of various environmental factors. Functional diversity of diatom communities was assessed based on four traits: (1) combined trait reflecting the trade-off between stress tolerance and competitive dominance, () cell size, (3)  requirement and (4) N-uptake strategy. According to our results, salinity, pH and the width of the macrophyte belt appeared as significant predictors of the trait convergence/divergence patterns presumably acting through influencing the availability of carbon dioxide and turbidity. Lower trait diversity was found in turbid, more saline and more alkaline ponds and functional diversity was higher in transparent, less saline and less alkaline ponds. Overall, our results supported the stress dominance hypothesis. In habitats representing increased environmental stress, environmental filtering was the most important community assembly rule, while limiting similarity became dominant under more favourable conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663313>Mechanical power during an incremental test can be estimated from 2000-m rowing ergometer performance.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to identify the relationship between the mean power output of 2000-m rowing ergometer performance with the peak power output obtained during an incremental test, in addition to verifying the possibility of using the 2000-m mean power as an intensity associated with V̇O2max.Nineteen rowers (age 25.5 ± 10.6 years; V̇O2PEAK: 65.4 ± 5.8 mL.kg.min-1) completed an incremental test followed by a 2000-m familiarization test (day 1) and a 2000- m rowing ergometer test (day ). During the incremental test, the peak power output (PV̇O2PEAK) and the exercise intensity thresholds were determined. The maximal  uptake (V̇O2PEAK) was analyzed in both tests.The PV̇O2PEAK (284.8 ± 44.7 W) presented the highest correlation coefficient (r = 0.978) with 2000-m mean power (284. ± 49.9 W) and was the only one included in stepwise regression explaining 96% of 2000-m mean power. V̇O2PEAK was lower in the incremental test (4.69 ± 0.61 L.min-1) compared with the 2000-m rowing ergometer test (4.86 ± 0.63 L.min-1; P = 0.01) with a small bias ± LoA (0.16 ± 0.53 L.min-1).In conclusion, 2000-m mean power is a valid tool to estimate the PV̇O2PEAK and allow the achievement of V̇O2PEAK.

Here, four monoanionic Au bisdithiolate complexes [Au(mnt)] (where mnt = 1,1-dicyanoethylene-,-dithiolate)(1), [Au(i-mnt)] (where i-mnt = ,-dicyanoethylene-1,1-dithiolate)(), [Au(cdc)] (where cdc = cyanodithioimido carbonate)(3), and [Au(qdt)] (where qdt = quinoxaline-,3-dithiolate)(4) were screened for their antimicrobial and antitumor activities. Complexes 3 and 4 showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus [minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 15.3 and 14.7 μg/mL, respectively]. Complex 3 also caused significant growth inhibition of Candida glabrata (MIC = 7.0 μg/mL). Concentrations of complexes 1-4 up to 125 μg/mL had no growth inhibition activity against Escherichia coli. The cytotoxic activity of complexes 1-4 was evaluated against the ovarian cancer cells A2780 and A2780cisR, sensitive and resistant to cisplatin, respectively. All compounds showed high cytotoxic activities against both tumoral cell lines, exhibiting IC values in the low micromolar range (0.9-5.5 μM) upon 48 h incubation. In contrast to complex 1, the complexes -4 induced a dose-dependent formation of reactive  species (ROS), similar to the observed for the reference drugs auranofin and cisplatin. Opposite to 4, complexes 1-3 were able to activate caspase 3/7, suggesting the involvement of apoptosis in the mechanism of cell death. Contrasting with cisplatin, complexes 3, 4 and auranofin did not cause DNA damage. Combined, these data provide evidence that these monoanionic gold bisdithiolates, particularly complex 3, are potential lead compounds to further explore as therapeutic drugs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Theory points to galactic winds as the primary source of the enriched and massive circumgalactic medium. Winds from compact starbursts have been observed to flow to distances somewhat greater than ten kiloparsecs, but the circumgalactic medium typically extends beyond a hundred kiloparsecs. Here we report optical integral field observations of the massive but compact galaxy SDSS J211824.06+001729.4. The  [O II] lines at wavelengths of 3726 and 3729 angstroms reveal an ionized outflow spanning 80 by 100 square kiloparsecs, depositing metal-enriched gas at 10,000 kelvin through an hourglass-shaped nebula that resembles an evacuated and limb-brightened bipolar bubble. We also observe neutral gas phases at temperatures of less than 10,000 kelvin reaching distances of 20 kiloparsecs and velocities of around 1,500 kilometres per second. This multi-phase outflow is probably driven by bursts of star formation, consistent with theory.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676295>Mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy stimulation and non-apoptotic cell death caused by nitric oxide-inducing Pt-coated Au nanoparticle in human lung carcinoma cells.</a></h2><p>Reactive  species (ROS)-mediated cancer therapeutic has been at higher appreciation than those mediated by reactive nitrogen species. Cytotoxic mechanism of a novel nitric oxide (NO) inducing-Pt coated Au nanoparticle (NP) has been comparatively studied with the well-established ROS inducing Pt-based anticancer drug cisplatin in human lung A549 carcinoma cells.Cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, thiobarbituric acid substances (TBARS) and C11-Boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY). ROS (O and HO) was measured with dihydroethidium (DHE) and HO-specific sensor. Nitric oxide (NO) and mitochondrial dysfunction were evaluated respectively by NO-specific probe DAR-1 and JC-1. Autophagy was determined by lysotracker (LTR) and monodansylcadaverine (MDC) applied tandemly whereas apoptosis/necrosis by Hoechst/PI and caspase 3 activity.IC50 (concentration that inhibited cell viability by 50%) of Pt coated Au NP came to be 0.413 μM whereas IC50 of cisplatin came out to 86.5 μM in A549 cells treated for 24 h meaning NPs toxicity was over 200 times higher than cisplatin. However, no significant stimulation of intracellular ROS was observed at the IC50 of Pt coated Au NPs in A549 cells. However, markers like LDH release, TBARS, BODIPY and ROS were significantly higher due to cisplatin in comparison to Pt coated Au NP.Pt coated Au NP caused NO-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagy. Mode of cell death due to NP was much different from ROS-inducing cisplatin.Pt coated Au NP offer promising opportunity in cancer therapeutic and warrants advanced study in vivo models of cancer.Copyright © 2019.

From February 2017 to May 2018, 30 patients admitted to Burn Department of our hospital with severe burns who met the criteria for inclusion and needed escharectomy and skin grafting were enrolled in this prospective randomized controlled trial. The patients were divided into group GDFM of 15 cases [14 males and 1 female, (45±14) years old] and conventional liquid management group of 15 cases [12 males and 3 females, (42±10) years old] according to the random number table. During escharectomy and skin grafting, volume of patients in group GDFM was managed according to the GDFM scheme, based on cardiac output index, stroke volume variation, stroke volume index, hemoglobin, central venous  saturation (ScvO()), and other parameters; volume of patients in conventional liquid management group was managed according to clinical experience and conventional liquid management scheme, based on mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, urine output, hemoglobin, and other parameters. At post operation hour (POH) 1, 6, 12, and 24, arterial and venous blood was collected from patients of the two groups to determine the levels of extravascular lung water index (ELWI), global end-diastolic volume index (GEDI), oxygenation index, ScvO(), central venous-to-arterial blood carbon dioxide partial pressure difference (Pcv-aCO()), lactic acid, pH value, bicarbonate ion, and base excess routinely. Data were processed with Fisher's exact probability test,  test, analysis of variance for repeated measurement, and least significant difference test.  (1) The ELWI of patients in group GDFM was (4.3±1.1) mL/kg at POH 1, which was significantly lower than (6.5±3.6) mL/kg in conventional liquid management group (=.26, <0.05).

The GEDI levels between patients of the two groups were similar, and there was no significantly statistical difference between the two groups as a whole (treatment factor main effect =.35, time factor main effect =0.44, interaction =0.07, >0.05). () The oxygenation index of patients in group GDFM was (350±78) mL/kg at POH 1, which was significantly higher than (259±109) mL/kg in conventional liquid management group (=.63, <0.05). In conventional liquid management group, the oxygenation index of patients at POH 6 was significantly higher than that at POH 1, 12, or 24 (<0.01). The ScvO() levels of patients in group GDFM at POH 1, 6, and 12 were 0.516±0.105, 0.679±0.121, and 0.713±0.104, respectively, which were significantly higher than 0.382±0.194, 0.545±0.194, and 0.595±0.191 in conventional liquid management group (=.35, .27, .10, <0.05). The ScvO() levels of patients in the two groups at POH 6, 12, and 24 were significantly higher than those levels at POH 1 within the same group (<0.01), and the ScvO() of patients in conventional liquid management group at POH 24 was significantly higher than that at POH 6 or 12 within the same group (<0.05 or <0.01). The Pcv-aCO() levels of patients in group GDFM were significantly lower than those in conventional liquid management group at POH 1 and 6 (=.55, .71, <0.05). The Pcv-aCO() of patients in group GDFM at POH 12 was significantly lower than that at POH 6 or 24 within the same group (<0.05). (3) The blood lactic acid levels and pH values between patients of the two groups were similar at POH 1, 6, 12, and 24 (=0.89, 0.19, 0.26, 0.23; 1.55, 0.71, 0.77, 0.77, >0.05). In conventional liquid management group, the blood lactic acid levels of patients at POH 6, 12, and 24 were significantly lower than the level at POH 1 within the same group (<0.05), and the pH values of patients at POH 6, 12, and 24 were significantly higher than the value at POH 1 within the same group (<0.05). The levels of bicarbonate ion and base excess between patients of the two groups were similar, and there were no significantly statistical differences between the two groups as a whole (treatment factor main effect =0.06, 0.11, time factor main effect =.07, 1.59, interaction =1.45, 0.91, >0.05).

Here, we investigated effects and underlying mechanisms of LiCl on lipid accumulation. LiCl induced dose-dependent lipid accumulation in HepG2 and RAW264.7 cells under normal as well as high glucose conditions. LiCl exposure additionally promoted lipid accumulation in livers of zebrafish. SB216763, a specific GSK-3β inhibitor, did not affect lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Expression of key lipogenic enzymes, such as FAS and aP2, as well as SR-B1 were increased in RAW264.7 cells. LiCl enhanced FAS, ACC and SCD-1 mRNA levels while suppressing CPT-1 in HepG2 cells. LiCl stimulated DNA binding activities of SREBP-1c and ChREBP. LiCl activated AMPK phosphorylation but the AMPK inhibitor, AICAR, did not suppress LiCl-induced lipid accumulation in RAW264.7. LiCl, but not SB216763, induced a significant increase in ROS in RAW264.7 and HepG2 cells. NOX activity was dose-dependently enhanced by LiCl. Furthermore, NOX-1, NOX- and DUOX-1 mRNA levels were upregulated at an early stage of LiCl stimulation. LiCl-induced lipid accumulation was suppressed by the antioxidant, NAC, and inhibitors of NOX, DPI and APO. Phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of CREB were enhanced by LiCl. The cell-permeable cAMP analog, di-butyryl cAMP, not only promoted lipid accumulation itself but also LiCl-induced lipid accumulation in RAW264.7 cells. H-89, a PKA inhibitor, suppressed CREB activation, lipid accumulation and NOX activity in RAW264.7 cells. Our results indicate that LiCl stimulates lipid accumulation in hepatocyte and macrophage cells potentially through increased PKA-dependent ROS production.Copyright © 2019.

To determine whether a single dose of Zynamite administered 1 h before exercise increases repeated-sprint performance, 20 men and 20 women who were physically active were randomly assigned to three treatments following a double-blind cross-over counterbalanced design. Treatment A, 140 mg of Zynamite, 140 mg of quercetin, 147.7 mg of maltodextrin, and 420 mg of sunflower lecithin; Treatment B, 140 mg of Zynamite, 140 mg of quercetin, and 2126 mg of maltodextrin and Treatment C, 2548 mg of maltodextrin (placebo). Subjects performed three Wingate tests interspaced by 4 min and a final 15 s sprint after ischemia. Treatments A and B improved peak power output during the first three Wingates by .8% and 3.8%, respectively (treatment x sprint interaction,  = 0.01). Vastus Lateralis oxygenation (NIRS) was reduced, indicating higher O extraction (treatment × sprint interaction,  = 0.01). Improved O extraction was observed in the sprints after ischemia ( = 0.008; placebo vs. mean of treatments A and B). Blood lactate concentration was 5.9% lower after the ingestion of Zynamite® with quercetin in men (treatment by sex interaction,  = 0.049). There was a higher Vastus Lateralis O extraction during 60 s ischemia with polyphenols (treatment effect,  = 0.03), due to the greater muscle VO in men ( = 0.001). In conclusion, a single dose of Zynamite combined with quercetin one hour before exercise improves repeated-sprint performance and muscle O extraction and mitochondrial O consumption during ischemia.

They can be acquired from medical waste such as adipose and umbilical cord tissues, are influenced by culturing conditions, and exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-fibrotic, and angiogenic effects. We analyzed the multi-directional effects of MSCs cultured under hypoxic conditions and their underlying mechanisms in the treatment of liver cirrhosis in a mouse model.Human bone marrow-derived MSCs cultured under hypoxic (5% O; hypoMSCs) and normoxic (21% O; norMSCs) conditions were compared by cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) with or without serum from liver cirrhosis patients. The therapeutic effects of MSCs, including serum liver enzyme induction, fibrosis regression, and hepatic oxidative stress, were evaluated by injecting 1 × 10,  × 10, or 4 × 10 MSCs/mouse into the tail veins of mice with carbon tetrachloride (CCl)-induced liver cirrhosis. Intravital imaging was performed with a two-photon excitation microscope to confirm the various MSC migration paths to the liver.CAGE analysis revealed that the RNA expression levels of prostaglandin E synthase () and miR210 were significantly higher in hypoMSCs than in norMSCs.  analysis revealed that both hypoMSCs and norMSCs reduced serum alanine aminotransferase, oxidative stress, and fibrosis compared to that in control mice in a dose-dependent manner. However, hypoMSCs had stronger therapeutic effects than norMSCs. We confirmed this observation by an  study in which hypoMSCs changed macrophage polarity to an anti-inflammatory phenotype via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) stimulation. In addition, miR210 reduced the rate of hepatocyte apoptosis. Intravital imaging after MSC administration showed that both cell types were primarily trapped in the lungs. Relatively a few hypoMSCs and norMSCs migrated to the liver. There were no significant differences in their distributions.The therapeutic effect of hypoMSCs was mediated by PGE2 and miR210 production and was greater than that of norMSCs. Therefore, MSCs can be manipulated to improve their therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of liver cirrhosis and could potentially serve in effective cell therapy. MSCs produce several factors with multidirectional effects and function as "conducting cells" in liver cirrhosis.© 2019 The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine.

We studied the long term effects of the intrascrotal administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) during detorsion procedure in a rat model of testicular torsion.Twenty-eight rats were divided into 4 groups: (1) Control group: No procedure was done (): Torsion-detorsion group: Testis torsion applied for 3 h (3): Low Dose Group: After testis torsion-detorsion (for 3 h) 10 mg/kg NAC was given into tunica vaginalis (4): High Dose Group: After testis torsion-detorsion (for 3 h) 100 mg/kg NAC was given into tunica vaginalis. We measured dimensions of the testes and examined pathological findings and Johnsen and Cosantino Scores.For testes height and volume, high dose NAC group had better results than the torsion-detorsion group (p = 0.019, p = 0.049). Testes weight showed no difference (p = 0.204). Sertoli cell number per tubule in the high dose NAC group was statistically different than the torsion-detorsion group (p = 0.017).When NAC was given intrascrotally at a dose of 100 mg/kg, it decreased the loss of testis volume and height, and Sertoli cell number per tubule was similar to the control group. These results suggest that the higher dose intrascrotal NAC administered during detorsion may have a protective effect.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

An alternative cellular source is insulin-producing cells derived from pluripotent cell sources. Three animal cohorts were used in the current study to evaluate whether an -providing macro-encapsulation device, 'βAIR', could function in conjunction with human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and their derivatives. The first cohort received macro-encapsulated undifferentiated hESCs, a second cohort received hESCs differentiated to a pancreatic progenitor state with limited endocrine differentiation. A reference cohort received human islets. Macro-encapsulation devices were implanted subcutaneously and monitored for up to 4 months. Undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells did not form teratoma but underwent cell death following implantation. Human C-peptide (hC- peptide) was detectable in host serum one week after implantation for both other cohorts. hC-peptide levels decreasing over time but remained detectable up to the end of the study. Key factors associated with mature endocrine cells were observed in grafts recovered from cohorts containing islets and hESC-derivatives including C-peptide, insulin, glucagon and urocortin 3.

Furthermore, the mechanisms by which IRI causes EG damage have not been fully elucidated. The aims of this study were to determine if hypoxia alone or hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) caused greater damage to the glycocalyx, and if this damage was mediated by reactive  species (ROS) and Ca signaling.Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured to confluence and exposed to either normoxia (30 minutes), hypoxia (% O2 for 30 minutes), or H/R (30 minutes hypoxia followed by 30 minutes normoxia). Some cells were pretreated with ROS scavengers TEMPOL, MitoTEMPOL, Febuxostat, or Apocynin, or with the Ca chelator BAPTA or Ca channel blockers -aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, A967079, Pyr3, or ML204. Intracellular ROS was quantified for all groups. Endothelial glycocalyx was measured using fluorescently tagged wheat germ agglutinin and imaged with fluorescence microscopy.Glycocalyx thickness was decreased in both hypoxia and H/R groups, with the decrease being greater in the H/R group. TEMPOL, MitoTEMPOL, BAPTA, and -aminoethoxydiphenyl borate prevented loss of glycocalyx in H/R. The ROS levels were likewise elevated compared with normoxia in both groups, but were increased in the H/R group compared with hypoxia alone. BAPTA did not prevent ROS production in either group.In our cellular model for shock, we demonstrate that although hypoxia alone is sufficient to produce glycocalyx loss, H/R causes a greater decrease in glycocalyx thickness. Under both conditions damage is dependent on ROS and Ca signaling. Notably, we found that ROS are generated upstream of Ca, but that ROS-mediated damage to the glycocalyx is dependent on Ca.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668451>Plant-Pathogen Interactions: Underestimated Roles of Phyto-oxylipins.</a></h2><p>Plant (or phyto-) oxylipins (POs) are produced under a wide range of stress conditions and although they are well known to activate stress-related signalling pathways, the nonsignalling roles of POs are poorly understood. We describe oxylipins as direct biocidal agents and propose that structure-function relationships play here a pivotal role. Based on their chemical configuration, POs, such as reactive  and electrophile species, activate defence-related gene expression. We also propose that their ability to interact with pathogen membranes is important, but still misunderstood, and that they are involved in cross-kingdom communication.

Here, the adsorption behavior of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) onto AuNP was studied by all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We found that β-CD binding onto the AuNP surface occurs through multiple non-covalent interactions, among which non-covalent binding of the aliphatic carbon moieties and the hydroxyl  atoms plays a vital role. Surprisingly, the MD analysis revealed that the most preferred binding mode of the β-CD molecules onto the gold surface corresponds to the toroid side geometry. Only minor populations of β-CD molecules were observed, in which the adsorbate molecules are bound onto AuNP by either its primary or secondary rims, respectively. The adsorbed β-CDs formed the multiple-layer coating on AuNP, composed up to three adsorbate layers. We found that for AuNP of the size of .9 nm, the maximum water-protecting efficiency of the adsorbate coating occurs upon reaching a value of 40 β-CD molecules, the further increase in the adsorbate content resulted in some self-aggregation of β-CD molecules onto the gold surface. Our findings provide the molecular-level understanding of the adsorption behavior of β-CD onto gold, which is relevant for various applications of CD-capped gold nanostructures.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The research question was, "Are fenestrated tracheostomy tubes a safe and effective option to facilitate early phonation in patients undergoing tracheostomy?" Studies of fenestrated tracheostomy tubes were assessed for risk of bias and quality of evidence. Data were abstracted, cross-checked for accuracy, and synthesized.Of the 160 studies identified, 13 met inclusion criteria, including 6 clinical studies (104 patients), 6 case reports (13 patients), and 1 nationwide clinician survey. The primary indications for a tracheostomy were chronic ventilator dependence (83%) and airway protection (17%). Indications for fenestrated tracheostomy included inaudible phonation and poor voice intelligibility. Patients with fenestrated tubes achieved robust voice outcomes. Complications included granulation tissue (6 patients [5%]), malpositioning (1 patient [0.9%]), decreased  saturation (3 patients [.6%]), increased blood pressure (1 patient [0.9%]), increased peak pressures ( patients [1.7%]), and air leakage (1 patient [0.9%]); subcutaneous emphysema also occurred frequently. Patient-reported symptoms included shortness of breath (4 patients [3.4%]), anxiety (3 patients [.6%]), and chest discomfort (1 patient [0.9%]).Fenestrated devices afford benefits for speech and decannulation but carry risks of granulation, aberrant airflow, and acclimation challenges.

To examine the toxicity of metals found in the effluent discharges from an electroplating industry, physicochemical parameters in the microalga C. vulgaris were measured. pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids, color, and the concentrations of metals such as chromium (1.97 mg/L), mercury (104. mg/L), and zinc (167.25 mg/L) were found exceeding the permissible limits. Several endpoints such as total protein content, reactive  species (ROS) production, photosynthetic pigment contents, and antioxidant enzymatic activities, including those of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), were measured in C. vulgaris in response to treated electroplating industrial effluent (TEPIE). In addition, concentration-dependent morphological changes were also observed in response to TEPIE. Under both acute and chronic TEPIE exposure, increase in the ROS level was observed indicating increased production of ROS in C. vulgaris cells. The total protein and chlorophyll contents were found to be gradually decreasing in an effluent concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, lower concentrations of effluent stimulated the antioxidant enzyme systems. A concentration-dependent increase was observed in both SOD and CAT enzymatic activities. The results indicated toxic impairments by the effluent on the function of C. vulgaris in response to both acute and chronic exposure, indicating an urgent need of proper treatment processes/modification of the existing one of TEPIE, with continuous monitoring of the discharge of the pollutants into the aquatic ecosystems using biological assays.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

LDL-based SRF/DHA-loaded lipid nanoparticles (LD-SDN) showed remarkable decrease in the cell viability compared to that of either of single drug treated cancer cells. Combination of SRF+DHA resulted in predominant SubG1 proportion of cells. LD-SDN exhibited the highest SubG1 (%) of cells compared to that of any of the individual drugs. Most importantly, robust antitumor response and delayed tumor growth was observed for LD-SDN treated xenograft tumor model. Ki67 proliferation index of LD-SDN (22.1±5.6%) is significantly lesser compared to that of either control (86.±6.9%) or SRF (75.4±4.89%) or DHA (69.4±6.9%).These data provide strong evidence that LDL-mimetic lipid nanoformulations could be utilized as a biocompatible and tumor targeted platform for the delivery of multiple anticancer drugs in cancer treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, one of the issues of PDT is the need for  to induce a photodynamic effect. Tumours often have low  concentrations, related to the abnormal structure of the microvessels leading to an ineffective blood distribution. Moreover, PDT consumes O. In order to improve the oxygenation of tumour or decrease hypoxia, different strategies are developed and are described in this review: 1) The use of O vehicle; ) the modification of the tumour microenvironment (TME); 3) combining other therapies with PDT; 4) hypoxia-independent PDT; 5) hypoxia-dependent PDT and 6) fractional PDT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671472>A rapid ammonium fluoride method to determine the  isotope ratio of available phosphorus in tropical soils.</a></h2><p>The isotopic composition of  bound to phosphorus (δ O value) offers an opportunity to gain insight into P cycling mechanisms. However, there is little information for tropical forest soils, which present a challenge for δ O measurements due to low available P concentrations. Here we report the use of a rapid ammonium fluoride extraction method (Bray-1) as an alternative to the widely used anion-exchange membrane (AEM) method for quantification of δ O values of available P in tropical forest soils.We compared P concentrations and δ O values of available and microbial P determined by AEM and Bray-1 extraction for a series of tropical forest soils from Panama spanning a steep P gradient. This involved an assessment of the influence of extraction conditions, including temperature, extraction time, fumigation time, and solution-to-soil ratio, on P concentrations and isotope ratios.Depending on the extraction conditions, Bray-1 P concentrations ranged from 0. to 66.3 mg P kg across the soils. Extraction time and temperature had only minor effects on Bray-1 P, but concentrations increased markedly as the solution-to-soil ratio increased. In contrast, extraction conditions did not affect Bray-1 δ O values, indicating that Bray-1 provides a robust measure of the isotopic composition of available soil P. For a relatively high P soil, available and fumigation-released (microbial) δ O values determined by Bray-1 extraction (20‰ and 16‰, respectively) were higher than those determined by AEM (18‰ and 12‰, respectively), which we attribute to slightly different P pools extracted by the two methods and/or differences resulting from the longer extraction time for the AEM method.The short extraction time, insensitivity to extraction conditions, and smaller mass of soil required to extract sufficient P for isotopic analysis, make Bray-1 extraction a suitable alternative to the AEM method for the determination of δ O values of available P in tropical soils.This article is protected by copyright.

[O]HO is used as a perfusion tracer, and [C]acetate as an oxidative metabolism in this purpose, requiring two injections to assess those fundamental parameters. Yet, in cardiac physiology study, the high first-pass myocardial extraction fraction of [C]acetate allowed to use its influx rate as a blood flow marker too. Since [C]acetate has been characterized by a 20-25% single pass renal extraction in dogs, it could be used as a potential tracer for renal perfusion. The aim of this study was to determine whether [C]acetate influx rate can be used as quantitative in vivo marker of kidney perfusion in human.In 10 healthy subjects, dynamic PET acquisitions were performed after [O]HO and [C]acetate injections spaced by a 15-minute interval. As previously validated, with compartmental modeling of kinetics, renal perfusion and oxidative metabolism were estimated respectively with influx rate of [O]HO and efflux rate of [C]acetate. Additionally, influx rate of [C]acetate was regressed to influx rate of [O]HO.Renal time activity curves of [C]-acetate was best fitted with a mono compartmental model compared to a bi-compartmental model (p < 0.0001). [C]acetate influx rate was significantly correlated with perfusion quantified with [O]HO (r = 0.37, p < 0.001) at baseline. This regression allowed the computation of a renal [C]acetate extraction fraction (EF), and further the computation of renal blood flow from its influx rate.In healthy subjects, over a wide range of renal perfusion, direct estimates of renal  consumption as well as tissue perfusion can be obtained by PET with a single tracer [C]acetate. This approach needs to be validated in CKD patients, and would be of great interest to design clinical protocol aiming at evaluating ischemic nephropathies candidate to revascularization.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Twelve (6 females and 6 males) amateur athletes familiarized with all experimental procedures had their anthropometric data obtained on day 1. On days  and 3 either 8 mg of TER or a placebo (PLA) was administered orally (double-blind manner) to participants who had rested for 3 h prior to aerobic exercise performance 20 m multistage fitness test (MSFT)]. This test was used to predict maximal  uptake (VO) and velocity at which VO occurs (vVO). The Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE), cardiovascular variables [heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP)] and blood glucose concentration [BGC] were obtained 15 min pre- and immediately post-MSFT. Significant mean group differences were reported between PLA and TER groups (p < 0.05), respectively, in the RPE (15.6 ± 1. vs. 17.3 ± 1.5 a.u.), maximum heart rate (HR: 191. ± 7.1 vs. 197. ± 8.6 bpm) and BGC (118.4 ± 18.3 vs. 141. ± 15.8 mg/dL) post-MSFT. The main effect of gender (male vs. female) in TER and PLA groups (p< 0.05) was observed, with higher estimated VO, vVO, HR and a lower mean HR pre-test in male than female athletes. For these reasons, the inclusion of TER in the Prohibited List should be re-discussed because of the lack of ergogenic effects.© 2019 Hanen Hafedh, Maamer Slimani, Bianca Miarka, Ramzi Bettayeb, Nicola Luigi Bragazzi, published by Sciendo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678866>Activation of RAW264.7 macrophages by active fraction of Albizia julibrissin saponin via Ca-ERK1/-CREB-lncRNA pathways.</a></h2><p>The saponin active fraction from the stem bark of Albizia julibrissin (AJSAF) is an ideal vaccine adjuvant, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. The recent evidences indicate that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in regulating the activation and function of macrophages. The current experiments were designed to investigate the effects of AJSAF on the activation of RAW264.7 macrophages and to explore its intracellular molecular mechanisms using a global gene expression microarray. AJSAF could significantly enhance phagocytic activity, induce reactive  species (ROS), promote surface molecule expression, and up-regulate the mRNA and protein expression of cytokines and chemokines in RAW264.7 cells. AJSAF induced the differential expression of 223 mRNAs and 103 lncRNAs in RAW264.7 cells. Bioinformatics were used to predict the potential target mRNAs and function of up-regulated lncRNA A_30_P01018532 in RAW264.7 cells induced by AJSAF. The total 99 co-expressed mRNAs were classified as putative target genes of A_30_P01018532. A_30_P01018532 was associated with the inflammatory and immune response. AJSAF significantly increased the intracellular free Ca levels and induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/ and CREB in RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, Ca chelator BAPTA-AM, ERK1/ inhibitor PD98059 and CREB inhibitor KG-501 significantly inhibited the up-regulation of TNF-α, CCL2, CXCL2, CCL22, and A_30_P01018532 in RAW264.7 cells induced by AJSAF. These results suggested that AJSAF could activate RAW264.7 cells via Ca-ERK1/-CREB pathways and that A_30_P01018532 might be an important regulator of mRNA expression in AJSAF-activated macrophage. This study may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of action of AJSAF.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to investigate the plasma proteomic/cytokine profile of pregnant BN rats in comparison to that of the Lewis (LEW) rat strain.Plasma proteomics differences were studied at day 13 of pregnancy in pooled plasma samples by differential in-gel electrophoresis, and protein identification was performed by mass spectrometry. Key protein findings and predicted cytokine differences were validated by ELISA using plasma from rats at various pregnancy stages. Proteomics data were used for Ingenuity Pathway analysis.In-gel analysis revealed 74 proteins with differential expression between BN and LEW pregnant dams. ELISA studies confirmed increased maternal plasma levels of complement 4, prothrombin, and C-reactive protein in BN compared to LEW pregnancies. LEW pregnancies showed higher maternal plasma levels of transthyretin and haptoglobin than BN pregnancies. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that BN pregnancies are characterized by activation of pro-coagulant, reactive  species, and immune-mediated chronic inflammation pathways, and suggested increased interleukin 6 and decreased transforming growth factor-β1 as potential upstream events. Plasma cytokine analysis revealed that pregnant BN dams have a switch from anti- to pro-inflammatory cytokines with the opposite switch observed in pregnant LEW dams.BN rats show a maternal pro-inflammatory response to pregnancy that likely contributes to the reproductive outcomes observed in this rat strain.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

High altitude (HA) may be involved in IOP, but the reported results were conflicting. Ascent to HA directly by plane from low altitude regions is an acute, effortless exposure. However, the effects of such exposure to different altitudes on IOP have rarely been reported.To investigate changes in IOP after rapid effortless exposure to HA in stages and compare it with systemic parameters.Fifty-eight healthy subjects (116 eyes) were divided into three groups: 17 low-altitude (LA) residents [44 m above sea level (ASL)], 22 HA residents (2261 m ASL) and 19 very HA (VHA) residents (3750 m ASL). The LA group flew to HA first. Three days later, they flew with the HA group to VHA where both groups stayed for  d. Then, the LA group flew back to HA and stayed for 1 d before flying back to 44 m. IOP,  saturation (SpO) and pulse rate were measured. The linear mixed model was used to compare repeated measurements.IOP in the LA group significantly decreased from 18.41 ± .40 mmHg at 44 m to 13.60 ± 3.68 mmHg at 2261 m ASL ( < 0.001), and then to 11.85 ± .48 mmHg at 3750 m ASL ( = 0.036 compared to IOP at 2261 m ASL) and partially recovered to 13.47 ± .57 mmHg upon return to 44 m. IOP in the LA group at HA and VHA was comparable to that in the local residents (12. ± .4 mmHg for HA,11.5 ± 1.8 mmHg for VHA). IOP was positively associated with SpO.IOP in the LA group gradually reduced as altitude elevated in stages and became comparable to IOP in local residents. Hypoxia may be associated with IOP, which deserves further study.©The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

A key challenge is the unambiguous identification of spectroscopic fingerprints which can be used to track their function. Herein, we employ five complementary techniques to modulate the electronic occupancy of states associated with  vacancies  in BiVO photoanodes, allowing us to identify a spectral signature for the ionisation of these states. We obtain an activation energy of ̴ 0. eV for this ionisation process, with thermally activated electron de-trapping from these states determining the kinetics of electron extraction, consistent with improved photoelectrochemical performance at higher temperatures. Bulk, un-ionised states however, function as deep hole traps, with such trapped holes being energetically unable to drive water oxidation. These observations help address recent controversies in the literature over  vacancy function, providing new insights into their impact upon photoelectrochemical performance.</p></html>
