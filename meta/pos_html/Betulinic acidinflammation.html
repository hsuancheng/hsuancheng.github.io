It is used traditionally for several pharmacological purposes including anti-, antidiarrhoeal and antibacterial, as well as tonic and sometimes as hypnotic (sedative).To determine the in vivo antidiarrhoeal, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of  fruit ethanolic extract.The fruit was macerated and extracted by 95% (v/v) ethanol. The antidiarrhoeal activity was evaluated using castor oil and  induced diarrhoea mouse model. The antidiarrhoeal and antibacterial activity was investigated at graded doses (400-1200 mg/kg). The anti-inflammatory effects were tested using the carrageenan-induced paw oedema in female Wistar rats. Rat's treatment groups received tragacanth, 100 mg/kg diclofenac sodium, 800 mg/kg, 1200 mg/kg or 1600 mg/kg of an ethanolic extract of  (EEZJ). All treatment groups were fed with the compounds one hour before carrageenan injection at of rat's paw. Also, the EEZJ was further analysed by HPLC-PDA system for identification of the presence of  and quercetin.EEZJ different doses did not show inhibitory activity against castor oil induced diarrhoea except for the higher (1200 mg/kg) dose. However, the frequency of defecation of stools and watery stool were reduced significantly when compared to control group (P ≤ 0.05 and P ≤ 0.01 respectively), resulted in overall 67% inhibition of diarrhoea. Our anti-inflammatory results demonstrated that EEZJ was able to inhibit the carrageenan-induced paw oedema in rats to a significant degree (p ≤ 0.05) and the paw volume and thickness of both left and right paw were affected compared to the negative control group.EEZJ possesses antidiarrhoeal and antibacterial activity in a dose depending manner and may provide a pharmacological basis for its clinical use in diarrheal diseases. The activity may partially be due to the presence of  and quercetin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30178892>The protective effect of  on microvascular responsivity and protein expression in alzheimer disease induced by cerebral micro-injection of beta-amyloid and streptozotocin.</a></h1><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is mainly caused by accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) in vessels or parenchyma of the brain. Accordingly, natural compounds such as  (BA) might improve the AD signs by increase in blood flow and through reduction in amyloid plaques.Intra-hippocampal injection of BA (0.2 and 0.4 μmol/L /10 μL DMSO /rat) was done at intervals of 180 and 10 min before co-microinjection of 0.1 μmol/L Aβ dissolved in PBS (5 μL/rat, hippocampi) and 1.5 mg/kg Streptozotocin dissolved in aCSF (10 μL/rat, lateral ventricles). Cerebro-vascular responsivity tested by Laser Doppler, BBB leakage, Elisa assays of cytokines (TNF-α and IL-10), and Western blot analysis of proteins (BDNF and AchE) in the hippocampus were assessed 1 month after the injections.Microvascular reaction and BBB  were significantly impaired in AD rats, which were improved via BA pretreatment. BA could increase BDNF expression and decrease cytokine levels in the hippocampus of AD rats (especially 0.1 μmol/L Aβ: 0.4 μmol/L BA); however, no significant changes were detected in the blotting of AchE among the groups. could have a role in AD through protecting microcirculation, alleviating inflammation, and up-regulating BDNF expression which is clearer toward 1:4 molar ratios of Aβ to BA.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26232627>Methanol extracts of Xanthium sibiricum roots inhibit inflammatory responses via the inhibition of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in murine macrophages.</a></h1><p>Xanthium sibiricum has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of appendicitis, bronchitis, arthritis, and other inflammatory ailments. However, its pharmacological activity related to an anti-inflammatory effect remain unknown. This present study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of methanol extracts of X. sibiricum roots (MXS), and to further determine its underlying mechanism of action in order to assess the medicinal value of X. sibiricum roots.To assess the anti-inflammatory activity of MXS in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, the production of nitric oxide (NO) was measured using the Griess reagent system. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators were quantified using an Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Subsequently, immunoblotting analyses were employed to detect inflammatory mediators as well as to elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanisms suppressed by MXS.MXS inhibited LPS-stimulated NO production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages within the non-cytotoxic concentration range (50-400 μg/ml). In addition, mRNA and protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were significantly suppressed by MXS at the concentration of 400 μg/ml. Furthermore, MXS (200 μg/ml) clearly reduced the phosphorylation levels of the inhibitor of kappa Bα (IκBα) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), without affecting changes in the phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). When five major components (betulin, , β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and scopoletin) of MXS were separately investigated, stigmasterol and β-sitosterol seemed to play major inhibitory roles in the LPS-induced production of inflammatory mediators such as NO, IL-6, and TNF-α.Our results demonstrate that MXS has an anti-inflammatory property in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, and its anti-inflammatory activity is exerted by the regulation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and STAT3 signaling pathways.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of , a triterpenoid in sepsis-induced AKI using cecal ligation puncture (CLP) mouse model. Mice subjected to CLP developed histologic AKI at 18h after CLP. There was an increase in renal proinflammatory response (nuclear factor-kappa B expression, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10), matrix metalloproteinase-9, plasma creatinine, renal neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and oxidant stress response (malondialdehyde, inducible nitric oxide synthase, total nitrite and superoxide); decrease in anti-oxidant levels (superoxide dismutase and catalase) at 18h of CLP. However, BA pretreatment at the doses of 10 and 30mg/kg prevented the CLP-induced kidney damage by restoring the aforementioned inflammatory mediators, oxidant and anti-oxidant imbalance. These evidences suggest that, the protective effects of BA on kidney are associated with defending action against inflammatory and oxidative stress response in CLP mice and BA could be potential therapeutic agent in sepsis-induced AKI.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The mice received oral administration of EEDd (30-300mg/kg) in carrageenan models of , and EEDd (10-1000mg/kg) was assayed by the comet, micronucleus, and phagocytosis tests and by the peripheral leukocyte count.Phenols (204.04mg/g), flavonoids (89.17mg/g), and tannins (12.05mg/g) as well as sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, kaempferol 3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside,  and betulin were present in the EEDd. The value of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of EEDd was 62.5µg/mL. The EEDd induced a significant decrease in the edema, mechanical hypersensitivity and leukocyte migration induced by carrageenan. The comet and micronucleus tests indicated that the EEDd was not genotoxic. The EEDd also did not change the phagocytic activity or the leukocyte perLipheral count.The EEDd does not display genotoxicity, phagocytosis and could act as an antimycobacterial and anti-inflammatory agent.

Nicolson (Araceae), commonly called Suran or Jimmikand, has high medicinal value and is used ethnomedicinally for the treatment of different gastrointestinal and inflammatory disorders.The present study evaluated the effects of extracts of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius tubers on acetic acid-induced ulcerative  (UC) in rats.Wistar rats were orally administered methanol extract (APME) or aqueous extract (APAE) (250 and 500 mg/kg) or standard drug, prednisolone (PRDS) (4 mg/kg) for 7 days. On 6th day of treatment, UC was induced by transrectal instillation of 4% acetic acid (AA) and after 48 h  was assessed by measuring  parameters, biochemical estimations and histology of colon.APME or APAE pretreatment significantly (p < .05-.001) prevented AA-induced reduction in body weight and increase in  parameters viz. stool consistency, colon weight/length ratio and ulcer score, area and index. Extracts treatment attenuated (p < .001) increase in alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase in serum and myeloperoxidase activity and cytokines in colon tissue due to AA administration. Extracts treatment prevented AA-induced elevation in lipid peroxidation and decline in activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase and reduced-glutathione content (p < .05-.001) along with histopathological alterations. PRDS also showed similar ameliorative effect on .APME and APAE showed a preventive effect on UC, and ameliorated inflammation and oxidative damage in colon. The effects may be attributed to presence of phytochemicals, , β-sitosterol, and glucomannan. In conclusion, the tuber of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius exhibited an anticolitic effect through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant action.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27426509>Curative effect of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius tuber on experimental hemorrhoids in rats.</a></h1><p>Amorphophallus paeoniifolius (Dennst.) Nicolson (Family- Araceae) is a crop of south East Asian origin. In India, its tuber is widely used in ethnomedicinal practices by different tribes for the treatment of piles (hemorrhoids).The present study evaluated the effect of methanolic and aqueous extract of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius tuber on croton oil induced hemorrhoids in rats.The methanolic extract was standardized with the major phenolic compound, , by HPLC. The hemorrhoids were induced by applying 6% croton oil preparation in the ano-rectal region. Rats were orally administered methanolic and aqueous extract at doses of 250 and 500mg/kg, each for 7 days. Pilex (200mg/kg) was used as reference anti-hemorrhoidal drug. Hemorrhoids were assessed on eighth day by measuring hemorrhoidal and biochemical parameters along with histology of ano-rectal tissue.Croton oil application caused induction of hemorrhoids as indicated by significant (p<0.001) increase in plasma exudation of Evans blue in ano-rectal tissue, macroscopic severity score and ano-rectal coefficient as compared to normal rats. It significantly (p<0.001) elevated lactate dehydrogenase and cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) levels in serum and increased myeloperoxidase activity and lipid peroxidation in ano-rectal tissue along with marked histological damage as compared to normal rats. Treatment with tuber extracts and pilex significantly (p<0.05-p<0.001) ameliorated Evans blue exudation, hemorrhoidal parameters and other biochemical parameters with attenuation of tissue damage compared to hemorrhoid control rats. The results indicate that tuber extracts exhibited curative action on hemorrhoids. The aqueous extract showed more pronounced effect than methanolic extract. The effects may be attributed to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.Results indicate that tuber of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius exhibited curative action on hemorrhoids through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The study validates the ethnomedicinal use of tuber in hemorrhoids and implicates its therapeutic potential as an anti-hemorrhoidal agent.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This study aimed to investigate inhibition of acute and chronic inflammations and cytotoxic activity of extracts, fractions, and isolated compounds from L. ochrophylla.Hexane (HE) and ethanol (EE) extracts obtained from stem bark of L. ochrophylla were submitted to chromatographic fractionation. In order to test acute , experimental model of impact injury was used, followed by transdermal application of gels using phonophoresis. Histological analysis was based on scores assigned by the capacity of decreasing the lesion. To evaluate the effect EE and fractions on cell proliferation, human lymphocytes were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and analyzed using flow cytometry. Proliferation was measured using VPD 450 staining and the calculated proliferative index (PI). The cytotoxic activity was evaluated using MTT colorimetric method against MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, HCT-116, and Vero cells. GraphPad Prism Version 5 was used for statistical analysis.HE and EE provided friedelin, β-friedelinol, lupeol, mixture of lupeol and pseudotaraxasterol, β-sitosterol, , mixture of lupeol and taraxasterol, (-)-epicatechin, β-sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, and (+)-epicatechin-(4β-8)-epicatechin. HE, ethyl acetate fraction (AF), , and β-sitosterol promoted regeneration of muscle fibers caused by muscle injury. AF significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the lymphocyte proliferation index (1.36 for cultures stimulated with PHA, 0.7 for untreated cultures and 0.12 for cultures stimulated with PHA and treated with AF 25 μg/mL and AF 50 μg/mL, respectively). β-Sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside exhibited high cytotoxic activity (IC = 1.279 μg/mL) against HCT-116 cell line.These results suggest that extracts, fractions, and chemical constituents from L. ochrophylla decreases inflammatory processes generated by muscle injury. The anti-inflammatory activity may be justified by high inhibition of T cell proliferation. These extracts, fractions, and chemical constituents from L. ochrophylla may be useful as a therapeutic agent against rheumatic diseases. Moreover, chemical constituents from L. ochrophylla show potent cytotoxic activity against colon and rectal carcinomas.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27428455>Bioactivity-guided identification of antimicrobial metabolites in Alnus glutinosa bark and optimization of oregonin purification by Centrifugal Partition Chromatography.</a></h1><p>Barks from conifers and broadleaved trees constitute abundant wastes generated from wood harvesting and logging activities. Extracts of such residues obtained from Alnus trees have been reported as interesting resources with potent antibacterial activities. The present study aims to determine the antimicrobial activity of a crude methanol extract prepared from the bark of Alnus glutinosa against a panel of 22 bacteria and yeasts and to optimize a purification method enabling the high production of the most active substances. Fractionation of the crude extract was performed by Centrifugal Partition Chromatography (CPC) using a three-phase solvent system composed of n-heptane, methyl-ter-butyl ether, acetonitrile and water. The major known compounds contained in the fractions produced by CPC were chemically profiled by (13)C NMR dereplication, resulting in the unambiguous identification of oregonin, hirsutanonol, , and alusenone 1a. The antibacterial evaluation of the fractions by bioautography on Staphylococcus aureus revealed that oregonin, in addition to being the major metabolite of the crude extract (∼32% w/w), was the most active with an antibacterial inhibitory effect comparable to antibiotics. The purification of oregonin was optimized at the laboratory-scale by CPC. A single injection of 3.7g of crude extract resulted in a recovery of 72% (850mg) of the available oregonin at purity higher than 94%.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

While potent anti-HIV and antitumoral activities were attributed to BA, it is considered to have a moderate anti-inflammatory activity. Here we evaluated the effects of BA in a mouse model of endotoxic shock. Endotoxemia was induced through intraperitoneally LPS administration, nitric oxide (NO) and cytokines were assessed by Griess method and ELISA, respectively. Treatment of BALB/c mice with BA at 67 mg/kg caused a 100% survival against a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). BA treatment caused a reduction in TNF-α production induced by LPS but did not alter IL-6 production. Moreover, BA treatment increased significantly the serum levels of IL-10 compared to vehicle-treated, LPS-challenged mice. To investigate the role of IL-10 in BA-induced protection, wild-type and IL-10(-/-) mice were studied. In contrast to the observations in IL-10(+/+) mice, BA did not protect IL-10(-/-) mice against a lethal LPS challenge. Addition of BA inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by macrophages stimulated with LPS, while promoting a significant increase in IL-10 production. BA-treated peritoneal exudate macrophages produced lower concentrations of TNF-α and NO and higher concentrations of IL-10 upon LPS stimulation. Similarly, macrophages obtained from BA-treated mice produced less pro-inflammatory mediators and increased IL-10 when compared to non-stimulated macrophages obtained from vehicle-treated mice. In conclusion, we have shown that BA has a potent anti-inflammatory activity in vivo, protecting mice against LPS by modulating TNF-α production by macrophages in vivo through a mechanism dependent on IL-10.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Because L cells express the bile acid receptor TGR5 and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPPIV) rapidly degrades GLPs, we hypothesized that luminal TGR5 activation may attenuate intestinal injury via GLP-2 release, which is enhanced by DPPIV inhibition.Intestinal injury was induced in mice by administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water (free access to water containing 5% DSS for 7 days). The selective TGR5 agonist  (BTA) and the DPPIV inhibitor sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate (STG) were administered orally for 7 days. Male C57BL/6 mice (6-7 weeks old) were divided into five groups: normal control group, disease control group, BTA low group (drinking water containing 15 mg/L BTA), BTA high group (50 mg/L BTA), and BTA high + STG (3 mg/kg, i.g.) group.The selective TGR5 agonist BTA dose-dependently suppressed disease activity index and mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α in the colon. Nevertheless, STG administration had little additive effect on BTA-induced protection. Fibroblast activation protein mRNA expression, but not expression of other DPP family members, was increased in the colon of DSS-treated mice with increased mucosal DPPIV. Co-administration of the selective GLP-2 antagonist GLP-2 (3-33) reversed the effect of BTA.The selective TGR5 agonist BTA ameliorated DSS-induced colitis in mice via the GLP-2 pathway with no effect of DPPIV inhibition, suggesting that other DPP enzymatic activity is involved in GLP-2 degradation.© 2015 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27544002>Anti-inflammatory and associated analgesic activities of HPLC standardized alcoholic extract of known ayurvedic plant Schleichera oleosa.</a></h1><p>Schleichera oleosa (Lour.) Oken. commonly known as 'Koshamra' in Ayurveda is a tropical tree readily found in Asia and is used to treat pain and rheumatism, as traditional medicine in different parts of India. However, scientific evidences to justify these claims are lacking. Considering the traditional use of S.oleosa and the lack of information about its pharmacological properties, we investigated the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect of the alcoholic extract of S.oleosa (SE) against different animal models in rodents.The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated against carrageenan induced paw edema and TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) induced ear edema. To assess the mechanism of anti-inflammatory action the extract was tested against different phlogistic agents like histamine, serotonin, bradykinin and, prostaglandin E2. The analgesic activity was assessed against formalin induced pain.The ethanolic extract of S. oleosa bark, did not exhibited any signs of toxicity up to a dose of 2000mg/kg. The extract significantly inhibited increase in paw edema and ear edema. A percent reduction of 60.84% was found against carrageenan induced paw edema by 400mg/kg dose of SE. The extract was effective against edema induced by serotonin, histamine and PGE. In formalin test the extract inhibited both the neurogenic 1st and mainly the inflammatory 2nd phase. Significant reduction in tissue levels of inflammatory mediators was also observed (p<0.05 for NO and p<0.01 for MDA). The extract showed presence of potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory compounds lupeol, lupeol acetate, betulin and  on HPLC analysis which can be held responsible for its studied biological activity.The results suggest that SE is effective in inflammatory processes and targets multiple mediators of inflammation. Its action is markedly influenced by the inhibition of neutrophil migration, anti-oxidant action and reduction in inflamed tissue.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Thus, we aimed to prepare novel 50:50 poly(lactic--glycolic acid) (PLGA)-loaded B nanoparticles (BNP) and to compare its anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) activity with parent B.BNP were synthesized and characterized using different methods such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry and particle size analyses. Particle size of BNP was optimized through the application of the stabilizer, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The anti-HCC response was evaluated through in vitro cell line study using Hep-G2 cells, confocal microscopy, in vivo oral pharmacokinetics and animal studies. Further, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis was conducted to observe the changes in the expression of specific genes.Particle size of BNP was optimized through the application of the stabilizer, polyvinyl alcohol. Physicochemical characterization exhibited particle size of 257.1 nm with zeta potential -0.170 mV (optimized batch B, BNP). SEM and FTIR analyses of BNP showed that cylindrical particles of B converted to spherical particles in BNP and there were no interaction between B and used polymers. The release study of optimized BNP was highest (≥80%) than any other formulation. Later, in vitro cell culture analysis using Hep-G2 cells and confocal microscopy studies revealed that BNP had the highest inhibition and penetration properties than parent B. Oral pharmacokinetics studies using albino Wistar rats at single 100 mg dose again exhibited BNP had the higher 50% of plasma concentration (t), a higher maximum plasma concentration () and took longer to reach the maximum plasma concentration (T) than parent B. Next, our in vivo study using nitrosodiethyl amine (NDEA)-induced HCC model documented BNP decreased in number of nodules, restored body weight, oxidative stress parameters, liver marker enzymes and histological architecture than parent B. Lastly, qRT-PCR studies further demonstrated that anti-HCC properties of BNP may be due to over expression of antiapoptotic caspases i.e., caspase 3 and 8.The prepared BNP showed a better therapeutic response against HCC and could be attributed as future candidate molecule for HCC treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25291962> negates oxidative lung injury in surgical sepsis model.</a></h1><p>Sepsis commonly progresses to acute lung injury and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Septic acute lung injury is characterized by severe oxidative stress response, remained refractory to present therapies, and new therapies need to be developed to improve further clinical outcomes. We determined the effect of  (BA) on oxidative lung injury in mice using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model.Five groups of mice (six in each group) received three pretreatments at 24-h interval before surgery. Surgery was done 1 h after last dosing. Sham and CLP control group mice received vehicle. BA was administered to other three groups of mice at 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg dose. Lung and plasma samples were collected for analysis by sacrificing the mice at 18 h of surgery.Compared with sham, CLP significantly increased total protein, nitrite, malondialdehyde, isoprostane, superoxide, protein carbonyl, oxidative stress index, inducible nitric oxide synthase protein, and histopathologic changes and reduced the superoxide dismutase, catalase activity, and total thiol levels in lungs and plasma, which were restored by BA pretreatment.BA pretreatment decreased the levels of oxidants, increased the levels of antioxidants in lungs and plasma thereby reducing the oxidative lung injury in CLP mice. Additionally, BA was found to scavenge the superoxide and nitric oxide radical in vitro.

However, the pathogenesis of NAFLD remains to be elucidated, and no established therapeutic regimens for treating NAFLD exist. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the main cellular energy sensor, has been implicated as a key regulator of hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism. Recently, emerging evidence indicates that many plant-derived natural products are capable of ameliorating NAFLD by targeting AMPK.The published literature in PubMed relating to this topic was searched through June 2016.Significant advances have been made with respect to understanding the protective effects of plant-derived natural products against NAFLD. A variety of natural products, including alkaloids (berberine, demethyleneberberine, nicotine, caffeine, etc.), polyphenols (resveratrol, puerarin, curcumin, caffeic acid, etc.) and other compounds (β- caryophyllene, gastrodin, compound K, , etc.), have demonstrated promising results in preclinical studies. Mechanistic studies of these compounds have focused on their activation of AMPK and its downstream effectors involved in lipid metabolism.The findings of this review confirm that plant-derived natural products capable of activating the AMPK signaling pathway are potential therapeutic agents for NAFLD.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545273>Anti-inflammatory effect and potential mechanism of  on λ-carrageenan-induced paw edema in mice.</a></h1><p>λ-Carrageenan (Carr), a seaweed polysaccharide, is used as a proinflammatory agent in research.

BA pretreatment significantly reduced the inflammatory response to Carr-induced paw edema, especially at 4 h after injection. BA reduced the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-5, IL-6, GM-CSF, KC, MCP-1 and PGE in Carr-treated mice, and increased those of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12. It also increased SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities, and GSH content, and reduced MDA content in the liver of Carr-treated mice. Besides, BA reduced neutrophil infiltration in the basal and subcutaneous layers of the paw of Carr-treated mice, decreased the expression of COX-2 protein, and reduced the phosphorylation of JNK, p38 and ERK1/2. These results indicated that the protective effect of BA on Carr-induced paw edema might be due to its alleviation of inflammatory response and inhibition of oxidative stress, possibly by inhibiting MAPK-COX-2-PGE signaling pathway activation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, coussaric acid (CA) and  (BA), both triterpenoid compounds, were obtained from D. kaki leaf extracts through bioassay-guided isolation. CA and BA showed anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, providing important information on their anti-inflammatory mechanism. Furthermore, they markedly inhibited nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages, and suppressed tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels. Furthermore, they decreased protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2. Pre-treatment with CA and BA inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB. We further examined the effects of CA and BA on heme oxygenase (HO)-1 expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages: BA induced HO-1 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner, while CA had no effect. We also investigated whether BA treatment induced nuclear translocation of Nrf2. BA inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB-binding activity, as well as pro-inflammatory mediator and cytokine production (e.g., NO, PGE₂, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6), by partial reversal of this effect by SnPP, an inhibitor of HO-1. These findings further elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of CA and BA isolated from D. kaki.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27951742>Healing effect of Dillenia indica fruit extracts standardized to  on ultraviolet radiation-induced -like wounds in rats.</a></h1><p>Dillenia indica Linn.

Effects against lipid peroxidation were assessed in vitro. Wounds were created at rat tails (n = 12). Topical treatments were applied once daily for 7 days (1 mL of AEE or EAE at 5 or 50 mg/mL). Maximal dose was defined by the extract solubility. A 10-fold lower dose was also tested. Positive and negative controls were treated with clobetasol (0.5 mg/mL) or excipient. Half of each group was euthanized for histology. The remaining animals were observed for 20 days for wound measurements.Yields of AEE and EAE were 4.3 and 0.7%, respectively.  concentrations in AEE and EAE were 4.6 and 107.6 mg/g. Extracts neutralized lipid peroxidation in vitro at 0.02 μg/mL, accelerating healing at 50 mg/mL. Complete healing in mice treated with AEE occurred 16 days after wound induction. This time was 14 and 12 days in mice treated with EAE and clobetasol. Compared to orthokeratosis, parakeratosis was reduced by AEE (25%), EAE (45%) and clobetasol (55%). EAE caused superior protection against biomolecules oxidation of skin compared to AEE.EAE exhibited activity closer to that of clobetasol.  may be an active constituent, which should be assessed in future studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653753>The phytochemical and anti-inflammatory studies of Dillenia suffruticosa leaves.</a></h1><p>The Dillenia suffruticosa leaves (Dilleniaceae), a folk medicine recommended in Southeast Asia for treating , were phytochemically studied for the first time and assessed for suppression of λ-carrageenan-induced paw oedema in rats.

In this study, we investigated the anti-osteoarthritic effects of BA in IL-1β-stimulated human osteoarthritis chondrocytes. Human osteoarthritis chondrocytes were pre-incubated with BA (6, 12, 24μM) for 12h and then treated with IL-1β (10ng/ml). The production of PGE2 and NO were detected by ELISA and Griess reagent. The expression of NF-κB, IκB, and PPAR-γ were detected by Western blotting. The results showed that BA dose-dependently inhibited IL-1β-induced MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, PGE2 and NO productions. BA also inhibited IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation. Furthermore, BA was found to activate PPAR-γ and the inhibition of PGE2 and NO by BA can be reversed by PPAR-γ antagonist GW9662. In conclusion, these results suggested that BA inhibited IL-1β-induced  in osteoarthritis chondrocytes by activating PPAR-γ.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

So the present study emphasizes combinatorial effect of , a triterpenoid and fluvastatin, an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor on atherogenesis during arthritis. Arthritis was induced by bovine type II collagen dissolved in 0.01M acetic acid at a concentration of 4mg/mL and emulsified in equal volume of incomplete Freund's adjuvant.  (2mg/kg) and fluvastatin (5mg/kg) alone and in combination was administered orally from day 14 to 60. At the end of 60days, tissues and blood were isolated for evaluation of biochemical parameters. Treatment with  and fluvastatin showed significant (p<0.05) reduction in Arthritic index, Rheumatoid factor, C-reactive protein (CRP), total lipids and anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) antibody. Anti-inflammatory enzyme activities and oxidative stress were significantly decreased in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells by the administration of both  and fluvastatin than alone treatments. Combination therapy was found to be a potential enhancer of the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 whereas it significantly blocked the expression of Toll-like receptors-2 and 4, inflammatory markers such as interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, Interferon-γ, cell adhesion molecules and nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B in aorta than drug alone treated groups.

(BA), a pentacyclic triterpene, has been reported to have a variety of biological effects, including anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. This study was designed to determine whether BA could prevent atherosclerosis in diabetic apolipoprotein-E gene knockout (ApoE KO) mice. The mice were treated with BA for 12 weeks to examine its beneficial effects on atherosclerosis in ApoE KO mice. Male ApoE KO mice and age-matched control group mice (C57BL/6Jms) were used as experimental systems and their systolic blood pressure, insulin resistance, and vascular inflammation were measured. BA-treated ApoE KO mice showed lowered systolic blood pressure. The metabolic parameter showed that BA decreased blood urea nitrogen, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels. Blood glucose, insulin, glucose tolerance results, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index were found to be better in BA-treated ApoE KO mice than untreated ApoE KO mice. Consistent with the change in lipid profiles, oil red O and H&E staining revealed that treatment with BA reduced atherosclerotic lesions such as roughened endothelial layers. BA ameliorated the reduction of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, leading to the inhibition of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and endothelin 1 (ET-1) expression. These results suggest that BA may be useful in the treatment and prevention of early atherosclerosis via the attenuation of endothelial dysfunction in diabetic ApoE KO mice.Copyright © 2017.

Expression of the neurosteroid/bile acid receptor Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) has been demonstrated in the brain and is thought to be neuroprotective. However, it is unknown how TGR5 signaling can influence the progression and associated neuroinflammation of HE. HE was induced in C57Bl/6 mice via intraperitoneal injection of azoxymethane (AOM) and tissue was collected throughout disease progression. TGR5 expression was elevated in the frontal cortex following AOM injection in mice. The cellular localization of TGR5 was found in both neurons and microglia in the cortex of C57Bl/6 mice. Central infusion of the TGR5 agonist, , prior to AOM injection delayed neurological decline, increased cortical cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentrations, reduced microglia activation and proliferation, and reduced proinflammatory cytokine production.  treatment in vitro reduced the neuronal expression of chemokine ligand 2, a chemokine previously demonstrated to contribute to HE pathogenesis. Lastly, treatment of the microglia cell line EOC-20 with conditioned media from -treated primary neurons decreased phagocytic activity and cytokine production. Together, these data identify that activation of TGR5, which is up-regulated during HE, alleviates neuroinflammation and improves outcomes of AOM-treated mice through neuron and microglia paracrine signaling.© 2015 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28502905>Inhibition of proinflammatory mediators by coumaroyl lupendioic acid, a new lupane-type triterpene from Careya arborea, on -induced animal model.</a></h1><p>Careya arborea Roxb.

C. arborea is traditionally used in tumors, , anthelmintic, bronchitis, epileptic fits, astringents, antidote to snake-venom, skin disease, diarrhea, dysentery with bloody stools, dyspepsia, ulcer, tooth ache, and ear pain.In our previous work, the methanolic extract of Careya arborea stem bark showed significant anti-inflammatory activity. As a continuity of that work, this study aimed at the isolation and evaluation of the anti-inflammatory effect of coumaroyl lupendioic acid, a new lupane-type triterpene from Careya arborea stem bark. Further, to give an insight into the underlying mechanism of action of the compound on the modulation of proinflammatory mediators.Methanolic extract of Careya arborea stem bark was suspended in water, and sequentially fractionated with n-hexane and ethyl acetate. Further ethyl acetate fraction was subjected to medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) to isolate the active molecules. The isolated compounds were characterized by the various spectral techniques namely UV, IR, H NMR, C NMR, DEPT, H-H COSY, HMBC and Mass spectral techniques. In vitro COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme inhibition assays using human whole blood was performed to investigate the inhibitory effect of the isolated compounds. The resulted potent COX-2 inhibitor of the isolated constituents compound 5, designated as coumaroyl lupendioic acid (CLA), was investigated in carrageenan induced  and its effect was also compared with  (BA) at the doses of 10 and 20mgkg, p.o. using indomethacin and celecoxib (10 and 20mgkg, p.o., respectively) as reference drugs. The effect of CLA on the production of NO, MPO, PGE2, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were assessed. In addition, the histopathology and immunohistochemistry (NF-ҡB, COX-2 and TNF-α protein expression) in paw tissues were also carried out.The chromatographic fractionation of the methanolic extract resulted in isolation of six new derivatives of lupane type triterpenes for the first time from the stem bark of C. arborea; 3β-hydroxy-lup-5,20 (29),21-trien-28-oic acid (Compound 1), 1, 3, 13, 16-tetrahydroxy-lup-9(11), 20(29)-diene-28-oic acid (Compound 2), 1, 7-di hydroxy  (Compound 3), 3β-O-dihydrocinnamyl  (Compound 4), 3β-O-trans-coumaryl-lup-6, 9(11), 20(29)-triene-27, 28-dioic acid (Compound 5), 16β-hydroxy-2, 3-seco-lup-5, 20(29)-dien-2, 3, 28-trioic acid (Compound 6). Among the all isolated compounds 3β-O-trans-coumaryl-lup-6, 9(11), 20(29)-triene-27, 28-olioic acid designated as coumaroyl lupendioic acid (CLA) showed higher COX-2 selectivity which is comparable to reference drug (celecoxib). CLA significantly reduced carrageenan induced  whereas CLA revealed greater effect as compared to BA at the similar corresponding doses. Moreover, CLA significantly inhibited pro-inflammatory mediators elevated by carrageenan. CLA also preserved the tissue architecture as evidenced by the histopathology. Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies revealed that CLA significantly down regulated NF-ҡB, COX-2 and TNF-α protein expression.The study gives an insight into the molecular mechanisms of coumaroyl lupendioic acid and suggests that the down-regulations of proinflammatory mediators provide credence to the ethno botanical use of the plant in the management of .Copyright © 2017.

(BA) was reported to reduce visceral pain owing to its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory potential. Here, we -explored whether BA can attenuate RIH through inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation in spinal dorsal horn. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: Control, Incision, RIH, and RIH pre-treated with BA. After pretreated with BA (25 mg/kg, i.g.) for 7 days, rats were subcutaneously infused with remifentanil (40 μg/kg) for 30 min during right plantar incision surgery to induce RIH. The paw withdrawal mechanical threshold (PWMT), paw withdrawal thermal latency (PWTL), spinal oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators were determined. Intraoperative remifentanil infusion induced postoperative hyperalgesia, as evidenced by the significant decrease in PWMT and PWTL (p < 0.01), and the significant increase in oxidative stress and inflammation evidenced by up-regulations of malondialdehyde, 3-nitrotyrosine, interleukin-1β and tumour necrosis factor-α (p < 0.01) in spinal dorsal horn and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity (p < 0.01) in dorsal root ganglion, as well as a decrease in manganese superoxide -dismutase activity (p < 0.01) compared with control and -incision groups. All these results mentioned above were markedly reversed by pre-treatment with BA (p < 0.01) compared with RIH group. These findings demonstrated that BA can effectively attenuate RIH, which associates with potentially inhibiting oxidative stress and subsequently down-regulating MMP-9-related pro-inflammatory cyokines in spinal dorsal horn.© 2018 S.

In the present study, the inflammatory gene expression and the anti-inflammatory properties of betulin, , and 16 semisynthetic betulin derivatives were investigated. Betulin derivatives 3, 4, and 5 selectively inhibited the expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in a post-transcriptional manner.

However, the effect of BA on DN has not been fully elucidated. To explore the possible anti-inflammatory effects of BA and their underlying mechanisms, we used streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat kidneys and high glucose-treated glomerular mesangial cells. Our study showed BA could inhibit the degradation of IκBα and the activity of NF-κB in diabetic rat kidneys and high glucose-induced mesangial cells, resulting in reduction of FN expression. In addition, BA suppressed the DNA binding activity and transcriptional activity of NF-κB in high glucose-induced glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs). Furthermore, BA enhanced the interaction between IκBα and β-arrestin2 in mesangial cells.

BA can regulate immunity with anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, it's unknown whether BA has a therapeutic effect on . The objectives of this study were to investigate whether BA attenuates psoriatic skin inflammation and to identify its mechanisms of action. A murine model of imiquimod-induced  was utilized to evaluate skin lesion while flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses were performed for immunoassays. We found that BA treatment alleviated psoriatic symptoms and inflammatory skin lesion. BA lowered the PASI scores, decreased epidermal thickness and reduced T cell infiltration in the skin lesion. Moreover, BA reduced the frequency of IL-17A-expressing CD4 and γδ T cells in psoriatic mice, but did not alter CD4FoxP3 Treg frequency. BA also reduced IL-17A production but increased anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 level in serum of the psoriatic mice. Furthermore, BA inhibited gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in skin lesions, including RORγt, IL-17A, IL-6 and TNFα. Importantly, it suppressed NFκB signaling in the skin lesion. Finally, BA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-17A production by CD4 T-Cells in vitro. Thus, BA attenuates  and inhibits Th17 development.Copyright © 2019.

While less well characterized compared to its hydrophilic derivative, , it exhibits potent anticancer activity described in many publications. Indeed, underinvestigated are its immunomodulatory functions in inflammatory diseases that appeared to enhance innate immune cell activities in an adjuvant-like fashion towards an interleukin-12 driven antitumor immunity. Herein, we like to emphasize the simultaneous and dual function of betulin on the basis of recent investigations of the tumor microenvironment and enlighten the potential use of betulin in the control of inflammation-associated carcinogenesis.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26057191>Erythroivorensin: A novel anti-inflammatory diterpene from the root-bark of Erythrophleum ivorense (A Chev.).</a></h1><p>The stem- and root-bark of Erythrophleum ivorense (A Chev., family, Fabaceae) are routinely employed in the West African traditional medicine to treat  and a variety of other disease conditions. Although the chemistry and pharmacology of cassaine-type diterpene alkaloids isolated from the stem-bark of the plant are fairly established, the root-bark has not yet been investigated. In the present study, the crude aqueous-alcohol extract of the root-bark was demonstrated to display a time- and dose (30-300 mg/kg p.o.)-dependent anti-inflammatory effect in chicks. Comprehensive chromatographic analysis coupled with spectroscopic and X-ray study further allowed the assignment of one of the major anti-inflammatory constituents as a novel cassaine-type diterpene, erythroivorensin. The other major constituents were known anti-inflammatory compounds: a triterpene,  and a flavonoid, eriodictyol. The dose (10-100mg/kg p.o.)-dependent anti-inflammatory effects of the three compounds were either comparable or more significant than the positive control, diclofenac.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

(BA), a natural pentacyclic triterpenoid, has been reported to be involved in anti-, in particular having an inhibitory effect on proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 17 (IL-17) and interferon- (IFN-) production. In this study, we screened BA derivatives and found a BA derivative, SH479, that had a greater inhibitory effect on T17 differentiation. Our further analysis showed that SH479 had a greater inhibitory effect on T17 and T1, and a more stimulatory effect on regulatory T (Treg) cells. To evaluate the effects of SH479 on autoimmune diseases in vivo, we employed the extensively used MS mouse model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our results showed that SH479 ameliorated clinical and histologic signs of EAE in both prevention and therapeutic protocols by regulating the T17/Treg balance. SH479 dose-dependently reduced splenic lymphocyte proinflammatory factors and increased anti-inflammatory factors. Moreover, SH479 specifically inhibited splenic lymphocyte viability from EAE mice but not normal splenic lymphocyte viability. At the molecular level, SH479 inhibited T17 differentiation by regulating signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) phosphorylation, DNA binding activity, and recruitment to the  promoter in CD4 T cells. Furthermore, SH479 promoted the STAT5 signaling pathway and inhibited the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) signaling pathway. Together, our data demonstrated that SH479 ameliorated EAE by regulating the T17/Treg balance through inhibiting the STAT3 and NF-B pathways while activating the STAT5 pathway, suggesting that SH479 is a potential novel drug candidate for autoimmune diseases including MS.Copyright © 2017 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30070357>Actinic keratosis - review for clinical practice.</a></h1><p>Actinic keratosis (AK) is a lesion that arises as a result of excessive exposure to solar radiation and appearing predominantly on Fitzpatrick phototype I and II skin. Given that some AKs evolve into squamous cell carcinoma, these lesions are considered premalignant in nature, occurring mostly in elderly men and immunosuppressed individuals chronically exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. There are several mechanisms for the formation of AKs; among them are oxidative stress, immunosuppression, , altered proliferation and dysregulation of cell growth, impaired apoptosis, mutagenesis, and human papillomavirus (HPV). Through the understanding of these mechanisms, several treatments have emerged. Among the options for AK treatment, the most commonly used include 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cryotherapy, diclofenac, photodynamic therapy (PDT), imiquimod (IQ), retinoids, and ingenol mebutate (IM). There have been recent advances in the treatment options that have seen the emergent use of newer agents such as resiquimod, , piroxicam, and dobesilate. The combination between therapies has presented relevant results with intention to reduce duration of therapy and side effects. All AK cases must be treated because of their propensity to transform into malignancy and further complicate treatment. In addition to medical or surgical care, education about sun exposure prevention remains the best and most cost-effective method for AK prevention. The objective of this article is to conduct a literature review of the clinical presentation of AK including advances in treatment options available.© 2018 The International Society of Dermatology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27965071>A  derivative SH479 inhibits collagen-induced arthritis by modulating T cell differentiation and cytokine balance.</a></h1><p>The ideal therapeutic drug for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) should not only inhibit , but also prevent articular joint damage and particularly inhibit osteoclastogenesis.  (BA) is a natural pentacyclic triterpene that has displayed moderate anti-inflammatory and anti-osteoclastogenesis activities in various experimental systems, suggesting that BA or its derivatives could have an inhibitory effect on RA. In this study, we screened BA derivatives and found a heterocyclic ring-fused BA derivative, SH479, which had greater inhibitory effect than BA on Th17 differentiation. Moreover, we investigated the immune regulatory activity and potential therapeutic effects of SH479 in an experimental model of rheumatoid arthritis, the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. SH479 significantly inhibited Th1 and Th17 polarization, antigen-specific T cell proliferation and splenic lymphocyte-induced osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, it diminished arthritis scores as well as bone destruction and cartilage depletion in the CIA mouse model. The protective effect of SH479 was accompanied by decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IFN-γ, together with enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokine expression including IL-10 and IL-4, as well as elevated CD4 Foxp3 cell number. At the molecular level, our results indicated that SH479 alleviated CIA through regulation of CD4 T cell subtypes by JAK-STAT pathways. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that SH479 has therapeutic potential for rheumatoid arthritis through an anti-inflammatory effect by shifting a pathogenic Th17/Th1 response to a Th2/Treg phenotype, and also through an additional articular bone protection effect.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In our study, we used current biomedical approaches to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of BXD and possible protective mechanism involved in inhibiting dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic ulcerative colitis model.Chronic DSS colitis was induced in C57BL/6 male mice by three cycles of 5 days of 2% DSS in drinking water, alternating with 5 days of normal water, totaling 30 days. In BXD group, the mice were administered at a dose of 8.7g/kg BXD for 5 days before and during DSS treatment via oral gavage per day. Mice in vehicle group and DSS group were given orally the same volume of drinking water, instead. Body weight, stool characters and hematochezia were observed everyday. The colorectal tissues were used to detect levels of TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10, IL-1β, IL-17, IL-23 and MPO by ELISA or qRT-PCR. The expression of COX-2, 8-Oxoguanine and Nrf2 were examined by IHC, and p-p65 was examined by western blotting. ThOD and the content of MDA were measured according to kits respectively.BXD significantly protected against DSS-induced chronic ulcerative colitis by amelioration of body weight loss, DAI and histology score. The level of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-17, IL-23, COX-2 and p-p65 were decreased significantly, while the level of IL-10 improved with the treatment of BXD. MDA, MPO and 8-Oxoguanine were decreased, meanwhile SOD activity and Nrf2 expression were elevated significantly by BXD.BXD possesses the potential of anti- and anti-oxidation to treat colitis. The protective mechanism of BXD may involve in inhibition of NF-κBp65 activation and increasement of Nrf2 expression in colorectums of mice.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the potential contributors eliminating pain associated with gingival  are unknown. Results we examined the involvement of CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) on the mechanical sensitivity of inflamed periodontal tissue, using a mouse model of periodontitis established by the ligation of the tooth cervix of a maxillary second molar and inoculation with Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis). Infiltration of inflammatory cells into gingival tissue was not observed following the inoculation. Under light anesthesia, the mechanical head withdrawal threshold (MHWT) on the buccal gingiva was measured using an electronic von Frey anesthesiometer. No significant changes in MHWT were observed in the mice with P. gingivalis-induced periodontitis during the experimental period. Continuous administration of CXCR4 neutralizing antibody to the gingival tissue significantly decreased MHWT and increased the number of gingival CXCR4 immunoreactive macrophages in the periodontitis group. Nitric oxide metabolites in the gingival tissue were significantly increased after the inoculation of P. gingivalis and were reduced by gingival CXCR4 neutralization. Gingival L-arginine administration induced gingival mechanical allodynia in naive animals. Moreover, the decrease in MHWT after treatment with P. gingivalis and CXCR4 neutralization was partially reversed by nitric oxide synthase inhibition in the gingival tissue. Nuclear factor-kappa B was expressed in infiltrating macrophages after inoculation of P. gingivalis and administration of the nuclear factor-kappa B activator  induced gingival mechanical allodynia in naive mice. Conclusions These findings suggest that CXCR4 signaling inhibits nitric oxide release from infiltrating macrophages and is involved in modulation of the mechanical sensitivity in the periodontal tissue in P. gingivalis-induced periodontitis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25418122>Activation of the bile acid receptor TGR5 enhances LPS-induced inflammatory responses in a human monocytic cell line.</a></h1><p>Bile acids are recognized as signaling molecules, mediating their effects both through the cell surface receptor TGR5 and the nuclear receptor FXR. After a meal, approximately 95% of the bile acids are transported from terminal ileum and back to the liver via the portal vein, resulting in postprandial elevations of bile acids in blood. During the digestion of fat, components from the microbiota, including LPS, are thought to reach the circulation where it may lead to inflammatory responses after binding TLR4 immune cells. Both LPS and bile acids are present in blood after a high-fat meal; we therefore wanted to study consequences of a possible interplay between TGR5 and TLR4 in human monocytes.The monocytic cell line U937 stably transfected with the NF-κB reporter plasmid 3x-κB-luc was used as a model system to study the effects of TGR5 and TLR4. Activation of MAP kinases was studied to reveal functional consequences of triggering TGR5 in U937 cells. Effects of TGR5 and TLR4 activation were monitored using NF-κB luciferase assay and by quantification of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 using ELISA.In this study, results show that triggering TGR5 with the specific agonist  (BA), and the bile acids CDCA or DCA, activated both the main MAP kinases ERK1/2, p38 and JNK, and the NF-κB signaling pathway. We further demonstrated that co-triggering of TLR4 and TGR5 enhanced the activation of NF-κB and the release of inflammatory cytokines in a synergistic manner compared to triggering of TLR4 alone.Thus, two different and simultaneous events associated with the digestive process coordinately affect the function of human monocytes and contribute to enhanced . Because elevated levels of circulatory LPS may contribute to the development of insulin resistance, the results from this study suggest that bile acids through the activation of TGR5 may have a role in the development of insulin resistance as well.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28899698> derivative BA5, a dual NF-kB/calcineurin inhibitor, alleviates experimental shock and delayed hypersensitivity.</a></h1><p> (BA) is a naturally occurring triterpenoid with several biological properties already described, including immunomodulatory activity. Here we investigated the immunomodulatory activity of eight semi-synthetic amide derivatives of . Screening of derivatives BA1-BA8 led to the identification of compounds with superior immunomodulatory activity than BA on activated macrophages and lymphocytes. BA5, the most potent derivative, inhibited nitric oxide and TNFα production in a concentration-dependent manner, and decreased NF-κB activation in Raw 264.7 cells. Additionally, BA5 inhibited the proliferation of activated lymphocytes and the secretion of IL-2, IL-4 IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A and IFNɣ, in a concentration-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis in lymphocyte cultures showed that treatment with BA5 induces cell cycle arrest in pre-G1 phase followed by cell death by apoptosis. Moreover, BA5 also inhibited the activity of calcineurin, an enzyme that plays a critical role in the progression of cell cycle and T lymphocyte activation. BA5 has a synergistic inhibitory effect with dexamethasone on lymphoproliferation, showing a promising profile for drug combination. Finally, we observed immunosuppressive effects of BA5 in vivo in mouse models of lethal endotoxemia and delayed type hypersensitivity.

Here we investigated the effects of BA5, an amide semi-synthetic derivative , in a model of CCC. Mice chronically infected with  were treated orally with BA5 (10 or 1 mg/Kg), three times per week, for 2 months. BA5 treatment decreased  and fibrosis in heart sections but did not improve exercise capacity or ameliorate cardiac electric disturbances in infected mice. Serum concentrations of TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-1β, as well as cardiac gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, were reduced after BA5 treatment. In contrast, a significant increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 concentration was observed in BA5-treated mice in both tested doses compared to vehicle-treated mice. Moreover, polarization to anti-inflammatory/M2 macrophage phenotype was evidenced by a decrease in the expression of NOS2 and proinflammatory cytokines and the increase in M2 markers, such as Arg1 and CHI3 in mice treated with BA5.

This study was conducted to evaluate the potency of self-assembled  (SA-BA) against DOX induced chemotherapeutic toxicity in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). The isolated  from the bark of Ziziphus jujuba tree was purified by column chromatography and characterized by FT-IR, XRD, (1)H NMR and self-assembly property was investigated by SEM imaging. DOX treatment produced significant reduction of viability of PBLs mainly by lowering cellular anti-oxidant pool and elevating the reactive oxygen species level. Pre-treatment with SA-BA followed by DOX exposure for 24h protected the PBLs from DOX induced oxidative stress. Potent anti-apoptotic role of SA-BA was also confirmed by FACS analysis and western blot assay. Severe  is one of the major concerns in DOX treatment. We found that pre-treatment with SA-BA on PBLs significantly protected the PBLs from DOX induced .

Several phytochemical-derived anticancer drugs including curcumin, , phenethylisothiocyanate and celastrol, and many others induce reactive oxygen species, and their effects on gene regulation show some overlap in various cancer cell lines. We hypothesize that reactive oxygen species-inducing anticancer agents and many other natural products target a common pathway in cancer cells, which initially involves downregulation of specificity protein 1 (Sp1), Sp3, and Sp4, which are highly expressed in tumors/cell lines derived from solid tumors. This hypothesis is supported by several published reports showing that a large number of phytochemical-derived anticancer agents downregulate Sp1, Sp3, Sp4, and pro-oncogenic Sp-regulated genes involved in cell growth (cyclin D1 and growth factor receptors), survival (bcl-2 and survivin), angiogenesis and migration (MMP-9, vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptors), and inflammation (NF-kB). The contribution of this pathway to the anticancer activity of drugs such as curcumin, celastrol, , and phenethylisothiocyanate must be determined in order to optimize clinical applications of drug combinations containing these compounds.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29243291>Antiinflammatory properties of  and xylopic acid in the carrageenan-induced pleurisy model of lung  in mice.</a></h1><p>This study investigated the antiinflammatory properties of  (BA) and xylopic acid (XA) extracted from Margaritaria discoidea and Xylopia aethiopica, respectively. M. discoidea and X. aethiopica are plants native in Ghana and the West-African region and used traditionally to treat different pathologies including inflammatory conditions. The antiinflammatory effect of BA and XA was established by an in vivo assay using the carrageenan-induced pleural  model in mice. Also, the ability of BA and XA to increase catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione levels and decrease lipid peroxidation level in reactive oxidative assays was assessed. In addition, the ability of XA and BA to prevent potential lung tissue damage was quantified.
