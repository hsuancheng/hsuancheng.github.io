Here, we evaluated target-specific fluorescence-mediated tomography (FMT) for visualization of neutrophil infiltration in murine experimental DSS-induced .  was assessed using clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological parameters. Intestinal neutrophil infiltration was determined at day 0, 4, and 10 by targeted FMT after injection of a neutrophil-specific fluorescence-labelled monoclonal antibody (Gr-1). Complementary, immunofluorescence tissue sections with Gr-1 and ELISA-based assessment of tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) served as the gold standard for the quantification of neutrophil infiltration. Colitic animals showed decreasing body weight, presence of fecal occult blood, and endoscopic signs of inflammation. FMT revealed a significantly increased level of fluorescence only four days after  induction as compared to pre-experimental conditions (pmol tracer 73.2 ± 18.1 versus 738.6 ± 80.7;  < 0.05), while neither body weight nor endoscopic assessment showed significant changes at this early time. Confirmatory, post-mortem immunofluorescence studies and measurements of tissue MPO confirmed the presence of increased neutrophil infiltration in colitic mice compared to controls. Concluding, Gr-1 targeted FMT can detect early colonic infiltration of neutrophils in experimental  even before clinical symptoms or endoscopic alterations occur. Therefore, FMT might be an important tool for repetitive and non-invasive monitoring of inflammatory cell infiltrate in intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657484>Mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan-induced B10 cells decrease severity of dextran sodium sulfate-induced inflammatory bowel disease in mice.</a></h2><p>IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) is a chronic, non-specific, inflammatory gastrointestinal disease that mainly consists of Crohn's disease and ulcerative . However, the etiology and pathogenesis of IBD are still unclear. B10 (IL-10 producing regulatory ) cells, a subset of regulatory  cells, are known to contribute to intestinal homeostasis and the aberrant frequency of B10 cells is associated with IBD. We have recently reported that B10 cells can be induced by ManLAM (mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan), a major cell-wall lipoglycan of M.tb (Mycobacterium tuberculosis). In the current study, the ManLAM-induced B10 cells were adoptively transferred into IL(interleukin)-10 mice and the roles of ManLAM-induced B10 cells were investigated in DSS (dextran sodium sulfate)-induced IBD model. ManLAM-induced B10 cells decrease  severity in the mice. The B10 cells downregulate Th1 polarization in spleen and MLNs (mesenteric lymph nodes) of DSS-treated mice. These results suggest that IL-10 production by ManLAM-treated  cells contributes to keeping the balance between CD4 T cell subsets and protect mice from DSS-induced IBD.© 2019 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31220606>Characterization of Clostridioides difficile ribotypes in domestic dogs in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</a></h2><p>Clostridioides difficile is the major etiologic agent of nosocomial bacterial diarrhoea and pseudomembranous . The pathogenesis of C. difficile infection (CDI)involves two cytotoxic enzymes (TcdA, TcdB) that cause colonic epithelial damage, fluid accumulation and enteritis. CDI has been demonstrated in a variety of animal species and some reports have recently raised the importance of wild animals as a reservoir of this pathogen and possible transmission to humans and domestic animals. The aim of this study was to characterize C. difficile isolates obtained from pet dogs in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A total of 50 faecal samples were obtained from healthy and diarrheic dogs. Five of fifty samples (10%) grew C. difficile. Of those, three belonged to the PCR ribotype 106 (ST 42) and were toxigenic (A). The other two strains belonged to the PCR ribotype 010 (ST 15) and were not toxin producers (A). None of the isolates tested positive for the binary toxin genes. Considering the antimicrobial resistance patterns of all isolates using EUCAST breakpoints, all strains were sensitive to metronidazole and vancomycin. However, two strains (ribotype 106 and ribotype 010), were resistant to clindamycin (≤256 μg/mL). All strains were strong biofilm producers. Our study provides evidence that dogs can act as reservoirs for C. difficile epidemic ribotypes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the impact of isolated oat beta-glucan fractions of low and high molecular weight, taken as dietary supplementation, on inflammatory markers in the  model.Two groups of Sprague-Dawley rats-control and with experimentally induced -were subsequently divided into three subgroups and fed over 21 days feed supplemented with 1% of low (βGl) or high (βGh) molecular weight oat beta-glucan fraction or feed without supplementation. The level of colon inflammatory markers, cytokines, and their receptors' genes expressions and immune cells numbers were measured by ELISA, RT-PCR, and by flow cytometry methods, respectively.The results showed moderate inflammation affecting the colon mucosa and submucosa, with significant changes in the number of lymphocytes in the colon tissue, elevated cytokines and eicosanoid levels, as well as disruption of the main cytokine and chemokine cell signaling pathways in  rats. Beta-glucans supplementation caused a reverse in the percentage of lymphocytes with stronger effects of βGh and reduction of the levels of the inflammatory markers, and improvement of cytokine and chemokine signaling pathways with stronger effects of βGl supplementation.The results indicate the therapeutic effect of dietary oat beta-glucan supplementation in the  in evident relation to the molecular weight of polymer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31117199>Effect of Forced Physical Activity on the Severity of Experimental  in Normal Weight and Obese Mice.

Cross talk between adipokines and myokines, as well as changes in intestinal microcirculation, was proposed in pathogenesis of these disorders. C57BL/6 male mice were fed ad libitum for 12 weeks a standard (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD). After the adaptation period, two groups of animals fed SD or HFD were subjected to 6 weeks of the forced treadmill exercise and the experimental  was induced in both groups of sedentary and exercising mice fed SD and HFD by intra-colonic administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. The disease activity index (DAI), colonic blood flow (CBF), the weight of animals, caloric intake, the mesenteric fad pad, the colonic oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and intestinal expression and protein content of proinflammatory markers were evaluated. Macroscopic and microscopic  in sedentary SD mice was accompanied by a significant fall in CBF and exacerbated in those fed a HFD. The contents of MDA, GSH, and SOD activity were significantly increased in both SD and HFD fed mice with treadmill exercise as compared with sedentary mice. In sedentary HFD mice a significant increase in the intestinal oxidative stress parameters and mucosal expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-17, IFNγ, IL-6, and IL-10 protein were observed and these effects were aggravated in mice subjected to forced treadmill exercise. The mucosal expression of mRNA for TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS, COX-2, SOD-1, SOD-2, GPx mRNAs, and the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α protein expression were upregulated in colonic mucosa of treadmill exercising HFD mice with  compared with those without exercise. We conclude that forced treadmill running exacerbates the severity of colonic damage in obese mice due to a fall in colonic microcirculation, an increase in oxidative stress, and the rise in expression and activity of proinflammatory biomarkers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406920>Cilostazol against 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced : Effect on tight junction, inflammation, and apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases are immunologically mediated disorders of gastrointestinal tract, characterized by dysregulated immune responses that result in a chronic intestinal inflammation. The antiplatelet cilostazol (CS), a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor, exerted a beneficial effect on several models of gastrointestinal diseases; however, the full mechanism of action in this context has not been unveiled.The current study aimed to elucidate the potential role of CS in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced  model.Male Wistar rats were divided into a sham group and groups treated with sulfasalazine (500 mg/kg), CS (50 and 100 mg/kg), and a combination (sulfasalazine/CS 50 mg/kg). All treatments were administered orally 15 days, with TNBS rectal administration on the 11th day.TNBS-produced  manifested as a decrease in the epithelial junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) and as an increase in trefoil factor-3, ulcerative area, and colon mass index, parameters that collaborate with the gross macroscopic changes in colon tissue. In addition, TNBS increased hemeoxygenase-1, nuclear factor-kappa , P-selectin, and myeloperoxidase, as well as the apoptotic ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. Administration of CS alone, especially at the high dose level, attenuated the severity of TNBS-induced  in a sulfasalazine-comparable manner. In addition, a better effect was mediated by the combination regimen, which succeeded in normalizing most of the measured parameters.CS protected the colon against TNBS through its anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects along with maintaining cellular tight junctions (TJs).

However, the action mechanisms of sword bean have not yet been clearly defined. In the present study, the whole parts of a ripened sword bean (RSB) and the green sword bean (GSB) containing bean pod were extracted with ethanol by reflux extraction. The two crude extracts (RSBE and GSBE) from RSB and GSB were validated by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis of gallic acid as a reference chemical. The anti-inflammatory effects of two sword bean extracts were extensively investigated using LPS-stimulated macrophage cells. First, RSBE and GSBE significantly inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin-6 (IL-6), prostaglandinE (PGE), and nitric oxide (NO) in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. RSBE and GSBE showed no cytotoxicity to RAW264.7 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophage cells. In addition, the overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induced by LPS in RAW264.7 cells was significantly decreased by RSBE and GSBE. Western blotting and immunostaining analysis showed that RSBE and GSBE inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF- subunits, which correlated with the inhibitory effects on inhibitor kappa  (I) degradation. In dextran sulfated sodium (DSS)-induced  mice model, RSBE restored body weight, colon length, and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-, IL-6, interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interferon- (IFN-).

Ten tissue samples were biopsies and 6 were collected during resection (4 surgeries for colon perforation). Patients were treated between 2010 and 2018 in the United Kingdom. The tissues were analyzed by pathology, in situ hybridization (to detect EBV-encoded small RNAs [EBERs]), and immunohistochemistry. Clinical data were also collected.Colon tissues from 4 of the 13 patients who received anti-CTLA4 (alone or in combination, 4 with colon perforation) had EBV-positive lymphoproliferations that manifested as florid ulcers associated with polymorphous infiltrates containing EBV-positive blasts (CD30+ or CD30-negative, CD20+, CD3-negative, and EBER+), plasma cells (CD138+, CD20-negative, and EBER+ or EBER-negative), and small  cells (CD20+, CD3-negative, and EBER+ or EBER-negative), consistent with EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers (EBVMCUs). In analyses of biopsies collected from 2 patients with EBVMCUs over multiple time points, we found that earlier biopsies had no or only a few EBV-positive cells, whereas 1 later biopsy had EBVMCU and co-infection with cytomegalovirus. EBVMCUs were associated with steroid-refractory  (100% of EBV-positive patients vs 12.5% of EBV-negative patients; P=.008) and colon perforation (100% of EBV-positive patients vs no EBV-negative patients; P=.001).We found that colon tissues from 4/13 patients with  after anti-CTLA4 therapy (4/6 patients who underwent resection and 4/4 patients with colon perforation) contained EBVMCUs.

However, the mechanisms employed by IRGM to restrain the inflammation are not known. In our recent study, we showed that IRGM negatively regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation. IRGM employs 2 parallel approaches to constrain inflammasome activation. First, IRGM directly interacts with NLRP3 and PYCARD/ASC, and mediates their SQSTM1/p62-dependent macroautophagic/autophagic degradation. Second, IRGM impedes inflammasome assembly by blocking the polymerization of NLRP3 and PYCARD. We also found that IRGM suppresses NLRP3-mediated exacerbated outcomes of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced  in a mouse model. Taken together, this study presents evidence that IRGM can directly regulate inflammation and protect from inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31279995>Rapid Detection of Clostridium difficile Toxins in Stool by Raman Spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>Clinical practice guidelines define Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) as diarrhea (≥3 unformed stools in 24 h) with either a positive C difficile stool test or detection of pseudomembranous . Diagnostic modalities such as toxigenic culture and nucleic acid amplification testing can identify the presence of toxigenic C difficile in stools. But these tests are confounded by the presence of asymptomatic colonization of toxigenic C difficile and lead to overdiagnosis of CDI. The presence of two large toxins, toxin A and  (TcdA and TcdB) is necessary for pathogenicity. Detection of toxins using toxin enzyme immunoassay is difficult as it has low sensitivity and moderate specificity. Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a novel technology that is used to detect bacteria and their toxins. RS does not require any reagents for detection such as antibodies, enzymes, primers, or stains. We hypothesize that RS is a sensitive method to detect C difficile toxins in stool and will solve the problem of overdiagnosis of CDI.CDI negative stool samples were spiked with concentrations (1 ng/mL, 100 pg/mL, 1 pg/mL, and 0.1 pg/mL) of TcdA and TcdB. RS was performed on air-dried smeared samples of stool supernatant on a mirror-polished stainless-steel slide. As RS of feces is difficult because of confounding background material and autofluorescence, samples were photo-bleached before spectral acquisition to reduce autofluorescence. Raman spectra were obtained, background corrected, and vector normalized. The data were split into training (70%) and test (30%) datasets. The machine learning methods used on the training data set were Support Vector Machine with Linear and Radial Kernels, Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Boosting Machine, and Principle Component Analysis-Linear Discriminant Analysis. Results were validated using a test data set. The best model was chosen, and its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were determined.In our preliminary results, at all concentrations (1 ng/mL, 100 pg/mL, 1 pg/mL, and 0.1 pg/mL), TcdA or TcdB spiked stool was distinguished from unspiked stool by all models with accuracies ranging from 64% to 77%. Gradient Boosting Machine, Principle Component Analysis-Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machine Linear Kernel performed best with sensitivities ranging from 69% to 90% and specificities ranging from 43% to 78%.Using RS, we successfully detected TcdA and TcdB in stool samples albeit with moderate-to-high sensitivity and low-to-moderate specificity. Sensitivity and specificity could be further increased with the implementation of deep learning methods, which require large sample sizes. In terms of sensitivity, RS performs better than toxin enzyme immunoassay and has the potential to rapidly detect C difficile toxins in stool at clinically relevant concentrations and thereby help mitigate overdiagnosis of CDI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Fulminant C. difficile  (FCDC) is a severe form of the  driven by a significant systemic inflammatory response, and managed with a total abdominal colectomy. Despite surgery, postoperative mortality rates remain high. The aim of this study was to develop a bedside calculator to predict the risk of 30-day postoperative mortality for patients with FCDC.After institutional review board approval, the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (2005-2015) was used to include adult patients who underwent emergency surgery for FCDC. A priori preoperative predictors of mortality were selected from the literature: age, immunosuppression, preoperative shock, intubation, and laboratory values. The predictive accuracy of different logistic regression models was measured by calculating the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve. A cohort of 124 patients from Québec was used to validate the developed mortality calculator.A total of 557 patients met the inclusion criteria, and the overall mortality was 44%. After developing the calculator, no statistically significant differences were found in comparison with the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program probability of mortality available in the database (area under the receiver operating curve, 75.61 vs. 75.14; p = 0.79). External validation with the cohort of patients from Quebec showed an area under the curve of 74.0% (95% confidence interval, 65.0-82.9).A clinically applicable calculator using preoperative variables to predict postoperative mortality for patients with FCDC was developed and externally validated.

The fidelity of these functions depends on the precision of intercellular signaling amongst cellular elements, including enteric neurons, epithelial cells, immune cells, and glia, all of which are vulnerable to disruptive influences during inflammatory events. This review article describes current knowledge regarding inflammation-induced neuroplasticity along key elements of enteric neural circuits, what is known about the causes of these changes, and possible therapeutic targets for protecting and/or repairing the integrity of intrinsic enteric neurotransmission. Changes that have been detected in response to inflammation include increased epithelial serotonin availability, hyperexcitability of intrinsic primary afferent neurons, facilitation of synaptic activity amongst enteric neurons, and attenuated purinergic neuromuscular transmission. Dysfunctional propulsive motility has been detected in models of , where causes include the changes described above, and in models of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune conditions, where autoantibodies are thought to mediate dysmotility. Other cells implicated in inflammation-induced neuroplasticity include muscularis macrophages and enteric glia.

Herein, we compared simultaneously analyzed blood transcriptomes from patients with PBC, PSC, and IBD. Microarray-based measurements were conducted using RNA isolated from whole blood samples from 90, 45, 95 and 93 patients with PBC, PSC, CD, and UC, respectively, and 47 healthy controls. Expression levels of selected transcripts were analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcribed PCR using an independent cohort of 292, 71 and 727 patients with PBC, PSC, and IBD, respectively. Of 4026, 2650 and 4967 probe sets differentially expressed (adjusted p-value < 0.05) in samples from patients with PBC, PSC, and IBD, respectively, compared with healthy controls, 1946 were common to all three comparisons. Functional analyses indicated that most terms enriched for genes differentially expressed in PBC, PSC, and IBD patients compared with healthy controls were related to mitochondrial function, the vesicle endomembrane system, and GTPase-mediated processes.

Microbe-host interactions in the intestine occur along the mucus-covered epithelium. In the gastrointestinal tract, mucus is composed of glycan-covered proteins, or mucins, which are secreted by goblet cells to form a protective gel-like structure above the epithelium. Low levels of mucin or alterations in mucin glycans are associated with inflammation and  in mice and humans. Although current literature links microbes to the modulation of goblet cells and mucins, the molecular pathways involved are not yet fully understood.

Of these, 35 had active disease and 26 had depression. Those with depression were more likely to be female, lack social support, have active disease, be taking corticosteroids but not TNF-alpha inhibitors and exhibit less positive emotional recognition bias. On multivariable regression analysis, depression was associated independently with lack of social support (unstandardized regression coefficient () = -1.40, P = 0.02) and increased disease activity ( = 1.29, P = 0.03). Causal steps analysis was consistent with less positive emotional recognition bias partially mediating the effects of disease activity on depression.This is the first study to demonstrate links between disease activity and less positive biases in emotional recognition that could explain higher rates of depression among people with active IBD. Future prospective studies are required to confirm the effects of emotional processing biases in depression and allow stronger causal inferences to be drawn.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31190556> and its applications in medicine.</a></h2><p> is a probiotic bacterium that produces spores.

Interleukin (IL)-33 is involved in various immune responses, with reported proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects, which may be associated with  and -associated cancer. IL-33 induces the inflammatory cascade through its receptor, suppression of tumorigenicity-2 (ST-2). Binding of IL-33 to membrane-bound ST-2 (mST-2) recruits the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) and activates intracellular signaling pathways. However, whether IL-33/ST-2 is triggered by  infection and whether this interaction occurs in lipid rafts remain unclear. Our study showed that both IL-33 and ST-2 expression levels were significantly elevated in -infected cells. Confocal microscopy showed that ST-2 mobilized into the membrane lipid rafts during infection. Depletion of membrane cholesterol dampened -induced IL-33 and IL-8 production. Furthermore, in vivo studies revealed IL-33/ST-2 upregulation, and severe leukocyte infiltration was observed in gastric tissues infected with . Together, these results demonstrate that ST-2 recruitment into the lipid rafts serves as a platform for IL-33-dependent  infection, which aggravates inflammation in the stomach.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122858>Deciphering the domain specificity of C. difficile toxin neutralizing antibodies.</a></h2><p>Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the principal cause of nosocomial diarrhea and pseudomembranous  associated with antibiotic therapy. The pathological effects of CDI are primarily attributed to toxins A (TcdA) and  (TcdB). Adequate toxin-specific antibody responses are associated with asymptomatic carriage, whereas insufficient humoral responses are associated with recurrent CDI. While the data supporting the importance of anti-toxin antibodies are substantial, clarity about the toxin domain specificity of these antibodies is more limited. To investigate this matter, combinations of human mAbs targeting multiple domains of TcdB were assessed using toxin neutralization assays. These data revealed that a combination of mAbs specific to all major toxin domains had improved neutralizing potency when compared to equivalent concentrations of a single mAb or a combination of mAbs against one or two domains. The function and toxin domain binding specificity of serum antibodies elicited by immunization of hamsters with a toxoid vaccine candidate was also assessed. Immunization with a toxoid vaccine candidate provoked toxin neutralizing antibodies specific to multiple domains of both TcdA and TcdB. When assessed in a toxin neutralization assay, polyclonal sera displayed greater activity against elevated concentrations of toxins than equivalent concentrations of individual mAbs. These data suggest a potential benefit of any antibody based therapeutic or prophylactic treatment that targets multiple toxin domains.Copyright © 2019.

To collect all the published data about patients treated with dual biological therapy with an Anti-TNF, vedolizumab or ustekinumab, for a period of at least 3 months and to pool the data about the effectiveness and safety.  A MEDLINE, and Web of Science search of all studies published in English until 1 January 2019 was conducted.  We included 7 studies with a total of 18 patients. Fifteen patients were treated with a combination of an anti-TNF and vedolizumab, 3 patients were treated with vedolizumab and ustekinumab. Fifty-six percent of patients were affected by Crohn's disease and 50% of patients were treated with an immunosuppressant drug or steroid too. A clinical improvement was obtained in 100% of patients, and an endoscopic improvement in 93% of patients. No serious adverse events were reported.  The use of dual biological therapy is an attractive therapeutic option and may be an opportunity to better tailor and personalize the therapies for patients.

Our objective was to explore the mechanism of intestinal inflammation inhibiting growth in the setting of asymptomatic .Forty-eight 3-week-old Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: the control group,  group (with asymptomatic  induced by 2.5% trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid) and pair-fed group (daily food intake matched to the pair in the  group). The linear growth was assessed, and the plasma levels of hormone and systemic cytokines were detected and compared by independent two-sample t-test or one-way ANOVA among groups.At d5, the increases in the body length of the control,  and pair-fed groups were 1.65 ± 0.34 cm, 1.10 ± 0.30 cm and 1.38 ± 0.26 cm, respectively, and the increase in the body length in the  group was significantly less than that in the control group (P < 0.05). There were significant differences in the levels of hormone and cytokines among three groups (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, rats in the  group exhibited linear growth failure, as well as higher expression of calprotectin, tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2, lower insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3, and lower expression of nuclear factor kappa  in hepatocytes.In addition to undernutrition, the systemic inflammatory response caused by asymptomatic  may inhibit the linear growth of rats by its influence on the insulin-like growth factor/insulin-like growth factor binding protein axis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560043>Tofacitinib Reprograms Human Monocytes of IBD Patients and Healthy Controls Toward a More Regulatory Phenotype.</a></h2><p>The inhibition of Janus kinases (JAKs) and subsequent signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) by tofacitinib represents a new therapeutic strategy in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) as clinical trials have led to approval of tofacitinib for ulcerative  (UC) and hint at a possible efficacy for Crohn`s disease (CD). However, the impact of tofacitinib on cellular response of monocytes, which are key players in inflammatory responses, has not been investigated so far. We aimed to analyze JAK/STAT-inhibition by tofacitinib in monocytes of IBD patients and healthy controls.Primary monocytes of IBD patients with active disease and healthy controls (n = 18) were analyzed for cytokine expression and phenotype after granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)/interferon (IFN)γ-stimulation and tofacitinib pretreatment (1-1000 nM) and capacity to induce Foxp3+-regulatory T cells (Tregs) in cocultures. In total, 20 UC patients and 21 CD patients were included. Additionally, dose-dependent inhibition of JAK/STAT-phosphorylation was analyzed in controls.Pro-inflammatory costimulation with GM-CSF/IFNγ resulted in significant tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) and interleukin (IL)-6 increase, whereas IL-10 expression decreased in monocytes. Tofacitinib modulated the responses of activated monocytes toward a regulatory phenotype through reduced TNFα and IL-6 secretion and enhanced Treg induction in cocultures. However, in monocytes from active IBD patients, higher tofacitinib dosages were needed for blockade of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Tofacitinib induced stronger regulatory phenotypes in monocytes of UC patients, including more effective inhibition of pro-inflammatory pathways and better restoration of anti-inflammatory mechanisms as compared with CD-derived monocytes.Tofacitinib dose-dependently reprograms monocytes toward a more regulatory cell type. This beneficial effect possibly results from selective JAK/STAT-blockade by adequate tofacitinib dosage with inhibition of pro-inflammatory responses and permission of a balance-shift toward regulatory pathways.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

We aimed to test if an FC test used in combination with FIT could improve the predictive ability. Consecutive out-patients with UC ( = 93) who were admitted for colonoscopy completed a single faecal sample before the start of bowel preparation. A quantitative CALPRO calprotectin ELISA test and a qualitative FIT (cut-off < 40 ng/mL) were analyzed. An estimated Mayo score and a score of histological inflammation was performed blinded to the result of the faecal tests. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value for endoscopic inflammation (Mayo score > 1) was for FIT 85%, 83%, 96%, 57% and for FC > 186 µg/g 73%, 87%, 87%, 54%. Corresponding results for FIT*FC > 186 µg/g (at least one test positive) were 92%, 69%, 97%, 43%. For detecting moderate/severe histological inflammation the results were for FIT 69%, 79%, 92%, 43%, for FC > 75 µg/g 95%, 62%, 98%, 41%, and for FIT*FC > 75 µg/g 100%, 60%, 100%, 36%. None of the markers alone or in combination were useful to predict deep remission (Mayo score = 0 and no histological inflammation).

This study aimed to investigate if RNase A-treated EC-12 could also produce IL-10 and to evaluate the possible effects of IL-10 produced by RNase A-treated EC-12. Three experiments were conducted: (1) Assessment of the effect of RNase A-treated EC-12 on transcriptome profiles and biological pathways in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells; (2) Determination of cytokine concentration in its culture supernatants; and (3) Supplementation of RNase A-treated EC-12 (RN) to mice with dextran sodium sulfate-induced . Treatment of EC-12 with RNase A inhibited inflammatory response including the potency to induce IL-12 production, while it did not affect IL-10 production (Experiment 1 and 2).  symptoms were milder in RN than in PBS-supplemented controls (Experiment 3). RNase A-treated EC-12 likely became an anti-inflammatory agent primarily inducing IL-10 production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31010141>The Anti-Inflammatory Role of Mannich Curcuminoids; Special Focus on .</a></h2><p>The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) increases gradually in Western countries with high need for novel therapeutic interventions. Mannich curcuminoids, C142 or C150 synthetized in our laboratory, have been tested for anti-inflammatory activity in a rat model of TNBS (2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid) induced . Treatment with C142 or C150 reduced leukocyte infiltration to the submucosa and muscular propria of the inflamed gut. C142 or C150 rescued the loss of body weight and C150 decreased the weight of standard colon preparations proportional with 20% less tissue oedema. Both C142 and C150 curcumin analogues caused 25% decrease in the severity of colonic inflammation and haemorrhagic lesion size. Colonic MPO (myeloperoxidase) enzyme activity as an indicator of intense neutrophil infiltration was 50% decreased either by C142 or C150 Mannich curcuminoids. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) co-treatment with Mannich curcuminoids inhibited NF-κ (nuclear factor kappa ) activity on a concentration-dependent manner in an NF-κ-driven luciferase expressing reporter cell line. Co-treatment with LPS and curcuminoids, C142 or C150, resulted in NF-κ inhibition with 3.57 μM or 1.6 μM half maximal effective concentration (EC) values, respectively. C150 exerted a profound inhibition of the expression of inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-4 (IL-4) in human PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) upon LPS stimulus.

A revision of the analytical assays used for assessing anti-TNF plasma levels is also provided. : Although there is a consensus across studies that higher anti-TNF trough levels are associated with a better clinical outcome, and that early anti-TNF serum measurements could be predictive of long-term response, it is still not clear what the best predictive time of sampling is and what the ideal target drug plasma concentration to achieve.

In this study, we aimed to assess the safety and preliminary antitumour activity of ramucirumab (an IgG1 VEGFR-2 antagonist) combined with pembrolizumab (an IgG4 PD-1 antagonist) in patients with previously treated advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, or urothelial carcinoma.We did a multicohort, non-randomised, open-label, phase 1a/ trial at 16 academic medical centres, hospitals, and clinics in the USA, France, Germany, Spain, and the UK. We enrolled adult patients aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (cohorts A and ), non-small-cell lung cancer (cohort C), or urothelial carcinoma (cohort D), whose disease had progressed on one or two lines of previous therapy (for those with gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma) or one to three lines of previous therapy (for those with non-small-cell lung cancer and urothelial carcinoma) that included platinum (for all tumour types) or fluoropyrimidine or both (for gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma). Eligibility criteria included presence of measurable disease and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1. Patients with previously untreated gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer were also enrolled (in two additional separate cohorts); the results for these cohorts will be reported separately. The first 21-day treatment cycle was a dose-limiting toxicity observation period (phase 1a; safety run-in), followed by a phase 1b cohort expansion stage. Pembrolizumab 200 mg was administered intravenously on day 1, and intravenous ramucirumab was administered at 8 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 for cohort A or at 10 mg/kg on day 1 for cohorts , C, and D, every 3 weeks, until disease progression or other discontinuation criteria were met. The primary endpoint was the safety and tolerability of ramucirumab in combination with pembrolizumab assessed by the incidence of adverse events in both phase 1a and 1b and as dose-limiting toxicities during phase 1a. The safety and activity analysis set included all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number , and is no longer enrolling patients.Between July 30, 2015 and June 24, 2016, we enrolled and treated 92 patients (41 with gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, 27 with non-small-cell lung cancer, and 24 with urothelial carcinoma). Median follow-up was 32·8 months (IQR 28·1-33·6). During the first cycle of treatment (phase 1a safety run-in; n=11), one patient with gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who received the 8 mg/kg dose of ramucirumab had grade 3 abdominal pain, , hepatitis, interstitial lung disease, and jaundice, and grade 4 cholestasis, and died on treatment on day 40; the death was deemed related to progressive disease. No additional dose-limiting toxicities occurred and the decision was made to maintain the full planned doses of ramucirumab and pembrolizumab in phase 1b (n=81). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 75 (82%) of 92 patients, the most common of which was fatigue (in 33 patients [36%]), predominantly of grade 1 or 2 severity. 22 patients (24%) had one or more treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse, most commonly hypertension (six patients; 7%) and  (five patients; 5%). Serious adverse events occurred in 53 (58%) of 92 patients, and were deemed related to treatment in 22 (24%) patients. The most common treatment-related serious adverse events were abdominal pain in patients with gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (in three [7%] of 41 patients); asthenia and myocardial infarction in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (two [7%] of 27 patients), and  in patients with urothelial carcinoma (two [8%] of 24 patients). Six (7%) of 92 patients discontinued treatment because of treatment-related adverse events, and one death (from pulmonary sepsis in a patient with gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma) was deemed related to treatment. The number of patients achieving an objective response was three (7%; 95% CI 1·5-19·9) of 41 in the gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma cohort, eight (30%; 13·8-50·2) of 27 in the non-small-cell lung cancer cohort, and three (13%, 2·7-32·4) in the urothelial carcinoma cohort.Ramucirumab in combination with pembrolizumab showed a manageable safety profile with favourable antitumour activity in patients with previously treated advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, and urothelial carcinoma. Our results contribute to the growing evidence that supports dual inhibition of the VEGF-VEGFR2 and PD-1-PD-L1 pathways. This combination could be further explored with or without chemotherapy, especially for patients with tumours for which single-agent checkpoint inhibitors have shown no additional benefit over chemotherapy.Eli Lilly and Company, and Merck and Co.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

These processes are critically involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory-based disorders of the gut, like inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Accordingly, our aim was to investigate the role of the EphB/ephrin- system in intestinal inflammation by assessing the local and systemic effects produced by its pharmacological manipulation in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)- (Th1-dependent model) and dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)- (innate response model) induced  in mice. To this purpose, we administered chimeric Fc-conjugated proteins, allegedly able to uni-directionally activate either forward (ephrin-B1-Fc) or reverse (EphB1-Fc) signaling, and the soluble monomeric EphB4 extracellular domain protein, that, simultaneously interfering with both signaling pathways, acts as EphB/ephrin- antagonist.The blockade of the EphB/ephrin- forward signaling by EphB4 and EphB1-Fc was ineffective against DSS-induced  while it evoked remarkable beneficial effects against TNBS : it counteracted all the evaluated inflammatory responses and the changes elicited on splenic T lymphocytes subpopulations, without preventing the appearance of a splice variant of ephrin-B2 gene elicited by the haptenating agent in the colon. Interestingly, EphB4, preferentially displacing EphB4/ephrin-B2 interaction over EphB1/ephrin-B1 binding, was able to promote Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) release by splenic mononuclear cells . On the whole, the collected results point to a potential role of the EphB/ephrin- system as a pharmacological target in intestinal inflammatory disorders and suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of its blockade seemingly works through the modulation of immune responses, independent of the changes at the transcriptional and translational level of EphB4 and ephrin-B2 genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620540>Ulcerative  and Familial Mediterranean Fever: Can Anakinra Treat Both?</a></h2><p>Anakinra is a biological drug used in rheumatoid arthritis and several autoinflammatory diseases.

Here, we found that a recombinant CTB containing an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention motif (CTB-KDEL) induces colon epithelial wound healing in   the activation of an unfolded protein response (UPR) in colon epithelial cells. In a Caco2 cell wound healing model, CTB-KDEL, but not CTB or CTB-KDE, facilitated cell migration  interaction with the KDEL receptor, localization in the ER, UPR activation, and subsequent TGF-β signaling. Inhibition of the inositol-requiring enzyme 1/X-box binding protein 1 arm of UPR abolished the cell migration effect of CTB-KDEL, indicating that the pathway is indispensable for the activity. CTB-KDEL's capacity to induce UPR and epithelial restitution or wound healing was corroborated in a dextran sodium sulfate-induced acute  mouse model. Furthermore, CTB-KDEL induced a UPR, up-regulated wound healing pathways, and maintained viable crypts in colon explants from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In summary, CTB-KDEL exhibits unique wound healing effects in the colon that are mediated by its localization to the ER and subsequent activation of UPR in epithelial cells.

Microcystin-leucine arginine (MC-LR) is a toxin produced by cyanobacteria during algal blooms and demonstrates bioaccumulation in the intestinal tract following ingestion. Little is known about the impact of MC-LR ingestion in individuals with IBD. In this study, we sought to investigate MC-LR's effects in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  model. Mice were separated into four groups: (a) water only (control), () DSS followed by water (DSS), (c) water followed by MC-LR (MC-LR), and (d) DSS followed by MC-LR (DSS + MC-LR). DSS resulted in weight loss, splenomegaly, and severe  marked by transmural acute inflammation, ulceration, shortened colon length, and bloody stools. DSS + MC-LR mice experienced prolonged weight loss and bloody stools, increased ulceration of colonic mucosa, and shorter colon length as compared with DSS mice. DSS + MC-LR also resulted in greater increases in pro-inflammatory transcripts within colonic tissue (TNF-α, IL-1β, CD40, MCP-1) and the pro-fibrotic marker, PAI-1, as compared to DSS-only ingestion. These findings demonstrate that MC-LR exposure not only prolongs, but also worsens the severity of pre-existing , strengthening evidence of MC-LR as an under-recognized environmental toxin in vulnerable populations, such as those with IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30973416>Prevalence of Clostridium difficile infection among hospitalized inflammatory bowel disease patients in Greece.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an independent risk factor for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), which is associated significantly with disease severity.

The most common VPDs among patients with IBD were herpes zoster virus (HZV) (34.9%) and hepatitis  virus (31.6%), followed by influenza (22.1%). Pneumococcal pneumonia (9.1%) and hepatitis A virus (2.4%) were less common. Inpatients with IBD were twice as likely to have HZV when compared to non-IBD inpatients (odds ratios [OR] = 2.30 [95% CI, 2.06-2.58], P < 0.0001) This finding was consistent for every study year. Pneumococcal pneumonia [OR = 0.62 (95% CI, 0.52-0.74), P < 0.0001] and influenza [OR = 0.72 (95% CI, 0.63-0.81), P < 0.0001] were significantly lower in the IBD population. There was no difference for other VPDs.HZV was the most frequent VPD in IBD inpatients. Patients with IBD have a higher rate of hospital admissions with HZV and a lower rate of pneumococcal pneumonia and influenza admissions when compared with non-IBD patients. For other VPDs, patients with IBD have the same rate of admission as the general population.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Retrospective Comparison of Toxicity and Efficacy on 222 Patients in the First 100 Days After Transplant, On Behalf of the Romanian Society for Bone Marrow Transplantation.</a></h2><p>High-dose chemotherapy (HDT) followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is widely used in patients with malignant lymphomas. In Europe over 8,000 ASCTs for lymphoma were performed out of a total of 40,000 transplants according to the European Bone Marrow Transplant (EBMT) activity survey in 2017. ASCT is considered the standard treatment for eligible patients failing to achieve remission after first line chemotherapy or patients with relapsed or refractory lymphomas, including classical Hodkin's lymphoma, diffuse large -cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma, as well as consolidation therapy in first remission in mantle cell lymphoma. BEAM (BCNU/carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) is the most commonly used conditioning regimen for ASCT in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) lymphomas in Europe, whereas the CBV (cyclophosphamide, BCNU, and etoposide) regimen is also widely used in North America. Recently, concerns regarding BCNU toxicity as well as restricted availability of BCNU and melphalan has determined an increasing number of transplant centers to use alternative conditioning regimens. Currently, only a few comparative studies, most of them retrospective, between different conditioning protocols regarding efficacy and toxicity have been published. Thus, in the current manuscript, we report the experience of 2 transplant centers in ASCT in R/R lymphomas with three types of conditioning: BEAM, CLV (cyclophosphamide, lomustine, etoposide) and LEAM (lomustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan), with the aim to evaluate the results of alternative conditioning regimens using lomustine (LEAM and CLV) and compare them with the standard BEAM regarding early toxicity, engraftment, and transplant related mortality (TRM). All patients developed grade IV neutropenia, anemia with/without transfusion necessity. Severe thrombocytopenia with transfusion requirements is reported in most cases. Median time to platelet engraftment and neutrophil engraftment was 13 days (range) and 10 days (range), respectively. Gastrointestinal toxicity was the most common non-hematologic toxicity after all three conditioning regimens. Oral mucositis in various grades from I to IV was diagnosed in most cases. Other side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, , and skin rash but with low severity grades. For the LEAM arm, one patient died after transplant, before engrafting, one patient didn't achieve platelet engraftment in day 100, one patient developed grade 3 upper gastrointestinal bleeding, one patient died (grade 5 toxicity) with acute renal failure, one patient developed hypoxic events up to grade 4 acute respiratory failure and one patient developed grade 3 itchy skin rash. For the CLV arm, one patient died after transplant, before engrafting, one patient developed grade 3 , one patient with grade 3 hepatic cytolysis, one patient with cardiac toxicity followed by death (grade 5) caused by an acute myocardial infarction with ST elevation and one patient with pulmonary toxicity clinically manifested with grade 3 pleurisy. For the BEAM arm, one patient developed grade 3 cardiac toxicity with sinus bradycardia and afterwards grade 4 with acute pulmonary edema, three patients presented a grade 3 pruritic skin rash and two patients developed grade 3 seizures. In the present study we presented the differences that were observed between BEAM, LEAM, and CLV conditioning regimens offering clinical arguments for an SCT practitioner choice in the ideal situation, but also of choice for alternative regimens in the case that one regimen cannot be used.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670003>Injected laquinimod D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate polymeric micelles for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic relapsing disorders of the gastrointestinal tract characterized pathologically by intestinal inflammation and epithelial injury. Laquinimod (LAQ), a poorly water-soluble compound, was proved to be effective for  remission at low dose of 0.5 mg/kg in patients with Crohn's disease. Due to its extremely low solubility in water, it was difficult to develop an injectable liquid dosage form. Herein, D-α-Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate (TPGS) polymeric micelles were developed as a delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease. Using the LAQ/TPGS ratio of 1:100, LAQ-loaded micelles were successfully prepared by thin-film dispersion method. The solubility of LAQ in water was significantly increased from 10.5 μg/mL in pure water to 500 μg/mL in TPGS micelles. LAQ-loaded micelles of TPGS exhibited the fine particle size of 34.6 nm and Zeta potential of -0.67 mV. Moreover, the good stability of LAQ-loaded micelles in physiology-mimicking medium was confirmed by detecting their particle size, zeta potential and leakage of the loading drug. Therapeutic effect of LAQ-loaded micelles on DSS-induced mice was proved by detecting DAI score, colon length and loss of body weight. Moreover, the morphology and colonic mucosal barrier of the injured colon of DSS-induced mice was largely recovered after treatment with LAQ-loaded micelles. Meanwhile, the inflammation of  colon was also obviously alleviated by LAQ-loaded micelles. Conclusively, polymeric micelles of TPGS may be a promising delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

This study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of PBK-1701TC compared with OSS in bowel preparation for colonoscopy.This randomized, multicenter, phase 3 non-inferiority trial included adults aged 19 years or older with a body mass index of 19-30 kg/m undergoing colonoscopy at five university hospitals in Korea. The primary efficacy endpoint was successful bowel-cleansing rate, defined as Harefield Cleansing Scale grade A or  as evaluated by blinded central readers. Secondary endpoints included the presence of residual air bubbles. Adverse events and laboratory evaluations were monitored to assess safety. Tolerability was assessed via participant interview.Overall, 235 participants were randomized, and 224 were included in the per-protocol analysis (PBK, 112; OSS, 112). Successful bowel cleansing was achieved for 95.5% (107/112) in the PBK group, which was non-inferior to the OSS group (98.2%, 110/112) with a difference of -2.7% (one sided 97.5% confidence limit, -8.1%). The participants in the PBK group had fewer intraluminal bubbles (0.9% vs 81.3%, P < 0.001) and reported a lower incidence of nausea and vomiting, with better acceptance, taste, and willingness to repeat the regimen than those in the OSS group (all P < 0.05).The novel sulfate tablet, PBK-1701TC, was non-inferior to OSS with respect to bowel-cleansing efficacy and exhibited better safety and tolerability in adults undergoing colonoscopy.© 2019 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987344>Exopolysaccharide-Producing  Strains with Similar Adhesion Property Induce Differential Regulation of Inflammatory Immune Response in Treg/Th17 Axis of DSS- Mice.</a></h2><p>Intestinal bifidobacteria benefit human health by promoting and modulating the gut flora, and boosting therapeutic efficiency for chronic metabolic diseases and cancer. Recently,  strains with high adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells were associated with induction of T-helper 17 (Th17) cells in humans and rodents. Here, two  strains with similar adhesive ability but different aggregation properties were investigated for specific immunoregulatory effects, including the underlying cellular pathway, on macrophage and T-regulatory (Treg)/Th17 axis activation in vitro and in the colon of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)- mice in vivo. In-vitro, the auto-aggregative .  strain IF1-11 induced significantly higher IL-6 and lower IL-10 secretion from immune cells, and it induced abundant Th17 cells. The non-aggregating strain IF1-03 induced significantly higher IL-10, less IL-6 and a high proportion of Treg/Th17 cells compared to total T cells. In vivo, orally administered IF1-03 protected DSS- mice via activation of dendritic cells or macrophages and skewing of Treg/Th17 cells, consistent with Treg cell induction in vitro. IF1-03 exopolysaccharides showed a functional recognition pattern similar to IF1-03 for IL-10 cytokine secretion and Treg cell-differentiation induction, both dependent on the toll-like receptor 2-ERK/p38 MAPK-signaling cascade for macrophage activation. We suggest that .  exopolysaccharide-associated enterocyte adhesion/aggregation phenotypes determine strain-specific adaptive immune responses in the gut via the macrophage-regulated Treg/Th17 axis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30951716>Schisandrin  prevents ulcerative  and -associated-cancer by activating focal adhesion kinase and influence on gut microbiota in an in vivo and in vitro model.</a></h2><p>-associated cancer (CAC) has a close relationship with ulcerative  (UC). Therapeutic effect of Schisandrin  (SchB) on UC and CAC remains largely unknown. We investigated the preventative effect of SchB on the dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) model of UC and azoxymethane (AOM)/DSS model of CAC. Furthermore, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation and influence on commensal microbiota are important for UC treatment. Impact on FAK activation by SchB in UC development was evaluated in vivo and vitro. We also conducted 16S rRNA sequencing to detect regulation of gut microbiota by SchB. Enhanced protection of intestinal epithelial barrier by SchB through activating FAK contributed to protective effect on colon for the fact that protection of SchB can be reversed by inhibition of FAK phosphorylation. Furthermore, influence on gut microbiota by SchB also played a significant role in UC prevention. Our results revealed that SchB was potent to prevent UC by enhancing protection of intestinal epithelial barrier and influence on gut microbiota, which led to inhibition of CAC. SchB was potential to become a new treatment for UC and prevention of CAC.Copyright © 2019.

Due to its immunomodulatory effect, vitamin D plays a role in chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and a deficiency is associated with an increased risk for a flare. We aimed to investigate to what extent the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D3) level correlates with disease activity and whether a cut-off value can be defined that discriminates between active disease and remission.Patients with IBD, treated at the University Hospital Frankfurt were analyzed retrospectively. The 25(OH)D3 levels were correlated with clinical activity indices and laboratory chemical activity parameters. A deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D3 levels <30 ng/mL.A total of 470 (257 female) patients with IBD were included, 272 (57.9%) with Crohn's disease (CD), 198 (42.1%) with ulcerative  (UC). The median age of the patients was 41 (18-84). In 283 patients (60.2%), a vitamin D deficiency was detected. 245 (53.6%) patients received oral vitamin D supplementation, and supplemented patients had significantly higher vitamin D levels (p < 0.0001). Remission, vitamin D substitution, and male gender were independently associated with the 25(OH)D3 serum concentration in our cohort in regression analysis. A 25(OH)D3 serum concentration of 27.5 ng/mL was the optimal cut-off value.Vitamin D deficiency is common in IBD patients and appears to be associated with increased disease activity. In our study, vitamin D levels were inversely associated with disease activity. Thus, close monitoring should be established, and optimized supplementation should take place.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075241>Stevioside, a diterpenoid glycoside, shows anti-inflammatory property against Dextran Sulphate Sodium-induced ulcerative  in mice.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease is an umbrella-term used to describe a set of chronic inflammatory conditions that affect the gastro-intestinal tract. Since most of the inflammatory medications in current use have several undesirable side-effects, stevioside, a naturally occurring, high-intensity sweetener was assessed in our study for its anti-inflammatory properties by in-vitro and in-vivo experiments. Stevioside was observed to significantly inhibit the levels of LPS induced elevation of cytokines, TNF-α (P < 0.05) and IL-6 (P < 0.001) as well as the production of reactive oxygen species (P < 0.01) and nitrites (P < 0.001) in RAW264.7 cells. Stevioside has also been evaluated for its anti-inflammatory effect by using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative  model in mice. Stevioside significantly reduced the disease activity index (DAI) score, ameliorated the inflammatory symptoms induced by DSS in mice and exhibited intact colon histo-architecture. Stevioside treatment significantly inhibited the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6, and the protein expressions of pro-inflammatory mediators, COX-2 (P < 0.01) and iNOS (P < 0.01) and restored the levels of endogenous anti-oxidants such as superoxide dismutase (P < 0.01), catalase (P < 0.001), glutathione s-transferase (P < 0.001) and reduced glutathione (P < 0.001) level in colon tissues. It was also observed that stevioside significantly suppressed NF-κ (p65) activation by abrogating Iκ phosphorylation and attenuated the phosphorylation of p38, ERK and JNK proteins in colon tissues. The findings of the present study suggest that stevioside exhibits anti-inflammatory property by inhibiting NF-κ (p65) and MAPK pathways and can be employed as an adjunct in nutraceuticals to treat IBD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Colorectal cancer is a disease widely associated with local chronic inflammation. Additionally, extrinsic factors such as infection may beneficially or detrimentally alter cancer progression. Several reports have noted the ability of various parasitic infections to modulate cancer development, favoring tumor progression in many cases and inhibiting tumorigenesis in others. The aim of our study was to determine the effects of excreted/secreted products of the helminth Taenia crassiceps (TcES) as a treatment in a murine model of -associated colon cancer (CAC). Here, we found that after inducing CAC, treatment with TcES was able to reduce inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-33 and IL-17 and significantly attenuate colon tumorigenesis. This effect was associated with the inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells (NF-κ) phosphorylation. Furthermore, we determined that TcES interfered with LPS-induced NF-κ p65 activation in human colonic epithelial cell lines in a Raf-1 proto-oncogene-dependent manner. Moreover, in three-dimensional cultures, TcES promoted reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, altering cell morphology and forming colonospheres, features associated with a low grade of aggressiveness. Our study demonstrates a remarkable effect of helminth-derived molecules on suppressing ongoing colorectal cancer by downregulating proinflammatory and protumorigenic signaling pathways.© 2019 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351880>AGA Technical Review on the Evaluation of Functional Diarrhea and Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Adults (IBS-D).</a></h2><p>The evaluation of patients with chronic watery diarrhea represents a diagnostic challenge for clinicians because organic causes, including inflammatory bowel disease, microscopic , and chronic infection, must be differentiated from functional diarrhea and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. The purpose of this review is to summarize the available evidence on the usefulness of diagnostic tests in such patients.We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE via OVID, from 1978 until April 2017. We included diagnostic test accuracy studies reporting on the use of fecal and blood tests for the evaluation of adult patients with functional diarrhea, including irritable bowel syndrome. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using a modified version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies II, and the certainty in the evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. We calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity, and the proportion of patients with true and false positive and negative results. We evaluated the following tests: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, fecal lactoferrin, fecal calprotectin, serologic tests for celiac disease, tests for bile acid diarrhea, the commercially available version of anti-cytolethal distending toxin  and anti-vinculin antibodies, and tests for Giardia infection. We did not evaluate breath tests for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, as they are not part of a standard diarrhea workup.Thirty-eight studies proved eligible to evaluate 1 or more of these tests. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were similar at discriminating organic from functional disease, with sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of 0.54-0.78 and 0.46-0.95 for erythrocyte sedimentation rate and 0.73 and 0.78 for C-reactive protein. Among fecal tests, fecal calprotectin in a range of 50-60 μg/g (pooled sensitivity 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.86; pooled specificity 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78-0.92) and fecal lactoferrin in a range of 4.0-7.25 μg/g (pooled sensitivity 0.79; 95% CI, 0.73-0.84; pooled specificity 0.93; 95%CI 0.63-0.99) presented the lowest proportion of false-negative results (low certainty in the evidence). Among tests for celiac disease, IgA tissue transglutaminase presented the best diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity range, 0.79-0.99; specificity range, 0.90-0.99) with moderate certainty in the evidence. Among tests for bile acid diarrhea, the selenium homotaurocholic acid test performed better than serum fibroblast growth factor 19 and 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, but is not available in the United States. There was insufficient evidence to recommend serologic tests for irritable bowel syndrome at this time. There are several good diagnostic tests for Giardia infection.Moderate to low certainty in the evidence indicates that available fecal and blood tests may play a role in the diagnostic workup of adult patients with functional diarrhea. At the moment, no tests are available to reliably rule in irritable bowel syndrome.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Decrease in Pgp function and expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD. However, inhibitory mechanisms involved in the decrease of Pgp in inflammation are not fully understood. Angiotensin II (Ang II), a peptide hormone predominantly expressed in the epithelial cells of the crypt-villus junction of the intestine, has been shown to exert pro-inflammatory effects in the gut. It is increased in IBD patients and animals with experimental . Whether Ang II directly influences Pgp is not known.Pgp activity was measured as verapamil-sensitive  H-digoxin flux. Pgp surface expression and exocytosis were measured by cell surface biotinylation studies. Signalling pathways were elucidated by Western blot analysis and pharmacological approaches.Ang II (10 nM) significantly inhibited Pgp activity at 60 minutes. Ang II-mediated effects on Pgp function were receptor-mediated as the Ang II receptor 1 (ATR1) antagonist, losartan, blocked Pgp inhibition. Ang II effects on Pgp activity appeared to be mediated via PI3 kinase, p38 MAPK and Akt signalling. Ang II-mediated inhibition of Pgp activity was associated with a decrease in the surface membrane expression of Pgp protein via decreased exocytosis and was found to be dependent on the Akt pathway. Short-term treatment of Ang II (2 mg/kg .wt., 2 hours) to mice also decreased the membrane expression of Pgp protein levels in ileum and colon.Our findings provide novel insights into the role of Ang II and ATR1 in decreasing Pgp expression in intestinal inflammation.Published 2019.

The levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2, interferon-γ, IL-4, IL-13, and IL-17A, were decreased, and that of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was increased, in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) treated with the L. fermentum KBL374 or KBL375 strain. When these strains were orally administered to mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced , both L. fermentum KBL374 and KBL375 showed beneficial effects on body weight, disease activity index score, colon length, cecal weight, and histological scores. Furthermore, both L. fermentum KBL374 and KBL375 modulated the innate immune response by improving gut barrier function and reducing leukocyte infiltration. Consistent with the PBMC data, both L. fermentum KBL374- and KBL375-treated DSS mice demonstrated decreased Th1-, Th2-, and Th17-related cytokine levels and increased IL-10 in the colon compared with the DSS control mice. Administration of L. fermentum KBL374 or KBL375 to mice increased the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Treg cell population in mesenteric lymph nodes. Additionally, L. fermentum KBL374 or KBL375 administration reshaped and increased the diversity of the gut microbiota. In particular, L. fermentum KBL375 increased the abundance of beneficial microorganisms, such as Lactobacillus spp. and Akkermansia spp. Both L. fermentum KBL374 and KBL375 may alleviate inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, in the gut by regulating immune responses and altering the composition of gut microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314927>Diagnostic value of fecal  cell activating factor in patients with abdominal discomfort.</a></h2><p>Fecal calprotectin has successfully been widely recommended as a sensitive biomarker of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).

In this study, a total of 230 patients with abdominal discomfort were prospectively enrolled and fecal samples were collected within 24 h before the endoscopic examinations. We show that fecal BAFF levels were significantly higher in patients with ulcerative  (median = 1549 pg/g, P < 0·0001), Crohn's disease (median = 735 pg/g, P < 0·0001), gastric cancer (median = 267 pg/g, P < 0·0001) and colorectal cancer (median = 533 pg/g, P < 0·0001) than those in healthy groups (median = 61 pg/g), while the values of which in patients with gastric polyps, colorectal polyps, esophagitis/gastritis/duodenitis and peptic ulcer were in the range of healthy individuals (P > 0·05). An optimal cut-off value at 219·5 pg/g of fecal BAFF produced sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values of 85, 91, 84 and 92%, respectively, for IBD or carcinoma. Our results therefore indicate a potential role for fecal BAFF as a sensitive screening parameter for IBD and gastrointestinal carcinoma, as well a useful tool to select patients with abdominal discomfort for further endoscopic examinations.© 2019 British Society for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30979002>Synbiotic Supplementation Containing Whole Plant Sugar Cane Fibre and Probiotic Spores Potentiates Protective Synergistic Effects in Mouse Model of IBD.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are a chronic inflammatory disorders with increasing global incidence. Synbiotic, which is a two-point approach carrying probiotic and prebiotic components in mitigating inflammation in IBD, is thought to be a pragmatic approach owing to the synergistic outcomes. In this study, the impacts of dietary supplementation with probiotic  MTCC5856 spores () and prebiotic whole plant sugar cane fibre (PSCF) was assessed using a murine model of IBD. Eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal chow diet supplemented with either , PSCF or its synbiotic combination. After seven days of supplementation,  was induced with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for seven days during the continuation of the supplemented diets. Synbiotic supplementation ameliorated disease activity index and histological score (-72%, 7.38, respectively), more effectively than either  (-47%, 10.1) and PSCF (-53%, 13.0) alone. Synbiotic supplementation also significantly ( < 0.0001) prevented the expression of tight junction proteins and modulated the altered serum IL-1β (-40%), IL-10 (+26%), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (-39%) levels. Synbiotic supplementations also raised the short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) profile more extensively compared to the unsupplemented DSS-control. The synbiotic health outcome effect of the probiotic and prebiotic combinations may be associated with a synergistic direct immune-regulating efficacy of the components, their ability to protect epithelial integrity, stimulation of probiotic spores by the prebiotic fibre, and/or with stimulation of greater levels of fermentation of fibres releasing SCFAs that mediate the reduction in colonic inflammation. Our model findings suggest synbiotic supplementation should be tested in clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30983435>A 30-year follow-up study of patients with Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome shows an association to inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p> Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS) is often classified under the term orofacial granulomatosis (OFG).

To evaluate the long-term outcomes of MRS patients, with specific interest in bowel-related symptoms.  This follow-up study consisted of adult patients with MRS - including the monosymptomatic form, cheilitis granulomatosa (CG) - who had participated in our earlier MRS study (diagnosed after 1995 in Helsinki University Hospital). A phone interview was conducted with 27 patients (77.1% of the patients from the earlier study) and included questions about orofacial symptoms, facial palsy, intestinal symptoms, concomitant illnesses, medications, possible food avoidances and family history. Stool samples were collected to measure faecal calprotectin, a surrogate marker for intestinal inflammation.  The median follow-up time from symptom onset was 30 years. Three (11.1%) patients had developed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); one CG patient developed CD, and two MRS patients with facial palsy developed ulcerative . In addition, several other patients reported intestinal symptoms, but the examination of faecal calprotectin did not indicate intestinal inflammation.  There was a connection between MRS and IBD - not only CD but ulcerative  as well.

We compared gene expression patterns between patients who did and did not enter endoscopic remission (absence of ulcerations at month 6 for patients with Crohn's disease or Mayo endoscopic subscore ≤1 at week 14 for patients with ulcerative ) and performed pathway analysis and cell deconvolution for training (n = 20) and validation (n = 11) datasets. Colon biopsies were also analyzed by immunohistochemistry. We validated a baseline gene expression pattern associated with endoscopic remission after vedolizumab therapy using 3 independent datasets (n = 66).We identified significant differences in expression levels of 44 genes between patients who entered remission after vedolizumab and those who did not; we found significant increases in leukocyte migration in colon tissues from patients who did not enter remission (P < .006). Deconvolution methods identified a significant enrichment of monocytes (P = .005), M1-macrophages (P = .05), and CD4+ T cells (P = .008) in colon tissues from patients who did not enter remission, whereas colon tissues from patients in remission had higher numbers of naïve  cells before treatment (P = .05). Baseline expression levels of PIWIL1, MAATS1, RGS13, and DCHS2 identified patients who did vs did not enter remission with 80% accuracy in the training set and 100% accuracy in validation dataset 1. We validated these findings in the 3 independent datasets by microarray, RNA sequencing and quantitative PCR analysis (P = .003). Expression levels of these 4 genes did not associate with response to anti-TNF agents. We confirmed the presence of proteins encoded by mRNAs using immunohistochemistry.We identified 4 genes whose baseline expression levels in colon tissues of patients with IBD associate with endoscopic remission after vedolizumab, but not anti-TNF, treatment. We validated this signature in 4 independent datasets and also at the protein level. Studies of these genes might provide insights into the mechanisms of vedolizumab.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

The chronic inﬂammatory process may predispose to atherosclerosis. The aim of the study was to assess the carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and its relation to subclinical atherosclerosis and to follow up cardiovascular complications in patients with UC.83 patients with proven UC in remission were enrolled in the study. 42 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were taken. Patients with known risk factors for atherosclerosis were excluded from the study. Baseline blood investigations along with C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and fasting lipid profile were done. CIMT was measured using -mode Doppler imaging study.The mean age of the UC patients was 37.06 ± 14.87 years. Left-sided  (45.8%) was the commonest type of presentation according to the extent of the disease. Mean CIMT (0.55 ± 0.17) was significantly higher in UC patients when compared to mean CIMT (0.46 ± 0.13) in the control group ( = 0.002). In Pearson correlation analysis, age, ESR, and CRP were positive and significantly correlated with CIMT. Multiple linear regression analysis (<sup>2</sup> = 0.18,  = 0.0026) revealed that age and CRP were significant independent predictors of mean CIMT. On following up for 6 months, 4 patients with UC had complications in the form of venous thrombosis.CIMT is a simple, noninvasive, reliable and objective auxiliary vascular parameter of structural alteration in UC patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554793>Human PI3Kγ deficiency and its microbiota-dependent mouse model reveal immunodeficiency and tissue immunopathology.</a></h2><p>Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-gamma (PI3Kγ) is highly expressed in leukocytes and is an attractive drug target for immune modulation. Different experimental systems have led to conflicting conclusions regarding inflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions of PI3Kγ. Here, we report a human patient with bi-allelic, loss-of-function mutations in PIK3CG resulting in absence of the p110γ catalytic subunit of PI3Kγ. She has a history of childhood-onset antibody defects, cytopenias, and T lymphocytic pneumonitis and , with reduced peripheral blood memory , memory CD8+ T, and regulatory T cells and increased CXCR3+ tissue-homing CD4 T cells. PI3Kγ-deficient macrophages and monocytes produce elevated inflammatory IL-12 and IL-23 in a GSK3α/β-dependent manner upon TLR stimulation. Pik3cg-deficient mice recapitulate major features of human disease after exposure to natural microbiota through co-housing with pet-store mice. Together, our results emphasize the physiological importance of PI3Kγ in restraining inflammation and promoting appropriate adaptive immune responses in both humans and mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31367672>Diagnostic utility of linked color imaging in the evaluation of colonic mucosal inflammation in ulcerative : a pilot study.</a></h2><p>  Recent studies recommend histological mucosal healing of intestinal tissue as a treatment goal in ulcerative  (UC). Linked-color imaging (LCI) is a new endoscopy system that enhances the color differences of the gastrointestinal mucosa. We investigated the efficacy of LCI in the evaluation of intestinal activity, including the histological activity in UC.   A total of 21 UC patients who were evaluated by the LASEREO system (FUJIFILM Co., Tokyo, Japan) were enrolled from August to December in 2016. All of the target points were observed by conventional white-light imaging (WLI) and LCI and biopsied from the region of interest in each view. We quantified the color tones of 73 biopsied points on WLI and LCI using the L*a** color value (WLI-L, WLI-a, WLI-, and LCI-L, LCI-a, LCI-). We then investigated the relationships among the L*a** color values, endoscopic findings, and histological healing.   The average LCI-a and LCI- values of patients with high mucosal activity disease were significantly higher than in those with mucosal healing (   < 0.01), and only LCI-a was significantly correlated with the score for histological healing. With regard to the other color values (LCI-L and all WLI values), there were no statistically significant differences in terms of average color value and correlation between patients with high mucosal activity and those with mucosal healing. In addition, the difference in the average color values with LCI and WLI was 7.1 and 3.1, respectively.   LCI is more useful than WLI for the visualization and evaluation of mucosal inflammation in UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31527031>Co-Infections of Two Strains of NDM-1 and OXA-232 Co-producing  in a Kidney Transplant Patient.</a></h2><p>We report here a fatal case of carbapenem-resistant  (CRKP) infections in a renal transplant patient without travel history in the past year, from whom 2 genetically different CRKP (ST14 and ST2497) strains carrying the same plasmids and anti-microbial resistance genes including  ,  ,  ,  and (D) were isolated from blood and abdominal cavity.

We investigated which markers are most relevant to assess intestinal permeability in UC patients and whether probiotics had an effect on these markers.In this twelve-week placebo-controlled randomized double-blind study, twenty-five subjects with UC in remission received either placebo or a multispecies probiotics. Samples of blood, urine, and faeces were taken at baseline, week 6, and week 12 to assess intestinal permeability and inflammation. Diaries and Bristol stool scale were kept to record stool frequency and consistency. Quality of life was scored from 32-224 with the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBD-Q).This group of UC patients, in clinical remission, did not show increased intestinal permeability at baseline of this study. During the study, no significant group or time effects were found for intestinal permeability measured by the 5-sugar absorption test, serum zonulin, and faecal zonulin. Likewise, the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), calprotectin, and the cytokines IFN, TNF, IL-6, and IL-10 were not significantly affected. Stool frequency and consistency were not significantly affected either. The IBD-Q score, 194 for the probiotics group and 195 for the placebo group, remained unaffected. Correlations were tested between all outcomes; urinary sucrose excretion was significantly correlated with serum zonulin ( = 0.62) and faecal calprotectin ( = 0.55). Faecal zonulin was not significantly correlated with any of the other markers.Serum zonulin may be a more relevant biomarker of intestinal permeability than faecal zonulin, due to its correlation with other biomarkers of intestinal permeability. UC patients in remission did not show an effect of the probiotic treatment or a change in gut permeability. This should not discourage further studies because effects might be present during active disease or shortly after a flare up.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145641>Daphnetin ameliorates experimental  by modulating microbiota composition and T/T17 balance.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are characterized by chronic pathologies associated with extensive gut dysbiosis and intestinal inflammation. Hence, endeavors to improve the inflammatory pathology by manipulating gut microbiota are ongoing. Daphnetin (DAPH) is a coumarin derivative extracted from  with anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory properties that has been widely used in treating inflammatory disorders. Herein, we showed that DAPH remarkably alleviated experimental  by reducing colonic inflammation, improving colonic integrity, and reestablishing immune and metabolic homeostasis in the inflicted intestines. Our analysis showed that DAPH modified the composition of gut microbiota and altered the metabolic profiles in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice. In particular, this agent significantly elevated the abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing gut microbiota, causatively related with the enhanced development of T cells and the reduced proinflammatory T17 cell differentiation. More critically, the protective effect of DAPH was shown to be transmissible among colitic mice through cohousing or fecal microbiota transplantation, further substantiating the importance of SCFA-producing gut microbiota in DAPH action. We thus for the first time reveal the potential of DAPH in resetting the gut microbiome and reestablishing immune homeostasis in colitic mice, which may have clinical implications for treating IBD.-Ji, J., Ge, X., Chen, Y., Zhu, ., Wu, Q., Zhang, J., Shan, J., Cheng, H., Shi, L.

Risk groups include very young, elderly, transplant recipient, and immunocompromised individuals. HCMV may cause retinitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, esophagitis, , pneumonia, neonatal infection sequelae, inflammatory, and age-related diseases. With an arsenal of genes in its large genome dedicated to host immune evasion, HCMV can block intrinsic cellular defenses and interfere with cellular immune responses. HCMV also encodes chemokines, chemokine receptors, and cytokines. Therefore, genes involved in human viral defense mechanisms and those encoding proteins targeted by the CMV proteins are candidates for host control of CMV infection and reactivation. Although still few in number, host genetic studies are producing valuable insights into biological processes involved in HCMV pathogenesis and HCMV-related diseases. For example, genetic variants in the immunoglobulin GM light chain can influence the antibody responsiveness to CMV glycoprotein  and modify risk of HCMV-related diseases. Moreover, CMV infection following organ transplantation has been associated with variants in genes encoding toll-like receptors (TLRs), programmed death-1 (), and interleukin-12p40 (). A KIR haplotype (2DS4+) is proposed to be protective for CMV activation among hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. Polymorphisms in the interferon lambda 3/4 () region are shown to influence susceptibility to CMV replication among solid organ transplant patients. Interestingly, the  region is also associated with AIDS-related CMV retinitis susceptibility in HIV-infected patients. Likewise, interleukin-10 receptor 1 () variants are shown to influence CMV retinitis development in patients with AIDS. Results from genome-wide association studies suggest a possible role for microtubule network and retinol metabolism in anti-CMV antibody response. Nevertheless, further genetic epidemiological studies with large cohorts, functional studies on the numerous HCMV genes, and immune response to chronic and latent states of infection that contribute to HCMV persistence are clearly necessary to elucidate the genetic mechanisms of CMV infection, reactivation, and pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189465>TREM-1-dependent M1 macrophage polarization restores intestinal epithelium damaged by DSS-induced  by activating IL-22-producing innate lymphoid cells.</a></h2><p>Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) is highly expressed on macrophages in inflamed intestines and reportedly promotes inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by augmenting pro-inflammatory responses. To study the mechanism mediated by TREM-1 on macrophages, we generated an independent TREM-1 deficient mouse.Acute  was induced in C57BL/6 and TREM-1-deficient mice by the administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Colonic lamina propria immune cell composition and cytokines were analyzed. An innate lymphoid cell (ILC) co-culture experiment with macrophages was used to analyze IL-22 levels. Exogenous IL-22 and TREM-1-expressing macrophages were supplied to TREM-1-deficient mice for examining their effects on intestinal barrier integrity.In inflamed colons, TREM-1 loss compromised the activation of ILC3 and their production of IL-22, which is required for intestinal barrier integrity. ILC3-mediated IL-22 production depends on IL-1β secreted by M1-polarized macrophages, and we found that TREM-1 deficiency results in a decreased number of IL-1β producing-M1 macrophages in colons exposed to DSS. Accordingly, DSS-mediated damage was ameliorated by supplying exogenous IL-22 and TREM-1-expressing macrophages to TREM-1-deficient mice.TREM-1 plays a crucial role in regulating IL-22 production by ILC3 through modulating M1-macrophage polarization during DSS-induced acute .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31019062>IL-21 Enhances the Development of -Associated Colon Cancer: Possible Involvement of Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase Expression.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases are known to be the origin of -associated colon cancer (CAC). We previously reported that dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  is exacerbated in mouse-IL-21-isoform transgenic (Tg) mice. In this study, we assessed the CAC development induced by azoxymethane (AOM) and DSS in our Tg mice. AOM-DSS-induced tumor development was dramatically increased in the Tg mice compared with wild-type mice. IL-21 is known to enhance activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) expression in  cells and induce Ab class switching. In contrast, the AID expression in cells other than  cells initiates tumor development in many tissues. Therefore, we investigated whether IL-21 induces the AID expression in the large intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) during CAC development. AID gene and protein expression was increased in the IECs of AOM-DSS- or DSS-treated Tg mice compared with those of wild-type mice. Furthermore, we confirmed IL-21 induced AID gene expression in the purified IECs ex vivo. The present study also showed IL-21R gene expression in unstimulated wild-type mouse IECs, and this gene expression was augmented by TNF-α stimulation. The IL-21R expression and IL-21-induced AID gene activation were further confirmed in the Colon-38 cell line.

GCs are also widely used in anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressant drugs. GCs are synthesized by the adrenal cortex as part of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and also by intestinal epithelial cells, among other peripheral sites. GCs are one of the main therapy choices for the exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease, but they are not useful to prolong remission, and development of tolerance with secondary treatment failure is frequent. Thus, GC actions at the intestinal epithelial level are of great importance, both physiologically and pharmacologically. We generated a tamoxifen-inducible nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (NR3C1) mouse model to study the effects of GCs on epithelial cells .  deletion in epithelial cells of the small intestine and colon was associated with limited colonic inflammation at 1 wk postdeletion, involving augmented epithelial proliferation and mucus production, plus local and systemic immune/inflammatory changes. This phenotype regressed substantially, but not completely, after 2 wk. The mechanism may involve augmented inflammatory signaling by epithelial cells or defective barrier function. We conclude that the epithelial GC receptor plays a significant role in colonic homeostasis in basal conditions, but its deficiency can be compensated in the short term.

Numerous articles have been published on biologicals, which complicates the decision making process on the use of the most appropriate biologic for a given immune-mediated disease. This systematic review is the first of a series of articles assessing the safety and efficacy of  cell-targeting biologics for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases.  To evaluate rituximab's safety and efficacy for the treatment of immune-mediated disorders compared to placebo, conventional treatment, or other biologics.  The PRISMA checklist guided the reporting of the data. We searched the PubMed database between 4 October 2016 and 26 July 2018 concentrating on immune-mediated disorders.  The literature search identified 19,665 articles. After screening titles and abstracts against the inclusion and exclusion criteria and assessing full texts, 105 articles were finally included in a narrative synthesis.  Rituximab is both safe and effective for the treatment of acquired angioedema with C1-inhibitor deficiency, ANCA-associated vasculitis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Behçet's disease, bullous pemphigoid, Castleman's disease, cryoglobulinemia, Goodpasture's disease, IgG4-related disease, immune thrombocytopenia, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, nephrotic syndrome, neuromyelitis optica, pemphigus, rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathy, and systemic sclerosis. Conversely, rituximab failed to show an effect for antiphospholipid syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, IgA nephropathy, inflammatory myositis, primary-progressive multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and ulcerative .

Head-to-head trials of these therapies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are lacking.In a phase 3b, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized trial conducted at 245 centers in 34 countries, we compared vedolizumab with adalimumab in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative  to determine whether vedolizumab was superior. Previous exposure to a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor other than adalimumab was allowed in up to 25% of patients. The patients were assigned to receive infusions of 300 mg of vedolizumab on day 1 and at weeks 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, and 46 (plus injections of placebo) or subcutaneous injections of 40 mg of adalimumab, with a total dose of 160 mg at week 1, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg every 2 weeks thereafter until week 50 (plus infusions of placebo). Dose escalation was not permitted in either group. The primary outcome was clinical remission at week 52 (defined as a total score of ≤2 on the Mayo scale [range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease] and no subscore >1 [range, 0 to 3] on any of the four Mayo scale components). To control for type I error, efficacy outcomes were analyzed with a hierarchical testing procedure, with the variables in the following order: clinical remission, endoscopic improvement (subscore of 0 to 1 on the Mayo endoscopic component), and corticosteroid-free remission at week 52.A total of 769 patients underwent randomization and received at least one dose of vedolizumab (383 patients) or adalimumab (386 patients). At week 52, clinical remission was observed in a higher percentage of patients in the vedolizumab group than in the adalimumab group (31.3% vs. 22.5%; difference, 8.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5 to 15.0; P = 0.006), as was endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs. 27.7%; difference, 11.9 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.3 to 18.5; P<0.001). Corticosteroid-free clinical remission occurred in 12.6% of the patients in the vedolizumab group and in 21.8% in the adalimumab group (difference, -9.3 percentage points; 95% CI, -18.9 to 0.4). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of infection were 23.4 and 34.6 events per 100 patient-years with vedolizumab and adalimumab, respectively, and the corresponding rates for serious infection were 1.6 and 2.2 events per 100 patient-years.In this trial involving patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative , vedolizumab was superior to adalimumab with respect to achievement of clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, but not corticosteroid-free clinical remission.

While the genotoxic function of PMNs and its implications in carcinogenesis have been primarily associated with oxidative stress, recent work by Butin-Israeli and colleagues has defined a novel mechanism where PMN-derived microparticles through the delivery and activity of specific miRNAs promoted formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs), and in parallel, suppressed DSB repair through the downregulation of lamin B1 and Rad51. Respective downregulation of these two proteins compromised the nuclear envelope and high-fidelity repair by homologous recombination, increasing DSB accumulation and aneuploidy.

Binding of hsa-miR-375 to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was verified by the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Changes in the viability and apoptosis in Caco-2 cells influenced by hsa-miR-375 were examined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The regulatory effect of hsa-miR-375 on the intestinal epithelial barrier was examined by detecting transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and lucifer yellow flux. Relative levels of TLR4, nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin and inflammatory factors in Caco-2 cells were detected by qRT-PCR, Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Hsa-miR-375 was downregulated in intestinal mucosa tissues of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC). Knockdown of hsa-miR-375 decreased viability and TEER, but elevated apoptotic rate and lucifer yellow flux. Overexpression of hsa-miR-375 achieved the opposite trends. TLR4 was the direct downstream of hsa-miR-375, and its level was negatively mediated by hsa-miR-375. In addition, TLR4 level in Caco-2 cells was upregulated after LPS induction, while hsa-miR-375 level was unchangeable. Knockdown of hsa-miR-375 upregulated NF-κ and pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8, and downregulated ZO-1, occludin and anti-inflammatory factor IL-10.Hsa-miR-375 is involved in the pathogenesis of IBD by upregulating TLR4 and inducing NF-κ activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31203691>Endoscopic follow-up and therapeutic attitude after ileocolonic resection in a nationwide Spanish cohort of Crohn's disease patients: the Practicrohn study.</a></h2><p>: In patients with Crohn's disease (CD), endoscopic recurrence precedes clinical recurrence after ileocolonic resection.

Initial goals of care aimed to achieve the induction and maintenance of clinical remission. The advent of novel treat-to-target approaches using patient stratification, early introduction of immunosuppressants and rapid escalation to biologics or early use of combination therapy has refocused the goals of care toward the achievement of mucosal healing. This is in an attempt to preserve intestinal function, decrease hospitalization and surgery rates and improve the quality of life of affected patients. Cellular therapeutics for the treatment of IBD offers an unprecedented opportunity to change the current paradigm from single-targeted to systems-targeted therapy, trying to dampen the whole inflammatory cascade instead of a only molecule. Therefore, as we move forward, the importance of designing informative and possibly adaptive trial designs, standardizing methodologies, harmonizing goals of therapy and evaluating methods cannot be underemphasized. In this article, we review the current literature on the application of mesenchymal stromal cells for the treatment of IBD in an effort to establish a consensus on designing efficient and consistent clinical trials for the intravenous use of this cellular therapy in IBD.Copyright © 2019.

The region is highly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), largely through genome-wide association studies (GWAS).To review the role of HLA in immune function, summarise data on risk/protective HLA genotypes for IBD, discuss the role of HLA in IBD pathogenesis, treatment and examine limitations that might be addressed by future research.An organised search strategy was used to collate articles describing HLA genes in IBD, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative .All classical HLA genes with variation (including HLA-A, , C, DRB1, DQA1, DQB1, DPA1 and DPB1) harbour IBD-associated genotypes. The most implicated gene is HLA-DRB1, with HLA-DRB1*03:01 the most associated risk allele in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative . Elucidating precise disease associations is challenging due to high linkage disequilibrium between HLA genotypes. The mechanisms by which risk alleles cause disease are multifactorial, with the best evidence indicating structural and electrostatic alteration impacting antigen binding and downstream signalling. Adverse medication events have been associated with HLA genotypes including with thiopurines (pancreatitis) and anti-TNF agents (antibody formation).The HLA complex is associated with multiple risk/protective alleles for IBD. Future research utilising long-read technology, ascertainment of zygosity and integration in disease modelling will improve the functional understanding and clinical translation of genetic findings.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31074304>Impact of phytosterols on liver and distal colon metabolome in experimental murine  model: an explorative study.</a></h2><p>Phytosterols are known to reduce plasma cholesterol levels and thereby reduce cardiovascular risk. Studies conducted on human and animal models have demonstrated that these compounds have also anti-inflammatory effects. Recently, an experimental  model (dextran sulphate sodium-induced) has shown that pre-treatment with phytosterols decreases infiltration of inflammatory cells and accelerates mucosal healing.

In particular, an unsupervised gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and NMR based metabolomics approach was employed to identify the metabolic pathways perturbed by the dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) insult (i.e. Krebs cycle, carbohydrate, amino acids, and nucleotide metabolism). Interestingly, phytosterols were able to restore the homeostatic equilibrium of the hepatic and colonic metabolome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487251>[Refractory  by Clostridium difficile treated with fecal microbiota transplant].</a></h2><p>Clostridium difficile infection is an increasingly recognized cause of diarrhea in inpatients, frequently associated to high mortality.

We used bivariate and multivariable analyses to identify predictors of inadequate response to budesonide MMX.Ninety-six patients were treated with budesonide MMX. Before initiation of budesonide MMX 55, 35, and 8% were on aminosalicylate, immunomodulator, and/or biologic therapy or no therapy for UC respectively. While 54% (52/96) of patients responded to budesonide MMX, 46% (44/96) required a transition to prednisone. Patients who required transition to prednisone were more likely to be male (39 vs. 19%,  = 0.035) and younger at the time of diagnosis (median age 23.5 vs. 29.0 years,  = 0.034). Age ≤29 years at diagnosis (adjusted OR 3.10, 95% CI 1.21-7.95) and male sex (adjusted OR 2.96, 95% CI 1.12-7.77) but not concomitant therapy with biologics and/or immunomodulators or disease extent were associated with increased odds of requiring transition to prednisone.Budesonide MMX is effective in more than half of patients with mild-to-moderate UC.

There is lack of data on the incidence of corticosteroid-induced mood changes in this patient population, which may be underappreciated by healthcare providers in clinical practice and interfere with optimal care. This study aimed to determine the rate of mood changes in this patient population.In this prospective observational study, adult outpatients treated with prednisone for inflammatory bowel disease flares were considered for inclusion. Participants completed validated questionnaires (Beck Depression Inventory-II and Activation Subscale of Internal State Scale version two) before starting prednisone, after two weeks of prednisone, and at the end of prednisone taper to assess for mood changes. Harvey-Bradshaw Index and Simple Clinical  Activity Index were used to monitor clinical disease activity.Fifty-three subjects were included in the analyses. The rate of mood change after two weeks of prednisone was 49.1%, primarily driven by increase in mood towards (hypo)mania. Younger age was an independent risk factor. Mood state returned to pretreatment level at the end of treatment. There was no correlation between clinical disease activity change and mood change.Oral prednisone for inflammatory bowel disease flare is associated with high rate of mood change. As prednisone is a critical part of induction therapy, ways to minimize this adverse event must be studied. For now, healthcare providers should inform patients and monitor closely for this adverse event.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559298>Fecal microbiota transplantation as an effective initial therapy for pancreatitis complicated with severe  infection: A case report.</a></h2><p>Moderately severe acute pancreatitis (MSAP) is a critical form of acute pancreatitis that is related with high morbidity and mortality. Severe  infection (sCDI) is a serious and rare nosocomial diarrheal complication, especially in MSAP patients. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective treatment for refractory and recurrent CDI (rCDI). However, knowledge regarding the initial use of FMT in patients suffering from sCDI is limited.Here, we report an MSAP patient complicated with sCDI who was treated by FMT as a first-line therapy. The patient was a 51-year-old man who suffered from diarrhea in his course of acute pancreatitis. An enzyme immunoassay was performed to detect toxins, and the result was positive for toxin-producing  and toxin  and negative for  ribotype 027. The colonoscopy revealed pseudomembranous . Due to these findings, sCDI was our primary consideration. Because the patient provided informed consent for FMT treatment, we initially treated the patient by FMT rather than metronidazole. Diarrhea resolved within 5 d after FMT. The patient remained asymptomatic, and the follow-up colonoscopy performed 40 d after discharge showed a complete recovery. Our case is the first reported in China.This case explores the possibilities of initially using FMT to treat severe CDI. Moreover, FMT may become a critical component of the treatment for severe CDI in MSAP patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665283>Deficient Resident Memory T-Cell and Cd8 T-Cell Response to Commensals in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Aims: The intestinal microbiota is closely associated with resident memory lymphocytes in mucosal tissue. We sought to understand how acquired cellular and humoral immunity to the microbiota differ in health versus inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Resident memory T-cells (Trm) in colonic biopsies and local antibody responses to intraepithelial microbes were analyzed. Systemic antigen-specific immune T- and -cell memory to a panel of commensal microbes was assessed.Systemically, healthy blood showed CD4 and occasional CD8 memory T-cell responses to selected intestinal bacteria but few memory -cell responses. In IBD, CD8 memory T-cell responses decreased although -cell responses and circulating plasmablasts increased. Possibly secondary to loss of systemic CD8 T-cell responses in IBD, dramatically reduced numbers of mucosal CD8+ Trm and γδ T-cells were observed. IgA responses to intraepithelial bacteria were increased. Colonic Trm expressed CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, characteristic of regulatory T-cells. Cytokines/factors required for Trm differentiation were identified, and in vitro-generated Trm expressed regulatory T-cell function via CD39. Cognate interaction between T-cells and dendritic cells induced T-bet expression in dendritic cells, a key mechanism in regulating cell-mediated mucosal responses.A previously unrecognized imbalance exists between cellular and humoral immunity to the microbiota in IBD, with loss of mucosal T-cell-mediated barrier immunity and uncontrolled antibody responses. Regulatory function of Trm may explain their association with intestinal health. Promoting Trm and their interaction with dendritic cells rather than immunosuppression may reinforce tissue immunity, improve barrier function and prevent -cell dysfunction in microbiota-associated disease and IBD etiology.© European Crohn’s and  Organisation 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31165225>Oral delivery of a Lactococcus lactis strain secreting bovine lactoferricin-lactoferrampin alleviates the development of acute  in mice.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative  (UC) is a chronic relapsing disease. Treatment of UC would benefit from specific targeting of therapeutics to the intestine. Previous studies have demonstrated that bovine lactoferricin and lactoferrampin have bactericidal, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. Here, we investigated whether oral administration of a bovine lactoferricin-lactoferrampin (LFCA)-encoding Lactococcus lactis (LL-LFCA) strain could alleviate experimental . LFCA derived from LL-LFCA inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in vitro. In mice, administration of LL-LFCA decreased the disease activity index and attenuated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced body weight loss and colon shortening. LL-LFCA treatment also ameliorated DSS-induced colon damage, inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration, significantly decreased myeloperoxidase activity, and ameliorated DSS-induced disruption of intestinal permeability and tight junctions. In addition, 16S rDNA sequencing showed that LL-LFCA reversed DSS-induced gut dysbiosis. The production of proinflammatory mediators in serum and the colon was also reduced by administration of LL-LFCA. In vitro, LFCA derived from LL-LFCA decreased the messenger RNA expression of proinflammatory factors. The underlying mechanisms may involve inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) pathway. The results demonstrate that LL-LFCA ameliorates DSS-induced intestinal injury in mice, suggesting that LL-LFCA might be an effective drug for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569788>Anti-Inflammatory Mechanisms of Koreanaside A, a Lignan Isolated from the Flower of , against LPS-Induced Macrophage Activation and DSS-Induced  Mice: The Crucial Role of AP-1, NF-κ, and JAK/STAT Signaling.</a></h2><p>The current treatment options for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are unsatisfactory. Therefore, novel and safer therapies are needed. We previously reported that koreanaside A (KA) showed high radical scavenging activity and suppressed vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in its anti-inflammatory effect have not been reported. KA inhibited pro-inflammatory mediators such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E (PGE). KA inhibited the production and mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) induced by LPS. KA downregulated the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent inflammatory gene expressions in the MyD88-overexpressed cells. KA suppressed the LPS-induced transcriptional and DNA-binding activities of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ). KA was found to inhibit the phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1/2 (JAK1/2) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 1/3 (STAT1/3). In DSS-induced  mice, KA relieved the symptoms of  by suppressing inflammatory cell infiltration, restoring tight junction (TJ)- and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related protein expression, and inactivating AP-1, NF-κ, and STAT1/3.

However, the extent and targets of immunoglobulin (Ig) A versus IgG responses to gut bacteria in IBD and its association with IBD severity is not well understood. Here, we address this by analyzing fecal samples from Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative  (UC), and Non-IBD patients by flow cytometry for the frequency of bacteria that were endogenously bound with IgA and/or IgG. Assessment of IBD patients from two geographically distinct cohorts revealed increased percentages of IgA- and IgG-bound fecal bacteria compared to non-IBD controls. Notably, the two major subsets of IBD showed distinct patterns of Ig-bound bacteria, with CD activity associated with increases in both IgA and IgG-bound bacteria, whereas UC activity correlated only with increases in IgG-bound bacteria. Analysis of the flow sorted Ig-bound bacterial repertoire by 16S rDNA sequencing revealed taxa that were Ig-bound specifically in IBD. Notably, this included bacteria that are also thought to reside in the oral pharynx, including , and  species. These data show that the pattern of IgA and IgG binding to fecal bacteria is distinct in UC and CD. In addition, the frequency of Ig-bound fecal bacteria may have potential as a non-invasive biomarker for disease activity. Finally, our results support the hypothesis that immune responses to oral pharyngeal bacteria may play an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31366623>Design and characterization of α1-antitrypsin variants for treatment of contact system-driven thromboinflammation.</a></h2><p>The contact system produces the inflammatory peptide bradykinin and contributes to experimental thrombosis. C1 esterase-inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency or gain-of-function mutations in Factor XII (FXII) cause hereditary angioedema, a life-threatening tissue swelling disease. C1INH is a relatively weak contact system enzyme inhibitor. Although α1-antitrypsin (α1AT) does not naturally inhibit contact system enzymes, a human mutation (M358R; α1AT-Pittsburgh) changes it into a powerful broad-spectrum enzyme inhibitor. It blocks the contact system, but also thrombin and activated protein C (APC), making it an unattractive candidate for therapeutic contact system blockade. We adapted the reactive center loop of α1AT-Pittsburgh (AIPR/S) to overcome these obstacles. Two α1AT variants (SMTR/S and SLLR/S) strongly inhibit plasma kallikrein, activated FXII and plasmin. α1AT-SMTR/S no longer inhibits thrombin, but residually inhibits APC. In contrast, α1AT-SLLR/S residually inhibits thrombin, but no longer APC. Additional modification at the P1' position (S→V) eliminates residual inhibition of thrombin and APC for both variants, while retaining their properties as contact system inhibitors. Both α1AT-SMTR/V and -SLLR/V are superior to C1INH in reducing bradykinin production in plasma. Owing to their capacity to selectively block contact system-driven coagulation, both variants block vascular occlusion in an  model for arterial thrombosis. Furthermore, both variants block acute carrageenan-induced tissue edema in mice. Finally, α1AT-SLLR/V, our most powerful candidate, suppresses epithelial leakage of the gut in a mouse model of . Our findings confirm that redesign of α1AT strongly alters its inhibitory behavior and can be used for the treatment of contact system-mediated thrombosis and inflammation.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Hematology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481750>Small heat shock protein CRYAB inhibits intestinal mucosal inflammatory responses and protects barrier integrity through suppressing IKKβ activity.</a></h2><p>Alpha -crystallin (CRYAB) is an important member of the small heat shock protein family, and plays a protective and therapeutic role in neurological inflammation. CRYAB expression was assessed in cultured HT29 and Caco-2 cells and inflamed mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and  models in mice. Lentivirus-overexpressing and CRSIPR/Cas9 systems were used in different cells to upregulate and silence CRYAB expression, respectively. Cell permeable recombined fusion protein TAT-CRYAB was injected intraperitoneally into dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced  in mice to assess its anti-inflammatory effects. CRYAB was found to be significantly decreased in the inflamed mucosa from IBD patients and DSS-induced  in mice, and negatively correlated with the levels of TNF-α and IL-6, respectively. Enforced expression of CRYAB suppressed expression of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8) via inhibiting the IKK complex formation, whereas lack of CRYAB expression markedly enhanced proinflammatory responses. Consistently, administration of TAT-CRYAB fusion protein significantly alleviated DSS- or TNBS-induced  in mice and protected intestinal barrier integrity.

Rapidly increasing clinical literatures confirmed the truth of the benefits of FMT on recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI) and inflammatory bowel disease. This article retrospectively reviewed nine cases (four cases had ulcerative  [UC], five cases had rCDI) who received FMT in Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital from April 2016 to November 2018. We summarized the procedure including donor selection, fecal materials preparation, transplantation delivery methods, and clinical outcomes. All of the four UC cases got clinical improvement and four rCDI cases achieved clinical remission after FMT. The other one rCDI case remained positive stool Toxin A+ result after FMT, and got remission after salvage treatment with fidaxomicin. FMT is considered to be a well-tolerated adjuvant treatment for UC and effective salvage treatment for rCDI in our initial experience. Multiple infusions of FMT in UC and rCDI might have exceptional clinical efficiency, and enteral tube insertion could be a useful method to reach this goal and make multiple sessions of FMT easier.© 2019 The Authors.

Despite the advantages in the management of UC over the past few decades, much less has been achieved in the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease where colonoscopy remains the "gold standard" method. Therefore, a non-invasive marker correlating with MH is being sought [14]. Non-invasive markers have the potential to avoid invasive diagnostic tests and inhibit potential complications. Although several noninvasive and easily accessible biomarkers for UC are available, their sensitivity and specificity are not adequate to be used as single markers and do not overrule the need for endoscopic evaluation. Consequently, there is still need for new markers of intestinal inflammation in UC. In the current review Based on a literature search using PubMed, we reviewed eight new potential markers in UC studied mainly in the last five years: trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), leucine-rich Α-2 glycoprotein (LRG), high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), soluble ST2 (sST2),  cell-activating factor (BAFF), annexin A1 (ANXA1), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

While the disease takes an acute self-limited course in immunocompetent individuals, under immunocompromised conditions chronic hepatitis E might develop. The histology of chronic hepatitis E has not been described in detail systematically.Liver biopsies from 19 immunosuppressed patients with chronic hepatitis E were collected: 17 were organ transplant recipients, one had a CD4-deficiency and one had received steroid therapy because of ulcerative . Biopsies were processed with standard stains. Evaluation of histologic activity and fibrosis was performed according to Ishak. Additionally, immunohistochemistry with antibodies directed against open reading frame 2 and 3 of the virus was performed and liver biopsies were tested for hepatitis E virus RNA.Biochemical data showed an increase in alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transferase and total bilirubin. Histopathology displayed typical features of chronic hepatitis with mild to moderate activity. The number of polymorphonuclear leucocytes was considerably increased and all patients had a florid cholangitis that presented as a destructive form in five of them. Hepatocytes and bile duct epithelia stained positive for hepatitis E virus by immunohistochemistry.Chronic hepatitis E in immunocompromised individuals runs a similar course as hepatitis  and C and shows similar histopathology. However, the presence of destructive cholangitis in some cases accompanied by an increased number of polymorphonuclear leucocytes is markedly different. Immunohistochemically the virus is present in bile duct epithelia, seemingly the cause for cholangitis.© 2019 The Authors.

Liver-related issues, including cirrhosis and variceal haemorrhage, are a leading cause of early mortality in individuals with chronic forms of ASMD. Due to the rarity of this lysosomal storage disorder, there can be a lack of awareness that adults with chronic ASMD disease are at significant risk of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and variceal bleeding. This case highlights an unusual presentation of recurrent variceal bleeding in an adult with cirrhosis and portal hypertension due to chronic visceral ASMD.A patient with severe splenomegaly was diagnosed with ASMD at age of 25. At age 64 they had multiple hospital admissions for hematochezia (originally diagnosed as ischemic ) accompanied by hypotension (blood pressure 91/45 mmHg), anemia (hemoglobin 8.5g/dL, ref 12-16; INR 1.4, ref ≤1.2), and mild renal insufficiency (creatinine 1.33mg/dL, ref 0.51-0.95). Colonoscopy did not reveal a source of bleeding. Computerized tomography scanning imaging showed diffuse venous collaterals and ascites. Arteriographies during subsequent episodes of bleeding were negative for active arterial intestinal bleeding. Recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding was found to originate from a varicose vein cluster connected to the right iliac vein and the superior mesenteric vein, located in the submucosa of a small intestinal loop. Multiple varices were secondary to portal hypertension in the context of cirrhosis. The patient died from recurrent variceal bleeding that exacerbated liver failure worsened by pneumonia and hypovolemic and septic shock.The variceal bleeding in this patient was atypical in that it originated from venous collaterals bleeding into the small intestine rather than the more typical gastroesophageal varices observed in ASMD. With long standing liver dysfunction and gradual development of portal hypertension, intestinal varices rather than occult intestinal bleeding due to ischemia should be considered in ASMD patients presenting with either hematochezia or hematemesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31024858> Outer Protein  Suppresses  Development via Protecting Cell From Necroptosis.</a></h2><p> effectors translocated into epithelial cells contribute to the pathogenesis of infection.

In this study, we uncovered a role for  outer protein  (SopB) in modulating necroptosis to facilitate bacteria escape epithelial cell and spread to systemic sites through a -induced  model. Mice infected with SopB deleted strain Δ displayed increased severity to , reduced mucin expression and increased bacterial translocation.  study, we found there was an increased goblet cell necroptosis following Δ infection. Consistently, mice infected with Δ had a strong upregulation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) phosphorylation. Deletion of MLKL rescued severity of tissue inflammatory, improved mucin2 expression and abolished the increased bacterial translocation in mice infected with Δ. Intriguingly, the expression of  in LS174T cells was downregulated. The temporally regulated SopB expression potentially switched the role from epithelial cell invasion to bacterial transmission. Collectively, these results indicated a role for SopB in modulating the onset of necroptosis to increased bacteria pathogenesis and translocated to systemic sites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553833>Ustekinumab as Induction and Maintenance Therapy for Ulcerative .</a></h2><p>The efficacy of ustekinumab, an antagonist of the p40 subunit of interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, as induction and maintenance therapy in patients with ulcerative  is unknown.We evaluated ustekinumab as 8-week induction therapy and 44-week maintenance therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative . A total of 961 patients were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous induction dose of ustekinumab (either 130 mg [320 patients] or a weight-range-based dose that approximated 6 mg per kilogram of body weight [322]) or placebo (319). Patients who had a response to induction therapy 8 weeks after administration of intravenous ustekinumab were randomly assigned again to receive subcutaneous maintenance injections of 90 mg of ustekinumab (either every 12 weeks [172 patients] or every 8 weeks [176]) or placebo (175). The primary end point in the induction trial (week 8) and the maintenance trial (week 44) was clinical remission (defined as a total score of ≤2 on the Mayo scale [range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease] and no subscore >1 [range, 0 to 3] on any of the four Mayo scale components).The percentage of patients who had clinical remission at week 8 among patients who received intravenous ustekinumab at a dose of 130 mg (15.6%) or 6 mg per kilogram (15.5%) was significantly higher than that among patients who received placebo (5.3%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Among patients who had a response to induction therapy with ustekinumab and underwent a second randomization, the percentage of patients who had clinical remission at week 44 was significantly higher among patients assigned to 90 mg of subcutaneous ustekinumab every 12 weeks (38.4%) or every 8 weeks (43.8%) than among those assigned to placebo (24.0%) (P = 0.002 and P<0.001, respectively). The incidence of serious adverse events with ustekinumab was similar to that with placebo. Through 52 weeks of exposure, there were two deaths (one each from acute respiratory distress syndrome and hemorrhage from esophageal varices) and seven cases of cancer (one each of prostate, colon, renal papillary, and rectal cancer and three nonmelanoma skin cancers) among 825 patients who received ustekinumab and no deaths and one case of cancer (testicular cancer) among 319 patients who received placebo.Ustekinumab was more effective than placebo for inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative .

The interaction between follicular helper T cells (Tfh) and follicular regulatory T cells (Tfr) is critical to the induction and regulation of antibody production. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of Tfr cells in UC patients. We gated circulating Tfr cells as CD4CXCR5CD25CD127 T cells, of which approximately 73% on average were Foxp3. The circulating Tfh (CD4CXCR5CD25) cells from control subjects and UC patients presented a comparable capacity to induce IgM production from naive  cells and to mediate class switching to IgG. Tfr cells significantly reduced Tfh-mediated  cell help in both healthy controls and UC patients in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the suppression capacity of Tfr cells was significantly lower in UC patients than in healthy controls. Subsequently, we found that the frequency of CTLA-4-expressing cells was only slightly lower in UC patients, but the MFI of CTLA-4, however, was markedly lower in UC patients. CTLA-4 blockade nearly abrogated Tfr-mediated suppression of IgM, and significantly reduced Tfr-mediated suppression of IgG. Moreover, CTLA-4 blockade removed the relative advantage of Tfr suppression capacity in healthy controls compared to UC patients. Overall, this study demonstrated that CTLA-4 was required for Tfr-mediated suppression of  cell help, but was expressed at lower levels in UC patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This retrospective study aimed to describe the pathological findings of fatal parasite-induced enteritis and typhlocolitis caused by cyathostominae, Eimeria leuckarti, Balantidium coli, and Strongyloides westeri in horses. The records of parasite-induced intestinal lesions in horses necropsied in Southern Brazil between 2005 and 2017 were reviewed. Ten horses had fatal parasitic enteritis and/or typhlocolitis, and the main causes were: cyathostominae typhlocolitis (6/10), E. leuckarti enteritis (1/10), S. westeri enteritis (1/10), . coli  related to cyathostominae (1/10), and infection by multiple agents (1/10). Cyathostominae typhlocolitis showed marked mucosal thickening, with multifocal elevated nodules containing tangled filiform parasites. Microscopic examination revealed that the mucosa and submucosa had encysted parasitic structures surrounded by eosinophilic and granulomatous inflammation. E. leuckarti enteritis was microscopically characterized by macrogamonts, microgamonts, and oocysts inside the host cells. S. westeri enteritis showed microscopic atrophy of the villi with numerous mucosal encysted parasitic structures. . coli typhlocolitis showed severe diffuse mucosal reddening, with microscopic superficial mucosal necrosis associated with multiple protozoan trophozoites.

Recently, our group has demonstrated increased UTR expression in both human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines and adenomatous polyps, as well as in colon carcinoma samples if compared to healthy colon samples of the same patients. We also showed that an UTR agonist induced an increase in colon adenocarcinoma cell growth in vitro, whereas the UTR block with a specific antagonist caused an inhibition of their growth and an inhibition of about 50% of both motility and cell invasion. Ulcerative  (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) associated with an increased baseline risk for colon cancer compared with the general population, and this risk is mostly attributed to chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation. This risk increases along with the duration of the disease, as demonstrated by many studies. There are no UTR expression data related to UC, and we therefore evaluated UTR expression in ill colon biopsies and in healthy colon ones of patients with UC and colon biopsies of healthy patients.We enrolled, prior to informed consent, 11 patients (5 males and 6 females, age range 29-75 years, median age 52 years) with first UC diagnosis compared to 11 healthy controls (6 males and 5 females, age range 30-78 years, median age 55 years). We have therefore sampled inflammatory and healthy tissue in UC patients. We have also taken colic tissue samples in healthy subjects. Evaluation of receptor expression was performed by RT-PCR, Western Blot analysis. The ANOVA test (p <0.05) was used for statistical analysis.We found a) increased expression of UTR in 11/11 UC patients with ill mucosa biopsies compared to healthy controls in RT-PCR and in Western Blot analysis; ) increased UTR expression in 11/11 UC patients with ill colon biopsies compared to the results obtained from healthy colon biopsies of the same patients both in RT-PCR and in Western Blot analysis; c) increased UTR expression in 9/11 UC patients healthy colon biopsy specimens compared to healthy controls.UTR could be considered as an inflammatory UC disease marker because its expression is greater in the mucosa of ill colon than in the healthy colon of the same patients and compared to healthy controls.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31249629>Differential genetic and functional background in inflammatory bowel disease phenotypes of a Greek population: a systems bioinformatics approach.</a></h2><p>Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative  (UC) are the two main entities of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Previous works have identified more than 200 risk factors (including loci and signaling pathways) in populations of predominantly European ancestry. Our study was conducted on an extended population-specific cohort of 573 Greek IBD patients (364 CD and 209 UC) and 445 controls.To highlight the different genetic and functional background of IBD and its phenotypes, utilizing contemporary systems bioinformatics methodologies.Disease-associated SNPs, obtained via our own 89 loci IBD risk GWAS panel, were detected with the whole genome association analysis toolset PLINK. These SNPs were used as input for 2 novel and different pathway analysis methods to detect functional interactions. Specifically, PathwayConnector was used to create complementary networks of interacting pathways whereas; the online database of protein interactions STRING provided protein-protein association networks and their derived pathways. Network analyses metrics were employed to identify proteins with high significance and subsequently to rank the signaling pathways those participate in.The reported complementary pathway and enriched protein-protein association networks reveal several novel and well-known key players, in the functional background of IBD like Toll-like receptor, TNF, Jak-STAT, PI3K-Akt, T cell receptor, Apoptosis, MAPK and  cell receptor signaling pathways. IBD subphenotypes are found to have distinct genetic and functional profiles which can contribute to their accurate identification and classification. As a secondary result we identify an extended network of diseases with common molecular background to IBD.IBD's burden on the quality of life of patients and intricate functional background presents us constantly with new challenges. Our data and methodology provide researchers with new insights to a specific population, but also, to possible differentiation markers of disease classification and progression. This work, not only provides new insights into the interplay among IBD risk variants and their related signaling pathways, elucidates the mechanisms underlying IBD and its clinical sequelae, but also, introduces a generalized bioinformatics-based methodology which can be applied to studies of different disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31217423>Mass cytometry reveals systemic and local immune signatures that distinguish inflammatory bowel diseases.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative . Each disease is characterized by a diverse set of potential manifestations, which determine patients' disease phenotype. Current understanding of phenotype determinants is limited, despite increasing prevalence and healthcare costs. Diagnosis and monitoring of disease requires invasive procedures, such as endoscopy and tissue biopsy. Here we report signatures of heterogeneity between disease diagnoses and phenotypes. Using mass cytometry, we analyze leukocyte subsets, characterize their function(s), and examine gut-homing molecule expression in blood and intestinal tissue from healthy and/or IBD subjects. Some signatures persist in IBD despite remission, and many signatures are highly represented by leukocytes that express gut trafficking molecules. Moreover, distinct systemic and local immune signatures suggest patterns of cell localization in disease. Our findings highlight the importance of gut tropic leukocytes in circulation and reveal that blood-based immune signatures differentiate clinically relevant subsets of IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31131860>Expression Profiling of Inflammatory and Immunological Genes in Collagenous .</a></h2><p>Collagenous  [CC] is a common idiopathic cause of chronic watery diarrhoea. We investigated its pathogenesis by means of gene expression analysis.We analysed the expression of genes implicated in immunological and inflammatory pathways in paired colonic biopsies of histologically involved and uninvolved mucosa from five patients with histologically patchy CC, in pooled colonic biopsies of eight other patients with diffuse CC, and in pooled biopsies of eight normal controls. Analyses were performed with the Nanostring nCounter system. Expression ratios were generated and confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR.CC mucosa was characterized by enhanced expression of nitric oxide synthase 2; of matrix metalloproteinases 3 and 9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, but not transforming growth factor β1; of mediators of T-helper 1 immunity including interleukins 12A [IL12A], 12B, IL12 receptor B1 and interferon γ; of immune mediators of the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily ; and of multiple T cell cytokines and their receptors. The mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathway was unchanged. There were no increases in IL22, IL22RA2 or tumour necrosis factor α, which are reportedly elevated in chronic inflammatory bowel disease. In four of five patients with patchy CC, similar gene expression profiles were observed in histologically involved and uninvolved mucosa.CC is characterized by altered expression of a limited repertoire of genes involved in nitric oxide synthesis, extracellular matrix remodelling, T-helper 1 immunity and immune modulation. The abnormal gene expression in patchy CC may be expressed in mucosa with and without histological disease manifestations.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) appears to be promising in inducing UC remission, but there are no reports regarding administration using capsules.  Seven patients with active UC, aged 27-50 years, were treated with 25 multidonor FMT capsules daily for 50 days as a supplement to their standard treatment in an open-label pilot study. The primary objective was to follow symptoms through the Simple Clinical  Activity Index (SCCAI). Secondary objectives were to follow changes in fecal calprotectin and microbial diversity through fecal samples and quality of life through the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). Participants were followed through regular visits for six months.  From a median of 6 at baseline, the SCCAI of all participants decreased, with median decreases of 5 ( = .001) and 6 ( = .001) after 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. Three of the seven patients had flare-up/relapse of symptoms after the active treatment period. The median F-calprotectin of ≥1800 mg/kg at baseline decreased significantly during the treatment period, but increased again in the follow-up period. The median IBDQ improved at all visits compared to baseline. The fecal microbiota α-diversity did not increase in the study period compared to baseline. All participants completed the treatment and no serious adverse events were reported.

In such cases, the immune system fails to recognize between foreign agents and its own body cells. Different factors, such as genetic factors (CD25, STAT4), epigenetic factors (DNA methylation, histone modifications) and environmental factors (xenobiotics, drugs, hormones) trigger autoimmunity. Glucocorticoids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), immunosuppressive and biological agents are currently used to manage autoimmune diseases of different origins. However, complete cure remains elusive. Many dietary and natural products including polyphenols have been widely studied as possible alternative treatment strategies for the management of autoimmune disorders. Polyphenols possess a wide-range of pharmacological and therapeutic properties, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. As immunomodulatory agents, polyphenols are emerging pharmaceutical tools for management of various autoimmune disorders including vitiligo, ulcerative  and multiple sclerosis (MS). Polyphenols activate intracellular pathways such as arachidonic acid dependent pathway, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells (NF-κ) signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase  (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway and epigenetic modulation, which regulate the host's immune response. This timely review discusses putative points of action of polyphenols in autoimmune diseases, characterizing their efficacy and safety as therapeutic agents in managing autoimmune disorders.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of febuxostat against ulcerative , and to elucidate the potential mechanisms involved. Experimental  was induced in mice by intrarectal administration of 5% acetic acid. Mice were treated with febuxostat (10 and 20 mg/kg/day, orally) for three days. Results showed that body weight loss, colon shortening, macroscopic damage and histopathological changes of colonic mucosa were reduced in mice treated with febuxostat. Treatment of mice with febuxostat significantly increased the levels of glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), carbonyl protein, xanthine oxidase, nitric oxide (NO) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity of colon tissue compared with those in the acetic acid-induced  group. The expression of nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) as a key regulator of inflammation in the colonic tissue was decreased by febuxostat. Furthermore treatment with febuxostat significantly reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and interferon (IFN)-γ, while increased the levels of IL-10 compared with the  group. These results suggest that febuxostat is able to decrease the severity of acetic acid-induced  by inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses through NF-κ pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Washer/Disinfectors (WDs) are commonly used to clean and decontaminate soiled equipment in health care facilities. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the DEKO-190 WD in removing C. difficile spores from bedpans.Plastic carriers were inoculated with suspensions of C. difficile spores in autoclaved (sterile) human faeces. The carriers were then taped to a sterile plastic bedpan which was subjected to short, long or intensive wash cycles in the WD using one of two test detergents: Formula A (generic) and Formula  (highly alkaline). Mean log reductions in spores were calculated for each wash cycle.Mean log reductions were 3.21(SEM ± 0.20) and 2.82 (±0.13) for Formula A and , respectively, for the short cycle. The mean log reductions using the long wash cycle were 3.65 (±0.44) using Formula A and 5.30 (±0.43) using Formula , while log reductions were 3.37 (±0.58) (Formula A) and 4.64 (±0.47) (Formula ) for the intensive cycle. Washing with the DEKO-190 significantly reduced spore concentrations on carrier surfaces on a bedpan.

While clinical differences among them are well known, the underlying mechanisms are less explored. To gain an insight into the IBD pathogenesis and to find a specific biomarker pattern for each of them, we used protein array, ELISA and flow cytometry to analyze serum biomarkers and specific anti-microbial  and T cell responses to the gut commensals. We found that decrease in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and increase in MMP-14 are the strongest factors discriminating IBD patients from healthy subjects and that PSC-IBD patients have higher levels of Mannan-binding lectin, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1), CD14 and osteoprotegerin than patients with UC. Moreover, we found that low transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is associated with disease relapse and low osteoprotegerin with anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) therapy.

The level of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-8 in plasma was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Inter-cellular tight junctions were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The feces and intestinal contents were collected sterilely, and intestinal flora was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing.Compared with group , Sb reduced the disease activity index and histological score of group C (disease activity index: group  2.708 ± 0.628, group C 1.542 ± 0.616, PBC = 0.005; histological score: group  9.875 ± 3.271, group C 4.750 ± 1.832, PBC = 0.005) in DSS-induced  in mice. Sb exerted a protect effect on the expression of ZO-1 (group  2.075 ± 1.176, group C 4.225 ± 1.316, PBC = 0.019) and occludin (group  2.200 ± 0.968, group C 3.525 ± 1.047, PBC = 0.023). Compared with group , Sb decreased the level of TNF-α and IL-8 of group C (TNF-α: group  716.323 ± 44.691 ng/L, group C 521.740 ± 90.121 ng/L, PBC = 0.001; IL-8: group  128.992 ± 11.475 pg/mL, group C 106.283 ± 15.906 pg/mL, PBC = 0.012). Treatment with Sb preserved the tight junctions and ameliorated microvilli and inter-cellular space. Treatment with Sb also showed its own characteristics: a higher percentage of Bacteroidetes and a lower percentage of Firmicutes, with significant differences or a significant trend. The proportion of the S24-7 family was increased significantly in the Sb treatment group.Sb shows an anti-inflammatory effect and has a protective effect on the intestinal mucosal mechanical barrier. Sb may up-regulate the abundance of family S24-7 specifically, and maybe a mechanism underlying its function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061891>Humoral response to  in inflammatory bowel disease, including correlation with immunomodulatory treatment.</a></h2><p>An abnormal immune response to intestinal bacteria has been observed in Crohn's disease (CD).  infection incidence and severity are increased in CD, but reports on the humoral response have provided conflicting results. We aimed to shed light on the possible role of C. difficile in CD pathogenesis by paying attention to the influence of immunomodulatory treatment on the humoral response.A total of 71 consecutive outpatients with CD, 67 with ulcerative  (UC), and 121 healthy controls were analyzed for serum IgA and IgG to C. difficile toxins A and .IgA levels were similar in all study groups. IgG to toxin A was increased similarly in CD and UC ( = 0.02 for both). In contrast, IgG to toxin  was elevated only in CD patients not receiving disease-modifying anti-inflammatory bowel disease drugs (DMAID) ( = 16) ( = 0.0001), while the CD medication subgroup ( = 47) had a level similar to healthy controls. The UC results were not influenced by DMAID treatment.Our findings add support to the idea of a disturbed interaction between intestinal cells and the microbiota being part of the CD disease mechanism. An abnormal immune response to C. difficile toxin  may be a critical component of this interaction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135224>Dietary  Fruit Attenuates -Associated Tumorigenesis: A Pivotal Role of the NF-κ/IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 Pathway.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including ulcerative  (UC) is one of the risk factors for the development of -associated colon cancer (CAC). CAC is a type of colorectal cancer (CRC), the third leading cause of cancer death.  (ZJ) fruit contains bioactive components such as polysaccharides, triterpenoid acid, and flavonoids, and it has shown anti-inflammatory property. The aim of the study was to investigate the protective effect of dietary ZJ on -associated colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. Mice ( = 42, two sets) were injected with azoxymethane (AOM) followed by three cycles of 2% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water to induce CAC. Simultaneously, those mice were fed with ZJ diet for 70 days (5% or 10% w/w). Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by LSD Bonferroni test. Dietary ZJ decreased fecal blood, diarrhea, disease activity index (DAI), spleen weight ( < 0.001), and the number of tumors ( < 0.001). In addition, dietary ZJ increased colon length ( < 0.001) and suppressed the activation of NF-к/IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway. In conclusion, we suggest that dietary ZJ attenuates inflammation by interfering NF-κ/IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway, thereby inhibits AOM/DSS-induced colon tumorigenesis in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063937>Regulation of CD11b by HIF-1α and the STAT3 signaling pathway contributes to the immunosuppressive function of  cells in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p> cells have been reported to have a suppressive function in autoimmune diseases, which appears to require an increase of CD11b expression on  cells. However, little is known how CD11b is induced in  cells to play the function. In this study, we found that the high expression of CD11b in  cells occurred not only in the mucosal immune organs, but also in systemically immune organs such as the spleen during dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced . Since the inflammatory lesions in mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were revealed to be significantly hypoxic or even anoxic, the  cells from colitic mice Peyer's patches (PP) were investigated to express higher levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) than naïve  cells from wildtype (WT) mice. HIF-1α siRNA transfection or HIF-1α protein inhibition led to decreased CD11b expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in vitro.  cells with HIF-1α specific knockdown were then adoptively transferred to Rag-1 mice. The result displayed that CD11b expression was decreased in  cells and an exacerbated  occurred. The bio-informatics promoter analysis and ChIP assay showed that HIF-1α was the critical transcription factor for CD11b and cooperatively formed a complex with the p-STAT3 homodimers to bind onto hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) regions, which was guaranteed by MEK/ERK pathway activation and IL-10 secretion. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the key function of the hypoxia-associated transcription factor HIF-1α together with p-STAT3 in driving CD11b transcription in  cells and controlling  cell's protective activity in experimental inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we describe the efficiency of primary antibody-conjugated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to specifically target chronic inflammatory processes, specially M2 macrophages, in tissue sections of ulcerative  (UC) and steatohepatitis in rats which may lead to colorectal cancer and liver carcinoma, respectively. In this study, we demonstrate that AuNPs synthesized by a simple, inexpensive, and environmentally compatible method can be easily conjugated with the antibodies anti-COX-2, anti-MIF, and Alexa Fluor® 488 (ALEXA) to perform immunofluorescence staining in inflamed tissues. Moreover, we showed that primary antibody-conjugated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can be used to target M2 macrophages by flow cytometry. We designed three immunofluorescence staining protocols of tissue section with AuNPs for 30 min and overnight incubation, as well as one flow cytometry protocol of M2 macrophage labeling with AuNPs for 30 min. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry results suggest that conjugation was achieved by direct adsorption of antibodies on the AuNPs surface. When compared to the standard ALEXA protocol in immunofluorescence (IF) and flow cytometry (FC), our 30-min incubation protocol using AuNPs instead of ALEXA decreased from approximately 23 h to 5 h for IF and from 4 h to 1 h for FC, proving to be less laborious, which makes the method eligible for inflammation-induced cancer diagnostic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599462>Symptoms among emerging adults with inflammatory bowel disease: a descriptive study.</a></h2><p>Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are commonly diagnosed when they are between the ages of 18-29, a developmental period known as emerging adulthood. Typically, emerging adults are subsumed into the category of adults even though emerging adults have unique developmental needs. In this descriptive study of IBD in emerging adults, the aims were to (a) determine the prevalence of symptoms; () describe the severity of symptoms and their interference with daily activities; and (c) examine the association between individual symptom severity and presence of fatigue. Emerging adults with IBD were recruited using web-based convenience sampling. Sixty-one individuals met the inclusion criteria. They had a mean age of 24.7 and a disease duration of 6.4 years. The most prevalent symptoms reported were: fatigue (n = 44, 72.1%), abdominal cramps (n = 39, 63.9%), abdominal pain (n = 39, 63.9%), and diarrhea (n = 38, 62.3%). The symptom with the greatest severity and interference with daily activities was fatigue. Abdominal cramps, abdominal pain, diarrhea, passing gas, and abdominal tenderness were associated with fatigue when controlling for age, emerging adulthood, gender, time since diagnosis, and current steroid use. Among emerging adults with IBD, fatigue is the most prevalent symptom and is the symptom with the greatest severity and interference with daily activities. These results suggest a need for interventions aimed at reducing both fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms among emerging adults with IBD.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31179826>Dietary iron variably modulates assembly of the intestinal microbiota in -resistant and -susceptible mice.</a></h2><p>Iron deficiency, a common comorbidity of gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), is often treated with oral iron supplementation. However, the safety of oral iron supplementation remains controversial because of its association with exacerbated disease activity in a subset of IBD patients. Because iron modulates bacterial growth and function, one possible mechanism by which iron may exacerbate inflammation in susceptible hosts is by modulating the intestinal microbiota. We, therefore, investigated the impact of dietary iron on the intestinal microbiota, utilizing the conventionalization of germ-free mice as a model of a microbial community in compositional flux to recapitulate the instability of the IBD-associated intestinal microbiota. Our findings demonstrate that altering intestinal iron availability during community assembly modulated the microbiota in non-inflamed wild type (WT) and -susceptible interleukin-10-deficient () mice. Depletion of luminal iron availability promoted luminal compositional changes associated with dysbiotic states irrespective of host genotype, including an expansion of Enterobacteriaceae such as . Mechanistic  growth competitions confirmed that high-affinity iron acquisition systems in  enhance its abundance over other bacteria in iron-restricted conditions, thereby enabling pathobiont iron scavenging during dietary iron restriction. In contrast, distinct luminal community assembly was observed with dietary iron supplementation in WT versus  mice, suggesting that the effects of increased iron on the microbiota differ with host inflammation status. Taken together, shifts in dietary iron intake during community assembly modulate the ecological structure of the intestinal microbiota and is dependent on host genotype and inflammation status.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31136648>Phenotypic variation in paediatric IBD by age: a multi-centre prospective inception cohort study of the Canadian Children IBD Network.</a></h2><p>Aims: Incidence of paediatric IBD in Canada is among the highest worldwide and age of onset may be decreasing. In a multi-centre nation-wide inception cohort study, we examined variation in phenotype of IBD throughout the paediatric age spectrum.Children ≥2y and <17y (A1 age at diagnosis) with new onset IBD were systematically evaluated at sites of the Canadian Children IBD Network. Prospectively recorded phenotypic data were compared between age groups.Among 1092 children (70% Caucasian; 64% CD, 36% UC/IBD-U; median age 13y (IQR 11-15y)), 210 (19%) were diagnosed prior to age 10y (Paris A1a) and 43 (4%) prior to age 6y (VEO-IBD). CD was less common in younger children (42%, 56%, 66%, respectively, of VEO-IBD, A1a; A1b). Colon-only IBD (UC/IBDU or CD-colon) was present in 81% of VEO-IBD and 65% of A1a; ileal disease increased progressively, reaching plateau at age 10y. CD location was ileocolonic (L3) in 53% overall. Ileitis (L1) increased with age (6% of VEO-IBD; 13% of A1a; 21% of A1b), as did stricturing/penetrating CD (4% of A1a; 11% of A1b). At all ages UC was extensive (E3/E4) in >85% and disease activity moderate to severe according to PGA and wPCDAI/PUCAI in >70%. Heights were modestly reduced in CD (mean height z score -0.30±1.23), but normal in UC/IBD-U.Paris classification of age at diagnosis is supported by age-related increases in ileal disease until age 10 years. Other phenotypic features including severity are similar across all ages. Linear growth is less impaired in CD than in historical cohorts, reflecting earlier diagnosis.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO). Published by Oxford University Press.

The most notable drawbacks of CART are cytokine release syndrome and CART-related encephalopathy syndrome. Gastrointestinal adverse events (GI-AEs) have not yet been reported in association with CART. Herein, we describe the incidence and clinical features of GI-AEs observed after CART.We report a case series of patients with hematologic malignancies who received CART, in a clinical trial or as the standard of care, and subsequently suffered from GI-AEs between 2012 and 2018.In our cohort, 37 of 132 (28%) patients experienced GI-AEs. All 37 experienced diarrhea with a median onset of 7 days (interquartile range, 4 to 25 d) after CART infusion. The median age of these patients was 58 years. Most had diffuse large -cell lymphoma (51%). Seventeen patients experienced cytokine release syndrome, and 9 experienced CART-related encephalopathy syndrome. The interleukin-6 antagonist was required in 15 patients. Overall, 49% of patients had grade 1 diarrhea, 32% had grade 2, and 15% had grade 3. Other gastrointestinal symptoms in these patients were abdominal pain (41%), nausea and vomiting (49%), fever (8%), bloody stools (3%), and abdominal distension (5%). The median duration of symptoms was 6 days (interquartile range, 3 to 9 d). In 32 patients who underwent imaging, 8 (25%) had findings suggestive of gastrointestinal tract inflammation. Nine (24%) patients experienced GI-AE recurrence after initial improvement. The symptoms were attributed to an alternative cause in 17 (13%) cases and to CART in 20 (15%) cases. One patient developed CART-related refractory  that eventually responded to antibiotics for pneumonia.CART-related GI-AEs occur in 15% of patients treated with CART. These symptoms are typically mild and self-limiting, requiring only symptomatic treatment. Nevertheless, CART may, in rare cases, lead to refractory .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659017>Dendritic Cells Control Regulatory T Cell Function Required for Maintenance of Intestinal Tissue Homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Dendritic cells (DCs) together with regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential mediators of immune homeostasis. Disruption of function or frequency of either cell type can lead to fatal autoimmunity. We previously described that mice constitutively lacking DCs (∆DC) develop autoimmunity characterized by reduced body weight, autoantibodies, and pronounced intestinal inflammation. In this study, we show that lack of DCs leads to an altered gene expression profile in peripheral but not thymic Tregs with increased expression of inhibitory receptors. The suppressive function of Tregs from ΔDC mice was impaired in T cell cocultures. In a model of transfer , Tregs from ∆DC mice were only functional in the presence of DCs in recipient mice. Lack of MHC class II on DCs also resulted in upregulation of inhibitory receptors on Tregs, reduced body weight, and elevated serum IgA levels. Further analysis of the IgA response revealed an expansion of IgA germinal center  cells and plasma cells in mesenteric lymph nodes and more IgA-coated commensal bacteria in feces of ∆DC mice. Thus, we show a critical role for DCs to establish intestinal homeostasis by regulating Treg function for prevention of spontaneous inflammation.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30991003>Double Drug Delivery Using Capped Mesoporous Silica Microparticles for the Effective Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Silica mesoporous microparticles loaded with both rhodamine  fluorophore (S1) or hydrocortisone (S2), and capped with an olsalazine derivative, are prepared and fully characterized. Suspensions of S1 and S2 in water at an acidic and a neutral pH show negligible dye/drug release, yet a notable delivery took place when the reducing agent sodium dithionite is added because of hydrolysis of an azo bond in the capping ensemble. Additionally, olsalazine fragmentation induced 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) release. In vitro digestion models show that S1 and S2 solids are suitable systems to specifically release a pharmaceutical agent in the colon. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in rats show a preferential rhodamine  release from S1 in the colon. Moreover, a model of ulcerative  is induced in rats by oral administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) solutions, which was also used to prove the efficacy of S2 for  treatment. The specific delivery of hydrocortisone and 5-ASA from S2 material to the colon tissue in injured rats markedly lowers the colon/body weight ratio and the clinical activity score.

However, the phenotypes and functions of human MSCs (hMSCs)-treated Breg cell subsets are not yet clear.  Purified  cells were cocultured with MSCs and the phenotypes and immunomodulatory functions of the  cells were analyzed by FACS and proliferation assays . Also, a trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced mouse  model was employed to detect the function of MSC-treated Breg cells .  We demonstrated that coculturing with hMSCs significantly enhanced the immunomodulatory activity of  cells by up-regulating IL-10 expression. We then identified that a novel regulatory  cell population characterized by CD23 and CD43 phenotypic markers could be induced by hMSCs. The CD23CD43 Breg cells substantially inhibited the inflammatory cytokine secretion and proliferation of T cells through an IL-10-dependent pathway. More significantly, intraperitoneal injection of hMSCs ameliorated the clinical and histopathological severity in the mouse experimental  model, accompanied by an increase in the number of CD23CD43 Breg cells. The adoptive transfer of CD23CD43  cells effectively alleviated murine , as compared with the CD23CD43  cells. Treatment with CD23CD43  cells, and not hMSCs, substantially improved the symptoms of  in  cell-depleted mice.  the novel CD23CD43 Breg cell subset appears to be involved in the immunomodulatory function of hMSCs and sheds new light on elucidating the therapeutic mechanism of hMSCs for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31039157>I_MDS: an inflammatory bowel disease molecular activity score to classify patients with differing disease-driving pathways and therapeutic response to anti-TNF treatment.</a></h2><p>Crohn's disease and ulcerative  are driven by both common and distinct underlying mechanisms of pathobiology. Both diseases, exhibit heterogeneity underscored by the variable clinical responses to therapeutic interventions. We aimed to identify disease-driving pathways and classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in their pathobiology and response to treatment. We applied hierarchical clustering of enrichment scores derived from gene set variation analysis of signatures representative of various immunological processes and activated cell types, to a colonic biopsy dataset that included healthy volunteers, Crohn's disease and ulcerative  patients. Patient stratification at baseline or after anti-TNF treatment in clinical responders and non-responders was queried. Signatures with significantly different enrichment scores were identified using a general linear model. Comparisons to healthy controls were made at baseline in all participants and then separately in responders and non-responders. Fifty-nine percent of the signatures were commonly enriched in both conditions at baseline, supporting the notion of a disease continuum within ulcerative  and Crohn's disease. Signatures included T cells, macrophages, neutrophil activation and poly:IC signatures, representing acute inflammation and a complex mix of potential disease-driving biology. Collectively, identification of significantly enriched signatures allowed establishment of an inflammatory bowel disease molecular activity score which uses biopsy transcriptomics as a surrogate marker to accurately track disease severity. This score separated diseased from healthy samples, enabled discrimination of clinical responders and non-responders at baseline with 100% specificity and 78.8% sensitivity, and was validated in an independent data set that showed comparable classification. Comparing responders and non-responders separately at baseline to controls, 43% and 70% of signatures were enriched, respectively, suggesting greater molecular dysregulation in TNF non-responders at baseline. This methodological approach could facilitate better targeted design of clinical studies to test therapeutics, concentrating on patient subsets sharing similar underlying pathobiology, therefore increasing the likelihood of clinical response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570011>Trace amine associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) expression and modulation of inflammatory cytokine production in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages: a novel mechanism for inflammation in ulcerative .</a></h2><p> Tissue resident macrophages and peripherally infiltrating macrophages play a prominent role in maintaining homeostasis in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), though aberrant activation is implicated in inflammatory conditions, including ulcerative  (UC). Recent metabolomic studies indicate that tyramine (TYR) is elevated in the stool of patients with UC. TYR activates the mammalian trace amine associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). Our previous work identified TAAR1 expression in mixed populations of immune cells, whereas a limited number of other studies have identified TAAR1-dependent effects in cytokine secretion and gene expression in T-cells and -cells.  To investigate whether TAAR1 may serve as a novel target for an anti-inflammatory therapeutic in UC, we explored TAAR1 expression in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), and its upregulation and activation in response to LPS and TYR.  Here, we demonstrate for the first time that TAAR1 is expressed in BMDM and undergoes agonist-induced upregulation. Additionally, TYR elicits significant increases in inflammatory cytokine gene expression in non-polarized and LPS-polarized BMDM, and the TAAR1 antagonist EPPTB inhibits the TYR-mediated upregulation of TAAR1 and inflammatory cytokine gene expression in BMDM.  Our data suggest that TAAR1 is a mediator of macrophage inflammation and a potential therapeutic target to attenuate UC symptomology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31094175>Risk factors associated with portal vein thrombosis in liver cirrhosis: A case-control study.</a></h2><p>To build a predictive model for PVT in cirrhotic patients.A single centre case-control study was carried out.

Thymic changes were morphometrically assessed; the number and absolute area of thymic corpuscles and epithelial cells were calculated; and the subpopulation composition of lymphocytes and thymic stromal cells was determined using flow cytofluorimetry; the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney test were used to compare the groups.In acute catarrhal and ulcerative , there was acute accidental thymic involution with devastation of the cortical substance and with a decline in its volume fraction, with an increase in the levels of cells dying through the mechanism of apoptosis, and with a decrease in the absolute number of lymphocytes, T-helper cells, cytotoxic T-cells, regulatory T-lymphocytes, -lymphocytes, and dendritic cells, with a rise in the index of the area of thymic corpuscles and in the content of late-phase corpuscles among them, and with the appearance of thymic corpuscles as cyst-like cavities. In chronic ulcerative , the cortex was expanded and the area of thymic corpuscles and the count of medullary epithelial cells increased. The cyst-like thymic corpuscles formed clusters, the count of dendritic cells increased in early-stage chronic ulcerative , but the levels of macrophages decreased in both periods of its development.There is acute accidental involution and thymic hyperplasia with an increase in medullary epithelial cells and thymic corpuscles consisting of cytokeratin 19 in the epithelial cells in experimental acute and chronic ulcerative , respectively. The more pronounced epithelial cell response found in end-stage experimental chronic ulcerative  reflects the enhanced differentiation of regulatory T-lymphocytes and the larger number of which is observed in peripheral blood and in the focus of inflammation in patients with ulcerative , according to the literature.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31057300>Unconjugated bilirubin alleviates experimental ulcerative  by regulating intestinal barrier function and immune inflammation.</a></h2><p>Unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) is generally considered toxic but has gained recent prominence for its anti-inflammatory properties.

IL-33 can be produced by various tissues and cells, and typically induces Th2-type immune responses via binding to the receptor ST2. In addition, accumulated data have shown that IL-33 also plays a modulatory role in the function of regulatory T cells (Tregs),  cells, and innate immune cells such as macrophages and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). IBD, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative , are characterized by aberrant immunological responses leading to intestinal tissue injury and destruction. Although IL-33 expression is increased in IBD patients and correlates with the patients' disease activity index, mechanistic studies to date have demonstrated both pathogenic and protective roles in animal models of experimental . In this review, we will summarize the roles and mechanisms of IL-33 in IBD, which is essential to understand the pathogenesis of IBD and determine potential therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660640>Efficacy and safety of tofacitinib dose de-escalation and dose escalation for patients with ulcerative : results from OCTAVE Open.</a></h2><p>For patients with UC, flexible maintenance dosing therapy may confer advantages for safety, efficacy, costs and patient preference. Tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule JAK inhibitor for the treatment of UC.To assess the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib dose de-escalation and escalation in patients with UC.We evaluated data (November 2017 data cut-off) from OCTAVE Open, an ongoing, open-label, long-term extension study. The dose de-escalation group comprised 66 tofacitinib induction responders in remission following 52 weeks' tofacitinib 10 mg .d. maintenance therapy, subsequently de-escalated to 5 mg .d. in OCTAVE Open. The dose escalation group comprised 57 tofacitinib induction responders who experienced treatment failure while receiving 5 mg .d. maintenance therapy, subsequently escalated to 10 mg .d. in OCTAVE Open.After tofacitinib de-escalation, 92.4% (61/66) and 84.1% (53/63) of patients maintained clinical response and 80.3% (53/66) and 74.6% (47/63) maintained remission, at months 2 and 12, respectively.

However, the underlying mechanism requires further investigation. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) has immune regulatory functions, but its role in immune regulatory activities in the intestinal mucosa is not fully understood. This study aims to elucidate the role of VIP in the regulation of regulatory  cell (Breg) function in the intestine. : Peripheral blood samples were collected from UC patients and healthy control (HC) subjects. Bregs were isolated from these samples and their immune regulatory function was analyzed. A murine  model was established to test the role of VIP in inhibiting inflammation in the intestine. : Serum IL-10 and VIP levels were lower in IgE (≥0.35 IU/mL) UC patients than that in HC subjects. The immune suppressive function of Bregs isolated from IgE UC patients was impaired. IL-10 mRNA decayed spontaneously in Bregs, which was reversed by VIP added to the culture. Tristetraprolin (TTP) bound IL-10 mRNA to speed its decay, which was blocked by VIP in the culture. Administration of VIP efficiently inhibited experimental . : Insufficient VIP levels in the microenvironment speeds IL-10 mRNA decay to cause Breg dysfunction.

Importantly, TNF neutralization is also used for the treatment of corticosteroid-refractory immune-related adverse events (irAEs) induced by the combined anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy. The manifestation of these toxicities is an important limiting factor for the successful implementation of the inhibitory checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB), restraining its anti-tumor efficacy. In our recent study (Perez-Ruiz , Nature 569(7756): 428-432.), we analyzed the potential impact of prophylactic TNF neutralization therapy in the anti-PD1/CTLA-4 efficacy. Through several mouse models, we demonstrated that TNF neutralization ameliorated ICB-exacerbated  in addition to improving ICB-dependent anti-tumor efficacy. Similar results were obtained after prophylactic TNF blockade in graft vs host xenografted mouse models with human immune cells, which showed a reduction in  and hepatitis. Importantly, there was a preservation of the immunotherapeutic control of xenografted tumors after ICB treatment. Moreover, TNF and TNF-dependent gene expression is upregulated in the colon mucosa from patients affected by  as a side effect of ipilimumab and nivolumab. Our results, thus, provide evidence of the successful combination of prophylactic TNF neutralization with ICB therapy strategy to ameliorate toxicities, while keeping or even ameliorating anti-tumor efficacy. The prophylactic TNF blockade strategy is clinically feasible since excellent TNF inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of autoimmunity and are used for the immune-related serious adverse events in immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31211700>Microbiota maintain colonic homeostasis by activating TLR2/MyD88/PI3K signaling in IL-10-producing regulatory  cells.</a></h2><p>Resident microbiota activate regulatory cells that modulate intestinal inflammation and promote and maintain intestinal homeostasis. IL-10 is a key mediator of immune regulatory function. Our studies described the functional importance and mechanisms by which gut microbiota and specific microbial components influenced the development of intestinal IL-10-producing  cells. We used fecal transplant to germ-free (GF) Il10+/EGFP reporter and Il10-/- mice to demonstrate that microbiota from specific pathogen-free mice primarily stimulated IL-10-producing colon-specific  cells and T regulatory-1 cells in ex-GF mice. IL-10 in turn down-regulated microbiota-activated mucosal inflammatory cytokines. TLR2/9 ligands and enteric bacterial lysates preferentially induced IL-10 production and regulatory capacity of intestinal  cells. Analysis of Il10+/EGFP mice crossed with additional gene-deficient strains and  cell co-transfer studies demonstrated that microbiota-induced IL-10-producing intestinal  cells ameliorated chronic T cell-mediated  in a TLR2, MyD88 and PI3K-dependent fashion. In vitro studies implicated PI3Kp110δ and AKT downstream signaling. These studies demonstrated that resident enteric bacteria activated intestinal IL-10-producing  cells through TLR2, MyD88 and PI3K pathways. These  cells reduced colonic T cell activation and maintained mucosal homeostasis in response to intestinal microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635441> S1 Improves  induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid by the Inhibition of NF-κ Signaling in Mice.</a></h2><p> S1 strongly inhibits the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in lipopolysaccharide-induced peritoneal macrophages for the mechanism that lactic acid bacteria from kimchi inhibit tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was isolated. The protective effect of this strain on the  mouse model induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) was further evaluated.

Blockade of PI3K signaling with idelalisib is effective for the treatment of relapsed CLL in combination with the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab. In this single-arm, open-label, nonrandomized phase 2 study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of idelalisib with ofatumumab in 27 patients with treatment-naïve CLL in need of therapy. Patients were planned to receive idelalisib for 2 monthly cycles, then idelalisib and ofatumumab for 6 cycles, followed by idelalisib indefinitely. The study was closed early and all patients ceased therapy when an increased rate of death as a result of infection was observed on other first-line idelalisib trials. Median time on therapy was 8.1 months, and median duration of follow-up was 39.7 months. We previously reported high rates of hepatotoxicity in a smaller cohort of patients in this trial; toxicities necessitated therapy discontinuation in 15 patients after a median of 7.7 months. The most frequent grade ≥3 adverse events were transaminitis (52% of patients), neutropenia (33%), and /diarrhea (15%). The best overall response rate (ORR) was 88.9%, including 1 complete response. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 23 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 18-36 months); 11 patients have not yet required second-line therapy. Idelalisib and ofatumumab demonstrated an unacceptable safety profile in the first-line setting, which resulted in a short PFS despite a high ORR. Future development of PI3K inhibitors for use in treatment-naïve CLL will require novel approaches to mitigate toxicities.

Vitamin D receptor (VDR) deficiency in the intestine leads to abnormal Paneth cells and impaired autophagy function. Here, we will elucidate the mechanisms of the intestinal epithelial VDR regulation of autophagy and apoptosis. We used  VDR and VDR mice and  organoids generated from small intestine and colon tissues. We found that VDR deficiency induced more apoptotic cells and significantly increased cell death in the small intestine and colon of VDR mice. The proapoptotic protein -cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) associated X protein (Bax) was enhanced, whereas autophagy related 16 like 1 (ATG16L1) and Beclin-1 were decreased in the intestines of VDR mice. Apoptosis induced by Bax reduced autophagy by decreasing Beclin-1. Physical interactions between Beclin-1 and Bcl-2 were increased in the VDR-deficient epithelia from mice. The growth of VDR organoids was significantly slower with fewer Paneth cells than that of VDR organoids. The expression levels of Beclin-1 and lysozyme were decreased in VDR organoids. Bacterial endotoxin levels were high in the serum from VDR mice and made mice susceptible to . In the organoids and  IL-10 mice, vitamin D treatment increased VDR and ATG16L1 protein expression levels, which activated autophagic responses. In summary, intestinal epithelial VDR regulates autophagy and apoptosis through ATG16L1 and Beclin-1.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of locally administered adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells in a model of high-risk colonic anastomosis in rats.Seven days after induction of  with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, Wistar rats were submitted to a transection of the descending colon followed by end-to-end anastomosis and were then treated with 2×10 adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (from the preperitoneal fat) or an acellular culture solution instilled onto the surface of the anastomosis. At day 14, after macroscopic survey of the abdominal cavity, the anastomotic area was submitted to histologic and immunohistochemical analysis, evaluation of myeloperoxidase activity, fibrosis, epithelial integrity, NF-κ  activation, expression of inflammatory cytokines, and extracellular matrix-related genes.Anastomotic leakage and mortality associated with high-risk anastomosis decreased with treatment with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (P < .03). Application of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells resulted in lower histologic scores (P = .011), decreased deposition of collagen fibers (P = .003), preservation of goblet cells (P = .033), decreased myeloperoxidase activity (P = .012), decreased accumulation of CD4+ T-cells (P = .014) and macrophages (P = .011) in the lamina propria, a decrease in the number of apoptotic cells (P = .008), and the activation of NF-κ  (P = .036). Overexpression of IL-17, TNF-α , IFN-γ, and metalloproteinases in the acellular culture solution-treated, high-risk anastomosis group decreased (P < .05) to near normal values with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells treatment.Improvements in outcomes of a high-risk colonic anastomosis with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells therapy reflect the immunomodulatory activity and healing effect of these cells, even after just topical administration and reinforces their use in future translational research.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A total of 56 Wistar rats were randomly divided into 6 groups: normal control group(double distilled water), model group(double distilled water), mesalazine group(10 mL·kg~(-1)), high dose, middle dose and low dose Shaoyao Tang groups(2.4, 1.2, and 0.6 g·mL~(-1)). After UC rat models were established by 2, 4-dinitrochlorobenzene(DNCB)/ethanol enema, the rats received double distilled water or corresponding drugs twice a day for 7 days. After the treatment cycle, the general performance and disease activity index(DAI) of rats were observed on the next day. Then the rats were sacrificed. The length of colon was measured. Macroscopic and histological score of colon were evaluated. Histopathological changes of colon were observed by HE staining. Ultraviolet spectrophotometry detection was used to detect the content of myeloperoxidase(MPO) in blood and colon tissues. The levels of P-selectin, macrophage migration inhibitory factor(MIF) and thromboxane _2(TXB_2) in blood and colon tissues were determined by ELISA. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were performed to detect the protein expressions of TLR4 and NF-κ in colon tissues. The results showed that as compared with the model group, Shaoyao Tang of different doses improved the general performance of UC rats. Moreover, high-dose Shaoyao Tang group showed the most obvious effect in scoring of disease activity index(P<0.001); both medium and high doses of Shaoyao Tang significantly inhibited the colon shortening and pathological injury, with significantly decreased expression levels of MPO, P-selectin, MIF and TXB_(2 )in serum and colon tissues of UC rats(P<0.001). Immunohistochemistry and Western blot assay showed that the levels of TLR4 and NF-κ protein expression in the colon tissues of Shaoyao Tang high-dose group were remarkably lower than that in the model group(P<0.001).

In addition, we further discuss the direct and indirect evidence linking mitophagy to inflammation and autoimmunity underlying the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).

Neoadjuvant treatment with ipilimumab plus nivolumab at the standard dosing schedule induced pathological responses in a high proportion of patients in two small independent early-phase trials, and no patients with a pathological response have relapsed after a median follow up of 32 months. However, toxicity of the standard ipilimumab plus nivolumab dosing schedule was high, preventing its broader clinical use. The aim of the OpACIN-neo trial was to identify a dosing schedule of ipilimumab plus nivolumab that is less toxic but equally effective.OpACIN-neo is a multicentre, open-label, phase 2, randomised, controlled trial. Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years, had a WHO performance status of 0-1, had resectable stage III melanoma involving lymph nodes only, and measurable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. Patients were enrolled from three medical centres in Australia, Sweden, and the Netherlands, and were randomly assigned (1:1:1), stratified by site, to one of three neoadjuvant dosing schedules: group A, two cycles of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg plus nivolumab 1 mg/kg once every 3 weeks intravenously; group , two cycles of ipilimumab 1 mg/kg plus nivolumab 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks intravenously; or group C, two cycles of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks directly followed by two cycles of nivolumab 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks intravenously. The investigators, site staff, and patients were aware of the treatment assignment during the study participation. Pathologists were masked to treatment allocation and all other data. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with grade 3-4 immune-related toxicity within the first 12 weeks and the proportion of patients achieving a radiological objective response and pathological response at 6 weeks. Analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number , and is ongoing with an additional extension cohort and to complete survival analysis.Between Nov 24, 2016 and June 28, 2018, 105 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 89 (85%) eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the three groups. Three patients were excluded after randomisation because they were found to be ineligible, and 86 received at least one dose of study drug; 30 patients in group A, 30 in group , and 26 in group C (accrual to this group was closed early upon advice of the Data Safety Monitoring Board on June 4, 2018 because of severe adverse events). Within the first 12 weeks, grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events were observed in 12 (40%) of 30 patients in group A, six (20%) of 30 in group , and 13 (50%) of 26 in group C. The difference in grade 3-4 toxicity between group  and A was -20% (95% CI -46 to 6; p=0·158) and between group C and group A was 10% (-20 to 40; p=0·591). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were elevated liver enzymes in group A (six [20%)]) and  in group C (five [19%]); in group , none of the grade 3-4 adverse events were seen in more than one patient. One patient (in group A) died 9·5 months after the start of treatment due to the consequences of late-onset immune-related encephalitis, which was possibly treatment-related. 19 (63% [95% CI 44-80]) of 30 patients in group A, 17 (57% [37-75]) of 30 in group , and nine (35% [17-56]) of 26 in group C achieved a radiological objective response, while pathological responses occurred in 24 (80% [61-92]) patients in group A, 23 (77% [58-90]) in group , and 17 (65% [44-83]) in group C.OpACIN-neo identified a tolerable neoadjuvant dosing schedule (group : two cycles of ipilimumab 1 mg/kg plus nivolumab 3 mg/kg) that induces a pathological response in a high proportion of patients and might be suitable for broader clinical use. When more mature data confirm these early observations, this schedule should be tested in randomised phase 3 studies versus adjuvant therapies, which are the current standard-of-care systemic therapy for patients with stage III melanoma.Bristol-Myers Squibb.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was designed to determine effects and mechanisms of SNS on colonic inflammation of in rodent models of IBD and compare the difference among SNS, VNS, and SNS plus VNS.Intestinal inflammation in rats was induced by intrarectal administration of TNBS (2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid) on the first day. Five days after intrarectal TNBS, the rats were treated with sham-VNS, VNS, Sham-SNS, SNS, and SNS + VNS for 10 days. In another experiment, after 10 days of 4% DSS (dextran sodium sulfate) in drinking water, rats were treated with 10-day sham-SNS and SNS. Various inflammatory responses were assessed; mechanisms involving autonomic functions and inflammatory cytokines were investigated.(a) VNS, SNS, and VNS + SNS significantly and equally decreased the disease activity index and macroscopic scores, and normalized colon length; () IL-10 was decreased by TNBS but increased with SNS, VNS, and SNS + VNS; pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-17A, MCP-1 and TNF-α, were increased by TNBS but decreased with SNS, VNS, and SNS + VNS (P < .05); MPO activity was decreased by SNS, VNS, and SNS + VNS; (c) SNS, VNS, and SNS + VNS remarkably increased vagal activity that was suppressed by TNBS (P < .05); (d) smilar SNS effects were noted in rats with DSS-induced .SNS presents similar anti-inflammatory effects as VNS by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines via the autonomic pathway. Similar to VNS, SNS may also have a therapeutic potential for colonic inflammation.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181736>Replication of Crohn's Disease Mucosal  Isolates inside Macrophages Correlates with Resistance to Superoxide and Is Dependent on Macrophage NF-kappa  Activation.</a></h2><p>Mucosa-associated  are increased in Crohn's disease (CD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). CD isolates replicate within macrophages but the specificity of this effect for CD and its mechanism are unclear. Gentamicin exclusion assay was used to assess  replication within J774.A1 murine macrophages.  growth was assessed following acid, low-nutrient, nitrosative, oxidative and superoxide stress, mimicking the phagolysosome. Twelve of 16 CD  isolates replicated >2-fold within J774.A1 macrophages; likewise for isolates from 6/7 urinary tract infection (UTI), 8/9 from healthy subjects, compared with 2/6 ulcerative , 2/7 colorectal cancer and 0/3 laboratory strains. CD mucosal  were tolerant of acidic, low-nutrient, nitrosative and oxidative stress. Replication within macrophages correlated strongly with tolerance to superoxide stress (rho = 0.44,  = 0.0009). Exemplar CD  HM605 and LF82 were unable to survive within  murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. In keeping with this, pre-incubation of macrophages with hydrocortisone (0.6 µM for 24 h) caused 70.49 ± 12.11% inhibition of intra-macrophage replication. Thus, CD mucosal  commonly replicate inside macrophages, but so do some UTI and healthy subject strains. Replication correlates with resistance to superoxide and is highly dependent on macrophage NF-κ signalling. This may therefore be a good therapeutic target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31484693>Bacterial immunogenic α-galactosylceramide identified in the murine large intestine: dependency on diet and inflammation.</a></h2><p>The glycosphingolipid α-galactosylceramide (αGalCer), when presented by CD1d on antigen presenting cells, efficiently activates invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells. Thereby, it modulates immune responses against tumors, microbial and viral infections and autoimmune diseases. Recently, the production of αGalCer by Bacteroidetes from the human gut microbiome was elucidated. Using hydrophilic interaction chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, we screened murine intestinal tracts to identify and quantify αGalCers, and we investigated the αGalCer response to different dietary and physiologic conditions. In both the caecum and the colon of mice, we found 1-15 pmol αGalCer/mg protein; in contrast, mice lacking microbiota (germ-free mice) and fed identical diet did not harbor αGalCer. The identified αGalCer contained a β(R)-hydroxylated hexadecanoyl chain N-linked to C18-sphinganine, which differed from what has been reported with Bacteroides fragilis. (Unlike β-anomeric structures, but similar to αGalCers from . fragilis, the synthetic form of the murine αGalCer induced iNKT cell activation in vitro. Last, we observed a decrease in αGalCer production in mice exposed to conditions that alter the composition of the gut microbiota, including Western type diet, , and influenza A virus infection. Collectively, this study suggests that αGalCer is produced by commensals in the mouse intestine and reveals that stressful conditions causing dysbiosis alter its synthesis. The consequences of this altered production on iNKT cell-mediated local and systemic immune responses are worthy of future studies.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31549186>[Periodic fever and pancytopenia in a 35-year-old patient].</a></h2><p>A 35-year-old patient with a previous history of persistent episodic fever, sore throat, myalgia, and cephalgia presented for evaluation of pancytopenia.

We applied machine learning to identify the best predictors of amyloidosis in rhesus macaques from available clinical and pathology records. To explore potential biomarkers, we also assessed whether changes in circulating serum amyloid A (SAA) or lipoprotein profiles accompany the disease.  We conducted a retrospective study using 86 cases and 163 controls matched for age and sex. We performed data reduction on 62 clinical, pathological and demographic variables, and applied multivariate modelling and model selection with cross-validation. To test the performance of our final model, we applied it to a replication cohort of 2,775 macaques.  The strongest predictors of disease were , gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma, endometriosis, arthritis, trauma, diarrhoea and number of pregnancies. Sensitivity and specificity of the risk model were predicted to be 82%, and were assessed at 79 and 72%, respectively. Total, low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly lower, and SAA levels and triglyceride-to-HDL ratios were significantly higher in cases versus controls.  Machine learning is a powerful approach to identifying macaques at risk of AA amyloidosis, which is accompanied by increased circulating SAA and altered lipoprotein profiles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31117153>Autonomically mediated anti-inflammatory effects of electrical stimulation at acupoints in a rodent model of colonic inflammation.</a></h2><p>Acupuncture has been widely accepted for treatments of many diseases.

The aim of this study was to define the characteristics of IBD, the trends and phenotype among IBD patients in Romania.  We conducted a prospective study over a period of 12 years, from 2006 to 2017. All patients diagnosed with IBD on clinical, radiological, endoscopic and histological features were included. We divided the country into eight regions: west (W), north-east (NE), north-west (NW), south-east (SE), south-west (SW), south (S), central (C) and Bucharest-Ilfov (), and data were analyzed accordingly.  A total of 2724 patients were included in this database, but only 2248 were included in the final analysis, with all data available. Of the 2248 patients, 935 were Crohn's disease (CD), 1263 were ulcerative  (UC) and 50 were IBD-undetermined. In UC phenotypes we observed more frequent left-sided  (50.5%,  < 0.0001), and in CD phenotype we observed more frequent colonic and ileo-colonic localization (37.8% and 37.6%,  < 0.0001). The region with the most IBD cases was NE (25.1%) and with the least IBD cases was SW (4.9%). UC was found more frequently in NE (32%), while CD was found more frequently in Bucharest (28.6%).  In Romania, ulcerative  is more frequent than CD. UC is predominant in the northern part of Romania, while CD has become predominant in the southern part of the country. IBD occurs more in the male population, and in urban and industrialized areas.

An Excel-based decision-analytic model was developed to evaluate costs from the perspective of a third-party US payer over 2 years. Efficacy and safety parameters were taken from prescribing information and published trials. All patients started induction therapy on the first treatment in the strategy and continued if efficacy criteria were met and no major adverse event occurred (in which cases they proceeded to the next treatment in the strategy).  The cost per member per month (PMPM) of the TOFA->IFX->VEDO->GOL strategy ($1.11) was lower than that of the ADA->IFX->VEDO->GOL strategy ($1.34; Δ = $-0.23) among the TNFi-naïve population ( = 204 patients out of a plan of one million members). Similarly, the use of TOFA before ADA (i.e. TOFA->ADA->IFX-> VEDO) was also associated with lower PMPM costs than the use of ADA before TOFA (i.e. ADA->TOFA->IFX->VEDO): $1.15 vs $1.25 (Δ = $-0.10). Similar, and often larger, differences were observed in both the overall moderate-to-severe population and the TNFi-exposed population. Sensitivity analyses resulted in the same conclusions.  Our model relied on efficacy data from prescribing information and published trials, which were not head-to-head and slightly differed with respect to methods. Additionally, our model used representative minor and major ADRs (and the associated costs) to represent toxicity management, which was a simplifying assumption.  This analysis, the first of its kind to evaluate TOFA vis-à-vis other advanced therapies in the US, suggests the early use of TOFA among both TNFi-naïve and TNFi-failure patients results in lower PMPM costs compared with other treatment alternatives.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30965640>Analysis of Association Between Dietary Intake and Red Blood Cell Count Results in Remission Ulcerative  Individuals.</a></h2><p> The anemia is the most common extra-intestinal manifestation of the ulcerative .

A total of 103 patients were enrolled in our study, which included 30 healthy subjects, 41 patients with early-stage UC, and 32 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Methylation status of cyclooxygenase 2 () and human RUNT-related transcription factor 3 () genes in colonic mucosa from 3 groups of subjects were detected by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The SNPs  rs1800629 and  rs1143627 were genotyped by PCR and direct sequencing.  The methylation rate of  gene within CRC group was 35.7%, which was significantly higher than the other two groups (Healthy control 5.9%, UC 15.4%,  = .040). There was no significant difference in the methylation rate of  between early-stage UC group and healthy control group ( = .633). The methylation rate of  gene, the genotypes (GG, AG) and alleles (A, G) of rs1800629, and the genotypes (CC,CT,TT) and alleles (C,T) of rs1143627 were not statistically different among three groups.  In the early stage of UC, the methylation rate of cancer-related genes  and  and SNPs  rs1800629 and  rs1143627 were not significantly different compared with healthy subjects.

Rats in the normal group received no treatment. Rats in the model group were used to establish a UC model. Meanwhile, rats in the inhibitor group underwent intraperitoneal injection of inhibitor and establishment of the UC model. Subsequently, specimens were obtained for detection. Immunohistochemistry was applied to measure the expression of mTOR. Western blotting was adopted to determine the relative protein expressions of P85, P110 and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to detect the mRNA expression of miR-223. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was utilized to determine cell apoptosis. Furthermore, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted to measure the content of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and IL-6.Immunohistochemistry showed that the positive expression of mTOR increased remarkably in the model group and inhibitor group when compared with that of the normal group (p<0.05). However, it decreased notably in the inhibitor group when compared with the model group (p<0.05). Western blotting indicated that the protein expressions of P85, P110 and p-Akt in model group and inhibitor group were significantly higher than the ones of the normal group (p<0.05). However, the inhibitor group showed markedly lower relative protein expressions of P85, P110 and p-Akt than the ones of the model group (p<0.05). Compared with the normal group, the expression level of miR-223 was significantly elevated in model group and inhibitor group (p<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the mRNA expression of miR-233 between the model group and the inhibitor group (p>0.05). The apoptosis rate of the cells increased prominently in the model group and in the inhibitor group when compared with the normal group (p<0.05). However, it was remarkably reduced in the inhibitor group than the model group (p<0.05). In comparison with the normal group, the content of IL-1β and IL-6 was significantly up-regulated in the model group and in the inhibitor group (p<0.05). However, it declined notably in the inhibitor group compared with the model group (p<0.05).MiR-223 can trigger cell apoptosis and inflammation in UC by up-regulating the PI3K/Akt-mTOR signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31130074>Enterohemorrhagic  Tir inhibits TAK1 activation and mediates immune evasion.</a></h2><p>Many pathogens infect hosts through various immune evasion strategies. However, the molecular mechanisms by which pathogen proteins modulate and evade the host immune response remain unclear. Enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC) is a pathological strain that can induce mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (Erk, Jnk and p38 MAPK) and NF-κ pathway activation and proinflammatory cytokine production, which then causes diarrheal diseases such as hemorrhagic  and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Transforming growth factor β-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) is a key regulator involved in distinct innate immune signalling pathways. Here we report that EHEC translocated intimin receptor (Tir) protein inhibits the expression of EHEC-induced proinflammatory cytokines by interacting with the host tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, which is dependent on the phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs). Mechanistically, the association of EHEC Tir with SHP-1 facilitated the recruitment of SHP-1 to TAK1 and inhibited TAK1 phosphorylation, which then negatively regulated K63-linked polyubiquitination of TAK1 and downstream signal transduction. Taken together, these results suggest that EHEC Tir negatively regulates proinflammatory responses by inhibiting the activation of TAK1, which is essential for immune evasion and could be a potential target for the treatment of bacterial infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624262>Targeting the mTOR pathway uncouples the efficacy and toxicity of PD-1 blockade in renal transplantation.</a></h2><p>Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) use remains a challenge in patients with solid organ allografts as most would undergo rejection. In a melanoma patient in whom programmed-death 1 (PD-1) blockade resulted in organ rejection and , the addition of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus resulted in ongoing anti-tumor efficacy while promoting allograft tolerance. Strong granzyme , interferon (IFN)-γ CD8 cytotoxic T cell and circulating regulatory T (T) cell responses were noted during allograft rejection, along with significant eosinophilia and elevated serum IL-5 and eotaxin levels. Co-treatment with sirolimus abated cytotoxic T cell numbers and eosinophilia, while elevated T cell numbers in the peripheral blood were maintained. Interestingly, numbers of IFN-γ CD4 T cells and serum IFN-γ levels increased with the addition of sirolimus treatment likely promoting ongoing anti-PD-1 efficacy.

Onion is one of the most commonly used plants in the traditional medicine for the management of various conditions including inflammatory and gastrointestinal diseases. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effects of onion particularly in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).To test the anti-inflammatory effects of onion bulb extract (OBE) in an IBD mouse model and the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects such as modulation of the expression and/or the activity profile of various pro-inflammatory molecules. was induced in mice by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) daily administration for 5 days. Animals were sacrificed, colons were removed and the severity of the inflammation was determined by the gross and histological assessments. The colonic level/activity of various cytokines and chemokines were measured using proteome profiling-based assay, western blotting, and immunofluorescence techniques.DSS-induced  was significantly reduced by the daily OBE treatment and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA, positive control), particularly at 100-200 mg/kg doses, at both the gross and histological levels. OBE was also shown to reduce colonic expression and activity of several pro-inflammatory molecules and signaling pathways, such as mitogen activated protein kinase family, mammalian target of rapamycin, cyclooxygenase-2, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. In addition, OBE reduced the expression of interferon-γ, various C-C and C-X-C chemokines, and molecules involved in the apoptotic machinery such as cytochrome c, caspase-3 and -8, -cell lymphoma-extra-large and -2.OBE showed anti-inflammatory actions in IBD mouse model, which is attributed, in part, to the modulation of the expression and the activity of important pro-inflammatory molecules and signaling pathways involved in the inflammatory response. These data suggest that OBE may be a promising lead in the therapeutic management of IBD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

The treatment of UC is imperative. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of nigeglanine on dextran sulfate sodium-induced UC in experimental mice and Caco-2 cells and define the underlying mechanism. The nigeglanine was shown a significant protective effect on the colon, significantly reduced the weight and colon length loss and inhibited intestinal epithelial cell damage. Nigeglanine also reduced proinflammatory factors and increased anti-inflammatory factor production. The results indicate that nigeglanine suppresses the nuclear factor kappa  and mitogen-activated protein kinases pathways in addition to NLRP3 inflammasome action, inhibiting colon epithelial cell pyroptosis. Surprisingly, ZO-1 and occludin protein levels increased with nigeglanine treatment, suggesting that nigeglanine plays a protective role in barrier integrity, reducing  progression.

Network pharmacology indicates the multiple interactions among genes, proteins, and metabolites associated with diseases and drugs from the network perspective, which shows the multi-component and multi-target attributes of TCM. This study predicted the pharmacological mechanism of Paeonia lactiflora in the treatment of UC by network pharmacological method. MATERIAL AND METHODS Chemical constituents of Paeonia lactiflora were searched from TCMSP data, gene names of target sites were extracted from UniProt database, and disease targets of ulcerative  were obtained from the CTD disease database. Use Venny online tools to obtain common targets for drugs and diseases. The DAVID database was used to enrich GO and KEGG for the common target, and the related functions and pathways were obtained. Cytoscape 3.7.1 was used to construct the 'drug-compound-target-disease' network. RESULTS There are 70 common target genes between Paeonia lactiflora and UC. GO analysis showed that the biological functions of the common target genes of Paeonia lactiflora and UC include response to lipopolysaccharide, response to estradiol, response to drug, positive regulation of nitric oxide biosynthetic process, and steroid hormone-mediated signaling pathway. Enrichment of the KEGG signaling pathway mainly involves signaling pathways, including Pathways in cancer, TNF signaling pathway, Tuberculosis, Hepatitis , and Toxoplasmosis. CONCLUSIONS The network pharmacology intuitively shows the multi-component, multi-target, and multi-channel pharmacological effects of Paeonia lactiflora on UC, and provides a scientific basis for studying the mechanism of the effect of Paeonia lactiflora on UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30950984>Hypogastric artery coverage during endovascular aneurysm repair in octogenarian and younger patients.</a></h2><p>To report our experience about hypogastric artery coverage during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for aortoiliac aneurysms in patients younger than 80 years (group A) compared with octogenarian patients (group ).Data of consecutive EVAR with hypogastric artery coverage from 01/1998 to 12/2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Primary outcomes were the occurrence of ischemic , type II endoleak and buttock claudication both at 30 days and in the long term. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.The hypogastric artery was covered in 107 patients. Twenty-three (21.5%) were octogenarian (group ). At 30 days, one type II endoleak occurred in group , whereas 16 patients of group A experienced buttock claudication. There were no cases of ischemic . During follow-up (median 63.5 months), no cases of ischemic  occurred. Six new type II endoleaks were recorded (five in group  and one in group A, P = 0.0001). Buttock claudication persisted in four patients of group A. No new cases of buttock claudication were observed.Unilateral hypogastric artery coverage during EVAR for aortoiliac aneurysms can be performed with an acceptable rate of postoperative complication.

However, no approved therapies directly target this activated subset of macrophages.First, we undertook to examine whether the folate receptor beta (FR-β) positive subpopulation of macrophages, which marks the inflammatory subset in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis, might constitute the prominent population of macrophages in inflamed lesions in humans. Next, we utilized anti-FR-β monoclonal antibodies capable of mediating antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) to treat animal models of rheumatoid arthritis and peritonitis.Human tissue samples of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, and scleroderma are all characterized by dramatic accumulation of macrophages that express FR-β, a protein not expressed on resting macrophages or any other healthy tissues. A monoclonal antibody to FR-β accumulates specifically in inflamed lesions of murine inflammatory disease models and successfully treats such models of rheumatoid arthritis and peritonitis. More importantly, elimination of FR-β-positive macrophages upon treatment with an anti-FR-β monoclonal antibody promotes the departure of other immune cells, including T cells,  cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells from the inflamed lesions.These data suggest that specific elimination of FR-β-expressing macrophages may constitute a highly specific therapy for multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and that a recently developed human anti-human FR-β monoclonal antibody (m909) might contribute to suppression of this subpopulation of macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504526>Immunogenicity of High Dose Influenza Vaccine for Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease on Anti-TNF Monotherapy: A Randomized Clinical Trial.</a></h2><p>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) agents may have lower immune response to the influenza vaccine.

Patients with UC usually suffer from a lifetime of debilitating physical symptoms. Therefore, developing effective therapeutic strategy that can manage this disease better and improve patients' life quality is in urgent need. Sesamin (SSM) is a lignan derived from sesame seeds. In this study, the protective effect of SSM against UC and the underlying mechanism were investigated  and . Our data showed that SSM protected Caco-2 cells from HO-induced oxidative stress injury via GSH-mediated scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dual luciferase reporter assay showed that the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was significantly increased by SSM, and the ability of SSM to activate Nrf2-targeted genes was further confirmed in Caco-2 cells using western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In contrast, Nrf2 knockdown abolished the protective effect of SSM. Additionally, we found that SSM also activated advanced protein kinase  (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in Caco-2 cells, while either AKT or ERK inhibition can prevent SSM-mediated nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Furthermore, SSM displayed a better protective effect against dextran sulfate sodium- (DSS-) induced UC compared with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) in C57BL/6 mice. The enhanced Nrf2 signaling and activated AKT/ERK were also observed in the colon of mice after SSM administration. These results first demonstrate the protective effect of SSM against UC and indicate that the effect is associated with AKT/ERK activation and subsequent Nrf2 signaling enhancement. This study provides a new insight into the medicinal value of SSM and proposes it as a new natural nutrition for better managing the symptoms of UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614203>Patchouli alcohol activates PXR and suppresses the NF-κ-mediated intestinal inflammatory.</a></h2><p>Pregnane-X-receptor (PXR) is involved in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patchouli alcohol (PA) has anti-inflammatory effects; however, the mechanisms of PA on IBD remain largely unknown.The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of PA that primarily focused on crosstalk between PA-mediated PXR activation and NF-κ inhibition.We evaluated the anti-inflammatory effect of PA with respect to PXR/NF-κ signalling using in vitro and in vivo models. In vitro, the identified PA as PXR agonist was evaluated by hPXR transactivation assays and assessing CYP3A4 expression and activity. NF-κ inhibition were analysed based on NF-κ Luciferase assays, NF-κ-mediated pro-inflammatory genes expression and NF-κ nuclear translocation after activating PXR by PA. In vivo, colonic mPXR and NF-κ signalling were analysed to assess PA-mediated the protective effect against dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced . Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of PXR was further evaluated the protection of PA against DSS-induced .PA induced CYP3A4 expression and activity via an hPXR-dependent mechanism. PA-mediated PXR activation attenuated inflammation by inhibiting NF-κ activity and nuclear translocation. The anti-inflammatory effect of PA on NF-κ was abolished by PXR knockdown. PA prevented DSS-induced inflammation by regulating PXR/NF-κ signalling, whereas pharmacological PXR inhibition abated PA-mediated suppressive effects on NF-κ inflammation signalling.PA activates PXR signalling and suppresses NF-κ signalling, consequently causing ameliorating inflammation. Results highlight the importance of PXR-NF-κ crosstalk in  and suggest a novel therapeutic reagent.Copyright © 2019.

During the last decade, the role of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the treatment of paediatric-onset IBD has gained more ground. The number of biologicals presently available for children and adolescents with IBD has increased, biosimilars have become available, and practices in adult gastroenterology with regards to anti-TNF have changed. The aim of this study is to review the current evidence on the indications, judicious use, effectiveness and safety of anti-TNF agents in paediatric IBD. A PubMed literature search was performed and included articles published after 2000 using the following terms: child or paediatric, Crohn, ulcerative , inflammatory bowel disease, anti-TNF, TNF alpha inhibitor, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab and biological. Anti-TNF agents, specifically infliximab and adalimumab, have proven to be effective in moderate and severe paediatric IBD. Therapeutic drug monitoring increases therapy effectiveness and safety. Clinical predictors for anti-TNF response are currently of limited value because of the variation in outcome definitions and follow-ups.

The symptoms can vary from severe diarrhea to the formation of pseudomembranous  and therefore trigger a need for new therapies. The initial step of disease is the binding of the bacterial enterotoxins toxin A and  to the cell surface of epithelial intestinal cells. Scavenging of the toxins is crucial to inhibit their fatal effect in the human body and circumvent the administration of antibiotics. Cell surface glycans are common as ligands for TcdA. Although crucial for carbohydrate-protein interactions, a multivalent presentation of glycans for binding has been hardly considered. Here, we establish a neo-glycoprotein-based glycan library to identify an effective multivalent glycan ligand for TcdA. It comprises 40 different glycan epitopes based on -acetyllactosamine precursors. Nine structures exhibit strong binding of the receptor domain. Among them, the Lewis-Lewis-epitope shows the best performance for binding both the receptor domain and the holotoxin. Therefore, the glycan was synthesized de novo and coupled to BSA as a scaffold for multivalent presentation. The corresponding neo-glycoprotein facilitates the proper scavenging of TcdA in vitro and effectively protects HT29 cells from TcdA-induced cell damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639187>Can we Improve the Prognostic Value of Phenotype at Inflammatory Bowel Disease Diagnosis?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30943899>Hepatobiliary and pancreatic manifestations in inflammatory bowel diseases: a referral center study.</a></h2><p>Hepatobiliary and pancreatic manifestations have been reported in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative .

Regarding hepatitis viruses, one-third of the patients had been tested for hepatitis  and C. 5% (12/225) of them had positive hepatitis  surface antigen and 13.4% had past infection with hepatitis  virus (positive anti-HBcore). In addition, most of the patients were not immune against hepatitis  (negative anti-HBs), while 3% of patients were anti-HCV positive and only one patient had active hepatitis C. Furthermore, 24 patients had drug-related side effects from the liver and pancreas. The side effects included 21 cases of hepatotoxicity and 3 cases of acute pancreatitis. Moreover, there were two cases of HBV reactivation and one case of chronic hepatitis C, which were successfully treated.In our study, approximately one out of four patients had some kind by a hepatobiliary or pancreatic manifestation.

Genome-wide association studies, followed by functional studies, have identified a role for numerous autophagy genes in IBD, especially in Crohn disease. Studies using  and  models, in addition to human clinical studies have revealed that autophagy is pivotal for intestinal homeostasis maintenance, gut ecology regulation, appropriate intestinal immune responses and anti-microbial protection. This review describes the latest researches on the mechanisms by which dysfunctional autophagy leads to disrupted intestinal epithelial function, gut dysbiosis, defect in anti-microbial peptide secretion by Paneth cells, endoplasmic reticulum stress response and aberrant immune responses to pathogenic bacteria. A better understanding of the role of autophagy in IBD pathogenesis may provide better sub-classification of IBD phenotypes and novel approaches for disease management.

The  cell epitopes of murine TNF‑α (mTNF‑α) were predicted in silico and coupled with the universal interleukin 1β (IL‑1β) helper T‑cell epitope peptide VQGEESNDK to synthesize the eight‑branched MAP vaccine. Then, the immunological effects of the MAP vaccine were assessed in vitro and in vivo, as well as its impacts on DAI index, serum DAO levels, colon tissue tight junction protein amounts, ultrastructural changes, and MPO activity in BALB/c mice with UC. The amino acids LTLRSSSQNSSDKPV at positions 78‑92 of mTNF‑α may constitute the dominant  cell epitope. Based on this finding, an eight‑branched peptide structure, the TNF‑α ‑cell epitope/IL‑1β helper T‑cell epitope complex MAP vaccine, was synthesized. Indirect ELISA confirmed that MAP had a high affinity with commercialized mTNF‑α antibodies. Meanwhile, MAP induced high specific antibody titers in vivo, reduced the DAI score, serum MPO activity, colorectal lymph node colony count, ultrastructural injuries, colon tissue histological index score and MPO activity in UC mice, while increasing the expression levels of occludin, claudin1 and ZO1 in colon tissues. The synthetic complex MAP vaccine has good antigenicity and immunogenicity, and can alleviate UC in mouse models.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31097594>Enhanced susceptibility to chemically induced  caused by excessive endosomal TLR signaling in LRBA-deficient mice.</a></h2><p>LPS-responsive beige-like anchor (LRBA) protein deficiency in humans causes immune dysregulation resulting in autoimmunity, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), hypogammaglobulinemia, regulatory T (T) cell defects, and  cell functional defects, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible are incompletely understood. In an ongoing forward genetic screen for -ethyl--nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutations that increase susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced  in mice, we identified two nonsense mutations in  Although T cells have been a main focus in LRBA research to date, we found that dendritic cells (DCs) contribute significantly to DSS-induced intestinal inflammation in LRBA-deficient mice.   DCs exhibited excessive IRF3/7- and PI3K/mTORC1-dependent signaling and type I IFN production in response to the stimulation of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3, TLR7, and TLR9. Substantial reductions in cytokine expression and sensitivity to DSS in LRBA-deficient mice were caused by knockout of , a chaperone necessary for trafficking of TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 to endosomes. Our data support a function for LRBA in limiting endosomal TLR signaling and consequent intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30972059>Mesenteric Lymphatic Alterations Observed During DSS Induced Intestinal Inflammation Are Driven in a TLR4-PAMP/DAMP Discriminative Manner.</a></h2><p> Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by both acute and chronic phase inflammation of the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract that affect a large and growing number of people worldwide with little to no effective treatments. This is in part due to the lack of understanding of the disease pathogenesis and also the currently poorly described involvement of other systems such as the lymphatics. During DSS induced , mice also develop a severe inflammation of terminal ileum with many features similar to IBD. As well as inflammation within the ileum we have previously demonstrated lymphatic remodeling within the mesentery and mesenteric lymph nodes of DSS-treated mice. The lymphatic remodeling includes lymphangiogenesis, lymphatic vessel dilation and leakiness, as well as cellular infiltration into the surrounding tissue and peripheral draining lymph nodes.  Intestinal inflammation was induced in C57BL/6 mice by administration of 2.5% DSS in drinking water for 7 days. Mice were treated with TLR4 blocker C34 or Polymyxin- (PMXB) daily from days 3 to 7 of DSS treatment via I.P. injection, and their therapeutic effects on disease activity and lymphatic function were examined. TLR activity and subsequent effect on lymphangiogenesis, lymphadenopathy, and mesenteric lymph node cellular composition were assessed.  DSS Mice treated with TLR4 inhibitor, C34, had a significantly improved disease phenotype characterized by reduced ileal and colonic insult. The change correlated with significant reduction in colonic and mesenteric inflammation, resolved mesenteric lymphangiectasia, and CD103 DC migration similar to that of healthy control. PMXB treatment however did not resolve inflammation within the colon or associated mesenteric lymphatic dysfunction but did however prevent lymphadenopathy within the MLN through alteration of CCL21 gradients and CD103 DC migration.  TLR4 appears to mediate several changes within the mesenteric lymphatics, more specifically it is shown to have different outcomes whether stimulation occurs through pathogen derived factors such as LPS or tissue derived DAMPs, a novel phenomenon.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982369>Granulocyte-monocyte apheresis: an alternative combination therapy after loss of response to anti-TNF agents in ulcerative .</a></h2><p> To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the combination of granulocyte-monocyte apheresis (GMA) after loss of response (LOR) to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents in ulcerative  (UC).  A retrospective, multicenter study was performed in 11 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) Units. Clinical remission was defined as a partial Mayo score ≤2. The effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated by the partial Mayo score and the rate of anti-TNF intensification, switch, swap or colectomy.  Forty-seven patients with ulcerative  were included (mean age 35 years, mean disease duration 52 months, 66% male and 59% extensive ). Twenty-three subjects were receiving infliximab, eighteen adalimumab and six golimumab. GMA was combined after a primary non-response (49%) or secondary loss of response (51%) to anti-TNF therapy. We observed a significant decrease in partial Mayo score and fecal calprotectin after GMA. Fifteen patients (32%) responded to the combination therapy without anti-TNF intensification, switch, swap or colectomy. Eight patients (17%) underwent colectomy. Two patients (4%) presented adverse events related to the technique.  Combination of GMA and anti-tumor necrosis factor is a safe and effective treatment after the loss of response to these biologic agents, with a significant decrease of the clinical disease activity and biomarkers, in a population with limited therapeutic alternatives.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31150744>Shiga toxin-induced haemolytic uraemic syndrome and the role of antibiotics: a global overview.</a></h2><p>The administration of antibiotics in infections caused by Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) strains, such as O157:H7, was and remains controversial, as it has been associated with the development of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). We conducted a literature review to better examine this association.We searched the PubMed and Google Scholar databases for relevant articles, using the key words: ``haemolytic uraemic syndrome'', ``Shiga toxin'', ``E. coli O157:H7'', ``E. coli O104:H4'', ``STEC '', ``STEC antibiotics'', ``STEC fosfomycin'', ``STEC trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole'', ``STEC fluoroquinolones'', ``STEC ciprofloxacin'', ``STEC rifaximin'', ``STEC gentamycin'', ``STEC colistin'', "Shiga toxin binding agent", "Shiga toxin monoclonal antibody" and ``STEC Japan epidemic''.Numerous studies report that antibiotics increase the risk of HUS development, while others report that antibiotics do not have any effect or can even reduce the rate of HUS development in STEC infections. The infecting STEC strain, the type of antibiotic as well as the timing of its administration appear to significantly affect the development of HUS in a STEC infected patient.It appears that, while some antibiotics such as -lactams and TMP/SMX may be detrimental, others appear to be safe and can prevent the development of HUS. Of note, fosfomycin appears to be the antibiotic with the most positive results from clinical studies, and may be able to avert HUS development, especially if administered within the first two or three days from diarrhoea onset. Fluoroquinolones have also shown positive outcomes in clinical studies, despite demonstrating unfavourable results in in vitro studies. Other agents, such as colistin, gentamycin and rifamycins, have shown promising results in in vitro studies and require further evaluation.Copyright © 2019.

We studied intestinal tissue remodeling by quantifying ECM protein fragments in serum in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced , to investigate ECM protein fragments as serological biomarkers of intestinal tissue remodeling and disease activity.Male Sprague-Dawley rats received 5% DSS in drinking water for 5 days followed by 11 days with regular water. Disease activity index (DAI) was scored daily. Serum was collected on day 0, 6, 7, and 16. ELISAs were used to quantify MMP-derived remodeling fragments of basement membrane type IV collagen (C4M and PRO-C4) and interstitial matrix type III collagen (C3M and rPRO-C3).In DSS rats, serum levels relative to baseline of C4M, PRO-C4, and C3M were elevated (P < 0.01; P < 0.001; P < 0.001) at day 7, which declined at day 16. Levels of rPRO-C3 were lower in DSS rats at day 7 and increased to normal levels at day 16. The ratio between C3M and rPRO-C3 showed an overall degradation (P < 0.0001) of collagen type III in DSS rats at day 7, which correlated to the DAI (r = 0.5588, P < 0.0001).Our data suggest that remodeling of the basement membrane (C4M and PRO-C4) and the interstitial matrix (C3M and rPRO-C3) increased during DSS-induced  and declined with reversal of the disease. Thus, serological biochemical biomarkers of the ECM reflect tissue remodeling and could be studied as markers of disease activity in IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627218>Prophylactic Effect of Opuntia ficus indica Fruit Peel Extract against Irradiation-Induced Colon Injury in Rats.</a></h2><p> extract has been used in traditional folk medicine for several purposes and exhibits anti-inflammatory properties. This study was directed to explore the prophylactic effect of  fruit peel extract against irradiation-induced  in rats. GC/MS analysis of the petroleum ether extract led to recognition of 33 compounds in the unsaponifiable fraction and 15 fatty acid methyl esters in the saponifiable part. Thirteen terpenes and sterols were isolated and identified from which ten compounds were not isolated from any part of this species before. Data showed that irradiation induced colon injury as manifested by elevated contents of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, myeloperoxidase, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, cyclooxygenase-2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and nuclear factor kappa , while it reduced superoxide dismutase activity and interleukin 10 content in colonic tissues, which was confirmed by histopathological examination. Pretreatment with  extract attenuated the alteration in the measured parameters. It could be concluded that  fruit peel extract can be regarded as a potential agent in limiting colonic complications due to irradiation, possibly by its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628842>The Ulcerative  Response Index for Detection of Mucosal Healing in Patients Treated With Anti-tumour Necrosis Factor.</a></h2><p>Surrogate markers that accurately detect mucosal healing [MH] in patients with ulcerative  [UC] are urgently needed. Several stool neutrophil-related proteins are currently used as biomarkers for MH. However, the sensitivity and specificity are not sufficient to avoid unnecessary endoscopic evaluations.Novel serum neutrophil-related markers (neutrophil gelatinase -associated lipocalin and matrix metalloproteinase-9 [NGAL-MMP-9 complex], cathelicidin LL-37 and chitinase 3-like 1 [CHI3L1]), together with C-reactive protein [CRP] and neutrophil counts were studied. Serum samples were obtained from 176 anti-tumour necrosis factor [anti-TNF]-treated UC patients (145 infliximab [IFX] and 31 adalimumab [ADM]) at baseline and after a median of 9.5 weeks. All patients had active disease prior to treatment (Mayo endoscopic subscore [MES] ≥ 2), and MH was defined as MES ≤ 1. Serum was also obtained from 75 healthy controls. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to generate the Ulcerative  Response Index [UCRI]. The performance of individual markers and UCRI was tested with receiver operating characteristic analysis.All neutrophil-related markers were significantly higher in active UC patients compared to healthy controls. In the IFX cohort, CRP, NGAL-MMP-9, CHI3L1 and neutrophil count decreased significantly after treatment and all marker levels were significantly lower in healers compared to non-healers following IFX. In the ADM cohort, CRP, NGAL-MMP-9, CHI3L1 and neutrophil count decreased significantly only in healers. UCRI [including CRP, CHI3L1, neutrophil count and LL-37] accurately detected MH in both IFX-treated (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.83) and ADM-treated [AUC = 0.79] patients.The new UCRI index accurately detects MH after treatment with IFX and ADM. This panel is useful for monitoring MH in UC patients under anti-TNF treatment.This article has an associated podcast which can be accessed at https://academic.oup.com/ecco-jcc/pages/podcast.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

Our previous research indicated that the regulatory immune responses induced by H. pylori infection were not limited to gastric mucosa, and the balance of intestinal mucosal immunity was influenced. In this study, mice were infected with H. pylori SS1, and then  was induced by 3% dextran sulphate sodium (DSS), to investigate the role of the regulatory  cells in the effects of H. pylori infection on acute and chronic . In acute and chronic  groups, DAI and colonic histological scores reduced significantly and colon length shorted less, the proinflammatory cytokines mRNA expression downregulated in colonic mucosa, and the percentages of CD19IL-10Breg cells were higher in the H. pylori/DSS co-treated groups compared with the DSS-treated groups. Our study suggests that H. pylori infection can alleviate the acute and chronic  induced by DSS, and CD19IL-10Breg cells may play a critical role in the alleviation of acute and chronic  following H. pylori infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31107556>Attenuation of NF-κ in Intestinal Epithelial Cells Is Sufficient to Mitigate the Bone Loss Comorbidity of Experimental Mouse .</a></h2><p>Skeletal abnormalities are common comorbidities of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients suffering from IBD, including ulcerative  and Crohn's disease, present with skeletal complications. However, the mechanism underpinning IBD-associated bone loss remains vague. Intestinal inflammation generates an inflammatory milieu at the intestinal epithelium that leads to dysregulation of mucosal immunity through gut-residing innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and other cell types. ILCs are recently identified mucosal cells considered as the gatekeeper of gut immunity and their function is regulated by intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-secreted cytokines in response to the inflammatory microenvironment. We first demonstrate that serum as well as IECs collected from the intestine of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  mice contain high levels of inflammatory and osteoclastogenic cytokines. Mechanistically, heightened inflammatory response of IECs was associated with significant intrinsic activation of NF-κ (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells) in IECs and increased frequency of ILC1, ILC3, and myeloid osteoclast progenitors. Validating the central role of IEC-specific NF-κ activation in this phenomenon, conditional expression of constitutively active inhibitor kappa  kinase 2 (IKK2) in IECs in mice recapitulates the majority of the cellular, inflammatory, and osteolytic phenotypes observed in the chemically induced . Furthermore, conditional deletion of IKK2 from IECs significantly attenuated inflammation and bone loss in DSS-induced . Finally, using the DSS-induced  model, pharmacologic inhibition of IKK2 was effective in reducing frequency of ILC1 and ILC3 cells, attenuated circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines, and halted -associated bone loss. Our findings identify IKK2 in IECs as viable therapeutic target for -associated osteopenia.© 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672153>Effect of Enterococcus faecalis 2001 on  and depressive-like behavior in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice: involvement of the brain-gut axis.</a></h2><p>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including those with ulcerative  and Crohn's disease, have higher rates of psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety; however, the mechanism of psychiatric disorder development remains unclear. Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa  (NFκ) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκ p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκ p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκ p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest a close relationship between IBD and depression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30963020>Effect of Shogaol on the Expression of Intestinal Stem Cell Markers in Experimentally Induced  in BALB/c Mice.</a></h2><p>This study is aimed at investigating the effect of Shogaol, a phenolic constituent of ginger, on dextran sodium sulfate- (DSS-) induced ulcerative  (UC) in mice in comparison with 6-thioguanine (6-TG), an immune-suppressant chemotherapeutic medicine used for treatment of ulcerative .Thirty-six adult, male and female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into six groups: group 1 (control negative) not exposed to DSS and did not receive any treatment, group 2 (control positive) exposed to DSS but did not receive any treatment, group 3 exposed to DSS and treated by 0.1 mg/kg of 6-thioguanine, and groups 4, 5, and 6 exposed to DSS and treated by 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg .w. Shogaol, respectively. At day 56, the mice were checked for their disease activity index (DAI) and they were sacrificed. The colons of the mice were examined for length measurement, histological index score, and the expression of CD133 and CD34 stem cell markers.Shogaol showed a better curative effect than did 6-TG in repairing the colonic mucosal damages in DSS-exposed mice as indicated by the levels of CD133 and CD34 expression in the colonic crypts and by the DAI score, colon length measurements, & histological index score which were significantly reduced in mice treated by Shogaol, particularly the 20 and 40 mg/kg BW doses.The results of this study indicated that oral treatment with the ginger-derived substance Shogaol could be better than the conventional immunosuppressive chemotherapeutic remedy 6-TG in treatment of DSS-induced UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632588>TNF-α and IFN-γ synergistically inhibit the repairing ability of mesenchymal stem cells on mice  and colon cancer.</a></h2><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be efficiently recruited to wound, inflammatory and tumor sites to repair and regenerate tissue. However, its role in  and  associated colon cancer is still controversial. This study was designed to evaluate the role and mechanisms of inflammatory cytokines-activated-MSCs in mice  and colon cancer.We selected two well-characterized pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), to expand the inflammatory microenvironment of MSCs. The severity of  and colon cancer was evaluated by measuring colon length, Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, Hematoxylin-eosin staining, Western Blot, Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence. These techniques were also performed to analyze the mechanisms of inflammatory cytokines-activated-MSCs in mice  and colon cancer. Real-time PCR and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) were used to measure the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors.We found that the incubation of MSCs with TNF-α and IFN-γ aggravates , where high levels of pro-inflammatory factors, such as interleukin (IL)-17, IL-8, IL-12, IL-1β, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, TNF-α and IFN-γ, were secreted. Furthermore, this phenomenon was associated with the activation of the nuclear factor-kappa- (NF-κ)/Signal transducer and activator of transcription three (STAT3) pathway. In addition, our study demonstrated that TNF-α and IFN-γ pretreated MSCs synergistically exacerbated mice colon cancer, which was closely associated with angiogenesis.Taken together, these results indicate that TNF-α and IFN-γ pretreatment effectively inhibited the repair ability of MSCs and accelerated inflammation and tumor progression involving NF-κ/STAT3 pathway and angiogenesis-related factors.AJTR Copyright © 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545974>Andrographolide inhibits inflammatory responses in LPS-stimulated macrophages and murine acute  through activating AMPK.</a></h2><p>Andrographolide (Andro), a well-known labdane diterpenoid of Andrographis paniculata, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects in various inflammatory disease models. Despite ongoing efforts to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Andro, its specific mechanism is not entirely clear. In this study, we confirmed the inhibitory effect of Andro on inflammatory activity and studied its mechanism in depth to find potential anti-inflammatory targets of Andro using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophages in vitro and a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse model of acute  in vivo. We found that Andro significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokines by suppressing nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and their upstream signaling pathways and activating the AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in LPS-induced macrophages. Interestingly, Andro could not regulate the activation of the AMPK/NF-κ/MAPK pathway nor inhibit NF-κ and activator protein 1 (AP-1) nuclear translocation and nitric oxide (NO) production following knockdown of AMPKα2. Moreover, Andro attenuated DSS-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction and inflammation by suppressing the NF-κ and MAPK pathways in colon tissues while activating the AMPK pathway. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that Andro effectively inhibits LPS-induced inflammatory responses via AMPK activation in macrophages, whereby Andro can ameliorate DSS-induced acute  in mice.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that the microbiota influences systemic iron homeostasis in mouse  models by altering inflammation-induced expression of the iron-regulating hormone hepcidin. In the present study, we examined the impact of the gut commensal bacterium Bacteroides fragilis on the expression of the iron exporter ferroportin, the target of hepcidin action, in macrophages, the cell type that plays a pivotal role in iron recycling. Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages were exposed to . fragilis and were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. We found that . fragilis down-regulated ferroportin transcription independently of bacterial viability. Medium conditioned by the bacteria also reduced ferroportin expression, indicating the involvement of soluble factors, possibly Toll-like receptor ligands. Consistent with this idea, several of these ligands were able to down-regulate ferroportin. The . fragilis-induced decrease in ferroportin was functionally important since it produced a significant increase in intracellular iron concentrations that prevented the effects of the iron chelator deferoxamine on Salmonella-induced IL-6 and IL-1β production. Our results thus reveal that . fragilis can influence macrophage iron handling and inflammatory responses by modulating ferroportin expression.©2019 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586453>Effects of Low-FODMAP Diet on Symptoms, Fecal Microbiome, and Markers of Inflammation in Patients With Quiescent Inflammatory Bowel Disease in a Randomized Trial.</a></h2><p>There is limited evidence that a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) reduces gut symptoms in quiescent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We performed a randomized, controlled trial to investigate the effects of a low-FODMAP diet on persistent gut symptoms, the intestinal microbiome, and circulating markers of inflammation in patients with quiescent IBD.We performed a single-blind trial of 52 patients with quiescent Crohn's disease or ulcerative  and persistent gut symptoms at 2 large gastroenterology clinics in the United Kingdom. Patients were randomly assigned to groups that followed a diet low in FODMAPs (n=27) or a control diet (n=25), with dietary advice, for 4 weeks. Gut symptoms and health-related quality of life were measured using validated questionnaires. Stool and blood samples were collected at baseline and end of trial. We assessed fecal microbiome composition and function using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and phenotypes of T cells in blood using flow cytometry.A higher proportion of patients reported adequate relief of gut symptoms following the low-FODMAP diet (14/27, 52%) than the control diet (4/25, 16%, P=.007). Patients had a greater reduction in irritable bowel syndrome severity scores following the low-FODMAP diet (mean reduction of 67; standard error, 78) than the control diet (mean reduction of 34; standard error, 50), although this difference was not statistically significant (P=.075). Following the low-FODMAP diet, patients had higher health-related quality of life scores (81.9±1.2) than patients on the control diet (78.3±1.2, P=.042). A targeted analysis revealed that in stool samples collected at the end of the study period, patients on the low-FODMAP diet had significantly lower abundance of Bifidobacterium adolescentis,  longum, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii than patients on control diet. However, microbiome diversity and markers of inflammation did not differ significantly between groups.In a trial of the low-FODMAP diet vs a control diet in patients with quiescent IBD, we found no significant difference after 4 weeks in change in irritable bowel syndrome severity scores, but significant improvements in specific symptom scores and numbers reporting adequate symptom relief. The low-FODMAP diet reduced fecal abundance of microbes believed to regulate the immune response, compared with the control diet, but had no significant effect on markers of inflammation. We conclude that a 4-week diet low in FODMAPs is safe and effective for managing persistent gut symptoms in patients with quiescent IBD. www.isrctn.com no: ISRCTN17061468.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was first assessed, and then, the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Fisher exact test were used for etiologic group comparisons. Distribution of patients' characteristics across genotypes was evaluated by the Fisher exact test, while that across alleles was analyzed with a probit model. A 2-sided value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Following the evidence of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we found a higher prevalence of the allele A of the -374T/A haplotype in UC (p = 0.043), and of the allele C of the -429T/C haplotype in CD (p < 0.001) with respect to the other groups. Moreover, the homozygous AA genotype of the -374T/A polymorphism resulted associated with late onset of CD, while its TT genotype with early onset (p = 0.049). The allele C of the 429T/C haplotype was associated with early onset of UC (p = 0.03), while a higher frequency of the heterozygous TC haplotype was found in those with pancolitis (p = 0.026). The differing distribution of these polymorphisms in healthy donors and CD/UC patients suggests a role in the development and outcome of these pathological conditions.</p></html>
