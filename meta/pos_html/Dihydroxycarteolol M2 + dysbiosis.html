Current biomarkers or their combinations cannot adequately predict IBD risk, diagnosis, progression or relapse, and response to therapy. Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) is emerging as a significant mediator of the inflammatory process. We aimed to assess levels of serum PKM2 in healthy and newly diagnosed IBD patients and its relationship with IBD indices and  changes.IBD serum samples from newly diagnosed patients were collected and analyzed using a PKM2-ELISA and correlated with disease activity scores, IBD disease type, and intestinal . Furthermore, we tested the genetic and protein expression of PKM2 in an in vitro intestinal cell model of inflammation.Serum PKM2 levels were 6-fold higher in IBD patients compared to healthy controls, with no sensitivity to disease phenotype (Crohn's Disease or Ulcerative Colitis) or localization of inflammation. Serum PKM2 had considerably less interindividual variability than established IBD fecal biomarkers. A positive Pearson correlation (r=0.6121) existed between serum PKM2 and Bacteroidetes fecal levels in Crohn's disease (CD), while a negative (r=-0.6128) correlation was observed with Actinobacteria fecal levels. Furthermore, LPS (500ng/mL) significantly increased PKM2 expression in vitro, which was significantly suppressed by an anti-inflammatory flaxseed bioactive agent.Our data suggests PKM2 as a putative biomarker for IBD and the dysbiosis of microflora in CD. Investigations involving larger number of clinical patients are necessary to validate its use as a serum biomarker of IBD.Copyright © 2017 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

We report that gut dysbiosis induced by antibiotic (Abx) treatment promotes allergic airway inflammation by shifting macrophage polarization in the lung toward the alternatively activated  phenotype. Adoptive transfer of alveolar macrophages derived from Abx-treated mice was sufficient to increase allergic airway inflammation. Abx treatment resulted in the overgrowth of a commensal fungal Candida species in the gut and increased plasma concentrations of prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂), which induced  macrophage polarization in the lung. Suppression of PGE₂ synthesis by the cyclooxygenase inhibitors aspirin and celecoxib suppressed  macrophage polarization and decreased allergic airway inflammatory cell infiltration in Abx-treated mice. Thus, Abx treatment can cause overgrowth of particular fungal species in the gut and promote  macrophage activation at distant sites to influence systemic responses including allergic inflammation.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Fecal -pyruvate kinase (-PK) is a biomarker indicative of cellular proliferation that may be raised in intestinal malignancy and inflammation. Biomarkers, including -PK, may be useful in assessing effects of novel therapies on the gastrointestinal tract.-PK was measured in stools collected from patients with CF and HC (0-10years). Linear mixed model analysis was used.-PK levels did not significantly change in children with CF (36 patients, 77 samples) (P=0.998) or HC (45 patients, 45 samples) (P=0.21), over the age range 0-10years. Patients with CF had elevated -PK compared to HC (median [IQR; range]: 10.7 [5.7-28.6; 1.0-239.1] (n=77) vs. 1.0 [1.0-1.0; 1.0-50.0] (n=45) U/mL, respectively; P=0.001).Fecal -PK was elevated in children with CF compared with HC during infancy and throughout childhood suggesting abnormalities in the CF gut exist in early life.Copyright © 2017 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.

Many studies have highlighted how this category of bacteria is very important for the good development, functioning, and maintenance of our immune system. There is a delicate balance between the immune system, located under the gut epithelial barrier, and the , but many factors can induce a disequilibrium that leads to an inflammatory state and dysbiosis. The aim of this work is to verify the anti-inflammatory effects of a probiotic formulation of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium lactis, and Bifidobacterium longum (Serobioma).To mimic the natural host compartmentalization between probiotics and immune cells through the intestinal epithelial barrier in vitro, the transwell model was used. We focused on a particular subset of immune cells that play a key role in the mucosal immune system. The immunomodulatory effects of probiotic formulation were investigated in the human macrophage cell line THP1 and macrophages derived from ex vivo human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Probiotic formulation induced a significant increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) production and was able to decrease the secretion of the major proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 by 70% and 80%, respectively. Finally, for the first time, the ability of probiotic formulation to favor the macrophage  phenotype has been identified.The transwell model is an intriguing toll approach to studying the human epithelial barrier.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Next to progressive airway disease, CF is also associated with intestinal inflammation and dysbiosis. Ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, has improved pulmonary and nutritional status but its effects on the intestinal  and inflammation are unclear. Hence, we assessed the changes on the intestinal microbial communities (16S rRNA variable 3 gene region) and inflammatory markers (calprotectin and -pyruvate kinase [-PK]) in 16 CF individuals (8 children and 8 adults) before and after (median 6.1 months) ivacaftor. Stool calprotectin significantly decreased following ivacaftor (median [IQR]: 154.4 [102.1-284.2] vs. 87.5 [19.5-190.2] mg/kg, P = 0.03). There was a significant increase in Akkermansia with ivacaftor. Increased abundance of Akkermansia was associated with normal stool -PK concentrations, and decreased abundances of Enterobacteriaceae correlated with decreased stool calprotectin concentrations. In summary, changes in the gut  and decrease in intestinal inflammation was associated with Ivacaftor treatment among individuals with CF carrying at least one gating CFTR mutation. Thus, CFTR-modifying therapy may adequately improve the aberrant pathophysiology and milieu of the CF gut to favor a more healthy , which in turn reduces intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30622429>Gut  Dysbiosis and Immunometabolism: New Frontiers for Treatment of Metabolic Diseases.</a></h2><p>Maintenance of healthy human metabolism depends on a symbiotic consortium among bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi, and host eukaryotic cells throughout the human gastrointestinal tract. Microbial communities provide the enzymatic machinery and the metabolic pathways that contribute to food digestion, xenobiotic metabolism, and production of a variety of bioactive molecules. These include vitamins, amino acids, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and metabolites, which are essential for the interconnected pathways of glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid/Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and amino acid and fatty acid metabolism. Recent studies have been elucidating how nutrients that fuel the metabolic processes impact on the ways immune cells, in particular, macrophages, respond to different stimuli under physiological and pathological conditions and become activated and acquire a specialized function. The two major inflammatory phenotypes of macrophages are controlled through differential consumption of glucose, glutamine, and oxygen. M1 phenotype is triggered by polarization signal from bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Th1 proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon-, TNF-, and IL-1, or both, whereas  phenotype is triggered by Th2 cytokines such as interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and TGF, or glucocorticoids. Glucose utilization and production of chemical mediators including ATP, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and NADPH support effector activities of M1 macrophages. Dysbiosis is an imbalance of commensal and pathogenic bacteria and the production of microbial antigens and metabolites. It is now known that the gut -derived products induce low-grade inflammatory activation of tissue-resident macrophages and contribute to metabolic and degenerative diseases, including diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. Here, we update the potential interplay of host gut  dysbiosis and metabolic diseases. We also summarize on advances on fecal therapy, probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotics, and nutrients and small molecule inhibitors of metabolic pathway enzymes as prophylactic and therapeutic agents for metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833897>Glabridin Prevents Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity Through Gut  Modulation and Colonic Macrophage Polarization in Mice.</a></h2><p>The chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) provokes a dose-related cardiotoxicity. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify the underlying mechanisms and develop strategies to overcome them. Here we demonstrated that glabridin (GLA), an isoflavone from licorice root, prevents DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through gut  modulation and colonic macrophage polarization in mice. GLA reduced DOX-induced leakage of myocardial enzymes including aminotransferase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase-MB. GLA downregulated pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, cleaved-caspase 9 and cleaved-caspase 3) and upregulated anti-apoptotic proteins (HAX-1 and Bcl-2) in the cardiac tissues. In addition, GLA modulated DOX-induced dysbiosis of gut  and thereby decreased the ratio of M1/ colonic macrophage, accompanied by the downregulated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and upregulated butyrate in the feces and peripheral blood. The leakage of myocardial enzymes induced by the DOX was decreased by antibiotics treatment, but not altered by co-treatment with the GLA and antibiotics. The ratio of M1/ colonic macrophage and leakage of myocardial enzymes reduced by the GLA were greatly increased by the  or LPS but decreased by the butyrate. Depletion of the macrophage attenuated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity but failed to further affect the effects of GLA. Importantly, GLA decreased production of M1 cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) but increased production of  cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β) in the colonic macrophage with the downregulation of NF-κB and the upregulation of STAT6. In summary, GLA prevents DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through gut  modulation and colonic macrophage polarization, and may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564717>Intestinal autophagy links psychosocial stress with gut microbiota to promote inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Psychosocial stress is a critical inducing factor of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), while autophagy is a novel central issue of IBD development. The present study investigated the potential role of autophagy in stress-related IBD in patients and animal model. The correlation between psychosocial stress and intestinal autophagy was determined in 23 patients with IBD. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a well-established inducer of psychosocial stress, was administrated in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). In IBD patients, the autophagy markers beclin-1, LC3-II/I ratio, Atg16L1, and Atg4B were significantly enhanced. The psychosocial stress score was positively associated with the levels of beclin-1 and the LC3II/I ratio in intestinal biopsy specimens. In IBD mouse model, CRH significantly aggravated intestinal inflammation, increased Paneth cell metaplasia, and enhanced intestinal autophagy (beclin-1, Atg16L1, PIK3R4, and Atg4B upregulation; GAA, CTSD, and PPKAA1 downregulation). Additionally, the CRH-induced gut microbial  was evidenced by a marked increase in the number of detrimental bacteria. In LPS-stimulated BMDM, CRH substantially increased M1/ polarization and thus promoted inflammation. In both IBD mice and LPS-treated BMDM, blockade of autophagy by chloroquine abrogated the unbeneficial effects of CRH, whereas autophagy inducer rapamycin resulted in a pronounced protective effect against IBD lesion. Our data demonstrate that psychosocial stress may link the enhanced intestinal autophagy by modulating gut microbiota and inflammation to aggravate IBD. These data indicate autophagy as a promising therapeutic target for psychosocial stress-related IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28187526>Secondary bile acid-induced dysbiosis promotes intestinal carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>The gut  plays an important role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Dysbiosis is associated with intestinal tumorigenesis. Deoxycholic acid (DCA), a secondary bile acid increased by a western diet, correlates with intestinal carcinogenesis. However, evidence relating bile acids, intestinal  and tumorigenesis are limited. In our study, we investigated the effect of DCA on induction of intestinal dysbiosis and its roles in intestinal carcinogenesis. Alteration of the composition of the intestinal  was induced in DCA-treated APC mice, which was accompanied by impaired intestinal barrier, gut low grade inflammation and tumor progression. The transfer of fecal  from DCA-treated mice to another group of Apc mice increased tumor multiplicity, induced inflammation and recruited  phenotype tumor-associated macrophages. Importantly, the fecal  transplantation activated the tumor-associated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover,  depletion by a cocktail of antibiotics was sufficient to block DCA-induced intestinal carcinogenesis, further suggesting the role of dysbiosis in tumor development. Our study demonstrated that alteration of the microbial community induced by DCA promoted intestinal carcinogenesis.© 2017 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28069576>Dysbiosis and zonulin upregulation alter gut epithelial and vascular barriers in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.</a></h2><p>Dysbiosis has been recently demonstrated in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) but its implications in the modulation of intestinal immune responses have never been studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ileal bacteria in modulating local and systemic immune responses in AS.Ileal biopsies were obtained from 50 HLA-B27 patients with AS and 20 normal subjects. Silver stain was used to visualise bacteria. Ileal expression of tight and adherens junction proteins was investigated by TaqMan real-time (RT)-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Serum levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS-binding protein (LPS-BP), intestinal fatty acid-BP (iFABP) and zonulin were assayed by ELISA. Monocyte immunological functions were studied in in vitro experiments. In addition the effects of antibiotics on tight junctions in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 transgenic (TG) rats were assessed.Adherent and invasive bacteria were observed in the gut of patients with AS with the bacterial scores significantly correlated with gut inflammation. Impairment of the gut vascular barrier (GVB) was also present in AS, accompanied by significant upregulation of zonulin, and associated with high serum levels of LPS, LPS-BP, iFABP and zonulin. In in vitro studies zonulin altered endothelial tight junctions while its epithelial release was modulated by isolated AS ileal bacteria. AS circulating monocytes displayed an anergic phenotype partially restored by ex vivo stimulation with LPS+sCD14 and their stimulation with recombinant zonulin induced a clear  phenotype. Antibiotics restored tight junction function in HLA-B27 TG rats.Bacterial ileitis, increased zonulin expression and damaged intestinal mucosal barrier and GVB, characterises the gut of patients with AS and are associated with increased blood levels of zonulin, and bacterial products. Bacterial products and zonulin influence monocyte behaviour.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Interleukin-25 (IL-25) promotes type 2 immunity via alternative activation of macrophages, and is closely associated with inflammation-related diseases, even malignancies. However, it is not clear which role IL-25 plays in the development of HCC, and whether gut microbiota are involved.IL-25 was detected by ELISA, Western blotting (WB), and immunohistochemistry. Chemokines were measured by RT-qPCR and WB. After co-culture with IL-25-stimulated macrophages, the cell growth, migration, invasion and EMT marker of HCC cell lines (MHCC97L and HepG2) were evaluated by Brdu proliferation, Transwell assays and WB. An antibody neutralization assay of chemokine CXCL10 was performed to confirm its role in HCC development. Furthermore, the effects of IL-25 in HCC were investigated in vivo.  of gut microflora was induced by antibiotics (vancomycin, cefoperazone or combination of ampicillin, neomycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin). We used feces suspension to treat colonic epithelial NCM460 cells, and detected IL-25 and tuft cell marker DCLK1 using WB and immunofluorescence staining.We found that the level of IL-25 was significantly elevated in HCC patients, and was negatively correlated with survival rate after hepatectomy. However, IL-25 did not directly promote the development of HCC cells. Then, we observed the significant positive correlation between IL-25 level and  percentage (CD206/CD68) in HCC tumors. In vitro and in vivo, IL-25 induced alternative activation of macrophages promoted HCC cell migration, invasion and tumorigenesis, increased the expression of vimentin, Snail and phospho-ERK, and decreased the expression of E-cadherin in HCC cells. After IL-25 treatment, chemokine CXCL10 was increased in macrophages. Neutralizing CXCL10 in macrophage-conditioned medium reversed the IL-25-mediated effect on HCC cells. Vancomycin-induced  promoted the growth of orthotopic HCC homograft. Surprisedly, we found the hyperplasia of colonic epithelial tuft cells, from which more IL-25 was secreted .IL-25 promotes the progression of HCC through inducing alternative activation and CXCL10 secretion of macrophages in tumor microenvironment, and IL-25 secretion may partly result from hyperplastic epithelial tuft cells in colon, induced by gut microbiota .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30951594>Effect of prebiotic and synbiotic supplementation in diet on growth performance, small intestinal morphology, stress, and bacterial population under high stocking density condition of broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>The current study investigated the effect of prebiotic mannan-oligosaccharide (MOS) and synbiotic (MOS mixed with Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis) on growth performance and bacterial population under high stocking density (HSD) conditions in broilers. A total of 605 one-day-old male Arbor Acres broiler chickens were randomly assigned to 4 treatments: normal stocking density (NSD; 30 kg/ fed basal diets), HSD (40 kg/ fed basal diets), HSD chickens fed 0.1% prebiotic (HSDp), and HSD fed 0.1% synbiotic (HSDs). At 35 D of age, the body weight of HSD and HSDp were poorer than NSD group (P < 0.01), whereas the feed conversion ratio (FCR) of the HSDs) group was better than the NSD group (P < 0.01). The HSDp and HSDs groups improved FCR (P < 0.01) and has cheaper feed cost per gain compared to the HSD group. Moreover, the body weight of HSDs group was heavier than the HSDp group (P < 0.05). The level of corticosterone and the heterophil to lymphocyte ratio were highest in the HSD group, whereas these indexes were reduced in both HSDp and HSDs groups (P < 0.05). Duodenal, jejunal, and ileal villus heights were shortest in the HSD group (P < 0.01), and the lowest ileal segment goblet cell counts were also observed in this group (P < 0.05). The HSDp and HSDs groups improved the morphology of gastrointestinal (GI) tract (P < 0.05). The Lactobacillus sp. and Clostridium sp. count in the GI tract of HSD group were low (P < 0.01), whereas Escherichia coli was high (P < 0.01), and Salmonella spp. in jejunum and cecum were detectable when compared with NSD group. Conversely, Bacillus sp., Lactobacillus sp., and Clostridium sp. in HSDp and HSDs groups were increased, and E. coli was reduced in the HSDs group (P < 0.01). Therefore, it is clear that stress from HSD negatively affected growth performance, gut morphology, and microbial population, whereas the supplementation of prebiotic or synbiotic can mitigate the effect of stress and microbial  in gut of broiler chickens under HSD condition. Comparatively, under this condition, using synbiotic appears to have more beneficial effects than using the prebiotic.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30531665>[Surgical treatment of obesity from the nutritional point - opportunities and dangers].</a></h2><p>Obesity is a civilization disease, which occurrence in the world population is gradually increasing. The basic causes of obesity include a sedentary lifestyle and energy-rich diet contributing to a positive energy balance. Methods of curing obesity contain the lifestyle modification, the pharmacological treatment and the surgical treatment. The bariatric surgery is a therapy that can be used among patients with BMI ≥40 or BMI ≥35 kg/ with comorbidities, e.g. hypertension, for whom previous treatment has been ineffective. The surgical treatment includes restrictive, limiting absorption and hybrid methods among them the most frequently performed sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Surgical treatment affects the clinical course of many chronic diseases, e.g. diabetes mellitus type 2. Unfortunately, this method of treatment is related to complications and is associated with increased risk of many complications, nutritional deficiencies, as well as deterioration of mental health. The potential causes of psychiatric disorders following bariatric surgery include dysbiosis and brain - gut axis dysfunction. After surgery, a dysbiosis is noticed (a reduction of Bifidobacterium spp.) that may increase the risk of depressive disorders occurrence. For this reason, to effective obesity treatment, patients undergoing bariatric surgery should be covered by the longterm care of an interdisciplinary team.© 2018 MEDPRESS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28871257>Reactivation of Intestinal Inflammation Is Suppressed by Catestatin in a Murine Model of Colitis  M1 Macrophages and Not the Gut .</a></h2><p>While there is growing awareness of a relationship between chromogranin-A (CHGA) and susceptibility to inflammatory conditions, the role of human catestatin [(hCTS); CHGA] in the natural history of established inflammatory bowel disease is not known. Recently, using two different experimental models, we demonstrated that hCTS-treated mice develop less severe acute colitis. We have also shown the implication of the macrophages in this effect. The aims of this study were to determine (1) whether hCTS treatment could attenuate the reactivation of inflammation in adult mice with previously established chronic colitis; (2) whether this effect is mediated through macrophages or the gut . Quiescent colitis was induced in 7-8-week-old C57BL6 mice using four cycles (2-4%) of dextran sulfate sodium. hCTS (1.5 mg/kg/day) treatment or vehicle started 2 days before the last induction of colitis and continuing for 7 days. At sacrifice, macro- and microscopic scores were determined. Colonic pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and TNF- α], anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF- β), classically activated (M1) (), and alternatively activated () () macrophages markers were studied using ELISA and/or RT-qPCR. , peritoneal macrophages isolated from naïve mice and treated with hCTS (10 M, 12 h) were exposed to either lipopolysaccharide (100 ng/ml, 12 h) to polarize M1 macrophages or to IL-4/IL-13 (20 ng/ml) to polarize  macrophages. M1/ macrophage markers along with cytokine gene expression were determined using RT-qPCR. Feces and mucosa-associated  (MAM) samples were collected, and the V4 region of 16 s rRNA was sequenced. Micro- and macroscopic scores, colonic IL-6, IL-1β, TNF- α, and M1 macrophages markers were significantly decreased in the hCTS-treated group. Treatment did not have any effect on colonic IL-10, TGF-β, and  markers nor modified the bacterial richness, diversity, or the major phyla in colitic fecal and MAM samples. , pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, as well as their gene expression, were significantly reduced in hCTS-treated M1 macrophages. hCTS treatment did not affect  macrophage markers. These findings suggest that hCTS treatment attenuates the severity of inflammatory relapse through the modulation of the M1 macrophages and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p></html>
