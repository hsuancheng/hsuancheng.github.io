However, little is known about its direct impact on the liver.To investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of AITC in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (commonly referred to as NAFLD).To establish a mouse and cellular model of NAFLD, C57BL/6 mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 8 wk, and AML-12 cells were treated with 200 μM palmitate acid for 24 h. For AITC treatment, mice were administered AITC (100 mg/kg/d) orally and AML-12 cells were treated with AITC (20 μmol/L).AITC significantly ameliorated HFD-induced weight gain, hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation . Furthermore, serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were markedly reduced in AITC-treated mice. Mechanistically, AITC significantly downregulated the protein levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and its  target genes and upregulated the levels of proteins involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, as well as the upstream mediators Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα), in the livers of HFD-fed mice. AITC also attenuated the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Consistently, AITC relieved palmitate acid-induced lipid accumulation and inflammation in AML-12 cells  through the Sirt1/AMPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. Importantly, further studies showed that the curative effect of AITC on lipid accumulation was abolished by siRNA-mediated knockdown of either Sirt1 or AMPKα in AML-12 cells.AITC significantly ameliorates hepatic steatosis and inflammation by activating the Sirt1/AMPK pathway and inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. Therefore, AITC is a potential therapeutic agent for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683987>Inhibition of GSK3β Reduces Ectopic Lipid Accumulation and Induces Autophagy by the AMPK Pathway in Goat Muscle Satellite Cells.</a></h2><p>Ectopic lipid accumulation in muscle is important not only for obesity and myopathy treatment, but also for meat quality improvement in farm animals. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in lipid metabolism in muscle satellite cells are still elusive. In this study, SB216763 reduced GSK3β activation by increasing the level of pGSK3β (Ser9) and decreasing the level of total GSK3β protein. GSK3β inhibition decreased lipid accumulation and downregulated the expression level of -related genes in the adipogenic differentiation of goat muscle satellite cells. Furthermore, SB216763 treatment increased the levels of pAMPKα (T172) and pACC (Ser79). Further, we found that GSK3β inhibition promoted levels of LC3B-II and reduced the protein levels of p62 to induce the autophagy in muscle satellite cells. Taken together, our results provide new insight into a critical function for GSK3β: modulating lipid accumulation in goat muscle satellite cells through activating the AMPK pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576746>Dose-Dependent Effects of Triclocarban Exposure on Lipid Homeostasis in Rats.</a></h2><p>Environmental exposure to triclocarban (TCC), a common antibacterial agent widely used in thousands of personal care products, poses a potential risk for human health. Previous in vitro studies about biological effects of TCC have yielded a variety of inconsistent results and apparently not been verified in vivo. In the current study, dose-dependent effects of TCC exposure on lipid homeostasis in rats were investigated using a combination of untargeted H NMR metabolomics, targeted metabolite profiling (LC/GC-MS), histopathological assessments, and biological assays. Our results revealed that TCC dose-dependently activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and its transcriptional targets such as  and  in the liver of rats, suggesting that TCC may be a potent AHR agonist. Although TCC exhibited dose-dependent toxicity, oral exposure with relatively low dose TCC caused more significant hepatic  of rats than relatively high and moderate doses of TCC. It was mainly manifested by histopathological observations and promotion of de novo fatty acid, phospholipid, and ceramide biosynthesis and gut microbiota fermentation. Our findings provide new insights into health effects of TCC exposure with different dosages in vivo, especially on the induction and progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and further our understanding in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases induced by environmental pollutants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646946> effect on Yan Yellow Cattle preadipocyte differentiation.</a></h2><p>Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 () is a cytosolic enzyme that mainly catalyzes the oxidation of acetaldehyde into acetic acid and participates in the regulation of differentiation and gene expression in fat cell growth and development. However, the physiological role of  in the formation of fat cell precursors in the Yan Yellow Cattle is still not clear. Herein, we investigated the specific regulation of the gene encoding for  during the differentiation process of the adipocyte cells of the Yan Yellow Cattle by interfering or overexpressing the  gene. As a result, we found that the mRNA expression levels of  were significantly increased during the formation of progenitor cells. In addition, the expression levels of the Lipoprotein lipase ) and transcription factors (, ) were also significantly increased.  gene overexpression and RNA interfering promoted and inhibited respectively the lipid accumulation and triglyceride production in mature adipocytes, and the expression of the LPL and transcription factors (, ). The changes in the protein expression levels of  and adipogenic factors were in accord with the changes observed in the mRNA levels. In conclusion, our results indicate that  plays an important regulatory role in the differentiation of preadipocyte cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580832>Clinical implications of ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 mRNA expression in melanoma subtypes.</a></h2><p>Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity is not only a valuable marker for cancer cells with stem-like features, but also plays a vital role in drug resistance and disease progression in many tumors including melanoma. However, the precise role of ALDH activity in patient prognosis remains unclear. In this study, using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-sequencing expression data, we analyzed gene expression of ALDH isozymes in melanoma tumors to define the expression patterns and the prognostic and predictive values of these enzymes. We found that ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 had both higher and broader expression ranges in melanoma patients, and that ALDH1A3 expression correlated with better overall survival in metastatic melanoma. Further, stratification of the TCGA cohorts by the mutational subtypes of melanoma specifically revealed that expression of ALDH1A3 correlated with better prognosis in metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma while expression of ALDH1A1 correlated with better prognosis in BRAF wild-type melanoma. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of these cohorts identified upregulation in oxidative phosphorylation, , and fatty acid metabolism signaling in ALDH1A patients, suggesting BRAF/MEK inhibitor resistance in that subset of patients. On the other hand, GSEA of ALDH1A3 cohorts revealed upregulation in glycolysis, hypoxia and angiogenesis, suggesting BRAF/MEK inhibitor sensitivity in that subset of patients. Gene expression analysis using pre-treatment tumor samples supports high ALDH1A3 expression before BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment as predictive of better treatment response in BRAF-mutant melanoma patients. Our study provides evidence that high ALDH1A3 mRNA expression is not only a prognostic marker but also a predictive marker for BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment response in BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma patients.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661889>Combined Exposure to Fructose and Bisphenol A Exacerbates Abnormal Lipid Metabolism in Liver of Developmental Male Rats.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether combined exposure to fructose and bisphenol A (BPA) has a synergistic effect on abnormal lipid metabolism in the liver of developmental male rats and its possible mechanism. Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating lipid metabolism include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), zinc α 2 glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, insulin, IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured. Liver tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing  were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hepatic fat accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in liver, and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group. Therefore, abnormal lipid metabolism in the liver of developmental rats could be exacerbated by combined exposed to fructose and BPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31525727>GLUCAGON MODULATES PROLIFERATION AND DIFFERENTIATION OF HUMAN ADIPOSE PRECURSORS.</a></h2><p>Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), which are currently used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, have recently been proposed as anti-obesity drugs, due to their relevant effects on weight loss. Furthermore, dual agonists for both GLP-1R and glucagon receptor (GCGR) are under investigation for their promising action on adiposity, although underlying mechanisms still need to be clarified. We have recently demonstrated that GLP-1 and liraglutide interfere with the proliferation and differentiation of human adipose precursors, supporting the hypothesis of a peripheral action of GLP-1RA on weight. Here, we investigated glucagon activity in an in vitro model of primary human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). Glucagon significantly inhibited ASC proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as evaluated by cell count and thymidine incorporation. When added during in vitro-induced , glucagon significantly reduced adipocyte differentiation, as demonstrated by the evaluation of intracellular fat content and quantitative expression of early and mature adipocyte markers (PPARγ and FABP4, HSL). Notably, the inhibitory effect of glucagon on cell proliferation and  was reversed by specific GLP-1R (exendin-9) and GCGR [des-His1-Glu9-glucagon(1-29)] antagonists. The presence of both receptors was demonstrated by Western blot, immunofluorescence and cytofluorimetric analysis of ASCs. In conclusion, we demonstrated a direct inhibitory action of glucagon on the proliferation and differentiation of human adipose precursors, which seems to involve both GLP-1R and GCGR. These findings suggest that the adipose stem compartment is a novel target of glucagon, possibly contributing to the weight loss obtained in vivo with dual GLP-1R/glucagon agonists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573549>Contribution of  to healthy adipose tissue expansion in obesity.</a></h2><p>The manner in which white adipose tissue (WAT) expands and remodels directly impacts the risk of developing metabolic syndrome in obesity. Preferential accumulation of visceral WAT is associated with increased risk for insulin resistance, whereas subcutaneous WAT expansion is protective. Moreover, pathologic WAT remodeling, typically characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy, chronic inflammation, and fibrosis, is associated with insulin resistance. Healthy WAT expansion, observed in the "metabolically healthy" obese, is generally associated with the presence of smaller and more numerous adipocytes, along with lower degrees of inflammation and fibrosis. Here, we highlight recent human and rodent studies that support the notion that the ability to recruit new fat cells through  is a critical determinant of healthy adipose tissue distribution and remodeling in obesity. Furthermore, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the identity of tissue-resident progenitor populations in WAT made possible through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. A better understanding of adipose stem cell biology and  may lead to novel strategies to uncouple obesity from metabolic disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691574>Nrf2 mediates oxidative stress-induced lipid accumulation in adipocytes by increasing  and decreasing lipolysis.</a></h2><p>Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a regulator of cellular oxidative stress and is also involved in lipid metabolism in adipocytes. However, it remains unknown whether Nrf2 is the link between oxidative stress and the induction of lipid accumulation in adipocytes.Here, we show that oxidative stress is markedly increased in white adipose tissue from mice with high-fat diet-induced or genetically (ob/ob)-induced obesity and from human subjects with obesity. Notably, in response to oxidative stress, Nrf2 expression and activity were induced, further promoting lipid accumulation in adipocytes and exacerbating the development of obesity. In contrast, Nrf2 ablation alleviated oxidative stress-induced lipid accumulation. Mechanistically, oxidative stress promoted Nrf2 recruitment to the SREBP-1 promoter, inducing target gene transcription and subsequent . Additionally, Nrf2 mediated oxidative stress-inhibited lipolysis in adipocytes via the PKA pathway. Innovation and Conclusion: Our data provide a novel insight that Nrf2, as a critical signaling node, links oxidative stress to the induction of fat accumulation in adipocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616396>SCFAs-Induced GLP-1 Secretion Links the Regulation of Gut Microbiome on Hepatic  in Chickens.</a></h2><p>The impact of gut microbiota and its metabolites on fat metabolism have been widely reported in human and animals. However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in lipid metabolism that liver is the main site of lipid synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut microbiota and fat synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined probiotics (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal microbiota diversity, altered short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed . In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. GLP-1 suppressed lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut microbiota on hepatic  in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31577934>Dietary Sugars Alter Hepatic Fatty Acid Oxidation via Transcriptional and Post-translational Modifications of Mitochondrial Proteins.</a></h2><p>Dietary sugars, fructose and glucose, promote hepatic de novo  and modify the effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) on the development of insulin resistance. Here, we show that fructose and glucose supplementation of an HFD exert divergent effects on hepatic mitochondrial function and fatty acid oxidation. This is mediated via three different nodes of regulation, including differential effects on malonyl-CoA levels, effects on mitochondrial size/protein abundance, and acetylation of mitochondrial proteins. HFD- and HFD plus fructose-fed mice have decreased CTP1a activity, the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid oxidation, whereas knockdown of fructose metabolism increases CPT1a and its acylcarnitine products. Furthermore, fructose-supplemented HFD leads to increased acetylation of ACADL and CPT1a, which is associated with decreased fat metabolism. In summary, dietary fructose, but not glucose, supplementation of HFD impairs mitochondrial size, function, and protein acetylation, resulting in decreased fatty acid oxidation and development of metabolic dysregulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A well-established linear relationship exists between hypertension and obesity. The combined burden of hypertension and obesity poses significant health and economic challenges. Many environmental factors and genetic traits interact to contribute to obesity-linked hypertension. These include excess sodium re-absorption or secretion by the kidneys, a hypertensive shift of renal-pressure and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Most individuals suffering from hypertension need drugs in order to treat their raised blood pressure, and while a number of antihypertensive therapeutic agents are currently available, 50% of cases remain uncontrolled. In order to develop new and effective therapeutic agents combating obesity-induced hypertension, a thorough understanding of the molecular events leading to  is critical. With the advent of whole genome and exome sequencing techniques, new genes and variants which can be used as markers for obesity and hypertension are being identified. This review examines the role played by alternative splicing (AS) as a contributing factor to the metabolic regulation of obesity-induced hypertension. Splicing mutations constitute at least 14% of the disease-causing mutations, thus implicating polymorphisms that effect splicing as indicators of disease susceptibility. The unique transcripts resulting from the alternate splicing of mRNA encoding proteins that play a key role in contributing to obesity would be vital to gain a proper understanding of the genetic causes of obesity. A greater knowledge of the genetic basis for obesity-linked hypertension will assist in the development of appropriate diagnostic tests as well as the identification of new personalized therapeutic targets against obesity-induced hypertension.© 2019 Dlamini et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672599>Heptamethoxyflavone inhibits  via enhancing PKA signaling.</a></h2><p>3,5,6,7,8,3',4'-heptamethoxyflavone (HMF), a naturally occurring polymethoxyflavone found in citrus peel, is known to have neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. However, the effects of HMF on  remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that HMF inhibits the early stage of  and maturation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. HMF treatment during preadipocyte differentiation for 8 days reduced lipid accumulation in a dose-dependent manner, and the expression levels of key adipogenic transcription factors (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα)) and the lipogenic transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP1), were lower after the initial 4 days of the differentiation. Moreover, PPARγ expression level was lower even after the initial 2 days, but C/EBPα and SREBP1 expression was not. HMF upregulated the phosphorylation of protein kinase A catalytic subunit α (PKACα), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in 3T3-L1 cells. The phosphorylation of ACC leads to the inhibition of . Furthermore, the induction of phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC by HMF was abolished by RNA interference targeting PKACα.

Here, we show that HSF1, a physiological substrate for AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), constitutively suppresses this central metabolic sensor. By physically evoking conformational switching of AMPK, HSF1 impairs AMP binding to the γ subunits and enhances the PP2A-mediated de-phosphorylation, but it impedes the LKB1-mediated phosphorylation of Thr172, and retards ATP binding to the catalytic α subunits. These immediate and manifold regulations empower HSF1 to both repress AMPK under basal conditions and restrain its activation by diverse stimuli, thereby promoting , cholesterol synthesis, and protein cholesteroylation. In vivo, HSF1 antagonizes AMPK to control body fat mass and drive the lipogenic phenotype and growth of melanomas independently of its intrinsic transcriptional action. Thus, the physical AMPK-HSF1 interaction epitomizes a reciprocal kinase-substrate regulation whereby lipid metabolism and proteomic stability intertwine.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31539873>eEF1A2 exacerbated insulin resistance in male skeletal muscle via PKCβ and ER stress.</a></h2><p>Recent studies raise the possibility that eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) may play a role in metabolism. One isoform, eEF1A2, is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle, heart and brain. It regulates translation elongation and signal transduction. Nonetheless, eEF1A2's function in skeletal muscle glucose metabolism remains unclear. In the present study, suppression subtractive hybridisation showed a decrease in Eef1a2 transcripts in the skeletal muscle of diabetic Mongolian gerbils. This was confirmed at mRNA and protein levels in hyperglycaemic gerbils, and in db/db and high-fat diet-fed mice. Further, this downregulation was independent of Eef1a2 promoter methylation. Interestingly, adeno-associated virus-mediated eEF1A2 overexpression in skeletal muscle aggravated fasting hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and glucose intolerance in male diabetic gerbils but not in female gerbil models. The overexpression of eEF1A2 in skeletal muscle also resulted in promoted serum glucose levels and insulin resistance in male db/db mice. Up- and downregulation of eEF1A2 by lentiviral vector transfection confirmed its inhibitory effect on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and signalling transduction in C2C12 myotubes with palmitate (PA)-induced insulin resistance. Furthermore, eEF1A2 bound PKCβ and increased its activation in the cytoplasm, whereas suppression of PKCβ by an inhibitor attenuated eEF1A2-mediated impairment of insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant myotubes. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was elevated by eEF1A2, whereas suppression of ER stress or JNK partially restored insulin sensitivity in PA-treated myotubes. Additionally, eEF1A2 inhibited  and lipid utilisation in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle. Collectively, we demonstrated that eEF1A2 exacerbates insulin resistance in male murine skeletal muscle via PKCβ and ER stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632961>NFκB/Orai1 Facilitates Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress by Oxidative Stress in the Pathogenesis of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) promote  , which caused abnormal hepatic lipid accumulation, by the NFκB-Orai1 pathway. Oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been recognized as key mechanisms in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis. Whether Orai1 facilitates ER stress by oxidative stress remains unknown. The rat model of NAFLD was constructed by feeding high-fat diet (HFD). BRL-3A cells were treated with NEFAs, Orai1inhibtor BTP2, NFκB inhibitor wogonin, or small interfering Orai (siOrai) 1, respectively. The content of intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating oxidative stress, was measured by a spectrophotometer. ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, CHOP, and GRP78 were quantified using Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses. For the intracellular location of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Orai1 were measured by Western blot and immunofluorescence, and cytosolic Ca was measured by flow cytometry. As we expected, the liver of rats with NAFLD showed lipid droplets in HE and Oil Red O. The decreased GSH and increased MDA were found in rats fed with HFD. ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, GRP78, and CHOP were significantly increased in the HFD group. In BRL-3A cells, GSH content dramatically decreased from 1 h, MDA content dramatically increased from 3 h, and expression levels of ER stress significantly increased from 3 h by NEFA treatment. Furthermore, cytosolic Ca increased from 0.5 h by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. It indicated that NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca to induce oxidative stress, thus ER stress. The content of oxidative stress and ER stress proteins showed the same trends by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. These effects were reversed by the Orai1 inhibitor BTP2 and the NFκB inhibitor wogonin. Moreover, siOrai1 abrogated NEFAs' influence in BRL-3A cells. Last, ROS was found by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells, and NEFA treatment enhanced the nuclear localization of NF-κB p65 and ORAI1. It was considered that high NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca and enhanced NFκB-dependent SOCE and its moiety protein Orai1 to decrease GSH and thus induced oxidative stress at earlier stages and furthermore tempted ER stress in the pathologic progress of NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Li, Zou, Guo, Zhang, Xia, Zhang, Yang and Xu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513095>Increased Fibrogenic Gene Expression in Multifidus Muscles of Patients with Chronic Versus Acute Lumbar Spine Pathology.</a></h2><p>Prospective Observational Study- Basic Science (Level 1).To compare expression of functional groups of genes within the atrophic, myogenic, fibrogenic, adipogenic, and inflammatory pathways between paraspinal muscle biopsies from individuals with acute and chronic lumbar spine pathology.Low back pain is a complex and multifactorial condition that affects a majority of the general population annually. Changes in muscle tissue composition (i.e. fatty and fibrotic infiltration) are a common feature in individuals with lumbar spine pathology associated with low back pain, which often result in functional loss. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of these degenerative changes in different phases of disease progression may improve disease prevention and treatment specificity.Intraoperative biopsies of the multifidus muscle were obtained from individuals undergoing surgery for acute (<6-month duration) or chronic (>6-month duration) lumbar spine pathology. Expression of 42 genes related to myogenesis, atrophy, , metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis were measured in 33 samples (8 acute, 25 chronic) using qPCR, and tissue composition of fat, muscle, and fibrosis was quantified using histology.We found that tissue composition of the biopsies was heterogeneous, resulting in a trend toward lower RNA yields in biopsies with higher proportions of fat (r <-0.39, p < 0.1). There were no significant differences in gene expression patterns for atrophy (p > 0.635),  (p > 0.317), myogenesis (p > 0.320), or inflammatory (p > 0.413) genes after adjusting for the proportion of muscle, fat, and connective tissue.

Here we predicted and validated a novel feed-forward loop regulating  and involved miR-27a/b-3p, PPARG and Secretory Carrier Membrane Protein 3 (SCAMP3). In this loop, expression of both PPARG and SCAMP3 was independently suppressed by miR-27a/b-3p overexpression. Knockdown of PPARG downregulated SCAMP3 expression at the late phase of , whereas reduction of SCAMP3 mRNA levels increased PPARG expression at early phase in differentiation. The latter was accompanied with upregulation of adipocyte-enriched genes, including ADIPOQ and FABP4, suggesting an anti-adipogenic role for SCAMP3. PPARG and SCAMP3 exhibited opposite behaviors regarding correlations with clinical phenotypes, including body mass index, body fat mass, adipocyte size, lipolytic and lipogenic capacity, and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. While adipose PPARG expression was associated with more favorable metabolic phenotypes, SCAMP3 expression was linked to increased fat mass and insulin resistance.

However, the relationship between SIRT3 and aberrant lipid synthesis in cervical cancer remains unclear. Here, we investigated the clinical relevance of SIRT3 expression in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and normal tissues. To analyze the role of SIRT3 in CCSC in vitro, endogenous SIRT3 levels were up- and down-regulated in SiHa and C33a cells, respectively, via lentiviral-based transfection. Levels were quantified using qRT-PCR. Acetylation levels for acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACC1) were measured with the anti-acetyllysine antibody. Knockdown of SIRT3 reduced levels of cellular lipid content in cells. To investigate the role of SIRT3 in cell proliferation, nude mice were xenografted with SIRT3-overexpressing or SIRT3-knockdown CCSC cells. Overall, the results demonstrate that SIRT3 significantly contributed to the reprogramming of FA synthesis in CCSC by up-regulating ACC1 to promote de novo  by SIRT3 deacetylation.

Apolipoprotein A5 (ApoA5) has been shown to influence the prevalence and pathology of obesity. However, the underlying mechanisms remains to be unclarified.Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) were treated with 600 ng/ml ApoA5. The effect of ApoA5 on affecting intracellular TG content and adipogenic related factors expression were determined. Furthermore, the effect of ApoA5 on CIDE-C expression was also determined.During the AMSCs , ApoA5 could reduce the intracellular lipid droplets accumulation and the TG level; meanwhile, ApoA5 down-regulated the expression level of adipogenic related factors, including CCAAT enhancer binding proteins α/β (C/EBPα/β), fatty acid synthetase (FAS) and fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4). Furthermore, the suppression of  by ApoA5 was mediated through the inhibition of CIDE-C expression, an important factor which could promote the process of human AMSCs . However, over-expressing intracellular expression of CIDE-C could lead to the loss-of-function of ApoA5 in inhibiting AMSCs .In conclusion, ApoA5 could inhibit human AMSCs  through, at least partly, down-regulating CIDE-C expression.

Treatment of 3T3-L1 mouse adipocyte during differentiation adipocytes with (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and gallic acid (GA) resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of . Specifically, EGC increased adiponectin and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) transcription in mature adipocytes. Transcription levels of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) were not significantly impacted by either of the compounds. These results suggest that the EGC is the most effective catechin having anti-obesity activity. Finally, EGC is an attractive candidate component for remodeling obesity.© 2019 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546122>Promoting differentiation and lipid metabolism are the primary effects for DINP exposure on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.</a></h2><p>Diisononyl phthalate (DINP) is a high-molecular-weight phthalate, and has been recently introduced as di-(2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate (DEHP) substitute and commonly used in a large variety of plastic items. The fat tissue is an important target for DINP exposure, however, very little is understood about its toxicity and mechanism(s) in adipocyte cells. Therefore, the present work aimed to investigate the role of DINP in  using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. DINP exposure for 10 days extensively induced  in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes as assessed by lipid accumulation and gene expression of adipogenic markers. The RT-qPCR results showed that DINP could upregulate the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα) and C/EBPβ, while the expression of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1) and C/EBPδ was not affected. The DINP-induced  could be inhibited by using the selective PPARγ antagonist GW9662. The RNA-seq analysis was used to study the systemic toxicities of DINP on preadipocytes. A total of 1181 differently expressed genes (DEGs) (640 genes were up-regulated, 541 genes were down-regulated) were detected in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes under 50 μM DINP. The GO enrichment showed the GO term of "fat cell differentiation" was the most significantly affected metabolic functions, and the KEGG pathway enrichment showed the PPAR pathway was the top affected pathway. The interactive pathway (iPath) analysis showed that the changed metabolic pathways were focus on the lipid metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) is a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family composed of structurally related cell surface receptors and acts, in consort with Frizzled receptors, as a coreceptor to mediate the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. Impaired LRP6 signalling in humans has been associated with multiple cardiovascular risk factors such as elevated serum LDL, triglycerides, and glucose levels. Considerable efforts have been deployed to better understand the underlying mechanisms of LRP6-associated disorders, and the therapeutic targeting of LRP6 has been demonstrated to have positive effects in various animal models of cardiovascular disease. This review presents a synthetic summary highlighting the major roles of LRP6. LRP6 regulates a multitude of cellular mechanisms dependently or independently of the β-catenin pathway, as LRP6 activates gene transcription, regulates crucial cellular events such as cell cycle or protein synthesis, and even modulates gap junctional coupling in cardiomyocytes and LDLR recycling in hepatocytes. We discuss the potential contribution of LRP6 as a therapeutic target, as LRP6 inhibition limits myocardial fibrosis and promotes cardiac repair in myocardial infarction, limits neointimal formation in carotid injury models, decreases blood pressure in hypertensive animals, and reduces  and  to prevent hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. These findings from past studies highlight LRP6 as a key player in the development of heart disease and a promising therapeutic target for cardiovascular disease in humans.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

Recent studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in the regulation of self-renewal, proliferation, and multi-directional differentiation of ASCs. In the present study, we analyzed the targeting miRNAs on C/EBPα and found that miR-326 played an essential role in it. The results of qPCR confirmed that the expression of miR-326 was reduced in adipogenic differentiation. In addition, the dual-luciferase reporter assay system verified binding between miR-326 and the 3' untranslated region of C/EBPα. Furthermore, transfection of miR-326 into human adipose-derived stem cells caused a significant reduction in C/EBPα. Our results highlight the importance of miR-326 in adipogenic differentiation and provide a reliable basis for clinical treatment of adipose-related diseases.

CYP24A1 is the key enzyme for metabolic inactivation of active VD (1,25(OH)D). We examined whether common germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CYP24A1 gene could affect the association between adult weight gain and breast cancer (BC) risk.The population-based case-control study included 818 patients with primary BC and 935 residence and age matched healthy controls. We studied the relationships between CYP24A1 gene SNPs (rs2209314, rs2585428, rs2762941, rs3787555, rs4809959, rs73913757, rs912505, and rs927a650), adult weight change and BC risk. Gene-weight change interactions were analyzed.Neither of CYP24A1 gene SNPs was associated with BC risk in the study participants. However, we found consistent gene-weight interactions with increasing adult weight gain for CYP24A1-rs2762941 (P-interaction = 0.0089) and CYP24A1-rs927650 (P-interaction = 0.0283). Adult weight gain has a higher premenopausal BC risk with double variant T alleles of rs927650 compared to women carrying at least one wild-type C allele (OR for TT = 1.82, 95% CI 1.10-3.01; for CT = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76-1.14; for CC = 1.12 95% CI 0.93-1.35). Women with double wild-type A alleles were at a higher postmenopausal BC risk compared to those carrying at least one variant-type G allele (OR for AA = 1.51, 95% CI 1.29-1.76; for AG = 1.13, 95% CI 0.98-1.30; for GG = 1.22 95% CI 0.95-1.57). When stratified by CYP24A1 SNPs genotypes, weight gain in adulthood increased postmenopausal BC risk of women with homozygous allele compared to women with heterozygotes allele.Significant interactions of weight change with CYP24A1 polymorphisms suggest CYP24A1 as a potential link between weight change and BC risk and the possibility that the impact of adult weight gain on postmenopausal BC risk may be enhanced by homozygous alleles of CYP24A1 SNPs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678070>Downregulation of PHGDH expression and hepatic serine level contribute to the development of fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Supplementation with serine attenuates alcoholic fatty liver by regulating homocysteine metabolism and . However, little is known about serine metabolism in fatty liver disease (FLD). We aimed to investigate the changes in serine biosynthetic pathways in humans and animal models of fatty liver and their contribution to the development of FLD.High-fat diet (HFD)-induced steatosis and methionine-choline-deficient diet-induced steatohepatitis animal models were employed. Human serum samples were obtained from patients with FLD whose proton density fat fraction was estimated by magnetic resonance imaging. 3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh)-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and transgenic mice overexpressing Phgdh (Tg-phgdh) were used to evaluate the role of serine metabolism in the development of FLD.Expression of Phgdh was markedly reduced in the animal models. There were significant negative correlations of the serum serine with the liver fat fraction, serum alanine transaminase, and triglyceride levels among patients with FLD. Increased lipid accumulation and reduced NAD and SIRT1 activity were observed in Phgdh-knockout MEF and primary hepatocytes incubated with free fatty acids; these effects were reversed by overexpression of Phgdh. Tg-Phgdh mice showed significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation compared with wild-type littermates fed a HFD, which was accompanied by increased SIRT1 activity and reduced expression of lipogenic genes and proteins.Human and experimental data suggest that reduced Phgdh expression and serine levels are closely associated with the development of FLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Studies on SCD1 deficiency in mouse models demonstrated beneficial metabolic phenotypes such as reduced adiposity and improved glucose tolerance. Even though, SCD1 represents a potential target to resolve obesity related metabolic diseases; SCD1 deficiency causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activates unfolded protein response (UPR). The induction of ER stress in response to SCD1 deficiency is governed by the cofactor, PGC-1α. However, the mechanism by which SCD1 deficiency increases PGC-1α and subsequently induces ER stress still remains elusive. The present study demonstrates that despite reduced , liver specific SCD1 deficiency activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) along with induction of PGC-1α and ER stress. Further, mTORC1 inhibition attenuates SCD1 deficiency-mediated induction of both PGC-1α and ER stress. Similar observations were seen by restoring endogenously synthesized oleate, but not palmitoleate, suggesting a clear mTORC1-mediated regulation of ER stress during SCD1 deficiency. Overall, our results suggest a model whereby maintaining adequate levels of hepatic oleate is required to suppress mTORC1-mediated ER stress. In addition, the activation of mTORC1 by SCD1 deficiency reveals an important function of fatty acids in regulating different cellular processes through mTORC1 signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628041>MIGA2 Links Mitochondria, the ER, and Lipid Droplets and Promotes De Novo  in Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Physical contact between organelles is vital to the function of eukaryotic cells. Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic organelles specialized in lipid storage that interact physically with mitochondria in several cell types. The mechanisms coupling these organelles are, however, poorly understood, and the cell-biological function of their interaction remains largely unknown. Here, we discover in adipocytes that the outer mitochondrial membrane protein MIGA2 links mitochondria to LDs. We identify an amphipathic LD-targeting motif and reveal that MIGA2 binds to the membrane proteins VAP-A or VAP-B in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We find that in adipocytes MIGA2 is involved in promoting triglyceride (TAG) synthesis from non-lipid precursors. Our data indicate that MIGA2 links reactions of de novo  in mitochondria to TAG production in the ER, thereby facilitating efficient lipid storage in LDs. Based on its presence in many tissues, MIGA2 is likely critical for lipid and energy homeostasis in a wide spectrum of cell types.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The inflammation-dependent increase in  requires induction of the liver X receptors, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, by type I interferons in response to inflammatory signals. Instead of the well-established role for liver X receptors in stimulating cholesterol efflux, we demonstrate that liver X receptors are necessary for the proper resumption of cholesterol synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Thus, liver X receptors function as bidirectional regulators of cholesterol homeostasis driving efflux when cholesterol levels are high and facilitating synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Liver X receptor activity is also required for the proper shutdown of a subset of type I interferon-stimulated genes as inflammation subsides, placing the receptors in a negative feedback loop that may contribute to resolution of the inflammatory response.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551089>Disease-treatment interactions in the management of patients with obesity and diabetes who have atrial fibrillation: the potential mediating influence of epicardial adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Both obesity and type 2 diabetes are important risk factors for atrial fibrillation (AF), possibly because they both cause an expansion of epicardial adipose tissue, which is the source of proinflammatory adipocytokines that can lead to microvascular dysfunction and fibrosis of the underlying myocardium. If the derangement of epicardial fat adjoins the left atrium, the result is an atrial myopathy, which is clinically manifest as AF. In patients with AF, there is a close relationship between epicardial fat volume and the severity of electrophysiological abnormalities in the adjacent myocardial tissues, and epicardial fat mass predicts AF in the general population. The expansion of epicardial adipose tissue in obesity and type 2 diabetes may also affect the left ventricle, impairing its distensibility and leading to heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Patients with obesity or type 2 diabetes with AF often have HFpEF, but the diagnosis may be missed, if dyspnea is attributed to increased body mass or to the arrhythmia. The expected response to the treatment for obesity, diabetes or AF may be influenced by their effects on epicardial inflammation and the underlying atrial and ventricular myopathy. Bariatric surgery and metformin reduce epicardial fat mass and ameliorate AF, whereas insulin promotes  and cardiac fibrosis, and its use is accompanied by an increased risk of AF. Rate control strategies for AF may impair exercise tolerance, because they allow for greater time for ventricular filling in patients who cannot tolerate volume loading because of cardiac fibrosis and HFpEF. At the same time, both obesity and diabetes decrease the expected success rate of rhythm control strategies for AF (e.g., electrical cardioversion or catheter ablation), because increased epicardial adipose tissue volumes and cardiac fibrosis are important determinants of AF recurrence following these procedures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615896>The transcription factor NKX1-2 promotes  and may contribute to a balance between adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation.</a></h2><p>Although  is mainly controlled by a small number of master transcription factors including CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family members and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), other transcription factors also are involved in this process. Thyroid cancer cells expressing a paired box 8 (PAX8)-PPARγ fusion oncogene trans-differentiate into adipocyte-like cells in the presence of the PPARγ ligand pioglitazone, but this trans-differentiation is inhibited by the transcription factor NK2 homeobox 1 (NKX2-1). Here, we tested whether NKX family members may play a role also in normal . Using quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR), we examined the expression of all 14 NKX family members during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. We found that most NKX members, including NKX2-1, are expressed at very low levels throughout differentiation. However, mRNA and protein expression of a related family member, NKX1-2, was induced during adipocyte differentiation. NKX1-2 also was up-regulated in cultured murine ear mesenchymal stem cells (EMSCs) during . Importantly, shRNA-mediated NKX1-2 knockdown in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or EMSCs almost completely blocked adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, NKX1-2 overexpression promoted differentiation of the ST2 bone marrow-derived mesenchymal precursor cell line into adipocytes. Additional findings suggested that NKX1-2 promotes  by inhibiting expression of the antiadipogenic protein COUP transcription factor II. Bone marrow mesenchymal precursor cells can differentiate into adipocytes or osteoblasts, and we found that NKX1- 2 both promotes ST2 cell  and inhibits their osteoblastogenic differentiation. These results support a role for NKX1-2 in promoting  and possibly in regulating the balance between adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal precursor cells.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695927>Mechanisms of action of coffee bioactive components on lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Coffee consumption is associated with reduced risk of metabolic syndrome, obesity and diabetes, which may be related to the effects of coffee and its bioactive components on lipid metabolism.

Hydrogen sulfide plays a crucial role in the maintenance and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that have the potential to differentiate to a diverse group of mesenchymally derived cells. It was shown that these cells show a heavy reliance on cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS)-derived hydrogen sulfide (HS) during differentiation. We have found that expression and activity of 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST), one of three enzymes that hat regulates HS biosynthesis, is significantly lower in MSC as compared with lineage-restricted dermal fibroblasts. Here, we tested the hypothesis that suppression of MPST in dermal fibroblasts might induce plasticity-related changes and broaden the transdifferentiation potency. Inactivation of MPST with phenylpyruvate (PP) or by siRNA silencing led to diminished HS production associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lactic acid. Accumulation of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), a key metabolite required for the expression of ten-eleven translocation hydroxylase (TET), was associated with stimulated transcription of pluripotency related genes including OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and NANOG. Suppression of TET1 gene and inhibition of glycolysis with glucose analog, 2-desoxy-d-glucose, or hexokinase II inhibitor significantly reduced expression of pluripotency genes following MPST inactivation or knockdown. MPST disruption promoted the conversion of fibroblasts into adipocytes as evidenced by a significant increase in expression of adipocyte-specific genes, PPARγ, and UCP1, and intracellular accumulation of oil Red-O positive fat droplets. Inhibition of glycolysis inhibited these changes. Under induced differentiation conditions, fibroblasts with disrupted MPST show the potency to differentiate to white adipogenic lineage. Thus, MPST inactivation or silencing enhances the plasticity of dermal fibroblasts in a TET1 and glycolysis dependent manner and promotes adipogenic transdifferentiation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The expression of the genes and miRNAs and protein levels were evaluated using real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. To investigate the potential role of miR-33b in lipid accumulation, the mimic of the miR-33b was transfected into HepG2 cells. We found that metformin reduces high glucose-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells through inhibiting of SREBP1c and FAS and increasing the expression of CPT1 and CROT. Overexpression of miR-33b significantly prevented the decreasing effect of metformin on lipid content and intra and extra triglyceride levels. Importantly, miR-33b mimic inhibited the increasing effects of metformin on the expression of CPT1 and CROT. These findings suggest that metformin attenuates high glucose-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cell by downregulating the expression of miR-33b.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644978>Cafestol increases fat oxidation and energy expenditure in Caenorhabditis elegans via DAF-12-dependent pathway.</a></h2><p>Cafestol, a coffee diterpene, is a known agonist of farnesoid X receptors (FXR), which are involved in cholesterol homeostasis.

Autologous fat transfer may reduce radiotherapy-related tissue injury but graft survival is compromised by the fibrotic microenvironment. Elevated expression of Receptor for Hyaluronan-mediated motility (HMMR/RHAMM) in wounds decreases  and increases fibrosis. We therefore developed RHAMM peptide mimetics to block RHAMM pro-fibrotic signaling following radiation. We propose that this blocking peptide will decrease radio-fibrosis and establish a microenvironment favoring adipose-derived stem cell survival using a rat mammary fat pad model.Rats mammary fat pads underwent a one-time radiation dose of 26 Gy. Radiated (n=10) and non-radiated (n=10) fat pads received a single intra-mammary injection of a sham injection or peptide NP-110. Skin changes were examined clinically. Mammary fat pad tissue was processed for fibrotic and adipogenic markers using QPCR and immunohistochemistry.Clinical assessments and molecular analysis confirmed radiation-induced acute skin changes and radiation-induced fibrosis in rat mammary fat pads. Peptide treatment reduced fibrosis as detected by polarized microscopy of picrosirius red staining, increased collagen 3:1 ratio, reduced expression of collagen-1 crosslinking enzymes lysyl-oxidase, transglutaminase 2 and TGFβ1 protein m and increased adiponectin, an anti-fibrotic adipokine.

These osteoporotic conditions are associated with oxidative stress and hyperglycemia which are both considered as critical factors underlying bone fragility. Glucose excess and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to favor  over osteoblastogenesis. In this study, we investigated whether high glucose exposure could determine dysfunction of mature BMAds, specifically through ROS production. The effects of low (LG, 5 mM) or high glucose (HG, 25 mM) concentrations were examined using human bone mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSCs) in the time course of differentiation, and, up to 21 days once adipocytes were mature. HG did not alter the adipocyte differentiation process of hBMSCs. Yet, after 21 days under HG exposure, , and adiponectin mRNA expressions were decreased. These alterations were also observed following adipogenic inducer withdrawal as well as in adipocytes fully differentiated in LG then cultured in HG for the last 11 days. Without inducers, HG condition also led to decreased leptin mRNA level. Importantly, intracellular and extracellular ROS concentrations measured using Amplex Red were significantly raised by 50% under HG exposure. This rise was observed once adipocytes ended differentiation and was reproduced within the different cell culture settings without any cytotoxicity. Among genes involved in ROS metabolism, the mRNA level of the HO generating enzyme NOX4 was found upregulated in the presence of HG. Following cell separation, mature BMAds were shown to overproduce ROS and to display the gene alterations in contrast to non-lipid-laden cells. Finally, a non-lethal treatment with a pro-oxidant agent under LG condition reduces the mRNA levels of , adiponectin, and leptin as the HG condition does in the absence of inducers, and amplifies the effect of glucose excess on gene expression. HG concentration drives mature BMAds toward altered expression of the main adipokines and transcriptional factors. These perturbations are associated with a rise in ROS generation likely mediated through enhanced expression of . Mature BMAds are thus responsive to changes in glucose and ROS concentrations, which is relevant regarding with their phenotype and function in age- or metabolic disease-related osteoporosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640116>Age- and BMI-Associated Expression of Angiogenic Factors in White Adipose Tissue of Children.</a></h2><p>The growth of adipose tissue and its vasculature are tightly associated.

We found positive correlations of age with FGF1 and FGF2 and a negative correlation with ANGPT2, with pronounced differences in the first two years of life. FGF1, FGF2, and ANGPT1 correlated positively with adipocyte size. Furthermore, we identified a correlation of ANGPT1 and TEK with body mass index-standard deviation score (BMI-SDS), a measure to define childhood obesity. Except for ANGPT2, all angiogenic factors correlated positively with the endothelial marker VWF. In sum, our findings suggest that differences related to BMI-SDS begin early in childhood, and the analyzed angiogenic factors possess distinct roles in adipose tissue biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545773>Evaluation of the possible involvement of Ad-36-induced  and coronary artery disease development in mediastinal adipose tissue samples.</a></h2><p>Mediastinal fat has been suggested to be associated with cardiovascular diseases such as carotid stiffness, atherosclerosis and coronary artery calcification. We investigated the possible role of Ad-36-induced obesity in the pathogenesis of the coronary artery disease (CAD). Ad-36 DNA was investigated in the anterior mediastinal fat tissue samples of obese adults with CAD. Seventy-five obese adults with left main coronary artery (LMCA) disease, 28 non-obese adults with valvular heart diseases, and 48 healthy individuals without cardiovascular problems were included as the obese patient group (OPG), non-obese patient group (NOG) and healthy control group (HCG), respectively. We also simultaneously investigated Ad-36 antibodies by serum neutralization test (SNA), and measured leptin and adinopectin levels. Ad-36 antibodies were detected only in 10 patients (13.3%) within the 75 OPG. A statistically significant difference was detected between OPG, NOG and HCG in terms of Ad-36 antibody positivity (p>0.05). Ad-36 DNA was not detected in mediastinal tissue samples of OPG and NOP without PCR inhibitors. We suggest that Ad-36 may not have an affinity for mediastinal adipose tissue in obese patients with left main CAD and valvular heart diseases. Ad-36 antibody positivity results are not sufficient to reach a causal relationship.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660577>PLGA-collagen-ECM hybrid scaffolds functionalized with biomimetic extracellular matrices secreted by mesenchymal stem cells during stepwise osteogenesis-co-.</a></h2><p>A shift in osteogenesis toward  of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) is a crucial pathological factor in the progression of osteoporosis. The development of an in vitro three-dimensional (3D) model that reflects the dynamic remodeling of extracellular matrices (ECMs) during simultaneous osteogenesis and  of hMSCs can provide a useful tool to mimic the process and to investigate how 3D ECMs balance the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of hMSCs. In this study, ECMs secreted by hMSCs during their stepwise osteogenesis-co- were deposited on hybrid meshes of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and collagen to prepare biomimetic PLGA-collagen-ECM hybrid scaffolds. Four types of stepwise differentiation ECMs were prepared: ECMs secreted by hMSCs at early stages of osteogenesis and  (EOEA-ECMs), hMSCs at early stages of osteogenesis and late stages of  (EOLA-ECMs), hMSCs at late stages of osteogenesis and early stages of  (LOEA-ECMs) and hMSCs at late stages of osteogenesis and late stages of  (LOLA-ECMs). The deposited ECMs had different compositions that were dependent on the different stages of osteogenesis and . They also showed different effects on balancing the adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. The EOEA-ECM scaffold had a promotive effect on  and a suppressive effect on the osteogenesis of hMSCs. The LOEA-ECM and LOLA-ECM scaffolds showed a promotive effect on osteogenesis and a moderate effect on the adipogenic differentiation of hMSCs. The EOLA-ECM scaffold exhibited a suppressive effect on both osteogenesis and  of hMSCs. However, the EOLA-ECM scaffold promoted hMSC proliferation more strongly than the other ECM scaffolds. The results indicated that dynamically remodeling ECM scaffolds could affect the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of hMSCs and should provide a useful 3D cell culture model for the investigation of ECM-cell interactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557405>Aspirin inhibits  of tendon stem cells and lipids accumulation in rat injury tendon through regulating PTEN/PI3K/AKT signalling.</a></h2><p>Tendon injury repairs are big challenges in sports medicine, and fatty infiltration after tendon injury is very common and hampers tendon injury healing process. Tendon stem cells (TSCs), as precursors of tendon cells, have shown promising effect on injury tendon repair for their tenogenesis and tendon extracellular matrix formation. Adipocytes and lipids accumulation is a landmark event in pathological process of tendon injury, and this may induce tendon rupture in clinical practice. Based on this, it is important to inhibit TSCs  and lipids infiltration to restore structure and function of injury tendon. Aspirin, as the representative of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), has been widely used in tendon injury for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions, but effect of aspirin on TSCs  and fatty infiltration is still unclear. Under  conditions, TSCs were treated with concentration gradient of aspirin. Oil red O staining was performed to observe changes of lipids accumulation. Next, we used RNA sequencing to compare profile changes of gene expression between induction group and aspirin-treated group. Then, we verified the effect of filtrated signalling on TSCs . At last, we established rat tendon injury model and compared changes of biomechanical properties after aspirin treatment. The results showed that aspirin decreased lipids accumulation in injury tendon and inhibited TSCs . RNA sequencing filtrated PTEN/PI3K/AKT signalling as our target. After adding the signalling activators of VO-Ohpic and IGF-1, inhibited  of TSCs was reversed. Still, aspirin promoted maximum loading, ultimate stress and breaking elongation of injury tendon. In conclusion, by down-regulating PTEN/PI3K/AKT signalling, aspirin inhibited  of TSCs and fatty infiltration in injury tendon, promoted biomechanical properties and decreased rupture risk of injury tendon. All these provided new therapeutic potential and medicine evidence of aspirin in treating tendon injury and tendinopathy.© 2019 The Authors.

Considering the imitations in the reconstructive surgeries in restoring tissue loss and deficiency, stem cell-based therapy, in particular, has been expected to pave the way for a new solution to the regenerative approaches. Limitations in the reconstructive surgeries in restoring tissue loss and deficiency have paved the way for new regenerative approaches. Among them, adipose-derived stem/progenitor cells (ADSCs)-based therapy could be the most promising clue, since ADSCs have pluripotent differentiation capabilities not only in adipocytes but also in a variety of cell types. Accumulating evidences have indicated that the unfavorable development of adipose-tissue damage, namely, lipodystrophy, is a systemic complication, which is closely related to metabolic abnormality. Considering ADSC-based regenerative medicine should be applied for the treatment of lipodystrophy, it is inevitable to ascertain whether the ADSCs obtained from the patients with lipodystrophy are capable of being used. It will be very promising and realistic if this concept is applied to lipoatrophy; one form of lipodystrophies that deteriorates the patients' quality of life because of excessive loss of soft tissue in the exposed areas such as face and extremities. Since lipodystrophy is frequently observed in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the present study aims to examine the biological potentials of ADSCs isolated from the HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy associated with the HAART treatment. Growth properties, adipogenic differentiation, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were examined in ADSCs from HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients. Our results clearly demonstrated that ADSCs from both patients showed indistinguishable growth properties and potentials for adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Thus, although the number of cases were limited, ADSCs isolated from the patients with lipodystrophy retain sufficient physiological and biological activity for the reconstitution of adipose-tissue, suggesting that ADSCs from the patients with lipodystrophy could be used for autologous ADSC-based regenerative therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511929>Deficiency in AIM2 induces inflammation and  in white adipose tissue leading to obesity and insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) is a cytosolic sensor for double-stranded DNA and a tumour suppressor. Binding of double-stranded DNA to AIM2 forms the AIM2 inflammasome, leading to activation of caspase-1 and production of IL-1β and IL-18. Although inflammasome-independent effects of AIM2 have been reported, its role in energy metabolism is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the effect of AIM2 in energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis.Male and female whole body Aim2 knockout (Aim2) mice were used in the current study. Body weight, food intake, body composition, energy expenditure, fasting blood glucose levels, GTT and body temperature were measured at indicated time points. RNA sequencing was carried out on gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) in 14-month-old female mice. mRNA and protein levels in tissues were analysed by quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblot. Immune cell infiltration in gWAT was examined by flow cytometry. Stromal vascular fractions isolated from gWAT were used to investigate adipocyte differentiation.Male and female Aim2 mice were obese compared with wild-type controls from 7 weeks of age until 51 weeks of age, with increased adiposity in both subcutaneous and visceral fat depots. While there were no differences in food intake, Aim2 mice demonstrated decreased energy expenditure and impaired brown adipose tissue function compared with wild-type controls. Fasting glucose and insulin levels were elevated, and Aim2 mice were glucose intolerant on intraperitoneal GTT. RNA sequencing revealed marked upregulation of the IFN-inducible gene Ifi202b, which encodes protein 202 (p202) and elevated inflammatory signalling in gWAT of Aim2 mice. Increased infiltration of total and Ly6C monocytes was noted at 8 weeks of age in gWAT, before the onset of obesity and insulin resistance. Ifi202b knockdown blocked  in stromal vascular fractions and reduced inflammation in bone marrow-derived macrophages, demonstrating a key role of p202 in mediating the increased  and inflammation in Aim2 mice.These results demonstrate a fundamental role for AIM2 in energy metabolism, inflammation and insulin resistance. Our studies establish a novel link between the innate immunity proteins, AIM2 and p202, and metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682874>Leucine increases mitochondrial metabolism and lipid content without altering insulin signaling in myotubes.</a></h2><p>Elevated circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) such as leucine have been consistently correlated with increasing severity of insulin resistance across numerous populations. BCAA may promote insulin resistance through either mTOR-mediated suppression of insulin receptor substrate-1 or through the accumulation of toxic BCAA catabolites. Although the link between circulating BCAA and insulin resistance has been consistent, it has yet to be concluded if BCAA causally contribute to the development or worsening of insulin resistance. This work investigated the effect of leucine both with and without varying levels of insulin resistance on metabolism, metabolic gene expression, and insulin signaling. C2C12 myotubes were treated with and without varied concentrations of leucine up to 2mM for 24 hours both with and without varied levels of insulin resistance. Gene and protein expression were measured via qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Mitochondrial metabolism was measured via O consumption. Leucine at 2mM increased oxidative metabolism as well as gene expression of mitochondrial biogenesis, which was associated with increased cellular lipid content. Despite increased lipid content of leucine-treated cells, neither acute nor chronic leucine treatment at 2mM affected insulin signaling in insulin sensitive, mildly insulin resistant, or severely insulin resistant cells. Similarly, leucine at lower concentrations (0.25mM, 0.5mM, and 1mM) did not alter insulin signaling either, regardless of insulin resistance. Leucine appears to improve myotube oxidative metabolism and related metabolic gene expression. And despite increased lipid content of leucine-treated cells, leucine does not appear to alter insulin sensitivity either acutely or chronically, regardless of level of insulin resistance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

ELOVL fatty acid elongase 6 (Elovl6) is responsible for converting C16 saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (FAs) into C18 species. We have previously shown that Elovl6 contributes to obesity-induced insulin resistance by modifying hepatic C16/C18-related FA composition. To define the precise molecular mechanism by which hepatic Elovl6 affects energy homeostasis and metabolic disease, we generated liver-specific Elovl6 knockout (LKO) mice. Unexpectedly, LKO mice were not protected from high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance. Instead, LKO mice exhibited higher insulin sensitivity than controls when consuming a high-sucrose diet (HSD), which induces . Hepatic patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (Pnpla3) expression was downregulated in LKO mice, and adenoviral Pnpla3 restoration reversed the enhancement in insulin sensitivity in HSD-fed LKO mice. Lipidomic analyzes showed that the hepatic ceramide(d18:1/18:0) content was lower in LKO mice, which may explain the effect on insulin sensitivity. Ceramide(d18:1/18:0) enhances protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity by interfering with the binding of PP2A to its biological inhibitor I2PP2A, leading to Akt dephosphorylation. Its production involves the formation of an Elovl6-ceramide synthase 4 (CerS4) complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a Pnpla3-CerS4 complex on lipid droplets (LDs). Consistent with this, liver-specific Elovl6 deletion in ob/ob mice reduced both hepatic ceramide(d18:1/18:0) and PP2A activity, and ameliorated insulin resistance. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the key role of hepatic Elovl6 in the regulation of the acyl-chain composition of ceramide, and that C18:0-ceramide is a potent regulator of hepatic insulin signaling linked to Pnpla3-mediated NAFLD.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514306>Connexin43 is Dispensable for Early Stage Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Adipogenic Differentiation But is Protective against Cell Senescence.</a></h2><p>In the last couple of decades, there has been a growing optimism surrounding the potential transformative use of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for regenerative medicine and disease treatment. In order for this to occur, it is first essential to understand the mechanisms underpinning their cell-fate specification, which includes cell signaling via gap junctional intercellular communication. Here, we investigated the role of the prototypical gap junction protein, connexin43 (Cx43), in governing the differentiation of iPSCs into MSCs and MSC differentiation along the adipogenic lineage. We found that control iPSCs, as well as iPSCs derived from oculodentodigital dysplasia patient fibroblasts harboring a  (Cx43) gene mutation, successfully and efficiently differentiated into LipidTox and perilipin-positive cells, indicating cell differentiation along the adipogenic lineage. Furthermore, the complete CRISPR-Cas9 ablation of Cx43 from iPSCs did not prevent their differentiation into bona fide MSCs or pre-adipocytes, strongly suggesting that even though Cx43 expression is upregulated during , it is expendable. Interestingly, late passage Cx43-ablated MSCs senesced more quickly than control cells, resulting in failure to properly differentiate in vitro. We conclude that despite being upregulated during , Cx43 plays no detectable role in the early stages of human iPSC-derived MSC adipogenic differentiation. However, Cx43 may play a more impactful role in protecting MSCs from premature senescence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573846>The Antagonist of CXCR1 and CXCR2 Protects db/db mice from Metabolic Diseases through Modulating Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Interleukin-8 (IL-8，also named CXCL8) binds to its receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2) with subsequent recruitment of neutrophils and enhancement of their infiltration into inflamed sites, which exaggerates inflammation in many diseases. Recent studies have proposed metabolic disorders can be attenuated by counteracting certain inflammatory signal pathways. In this study, we examined whether intervention with G31P, an antagonist of CXCL8, could attenuate tissue inflammation and development of metabolic disorders in db/db mice. The db/m and db/db mice were injected with G31P or equivalent normal saline for six weeks. The physical and metabolic parameters, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, hepatic lipid accumulation, and inflammation markers were measured. G31P improved hepatic insulin sensitivity by modulating expression of genes related to gluconeogenesis and phosphorylated AKT level. The expressions of several genes encoding proteins involved in de novo  (DNL) were decreased in G31P-treated db/db mice. Meanwhile, immune cells infiltration and cytokines release were attenuated in db/db mice with G31P treatment. G31P also improved the ratio of pro-inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Furthermore, G31P ameliorates inflammation-associated metabolic disorders via inhibition of CXCR1 and CXCR2 pathways. These data suggest the selective inhibition of CXC chemokines may have therapeutic effect on inflammation and its related metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569605>Bilobalide Suppresses  in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes via the AMPK Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>Bilobalide, the only sesquiterpene compound from  leaf, exhibits various beneficial pharmaceutical activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammation, and protective effects for the central nervous system. Several bioactive components extracted from  extract reportedly have the potential to attenuate lipid metabolism. However, the effect of bilobalide on lipid metabolism remains unclear. In this study, we used 3T3-L1 cells as the cell model to investigate the effect of bilobalide on . The results showed that bilobalide inhibited 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation and intracellular lipid accumulation. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting results indicated that several specific adipogenic transcription factors and a few important -related genes were significantly down regulated on both mRNA and protein levels in bilobalide treatment groups. By contrast, the expression of some lipolytic genes, such as adipose triglyceride lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase (), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1α, were all up-regulated by bilobalide treatment, and the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, and HSL were stimulated. Furthermore, bilobalide treatment partially restored AMPK activity following its blockade by compound C (dorsomorphin). These results suggested that bilobalide inhibited  and promoted lipolysis in 3T3-L1 cells by activating the AMPK signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615399>Identification of differentially expressed genes and pathways between intramuscular and abdominal fat-derived preadipocyte differentiation of chickens in vitro.</a></h2><p>The distribution and deposition of fat tissue in different parts of the body are the key factors affecting the carcass quality and meat flavour of chickens. Intramuscular fat (IMF) content is an important factor associated with meat quality, while abdominal fat (AbF) is regarded as one of the main factors affecting poultry slaughter efficiency. To investigate the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and molecular regulatory mechanisms related to adipogenic differentiation between IMF- and AbF-derived preadipocytes, we analysed the mRNA expression profiles in preadipocytes (0d, Pre-) and adipocytes (10d, Ad-) from IMF and AbF of Gushi chickens.AbF-derived preadipocytes exhibited a higher adipogenic differentiation ability (96.4% + 0.6) than IMF-derived preadipocytes (86.0% + 0.4) (p < 0.01). By Ribo-Zero RNA sequencing, we obtained 4403 (2055 upregulated and 2348 downregulated) and 4693 (2797 upregulated and 1896 downregulated) DEGs between preadipocytes and adipocytes in the IMF and Ad groups, respectively. For IMF-derived preadipocyte differentiation, pathways related to the PPAR signalling pathway, ECM-receptor interaction and focal adhesion pathway were significantly enriched. For AbF-derived preadipocyte differentiation, the steroid biosynthesis pathways, calcium signaling pathway and ECM-receptor interaction pathway were significantly enriched. A large number of DEGs related to lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and preadipocyte differentiation, such as PPARG, ACSBG2, FABP4, FASN, APOA1 and INSIG1, were identified in our study.This study revealed large transcriptomic differences between IMF- and AbF-derived preadipocyte differentiation. A large number of DEGs and transcription factors that were closely related to fatty acid metabolism, lipid metabolism and preadipocyte differentiation were identified in the present study. Additionally, the microenvironment of IMF- and AbF-derived preadipocyte may play a significant role in adipogenic differentiation.

In an effort to better understand this process we found an intersection of Nrf2/NLE2F2 (Nrf2), epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metabolic alterations using multiple in vitro and in vivo approaches. Nrf2 is a key transcription factor controlling the expression of redox regulators to establish cellular redox homeostasis. Nrf2 has been shown to exert both cancer inhibitory and stimulatory activities. Using multiple isogenic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, we observed a reduction of Nrf2 protein and activity in a prometastatic mesenchymal cell state and increased reactive oxygen species. Knockdown of Nrf2 promoted a mesenchymal phenotype and reduced glycolytic, TCA cycle and lipogenic output from both glucose and glutamine in the isogenic cell models; while overexpression of Nrf2 promoted a more epithelial phenotype and metabolic reactivation. In both Nrf2 knockout mice and in NSCLC patient samples, Nrf2 was co-correlated with markedly decreased expression of glycolytic, lipogenic, and mesenchymal RNAs. Conversely, Nrf2 was associated with partial mesenchymal epithelial transition and increased expression of metabolic RNAs. The impact of Nrf2 on epithelial and mesenchymal cancer cell states and metabolic output provide an additional context to Nrf2 function in cancer initiation and progression, with implications for therapeutic inhibition of Nrf2 in cancer treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31508172>EFFECT OF HYPEROSIDE ON THE INHIBITION OF  IN 3T3-L1 ADIPOCYTES.</a></h2><p>The inhibition of adipocyte differentiation has a significant role on the prevention of obesity and obesity-associated complications.In this study, we aimed to detect whether hyperoside is able to inhibit the conversion of pre-adiposits into mature adiposits.3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were stimulated so as to differentiate into mature adipocytes. Hyperoside in non-cytotoxic concentrations (1, 2, 5, and 10 µM) were separately applied to differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. Oil red O staining was performed and triacylglycerol contents were measured. Furthermore, gene and protein expressions of transcription factors, adipogenic genes and adipokines were examined in order to investigate the effect of hyperoside on adipocyte differentiation.Hyperoside in high concentrations significantly suppressed the adipogenic process by inhibiting the expression of transcription factors and adipogenic genes and reducing lipid accumulation in adipocytes (p<0.05). Low doses of hyperoside are able to inhibit , but higher doses are needed to reduce fat accumulation in mature adipocytes. In the case of maturing preadipocytes, 5 μM of hyperoside exerts its antiadipogenic effect at the early stages of , whereas 10 μM of hyperoside acts at the later stages (p<0.05).These results suggest that hyperoside has a beneficial effect on the prevention and treatment of obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581971>Review: Enhancing intramuscular fat development via targeting fibro-adipogenic progenitor cells in meat animals.</a></h2><p>In the livestock industry, subcutaneous and visceral fat pads are considered as wastes, while intramuscular fat or marbling fat is essential for improving flavor and palatability of meat.

The expression of 2, a  gene copy, partially compensates for  disruption due to exon-7 excision in 90% of transcripts subsequently explaining the strong clinical heterogeneity. Several alterations in energy metabolism, like glucose intolerance and hyperlipidemia, have been reported in SMA at both systemic and cellular level, prompting questions about the potential role of energy homeostasis and/or production involvement in disease progression. In this context, we have recently reported the tolerance of mild SMA-like mice ( ) to 10 months of low-intensity running or high-intensity swimming exercise programs, respectively involving aerobic and a mix aerobic/anaerobic muscular metabolic pathways. Here, we investigated whether those exercise-induced benefits were associated with an improvement in metabolic status in mild SMA-like mice. We showed that untrained SMA-like mice exhibited a dysregulation of lipid metabolism with an enhancement of  and adipocyte deposits when compared to control mice. Moreover, they displayed a high oxygen consumption and energy expenditure through β-oxidation increase yet for the same levels of spontaneous activity. Interestingly, both exercises significantly improved lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis in SMA-like mice, and enhanced oxygen consumption efficiency with the maintenance of a high oxygen consumption for higher levels of spontaneous activity. Surprisingly, more significant effects were obtained with the high-intensity swimming protocol with the maintenance of high lipid oxidation. Finally, when combining electron microscopy, respiratory chain complexes expression and enzymatic activity measurements in muscle mitochondria, we found that (1) a muscle-specific decreased in enzymatic activity of respiratory chain I, II, and IV complexes for equal amount of mitochondria and complexes expression and (2) a significant decline in mitochondrial maximal oxygen consumption, were reduced by both exercise programs. Most of the beneficial effects were obtained with the high-intensity swimming protocol. Taking together, our data support the hypothesis that active physical exercise, including high-intensity protocols, induces metabolic adaptations at both systemic and cellular levels, providing further evidence for its use in association with SMN-overexpressing therapies, in the long-term care of SMA patients.Copyright © 2019 Houdebine, D’Amico, Bastin, Chali, Desseille, Rumeau, Soukkari, Oudot, Rouquet, Bariohay, Roux, Sapaly, Weill, Lopes, Djouadi, Bezier, Charbonnier and Biondi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645009>Cardamonin suppresses  by activating protein kinase A-mediated browning of 3T3-L1 cells.</a></h2><p>Obesity develops when dietary energy intake exceeds energy expenditure, and can be associated with metabolic syndrome. Recent studies have shown that dietary phytochemicals can promote energy expenditure by inducing the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT).This study investigated whether cardamonin induces the browning of 3T3-L1 adipocytes through the activation of protein kinase A (PKA).Anti-obesity potential of cardamonin was evaluated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Adipocyte-specific genes were observed using western blot, qPCR analysis and immunocytochemistry.Cardamonin treatment inhibited lipid droplet accumulation and reduced the expression of the adipogenic proteins C/EBPα and FABP4, and the lipogenic proteins LPAATθ, lipin 1, DGAT1, SREBP1, and FAS. Cardamonin also induced the expression of the browning marker genes PRDM16, PGC1α, and UCP1 at the mRNA and protein levels, and induced mRNA expression of CD137, a key marker of beige adipocytes. It also increased the expression of the β-oxidation genes CPT1 and PPARα at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, cardamonin increased PKA phosphorylation and the mRNA and protein expression of the downstream lipolytic enzymes adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).Our findings demonstrate novel effects of cardamonin to stimulate adipocyte browning, suppress , and promote lipolysis, implying it may have potential as an anti-obesity agent.Copyright © 2019.

This study aimed to assess whether adipose scaffolds could provide an environment for in situ autologous fat grafting, and to study whether adipose cell migration and proliferation () within scaffolds could be enhanced by preliminarily increasing the vascularity (preconditioning) of the surrounding tissue receiving the scaffolds.Using an established rodent model of subcutaneous tissue/scaffold grafting, the authors tested the potential of a human-derived, shelf-ready, injectable, decellularized allograft adipose matrix to reconstruct soft-tissue defects when used in combination with noninvasive mechanical (suction-induced) skin preconditioning.Combined use of the allograft adipose matrix and noninvasive skin preconditioning significantly improved long-term volume retention (50 to 80 percent higher at a 12-week follow-up) and histologic quality of reconstructed tissues compared with standard of care (autologous adipose grafts). The components of the allograft adipose matrix supported  and angiogenesis. Combining the allograft adipose matrix with living adipose grafts mitigated negative outcomes (lower long-term volume retention, higher presence of cystic-like areas).This study suggests that the synergistic use of the allograft adipose matrix and noninvasive tissue preconditioning provides an effective solution for improving fat grafting.

In the brain, NAA is considered an important energy metabolite for lipid synthesis. However, the role of NAA in peripheral tissues remained elusive. Therefore, we characterized the metabolic phenotype of knockout (ko) and adipose tissue-specific (ako) -ko mice as well as NAA-supplemented mice on various diets. We identified an important role of NAA availability in the brain during adolescence, as 75% of -ko mice died on fat-free diet (FFD) after weaning but could be rescued by NAA supplementation. In adult life, NAA deficiency promotes a beneficial metabolic phenotype, as -ko and -ako mice showed reduced body weight, increased energy expenditure, and improved glucose tolerance on chow, high-fat, and FFDs. Furthermore, -deficient adipocytes exhibited increased mitochondrial respiration, ATP synthesis, and an induction of browning. Conversely, NAA-treated wild-type mice showed reduced adipocyte respiration and lipolysis and increased  , culminating in reduced energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity. Mechanistically, our data point to a possible role of NAA as modulator of pancreatic insulin secretion and suggest NAA as a critical energy metabolite for adipocyte and whole-body energy homeostasis.-Hofer, D.

Using reporter assays and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in human cell lines, we characterized the role of the enhancer in . The enhancer was active during  and responded strongly to insulin and isoprenaline. The allele associated with increased waist-hip ratio in human genetic studies was associated with higher enhancer activity. Mutations of the enhancer resulted in less adipocyte differentiation. RNA sequencing of cells with disrupted enhancer showed reduced expression of established adipocyte markers, such as ADIPOQ and LPL, and identified CHI3L1 on chromosome 1 as a potential gene involved in adipocyte differentiation. In conclusion, we identified and characterized an enhancer in the SNX10 locus and outlined its plausible mechanisms of action and downstream targets.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a ligand-activated transcription factor, plays an important role in . Increased Nogo-B expression can be determined in the liver of cirrhosis patients. However, the effect of PPARγ activation on hepatic Nogo-B expression remains unknown. In this study, we found PPARγ activation by rosiglitazone or dephosphorylation increased Nogo-B expression at mRNA and protein levels in HepG2 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, we identified a PPARγ response element (PPRE) in Nogo-B promoter and found PPARγ enhanced Nogo-B transcription in a PPRE-dependent manner. ChIP assay further confirms rosiglitazone enhanced the binding of PPARγ to Nogo-B promoter. Using a liver specific PPARγ deficient mice, we determined the critical role of PPARγ expression in regulating hepatic Nogo-B expression. Increased glucose and palmitate in culture medium activated Nogo-B and PPARγ expression in mouse primary hepatocytes, and corresponding, high-fat diet (HFD) induced fatty liver associated with increased hepatic Nogo-B and PPARγ expression in mice. Similarly, serum Nogo-B levels in patients with NAFLD were increased. However, rosiglitazone treatment reduced HFD-induced fatty liver and Nogo-B expression. In summary, our study identifies Nogo-B as a new molecular target of PPARγ, and suggests increased Nogo-B might be a potential indicator for NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Tg6 mice with chronic erythropoietin overexpression have a high hematocrit, reduced trabecular and cortical bone and bone marrow adipocytes, and decreased bone morphogenic protein 2 driven ectopic bone and adipocyte formation. Erythropoietin treatment (1 200 IU·kg) for 10 days similarly exhibit increased hematocrit, reduced bone and bone marrow adipocytes without increased osteoclasts, and reduced bone morphogenic protein signaling in the bone marrow. Interestingly, endogenous erythropoietin is required for normal differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells to osteoblasts and bone marrow adipocytes. ΔEpoR mice with erythroid restricted erythropoietin receptor exhibit reduced trabecular bone, increased bone marrow adipocytes, and decreased bone morphogenic protein 2 ectopic bone formation. Erythropoietin treated ΔEpoR mice achieved hematocrit similar to wild-type mice without reduced bone, suggesting that bone reduction with erythropoietin treatment is associated with non-erythropoietic erythropoietin response. Bone marrow stromal cells from wild-type, Tg6, and ΔEpoR-mice were transplanted into immunodeficient mice to assess development into a bone/marrow organ. Like endogenous bone formation, Tg6 bone marrow cells exhibited reduced differentiation to bone and adipocytes indicating that high erythropoietin inhibits osteogenesis and , while ΔEpoR bone marrow cells formed ectopic bones with reduced trabecular regions and increased adipocytes, indicating that loss of erythropoietin signaling favors  at the expense of osteogenesis. In summary, endogenous erythropoietin signaling regulates bone marrow stromal cell fate and aberrant erythropoietin levels result in their impaired differentiation.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604693>RNF20 Functions as a Transcriptional Coactivator for PPARγ by Promoting NCoR1 Degradation in Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue is the key organ to coordinate whole-body energy homeostasis.

In addition, high-fat diet-fed   mice alleviated systemic insulin resistance accompanied by a reduced expansion of fat tissue. Quantitative proteomic analyses revealed significantly decreased levels of PPARγ target proteins in adipose tissue of   mice. Mechanistically, RNF20 promoted proteasomal degradation of nuclear corepressor 1 (NCoR1), which led to stimulation of the transcriptional activity of PPARγ.

Although LPZ target tissues remain poorly understood, possible sites of action include adipose tissue. In this study, we assessed effects of LPZ on adipocyte differentiation and function by using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and HFD-induced obesity mice as an in vitro and in vivo model, respectively.Oil red O staining and intracellular triacylglycerol content were used to determine lipid accumulation. Glucose uptake was performed to measure mature adipocyte function. Expression of adipocyte genes was determined by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting.LPZ has dual effects on differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. At low concentrations, LPZ enhanced adipocyte differentiation via induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα, two master adipogenic transcription factors, as well as lipogenic proteins, ACC1 and FASN. Increasing of adipocyte number subsequently increased basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and expression of Glut4 mRNA. Conversely, high concentrations of LPZ strongly inhibited differentiation and expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, and maintained expression of preadipocytes markers, β-catenin and Pref-1. Inhibition of  by LPZ reduced mature adipocyte number, Glut4 mRNA expression and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In addition, treatment with LPZ at 200 mg/kg significantly reduced body weight gain and total fat mass in HFD-induced obese mice.These results indicate that effects of LPZ on adipocyte differentiation are dependent on concentration and are correlated with PPARγ and C/EBPα.Copyright © 2019.

However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different microbiota is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different fat-to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the microbiota and early-stage metabolic syndrome.

Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic acid, cholestan-3-ol (5β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with  and inflammation. Our study suggests that different metabolic-syndrome-inducing diets may result in different microbiota but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Various types of diet can lead to type 2 diabetes. The gut microbiota in type 2 diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut microbiota induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease. Here we found that high-energy diets with two different fat-to-sugar ratios can both cause obesity and prediabetes but enrich different gut microbiota. Still, these different gut microbiota have similar genetic and metabolite compositions.

Although, glutamine is known to activate mTOR, if/how differential mitochondrial utilization of glutamine impinges on mTOR signalling is less explored. Mitochondrial SIRT4, which unlike other sirtuins is induced in a fed state, is known to inhibit catabolic signalling/pathways through AMPK-PGC1α/SIRT1-PPARα axis and negatively regulate glutamine metabolism via TCA cycle. However, physiological significance of SIRT4 functions during a fed state is still unknown. Here, we establish SIRT4 as key anabolic factor that activates TORC1 signalling and regulates , autophagy and cell proliferation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the ability of SIRT4 to inhibit anaplerotic conversion of glutamine to α-ketoglutarate potentiates TORC1. Interestingly, we also show that mitochondrial glutamine sparing or utilization is critical for differentially regulating TORC1 under fed and fasted conditions. Moreover, we conclusively show that differential expression of SIRT4 during fed and fasted states is vital for coupling mitochondrial energetics and glutamine utilization with anabolic pathways. These significant findings also illustrate that SIRT4 integrates nutrient inputs with mitochondrial retrograde signals to maintain a balance between anabolic and catabolic pathways.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657341>[Large tumor suppressor gene 2-mediated Hippo signaling pathway regulates the biological behavior of mesenchymal stem cells in vitro].</a></h2><p>To investigate the regulatory effect of Hippo signaling pathway mediated by large tumor suppressor gene 2 (LATS2) on biological behavior of mice bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in vitro.BMSCs of C57BL/6 mice were cultured in vitro and passed to the 6th to 7th generations for experiment.

The mRNA and protein expressions of LATS2, phosphorylation of Yes associated protein (p-YAP) and 14-3-3 were quantified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western Blot respectively. Osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs were evaluated through alizarin red and oil red O staining. Proliferation of BMSCs was evaluated using the CCK-8 assay.

The anti-obesity effect of EA and/or BO was assessed by measuring body weight, adipocyte size, lipid accumulation, and expression level of genes associated with . We found the administration of EA and/or BO significantly attenuated increases in body weight gain, adipocyte size, and lipid accumulation in obese mice induced by HFD. In addition, western blot analysis revealed that HFD-mediated increases in expressions levels of adipogenic genes such as PPARγ, C/EBPα, and SREBP-1c were diminished by EA and/or BO. Moreover, EA and/or BO significantly stimulated the production of adiponectin, a unique adipokine known to stimulate the breakdown of fat/lipids, whereas adiponectin levels were reduced in mice fed a HFD. Notably, a combination of EA and BO was more effective at modulating such parameters than EA or BO alone. Taken together, these results demonstrate that an anti-obesity effect of EA and/or BO can reduce adipocyte hypertrophy and modulate the expression of -associated genes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It is well known that insulin resistance, especially hepatic insulin resistance, is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Current research has shown that hepatic fatty acid accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased gluconeogenesis, , chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway. Mitochondria are the major sites of fatty acid β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of fatty acids. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty acid-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty acid accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608255> Inhibits Adipogenic Differentiation of 3T3-L1 Pre-Adipocytes via Downregulation of PPARγ and MAPK Pathways.</a></h2><p>, the Korean mugwort, is an edible plant that has various beneficial effects on health, and which has been used as a part of traditional folk medicine.

The purpose of our study was to determine the effect of resveratrol (0-50 μM) on HPA-v proliferation and differentiation, and the role of LMO3 in resveratrol-mediated regulation of HPA-v differentiation. Resveratrol inhibited HPA-v proliferation and differentiation in a dose-dependent manner, and significantly decreased the mRNA expression levels of PPARG, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (CEBPA), fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and fatty acid synthase (FAS) (p < 0.05) at 10, 20, and 50 μM. The mRNA and protein levels of LMO3 were significantly reduced by ≥20 μM resveratrol (p < 0.05), and overexpression of LMO3 partially attenuated resveratrol-induced reduction of HPA-v differentiation by enhancing the PPARG transcriptional activity.

We have characterized the effects of one such BB-associated serum PA, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid (PPA), on senescence signaling and promotion of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation toward osteoblasts, while suppressing  in the stem cells. To better understand the mechanistic actions of PPA on bone formation in vivo, we administered four doses of PPA (0.1, 0.5, 1, and 5 mg/kg/day; daily i.p.) to 1-month-old female C57BL6/J mice for 30 days. We did not observe significant effects of PPA on cortical bone; however, there were significantly higher bone volume and trabecular thickness and increased osteoblastic cell number, but decreased osteoclastic cell number in PPA-treated groups compared to controls. These morphological and cellular outcomes of bone were reflected in changes of bone formation markers in serum and bone marrow plasma. PPA treatment reduced senescence signaling as evaluated by senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, PPARγ, p53, and p21 expression in bone. In conclusion, PPA is capable of altering the mesenchymal stem cell differentiation program and bone cell senescence. This raises the possibility that BB-rich diets promote bone growth through increasing systemic PAs, a question that merits additional investigation. © 2019 The Authors.  published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.© 2019 The Authors.

This is due in part to the limited capacity of VIS fat to buffer lipids allowing them to deposit in insulin-sensitive tissues. Mechanisms underlying selective hypertrophic growth and tissue remodeling properties of VIS fat are not well understood. We identified subsets of adipose progenitors (APs) unique to VIS fat with differential Cd34 expression and adipogenic capacity. VIS low (Cd34 low) APs are adipogenic, whereas VIS high (Cd34 high) APs are not. Furthermore, VIS high APs inhibit adipogenic differentiation of SUB and VIS low APs in vitro through the secretion of soluble inhibitory factor(s). The number of VIS high APs increased with adipose tissue expansion, and their abundance in vivo caused hypertrophic growth, fibrosis, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction. This study unveils the presence of APs unique to VIS fat involved in the paracrine regulation of  and tissue remodeling.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

The underlying molecular mechanisms and therapeutic effects of AZGP1 remain unknown in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).To explore the effects and potential mechanism of AZGP1 on NAFLD  and .The expression of AZGP1 and its effects on hepatocytes were examined in NAFLD patients, CCl-treated mice fed a high fat diet (HFD), and human LO2 cells.AZGP1 levels were significantly decreased in liver tissues of NAFLD patients and mice. AZGP1 knockdown was found to activate inflammation; enhance steatogenesis, including promoting  [sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c, liver X receptor (LXR), fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD)-1], increasing lipid transport and accumulation [fatty acid transport protein (FATP), carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT)-1A, and adiponectin], and reducing fatty acid β-oxidation [farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α]; accelerate proliferation; and reverse apoptosis in LO2 cells. AZGP1 overexpression (OV-AZGP1) had the opposite effects. Furthermore, AZGP1 alleviated NAFLD by blocking TNF-α-mediated inflammation and intracellular lipid deposition, promoting proliferation, and inhibiting apoptosis in LO2 cells. Finally, treatment with OV-AZGP1 plasmid dramatically improved liver injury and eliminated liver fat in NAFLD mice.AZGP1 attenuates NAFLD with regard to ameliorating inflammation, accelerating lipolysis, promoting proliferation, and reducing apoptosis by negatively regulating TNF-α. AZGP1 is suggested to be a novel promising therapeutic target for NAFLD.©The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

The present study aimed to evaluate the mechanisms of inhibiting lipid accumulation in free fatty acid (FFA)-treated HepG2 cells caused by bark and fruit extracts of  (TSB and TSF). FFA induced lipid and triglyceride (TG) accumulation, which was attenuated by TSB and TSF. TSB and/or TSF promoted phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-coA carboxylase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha upregulation. Furthermore, TSB and TSF suppressed FFA-induced liver X receptor, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription protein 1, fatty acid synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 protein expression. Moreover, TSB and/or TSF induced phosphorylation of Unc-51 like autophagy-activating kinase and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 expressions. Therefore, TSB and TSF relieve lipid accumulation by attenuating lipogenic protein expression, activating the AMPK pathway, and upregulating the autophagic flux to enhance lipid metabolism.

Here, we report upregulated Mecp2 in white adipose tissues (WAT) of obese humans, as well as in obese mice and during  . Normal chow-fed adipocyte-specific Mecp2 knockout mice (  KO mice) showed a lean phenotype, with downregulated lipogenic genes and upregulated thermogenic genes identified using RNA-sequencing. Consistently, deficiency of Mecp2 in adipocytes protected mice from HFD-induced obesity and inhibited  . Furthermore,   KO mice showed increased browning under different stimuli, including cold treatment. Mechanistically, Mecp2 bound to the promoter of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor () and negatively regulated its expression. Knockdown of  in iWAT of   KO mice prevented cold-induced browning. Moreover, recombinant SLPI treatment reduced the HFD-induced obesity via enhancing browning.

In our previous study, we showed bitter melon extract (BME) prevents carcinogen induced mouse oral cancer. RNA sequence analysis from mouse tongue revealed a significant modulation in "Metabolic Process" by altering glycolysis and lipid metabolic pathways in BME fed group as compared to cancer group. In present study, we evaluated the effect of BME on glycolysis and lipid metabolism pathways in human oral cancer cells.Cal27 and JHU022 cells were treated with BME. RNA and protein expression were analysed for modulation of glycolytic and  genes by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot analyses and immunofluorescence. Lactate and pyruvate level was determined by GC/MS. Extracellular acidification and glycolytic rate were measured using the Seahorse XF analyser. Shotgun lipidomics in Cal27 and JHU022 cell lines following BME treatment was performed by ESI/ MS. ROS was measured by FACS.Treatment with BME on oral cancer cell lines significantly reduced mRNA and protein expression levels of key glycolytic genes SLC2A1 (GLUT-1), PFKP, LDHA, PKM and PDK3. Pyruvate and lactate levels and glycolysis rate were reduced in oral cancer cells following BME treatment. In  pathway, we observed a significant reduction of genes involves in fatty acid biogenesis, ACLY, ACC1 and FASN, at the mRNA and protein levels following BME treatment. Further, BME treatment significantly reduced phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and plasmenylethanolamine, and reduced iPLA2 activity. Additionally, BME treatment inhibited lipid raft marker flotillin expression and altered its subcellular localization. ER-stress associated CHOP expression and generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were induced by BME, which facilitated apoptosis.Our study revealed that bitter melon extract inhibits glycolysis and lipid metabolism and induces ER and oxidative stress-mediated cell death in oral cancer. Thus, BME-mediated metabolic reprogramming of oral cancer cells will have important preventive and therapeutic implications along with conventional therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690632>Hepatic stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 deficiency increases glucose uptake in adipose tissue partially through the PGC-1α-FGF21 axis in mice.</a></h2><p>Increased carbohydrate consumption increases hepatic de novo , which has been linked to the development of chronic metabolic diseases, including obesity, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance. Stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is a critical lipogenic enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of two monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), oleate and palmitoleate, from the saturated fatty acids, stearate and palmitate, respectively. SCD1-deficient mouse models are protected against diet-induced adiposity, hepatic steatosis, and hyperglycemia. However, the mechanism of this protection by SCD1 deficiency is unclear. Using a liver-specific SCD1 knockout (LKO) mouse model fed a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet (HCD), we show that hepatic SCD1 deficiency increases systemic glucose uptake. Hepatic SCD1 deficiency enhanced glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) expression in the liver and also up-regulated GLUT4 and adiponectin expression in the adipose tissue. The enhanced glucose uptake correlated with increased liver expression and elevated plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a hepatokine known to increase systemic insulin sensitivity and to regulate whole-body lipid metabolism. Feeding LKO mice with triolein-supplemented, but not tristearin-supplemented, HCD reduced FGF21 expression and plasma levels. Consistently, SCD1 inhibition in primary hepatocytes induced FGF21 expression, which was repressed by treatment with oleate but not palmitoleate. Moreover, deletion of the transcriptional coactivator PPARg coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) reduced hepatic and plasma FGF21 and white adipocyte tissue-specific GLUT4 expression and raised plasma glucose levels in the LKO mice. These results suggest that hepatic oleate regulates glucose uptake in adipose tissue either directly or partially by modulating the hepatic PGC-1α-FGF21 axis.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603067>Effects of dietary lipid level on growth, fatty acid profiles, antioxidant capacity and expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism in juvenile swimming crab, .</a></h2><p>The regulation of  and lipolysis mechanisms related to consumption of lipid has not been studied in swimming crab. The aims of present study were to evaluate the effects of dietary lipid levels on growth, enzymes activities, and expression of genes of lipid metabolism in hepatopancreas of juvenile swimming crab. Three isonitrogenous diets were formulated to contain crude lipid levels at 5.8 %, 9.9 % and 15.1 %, respectively. Crabs fed the diet containing 15.1 % lipid had significantly lower weight gain, specific growth rate and survival, and higher feed conversion ratio than those fed the 5.8 % and 9.9 % lipid diets. Crabs fed 5.8 % lipid had lower malondialdehyde concentrations in the hemolymph and hepatopancreas than those fed the other diets. Highest glutathione peroxidase in hemolymph and superoxide dismutase in hepatopancreas were observed in crabs fed 5.8 % lipid. The lowest fatty acid synthase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities in hepatopancreas were observed in crabs fed 15.1 % lipid, whereas crabs fed 5.8 % lipid had lower carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 activity than those fed the other diets. Crabs fed 15.1 % lipid showed lower hepatopancreas expression of genes involved in LC-PUFA biosynthesis, lipoprotein clearance, fatty acid uptake, fatty acid oxidation, lipid anabolism and lipid catabolism than those fed the other diets, whereas expression of some genes of lipoprotein assembly and fatty acid oxidation were up-regulated compared with crabs fed 5.8 % lipid. Overall, high dietary lipid level can inhibit growth, reduce feed utilization and reduce antioxidant enzyme activities. Moreover, dietary lipid influenced enzyme activities and gene expression involved in lipid metabolism of juvenile swimming crab.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520202>Inhibition of intestinal lipases alleviates the adverse effects caused by high-fat diet in Nile tilapia.</a></h2><p>Intestinal lipases are fat-digesting enzymes, which play vital roles in lipid absorption in the intestine. To study the regulation of intestinal lipase activity in systemic lipid metabolism in fish, especially in the metabolic diseases caused by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, we inhibited intestinal lipases in Nile tilapia to investigate the physiological consequences. In the present study, Nile tilapia were firstly fed with HFD (12% fat) for 6 weeks to establish a fatty fish model. Afterwards, Orlistat as a potent intestinal lipase inhibitor was added into the HFD for the following 5-week feeding trial, with two dietary doses (Orlistat16 group, 16 mg/kg body weight; Orlistat32 group, 32 mg/kg body weight). After the trial, both doses of Orlistat treatment significantly reduced intestinal lipase activity, fat absorption, hepatic lipid accumulation, and gene expression of , whereas increased gene expression of lipid catabolism. Moreover, intestinal lipase inhibition increased immune enzyme activities, antioxidant capacity, and gene expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, whereas lowered gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Besides, Orlistat could also improve the structure of the intestine and increase expression of intestinal tight-coupling protein. Taken together, intestinal lipase inhibition alleviated the adverse effects caused by HFD in Nile tilapia. Thus, intestinal lipases played key roles in absorbing dietary lipid and could be a promising target in regulating systemic lipid metabolism in fish.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652837>Deregulated Lysophosphatidic Acid Metabolism and Signaling in Liver Cancer.</a></h2><p>Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide due to late diagnosis and scarcity of treatment options. The major risk factor for liver cancer is cirrhosis with the underlying causes of cirrhosis being viral infection (hepatitis B or C), metabolic deregulation (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the presence of obesity and diabetes), alcohol or cholestatic disorders. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid with numerous effects, most of them compatible with the hallmarks of cancer (proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, evasion of apoptosis, deregulated metabolism, neoangiogenesis, etc.). Autotaxin (ATX) is the enzyme responsible for the bulk of extracellular LPA production, and together with LPA signaling is involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, fibrosis and cancer. This review discusses the most important findings and the mechanisms related to ATX/LPA/LPAR involvement on metabolic, viral and cholestatic liver disorders and their progression to liver cancer in the context of human patients and mouse models. It focuses on the role of ATX/LPA in NAFLD development and its progression to liver cancer as NAFLD has an increasing incidence which is associated with the increasing incidence of liver cancer. Bearing in mind that adipose tissue accounts for the largest amount of LPA production, many studies have implicated LPA in adipose tissue metabolism and inflammation, liver steatosis, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and . At the same time, LPA and ATX play crucial roles in fibrotic diseases. Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually developed on the background of liver fibrosis, therapies that both delay the progression of fibrosis and prevent its development to malignancy would be very promising. Therefore, ATX/LPA signaling appears as an attractive therapeutic target as evidenced by the fact that it is involved in both liver fibrosis progression and liver cancer development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644264>Quantification of Dehydroepiandrosterone, 17β-Estradiol, Testosterone, and Their Sulfates in Mouse Tissues by LC-MS/MS.</a></h2><p>We report a high-performance, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) assay to quantify without derivatizaton dehyroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 17β-estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), and their sulfates in serum and tissues. This assay functions well with multiple adipose depots, a previously unattained analysis. To delipidate and facilitate recovery, tissues were homogenized in acetonitrile, and the homogenate was frozen. The supernatant was evaporated, resuspended in an aqueous acetate buffer, and extracted with hexane to separate free (unconjugated) from sulfated steroids. Sulfated steroids in the aqueous medium were then hydrolyzed with sulfatase and extracted with hexane. Each extract was analyzed separately. HPLC resolution combined with the sensitivity and specificity of MS/MS allowed quantification of DHEA, E2, and T with 10, 10, and 5 fmol lower limits of quantification and linear ranges to 1 pmol. Application of the method to mouse serum and tissues reveals ranges of DHEA, E2, and T and their sulfates, and tissue-specific differences in steroid profile, especially white versus brown adipose. In addition, marginal decreases of T in all tissues and considerable increases in DHEA in male iWAT and eWAT in response to a high-fat diet further strengthen the inference regarding the role of steroid metabolism in .

Emerging evidence indicates that exposure to environmental stressors is associated with abnormal foetal development. However, how prenatal exposure to diesel exhaust PM (DEP) predisposes adult offspring to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains unclear. To examine this, C57BL/6J mice were exposed to DEP or a vehicle before conception and during pregnancy and fed normal chow or a high-fat diet. Then, the hepatic fatty accumulation in the adult male offspring and possible molecular mechanisms were assessed. Our data showed that prenatal exposure to DEP on normal chow led to hepatic steatosis in adult male offspring with normal liver function. However, prenatal DEP exposure relieved the hepatic steatosis and liver function in offspring of mice fed a high-fat diet. Furthermore, prenatal exposure to DEP on normal chow increased  and worsened fatty acid oxidation. The counteractive effect of prenatal DEP exposure on high-fat-diet-induced hepatic steatosis was produced through upregulated adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase, and this improved  and fatty acid oxidation. Collectively, prenatal exposure to DEP programmed the development of NAFLD differently in the adult male offspring of mice fed normal chow and a high-fat diet, showing the pleotrophic effects of exposure to adverse environmental factors in early life.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we compared the immunophenotype and the differentiation potential of human vascular wall mesenchymal stem cells (hVW-MSCs) with those of human dermal fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Cell morphology and surface markers were evaluated by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry; functional assays for immunomodulation, angiogenesis,  and osteogenesis were performed, together with the mRNA analysis of the critical differentiation genes. hVW-MSCs, dermal fibroblasts and myofibroblasts were all negative to CD34, whereas the expression of CD44 stemness marker was more intense in hVW-MSCs. As expected, hVW-MSC plasticity was wide and the angiogenic, adipogenic, osteogenic features were confirmed. Fibroblasts were the less effective in terms of immunomodulation, angiogenesis and adipogenic differentiation; differently from fibroblasts, the myofibroblasts showed a poor angiogenic commitment. The mineralization assay was positive in all the three cell types, but ultrastructure interestingly evidenced differential osteogenic patterns among them. Our study supports the higher anti-inflammatory and wound healing repair features of hVW-MSCs, in comparison to the other stromal cells investigated.

Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) are the ideal source to study fat formation as they are the progenitors of adipocytes. In this work, we used human MSCs, received from surgery waste, and differentiated them into fat adipocytes. The combination of several layers of information coming from lipidomics, metabolomics and proteomics enabled network analysis of the biochemical pathways in . Simultaneous analysis of metabolites, lipids, and proteins in cell culture is challenging due to the compound's chemical difference, so most studies involve separate analysis with unimolecular strategies. In this study, we employed a multimolecular approach using a two-phase extraction to monitor the crosstalk between lipid metabolism and protein-based signaling in a single sample (~10 cells). We developed an innovative analytical workflow including standardization with in-house produced C isotopically labeled compounds, hyphenated high-end mass spectrometry (high-resolution Orbitrap MS), and chromatography (HILIC, RP) for simultaneous untargeted screening and targeted quantification. Metabolite and lipid concentrations ranged over three to four orders of magnitude and were detected down to the low fmol (absolute on column) level. Biological validation and data interpretation of the multiomics workflow was performed based on proteomics network reconstruction, metabolic modelling (MetaboAnalyst 4.0), and pathway analysis (OmicsNet). Comparing MSCs and adipocytes, we observed significant regulation of different metabolites and lipids such as triglycerides, gangliosides, and carnitine with 113 fully reprogrammed pathways. The observed changes are in accordance with literature findings dealing with adipogenic differentiation of MSC. These results are a proof of principle for the power of multimolecular extraction combined with orthogonal LC-MS assays and network construction. Considering the analytical and biological validation performed in this study, we conclude that the proposed multiomics workflow is ideally suited for comprehensive follow-up studies on  and is fit for purpose for different applications with a high potential to understand the complex pathophysiology of diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672515>The potential efficacy of dietary fatty acids and fructose induced inflammation and oxidative stress on the insulin signaling and fat accumulation in mice.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to clarify whether oxidative stress and inflammatory responses are related to impaired insulin signaling and fat accumulation induced by the dietary fatty acids and fructose. C57BL/6 type 8 week-old male mice (n = 10/per group) were fed with standard chow or three isocaloric diets consisting fructose, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), or saturated fatty acid (SFA) for 15 weeks. After the dietary manipulation, the mice were sacrificed, tissues and blood were collected. Consequently, body weight gains, liver weights, and plasma homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values in were at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). The plasma concentrations of the non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), triglyceride (TG), and liver steatosis were found to be at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (ACC1), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) in the liver were affected by the intake of SFA and fructose. Furthermore, the plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) and the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in the liver were elevated in SFA and fructose group (p < 0.05). The plasma level of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL -10) was found to be lower in the SFA group compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the inflammation and oxidation are related with the fatty acid- and fructose-induced impaired insulin signaling and fat accumulation in liver.

However, its treatment mechanisms remain largely unknown. The study aimed to explain the molecular mechanisms of adipogenic differentiation from ASCs based on the roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs).Datasets of mRNA-lncRNA (GSE113253) and miRNA (GSE72429) expression profiling were collected from Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs), lncRNAs (DELs) and miRNAs (DEMs) between undifferentiated and adipocyte differentiated human ASCs were identified using the Linear Models for Microarray Data method. DELs related co-expression and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were constructed.

The conditioning media of those co-cultures were harvested and added to AD ongoing differentiation from ob-ASC. , insulin sensitivity and secretion of inflammatory cytokines were then measured using qRT-PCR, Western blots and ELISAs, respectively.Surprisingly, we did not observe any direct effect of IL-17A on ob-ASC , despite sensitivity of ob-ASC to IL-17A. Moreover, IL-17A blockade, with the help of Secukinumab, did not lead to the recovery of  and insulin response, when these functions were impaired by the presence of an inflammatory conditioning medium. However, the up-regulation of IL6 and IL1B mRNA expression by AD submitted to inflammatory conditioning medium was inhibited in the presence of Secukinumab, which indicates that IL-17A may play a role in the propagation of inflammation towards AD.we show herein that IL-17A does not play a major role in the impairment of  and/or insulin resistance mediated by an inflammatory environment, but contributes to the propagation of inflammation in human obese adipose tissues. This suggests a beneficial effect of anti-IL17A mAb in inflammatory pathologies, where obesity contributes to poorer response to biologic treatments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In mammals, a broadly conserved metabolic effect of CR is improved insulin sensitivity, which may mediate the beneficial effects of a CR diet. This model has been challenged by the identification of interventions that extend lifespan and healthspan yet promote insulin resistance. These include rapamycin, which extends mouse lifespan yet induces insulin resistance by disrupting mTORC2 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2). Here, we induce insulin resistance by genetically disrupting adipose mTORC2 via tissue-specific deletion of the mTORC2 component Rictor (AQ-RKO). Loss of adipose mTORC2 blunts the metabolic adaptation to CR and prevents whole-body sensitization to insulin. Despite this, AQ-RKO mice subject to CR experience the same increase in fitness and lifespan on a CR diet as wild-type mice. We conclude that the CR-induced improvement in insulin sensitivity is dispensable for the effects of CR on fitness and longevity.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659183>S-nitrosoglutathione inhibits  in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by S-nitrosation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β.</a></h2><p>Murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes share many similarities with primary fat cells and represent a reliable in vitro model of . The aim of this study was to probe the effect of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) on adipocyte differentiation.  was induced with a mixture of insulin, dexamethasone, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine in the absence and presence of increasing GSNO concentrations. Biochemical analysis after 7 days of differentiation showed a prominent anti-adipogenic effect of GSNO which was evident as reduced cellular triglycerides and total protein content as well as decreased mRNA and protein expression of late transcription factors (e.g. peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ) and markers of terminal differentiation (e.g. leptin). By contrast, the nitrosothiol did not affect mRNA and protein expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), which represents a pivotal early transcription factor of the adipogenic cascade. Differentiation was also inhibited by the NO donor (Z)-1-[2-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate. Biotin switch experiments showed significantly increased S-nitrosation of C/EBPβ variants indicating that posttranslational S-nitrosative modification of this transcription factor accounts for the observed anti-adipogenic effect of NO. Our results suggest that S-nitrosation might represent an important physiological regulatory mechanism of fat cell maturation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603892>A functional regulatory variant of MYH3 influences muscle fiber-type composition and intramuscular fat content in pigs.</a></h2><p>Muscle development and lipid accumulation in muscle critically affect meat quality of livestock. However, the genetic factors underlying myofiber-type specification and intramuscular fat (IMF) accumulation remain to be elucidated. Using two independent intercrosses between Western commercial breeds and Korean native pigs (KNPs) and a joint linkage-linkage disequilibrium analysis, we identified a 488.1-kb region on porcine chromosome 12 that affects both reddish meat color (a*) and IMF. In this critical region, only the MYH3 gene, encoding myosin heavy chain 3, was found to be preferentially overexpressed in the skeletal muscle of KNPs. Subsequently, MYH3-transgenic mice demonstrated that this gene controls both myofiber-type specification and  in skeletal muscle. We discovered a structural variant in the promotor/regulatory region of MYH3 for which Q allele carriers exhibited significantly higher values of a* and IMF than q allele carriers. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation and cotransfection assays showed that the structural variant in the 5'-flanking region of MYH3 abrogated the binding of the myogenic regulatory factors (MYF5, MYOD, MYOG, and MRF4). The allele distribution of MYH3 among pig populations worldwide indicated that the MYH3 Q allele is of Asian origin and likely predates domestication. In conclusion, we identified a functional regulatory sequence variant in porcine MYH3 that provides novel insights into the genetic basis of the regulation of myofiber type ratios and associated changes in IMF in pigs. The MYH3 variant can play an important role in improving pork quality in current breeding programs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511221>[Risedronate inhibits rat bone marrow  and reduces RANKL expression in adipocytes].</a></h2><p>To investigate the effects of risedronate on bone marrow  and the expression of the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) in adipocytes in the bone marrow micro-environment.Primary cultured rat mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) with or without adipogenic induction for 14 days were treated with 1, 5, 10, and 25 μmol/L risedronate. The droplets of the differentiated adipocytes were analyzed, and Western blotting was performed to detect the expression level of RANKL. Female SD rats (24-week-old) were randomly divided into sham-operated group and ovariectomy (OVX) group, and 12 weeks after the operation, the OVX rats were further divided into control group and risedronate group (2.4 μg/kg, injected subcutaneously for 3 times a week). Eight weeks later, the bone mineral density (BMD) of the rats and bone marrow histopathology of the femurs was examined to evaluate the effect of risedronate on the fat fraction in the bone marrow.Risdronate significantly inhibited adipogenic differentiation of rat BMSCs and suppressed RANKL expression in the adipocytes derived from the BMSCs in a concentration-dependent manner. In OVX rats, risdronate treatment significantly increased the BMD and decreased the fat content in the bone marrow.Risdronate can effectively inhibit the adipogenic differentiation of rat BMSCs, decrease fat content in the bone marrow, and suppress the generation and function of osteoclasts by down-regulating the expression of RANKL, which can be an important mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of risedronate against osteoporosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573052>Biological effects of melatonin on human adipose‑derived mesenchymal stem cells.</a></h2><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are capable of differentiating into other cell types and exhibit immunomodulatory effects. MSCs are affected by several intrinsic and extrinsic signaling modulators, including growth factors, cytokines, extracellular matrix and hormones. Melatonin, produced by the pineal gland, is a hormone that regulates sleep cycles. Recent studies have shown that melatonin improves the therapeutic effects of stem cells. The present study aimed to investigate whether melatonin enhances the biological activities of human adipose‑derived MSCs. The results demonstrated that treatment with melatonin promoted cell proliferation by inducing SRY‑box transcription factor 2 gene expression and preventing replicative senescence. In addition, melatonin exerted anti‑adipogenic effects on MSCs. PCR analysis revealed that the expression of the CCAAT enhancer binding protein a gene, a key transcription factor in , was decreased following melatonin treatment, resulting in reduced adipogenic differentiation in an in vitro assay. The present study also examined the effect of melatonin on the immunomodulatory response using a co‑culture system of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and MSCs. Activated T cells were strongly inhibited following melatonin exposure compared with those in the control group. Finally, the favorable effects of melatonin on MSCs were confirmed using luzindole, a selective melatonin receptor antagonist. The proliferation‑promoting, anti‑inflammatory effects of melatonin suggested that melatonin‑treated MSCs may be used for effective cell therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585505>Deficiency in the short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protects mice against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (CADs) participate in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation; abnormal fatty acid oxidation is associated with obesity and related metabolic disorders. We decipher the impact of short-chain CAD (SCAD) on adiposity and insulin resistance. BALB/cBy strain mice derived from BALB/c strain are deficient in SCAD activity because of a spontaneous deletion in the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases () gene. Adiposity, , and insulin sensitivity were compared in BALB/c and BALB/cBy mice subjected to high-fat diets (HFDs). A whole hepatic transcriptome profiling experiment with microarrays was performed to evaluate the mechanisms by which SCAD deficiency protects against insulin resistance. -deficient mice were significantly resistant to HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance as compared with control mice. Reduced obesity results from decreased triglyceride content due to activation of AMPK in liver that would reduce hepatic content of malonyl-CoA, resulting in decreased hepatic  . Improved insulin sensitivity was associated with reduced diacylglycerol content commensurate with reduced PKC-ε activity and increased protein kinase B (AKT) activation in liver and skeletal muscle. Additionally, -deficient mice displayed significantly higher expression of the endoplasmic chaperone 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein, which was further associated with the AKT activation in the primary hepatocytes.

With this approach, we aimed to evaluate adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) and mature adipocytes (MA) comparatively for the application in the in vitro setup of adipose tissue constructs to imitate native adipose tissue physiology. We used human primary MAs and human ASCs, differentiated for 14 days, and encapsulated them in collagen type I hydrogels to build up a three-dimensional (3D) adipose tissue model. The maintenance of the models was analyzed after seven days based on a viability staining. Further, the expression of the adipocyte specific protein perilipin A and the release of leptin and glycerol were evaluated. Gene transcription profiles of models based on dASCs and MAs were analyzed with regard to native adipose tissue. Compared to MAs, dASCs showed an immature differentiation state. Further, gene transcription of MAs suggests a behavior closer to native tissue in terms of angiogenesis, which supports MAs as preferred cell type. In contrast to native adipose tissue, genes of de novo  and tissue remodeling were upregulated in the in vitro attempts.Copyright © 2019 International Society of Differentiation.

The objectives of the present study were to establish an economical and efficient animal model, mimicking pathophysiology of human T2DM to understand probable molecular mechanisms in context with lipid metabolism. In the present study, male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups. Animals were fed with high fat diet (HFD) except healthy control (HC) for 12 weeks. After eight weeks, intra peritoneal glucose tolerance test was performed. After confirmation of glucose intolerance, diabetic control (DC) group was injected with streptozotocin (STZ) (35 mg/kg b.w., i.p.). HFD fed rats showed increase ( ≤ 0.001) in glucose tolerance and HOMA-IR as compared to HC. Diabetes rats showed abnormal ( ≤ 0.001) lipid profile as compared to HC. The hepatocyte expression of transcription factors  and  and their target genes were found to be upregulated, while  and  expressions were downregulated as compared to the HC.

Reactive oxygen species play a key role in the regulation of  and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by adipocytes. Quercetin (QCT) regulates  by affecting the redox state of preadipocytes. Ochratoxin A (OTA) is one of the most prevalent mycotoxins contaminating food. It has cytotoxic, genotoxic, pro-inflammatory, and anti-adipogenic effects. Antioxidants are believed to protect cells from the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity induced by OTA.

One of the effects of androgen deficiency is the disturbance in the homeostasis of lipid metabolism. Till date, there are no effective compounds developed to treat androgen deficiency without having any side effects. Nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are a promising solution for various clinical indications. In this study, we investigated the effect of ostarine (enobosarm), a nonsteroidal SARM, on the rat adipocyte metabolism using in vitro techniques. Isolated rat adipocytes were incubated in the presence of different concentrations of ostarine. Control incubation with testosterone as the natural ligand for AR was performed. AR inhibitors were used to investigate the genomic activity of ostarine. Changes in the intensity of lipolysis, , and the secretion of leptin and adiponectin were measured. Moreover, the gene expression of leptin and adiponectin was assessed. For the first time, we have shown that ostarine has a significant effect on the intensity of lipid metabolism. Ostarine downregulates the expression of leptin and adiponectin mRNAs, as well as decreases their release from rat adipocytes. According to our results, ostarine acts via AR with a similar effect as testosterone in the regulation of lipid metabolism and endocrine function of mature rat adipocytes in vitro.

The number of mature adipocytes is determined by adipocyte differentiation from preadipocytes. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effects of curcumin on  and the underlying mechanism. To examine cell toxicity of curcumin, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with 0-50 µM curcumin for 24, 48, or 72 h, then cell viability was measured using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The effect of curcumin on the cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry. Curcumin-induced cell apoptosis was determined by the TUNEL assay and curcumin-induced caspase activation was measured by immunoblotting. The effect of curcumin on adipocyte differentiation was determined by measuring mitotic clonal expansion (MCE), expression of adipogenic transcription factors, and lipid accumulation. Results showed the viability of preadipocytes was significantly decreased by treatment with 30 µM curcumin, a concentration that caused apoptosis in preadipocytes, as assessed by the TUNEL assay, and caused activation of caspases 8, 9, and 3. A non-cytotoxic dose of curcumin (15 µM) inhibited MCE, downregulated the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, prevented differentiation medium-induced β-catenin downregulation, and decreased the lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Due to incapacity to form new white adipocytes, adipose expansion in aged mice primarily depends on adipocyte hypertrophy, which induces metabolic dysfunction. On the other hand, brown adipose tissue burns fatty acids, preventing ectopic lipid accumulation and metabolic diseases. However, the capacity of brown/beige  declines inevitably during the aging process. Previously, we reported that DNA demethylation in the Prdm16 promoter is required for beige . DNA methylation is mediated by ten-eleven family proteins (TET) using alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) as a cofactor. Here, we demonstrated that the circulatory AKG concentration was reduced in middle-aged mice (10-month-old) compared with young mice (2-month-old). Through AKG administration replenishing the AKG pool, aged mice were associated with the lower body weight gain and fat mass, and improved glucose tolerance after challenged with high-fat diet (HFD). These metabolic changes are accompanied by increased expression of brown adipose genes and proteins in inguinal adipose tissue. Cold-induced brown/beige  was impeded in HFD mice, whereas AKG rescued the impairment of beige adipocyte functionality in middle-aged mice. Besides, AKG administration up-regulated Prdm16 expression, which was correlated with an increase of DNA demethylation in the Prdm16 promoter. In summary, AKG supplementation promotes beige  and alleviates HFD-induced obesity in middle-aged mice, which is associated with enhanced DNA demethylation of the Prdm16 gene.© 2019 The Authors.

In the current study, we demonstrate an important role of ceramide synthases (CerS) in ER stress and NAFLD progression. Ceramide is important in sphingolipid metabolism, and its acyl chain length is determined by a family of six CerS in mammals. CerS2 generates C22-C24 ceramides, and CerS5 or CerS6 produces C16 ceramide. To gain insight into the role of CerS in NAFLD, we used a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mouse model. Decreased levels of CerS2 and increased levels of CerS6 were observed in the steatotic livers of mice fed a HFD. In vitro experiments with Hep3B cells indicated the protective role of CerS2 and the detrimental role of CerS6 in the ER stress response induced by palmitate treatment. In particular, CerS6 overexpression increased sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) cleavage with decreased levels of INSIG-1, leading to increased . Blocking ER stress abrogated the detrimental effects of CerS6 on palmitate-induced SREBP-1 cleavage. In accordance with the protective role of CerS2 in the palmitate-induced ER stress response, CerS2 knockdown enhanced ER stress and SREBP-1 cleavage, and CerS2 heterozygote livers exhibited a stronger ER stress response and higher triglyceride levels following HFD. Finally, treatment with a low dose of bortezomib increased hepatic CerS2 expression and protected the development of NAFLD following HFD.

Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is expressed in divers tissues including adipose tissue (AT) and SM where it impacts a variety of remodeling as well as metabolic functions. SPARC, also known as osteonectin or BM-40, is a glycoprotein associated with the ECM. Numerous researches attempted to elucidate the implications of SPARC in these two key metabolic tissues under different conditions. Whereas SPARC deficiency tends to shape the remodeling of the adipocytes and the fat distribution, this deficiency decreases SM metabolic properties. On the other hand, SPARC seems to be an enhancer of the metabolism and a mediator of the exercise-induced adaptation in the SM and as well as an  inhibitor. Some findings about the SPARC effects on AT and SM seem "contradictory" in terms of tissue development and energy profile therefore highlighting the mechanistic role of SPARC in both is a priority. Yet, within this review, we expose selected researches and compare the results. We conclude with explanations to "reconcile" the different observations, hypothesize the feedback and regulatory character of SPARC and put its roles within the energetic and structural maps of both adipocytes and myocytes in homeostasis and in situations such as obesity or exercise. These properties explain the modifications and the remodeling seen in AT and SM undergoing adaptive changes (obesity, exercise, etc.) and represent a starting point for precise therapeutic targeting of SPARC-related pathways is conditions such as obesity, sarcopenia and diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The biochemical profiles and the ghrelin, leptin, lipoperoxidation and TNF-α levels in serum and the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), malic enzyme (ME) and NADP-dependent isocitric dehydrogenase (IDP) levels, the reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) and reduced/oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H/NAD(P)) ratios, and the levels of various lipogenic and fibrotic markers in the liver were evaluated. The results showed that hepatic fibrosis induced by fructose consumption was associated with weight gain, hunger-satiety system dysregulation, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, lipoperoxidation and inflammation. Moreover, increased levels of hepatic G6PD and ME activity and expression, the NAD(P)H/NAD(P) ratios, and GSSG concentration and increased expression of lipogenic and fibrotic markers were detected, and these alterations were attenuated by NAM administration. Specifically, NAM diminished the activity and expression of G6PD and ME, and this effect was associated with a decrease in the NADPH/NADP ratios, increased GSH levels and decreased lipoperoxidation and inflammation, ameliorating fibrosis and NASH development. NAM reduces liver steatosis and fibrosis by regulating redox homeostasis through a G6PD- and ME-dependent mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570772>Cannabinoid receptor 1 knockout alleviates hepatic steatosis by downregulating perilipin 2.</a></h2><p>The endocannabinoid (EC) system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several metabolic diseases, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). With the current study we aimed to verify the modulatory effect of endocannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1)-signaling on perilipin 2 (PLIN2)-mediated lipophagy. Here, we demonstrate that a global knockout of the cannabinoid receptor 1 gene (CB1) reduced the expression of the lipid droplet binding protein PLIN2 in the livers of CB1 and hepatitis B surface protein (HBs)-transgenic mice, which spontaneously develop hepatic steatosis. In addition, the pharmacologic activation and antagonization of CB1 in cell culture also caused an induction or reduction of PLIN2, respectively. The decreased PLIN2 expression was associated with suppressed  and triglyceride (TG) synthesis and enhanced autophagy as shown by increased colocalization of LC3B with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) in HBs/CB1 mice. The induction of autophagy was further supported by the increased expression of LAMP1 in CB1 and HBs/CB1 mice. LAMP1 and PLIN2 were co-localized in HBs/CB1 indicating autophagy of cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs) i.e., lipophagy. Lipolysis of lipid droplets was additionally indicated by elevated expression of lysosomal acid lipase. In conclusion, these results suggest that loss of CB1 signaling leads to reduced PLIN2 abundance, which triggers lipophagy. Our new findings about the association between CB1 signaling and PLIN2 may stimulate translational studies analyzing new diagnostic and therapeutic options for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563732>Effects of second-generation antipsychotics on human subcutaneous adipose tissue metabolism.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome is prevalent in up to 50% of schizophrenia patients, which reduces their quality of life and their compliance with the treatment. It is unclear whether metabolic adverse effects of these agents are due to their direct effect on insulin-sensitive tissues or are secondary to increased adiposity. The study aimed to investigate the direct effects of the second-generation antipsychotics olanzapine and aripiprazole on human subcutaneous adipose tissue and isolated adipocyte metabolism.Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue needle biopsies were taken from 72 healthy subjects (49 F/23 M; age: 19-78 yr; BMI: 20.0-35.6 kg/m). Isolated adipocytes or adipose tissue were respectively pre-incubated short- (30 min) and long-term (24 h, 72 h) with or without olanzapine (0.004 μM - 20 μM) and aripiprazole (0.002 μM - 100 μM). Pre-incubated adipose tissue was then snap-frozen for mRNA expression analysis of adipokines genes and genes involved in inflammation, , and mitochondrial function. Isolated adipocytes were used to measure basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and lipolysis.Acute treatment with a therapeutic concentration of olanzapine decreases basal lipolysis in isolated adipocytes; this effect was not observed after long-term incubation with the drug. Supra-therapeutic concentration of aripiprazole reduced basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake after short- and long-term pre-incubation. Both drugs at supra-therapeutic concentrations downregulated the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6 and IL1B genes after 72 h incubation. Similarly, supra-therapeutic concentrations of both drugs and therapeutic concentration of olanzapine, reduced the expression of PPARGC1A, PDK4, and CPT1B genes involved in the regulation of mitochondrial functions. Neither of the antipsychotics affected the expression of the main adipokines LEP and ADIPOQ, genes involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism, LPL and FASN, nor the master  regulator, PPARG.Therapheutic concentrations of olanzapine and aripiprazole have a moderate direct effect on adipocyte lipid and glucose metabolism, respectively. At supra-therapeutic concentrations, both of the antipsychotics seem to act as anti-inflammatory agents and mildly suppressed genes involved in the regulation of mitochondrial functions, which could potentially contribute to metabolic adverse effects. Alternatively, second-generation antipsychotics could induce metabolic side effects via acting on other insulin-sensitive tissues and central nervous system.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small endogenous non-coding RNAs, have been proven to play an important role in  by the post-transcriptional regulation of target genes. In this current study, we observed an increment of miR-152 expression during the process of 3T3-L1 cell audiogenic differentiation. A functional analysis indicated that the overexpression of miR-152 inhibited pre-adipocyte proliferation and suppressed the expression of some cell cycle-related genes. Moreover, the overexpression of miR-152 promoted lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes accompanied by increase of the expression of some pro-audiogenic genes. Additionally, a dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated lipoprotein lipase (LPL) was a direct target gene of miR-152 during preadipocyte differentiation. Further analysis showed that miR-152 was positively correlated with  and intramuscular fat formation in vivo. Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-152 could suppress 3T3-L1 preadipocyte proliferation, whereas it could promote 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation by negatively regulating LPL. The findings indicate that miR-152 might have a therapeutic significance for obesity and obesity-related metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668386>Fibroblast growth factor 21 is required for the therapeutic effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG against fructose-induced fatty liver in mice.</a></h2><p>High fructose feeding changes fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) regulation. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) supplementation reduces fructose-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to determine the role of FGF21 and underlying mechanisms in the protective effects of LGG.FGF21 knockout (KO) mice and C57BL/6 wild type (WT) mice were fed 30% fructose for 12 weeks. LGG was administered to the mice in the last 4 weeks during fructose feeding. FGF21-adiponectin (ADPN)-mediated hepatic  and inflammation were investigated.FGF21 expression was robustly increased after 5-weeks of feeding and significantly decreased after 12-weeks of feeding in fructose-induced NAFLD mice. LGG administration reversed the depressed FGF21 expression, increased adipose production of ADPN, and reduced hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation in the WT mice but not in the KO mice. Hepatic nuclear carbohydrate responsive-element binding protein (ChREBP) was increased by fructose and reduced by LGG, resulting in a reduction in the expression of lipogenic genes. The methylated form of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) C, which dephosphorylates and activates ChREBP, was upregulated by fructose and normalized by LGG. Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase-1, which methylates PP2AC, was also increased by fructose and decreased by LGG. However, those beneficial effects of LGG were blunted in the KO mice. Hepatic dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate, which inhibits PP2A, was markedly increased by LGG in the WT mice but attenuated in the KO mice. LGG decreased adipose hypertrophy and increased serum levels of ADPN, which regulates sphingosine metabolism. This beneficial effect was decreased in the KO mice.LGG administration increases hepatic FGF21 expression and serum ADPN concentration, resulting in a reduced ChREBP activation through dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate-mediated PP2A deactivation, and subsequently reversed fructose-induced NAFLD. Thus, our data suggest that FGF21 is required for the beneficial effects of LGG in reversal of fructose-induced NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

A portion of osteocalcin remains uncarboxylated (uncarboxylated osteocalcin, GluOC) that is released into blood where it functions as a hormone to regulate insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. As insulin resistance is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body insulin sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo  and promoting fatty-acid β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519114>GS-0976 (Firsocostat): an investigational liver-directed acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitor for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).</a></h2><p>:   (DNL) plays a major role in fatty acid metabolism and contributes significantly to triglyceride accumulation within the hepatocytes in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl CoA and is a rate-controlling step in DNL. Furthermore, malonyl-CoA is an important regulator of hepatic mitochondrial fat oxidation through its ability to inhibit carnitine palmitoyltransferase I. Therefore, inhibiting ACC pharmacologically represents an attractive approach to treating NASH. : This article summarizes preclinical and clinical data on the efficacy and safety of the liver-targeted ACC inhibitor GS-0976 (Firsocostat) for the treatment of NASH. In a phase 2 trial that included 126 patients with NASH and fibrosis, GS-0976 20 mg daily for 12 weeks showed significant relative reduction in liver fat by 29%; however, treatment was associated with an increase in plasma triglycerides with 16 patients having levels >500 mg/dL. : Preclinical and preliminary clinical data support the development of GS-0976 as treatment for NASH.

Although PI3K-AKT-mTORC1-p70S6K-signaling kinases are known to drive feed-forward expression of SREBP-1c, the identity of the phosphorylated amino acid residue(s) putatively involved in insulin-stimulated de novo  remains elusive. We obtained in silico and mass spectrometry evidence, that was combined with siRNA strategies, to discover that insulin-induced phosphorylation of serine 418, serine 419, and serine 422 in rat SREBP-1c was most likely mediated by p70S6 kinase. Here, for the first time, we show that insulin-induced phosphorylation of these 3 serine residues mainly impinged on the mechanisms of proteostasis of both full-length and mature SREBP-1c in the McArdle-RH7777 hepatoma cells. Consistent with this conclusion, nascent SREBP-1c, substituted with phosphomimetic aspartic acid residues at these 3 sites, was resistant to proteasomal degradation. As a consequence, endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi migration and proteolytic maturation of pSREBP-1c was significantly enhanced which led to increased accumulation of mature nSREBP-1c, even in the absence of insulin. Remarkably, aspartic acid substitutions at S418, S419 and S422 also protected the nascent SREBP-1c from ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation thus increasing its steady-state levels and transactivation potential in the nucleus. These complementary effects of p70S6K-mediated phosphorylation on proteostasis of pSREBP-1c were necessary and sufficient to account for insulin's ability to enhance transcription of genes controlling de novo  in hepatocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31543975>Risk of diabetes associated with fatty acids in the de novo  pathway is independent of insulin sensitivity and response: the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS).</a></h2><p>To examine the associations of fatty acids in the de novo  (DNL) pathway, specifically myristic acid (14:0), palmitic acid (16:0), palmitoleic acid (c16:1 n-7), myristoleic acid (c14:1n5), stearic acid (18:0) and oleic acid (c18:1 n-9), with 5-year risk of type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that DNL fatty acids are associated with risk of type 2 diabetes independent of insulin sensitivity.We evaluated 719 (mean age 55.1±8.5 years, 44.2% men, 42.3% Caucasians) participants from the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study. Multivariable logistic regression models with and without adjustment of insulin sensitivity were used to assess prospective associations of DNL fatty acids with incident type 2 diabetes.Type 2 diabetes incidence was 20.3% over 5 years. In multivariable regression models, palmitic, palmitoleic, myristic, myristoleic and oleic acids were associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (p<0.05). Palmitic acid had the strongest association (OR per standard unit of palmitic acid 1.46; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.76; p<0.001), which remained similar with addition of insulin sensitivity and acute insulin response (AIR) to the model (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.70, p=0.01). Oleic and palmitoleic acids were also independently associated with incident type 2 diabetes.

A series of studies has questioned the ubiquity of  in parasitoid wasps suggesting that the vast majority of species have lost the ability to synthesize fatty acids de novo. One such species is Nasonia vitripennis, which, like the congeneric species N. giraulti and N. longicornis, uses a fatty acid-derived male sex pheromone for sexual communication. Here we demonstrate by feeding fully C-labeled α-D-glucose and analyzing insect-derived fatty acid methyl esters and the male sex pheromone by coupled gas chromatography/mass spectrometry that both males and females of N. vitripennis as well as N. giraulti and N. longicornis are capable of synthesizing fatty acids de novo. We furthermore show by a proteomics approach that predicted fatty acid synthase, ATP-citrate synthase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, key enzymes of , are expressed in the male pheromone gland of N. vitripennis and N. giraulti. Labeling experiments with Urolepis rufipes, a closely related species producing a male sex pheromone independently of fatty acids via the mevalonate pathway, revealed that both sexes are likewise able to synthesize fatty acids de novo. We conclude that the parasitoid wasp species studied here, irrespective of the biosynthetic origin of their sex pheromones, are capable of responding flexibly to lipid shortage during their adult life by keeping enzymatic machinery for  running.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

CINP may even be a factor of interruption of treatment and consequently increasing the risk of death. Besides that, it is important to take into consideration that the incidence of cancer is increasing worldwide, including colorectal, gastric, lung, cervical, ovary and breast cancers, all treated with the aforementioned drugs, justifying the concern of the medical community about the patient's quality of life. Several physiopathological mechanisms have already been described for CINP, such as changes in axonal transport, mitochondrial damage, increased ion channel activity and inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). Another less frequent event that may occur after chemotherapy, particularly under oxaliplatin treatment, is the central neurotoxicity leading to disorders such as mental confusion, catatonia, hyporeflexia, etc. To date, no pharmacological therapy has shown satisfactory effect in these cases. In this scenario, duloxetine is the only drug currently in clinical use. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) belong to the class of nuclear receptors and are present in several tissues, mainly participating in lipid and glucose metabolism and inflammatory response. There are three PPAR isoforms: α, β/δ and γ. PPARγ, the protagonist of this review, is expressed in adipose tissue, large intestine, spleen and neutrophils. This subtype also plays important role in energy balance, lipid biosynthesis and . The effects of PPARγ agonists, known for their positive activity on type II diabetes mellitus, have been explored and present promising effects in the control of neuropathic pain, including CINP, and also cancer. This review focuses largely on the mechanisms involved in chemotherapy-induced neuropathy and the effects of the activation of PPARγ to treat CINP.

The TORC1 is a key regulator of  and its regulation in bovine intramuscular preadipocytes has not been studied. The TORC1 is a member of the gene family that codes for a binding proteins which regulate transcription of cAMP which, is a key regulator of . In the present study, expression and sub-cellular localization of the TORC1 gene was analyzed in bovine preadipocytes. Bioinformatics tools were applied to characterize TORC1. To investigate the molecular mechanism of bovine TORC1 gene regulation, we cloned a 1008 bp of the 5'UTR regulatory region into a luciferase reporter vector. Different fragments were amplified using 5'UTR unidirectional deletion of the TORC1 promoter. Site directed mutation, dual luciferase reporter assay, RNAi interference and DNA-protein interaction (EMSA) were used to validate the regulatory roles of Smad3 and NRF1 in the regulation of TORC1 gene in bovine preadipocytes. The core promoter region of the TORC1 gene was identified at a location -410 to -155 bp upstream of transcription start site. Different vectors were constructed through serial deletion of the 5'UTR flanking region and in combination with site directed mutations and transcription interference through siRNA or shRNA, two transcription factors of NRF1 and Smad3 were found to be repressors in the promoter of the TORC1 gene. These findings were further confirmed through Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) within nuclear extracts of bovine adipocytes. The core promoter region of the TORC1 gene, spanning from -410 to -155 bp upstream of the transcription start site was specified in this study and this information will provide opportunity for the improvement of intramuscular fat in cattle.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We have previously shown that exercise may amplify energy expenditure through energetically expensive nutrient deposition. Therefore, we investigated the effect of exercise on hepatic de novo  (DNL) during WLM and relapse to obesity. Obese rats were calorically restricted with (EX) or without (SED) treadmill exercise (1 h/day, 6 days/wk, 15 m/min) to induce and maintain weight loss. After 6 wk of WLM, subsets of WLM-SED and WLM-EX rats were allowed ad libitum access to food for 1 day to promote relapse (REL). An energy gap-matched group of sedentary, relapsing rats (REL-GM) were provided a diet matched to the positive energy imbalance of the REL-EX rats. During relapse, exercise increased enrichment of hepatic DN-derived lipids and induced hepatic molecular adaptations favoring DNL compared with the gap-matched controls. In the liver, compared with both REL-SED and REL-GM rats, REL-EX rats had lower hepatic expression of genes required for cholesterol biosynthesis; greater hepatic expression of genes that mediate very low-density lipoprotein synthesis and secretion; and greater mRNA expression of , which encodes an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of bile acids. Altogether, these data provide compelling evidence that the liver has an active role in exercise-mediated potentiation of energy expenditure during early relapse.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653658>Insights into lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle in dysferlin-deficient mice.</a></h2><p>Loss of dysferlin protein in humans results in Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B), characterized by progressive loss of muscles in the distal limbs with impaired locomotion. The Dysferlin null (Bla/J) mouse develops severe steatotic muscles upon aging. Here we report a marked increase in adipocytes, especially in psoas and gluteus, but not in soleus and tibialis anterior muscles in aged Bla/J mice compared to wild type mice. There is a robust upregulation in the mRNA expression of enzymes involved in  and triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis pathways. Lipidomic analysis reveals that the increase in TAG is at the expense of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine. The adipocytes in steatotic muscles are extra-myocellular, as determined by the increased expression of caveolin1 (a cellular marker for adipocytes) and lipid-droplet protein, perilipin1. This increase in adipocytes occurs as a consequence of the loss of myocytes.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612177>Perigestational high folic acid: impact on offspring's peripheral metabolic response.</a></h2><p>Offspring of dams exposed to excess folic acid during the perigestational period have been shown by us to be predisposed to metabolic dysfunction revealed by hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, increased insulin and decreased adiponectin in late adulthood. This work aims to characterize adipocyte phenotype and expression profile of genes in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism in visceral adipose tissue and in skeletal muscle. From mating until weaning, a recommended dose of folic acid for pregnancy (C, 2 mg of folic acid per kg of diet) or a high folic acid dose (HFA, 40 mg of folic acid per kg of diet) was administered to Sprague-Dawley females. At 10 months of age progeny were divided into groups fed the standard chow (C/STD and HFA/STD) and groups fed the standard chow plus drinking water with 10% fructose (C/FRU and HFA/FRU), as an additional metabolic challenge. Adipocyte morphology and quantification of key genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism were studied in visceral adipose tissue and skeletal muscle of 13 months old offspring. HFA exposure led to an enlargement of visceral adipose cells most likely mediated by an upregulation of lipoprotein lipase, and it tended to downregulate Glut4 in visceral adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Fructose exposure in a background of perigestational excess folic acid, but not in controls, induced an upregulation of  pathway genes and it decreased jejunal expression of the proton-coupled folate transporter (Pcft1). In addition, fructose exposure led to a downregulation of jejunal Sglt1 in control animals. Our data suggest that high folic acid exposure during the perigestational period caused morphologic and genic alterations related to insulin resistant states indicating that this intervention may act as an effective programmer of long-term metabolic dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609806>Propranolol Accelerats Hemangioma Stem Cell Transformation Into Adipocyte.</a></h2><p>Infantile hemangioma (IH) is the most common childhood benign vascular tumor. Recently, propranolol has been found to be an effective therapy for IH, but its mechanism of action is not yet understood. Hemangioma stem cells (HemSCs) have a mesenchymal morphology, robust proliferation, and multilineage differentiation (into adipocytes). Therefore, we hypothesized that propranolol could accelerate the transdifferentiation of HemSCs and prevent the growth of proliferating IH. In this study, the fibrofatty tissue of IH that received therapy with propranolol appeared much earlier than without the treatment.We isolated HemSCs with CD133-tagged immunomagnetic beads, and then we used flow cytometry technology to analyze the HemSC phenotypes and determine whether propranolol induced HemSC death. The proliferation and  abilities of propranolol-treated HemSCs were analyzed by 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo(-z-y1)-3,5-diphenytetrazoliumromide assay, Oil red O staining, and Western blotting.We observed that the HemSC morphological traits gradually became spindle shaped, like fibroblasts, and the average extraction yield of HemSCs was about 0.25%. The HemSCs had high rates of expression for CD90 (98.8%) and CD105 (97.8%) but did not significantly express CD31 (0.7%). We also found a 100 μM concentration of propranolol cutoff point. Propranolol did not affect HemSC survival significantly at low concentrations (6.25, 12.5, 25.0, and 50.0 μM). However, propranolol resulted in a sharp and significant variation in cell morphology and survival rates at high concentrations (100, 200, and 400 μM). The results suggest that treatment with propranolol inhibited HemSC proliferation and induced cell death and apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Oil droplets determined by Oil red O staining showed that propranolol increased the transdifferentiation rate of HemSCs into adipocytes. Furthermore, the expressions of phosphorylated AKT and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) were increased with a 100 μM concentration of propranolol in HemSC culture.Our study found that propranolol inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis and necrosis, and promoted differentiation of HemSCs.

We thus generated fatty acid-binding protein 4 (Fabp4)-GDF5 transgenic (TG) mice and showed that GDF5 TG mice developed a relative lean phenotype on a high-fat diet (HFD) and showed increased insulin sensitivity. Over expression of GDF5 in adipose tissues greatly promoted the thermogenic process in sWAT after cold or β3-agonist treatment. In TG mice, sWAT showed an important thermogenic effect as the thermogenic gene expression was markedly increased, which was consistent with the typical features of beige adipocytes. Moreover, knockdown of the protein GDF5 impaired browning program in sWAT after thermogenic stimuli. Enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) signaling was also identified in sWAT of HFD-fed GDF5 mice, and thermogenesis in mature adipocytes induced by GDF5 protein could be partly blocked by a p38 MAPK inhibitor. Taken together, our data suggest that GDF5 could improve insulin sensitivity and prevent metabolic syndrome, the adaptive thermogenesis in sWAT could mediate the obesity resistance effects of GDF5 in mice and partially resulted in the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606738>A role for Oncostatin M in the impairment of glucose homeostasis in obesity.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of OSM with the inflammatory state that leads to impaired glucose homeostasis in obesity. We also assessed whether OSM immunoneutralization could revert metabolic disturbances caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) in mice.28 patients with severe obesity were included and stratified into two groups: 1) glucose levels < 100 mg/dL and 2) glucose levels > 100 mg/dL. White adipose tissue was obtained to examine OSM gene expression. Human adipocytes were used to evaluate the effect of OSM in the inflammatory response, and HFD-fed C57BL/6J mice were injected with anti-OSM antibody to evaluate its effects.OSM expression was elevated in subcutaneous and visceral fat from patients with obesity and hyperglycemia, and correlated with Glut4 mRNA levels, serum insulin, HOMA-IR, and inflammatory markers. OSM inhibited  and induced inflammation in human adipocytes. Finally, OSM receptor knockout mice had increased Glut4 mRNA levels in adipose tissue, and OSM immunoneutralization resulted in a reduction of glucose levels and Ccl2 expression in adipose tissue from HFD-fed mice.OSM contributes to the inflammatory state during obesity and may be involved in the development of insulin resistance.© Endocrine Society 2019.

In this study, a mixture of HepG2 cells treated with free fatty acid (FFA)-palmitic and oleic acid-and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice were used; in this background, the triglyceride (TG) levels in HepG2 cells and mice liver were measured, and the expression levels of genes associated with , fatty acid oxidation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy were determined. Treatment of HepG2 cells with FFA enhanced intracellular TG levels in HepG2 cells, but co-treatment with PCW significantly attenuated the TG levels. Notably, PCW significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. PCW downregulated the expression of -related genes, but upregulated the expression of genes associated with fatty acid oxidation. Further, PCW inhibited FFA-induced expression of ER stress markers and induced autophagy proteins. However, inhibition of AMPK significantly attenuated the beneficial effects of PCW in HepG2 cells. Moreover, PCW efficiently decreased HFD-induced hepatic TG accumulation in vivo and increased the phosphorylation of hepatic AMPK. Three compounds present in PCW including poricoic acid, pachymic acid, and ergosterol, significantly decreased FFA-induced increase in intracellular TG levels, consistent with increased AMPK phosphorylation, suggesting that poricoic acid, pachymic acid, and ergosterol are responsible for PCW-mediated amelioration of hepatic steatosis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PCW ameliorates hepatic steatosis through the regulation of lipid metabolism, inhibition of ER stress, and activation of autophagy in an AMPK-dependent manner. This suggested that PCW can be potentially used for the treatment of hepatic steatosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546946>Hepatic Transcriptomics Reveals that  Is a Key Signaling Pathway in Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 2 Deficient Mice.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH2) plays a key role in the intermediary metabolism and energy production via catalysing oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Despite studies reporting potential interlinks between IDH2 and various diseases, there is lack of effort to comprehensively characterize signature(s) of IDH2 knockout (IDH2 KO) mice. A total of 6583 transcripts were identified from both wild-type (WT) and IDH2 KO mice liver tissues. Afterwards, 167 differentially expressed genes in the IDH2 KO group were short-listed compared to the WT group based on our criteria. The online bioinformatic analyses indicated that lipid metabolism is the most significantly influenced metabolic process in IDH2 KO mice. Moreover, the TR/RXR activation pathway was predicted as the top canonical pathway significantly affected by IDH2 KO. The key transcripts found in the bioinformatic analyses were validated by qPCR analysis, corresponding to the transcriptomics results. Further, an additional qPCR analysis confirmed that IDH2 KO caused a decrease in hepatic de novo  via the activation of the fatty acid β-oxidation process. Our unbiased transcriptomics approach and validation experiments suggested that IDH2 might play a key role in homeostasis of lipid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668395>MicroRNA-10a-5p regulates macrophage polarization and promotes therapeutic adipose tissue remodeling.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the role of microRNAs generated from adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) during adipose tissue remodeling induced by pharmacological and nutritional stimuli.Macrophage-specific Dicer knockout (KO) mice were used to determine the roles of microRNA generated in macrophages in adipose tissue remodeling induced by the β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL316,243 (CL). RNA-seq was performed to characterize microRNA and mRNA expression profiles in isolated macrophages and PDGFRα+ adipocyte stem cells (ASCs). The role of miR-10a-5p was further investigated in cell culture, and in adipose tissue remodeling induced by CL treatment and high fat feeding.Macrophage-specific deletion of Dicer elevated pro-inflammatory gene expression and prevented CL-induced de novo beige  in gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT). Co-culture of ASCs with ATMs of wild type mice promoted brown adipocyte gene expression upon differentiation, but co-culture with ATMs of Dicer KO mice did not. Bioinformatic analysis of RNA expression profiles identified miR-10a-5p as a potential regulator of inflammation and differentiation in ATMs and ASCs, respectively. CL treatment increased levels of miR-10a-5p in ATMs and ASCs in gWAT. Interestingly, CL treatment elevated levels of pre-mir-10a in ATMs but not in ASCs, suggesting possible transfer from ATMs to ASCs. Elevating miR-10a-5p levels inhibited proinflammatory gene expression in cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages and promoted the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells into brown adipocytes. Furthermore, treatment with a miR-10a-5p mimic in vivo rescued CL-induced beige  in Dicer KO mice. High fat feeding reduced miR-10a-5p levels in ATMs of gWAT, and treatment of mice with a miR-10a-5p mimic suppressed pro-inflammatory responses, promoted the appearance of new white adipocytes in gWAT, and improved systemic glucose tolerance.These results demonstrate an important role of macrophage-generated microRNAs in adipogenic niches and identify miR-10a-5p as a key regulator that reduces adipose tissue inflammation and promotes therapeutic .Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Poultry meat quality is affected by many factors, among which intramuscular fat (IMF) is predominant. IMF content affects tenderness, juiciness and flavour of meat. Krüppel-like transcriptional factors (KLFs) are important regulators of adipocyte differentiation. However, little is known about the  gene associated with poultry IMF deposition, especially intramuscular adipocyte differentiation. 2. Previous work has shown that chicken  was differentially expressed during  of intramuscular preadipocytes differentiation. In this study, the function of  in chicken intramuscular preadipocytes differentiation was investigated. 3. In the chicken preadipocyte differentiation model,  expression showed a major increase with adipogenic induction. Overexpression of  down-regulated the expression of the adipogenic marker gene , and impaired triglyceride accumulation. Knockdown of  in chicken intramuscular preadipocytes increased the expression of  and .

It possesses a wide range of medicinal properties suggesting its potential clinical utility that requires further investigation. The present review intends to highlight the efficacy of kaempferol and its molecular mechanisms of action in regulating bone metabolism. Many reports have acknowledged the bone-protecting property of kaempferol and kaempferol-containing plants using in vitro and in vivo experimental models. Kaempferol supplementation showed bone-sparing effects in newborn rats, glucocorticoid-induced and ovariectomy-induced osteoporotic models as well as bone fracture models. It achieves the bone-protective effects by inhibiting , inflammation, oxidative stress, osteoclastic autophagy and osteoblastic apoptosis while activating osteoblastic autophagy. The anti-osteoporotic effects of kaempferol are mediated through regulation of estrogen receptor, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways. In summary, kaempferol exhibits beneficial effects on skeleton, thus is potentially effective for the prophylaxis and treatment of osteoporosis.© 2019 Wong et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653699>Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) regulates adipocyte differentiation by assembling CRL4B ubiquitin ligase to target PPARγ for proteasomal degradation.</a></h2><p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is the central regulator of , and its dysregulation is linked to obesity and metabolic diseases. Identification of the factors that regulate PPARγ expression and activity is therefore crucial for combating obesity. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor with a known role in xenobiotic detoxification. Recent studies have suggested that AhR also plays essential roles in energy metabolism. However, the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. We previously reported that experiments with adipocyte-specific Cullin 4b (Cul4b)-knockout mice showed that CUL4B suppresses  by targeting PPARγ. Here, using immunoprecipitation, ubiquitination, real-time PCR and Gst-pulldown assays, we report that AhR functions as the substrate receptor in CUL4B-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4B) complex and is required for recruiting PPARγ. AhR overexpression reduced PPARγ stability and suppressed adipocyte differentiation, and AhR knockdown stimulated adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. Furthermore, we found that two lysine sites on residues 268 and 293 in PPARγ are targeted for CRL4B-mediated ubiquitination, indicating cross-talk between acetylation and ubiquitination. Our findings establish a critical role of AhR in regulating PPARγ stability and suggest that the AhR-PPARγ interaction may represent a potential therapeutic target for managing metabolic diseases arising from PPARγ dysfunction.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573081>Brown adipocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells-how far have we come?</a></h2><p>A global increase in the number of individuals who are either overweight or obese is leading to a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Behavioral interventions for the treatment of obesity have yet to deliver desired outcomes, thus introducing a pressing need for molecular- and cellular-based therapies. Excess energy from food is stored in the form of triglycerides in white adipose tissue, which expands during weight gain and can lead to insulin resistance and T2D. By contrast, brown adipose tissue (BAT) releases energy from metabolic substrates in the form of heat and secretes factors that can reverse metabolic disease by acting systemically. Therefore, the ability to increase BAT activity is a promising approach to improve energy balance and metabolic homeostasis. Methods are now being developed to generate brown adipocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which would (1) provide an unlimited source of cellular material to study human brown , and (2) could be used to develop drug- and cell-based therapies for the treatment of metabolic complications associated with obesity. This article reviews basic BAT biology and details the current progress toward developing brown adipocytes from hiPSCs.© 2019 New York Academy of Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584730>Metabolic plasticity mediates differential responses to spring and autumn migrations: Evidence from gene expression patterns in migratory buntings.</a></h2><p>What is the central question of this study? What are the molecular underpinnings of seasonal metabolic plasticity during spring and autumn migrations in songbirds? What is the main finding and its importance? We report differences in mRNA levels of genes involved in the regulation of glucose and fat metabolism between photoinduced non-migratory and migratory states and between the spring and autumn migratory states. Higher expression of genes associated with fat mobilization and energy generation in the spring than in the autumn migration suggests differential activation of the metabolic pathways or alteration in the efficiency of existing functional machinery during annual journeys between nearly fixed destinations.The molecular underpinnings of metabolic plasticity underlying differential responses to spring and autumn migrations are not well understood. We investigated this by examining the differences in mRNA levels of metabolic genes in the liver, muscle and adipose tissues of night-migratory red-headed buntings between photostimulated non-migratory and migratory states and between spring and autumn migratory states. Buntings accumulated more subcutaneous fat and hepatic lipid, had higher body mass, larger adipose cells and higher circulating triglyceride and free fatty acid levels and exhibited more intense Zugunruhe in the spring migratory state than in the autumn migratory state. More importantly, we found differences in the hepatic expression of pdc and pdk genes, indicating a differential acetyl-CoA requirement, and of the mdh and ogdh genes, suggesting differential oxidative phosphorylation between the non-migratory and migratory states and between the spring and autumn migratory states. Differences in fasn, bmal1 and glut1 mRNA levels were consistent with this and suggested seasonal differences in  and/or glucose uptake. Likewise, differences in mRNA levels of genes coding for lipases (atgl and lpl) suggested that adipose triglycerides and free fatty acids serve largely as the metabolic substrate. Furthermore, changes in mRNA levels of genes coding for the fatty acid binding protein (fabp3) and fatty acid translocases (cd36) were consistent with differential fat fuel supply (via circulating free fatty acids) to aerobically exercising flight muscles between the spring and autumn migrations. These results show seasonal adaptation of genetic pathway(s) underlying seasonal metabolic plasticity that seems to mediate differential responses to spring and autumn migrations in latitudinal migratory songbirds.© 2019 The Authors.

This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate the spatial distribution and correlation of adipocytes and mast cells in rat superficial fascia. Panoramic images were obtained from whole-mounted fascia stained by toluidine blue. Adipocytes increased gradually in superficial fascia of growing rats. Abundant mast cells, with the degranulation and exocytosis of abundant secretory granules, appeared in fascia where partially differentiating adipocytes and mature adipocytes occurred. Quantitative histological analysis by variance-mean ratio and Morisita index of dispersion indicated that both mast cells and adipocytes in fascia were distributed individually in cluster, but not random or uniform. Spearman's correlation coefficient revealed that the spatial cluster distributions of mast cells and adipocytes positively correlated with each other and correlated with increased number and size of adipocytes and adipogenic areas in fascia. Morphometry analysis indicated the strong correlation between fascial adipocytes and mast cells during the periods of rat growth. The correlation coefficient increased significantly at 8 weeks compared to 4 weeks, consistent with the increasing trend of the number and size of fascia adipocytes in growing rats. This finding provided the first quantitative histological analysis for the spatial distribution and correlation of fascia adipocytes and mast cells, which could be the histocytological basis for further exploring spatial and functional interactions between fascial mast cells and adipocytes. Also, the present data were informative for the research on physiologies and pathologies of fascia and fascia-related connective tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696159>Inhibition of Hepatotoxicity by a LXR Inverse Agonist in a Model of Alcoholic Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Alcohol abuse is a major cause of liver disease and mortality worldwide and is a significant public health issue. Patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) have severe hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis. Therapies for ALD are very limited and even abstinence from alcohol consumption does not necessarily protect patients from progression of the disease. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of a liver X receptor (LXR) inverse agonist, SR9238, in an animal model of ALD. SR9238 suppresses hepatic , a pathological hallmark of ALD, and we hypothesized that targeting suppression of hepatic metabolic pathways that are activated in ALD may be an effective treatment for the disease. A chronic ethanol diet with or without a final ethanol binge treatment was used to induce ALD in mice. Mice were administered the liver specific LXR inverse agonist SR9238 for 4 weeks after the mice had been maintained on the ethanol diet for 14 days. Mice developed all the hallmarks of advanced ALD demonstrating significant pathophysiology and hepatotoxicity. SR9238 significantly attenuated liver injury and hepatic steatosis and fibrosis was nearly eliminated in SR9238 treated mice. SR9238 treatment reversed the damage associated with chronic ethanol use returning the liver to near normal morphology. These results indicate that inhibiting LXR activity using the inverse agonist has a hepatoprotective effect in rodent models of ALD; thus, this pharmacological approach may be efficacious for treatment of ALD in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535138>EPA and DHA have divergent effects on serum triglycerides and , but similar effects on lipoprotein lipase activity: a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Comparative studies suggest that DHA may have stronger serum triglyceride-lowering effects than EPA; however, the molecular basis for this differential effect remains unexplored in humans. Differential regulation of  and triglyceride clearance are 2 possible mechanisms of action.We compared the effects of EPA and DHA supplementation on serum triglycerides, markers of , and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in adults participating in a double-blind, multiarm, placebo-controlled parallel-group randomized trial.  was assessed with the lipogenic index and compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA).Young, healthy normolipidemic men and women (n = 89; 21.6 ± 0.23 y; mean ± SEM) were randomly allocated into 1 of 3 supplement groups for 12 wk: 1) olive oil, 2) ∼3 g EPA/d, and 3) ∼3 g DHA/d. Omega-3 supplements were provided in triglyceride form. Blood was collected before and after supplementation for the analysis of fatty acids and preheparin LPL activity. Variations in the 13C:12C ratio (δ13C) of palmitate (16:0) and linoleate (18:2n-6) were measured by CSIA.DHA supplementation reduced blood triglycerides (0.85 ± 0.04 mmol/L to 0.65 ± 0.03 mmol/L; P < 0.01), with no change seen with EPA supplementation. DHA supplementation did not change the lipogenic index or δ13C-16:0, whereas EPA supplementation increased the lipogenic index by 11% (P < 0.01) and δ13C-16:0 (P = 0.03) from -23.2 ± 0.2 to -22.8 ± 0.2 milliUrey ± SEM.Reduced triglyceride concentrations after DHA supplementation are associated with increased LPL activity, whereas the null effect of EPA supplementation on blood triglycerides may stem from the concomitant increases in  and LPL activity.

In this study, we demonstrate the use of a newly created fusion gene of exendin-4 and α1-antitrypsin to control obesity and obesity-associated metabolic disorders including insulin resistance, fatty liver and hyperglycemia. The fusion gene encodes a protein with exendin-4 peptide placed at the N-terminus of human α-1 antitrypsin, and is named EAT. Hydrodynamic transfer of the EAT gene to mice prevents high-fat diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance and fatty liver development. In diet-induced obese mice, expression of EAT gene induces weight loss, improves glucose homeostasis, and attenuates hepatic steatosis. In ob/ob mice, EAT gene transfer suppresses body weight gain, maintains metabolic homeostasis, and completely blocks fatty liver development. Six-month overexpression of the EAT fusion gene in healthy mice does not lead to any detectable toxicity. Mechanistic study reveals that the resulting metabolic benefits are achieved by a reduced food take and down-regulation of transcription of pivotal genes responsible for  and lipid droplet formation in the liver and chronic inflammation in visceral fat. These results validate the feasibility of gene therapy in preventing and restoring metabolic homeostasis under diverse pathologic conditions, and provide evidence in support of a new strategy to control obesity and related metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647338>Erratum: "The Role of Dietary Phytoestrogens and the Nuclear Receptor PPARγ in : An  Study".</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514294>Anti-Obesity Effects of the Flower of  in High-Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p> (L.) Batsch is a deciduous fruit tree cultivated worldwide. The flower of  (PPF), commonly called the peach blossom, is currently consumed as a tea for weight loss in East Asia; however, its anti-obesity effects have yet to be demonstrated in vitro or in vivo. Since PPF is rich in phytochemicals with anti-obesity properties, we aimed to investigate the effects of PPF on obesity and its underlying mechanism using a diet-induced obesity model. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed either normal diet, high-fat diet (HFD), or HFD containing 0.2% or 0.6% PPF water extract for 8 weeks. PPF significantly reduced body weight, abdominal fat mass, serum glucose, alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and liver and spleen weights compared to the HFD control group. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that PPF suppressed lipogenic gene expression, including stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and -2 and fatty acid synthase, and up-regulated the fatty acid β-oxidation gene, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, in the liver.

Adipose tissue is now considered as an immune organ, at the crossroads between metabolism and immunity. Thus, this study investigates the effects of adzuki beans on obesity and gut microbiota in high fat diet-induced mice.In this study, adzuki bean hot water extract (AWE) is determined to have the most significant anti-adipogenic effect; it is able to inhibit lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and reduces body weight and adipose tissue weight in a dose-dependent manner. AWE treatment also decreases M1-polarized adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) while inducing M2-polarized ATMs. The number and size of fat vacuoles in liver lesions are significantly reduced, indicating that AWE could ameliorate steatosis in high fat diet-induced mice. The results also demonstrate that AWE-treated groups inhibit  via activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and reduce peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins α expression. Moreover, the studies confirm that AWE decreases obesity through modulating gut microbiota.The results demonstrate that AWE supplementation ameliorates high fat diet-induced obesity and gut microbiota composition and suggests that AWE may have the potential to be developed into a functional food to improve metabolic disorders.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Previous studies concluded that these exchanges are incomplete therefore fatty acid H-enrichment requires correcting.  In mice, we measured the H-enrichment of fatty acid positions 2, 3 and methyl hydrogens from [U-H]glucose to determine H-transfer from glucose to fatty acid via malonyl-CoA, NADPH and acetyl-CoA, respectively.  Positional fatty acid H-enrichments were compared to C-enrichment of the same sites from an equivalent amount of [U-C]glucose provided alongside the [U-H]glucose tracer.                   Transfer of glucose H to fatty acid position 2 and methyl sites was low (H enrichment of 0.06 ± 0.01 and 0.14 ± 0.01 relative to C) indicating extensive exchange at both malonyl- and acetyl-CoA, respectively.  Transfer of glucose H into fatty acid position 3 was more extensive (0.46 ± 0.04 relative to C, p < 10 versus position 2) indicating a more limited exchange of those glucose hydrogens that were transferred via NADPH.  However, mice provided with [U-C]glucose and HO had equivalent H-enrichments of fatty acid positions 2 and 3 suggesting that in this setting, NADPH and body water H had exchanged extensively. This is explained by contributions of substrates other than exogenous glucose to DNL coupled with their extensive H-enrichment from HO prior to DNL.  Under such conditions, H-enrichment of fatty acids from HO do not need correction.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668873>Proteomics-Based Comparative Mapping of the Secretomes of Human Brown and White Adipocytes Reveals EPDR1 as a Novel Batokine.</a></h2><p>Adipokines secreted from white adipose tissue play a role in metabolic crosstalk and homeostasis, whereas the brown adipose secretome is less explored.

Mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a mega protein complex that promotes energy-consuming anabolic processes of protein and nucleic acid synthesis as well  in times of energy and nutrient abundance. However, it is best characterized as the regulator of steps leading to protein synthesis.

Recent studies have examined the impact of mTORC1 on levels and functions of the 26S proteasome, the mega protease complex of the UPS. Here we first briefly review current understanding of the regulation of mTORC1, the UPS, and the 26S proteasome complex.

In humans, miR-455 is present on the human chromosome 9 at locus 9q32 and encoded by the human COL27A1 gene (collagen type XXVII alpha 1 chain). The role of miR-455 has been implicated in various human diseases such as cartilage development, , preeclampsia, and cancers, e.g., colon cancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cancer, oral squamous cancer, skin cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. Recently, our laboratory discovered the biomarker and therapeutic relevance of miR-455-3p in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our global microarray analysis of serum samples from AD patients, mild cognitive individuals (MCI), and healthy subjects unveiled the high level of miR-455-3p in AD patients relative to MCI and healthy controls. Further, validation analysis using different kinds of AD samples such as serum, postmortem brains, AD fibroblasts, AD B-lymphocytes, AD cell lines, AD mouse models, and AD cerebrospinal fluid confirmed the biomarker potential of miR-455-3p. The mechanistic link of miR-455-3p in AD was determined via modulation of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) and amyloid-β (Aβ) levels. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed AβPP as validated target of miR-455-3p. Our study on mouse neuroblastoma cells revealed the protective role of miR-455-3p against Aβ-induced toxicities. We also noticed that miR-455-3p enhances cell survival and lifespan extension. High level of miR-455-3p reduces Aβ toxicity, enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and synaptic activity, and maintains healthy mitochondrial dynamics. Based on these evidences, we cautiously conclude that miR-455-3p is a promising peripheral biomarker and therapeutic candidate for AD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565875>Recent Progress on Branched-Chain Amino Acids in Obesity, Diabetes, and Beyond.</a></h2><p>Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are essential amino acids that are not synthesized in our body; thus, they need to be obtained from food.

The mechanisms by which hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an endogenous gasotransmitter, regulates lipid metabolism remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate if the protective effects of H2S during high glucose (HG)‑induced lipid accumulation in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes may be mediated by AMP‑activated protein kinase (AMPK). Triglyceride (TG) content and the production of H2S were determined using  colorimetric assay kits and H2S synthesis methods. The levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein‑1 and adiponectin were evaluated by ELISA. Total AMPK and phosphorylated AMPK levels were assessed by western blot analysis. HG increased the cellular level of TG and decreased H2S production in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes. The H2S donor, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) protected against the HG‑induced accumulation of TG in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, NaHS suppressed HG‑induced TG accumulation by activating AMPK. Collectively, the findings of the present study suggested that HG induced lipid accumulation in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes, and AMPK activation may underlie the lipid‑lowering effects of H2S.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540940>Cellular Origins of Beige Fat Cells Revisited.</a></h2><p>Activated beige adipocytes have therapeutic potential due to their ability to improve glucose and lipid homeostasis. To date, the origin of beige adipocytes remains enigmatic. Whether beige cells arise through de novo differentiation from resident precursors or through reprogramming of mature white adipocytes has been a topic of intense discussion. Here, we offer our perspective on the natural origin of beige adipocytes in mice. In particular, we revisit recent lineage-tracing studies that shed light on this issue and offer new insight into how environmental housing temperatures early in life influence the mode of beige adipocyte biogenesis upon cold exposure later in life. We suggest a unified model in which beige adipocytes (UCP1 multilocular cells) in rodents initially arise predominantly from progenitors (i.e., de novo beige ) upon the first exposure to cold temperatures and then interconvert between "dormant beige" and "active beige" phenotypes (i.e., beige cell activation) upon subsequent changes in environmental temperature. Importantly, we highlight experimental considerations needed to visualize de novo  versus beige cell activation in mice. A precise understanding of the cellular origins of beige adipocytes emanating in response to physiological and pharmacological stimuli may better inform therapeutic strategies to recruit beige adipocytes in vivo.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664866>LncRNA SNHG16 induces the SREBP2 to promote  and enhance the progression of pancreatic cancer.</a></h2><p> Blocking  could significantly inhibit the progression of pancreatic cancer.

Studies have shown that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has a protective effect against irradiation, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we used a TLR4 knockout (TLR4) mouse irradiation model and found that the white blood cell and platelet counts in the peripheral blood of TLR4 mice recovered slowly after irradiation, with bone marrow hyperplasia and increased mortality. Additionally, we found that the proportion of CD11bGr1 granulocytes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow of TLR4 mice was lower than that of wild-type mice after irradiation. Further, we found that the expression of NADPH Oxidases (NOXs) in the bone marrow was down-regulated after irradiation of TLR4 mice, and administration of the NOXs inhibitor VAS2870 reduced the proportion of CD11bGr1 cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of wild-type mice after irradiation. Irradiation induced severe marrow adipocytes accumulation in TLR4 mice, TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide promoted proliferation and inhibited adipogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells. In summary, our data suggest that TLR4 promotes myeloid hyperplasia by up-regulating the expression of NOXs after irradiation, prohibits marrow adipogensis and increases the tolerance of mice to irradiation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) comprise <0.1% of the tumor bulk and possess high self-renewal, tumor initiating properties, and are responsible for therapeutic resistance, disease recurrence, and tumor metastasis. Hence, it is imperative to understand the metabolic rewiring occurring in CSCs, especially their lipid metabolism, on which there have been recent reports. CSCs rely highly upon lipid metabolism for maintaining their stemness properties and fulfilling their biomass and energy demands, ultimately leading to cancer growth and invasion. Hence, in this review we will shed light on the aberrant lipid metabolism that CSCs exploit to boost their survival, which comprises upregulation in de novo , lipid droplet synthesis, lipid desaturation, and β-oxidation. Furthermore, the metabolic regulators involved in the process, such as key lipogenic enzymes, are also highlighted. Finally, we also summarize the therapeutic strategies targeting the key regulators involved in CSCs' lipid metabolism, which thereby demonstrates the potential to develop powerful and novel therapeutics against the CSC lipid metabolome.

Proinflammatory cytokine concentrations are increased in the early phase of the inflammatory response and during the early lactation period in cows. The aim of this study was to determine if ketoprofen treatment in the first days following parturition would decrease proinflammatory cytokine concentration and their correlation between lipid mobilization, ketogenesis and metabolic parameters in cows. The study was conducted on 30 cows divided into two groups of 15 cows each. The experimental group was treated with 3 mg × kg.bw.-1 ketoprofen for three consecutive days after parturition. The blood samples were collected on the first day of treatment and in the first and second week postpartum and they were analyzed for biochemical parameters such as non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), glucose, cholesterol and total bilirubine and inflammatory parameters such as tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1α (IL-1α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). The results suggested that ketoprofen- treated cows had a significantly lower concentration of TNF-α, IL-1α, IFN-γ, NEFA and BHBA in the first and second postpartum week compared to the control group. Ketoprofen administration increased glucose levels (the first week, p⟨0.05), increased cholesterol levels (the second week, p⟨0.01) and decreased serum total bilirubin levels (second week, p⟨0.01) compared to the control group of cows. A positive correlation was found between TNF-α and NEFA and total bilirubin, significantly more expressed in the control than in experimental group of cows (p⟨0.01) and it was also found between IL-1α and NEFA (p⟨0.01). A negative correlation was found between TNF-α and glucose and cholesterol, significantly more expressed in the control than in experimental group of cows (p⟨0.01). A positive correlation was also found between IL-1α and glucose (p⟨0.01). Ketoprofen given parenterally to Holstein cows immediately after calving could reduce inflammation and decrease the relation between inflammatory response and  and ketogenesis in postpartum cows.Copyright© by the Polish Academy of Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31525260>The homozygous variant c.245G > A/p.G82D in PNPLA2 is associated with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy phenotypic manifestations.</a></h2><p>Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is a familial cardiomyopathy featured by fibrofatty replacement of cardiomyocytes. Responsible genetic factors are not discernible in approximately one-third of ACM probands. To investigate this further, we performed whole genome sequencing in 14 mutation-negative ACM probands who underwent cardiac transplantation, and we identified one ACM proband with a rare homozygous missense variant in PNPLA2 (c.245G > A, p.G82D), a rate-limiting enzyme that hydrolyzes triglycerides into fatty acids and diacylglycerol. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that this missense variant may lead to loss of function and therefore impair lipid catabolism. Genetic screening in this proband's family also inferred that the homozygous variant cosegregated with disease. To validate the pathogenicity of this variant and confirm its association with ACM, we established a knockin mouse model carrying the orthologous human homozygous PNPLA2 variant. Interestingly, mice with the homozygous variant presented with arrhythmias and significant cardiac dysfunction at 12 weeks, whereas heterozygous mice were not affected.

In rodent models of NAFLD, treatment with a surrogate of TVB-2640, a pharmacological inhibitor of FAS (FASi), has been shown to reduce hepatic fat and other biomarkers of DNL. The purpose of this Phase I clinical study was to test the effect of the TVB-2640 in obese men with certain metabolic abnormalities that put them at risk for NAFLD. Twelve subjects (mean±SE, 42±2y, BMI 37.4±1.2 kg/m , glucose 103±2 mg/dL, TG 196±27 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes) underwent 10 days of treatment with TVB-2640 at doses ranging from 50-150 mg/d. Food intake was controlled throughout the study. Hepatic DNL was measured before and after an oral fructose/glucose (F/G) bolus using isotopic labeling with 1- C -acetate IV infusion, followed by measurement of labeled VLDL-palmitate via GC/MS. Substrate oxidation was measured by indirect calorimetry. Across the range of doses, fasting DNL was reduced by up to 90% (P=0.003). Increasing plasma concentrations of TVB-2640 were associated with progressive reductions in the percent of fructose-stimulated peak fractional DNL (R = - 0.749, P=0.0003) and absolute DNL AUC 6h post F/G bolus (R = - 0.409, P=0.025). For all subjects combined, ALT was reduced by 15.8±8.4% (P=0.05). Substrate oxidation was unchanged and safety monitoring revealed that the drug was well tolerated, without an increase in plasma triglycerides. Alopecia occurred in two subjects (reversed after stopping the drug), but otherwise no changes were observed in fasting glucose, insulin, ketones, and renal function. These data support the therapeutic potential of FASi, TVB-2640 in particular, in patients with NAFLD and NASH.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31512194>Propionic acid counteracts the inflammation of human subcutaneous adipose tissue: a new avenue for drug development.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue is a primary site of obesity-induced inflammation, which has been emerging as an important contributor to obesity associated disorders. The factors influencing adipose tissue-induced inflammation and the resulting pathophysiological events remain poorly understood. However, dietary fiber consumptions appear to be protective. Short-chain fatty acids such as propionic acid (PA) are the principal products of the dietary fiber fermentation by microbiota. Therefore, we aim to investigate the influence of PA on inflammation,  and glucose uptake markers from human subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). We showed that the treatment of SAT with PA resulted in a significant downregulation of inflammatory parameters (e.g. TNF-α and IP-10) and macrophage markers (e.g. CD163 and MMP-9). The expression levels of PA receptors (i.e. G protein coupled receptor-41 and -43) in human primary adipocytes were very low in comparison with SAT and macrophages. Upon PA treatment, no anti-inflammatory effect was observed in human adipocytes. PA significantly upregulated the expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), sterol regulatory-element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4), which are associated with  and glucose uptake. We also showed that the observed anti-inflammatory effects of PA on SAT were partly mediated by Gi/o protein coupled receptor. Our data suggests that PA anti-inflammatory effects on SAT are mediated partly via Gi/o proteins, leading to the improved expression of factors associated with  and glucose uptake. These responses appeared to be not mediated by adipocytes; but most probably by macrophages. The current study provides new knowledge, which can be used as a potential new avenue for drug development in preventing obesity-related inflammation and metabolic disorders in future.

Stress is physiological and biological response to maintain homeostasis of body against stressors while severe stress response is an important contributor to various illnesses including metabolic syndrome and brain disorders. We have evaluated the effects of intermittent restraint stress on NAFLD in a HFD-fed mouse model. C57/BL6 mice had free access to a 60% HFD for 8 weeks, with or without intermittent restraint stress (3 h) conducted 3 times a week. HFD administration increased fat accumulation in liver tissues. Unlike the stressed standard diet group, the levels of hepatic total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly ameliorated in the HFD with stress group compared to the HFD alone group. These beneficial results were in accordance with serum levels of liver enzymes (AST, ALT) and hepatic levels of TNF-α and oxidative stress parameters (ROS, NO, and malondialdehyde). The intermittent restraint stress significantly attenuated the HFD-derived alterations in serum insulin levels, hepatic protein kinase B (AKT) activity and gene expression especially related to . This intermittent restraint stress also elevated the serum epinephrine concentration and activated the adrenergic receptor β2 or β 3 in livers or WAT. The activations of energy expenditure markers (UCP1, PGC1α) in brown adipose tissue and the browning of WAT were also observed in the HFD with stress group.

Their role in the reduction of lipid deposits in liver tissue is not unequivocal. CLA contain an equimolar mixture of two isomers of linoleic acid: trans-10,cis-12 CLA and cis-9,trans-11. Only one isomer - trans-10,cis-12 CLA exhibits fat-reducing properties, cis-9,trans-11 CLA does not. The main goal of this study was to determine if CLA isomers affect the activation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) in liver cells and tissue. FoxO1 is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulation of lipid and carbohydrates metabolism. In vitro and in vivo models of our study were HepG2 cells and C57BL/6J mice. Methods used in the study were qPCR - quantification of FoxO1 gene expression, Western blot - posttranslational phosphorylation of FoxO1, Oil Red O (ORO) - lipid staining and ELISA - quantification of apoB100. In both models trans-10,cis-12 CLA diminished FoxO1 gene expression: decrease by 44.1 ± 20.9% SD in the cells and 65.4 ± 29.8% SD in mice. The lowest accumulation of lipids (drop of 37.2 ± 1.7% SD) and the highest increase of apoB100 protein (74 ± 12.8% SD) were detected in the medium of cells cultured with trans-10,cis-12 CLA. Both isomers of linoleic acid have different effects on lipid metabolism. Isomer c9,t11 CLA accelerates , whereas isomer t10,c12 CLA activates secretion of lipids in HepG2 cells. In contrast to the in vitro study, unfortunately this pro-health property of t10,c12 CLA was not confirmed in the in vivo model.

Berberine, a natural isoquinoline alkaloid, has antiobesity properties. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained unclear up to now. In this study, porcine adipocytes were cultured and treated with berberine. Cellular lipid content was measured by Oil Red O staining extraction. The role of an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway was evaluated by the phosphorylation detection of AMPKα protein and knockdown of AMPK alpha1 (Ampka1) gene. Gene expressions were analyzed by Western blot and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results showed that berberine reduced lipid accumulation in porcine adipocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner and increased phosphorylation of AMPKα. Furthermore, berberine significantly downregulated the mRNA expression of related genes to  including peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma 2 (Pparg2), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (Cebpa), Cebp beta (Cebpb), sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (Srebf1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (Acc-1), fatty acid synthase (Fas), fatty acid binding protein 4 (Fabp4), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1). Knockdown of Ampka1 markedly reversed the inhibitory effect of berberine on lipid accumulation and mRNA expression of the above genes except Cebpb in porcine adipocytes. Meanwhile, the protein expression of these adipogenic genes in response to berberine and Ampka1 knockdown paralleled the alterations of their mRNA level. These results suggest that berberine inhibits  in porcine adipocytes via AMPK-dependent and -independent multiple mechanisms, which would provide an important idea for the reduction of porcine body fat, as well as the prevention and treatment of human obesity.© 2019 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674727>Serotonin Prevents Differentiation of Brown Adipocytes by Interfering with Their Clock.</a></h2><p>Serotonin was shown to interfere with the differentiation of brown adipocytes.

Under excess energy conditions, TG is synthesized by acylation of diacylglycerol (DG), whereas TG is broken down into DG and free fatty acid, which provide energy for mitochondrial lipid oxidation when needed. In this regard, DG is not merely an intermediate metabolite for TG metabolism; it also serves as a signaling molecule. DG kinase (DGK) phosphorylates DG to produce phosphatidic acid (PA). Consequently, DGK plays a pivotal role in the control of lipid metabolism and signal transduction pathway. Recently, a report has described that DGKε-knockout (KO) mice show expansion of epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) together with the impairment of glucose clearance after short-term (40 days) high fat diet (HFD) feeding, an early presymptomatic phase of obesity in wild-type animals. Nevertheless, no report describes an investigation of their phenotype under long-term HFD feeding conditions. Remarkably, results obtained during long-term HFD feeding show that WAT mass is decreased significantly and that the blood glucose profile in response to glucose challenge is improved in DGKε-KO mice compared with wild-type, which contrast sharply against the phenotype shown for short-term HFD feeding. Morphological examination reveals that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and clusters of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-positive multilocular brown-like ("beige") adipocyte are induced in DGKε-deficient WAT after long-term HFD feeding, suggesting that beige adipocytes facilitate energy expenditure during prolonged HFD feeding. Administration of celecoxib, a selective inhibitor of COX-2, abolishes the appearance of UCP1-positive beige adipocytes in DGKε-KO mice. These findings suggest that DGKε deficiency promotes visceral WAT remodeling in a COX-2-dependent manner under long-term HFD feeding conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Human decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) and commercially-available bovine tendon collagen (COL) were digested with α-amylase or pepsin to prepare the coatings. Physical characterization demonstrated that α-amylase digestion generated softer, thicker, and more stable coatings, with a fibrous tissue-like ultrastructure that was lost in the pepsin-digested thin films. ASCs cultured on the α-amylase-digested ECM had a more spindle-shaped morphology, and proliferation was significantly enhanced on the α-amylase-digested DAT coatings. Further, the α-amylase-digested DAT provided a more pro-adipogenic microenvironment, based on higher levels of adipogenic gene expression, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) enzyme activity, and perilipin staining. Overall, this study supports α-amylase digestion as a new approach for generating bioactive ECM-derived coatings, and demonstrates tissue-specific bioactivity using adipose-derived ECM to enhance ASC proliferation and adipogenic differentiation.

In the current study, we have recognized lysine demethylase 4A (KDM4A) as a novel epigenetic regulator of osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation. Kdm4a expression was upregulated during osteogenesis and  of primary marrow stromal cells and established stromal ST2 line. Overexpression of wild-type Kdm4a promoted adipogenic differentiation and blocked osteogenic differentiation of the progenitor cells. This effect was largely alleviated when the catalytically dead mutation was made. Conversely, depletion or inactivation of Kdm4a in undifferentiated progenitor cells inhibited the formation of adipocytes and promoted the differentiation of osteoblasts. Mechanism explorations showed that overexpression of Kdm4a upregulated the expression of secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (Sfrp4) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/ebpα). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that KDM4A directly bound the promoters of Sfrp4 and C/ebpα, removed the histone methylation mark H3K9me3, and reduced DNA methylation levels of CpG in promoter regions of C/ebpα and Sfrp4. Furthermore, overexpression of Kdm4a inactivated canonical Wnt signaling. Moreover, activation of canonical Wnt signaling through silencing of Sfrp4 in ST2 attenuated the inhibition of osteogenic differentiation and the enhancement of adipogenic differentiation by KDM4A. These data have identified KDM4A as a novel regulator of osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation and suggest KDM4A inhibition as a potential therapeutic target for treating metabolic disorders such as osteoporosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624706>Three-Dimensional Spheroid Formation of Cryopreserved Human Dental Follicle-Derived Stem Cells Enhances Pluripotency and Osteogenic Induction Properties.</a></h2><p>Enhancement and maintenance of the stemness of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is one of the most important factors contributing to the successful  therapeutic application of these cells. In this regard, three-dimensional (3D) spheroid formation has been developed as reliable method for increasing the pluripotency of MSCs. Moreover, using a new protocol, we have previously shown that dental tissues of extracted wisdom teeth can be effectively cryopreserved for subsequent use as a source of autologous stem cells. The main purpose of this study is to analyze the stemness and  osteogenic differentiation potential of 3D spheroid dental MSCs compared with conventional mono-layer cultured MSCs.In this study, MSC-characterized stem cells were isolated and cultured from long-term cryopreserved dental follicles (hDFSCs), and then 2D hDFSCs were cultured under 3D spheroid-forming conditions using a newly designed microchip dish. The spheroids (3D hDFSCs) thus produced were investigated and characterized with respect to stemness, MSC marker expression, apoptosis, cell cycle analysis, extracellular matrix (ECM) production, and osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation properties.In terms of MSC and senescence markers, spheroid cells showed no difference when compared with 2D hDFSCs; however, 3D hDFSCs were observed to have a higher proportion of cell cycle arrest and a larger number of apoptotic cells. Moreover, spheroids showed substantially increased levels of pluripotency marker (early transcription factors) and ECM protein expression. Compared with 2D hDFSCs, there was also a notable enhancement in the osteogenic induction potential of spheroids, although no differences were observed with respect to  .To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the application of a spheroid culture system for dental follicle-derived stem cells using a microchip dish. Although further studies are needed, including  transplantation, the results obtained in this study indicate that spheroid hDFSCs derived from cryopreserved dental follicle tissues could be used as a valuable source of autologous stem cells for bone tissue regeneration.© The Korean Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Society 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648186>Mechanism of SEMA3G knockdown-mediated attenuation of high-fat diet-induced obesity.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a worldwide health problem. Semaphorins are involved in axonal guidance; however, the role of secretory semaphorin 3G (SEMA3G) in regulating adipocyte differentiation remains unclear. Microarray analysis showed that the SEMA3G gene was upregulated in an in vitro model of . In this study, SEMA3G was highly expressed in the white adipose tissue and liver. Analysis of 3T3-L1 cell and primary mouse preadipocyte differentiation showed that SEMA3G mRNA and protein levels were increased during the middle stage of cell development. In vitro experiments also showed that adipocyte differentiation was promoted by SEMA3G; however, SEMA3G inhibition using a recombinant lentiviral vector expressing a specific small hairpin RNA (shRNA) showed the opposite results. Mice were fed a chow or high-fat diet (HFD); knockdown of SEMA3G was found to inhibit weight gain, reduce fat mass in the tissues, prevent  in the liver tissue, reduce insulin resistance and ameliorate glucose tolerance in HFD mice. Additionally, the effect of SEMA3G on HFD-induced obesity was activated through PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling in the adipose tissue and the AMPK/SREBP-1c pathway in the liver. Moreover, the plasma concentrations of SEMA3G and leptin were measured in 20 obese and 20 non-obese human subjects. Both proteins were increased in obese subjects, who also exhibited a lower level of adiponectin and presented with insulin resistance. In summary, we demonstrated that SEMA3G is an adipokine essential for , , and insulin resistance and is associated with obesity. SEMA3G inhibition may, therefore, be useful for treating diet-induced obesity and its complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678737>3D microtissue-derived human stem cells seeded on electrospun nanocomposites under shear stress: Modulation of gene expression.</a></h2><p>Different microenvironments trigger distinct differentiation of stem cells. Even without chemical supplementation, mechanical stimulation by shear stress may help to induce the desired differentiation. The cell format, such as three-dimensional (3D) microtissues (MTs), MT-derived cells or single cells (SCs), may have a pivotal impact as well. Here, we studied modulation of gene expression in human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) exposed to shear stress and/or after MT formation.Electrospun meshes of poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid and amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles (PLGA/aCaP) at a weight ratio of 60:40 were seeded with human ASCs as MTs or as SCs and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without chemical supplementation. After 2 weeks of static culture, the scaffolds were cultured statically for another 2 weeks or placed in a Bose® bioreactor with a flow rate per area of 0.16 mL cm min. Stiffness of the scaffolds was assessed as a function of time. After 4 weeks, minimum stem cell criteria markers and selected markers of osteogenesis, endothelial cell differentiation,  and chondrogenesis were analysed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, cell distribution within the scaffolds and the allocation of the yes-associated protein (YAP) in the cells were assessed by immunohistochemistry.MTs decayed completely within 2 weeks after seeding on PLGA/aCaP. The osteogenic marker gene alkaline phosphatase and the endothelial cell marker gene CD31 were upregulated in MT-derived ASCs compared with SCs. Shear stress realised by fluid flow perfusion upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 expression in MT-derived ASCs and in SCs. The nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio of YAP expression was doubled under perfusion compared with that under static culture for MT-derived ASCs and SCs.Osteogenic and angiogenic commitments were more pronounced in MT-derived ASCs seeded on bone biomimetic electrospun nanocomposite PLGA/aCaP than in SCs seeded without induction medium. Furthermore, the static culture was superior to the perfusion regimen used here, as shear stress resulted in adipogenic commitment for MT-derived ASCs and SCs, although the YAP nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio indicated higher cell tensions under perfusion, usually associated with preferred osteogenic differentiation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the study, the treatment of HLP on improving hyperlipidemia in rats was explored. Oral administration of HLP at 100 or 200 mg/kg body weight effectively alleviated serum lipid levels and liver histological abnormalities in high-fat-diet rats. HLP regulated abnormal mRNA, -related hormones and inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and interleukin-12) levels. HLP improved the ability of gut microbiota to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs have been found to ameliorate liver lesions. Therefore, HLP alleviated hyperlipidemia by improving the levels of SCFAs to regulate lipid metabolism.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play major roles in regulating BMSC differentiation. This paper explored the role of miRNAs in regulating BMSC differentiation swift fate in age-related osteoporosis.Mice and human BMSC were isolated from bone marrow, whose miR-130a level was measured. The abilities of BMSC differentiate into osteoblast or fat cell under the transfected with agomiR-130a or antagomiR-130a were analysed by the level of ALP, osteocalcin, Runx2, osterix or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorγ (PPARγ), Fabp4. Related mechanism was verified via qT-PCR, Western blotting (WB) and siRNA transfection. Animal phenotype intravenous injection with agomiR-130a or agomiR-NC was explored by Micro-CT, immunochemistry and calcein double-labelling.MiR-130a was dramatically decreased in BMSC of advanced subjects. Overexpression of miR-130a increased osteogenic differentiation of BMSC and attenuated adipogenic differentiation in BMSC, conversely, Inhibition of miR-130a reduced osteogenic differentiation and facilitated lipid droplet formation. Consistently, overexpression of miR-130a in elderly mice dropped off the bone loss. Furthermore, the protein levels of Smad regulatory factors 2 (Smurf2) and PPARγ were regulated by miR-130a with an negative effect through directly combining the 3'UTR of Smurf2 and PPARγ.The results indicated that miR-130a promotes osteoblastic differentiation of BMSC by negatively regulating Smurf2 expression and suppresses adipogenic differentiation of BMSC by targeting the PPARγ, and supply a new target for clinical therapy of age-related bone loss.© 2019 The Authors.

Serum lipids (406 from 18 classes) were quantified using mass spectrometry from baseline samples when iothalamate-based glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was at least 90 mL/min. Affymetrix GeneChip Array was used to measure renal transcript expression. DKD progression was defined as at least 40% decline in GFR during follow-up.RESULTSParticipants had a mean age of 45 ± 9 years and median urine albumin/creatinine ratio of 43 (interquartile range 11-144). The 32 progressors had significantly higher relative abundance of polyunsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) and a lower abundance of C16-C20 acylcarnitines (ACs) (P < 0.001). In a Cox regression model, the main effect terms of unsaturated free fatty acids and phosphatidylethanolamines and the interaction terms of C16-C20 ACs and short-low-double-bond TAGs by categories of albuminuria independently predicted DKD progression. Renal expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-encoding gene (ACACA) correlated with serum diacylglycerols in the glomerular compartment (r = 0.36, and P = 0.006) and with low-double-bond TAGs in the tubulointerstitial compartment (r = 0.52, and P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONCollectively, the findings reveal a previously unrecognized link between lipid markers of impaired mitochondrial β-oxidation and enhanced  and DKD progression in individuals with preserved GFR. Renal acetyl-CoA carboxylase activation accompanies these lipidomic changes and suggests that it may be the underlying mechanism linking lipid abnormalities to DKD progression.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov, .FUNDINGNIH R24DK082841, K08DK106523, R03DK121941, P30DK089503, P30DK081943, and P30DK020572.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678905>Integration of metabolomics and transcriptomics reveals short-chain chlorinated paraffin-induced hepatotoxicity in male Sprague-Dawley rat.</a></h2><p>Short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) used in various industrial applications have been listed as new POPs. Previous studies based on high-dose exposures indicate their hepatotoxicity. However, their mechanisms of toxicity or adverse outcome pathways and health risks remain largely unknown.This study aimed to evaluate metabolic consequences of chronic dietary exposure to SCCPs at low doses and reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatotoxicity of SCCPs.A combination of transcriptomics and metabolomics, together with general pathophysiological tests were performed to assess the hepatic response of male rats exposed to SCCPs.Our results highlight two major modes of action: Inhibition of energy metabolism and activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Exposure to SCCPs suppressed oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and turnover of ATP-ADP-AMP and thus results in deficiencies of amino acids and nucleotides in liver of the rat. Exposure to SCCPs affected expression levels of 13 genes downstream of PPARα that encode proteins associated with metabolism of fatty acids. As a result, peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, microsomal fatty acid ω-oxidation, and  were accelerated.Results of this work strongly support the conclusion that low-dose exposure to SCCPs can result in adverse outcomes in the rat model. Significant SCCP-induced inhibition of energy metabolism occurs at environmentally relevant dosages, which suggests that SCCPs exhibit metabolic toxicity. Interactions of SCCPs with PPARα signaling pathway can explain the disruption of lipids and amino acids metabolism.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Theabrownin is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea. Here, we show that theabrownin alters the gut microbiota in mice and humans, predominantly suppressing microbes associated with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Theabrownin increases the levels of ileal conjugated bile acids (BAs) which, in turn, inhibit the intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling pathway, resulting in increased hepatic production and fecal excretion of BAs, reduced hepatic cholesterol, and decreased . The inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling is accompanied by increased gene expression of enzymes in the alternative BA synthetic pathway, production of hepatic chenodeoxycholic acid, activation of hepatic FXR, and hepatic lipolysis.

We investigated the phenotype of the TMEM127 tumor suppressor gene deficiency in vivo. Whole-body Tmem127 knockout mice have decreased adiposity and maintain insulin sensitivity, low hepatic fat deposition and peripheral glucose clearance after a high-fat diet. Liver-specific and adipose-specific Tmem127 deletion partially overlap global Tmem127 loss: liver Tmem127 promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis and inhibits peripheral glucose uptake, while adipose Tmem127 downregulates  and hepatic glucose production. mTORC2 is activated in TMEM127-deficient hepatocytes suggesting that it interacts with TMEM127 to control insulin sensitivity. Murine hepatic Tmem127 expression is increased in insulin-resistant states and is reversed by diet or the insulin sensitizer pioglitazone. Importantly, human liver TMEM127 expression correlates with steatohepatitis and insulin resistance. Our results suggest that besides tumor suppression activities, TMEM127 is a nutrient-sensing component of glucose/lipid homeostasis and may be a target in insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554925>Over-expression of miR-34c leads to early-life visceral fat accumulation and insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Overweight children and adolescents are at high risk for adult and late life obesity. This report investigates some underlying mechanisms contributing to obesity during early life in an animal model. We generated a strain of transgenic mice, cU2, overexpressing human microRNA 34c, a microRNA functionally implicated in . Male and female cU2 mice exhibit significant weight gain, accompanied by marked increase in abdominal fat mass and metabolic abnormalities, including reduction of both glucose clearance rate and insulin sensitivity, as early as two months of age.  derailment at this early age is suggested by decreased expression of adiponectin, the fat mass and obesity-associated gene, and the adiponectin receptor R1, coupled with a reduction of the brown fat biomarker PAT2 and the  inhibitor SIRT1. Notably, adiponectin is an important adipokine and an essential regulator of glucose and fatty acid homeostasis. cU2 mice may provide a crucial animal model for investigating the role of miR-34c in early onset insulin resistance and visceral fat mass increase, contributing to accelerated body weight gain and metabolic disorders.

Increased adipose energy storage in obesity promote insulin resistance and other metabolic adverse effects. To identify a new link between adipocyte and insulin resistance, we performed targeted metabolite profiling of differentiated adipocytes and studied the association between adipogenic metabolites and insulin resistance. We found a correlation between 2-aminoadipic acid (2-AAA) and adipogenic differentiation. Also, circulatory 2-AAA was positively associated with obesity-related factors (fat mass, fat percent, waist circumference, BMI, BMI z-score, triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR) at baseline and after 2 years in the children cohort study. Of these factors, increased BMI z-score and HOMA-IR were the primary independent factors associated with higher 2-AAA levels, and the baseline 2-AAA level was an indicator of the BMI z-score after 2 years. To validate the relationship between 2-AAA and obesity-related factors, we analyzed changes in 2-AAA levels following obesity intervention programs in two independent studies. In both studies, changes in 2-AAA levels during the intervention period were positively correlated with changes in the BMI z-score and HOMA-IR after adjusting for confounders. Moreover, the 2-AAA levels were increased in cell and mouse models of obesity-related insulin resistance. Excess 2-AAA levels led to impaired insulin signaling in insulin-sensitive cells (liver, skeletal muscle and adipose cells) and caused abnormal gluconeogenesis.

Muscle atrophy occurred and adipogenic gene expression, Perilipin and FABP4 were markedly increased in the hind limb muscle of CKD mice. Results indicated that fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) are the precursor of adipocytes in the muscle of CKD mice. Meanwhile, the content of extracellular matrix protein CCN1 was notably increased in serum of CKD patients with sarcopenic obesity which was also found in muscle and serum of CKD mice.

However, the lack of caspase-10 in mice and limited substrate repertoire restricts the understanding of its physiological functions. Here, we report that ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) is a caspase-10 substrate. Caspase-10 cleaves ACLY at the conserved Asp1026 site under conditions of altered metabolic homeostasis. Cleavage of ACLY abrogates its enzymatic activity and suppresses the generation of acetyl-CoA, which is critical for  and histone acetylation. Thus, caspase-10-mediated ACLY cleavage results in reduced intracellular lipid levels and represses GCN5-mediated histone H3 and H4 acetylation. Furthermore, decline in GCN5 activity alters the epigenetic profile, resulting in downregulation of proliferative and metastatic genes. Thus caspase-10 suppresses ACLY-promoted malignant phenotype.

Some of the identified pathways included glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, steroid hormone biosynthesis, retinol metabolism, and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450. The same DEGs dataset was also analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. IPA identified several pathways including PXR/RXR activation, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, and xenobiotic metabolism signaling. Furthermore, the generated DEGs lists were uploaded into NCATS BioPlanet platform. Some of the identified pathways were related to fatty acid omega oxidation, lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, and .

Osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation were confirmed by the following assays: alkaline phosphatase staining, Nile red Staining, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The ratio of adipocytes to osteocytes for both cases was calculated. To evaluate bone induction , a calcium sulfate/hydroxyapatite cement was prepared in a syringe and then seeded with 10 cells/mL of rat bone marrow stromal cells (rMSCs) and covered with 1 mL of tissue culture media containing 0.1 mg of bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP-7). The construct was injected into the abdominal fat tissue of 10 male Sprague-Dawley rats.  The conversion of osteocytes to adipocytes was 20-fold greater than the reverse conversion, and the area of bone regeneration was 15.7 ± 3.7%, the area of adipose tissue was 65.8 ± 13.1%, and the area of fibrous tissue was 18.3 ± 7.8%.  Adipogenic interconversion and associated bone formation demonstrate the potential of a new therapy for balancing osteogenesis and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630942>Novel anti-obesity peptide (RLLPH) derived from hazelnut (Corylus heterophylla Fisch) protein hydrolysates inhibits  in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by regulating adipogenic transcription factors and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation.</a></h2><p>Hazelnut proteins are an excellent source of bioactive peptides. Our previous study demonstrated that several novel peptides derived from Corylus heterophylla Fisch (C. heterophylla Fisch) have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, we purified and identified anti-obesity peptides from hazelnut protein hydrolysates by chromatography and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Subsequently, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of the synthetic peptide on  in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by Oil Red O staining, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot. The results showed that a novel synthetic pentapeptide, Arg-Leu-Leu-Pro-His (RLLPH), derived from the C3 fraction, attenuated  by downregulating the expression of several mRNAs related to , including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein 2 (aP2), sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR). Moreover, RLLPH upregulated the levels of phosphorylated Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. A stability study revealed that RLLPH was relatively stable during pepsin digestion. These findings suggest that RLLPH has potential anti-obesity effects and may help combat metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Here, we investigated the anti-obesity effect and underlying mechanism of  extract (GPE) enriched in gypenoside L, gypenoside LI, and ginsenoside Rg3 and obtained using a novel extraction method. Five-week-old male C57BL/6N mice were fed a control diet (CD), high-fat diet (HFD), HFD + 100 mg/kg body weight (BW)/day GPE (GPE 100), HFD + 300 mg/kg BW/day GPE (GPE 300), or HFD + 30 mg/kg BW/day Orlistat (Orlistat 30) for 8 weeks. The HFD-fed mice showed significant increases in body weight, fat mass, white adipose tissue, and adipocyte hypertrophy compared to the CD group; but GPE inhibited those increases. GPE reduced serum levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol, without affecting HDL-cholesterol. GPE significantly increased AMPK activation and suppressed  by decreasing the mRNA expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP1c), PPARγ coactivator-1α, fatty acid synthase (FAS), adipocyte protein 2 (AP2), and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and by increasing that of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1) and hormone- sensitive lipase (HSL). This study demonstrated the ameliorative effect of GPE on obesity and elucidated the underlying molecular mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629585>Examining the Potency of Subacromial Bursal Cells as a Potential Augmentation for Rotator Cuff Healing: An In Vitro Study.</a></h2><p>To compare the potency of mesenchymal stem cells between the cells derived from the subacromial bursa to concentrated bone marrow aspirate (cBMA) taken from patients undergoing rotator cuff (RC) repair.Subacromial bursa and cBMA were harvested arthroscopically from 13 patients (age 57.4 ± 5.2 years, mean ± standard deviation) undergoing arthroscopic primary RC repair. Bone marrow was aspirated from the proximal humerus and concentrated using an automated system (Angel System; Arthrex). Subacromial bursa was collected from 2 sites (over the RC tendon and muscle) and digested with collagenase to isolate a single cellular fraction. Proliferation, number of colony-forming units, differentiation potential, and gene expression were compared among the cells derived from each specimen.The cells derived from subacromial bursa showed significantly higher proliferation compared with the cells derived from cBMA after 5, 7, and 10 days (P = .018). Regarding colony-forming units, the subacromial bursa had significantly more colonies than cBMA (P = .002). Subacromial bursal cells over the RC tendon produced significantly more colonies than cells over both the RC muscle and cBMA (P = .033 and P = .028, respectively). Moreover, when compared with cBMA, cells derived from subacromial bursa showed significantly higher differentiation ability and higher gene expression indicative of chondrogenesis, osteogenesis, and .The subacromial bursa is an easily accessible tissue that can be obtained during RC repair, with significant pluripotent stem cell potency for tendon healing. Compared with cBMA taken from the proximal humerus, bursal cells showed significantly increased differentiation ability and gene expression over time.Failed RC repairs have been partly attributed to a poor healing environment. Biologic augmentation of the repair site may help increase healing potential and incorporation of the cuff at the tendon-bone interface.Copyright © 2019.

It possesses biological activity against metabolic diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate effects of AH root water extract (AHR) on  in 3T3-L1 cells and in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. AHR inhibited lipid accumulation during adipocyte differentiation by downregulation of gene expression, such as hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and an adipogenic gene, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Oral administration of AHR significantly suppressed body weight gain, adipose tissue weight, serum leptin levels, and adipocyte cell size in HFD-induced obese mice. Moreover, AHR significantly decreased hepatic mRNA expression levels of cholesterol synthesis genes, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor (SREBP)-2, and low-density lipoprotein receptor, as well as fatty acid synthesis genes, such as SREBP-1c and fatty acid synthase. Serum triglyceride levels were also lowered by AHR, likely as a result of the upregulating gene involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a, in the liver. AHR treatment activated gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, which might have promoted HSL and LPL-medicated lipolysis, thereby reducing white adipose tissue weight. In conclusion, AHR treatment can improve metabolic alterations induced by HFD in mice by modifying expression levels of genes involved in , , and lipolysis in the white adipose tissue and liver.</p></html>
