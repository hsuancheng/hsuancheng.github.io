To validate its feasibility and effectiveness, we employee high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to detect  on grapes. HPLC results suggest that the reduction of  on grapes achieve 73.60% after treated 10 min by PAW prepared 30 min, and the concentration of  decreased significantly (p <  0.05) with the preparation time of PAW. Furthermore, HPLC-MS analysis shows that the reduction effect of  by PAW is dominated by the degradation of . Combined with analyzing the physicochemical properties of PAW, one possible degradation pathway is proposed under the present experimental conditions, mediated by reactive  and nitrogen species. The acidic environment (pH < 3) and high oxidation capacity (ORP > 500 mV) are suggested to be a benefit to the reduction of . Besides, the experimental results regarding color, firmness, sugar, vitamin C, and superoxide dismutase of grapes demonstrate that the PAW treatment will not significantly affect the quality of grapes. In conclusion,  pesticide residues on grapes could be effectively reduced by the PAW strategy and without a significant (p <  0.05) effect on grapes quality.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Silkworm midgut is the major organ for digestion and nutrient absorption, importantly it is also a  against foreign substances and chemical pesticides. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism of oxidative injury in silkworm midgut with  induction. The results showed that the transcription level of oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway genes of midgut under  stress. Digital gene expression (DGE) analysis revealed that 24 electron transport chain (ETC)-related genes were upregulated. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction results indicated that the ETC the genes encoding NADH-CoQ1, Succinic-Q, cyt c reductase-S, cyt c oxidase-S, cytochrome c oxidase polypeptide IV, ATP synthase, and vacuolar H+ ATP synthase were all significantly up-regulated by 1.50-, 1.31-, 1.42-, 1.44-, 1.70-, 2.03- and 1.43-fold, respectively.  induction enhanced the activity of ETC complex in mitochondria, and induced the accumulation of ROS in midgut. These results indicated that trace  enhanced respiration in midgut, and the imbalance between the activity changes of ETC may led to reactive oxygen species accumulation. The ETC of mitochondria may be potential biomarkers of midgut toxicity in B. mori caused by  exposure.© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Some antioxidant enzymes play roles in regulating generation of reactive  species (ROS) by pesticides including  and chlorpyrifos, but relatively little is known about their effects on the silkworm peroxiredoxin family genes. Here, five peroxiredoxin (Prx) genes have been identified in silkworm genome, and Prx genes of silkworm and mammalian homologs have apparent ortholog relationship. Based on the genomic DNA sequence, putative 5'-flanking region of five BmPrxs were obtained and the transcription factor binding sites were predicted. Their expression profiles exposed to different concentrations of  and chlorpyrifos for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h in midgut of silkworm were investigated using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The results showed that five BmPrxs and dual oxidase (BmDUOX) gene were all expressed in midgut of silkworm. After feeding with 0.375 mg/L and 0.75 mg/L , the transcription levels of BmPrx3 and BmPrx5 that can be located in mitochondria reached their peak levels at an early time point (24h). However, the transcription levels of BmPrx4 and BmPrx6 that can be addressed to secrete from the cell and cytosol, respectively, reached their peak levels at a later time point (72 h). Similar to expose to , the transcription levels of BmPrx3 and BmPrx5 that can be located in mitochondria reached their peak levels at an early time point (24 h) under chlorpyrifos stress. However, the transcription levels of BmPrx4 and BmPrx6 that can be addressed to secrete from the cell and cytosol, respectively, reached their peak levels at a later time point (72 h) under chlorpyrifos stress. These results revealed that BmPrxs that can be located in mitochondria were able to protect cells even more efficiently than cytosolic from an oxidative stress caused by OP. In addition, BmDUOX was also induced by phomix and chlorpyrifos. Overall, our results indicate that a complex expression regulation of Prxs that play important roles in maintaining redox equilibrium state of silkworm to reduce oxidative damage caused by pesticide.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Studies have found that these enzymes show peroxidase-like activity and may thus be involved in protecting organisms against reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this work, Apis cerana cerana was used to investigate the molecular mechanisms of P450 family genes in resisting ROS damage. A cytochrome P450 gene was isolated, AccCYP336A1. The open reading frame (ORF) of AccCYP336A1 is 1491bp in length and encodes a predicted protein of 496 amino acids. The obtained amino acid sequence of AccCYP336A1 shared a high sequence identity with homologous proteins and contained the highly conserved features of this protein family. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that AccCYP336A1 was present in some fast developmental stages and had a higher expression in the epidermis than in other tissues. Additionally, the expression levels of AccCYP336A1 were up-regulated by cold (4 °C), heat (42 °C), ultraviolet (UV) radiation, H2O2 and pesticide (thiamethoxam, deltamethrin, methomyl and ) treatments. These results were confirmed by the western blot assays. Furthermore, the recombinant AccCYP336A1 protein acted as an antioxidant that resisted paraquat-induced oxidative stress. Taken together, these results suggest that AccCYP336A1 may play a very significant role in antioxidant defense against ROS damage.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abuse of organophosphorus pesticides in recent years often leads to poisoning of silkworms, which significantly affects sericulture development by reducing silk production. Previous studies have shown that TiO2 NPs can effectively mitigate the damages caused by organophosphorus pesticides in silk glands and nerve tissues. The fat body is an important  detoxification organ of silkworms, but it is unknown whether TiO2 NPs affect pesticide  in fat body. In this study, we characterized the transcription of antioxidant genes and enzyme activity in fat body after TiO2 NPs and  treatments using transcriptome sequencing, real-time PCR, and enzyme activity assay. Transcriptome sequencing detected 10 720, 10 641, 10 403, and 10 489 genes for control group, TiO2 NPs group,  group, and TiO2 NPs+ group, respectively. The TiO2 NPs+ group had 705 genes with significantly differential expression (FDR<0.001), among which the antioxidant genes thioredoxin reductase 1 and glutathione S-transferase omega 3 were significantly upregulated. In  group, the expression levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase delta (GSTd), and thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx) were increased by 1.365 -fold, 1.335 -fold, 1.642 -fold, and 1.765 -fold, respectively. The level changes of SOD, CAT, GSTd, and TPx were validated by real time PCR. The contents of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were increased by 1.598 -fold, 1.946 -fold, and 1.506 -fold, respectively, indicating that TiO2 NPs treatment can relieve -induced oxidative stress. To clarify the mechanism of TiO2 NPs's effect, the transcription levels of P450 gene family were measured for the TiO2 NPs+ group; the expression levels of CYP4M5, CYP6AB4, CYP6A8, and CYP9G3 were elevated by 2.784 -fold, 3.047 -fold, 2.254 -fold, and 4.253 -fold, respectively, suggesting that high expression of P450 family genes can enhance the  of  in the fat body. The results of this study indicated that TiO2 NPs treatment promoted the transcriptional expression of the P450 family genes to improve the fat body's ability to metabolize  and reduce -induced oxidative stress. This may be the main mechanism of TiO2 NPs' mitigation of -induced damages in the fat body.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Poisoning of silkworms by organophosphate pesticides causes tremendous loss to the sericulture. In this study, Solexa sequencing technology was performed to profile the gene expression changes in the midgut of silkworms in response to 24h of  exposure and the impact on detoxification, apoptosis and immune defense were addressed. The results showed that 254 genes displayed at least 2.0-fold changes in expression levels, with 148 genes up-regulated and 106 genes down-regulated. Cytochrome P450 played an important role in detoxification. Histopathology examination and transmission electron microscope revealed swollen mitochondria and disappearance of the cristae of mitochondria, which are the important features in insect apoptotic cells. Cytochrome C release from mitochondria into the cytoplasm was confirmed. In addition, the Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) signal  were all inhibited using qRT-PCR.

However, it is possible that during the  , there is generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and  may produce oxidative stress and neurotoxicity in an intoxicated silkworm. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) pretreatment has been demonstrated to increase antioxidant capacity and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in organisms. This study was, therefore, undertaken to determine -induced oxidative stress and neurotoxicity to determine whether  intoxication alters the antioxidant system and AChE activity in the B. mori larval midgut, and to determine whether TiO2 NPs pretreatment attenuates -induced toxicity. The findings suggested that  exposure decreased survival of B. mori larvae, increased malondialdehyde (MDA), carbonyl and 8-OHdG levels, and ROS accumulation in the midgut. Furthermore,  significantly decreased the activities of AChE, superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and levels of ascorbic acid (AsA), reduced glutathione (GSH), and thiol in the midgut. TiO2 pretreatment, however, could increase AChE activity, and remove ROS via activating SOD, CAT, APX, GR, and GST, and accelerating AsA-GSH cycle, thus attenuated lipid, protein, and DNA peroxidation and improve B. mori larval survival under -induced toxicity. Moreover, this experimental system would help nanomaterials to be applied in the sericulture.© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8591759>Influence of  on testicular and seminal vesicle organs, testosterone and cholinesterase level and its tissue residues in male rats.</a></h1><p>The effect of  (Volaton) at two dosage levels (23 and 46 mg/kg b.wt.) on male reproduction tissues and their residues in rats were studied. The tested doses were given orally to male rats for 60 consecutive days. Sex organs weight analysis, semen picture, testosterone and cholinestrase enzyme (ChE) levels, histochemistry, histopathological changes and mating trials were the criteria used to evaluate the reproductive efficiency of the treated rats. There was a dose-related decrease in the weights of testicles and sperm motility associated with an increase in the percentages of dead and morphologically abnormal spermatozoa of treated rats. A decrease in plasma testosterone levels was observed in the treated groups. Histopathological examination revealed that  caused testicular lesions characterized by moderate to severe degenerative changes of spermatogonial cells and by partial arrest of spermatogenesis. Plasma, brain and testicular ChE levels were reduced in treated rats.  and its oxygen analog concentrations were progressively increased by the time of exposure and represented double fold in liver as compared to that in skeletal muscles and testicles. The histochemical examination of testicles of treated rats showed a marked decreament in the ChE activity in tunica albuginea and sperms. A decrease in this enzyme was also noticed in liver hepatocytes, granular layer of the cerebral cortex and medulla of suprarenal gland.</p></html>
