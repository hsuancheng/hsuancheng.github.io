Several bioactive peptides and hydro lysates from natural sources have now been tested in animal models of human diseases for potential anti-inflammatory effects. Eggshell membrane (ESM) is a well-known natural bioactive material. In this study, we aim to study the anti-inflammatory activity of ESM hydro lysate (AL-) in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, AL- was shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 secretion. In vivo treatment with AL- was shown to reduce dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced weight loss, clinical signs of  and secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 (p < .05). In addition, treatment with AL- also attenuated the severity of intestinal inflammation via down-regulation of IL-10 an anti-inflammatory cytokine. This validates potential benefits of AL- as a novel preventative target molecule for treatment of IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29223833>Valve-sparing repair with intraoperative balloon dilation in tetralogy of Fallot: Midterm results and therapeutic implications.</a></h2><p>The significant morbidity of long-term pulmonary regurgitation (PR) has driven the development of pulmonary valve (PV) sparing repair strategies in patients with tetralogy of Fallot (ToF). We assessed mid-term PV function in patients who underwent primary ToF repair with valve-sparing intraoperative balloon dilation () technique.We evaluated 162 consecutive patients with ToF and pulmonary stenosis (ToF-) who underwent valve-sparing repair with  under 1 year of age.Median age at surgery was 98 days (interquartile range [IQR], 72-126) and median follow-up was 2.5 years (IQR, .6-4.9). Median preoperative PV annulus z score was -2.2 (IQR, -2.5 to -1.8). Twenty-five patients (.4%) required reintervention for residual valvular stenosis. Multivariable analysis demonstrated preoperative annulus z score less than -2.45 (P = .036) and younger age at surgery (P = .001) were independent risk factors for early reintervention for stenosis. Freedom from at least moderate PR was 77%, 61%, and 43% at 1, 3, and 5 years postrepair. Right ventricular dimensions were not significantly different compared with a matched cohort of patients undergoing transannular patch repair at midterm follow-up.Patients with ToF- who undergo valve-sparing repair with  develop progressive PR. Compared with transannular patch repair, the extent of RV dilation at midterm follow-up is not significantly different. Patients younger than 3 months of age and those with an annulus z score less than -2.45 experience higher rates of early reintervention for PV stenosis. In these patient subgroups, alternative strategies should be considered. This study suggests valve-sparing repair with  does not preserve long-term PV function in patients with ToF-.Copyright © 2017 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Detailed clinical phenotypes were determined at enrollment by reviewing the patients' medical charts. Disease activity, medical treatment and data about evolvement of complications or surgical interventions were determined prospectively during the follow-up. Disease course (development f complicated disease phenotype and need for surgery), occurrence of thrombotic events, actual state of disease activity according to clinical, laboratory and endoscopic scores and accurate treatment regime were recorded during the follow-up, (median, 57.4 and 61.6 mo for CD and UC). Sera of IBD patients and 103 healthy controls (HC) were tested on individual anti-β2-Glycoprotein-I (anti-β2-GPI IgA/M/G), anti-cardiolipin (ACA IgA/M/G) and anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (anti-/PT IgA/M/G) antibodies and also anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA IgA/G) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In a subgroup of CD (n = 198) and UC patients (n = 103), obtaining consecutive samples over various arbitrary time-points during the disease course, we evaluated the intraindividual stability of the APLA status. Additionally, we provide an overview of studies, performed so far, in which significance of APLAs in IBD were assessed.Patients with CD had significantly higher prevalence of both ACA (23.4%) and anti-/PT (20.4%) antibodies than UC (4.8%, P < .0001 and 10.2%, P = .004) and HC (2.9%, P < .0001 and .5%, P = NS). No difference was found for the prevalence of anti-β2-GPI between different groups (7.2%-9.7%). In CD, no association was found between APLA and ASCA status of the patients. Occurrence of anti-β2-GPI, ACA and anti-/PT was not different between the group of patients with active vs inactive disease state according to appropriate clinical, laboratory and endoscopic scores in CD as well as in UC patients. All subtypes of anti-β2-GPI and ACA IgM status were found to be very stable over time, in contrast ACA IgG and even more ACA IgA status showed significant intraindividual changes. Changes in antibody status were more remarkable in CD than UC (ACA IgA: 49.9% vs 23.3% and ACA IgG: 21.2% vs 5.8%). Interestingly, 59.1% and 30.1% of CD patients who received anti-TNF therapy showed significant negative to positive changes in ACA IgA and IgG antibody status respectively. APLA status was not associated with the clinical phenotype at diagnosis or during follow-up, medical therapy, or thrombotic events and it was not associated with the probability of developing complicated disease phenotype or surgery in a Kaplan-Meier analysis.The present study demonstrated enhanced formation of APLAs in CD patients. However, presence of different APLAs were not associated with the clinical phenotype or disease course.</p></html>
