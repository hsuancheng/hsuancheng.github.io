However, the underlying mechanisms that improve hyperlipidemia and  steatosis are unclear. This study investigated the effects of Irb on lipid metabolism and hepatic steatosis using the spontaneous type 2 diabetic db/db mouse model. The results demonstrated body and  weight, food consumption, lipid content in serum and  tissue, and  dysfunction as well as hepatic steatosis were increased in db/db mice compared with db/m mice, whereas the increases were reversed by Irb treatment. Moreover, Irb administration resulted in an increase in LC3BII as well as the LC3BII/I ratio through activating PPAR-γ and p-AMPK and inhibiting p-Akt and p-mTOR, thereby inducing autophagy in the db/db mouse . Therefore, our findings suggest that Irb can ameliorate hyperlipidemia and  steatosis by upregulating the expression of PPAR-γ, activating the AMPK/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and inducing  autophagy.Copyright © 2016.

To determine the underlying mechanisms of its action, we established an  model of NAFLD by treating human and mouse hepatocytes with free  acids (FFAs) and angiotensin (Ang) II.  significantly reversed AngII/FFA-induced lipid deposition and mitochondrial dysfunction by restoring ATP production and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and decreasing the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory markers. In addition,  also increased the autophagy flux, in terms of increased numbers of autolysosomes and autophagosomes, and the upregulation and mitochondrial localization of the autophagic proteins Atg5 and LC3BII/I. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and inhibition of the autophagic flux exacerbated mitochondrial dysfunction in the steatotic hepatocytes. Furthermore, AngII upregulated PKC which inhibited AMPK phosphorylation via direct interaction with the AngII receptor AT1-R.  inhibited PKC and activated AMPK and its downstream effector ULK1, thereby inducing autophagy, decreasing lipid deposition, and restoring mitochondrial function. Taken together,  triggers autophagy via the PKC/AMPK/ULK1 axis to ameliorate the pathological changes in the steatotic hepatocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27169259>[Effect of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB), , on urinary markers in hypertensive patients].</a></h2><p>We examined the effect of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB),  (Irb), on urinary markers in hypertensive patients.We evaluated 87 patients in a 12-month prospective study: Group 1) 33 patients who were newly administered Irb (100 mg); Group 2) 33 patients who were switched to Irb ; and Group 3) 21 patients who did not undergo change to pre-existing Irb administration. Height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, clinical parameters, urine protein : creatinine ratio (UPC), and urinary markers (-type  acid binding protein (L-FABP), N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, α1-microglobulin, and β2-microglobulin) were measured at the baseline and at 12, 24, and 48 weeks. We examined changes in the clinical parameters, UPC, and urinary markers from the baseline.A tendency toward hypotension was observed in all groups (group newly administered Irb, group switched to Irb, and group without changes to Irb), but the difference was not statistically significant. Urinary L-FABP concentration (μg/g x Cr) decreased from 13.2 --> 8.9 and13.2 --> 10.2 at 24 and 48 weeks, respectively, after administration (p < 0.01) in the group newly administered Irb, from 19.5 --> 10.1 at 48 weeks after administration (p < 0.01) in the switched group, and from 9.6 --> 8.3, 8.1, and 6.2 (p < 0.01) in the group without changes to Irb. Changes in the Irb-administered groups were readily apparent. UPC decreased in the Irb-administered groups (p < 0.05), but there were no significant differences in the other urinary markers. Changes in urinary L-FABP and UPC were positively correlated in all cases of the Irb-administered groups (r = 0.25-0.57, p < 0.05), but were not positively correlated in the group without changes to Irb administration. The change in UPC was positively correlated with changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in all cases (r = 0.23-0.57, p < 0.05).It was concluded that the urinary L-FABP level, blood pressure, and UPC of hypertensive patients should be managed in daily practice using an ARB, including Irb.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643954>Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists.</a></h2><p>The angiotensin II receptor antagonists, also known as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), are a family of agents that bind to and inhibit the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) and thus inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and its cascade of effects in causing arteriolar contraction and sodium retention. While angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block the cleavage of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, the active peptide that causes a pressor response, the ARBs inhibit its peripheral action. The ARBs reduce blood pressure in animal models as well as in humans. Since their introduction in 1995, these agents have been used widely in the therapy of hypertension and to reduce the complications of hypertensive cardiovascular disease and diabetic nephropathy. The ARBs in clinical use in the United States include eight agents of similar chemical structure and activity, but somewhat different pharmacokinetics: losartan (Cozaar: 1995), valsartan (Diovan: 1996),  (Avapro: 1997), eprosartan (Teveten: 1997), candesartan (Atacand: 1998), telmisartan (Micardis: 1998), olmesartan (Benicar: 2002) and azilsartan (Edarbi: 2011). All of these agents have been associated with a minimal rate of serum enzyme elevations during chronic therapy (0.2% to 2%) which are usually mild-to-moderate in severity, self limited, and rarely require dose modification or discontinuation. As a class, the ARBs have been associated with rare instances of acute  injury that is usually self limited in duration, but varies in clinical expression, being usually hepatocellular but occasional cholestatic in nature. The most common presentation of  injury due to these agents is a cholestatic hepatitis arising within 1 to 8 weeks of starting and resolving as rapidly with stopping. Rare instances of prolonged jaundice have been described but not acute  failure or autoimmune chronic hepatitis. Several Individual case reports of clinically apparent  injury have been published in the literature for losartan, valsartan,  olmesartan and candesartan, but not specifically for azilsartan, eprosartan, and telmisartan, probably because these three have been in use for a shorter period of time and in fewer subjects. Most ARBs and particularly olmesartan have been linked to rare instances of severe sprue-like enteropathy. The enteropathy typically presents with severe diarrhea and weight loss with variable degrees of fatigue, nausea and abdominal discomfort arising 6 months to many years after starting the ARB. Small intestinal histological findings resemble those of celiac disease with flattening of the duodenal villuous pattern and villous atrophy. However, anti-transglutaminase and endomysial antibodies (the serologic markers of celiac disease) are negative and there is little or no response to a gluten-free diet. Withdrawal of the ARB, however, results in prompt improvement in the diarrhea and gradual resolution of duodenal villous flattening. Some cases of this drug induced enteropathy have had accompanying serum aminotransferase elevations and  by imaging or  biopsy, which, along with the diarrhea, resolve rapidly with stopping the medication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28179883>New microRNA Biomarkers for Drug-Induced Steatosis and Their Potential to Predict the Contribution of Drugs to Non-alcoholic  Disease.</a></h2><p> Drug-induced steatosis is a major reason for drug failure in clinical trials and post-marketing withdrawal; and therefore, predictive biomarkers are essential. These could be particularly relevant in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), where most patients show features of the metabolic syndrome and are prescribed with combined chronic therapies, which can contribute to . However, specific biomarkers to assess the contribution of drugs to NAFLD are lacking. We aimed to find microRNAs (miRNAs) responsive to steatotic drugs and to investigate if they could become circulating biomarkers for drug-induced steatosis.  Human HepG2 cells were treated with drugs and changes in miRNA levels were measured by microarray and qRT-PCR. Drug-induced fat accumulation in HepG2 was analyzed by high-content screening and enzymatic methods. miRNA biomarkers were also analyzed in the sera of 44 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients and in 10 controls.  We found a set of 10 miRNAs [miR-22-5p, -3929, -24-2-5p, -663a, -29a-3p, -21 (5p and 3p), -27a-5p, -1260 and -202-3p] that were induced in human HepG2 cells and secreted to the culture medium upon incubation with model steatotic drugs (valproate, doxycycline, cyclosporin A and tamoxifen). Moreover, cell exposure to 17 common drugs for NAFLD patients showed that some of them (e.g., , fenofibrate, and omeprazole) also induced these miRNAs and increased intracellular triglycerides, particularly in combinations. Finally, we found that most of these miRNAs (60%) were detected in human serum, and that NAFLD patients under fibrates showed both induction of these miRNAs and a more severe steatosis grade.  Steatotic drugs induce a common set of hepatic miRNAs that could be used in drug screening during preclinical development. Moreover, most of these miRNAs are serum circulating biomarkers that could become useful in the diagnosis of iatrogenic steatosis.</p></html>
