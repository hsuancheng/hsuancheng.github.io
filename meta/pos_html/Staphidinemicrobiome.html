The results showed that the  decrease rates of BBP, BBP-8, BBP-16, and BBP-24 were 77.48, 69.61, 56.87, and 52.89%, respectively. The antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of BBPs were decreased under gastrointestinal condition, which might be due to the variation of  during digestion. The bile acid-binding ability of BBPs showed an -dependent manner for higher  polysaccharides with higher viscosity. Through fermentation, the BBPs affected the ecosystem of the intestinal tract by promoting the production of short-chain fatty acids, lowering the pH of colon, and decreasing the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. All BBPs showed almost a similar modulation effect on the gut bacteria, but the lower  polysaccharide was more easily utilized by bacteria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667426>Oregano: A potential prophylactic treatment for the intestinal .</a></h1><p>Prophylactic use of antibiotics in poultry diets has been identified as a problematic practice because of its potential to exacerbate the spread of antibiotic resistance to human pathogens. A range of countries have opted to completely ban the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The animal production industries are looking for alternative ways to effectively control pathogens while providing the performance benefits previously secured by antibiotics in feed. Here, we present evidence that oregano () could be a potential alternative for pathogen control in the poultry industry. Broiler diets were supplemented with oregano powder (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2%) for six weeks. The capacity for pathogen control was estimated by  profiling of the jejunum, ileum, and caecum content, and in the faeces, by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The concentrations of short-chain fatty acids in the caecal content were also measured, as were villus/crypt parameters in the ileum. There were no differences among treatments in weight gain, feed intake, or the concentration of short-chain fatty acids. The height, width, and the surface area of villi in the ileum were not influenced by oregano addition. However, 1% and 2% of oregano produced a significant increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio. There were no visible histopathological changes in the liver in control and treated groups. Although oregano had no significant effect on overall microbial diversity and gross composition, some specific genera, like ,  and , which include known pathogens, were reduced in relative abundance by oregano treatment. , recognized as a beneficial and probiotic genus, was also suppressed by the oregano treatment.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681174>Effect of Metformin on Short-Term High-Fat Diet-Induced Weight Gain and Anxiety-Like Behavior and the Gut .</a></h1><p>The pathogenic factors of the complex epidemic disorder-obesity, have expanded from genetic background, endocrine factors, abnormal feeding behaviors, and direct neural control of adipose tissue physiology. As a chronic metabolic disease, it is important to find new potential therapeutic targets and locate a sensitive time window for intervention. In this study, we focus on the early stage of a high-fat diet mouse model: a short-term 3-week treatment. Our results showed that this short-term 3-week HFD can already induce significant body weight gain, increased adipocyte size and surprisingly, anxiety-like behavior of the animals. Then we tried the early intervention with metformin, already reported for its effects in long-term HFD induced obesity. For a short-term 3-week co-treatment, metformin alleviated the HFD-induced increase in body weight, the increase in adipocyte size and furthermore, the anxiety-like behavior. Differences were noted among the normal diet (ND), HFD, and HFD with metformin co-treatment groups in gut , including its composition and diversity. The possible involvement of gut  cannot be ruled out. Intense phospho-AMPK staining was found in the metformin treatment group in the habenular nuclei, hippocampus and basal ganglia of the brain compared with the HFD group, implying that the anxiolytic effect of metformin could be due to the direct activation of the AMPK pathway in the anxiety-related brain nuclei.Copyright © 2019 Ji, Wang and Li.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664852>Mice without a  are partially protected from lung injury by hyperoxia.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671720>The Human Milk  is Modulated by Maternal Diet.</a></h1><p>Human milk microorganisms contribute not only to the healthy development of the immune system in infants, but also in shaping the gut .

A total of 342, 26-d-old Cobb500 broilers were divided into 5 groups with 6 replicates. Treatments were as follows: (a) Low stocking density (L, 9 birds per cage); (b) High stocking density (H, 12 birds per cage); (c) H + 50 ppm NAM; (d) H + 500 ppm BA; (e) H + 50 ppm NAM + 500 ppm BA (COMB). The results showed that high stocking density significantly reduced the feed intake and body weight gain of broilers, while COMB improved the growth performance at high stocking density. High stocking density significantly reduced the liver metallothionein content, liver mitochondrial membrane potential and the activities of Na+K+-ATPase and Ca2+Mg2+-ATPase. In contrast, the liver metallothionein contents in the NAM, BA and COMB fed group were higher than those in the H group. COMB increased the activity of ATPase as well, but it failed to enhance the mitochondrial membrane potential. Stocking density also affected gut  of broilers. The high-density group increased the relative abundance of Blautia. Supplementation of BA and NAM increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria, respectively. In conclusion, a combination of NAM and BA can improve the performance, antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial function and intestinal  of broilers at high stocking density.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666328>Quantifying the impact of treatment history on plasmid-mediated resistance evolution in human gut .</a></h1><p>To understand how antibiotic use affects the risk of a resistant infection, we present a computational model of the population dynamics of gut  including antibiotic resistance-conferring plasmids. We then describe how this model is parameterized based on published  data. Finally, we investigate how treatment history affects the prevalence of resistance among opportunistic enterobacterial pathogens. We simulate treatment histories and identify which properties of prior antibiotic exposure are most influential in determining the prevalence of resistance. We find that resistance prevalence can be predicted by 3 properties, namely the total days of drug exposure, the duration of the drug-free period after last treatment, and the center of mass of the treatment pattern. Overall this work provides a framework for capturing the role of the  in the selection of antibiotic resistance and highlights the role of treatment history for the prevalence of resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665423>Identification of Metagenomics Structure and Function Associated With Temporal Changes in Rat (Rattus norvegicus) Skin  During Health and Cutaneous Burn.</a></h1><p>The cutaneous skin  is host to a vast ensemble of resident microbes that provide essential capabilities including protection of skin barrier integrity and modulation of the host immune response. Cutaneous burn-injury promotes alteration of cutaneous and systemic immune response that can affect both commensal and pathogenic microbes. A cross-sectional study of a limited number of burn patients revealed a difference in the bacteriome of burned versus control participants. Temporal changes of the skin  during health and cutaneous burn-injury remains largely unknown. Furthermore, how this microbial shift relates to community function in the collective metagenome remain elusive. Due to cost considerations and reduced healing time, rodents are frequently used in burn research, despite inherent physiological differences between rodents and human skin. Using a rat burn model, a longitudinal study was conducted to characterize the rat skin bacterial residents and associated community functions in states of health (n = 30) (sham-burned) and when compromised by burn-injury (n = 24). To address the knowledge gap, traumatic thermal injury and disruption of cutaneous surface is associated with genus-level changes in the , reduced bacterial richness, and altered representation of bacterial genes and associated predicted functions across different skin microbial communities. These findings demonstrate that, upon burn-injury, there is a shift in diversity of the skin's organismal assemblages, yielding a core  that is distinct at the genome and functional level. Moreover, deviations from the core community correlate with temporal changes post-injury and community transition from the state of cutaneous health to disease (burn-injury).© The Author(s) 2019.

Although the  seems to be linked to all sorts of diseases, cancer has the biggest potential to be investigated. Following the publication of the National Institute of Health - Human  Project (NIH-HMP), the link between Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) and  seems to be a fast-moving field in research area. However, robust evidence-based literature is still quite scarce. Nevertheless the relationship between oral  and HNC could have important consequences for prevention and early detection of this type of tumors. The aims of the present review are: (i) to discuss current pre-clinical evidence of a role of oral  in HNC; (ii) to report recent developments in understanding the human 's relationship with HNC oncogenesis; (iii) to explore the issue of treatment response and treatment toxicity; (iv) to describe the role of  as potentially modifiable factor suitable for targeting by therapeutics. Further studies are needed to better establish the causal relationship between oral  and HNC oncogenesis. Future trials should continue to explore oral  in order to build the scientific and clinical rationale of HNC preventative and ameliorate treatment outcome.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies indicated that several factors related to host response have a crucial role in pulpitis. Among these factors, inflammatory mediators of the immune system such as cytokines and chemokines contribute to pulpal defense mechanisms. A wide range of cytokines have been observed in dental pulp and these small molecules are able to trigger inflammation and participate in immune cell trafficking, cell proliferation, inflammation, and tissue damage in pulp space. Therefore, the aim of this review was to describe the role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of pulpitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study provides a comprehensive culture-independent  analysis from the sap of grapevine overtime and in a context of a vascular disease. The vascular system plays a key role by transporting nutrient, water and signals throughout the plant. The negative pressure in the xylem conduits, and low oxygen and nutrient content of its sap make it a unique and underexplored microbial environment. We hypothesized that grapevine hosts in its sap, microbes that have a beneficial impact on plant health by protecting against pathogen attack and supporting key biological processes. To address this hypothesis, we chose a vineyard under high Pierce's disease (PD). PD is caused by the xylem-dwelling pathogenic bacterium . We selected ten grapevines within this vineyard with a range of disease phenotypes, and monitored them over 2 growing seasons. We sampled each vines at key phenological stages (bloom, veraison, and post-harvest) and used an amplicon metagenomics approach to profile the bacterial (16S -V4) and fungal (ITS) communities of the sap. We identified a core  of the sap composed of seven bacterial ( and ) and five fungal (, and ) taxa that were present throughout the growing season. Overall, the sap microbial makeup collected from canes was more similar to the root microbial profile. Alpha diversity metrics indicated a microbial enrichment at bloom and in vines with moderate PD severity suggesting a host-driven microbial response to environmental cues. Beta diversity metrics demonstrated that disease condition and plant phenology impacted microbial community profiles. Our study identified several potential taxonomic targets with antimicrobial and plant growth promoting capabilities that inhabit the grapevine sap and that should be further tested as potential biological control or biofertilizer agents.Copyright © 2019 Deyett and Rolshausen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679194>TAOK3, a Regulator of LCK-SHP-1 Crosstalk during TCR Signaling.</a></h1><p>Signaling from the T cell receptor for antigen turns on the physiological response of a T cell. The canonical TCR signaling pathway relies on early activation of the Src kinase LCK. This step initiates a cascade of events that lead not only to the phenotypic changes that characterize effector T cells but also to the activation of negative regulatory mechanisms that stop early TCR signaling. These mechanisms ensure qualitative and quantitative fine-tuning of T cell activation. The tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 is a key player in the downregulation of LCK activation. In this review, we focus on the crosstalk between LCK and SHP-1 and, based on recent data, we introduce the putative kinase TAOK3 as an important regulator of this crosstalk. Given the widespread expression of TAOK3 and SHP-1, we propose that the function of TAOK3 extends beyond T cells and may be fundamental in the regulation of early signaling from receptors that utilize Src kinases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670167>Reduction in pathogenic load of wheat by tempering with saline organic acid solutions at different seasonal temperatures.</a></h1><p>As a raw agricultural commodity, wheat is exposed to microbial contamination; therefore, enteric pathogens may be among its  creating a food safety risk in milled products. This research evaluates (1) the effectiveness of organic acids dissolved in saline solutions to reduce the counts of pathogenic microorganisms in soft and hard wheat, and also investigates the effect of seasonal temperature on (2) survivability of pathogens in wheat kernels and on (3) pathogen inactivation during tempering with saline organic acid solutions. Wheat samples were inoculated with cocktails of either 5 serovars of Salmonella enterica, 5 E. coli O157:H7 or 6 non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strains to achieve a concentration of ~7 log CFU/g. Inoculated samples were allowed to stand for 7-days at temperatures (2.0, 10.8, 24.2, 32 °C) corresponding to those experienced during winter, spring/fall, and summer (average and maximum) in the main wheat growing regions in the state of Nebraska, USA. Besides water, solutions containing acid (acetic or lactic 2.5% or 5.0% v/v) and NaCl (~26% w/v) were used for tempering the wheat to 15.0% (soft) and 15.5% (hard) moisture at the different seasonal temperatures. The survival of pathogenic microorganisms throughout the resting period, and before and after tempering was analyzed by plating samples on injury-recovery media. The survival rate of pathogenic microorganisms on wheat kernels was higher at temperatures experienced during the winter (2.0 °C) and spring/fall (10.8 °C) months. Regardless of tempering temperature, the initial pathogen load was reduced significantly by all solutions when compared to the control tempered with water (P ≤ .05). The combination of lactic acid (5.0%) and NaCl was the most effective treatment against Salmonella enterica, E. coli O157:H7 and non-O157 STEC, with average reduction values of 1.8, 1.8 and 1.6 log CFU/g for soft wheat and 2.6, 2.4 and 2.4 log CFU/g for hard wheat, respectively. Implementation of organic acids and NaCl in tempering water may have the potential to reduce the risk of pathogen contamination in milled products.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

With the growing interest of the use of mastic oil in the food and pharmaceutical industry, systematic in vivo studies are needed to address controlled usage and safety issues. In the present work we evaluated the safety of mastic oil using as a model the zebrafish lateral line system. In addition, we studied the gene expression profile of zebrafish fed with mastic oil-supplemented diet using microarray analysis. Our results showed that the hair cells of lateral line neuromasts are functional upon exposure of zebrafish larvae up to 20 ppm of mastic essential oil, while treatment with higher concentrations, 100 and 200 ppm, resulted in increased larvae mortality. Dietary supplementation of zebrafish with mastic essential oil led to differential expression of interferon response-related genes as well as the immune responsive gene 1 () that links cellular metabolism with immune defense. Notably, , a constituent of the mucus hydrogel that protects the host against invading pathogens, was up-regulated. Our in vivo work provides information concerning the safety of mastic essential oil use and suggests dietary effects on gene expression related with the physical and immunochemical properties of the gastrointestinal system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666129>A conceptual framework for the phylogenetically constrained assembly of microbial communities.</a></h1><p>Microbial communities play essential and preponderant roles in all ecosystems. Understanding the rules that govern microbial community assembly will have a major impact on our ability to manage microbial ecosystems, positively impacting, for instance, human health and agriculture. Here, I present a phylogenetically constrained community assembly principle grounded on the well-supported facts that deterministic processes have a significant impact on microbial community assembly, that microbial communities show significant phylogenetic signal, and that microbial traits and ecological coherence are, to some extent, phylogenetically conserved. From these facts, I derive a few predictions which form the basis of the framework. Chief among them is the existence, within most microbial ecosystems, of phylogenetic core groups (PCGs), defined as discrete portions of the phylogeny of varying depth present in all instances of the given ecosystem, and related to specific niches whose occupancy requires a specific phylogenetically conserved set of traits. The predictions are supported by the recent literature, as well as by dedicated analyses. Integrating the effect of ecosystem patchiness, microbial social interactions, and scale sampling pitfalls takes us to a comprehensive community assembly model that recapitulates the characteristics most commonly observed in microbial communities. PCGs' identification is relatively straightforward using high-throughput 16S amplicon sequencing, and subsequent bioinformatic analysis of their phylogeny, estimated core pan-genome, and intra-group co-occurrence should provide valuable information on their ecophysiology and niche characteristics. Such a priori information for a significant portion of the community could be used to prime complementing analyses, boosting their usefulness. Thus, the use of the proposed framework could represent a leap forward in our understanding of microbial community assembly and function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667223>Experimental data from flesh quality assessment and shelf life monitoring of high pressure processed European sea bass () fillets.</a></h1><p>Fresh fish are highly perishable food products and their short shelf-life limits their commercial exploitation and leads to waste, which has a negative impact on aquaculture sustainability. New non-thermal food processing methods, such as high pressure (HP) processing, prolong shelf-life while assuring high food quality.

Understanding the intestinal ecosystem and its dynamic interaction with diet and dietary supplements currently requires the use of experimental animals with consequent welfare and financial constraints. Here, we describe the development and assessment, using multiple analytical platforms, of a three vessel, continuous flow,  model of the equine hindgut. After inoculation of the model with fresh horse feces, the bacterial communities established in each vessel had similar taxonomic distribution to that of the source animal. Short chain and branched chain fatty acid (SCFA/BCFA) production within the model at steady-state was consistent with expected bacterial function although higher concentrations of some SCFA/BCFAs, were apparent relative to that of  gut content. We demonstrate inter-model repeatability and the ability of the model to capture some aspects of individual variation in bacterial community profiles. This proof-of-concept study, including recognition of model limitations, supports its future development as a tool for investigating the impact of disease, nutrition, dietary supplementation and medication on the equine intestinal . The equine gut model that we have developed and described has the potential to facilitate the exploration of how the equine gut  is affected by diet, disease and medication.

Accordingly, we hypothesized that the  in saliva is associated with the development of autoreactivity and in some cases the progression in health status from benign to overt clinical disease including Sjögren's syndrome (SS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The study comprised a clinical spectrum of anti-Ro+ mothers, all of whom gave birth to a child with NL: 9 were asymptomatic or had an undifferentiated autoimmune disease (Asym/UAS) and 16 fulfilled criteria for SS and/or SLE. Microbial diversity was reduced across all levels from kingdom to species for the anti-Ro+ mothers vs healthy controls; however, there were no significant differences between Asym/UAS and SS/SLE mothers. Relative abundance of Proteobacteria and more specifically class Betaproteobacteria decreased with clinical severity (healthy controls < Asym/UAS < SS/SLE).

Recent findings have implicated microbially derived mediators as potential signals between the gut  and host circadian clocks; two specific mediators are discussed in this review: short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids (BAs).

Extrinsic factors such as diet and host immunity are insufficient to explain the constituents of this community, and direct interactions between co-resident microorganisms have been implicated as important drivers of  composition. The genomes of bacteria derived from the gut  contain several pathways that mediate contact-dependent interbacterial antagonism. Many members of the Gram-negative order Bacteroidales encode the type VI secretion system (T6SS), which facilitates the delivery of toxic effector proteins into adjacent cells. Here we report the occurrence of acquired interbacterial defence (AID) gene clusters in Bacteroidales species that reside within the human gut . These clusters encode arrays of immunity genes that protect against T6SS-mediated intra- and inter-species bacterial antagonism. Moreover, the clusters reside on mobile elements, and we show that their transfer is sufficient to confer resistance to toxins in vitro and in gnotobiotic mice. Finally, we identify and validate the protective capability of a recombinase-associated AID subtype (rAID-1) that is present broadly in Bacteroidales genomes. These rAID-1 gene clusters have a structure suggestive of active gene acquisition and include predicted immunity factors of toxins derived from diverse organisms. Our data suggest that neutralization of contact-dependent interbacterial antagonism by AID systems helps to shape human gut  ecology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668878>Polyphasic characterization of two novel Lactobacillus spp. isolated from blown salami packages: Description of Lactobacillus halodurans sp. nov. and Lactobacillus salsicarnum sp. nov.</a></h1><p> analysis of blown pack spoiled salami revealed five distinguishable Lactobacillus isolates we could not assign to a known species.

All isolates are Gram-stain positive, facultative anaerobic, catalase and oxidase negative, non-motile and non-sporulating. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA, dnaK, pheS and rpoA gene sequences revealed two distinct lineages within the genus Lactobacillus (L.). The isolates are members of the Lactobacillus alimentarius group with Lactobacillus ginsenosidimutans DSM 24154 (99.4% 16S similarity), Lactobacillus versmoldensis DSM 14857 (97.9%) and Lactobacillus furfuricola DSM 27174 (97.7%) as phylogenetic closest related species and L. alimentarius DSM 20249 (97.7%) and Lactobacillus paralimentarius DSM 13961 (97.5%) as closest relatives, respectively.

Different sites of colorectal cancer (CRC) are different in many aspects, including clinical symptoms, biological behaviour, and prognosis.This study aimed to analyse prognosis, genes, bacteria, fungi, and microbial metabolome in different sites of CRC.The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and STAT were used to statistically describe and analyse the prognosis in different sites of CRC. RNA sequences of CRC from Broad Institute's GDAC Firehose were re-annotated and reanalysed based on different sites using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyse the prognosis and Cytoscape was used to construct a drug-target network based on DGIdb databases. Bacterial 16S V3-V4 and fungal ITS V3-V4 ribosomal RNA genes of stool samples were sequenced. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GS/MS) was performed to detect the microbial metabolites in stool samples. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to compare distinct gut microorganisms and microbial metabolites between rectal and sigmoid cancers.The prognosis in CRC with different sites is significantly different. The closer to the anus predicted longer survival time. The difference between genes and co-expression pairs in CRC with different sites were constructed. The relative abundance of 112 mRNAs and 26 lncRNAs correlated with the sites of CRC were listed. Nine differentially expressed genes at different sites of CRC were correlated with prognosis. A drug-gene interaction network contained 227 drug-gene pairs were built. The relative abundance of gut bacteria and gut fungus, and the content of microbe-related metabolites were statistically different between rectal and sigmoid cancers.There are many differences in prognosis, genome, drug targets, gut , and microbial metabolome in different colorectal cancer sites. These findings may improve our understanding of the role of the CRC sites in personalized and precision medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680254>Temperature and pH growth profile prediction of newly isolated bacterial strains from alkaline soils.</a></h1><p>The soil microorganisms can form complex and varied communities which interact with each other in many different ways depend to environment conditions. These microbial diversities are accompanied by different metabolic paths and adaptability reflected even in extreme environments. In the recent decades, biodiversity of microbes in extreme environments has been in scientific focus because the specifically adapted bacteria can improve bioremediation processes in industrial and agriculture application. Instead of time-consuming process of identification of new bacterial strains from habitats rich in , artificial neural network was proposed as a mapping model for resolving the problem of prediction of microbial behaviour.In this article, the occurrence and diversity of alkaliphilic sporogenic bacteria in alkaline soils were investigated. For this purpose, soil samples were collected from different locations: leached soil from the Danube river, cement factory wastewater accumulation, deposit of limestone near the Bešenovo lake and the Beli Majdan cave in the Fruška gora mountain. According to the obtained results, two empirical models were developed that gave a good fit to experimental data and was able to predict the pH and temperature growth profile of the natural isolates successfully. The artificial neural network models showed a reasonably good predictive capability (overall R for temperature growth profile was 0.727, while the overall R for pH growth profile was 0.906).The developed mathematical models provided adequate precision for practical study in the microbiology laboratory and scale-up processes for wide range of laboratory and industrial applications, where specifically-adapted microbial community is needed.

Novel disease biomarkers and curative treatment options are strongly needed.To apply untargeted metabolomic profiling to identify pathogenic mechanisms and candidate disease biomarkers in FA.Mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomic profiling was performed on serum samples of children with either FA alone, asthma alone or both FA and asthma as well as healthy pediatric controls.In this pilot study FA subjects exhibited a disease-specific metabolomic signature as compared to both control subjects and asthmatics. In particular, FA was uniquely associated with a marked decrease in sphingolipids, as well as a number of other lipid metabolites, in the face of normal frequencies of circulating natural killer T (NKT) cells. Specific comparison of FA and asthmatic subjects revealed differences in the -sensitive aromatic amino acid and secondary bile acid metabolism. Children with both FA and asthma exhibited a metabolomic profile that aligned with that of FA alone but not asthma. Among children with FA, history of severe systemic reactions and presence of multiple FA were associated with changes in tryptophan metabolites, eicosanoids, plasmalogens, and fatty acids.Children with FA display a disease-specific metabolomic profile that is informative of disease mechanisms and severity, and which dominates in the presence of asthma. Lower levels of sphingolipids and ceramides and other metabolomic alterations observed in FA children may reflect the interplay between an altered  and immune cell subsets in the gut.Copyright © 2019.

It is usually diagnosed clinically by direct detection of an abnormal pattern of the intestinal . The intermediate diagnosis based on determining the content of microflora metabolites, considered as chemical markers of this disorder, is still rarely used. This is, among others, due to the variety of properties of compounds recognised as dysbiosis markers and as a consequence, the use of different methods for their analysis. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no analytical procedure that would allow unambiguous determination of all compounds in one procedure. In the present study, we have established a detailed method for the quantitative analysis of hydrocinnamic, citramalic, p-hydroxybenzeneacetic, tartaric, hippuric, 4-hydroxybenzoic, indoxylsulfuric, tricarballylic, 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic and benzoic acids along with DL-arabitol that employs the direct derivatization of compounds in a small volume of urine sample followed by gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). To show that the optimised method is a useful tool for chemical diagnosis of dysbiosis, it was applied for determination of the dysbiosis markers in the authentic urine samples.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of A.muciniphila on Porphyromonas gingivalis elicited inflammation.In lean and obese mice, A.muciniphila was administered in P.gingivalis induced calvarial abcess and in experimental periodontitis model (EIP). Bone destruction and inflammation were evaluated by histomorphometric analysis. In vitro, A.muciniphila was co-cultured with P.gingivalis, growth and virulence factors expression were evaluated. Bone-marrow macrophages (BMMϕ) and gingival epithelial cells (TIGK) were exposed to both bacterial strains and the expression of inflammatory mediators, as well as tight junction markers was analyzed.In a model of calvarial infection, A.muciniphila decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and bone destruction. In EIP, treatment with A.muciniphila resulted in a decreased alveolar bone loss. In vitro, the addition of A.muciniphila to P.gingivalis infected BMMϕ increased anti-inflammatory IL-10 and decreased IL-12. Additionally, A.muciniphila exposure increases the expression of junctional integrity markers such as integrin-β1, E-cadherin and ZO-1 in TIGK cells. A.muciniphila co-culture with P.gingivalis reduced gingipains mRNA expression.This study demonstrated the protective effects of A.muciniphila administration and may open consideration to its use as an adjunctive therapeutic agent to periodontal treatment.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Different strategies including phytase supplementation and more recently lactic acid (LA) are used to enhance the P availability from cereals in pig diets; however, their impact on the gut  has been rarely related to fecal shedding of opportunistic pathogens. The present study investigated the effect of phytase supplementation and the treatment of dietary cereals with 2.5% LA on the fecal  composition of metabolic active bacteria and expression of virulence factor genes of enterotoxigenic  and  in growing pigs. Phytase supplementation reduced the fecal abundance of the most abundant  family, whereas the LA-treatment of cereals had a stronger impact on the bacterial community, reducing amylolytic, pullulanolytic and hemicellulolytic ,  and  as well as the fecal bacterial species richness (Chao1) and diversity (Shannon index). Mainly the family  benefited from the decline in the aforementioned families, being enriched by both dietary treatments. Multigroup data integration using sparse partial least squares-discriminant analysis showed that among the most discriminative operational taxonomic units (OTU) especially two unclassified -OTUs, one -like OTU and one OTU within the  group were associated with calcium and P levels but were negatively linked with complex carbohydrates in feces. Heat-stable toxin A () of enterotoxigenic  and  of Shiga-toxin producing  were expressed in feces but were similar among feeding groups. Without modifying the total bacterial gene copies and virulence factor expression of , both dietary phytase supplementation and LA-treatment of cereals drastically altered the bacterial community composition in pig feces.

Lobsters in SBCCs displayed significantly more species-rich and species-diverse gut  compared to those retained in LBC. A reduction in the bacterial diversity of the gut was also associated with higher infection prevalence of the enteric viral pathogen Homarus gammarus nudivirus (HgNV).

However, the effects of gut  on insect immunity remain mostly elusive. Red palm weevil (RPW),  Olivier, is a destructive pest of palm trees worldwide, which has forged alliances with its gut . Here, we found that the aposymbiotic insects succumbed at a significantly faster rate than conventionally reared (CR) ones upon bacterial infection. Physiological assays confirmed that CR insects had stronger antimicrobial activity and higher phenoloxidase activity in contrast to germfree (GF) ones, indicating that the systemic immune responses of GF individuals were compromised markedly. Interestingly, under the bacterial challenge conditions, the reassociation of gut  with GF insects could enhance their survival rate by rescuing their immunocompetence. Furthermore, comparative transcriptome analysis uncovered that 35 immune-related genes, including pathogen recognition receptors, effectors and immune signaling pathway, were significantly downregulated in GF insects as compared to CR ones. Collectively, our findings corrobate that intestinal commensal bacteria have profound immunostimulatory effects on RPW larvae. Therefore, knowledge on the effects of gut  on RPW immune defenses may contribute to of set up efficient control strategies of this pest.Copyright © 2019 Muhammad, Habineza, Ji, Hou and Shi.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681211>Cross-Regional View of Functional and Taxonomic  Composition in Obesity and Post-obesity Treatment Shows Country Specific Microbial Contribution.</a></h1><p>Gut  has been shown to have an important influence on host health. The microbial composition of the human gut  is modulated by diet and other lifestyle habits and it has been reported that microbial diversity is altered in obese people. Obesity is a worldwide health problem that negatively impacts the quality of life. Currently, the widespread treatment for obesity is bariatric surgery. Interestingly, gut  has been shown to be a relevant factor in effective weight loss after bariatric surgery. Since that the human gut  of normal subjects differs between geographic regions, it is possible that rearrangements of the gut  in dysbiosis context are also region-specific. To better understand how gut  contribute to obesity, this study compared the composition of the human gut  of obese and lean people from six different regions and showed that the  compositions in the context of obesity were specific to each studied geographic location. Furthermore, we analyzed the functional patterns using shotgun DNA metagenomic sequencing and compared the results with other obesity-related metagenomic studies, we observed that microbial contribution to functional pathways were country-specific. Nevertheless, our study showed that although microbial composition of obese patients was country-specific, the overall metabolic functions appeared to be the same between countries, indicating that different  components contribute to similar metabolic outcomes to yield functional redundancy. Furthermore, we studied the  functional changes of obese patients after bariatric surgery, by shotgun metagenomics sequencing and observed that changes in functional pathways were specific to the type of obesity treatment. In all, our study provides new insights into the differences and similarities of obese gut  in relation to geographic location and obesity treatments.Copyright © 2019 Medina, Li, Thomson, Artacho, Pérez-Brocal and Moya.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680682> Analysis Using Two-step PCR and Next-generation 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing.</a></h1><p>The human gut is colonized by trillions of bacteria that support physiologic functions such as food metabolism, energy harvesting, and regulation of the immune system. Perturbation of the healthy gut  has been suggested to play a role in the development of inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Environmental and genetic factors can influence the composition of the ; therefore, identification of microbial communities linked with a disease phenotype has become the first step towards defining the 's role in health and disease. Use of 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing for profiling bacterial community has helped in advancing  research. Despite its wide use, there is no uniform protocol for 16S rRNA-based taxonomic profiling analysis. Another limitation is the low resolution of taxonomic assignment due to technical difficulties such as smaller sequencing reads, as well as use of only forward (R1) reads in the final analysis due to low quality of reverse (R2) reads. There is need for a simplified method with high resolution to characterize bacterial diversity in a given biospecimen. Advancements in sequencing technology with the ability to sequence longer reads at high resolution have helped to overcome some of these challenges. Present sequencing technology combined with a publicly available metagenomic analysis pipeline such as R-based Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm-2 (DADA2) has helped advance microbial profiling at high resolution, as DADA2 can assign sequence at the genus and species levels. Described here is a guide for performing bacterial profiling using two-step amplification of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, followed by analysis using freely available analysis tools (i.e., DADA2, Phyloseq, and METAGENassist).

Its presence within the animal and human intestinal  was correlated with immunomodulatory effects, mediated by both propionibacterial surface components and by secreted metabolites. It is widely implemented, both in the manufacture of fermented dairy products such as Swiss-type cheeses, and in the production of probiotic food complements, under the form of freeze-dried powders. The bottleneck of this drying process consists in the limited survival of bacteria during drying and storage. Protective pre-treatments have been applied to other bacteria and may, in a strain-dependent manner, confer enhanced resistance. However, very little information was yet published on  adaptation to freeze-drying. In this report, an immunomodulatory strain of this probiotic bacterium was cultured under hyperosmotic constraint in order to trigger osmoadaptation. This adaptation was then combined with acid or thermal pre-treatment. Such combination led to accumulation of key stress proteins, of intracellular compatible solute glycine betaine, to modulation of the propionibacterial membrane composition, and to enhanced survival upon freeze-drying.

RbgA is one of these GTPases and is required for the assembly of the 50S subunit in most bacteria. Homologs of this protein are also implicated in the assembly of the large subunit of the mitochondrial and eukaryotic ribosome. We present here the cryo-electron microscopy structure of RbgA bound to a Bacillus subtilis 50S subunit assembly intermediate (45SRbgA particle) that accumulates in cells upon RbgA depletion. Binding of RbgA at the P site of the immature particle stabilizes functionally important rRNA helices in the A and P-sites, prior to the completion of the maturation process of the subunit. The structure also reveals the location of the highly conserved N-terminal end of RbgA containing the catalytic residue Histidine 9. The derived model supports a mechanism of GTP hydrolysis, and it shows that upon interaction of RbgA with the 45SRbgA particle, Histidine 9 positions itself near the nucleotide potentially acting as the catalytic residue with minimal rearrangements. This structure represents the first visualization of the conformational changes induced by an assembly factor in a bacterial subunit intermediate.© The Author(s) 2019.

A question that remains to be answered is whether such a fundamental process would still be that important in an over-fertilized world, as the long-term effects of fertilization on N fixation and associated diazotrophic communities remain to be tested. Here, we used a 35-year fertilization experiment, and investigated the changes in N fixation rates and the diazotrophic community in response to long-term inorganic and organic fertilization.It was found that N fixation was drastically reduced (dropped by 50%) after almost four decades of fertilization. Our results further indicated that functionality losses were associated with reductions in the relative abundance of keystone and phylogenetically clustered N fixers such as Geobacter spp.Our work suggests that long-term fertilization might have selected against N fixation and specific groups of N fixers.

An obstacle to understanding this contradiction has been a shortage of in vivo models reproducing the unique structure and immunology of human skin. In this work, we developed a humanized model to study how healthy adult human skin responds to colonizing methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). We demonstrate the importance of the outer stratum corneum as the major site of bacterial colonization and how noninvasive MRSA adhesion to corneocytes induces a local inflammatory response in underlying skin layers. This signaling recruits neutrophils to the skin, where they control bacterial numbers, mediating transiency in colonization. This work highlights the spatiotemporal aspects of human skin colonization and demonstrates a subclinical inflammatory response to noninvasive MRSA that allows human skin to regulate the bacterial population at its outer surface.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Many approaches used for the study of microbial interactions require specialized equipment and are expensive and time intensive. This paper presents a protocol for co-culture interaction assays that are inexpensive, scalable to large sample numbers, and easily adaptable to numerous experimental designs. Microorganisms are cultured together, with each well representing one pairwise combination of microorganisms. A test organism is cultured on one side of each well and first incubated in monoculture. Subsequently, target organisms are simultaneously inoculated onto the opposite side of each well using a 3D-printed inoculation stamp. After co-culture, the completed assays are scored for visual phenotypes, such as growth or inhibition. These assays can be used to confirm phenotypes or identify patterns among isolates of interest. Using this simple and effective method, users can analyze combinations of microorganisms rapidly and efficiently. This co-culture approach is applicable to antibiotic discovery as well as culture-based  research and has already been successfully applied to both applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664856>Editorial Focus on: "Maternal Antibiotics Augment Hyperoxia Induced Lung Injury in Neonatal Mice".</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666099>Fingerprinting cities: differentiating subway  functionality.</a></h1><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that the human  impacts individual and public health. City subway systems are human-dense environments, where passengers often exchange microbes. The MetaSUB project participants collected samples from subway surfaces in different cities and performed metagenomic sequencing. Previous studies focused on taxonomic composition of these microbiomes and no explicit functional analysis had been done till now.As a part of the 2018 CAMDA challenge, we functionally profiled the available ~ 400 subway metagenomes and built predictor for city origin. In cross-validation, our model reached 81% accuracy when only the top-ranked city assignment was considered and 95% accuracy if the second city was taken into account as well. Notably, this performance was only achievable if the similarity of distribution of cities in the training and testing sets was similar. To assure that our methods are applicable without such biased assumptions we balanced our training data to account for all represented cities equally well. After balancing, the performance of our method was slightly lower (76/94%, respectively, for one or two top ranked cities), but still consistently high. Here we attained an added benefit of independence of training set city representation. In testing, our unbalanced model thus reached (an over-estimated) performance of 90/97%, while our balanced model was at a more reliable 63/90% accuracy. While, by definition of our model, we were not able to predict the  origins previously unseen, our balanced model correctly judged them to be NOT-from-training-cities over 80% of the time. Our function-based outlook on microbiomes also allowed us to note similarities between both regionally close and far-away cities. Curiously, we identified the depletion in mycobacterial functions as a signature of cities in New Zealand, while photosynthesis related functions fingerprinted New York, Porto and Tokyo.We demonstrated the power of our high-speed function annotation method, mi-faser, by analysing ~ 400 shotgun metagenomes in 2 days, with the results recapitulating functional signals of different city subway microbiomes. We also showed the importance of balanced data in avoiding over-estimated performance. Our results revealed similarities between both geographically close (Ofa and Ilorin) and distant (Boston and Porto, Lisbon and New York) city subway microbiomes. The photosynthesis related functional signatures of NYC were previously unseen in taxonomy studies, highlighting the strength of functional analysis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671233>Effects of acute heat stress on intestinal  in grow-finishing pigs, and associations with feed intake and serum profile.</a></h1><p>This study was conducted to assess the effects of acute heat stress (HS) on intestinal , and the associations with the changes in feed intake (FI) and serum profile.Twenty four individually housed pigs (Duroc × Large White × Landrace, 30 ± 1 kg body weight) were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 treatments (8 pigs / treatment): 1) thermal neutral (TN) conditions (25 ± 1°C), 2) HS conditions (35 ± 1°C), 3) pair-feeding (PF) with HS under TN conditions. After 24-h treatment, pigs were monitored to assess feed intake (FI), and samples of serum and feces were collected to investigate serum profile, microbial composition, and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The results showed that HS decreased (P < 0.05) FI compared with the TN group. Compared with TN group, HS changed serum profile by affecting biochemical parameters and hormones related with energy metabolism and stress response; immune indicators were also altered in HS group. Most of changes in serum profile were independent of FI reduction. Additionally, HS shifted the diversity and composition of fecal microbial community by increasing (P < 0.05) Proteobacteria and decreasing (P < 0.05) Bacteroidetes. Moreover, HS decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of propionate, butyrate, valerate, iso-valerate, and total SCFAs in feces with a FI-independent manner. Furthermore, the Spearman correlation analysis implied that changes of serum profile have potential correlation with alterations of fecal  and their metabolites SCFAs in acute HS-treated grow-finishing pigs.Metabolism disorders caused by 24-h acute HS associated with changes of fecal  and their metabolites SCFAs with a FI-independent manner in grow-finishing pigs.These results give us a new insight of the intestinal damage caused by acute HS and the underlying mechanisms.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673418>Cartilage-gut- axis: a new paradigm for novel therapeutic opportunities in osteoarthritis.</a></h1><p>DNA of gut  can be found in synovium of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. This finding could result from the translocation of still alive bacteria from gut to joints through blood, since the diversified dormant  of healthy human blood can be transiently resuscitated in vitro. The recent finding of gut  in human cartilage, which differed between osteoarthritis and controls, suggests that a similar trafficking of dead or alive bacteria from gut  physiologically occurs between gut and epiphysial bone marrow. Subchondral  could enhance cartilage healing and transform components of deep cartilage matrix in metabolites with immunosuppressive properties. The differences of  observed between hip and knee cartilage, either in osteoarthritis or controls, might be the counterpart of subtle differences in chondrocyte metabolism, themselves in line with differences in DNA methylation according to joints. Although bacteria theoretically cannot reach chondrocytes from the surface of intact cartilage, some bacteria enter the vascular channels of the epiphysial growth cartilage in young animals, whereas others can infect chondrocytes in vitro. In osteoarthritis, the early osteochondral plate angiogenesis may further enhance the ability of  to locate close to the deeper layers of cartilage, and this might lead to focal dysbiosis, low-grade inflammation, cartilage degradation, epigenetic changes in chondrocytes and worsening of osteoarthritis. More studies on cartilage across different ethnic groups, weights, and according to age, are needed, to confirm the silent presence of gut  close to human cartilage and better understand its physiologic and pathogenic significance.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Iron fortificants adversely affect the infant gut , while co-provision of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) mitigates most of the adverse effects. Whether variations in maternal HMO profile can influence the infant response to iron and/or GOS fortificants is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine HMO profiles and the secretor/non-secretor phenotype of lactating Kenyan mothers and investigate their effects on the maternal and infant gut , and on the infant response to a fortification intervention with 5 mg iron (2.5 mg as sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate and 2.5 mg as ferrous fumarate) and 7.5 g GOS. We studied mother-infant pairs ( = 80) participating in a 4-month intervention trial in which the infants (aged 6.5-9.5 months) received daily a micronutrient powder without iron, with iron or with iron and GOS. We assessed: (1) maternal secretor status and HMO composition; (2) effects of secretor status on the maternal and infant gut  in a cross-sectional analysis at baseline of the intervention trial; and (3) interactions between secretor status and intervention groups during the intervention trial on the infant gut , gut inflammation, iron status, growth and infectious morbidity. Secretor prevalence was 72% and HMOs differed between secretors and non-secretors and over time of lactation. Secretor status did not predict the baseline composition of the maternal and infant gut . There was a secretor-status-by-intervention-group interaction on  ( = 0.021), Z-scores for length-for-age ( = 0.022) and weight-for-age ( = 0.018), and soluble transferrin receptor ( = 0.041). In the no iron group, longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea was higher among infants of non-secretors (23.8%) than of secretors (10.4%) ( = 0.001). In conclusion, HMO profile may modulate the infant gut  response to fortificant iron; compared to infants of secretor mothers, infants of non-secretor mothers may be more vulnerable to the adverse effect of iron but also benefit more from the co-provision of GOS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676992>Natural Communities of Carotenogenic Chlorophyte Haematococcus lacustris and Bacteria from the White Sea Coastal Rock Ponds.</a></h1><p>Haematococcus lacustris is a biotechnologically important green unicellular alga producing widely used keta-karotenoid astaxanthin. In natural habitats, it exists in the form of algal-bacterial community, and under laboratory conditions, it is also accompanied by bacteria. The issue of the bacterial composition of industrial algal cultures is widely recognized as important. However, there is a dearth of information about bacterial composition of H. lacustris communities. In current work, we analyze the composition of natural H. lacustris communities from the White Sea coastal temporal rock ponds. For the first time, a 16S rRNA gene-based metagenome of natural H. lacustris bacterial communities has been generated. Main results of its analysis are as follow. Bacterial families Comamonadaceae, Cytophagaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Acetobacteraceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Rhodocyclaceae were observed in all studied H. lacustris natural communities. They also contained genera Hydrogenophaga and Cytophaga. Bacteria from the Hydrogenophaga genus were present in H. lacustris cultures after their isolation under the conditions of laboratory cultivation. Similar to other planktonic microalgae, H. lacustris forms a phycosphere around the cells. In this zone, bacteria attached to the algal surface. The contact between H. lacustris and bacteria is maintained even after sample drying. The study provides information about possible members of H. lacustris core , which can be presented in the industrial and laboratory cultures of the microalga.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669656>A method to assess bioavailability of antibiotics in anthropogenic polluted ecosystems by using a bacterial fitness test.</a></h1><p>Antibiotics released in the environment exert a selective pressure on the resident . It is well accepted that the mere measurement of antibiotics does not reflect the actual bioavailability. In fact, antibiotics can be adsorbed or complexed to particles and/or chemicals in water and soil. Bioavailable concentrations of antibiotics in soil and water are subjected to great uncertainty, therefore biological assays are increasingly recognized as that allow an indirect determination of the residual antibiotic activity. Here we propose how a fitness test for bacteria can be used to qualitatively assess the bioavailability of a specific antibiotic in the environment. The findings show that by using a pair of resistant and sensitive bacterial strains, the resulting fitness can indirectly reflect antibiotic bioavailability. Hence, this test can be used as a complementary assay to other biological and chemical tests to assess bioavailability of antibiotics.Copyright © 2018.

The commensal  is known to contribute to IgA production in the gut; however, the role of dietary antigens in IgA production is poorly understood. To understand the effect of dietary antigens on IgA production, post-weaning mice were maintained on an elemental diet without any large immunogenic molecules. We found that dietary antigens contribute to IgA production in PPs through induction of follicular helper T cells and germinal center B cells. The role of dietary antigens in the PP responses was further confirmed by adding bovine serum albumin (BSA) into the elemental diet. Although dietary antigens are important for PP responses, they have fewer effects than the  on the development and maturation of ILFs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that dietary antigens are essential for a normal antigen-specific IgA response to  serovar Typhimurium infection.

Vancomycin, the antimicrobial agent usually used to treat bacterial nosocomial infections, is associated with gut dysbiosis. As a lung-gut immunologic axis has been described, this study aimed to evaluate both the immunologic and histopathologic effects on the lungs and the large intestine resulting from vancomycin-induced gut dysbiosis in the P. aeruginosa pneumonia murine model. Metagenomic analysis demonstrated that vancomycin-induced gut dysbiosis resulted in higher Proteobacteria and lower Bacteroidetes populations in feces. Given that gut dysbiosis could augment the proinflammatory status of the intestines leading to a variety of acute inflammatory diseases, bone marrow-derived macrophages were stimulated with cecal content from dysbiotic mice showing a higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines and lower expression of IL-10. Dysbiotic mice showed higher levels of viable bacteria in the lungs and spleen when acutely infected with P. aeruginosa, with more lung and cecal damage and increased IL-10 expression in bronchoalveolar lavage. The susceptible and tissue damage phenotype was reversed when dysbiotic mice received fecal  transplantation. In spite of higher recruitment of CD11b+ cells in the lungs, there was no higher CD80+ expression, DC+ cell amounts or proinflammatory cytokine expression. Taken together, our results indicate that the bacterial community found in vancomycin-induced dysbiosis dysregulates the gut inflammatory status, influencing the lung-gut immunologic axis to favor increased opportunistic infections, for example, by P. aeruginosa.©2019 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668602>Dietary Habits of 2- to 9-Year-Old American Children Are Associated with Gut  Composition.</a></h1><p>The human gut  is recognized as an important determinant of human health, yet little is known about how dietary habits are related to the  in post-weaned, pre-pubescent children.The goal of this work was to link quantitative dietary intake with  features in a diverse population of children consuming a predominantly Western diet.This was a cross-sectional study.English- or Spanish-speaking families with healthy children between the ages of 2 and 9 years were recruited from a community-based, early childhood learning center in suburban Los Angeles, California between June and September 2014.Children included in the analyses (n=75) contributed three fecal samples and three quantitative 24-hour dietary recalls using the multiple-pass method with an average of 5.7 days between samples. Microbial communities of each fecal sample were characterized using Illumina sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Dietary recalls were analyzed using the Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Recall Dietary Assessment Tool.Associations between dietary factors and  features were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman rank correlations, or permutational multivariate analysis of variance. For demographic and health-related variables, χ analyses were used to test for differences between age groups for categorical variables.Our results show that age is correlated with three metrics of  diversity (P<0.05) and is associated with both community structure (P=0.0488) and membership (P=0.0002). Several dietary food groups and nutrients were likewise associated with  features. For example, consumption of non-whole-grain foods was associated with community structure (P=0.0089) and membership (P=0.0057), but not diversity (P>0.05). Likewise, the relative abundance of several bacterial taxa were linked to consumption of particular food groups and/or nutrients, as illustrated by the positive associations between total fruit (P<0.05) and fiber (P<0.05) consumption with the relative abundance of the Lachnospira genera.This hypothesis-generating study demonstrates that the composition of the child gut  remains dynamic beyond the age of 3 years and responds to dietary differences across individuals. In particular, non-whole-grain foods fortified with vitamins and minerals appear to be associated with the composition of the .

This may result from altered energy metabolism or dietary habits.We hypothesized that a lower intake of BCAAs improves tissue-specific insulin sensitivity.This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial examined well-controlled T2D patients receiving isocaloric diets (protein: 1 g/kg body weight) for 4 wk. Protein requirements were covered by commercially available food supplemented ≤60% by an AA mixture either containing all AAs or lacking BCAAs. The dietary intervention ensured sufficient BCAA supply above the recommended minimum daily intake. The patients underwent the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (HECs), and skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue biopsies to assess insulin signaling.After the BCAA- diet, BCAAs were reduced by 17% during fasting (P < 0.001), by 13% during HEC (P < 0.01), and by 62% during the MMT (P < 0.001). Under clamp conditions, whole-body and hepatic insulin sensitivity did not differ between diets.

However, the relationship between fecal  and hematologic malignancy requires further investigation. This study aimed to characterize the relationship of the fecal microbial community in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 40 MM patients and healthy controls (n=17) were retrospectively collected from the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University between October 2018 and May 2019. The fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing for the fecal microbial community, as well as diversity and correlation analysis. Furthermore, 21 MM patients and their family members were selected for the matched pair analysis to confirm the fecal  taxonomic changes by qRT-PCR assay. RESULTS Diversity analysis showed that diversity measured by Shannon index was lower in MM patients compared with healthy controls. At the phylum level, higher abundances of Proteobacteria but lower abundances of Actinobacteria were identified in the MM group in comparison with the healthy control group. At the genus level, the proportion of Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Roseburia was significantly higher in the MM group. The matched pair analysis showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Faecalibacterium were significantly more abundant in the MM group. Further analysis on prognostic risk factors revealed that the Faecalibacterium prausnitzii level was significantly correlated with ISS stage. CONCLUSIONS Our study highlights the imbalanced composition and diversity of the gastrointestinal  in MM patients, which could be further used as a potential biomarker for MM risk screening, therapeutic strategies, and prognostic prediction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680787>The Duplex Interaction of  with Chemoradiation and Immunotherapy: Potential Implications for Colorectal Cancer.</a></h1><p>Gut  has the ability to modify the metabolism of wide array of therapeutic drugs. Current treatment modalities used in colorectal cancer have a narrow therapeutic index with a side effects profile that decreases tolerance to these treatments and adversely affects treatment outcome. Harnessing the gut  ability to modify oncotherapeutic drugs metabolism and hence efficacy, could be potentially used to improve treatment outcomes in colorectal cancer patients. This review will shed lights on important findings from recent  interaction studies which would hopefully serve as a useful tool to guide future translative colorectal cancer research.Recent advances in  studies have revealed an interesting aspect of gut microbes carcinogenic properties in dysbiotic gut environment.  niche in colorectal cancer can also modify efficacy and toxicity profile of different oncotherapeutic treatment modalities from chemoradiotherapy to immunotherapy. Conversely, each of these treatment modalities has numerous effects on the gastrointestinal flora, causing changes in the gut microbial community that affects host morbidity and mortality.Symbiotic gut  is an incredible functioning organ that maintains essential aspects of our homeostasis and immunity. According to the recent body of literature, they also can modify efficacy of many therapeutic drugs including oncotherapy.

Here, we investigated the ecological drivers of the bacterial gut  in cockroaches that feed on lignocellulosic leaf litter.The physicochemical conditions determined with microsensors in the guts of Ergaula capucina, Pycnoscelus surinamensis, and Byrsotria rothi were similar to those reported for both wood-feeding and omnivorous cockroaches. All gut compartments were anoxic at the center and showed a slightly acidic to neutral pH and variable but slightly reducing conditions. Hydrogen accumulated only in the crop of B. rothi. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes documented that community structure in individual gut compartments correlated strongly with the respective microenvironmental conditions. A comparison of the hindgut  of cockroaches and termites from different feeding groups revealed that the vast majority of the core taxa in cockroaches with a lignocellulosic diet were present also in omnivorous cockroaches but absent in wood-feeding higher termites.Our results indicate that diet is not the primary driver of bacterial community structure in the gut of wood- and litter-feeding cockroaches. The high similarity to the gut  of omnivorous cockroaches suggests that the dietary components that are actually digested do not differ fundamentally between feeding groups.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675917>Optimizing  sequencing for small intestinal aspirates: validation of novel techniques through the REIMAGINE study.</a></h1><p>The human small intestine plays a central role in the processes of digestion and nutrient absorption. However, characterizations of the human gut  have largely relied on stool samples, and the associated methodologies are ill-suited for the viscosity and low microbial biomass of small intestine samples. As part of the REIMAGINE study to examine the specific roles of the small bowel  in human health and disease, this study aimed to develop and validate methodologies to optimize microbial analysis of the small intestine.Subjects undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy without colon preparation for standard of care were prospectively recruited, and ~ 2 ml samples of luminal fluid were obtained from the duodenum using a custom sterile aspiration catheter. Samples of duodenal aspirates were either untreated (DA-U, N = 127) or pretreated with dithiothreitol (DA-DTT, N = 101), then cultured on MacConkey agar for quantitation of aerobic gram-negative bacteria, typically from the class Gammaproteobacteria, and on blood agar for quantitation of anaerobic microorganisms. DA-DTT exhibited 2.86-fold greater anaerobic bacterial counts compared to DA-U (P = 0.0101), but were not statistically different on MacConkey agar. DNA isolation from DA-U (N = 112) and DA-DTT (N = 43) samples and library preparation for 16S rRNA gene sequencing were also performed using modified protocols. DA-DTT samples exhibited 3.81-fold higher DNA concentrations (P = 0.0014) and 4.18-fold higher 16S library concentrations (P < 0.0001) then DA-U samples. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed increases in the detected relative abundances of obligate and facultative anaerobes in DA-DTT samples, including increases in the genera Clostridium (false discovery rate (FDR) P = 4.38E-6), Enterococcus (FDR P = 2.57E-8), Fusobacterium (FDR P = 0.02) and Bacteroides (FDR P = 5.43E-9). Detected levels of Gram-negative enteropathogens from the phylum Proteobacteria, such as Klebsiella (FDR P = 2.73E-6) and Providencia (FDR P < 0.0001) (family Enterobacteriaceae) and Pseudomonas (family Pseudomonadaceae) (FDR P = 0.04), were also increased in DA-DTT samples.This study validates novel DTT-based methodology which optimizes microbial culture and 16S rRNA gene sequencing for the study of the small bowel .

Monomeric flavan-3-ols are rapidly absorbed in the small intestine and released in the blood stream as phase II conjugates. Polymeric flavan-3-ols are extensively metabolized by colonic gut  into phenyl-γ-valerolactones and their related phenylvaleric acids. These molecules are the main circulating metabolites in humans after the ingestion of flavan-3-ol rich-products; nevertheless, they have received less attention and their role is not understood yet. Here, we describe the quantification of 8 phenyl-γ-valerolactones and 3 phenylvaleric acids in the urine of 11 subjects on consumption of apples by using UHPLC-ESI-Triple Quad-MS with pure reference compounds. Phenyl-γ-valerolactones, mainly as sulfate and glucuronic acid conjugates, reached maximum excretion between 6 and 12 after apple consumption, with a decline thereafter. Significant differences were detected in the cumulative excretion rates within subjects and in the ratio of dihydroxyphenyl-γ-valerolactone sulfate to glucuronide conjugates.

Host diet and host gut microbiomes are two increasingly recognized factors influencing disease resistance. In particular, recent studies demonstrate that (1) particular diets can reduce parasitism; (2) diets can alter the gut ; and (3) the gut  can decrease parasitism. These three separate relationships suggest the existence of indirect links through which diets reduce parasitism through an alteration of the gut . However, such links are rarely considered and even more rarely experimentally validated. This is surprising because there is increasing discussion of the therapeutic potential of diets and gut microbiomes to control infectious disease. To elucidate these potential indirect links, we review and examine studies on a wide range of animal systems commonly used in diet, , and disease research. We also examine the relative benefits and disadvantages of particular systems for the study of these indirect links and conclude that mice and insects are currently the best animal systems to test for the effect of diet-altered protective gut microbiomes on infectious disease. Focusing on these systems, we provide experimental guidelines and highlight challenges that must be overcome. Although previous studies have recommended these systems for  research, here we specifically recommend these systems because of their proven relationships between diet and parasitism, between diet and the , and between the  and parasite resistance. Thus, they provide a sound foundation to explore the three-way interaction between diet, the , and infectious disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673547>Potential therapeutic strategies to target gut  in hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670066>Maternal exercise before and during pregnancy alleviates metabolic dysfunction associated with high-fat diet in pregnant mice, without significant changes in gut .</a></h1><p>Although maternal exercise before and during pregnancy is beneficial, the effects of exercise on  changes during pregnancy are unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that maternal exercise before and during pregnancy would positively affect glucose homeostasis, pancreatic cell function, and gut  dysbiosis in high-fat diet (HFD) fed dams. Female C57BL/6 mice were fed either a HFD or a low-fat diet (LFD) for 12 weeks. The HFD mice were split into two groups for 4 weeks prior to pregnancy initiation and throughout the pregnancy: sedentary (HFD) or exercised (HFD + Ex). Food intake, body weight, body composition, and glucose and insulin tolerance were measured. At gestation day 19, blood, pancreas, gonadal visceral and subcutaneous fat, plantaris muscle, and cecum were collected for analysis. Both HFD and HFD + Ex mice had impaired glucose clearance compared to LFD mice at 15 days of gestation. No changes were found in pancreatic α- or β-cell health. HFD + Ex mice had significantly reduced visceral fat mass, serum insulin, and leptin levels and increased high-density lipoprotein levels, compared to HFD-fed mice. In contrast to our hypothesis,  diversity and composition were not different among groups. The relative abundance of five bacterial phyla, such as Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Deferribacteres, and Actinobacteria, were not significantly altered with diet or exercise during pregnancy. Our findings suggest that maternal exercise prevents excess visceral fat accumulation, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia associated with a HFD, but not through the alterations of gut  composition or diversity during pregnancy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the use of such in silico pipelines for the microbial taxonomic classification of short sequences may lead to significant errors in the compositional outputs deduced from such sequencing data. To investigate the ability of such in silico pipelines, we employed two commonly applied bioinformatic tools, i.e., MetaPhlAn2 and Kraken2 together with two metagenomic datasets originating from human and animal fecal samples. By using these bioinformatic programs that taxonomically classify WSM data based on marker genes, we observed a tend to depict a lower complexity of the microbial communities. Here, we assess the limitations of the most commonly employed bioinformatic pipelines, i.e., MetaPhlAn2 and Kraken2, and based on our findings, we propose that such analyses should ideally be combined with experimentally-based microbiological validations.

To determine the role of  on longevity animal models, we investigated the changes in the GM of df/df and Normal control (N) mice, by comparing parents before mating and littermate mice at three distinct time points during early life. Furthermore, we studied the effects of a 6-month calorie restriction (CR), the most powerful intervention extending the lifespan. Our data revealed significant changes of the GM composition during early life development, and we detected differences in the abundance of some bacteria between df/df and N mice, already in early life. Overall, the variability of the  by genotype, time-point and breeding pair showed significant differences. In addition, CR caused significant changes in  according to gastrointestinal (GI) location (distal colon, ileum and cecum), genotype and diet. However, the overall impact of the genotype was more prominent than that of the CR. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the gut  plays an important role during post-natal development in long-living df/df mice and CR dietary regimen can significantly modulate the GM.© The Author(s) 2019.

We sought to understand how acquired cellular and humoral immunity to the  differ in health versus inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Resident memory T-cells (Trm) in colonic biopsies and local antibody responses to intraepithelial microbes were analyzed. Systemic antigen-specific immune T- and B-cell memory to a panel of commensal microbes was assessed.Systemically, healthy blood showed CD4 and occasional CD8 memory T-cell responses to selected intestinal bacteria but few memory B-cell responses. In IBD, CD8 memory T-cell responses decreased although B-cell responses and circulating plasmablasts increased. Possibly secondary to loss of systemic CD8 T-cell responses in IBD, dramatically reduced numbers of mucosal CD8+ Trm and γδ T-cells were observed. IgA responses to intraepithelial bacteria were increased. Colonic Trm expressed CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, characteristic of regulatory T-cells. Cytokines/factors required for Trm differentiation were identified, and in vitro-generated Trm expressed regulatory T-cell function via CD39. Cognate interaction between T-cells and dendritic cells induced T-bet expression in dendritic cells, a key mechanism in regulating cell-mediated mucosal responses.A previously unrecognized imbalance exists between cellular and humoral immunity to the  in IBD, with loss of mucosal T-cell-mediated barrier immunity and uncontrolled antibody responses. Regulatory function of Trm may explain their association with intestinal health. Promoting Trm and their interaction with dendritic cells rather than immunosuppression may reinforce tissue immunity, improve barrier function and prevent B-cell dysfunction in -associated disease and IBD etiology.© European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676016>Fueling ab initio folding with marine metagenomics enables structure and function predictions of new protein families.</a></h1><p>The ocean  represents one of the largest microbiomes and produces nearly half of the primary energy on the planet through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Using recent advances in marine genomics, we explore new applications of oceanic metagenomes for protein structure and function prediction.By processing 1.3 TB of high-quality reads from the Tara Oceans data, we obtain 97 million non-redundant genes. Of the 5721 Pfam families that lack experimental structures, 2801 have at least one member associated with the oceanic metagenomics dataset. We apply C-QUARK, a deep-learning contact-guided ab initio structure prediction pipeline, to model 27 families, where 20 are predicted to have a reliable fold with estimated template modeling score (TM-score) at least 0.5. Detailed analyses reveal that the abundance of microbial genera in the ocean is highly correlated to the frequency of occurrence in the modeled Pfam families, suggesting the significant role of the Tara Oceans genomes in the contact-map prediction and subsequent ab initio folding simulations. Of interesting note, PF15461, which has a majority of members coming from ocean-related bacteria, is identified as an important photosynthetic protein by structure-based function annotations. The pipeline is extended to a set of 417 Pfam families, built on the combination of Tara with other metagenomics datasets, which results in 235 families with an estimated TM-score over 0.5.These results demonstrate a new avenue to improve the capacity of protein structure and function modeling through marine metagenomics, especially for difficult proteins with few homologous sequences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665056>Regional biogeography of  composition in the Chagas disease vector Rhodnius pallescens.</a></h1><p>Triatomine bugs are vectors of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease. Rhodnius pallescens is a major vector of Chagas disease in Panama. Understanding the microbial ecology of disease vectors is important in the development of vector management strategies that target vector survival and fitness. In this study we examined the whole-body microbial composition of R. pallescens from three locations in Panama.We collected 89 R. pallescens specimens using Noireau traps in Attalea butyracea palms. We then extracted total DNA from whole-bodies of specimens and amplified bacterial  using 16S rRNA metabarcoding PCR. The 16S libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq and analyzed using QIIME2 software.We found Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes to be the most abundant bacterial phyla across all samples. Geographical location showed the largest difference in microbial composition with northern Veraguas Province having the most diversity and Panama Oeste Province localities being most similar to each other. Wolbachia was detected in high abundance (48-72%) at Panama Oeste area localities with a complete absence of detection in Veraguas Province. No significant differences in microbial composition were detected between triatomine age class, primary blood meal source, or T. cruzi infection status.We found biogeographical regions differ in microbial composition among R. pallescens populations in Panama. While overall the  has bacterial taxa consistent with previous studies in triatomine microbial ecology, locality differences are an important observation for future studies. Geographical heterogeneity in microbiomes of vectors is an important consideration for future developments that leverage microbiomes for disease control.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665644>Reprogramming Bacteriophage Host Range through Structure-Guided Design of Chimeric Receptor Binding Proteins.</a></h1><p>Bacteriophages provide excellent tools for diagnostics, remediation, and targeted  manipulation, yet isolating viruses with suitable host specificity remains challenging. Using Listeria phage PSA, we present a synthetic biology blueprint for host-range engineering through targeted modification of serovar-specific receptor binding proteins (RBPs). We identify Gp15 as the PSA RBP and construct a synthetic phage library featuring sequence-randomized RBPs, from which host range mutants are isolated and subsequently integrated into a synthetic, polyvalent phage with extended host range. To enable rational design of chimeric RBPs, we determine the crystal structure of the Gp15 receptor-binding carboxyl terminus at 1.7-Å resolution and employ bioinformatics to identify compatible, prophage-encoded RBPs targeting different Listeria serovars. Structure-guided design enables exchange of heterologous RBP head, neck, or shoulder domains to generate chimeric phages with predictable and extended host ranges. These strategies will facilitate the development of phage biologics based on standardized virus scaffolds with tunable host specificities.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is found to be closely involved in the regulation of gut microbial dynamics. However, it is still not clear how AhR signaling shapes the gut . In the present study, adult zebrafish were acutely exposed to an AhR antagonist (CH223191), an AhR agonist (polychlorinated biphenyl 126; PCB126) or their combination for 7 d. Overall intestinal health and gut microbial community were temporally monitored (1 d, 3 d and 7 d) and inter-compared among different groups. The results showed that single exposure to PCB126 significantly disrupted the overall health of intestines (i.e., neural signaling, inflammation, epithelial barrier integrity, oxidative stress). However, CH223191 failed to inhibit but enhanced the physiological toxicities of PCB126, implying the involvement of extra mechanisms rather than AhR in the regulation of intestinal physiological activities. Dysbiosis of gut  was also caused by PCB126 over time as a function of sex. It is intriguing that CH223191 successfully abolished the holistic effects of dioxin on gut , which inferred that growth of gut microbes was directly controlled by AhR activation without the involvement of host feedback modulation. When coming to detailed alterations at certain taxon, both antagonistic and synergistic interactions existed between CH223191 and dioxin, depending on fish sex, exposure duration and bacterial species. Correlation analysis found that gut inflammation was positively associated with pathogenic Legionella bacteria, but was negatively associated with epithelial barrier integrity, suggesting that integral intestinal epithelial barrier can prevent the influx of pathogenic bacteria to induce inflammatory response. Overall, this study has deciphered, for the first time, the direct regulative effects of AhR activity on gut . Future research is warranted to elucidate the specific mechanisms of AhR action on certain bacterial population.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The reported prevalence rate of complete IgA deficiency in healthy children ranges from 1:170 to 1:400, and as a solitary condition, it is often considered of limited clinical importance. However, patients with IgA deficiency can develop recurrent respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, as well as allergic and autoimmune diseases. In children referred for recurrent respiratory tract infections, the observed prevalence rate increases more than tenfold. This review discusses several aspects of IgA deficiency in children, including immunologic and  changes in early childhood and the potential consequences of this condition in later life. It illustrates the importance of early identification of children with impaired IgA production who deserve appropriate clinical care and follow-up.Copyright © 2018.

Here, we examine the airway  during the first three months of life by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in the population-based Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC) cohort consisting of 700 children monitored for the development of asthma since birth. Microbial diversity and the relative abundances of Veillonella and Prevotella in the airways at age one month are associated with asthma by age 6 years, both individually and with additional taxa in a multivariable model. Higher relative abundance of these bacteria is furthermore associated with an airway immune profile dominated by reduced TNF-α and IL-1β and increased CCL2 and CCL17, which itself is an independent predictor for asthma.

IGFs take part in the embryonal development and postnatal growth, in interaction with the growth hormone (GH). The physiological effects of IGF1 are promotion of tissue growth and development, stimulation of cell proliferation, effects on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anabolic, anti-oxidant, neuro- and hepatoprotective properties. Our knowledge about the GH/IGF axis is diverse, partly contradictory, their research is continued intensively nowadays. We considered it worthwhile to review and interpret this information. Study on GH/IGF medical reports, with particular reference to the less known metabolic control. 75% of the growth factors are produced in the liver by GH and insulin stimulation; their effects are expressed on specific receptors, and modified by specific binding proteins. IGF1 directly increases the muscle mass, bone density, and the structure of the bones. Intestinal  induces secretion of IGF1, which promotes the development and remodeling of the bones. Short-chain fatty acids, produced in microbial fermented fibers, induce secretion of IGF1, suggesting that microbial activity also affects bone health  IGF1. IGF1 also has a direct and indirect glucose-lowering effect, enhances free fatty acid oxidation in the muscle, reducing the flow of free fatty acid into the liver, improving insulin signaling, resulting in the reduction of hepatic glucose output, and improves insulin sensitivity. IGF1 directly influences the expression of circadian BMAL1 in hypothalamic cells: this refers to the newly recognized 'zeitgeber' role of IGF1. The bioactivity of insulin-like peptides in the brain is characterized by neuronal survival, excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, maintenance of normal free fatty acid levels, improvement of cognitive function, protection against cell damage, neurogenesis and angiogenesis. The effects of IGF2 are less outlined, however, it has a relevant role in the development of the fetus, and acts protectively on the brain. Lack or over-expression of IGF1 can be detected or may causally associated in many pathological conditions. According to these collected data, insulin sensitivity may be improved by different pathways. The role of IGFs in these processes should be a task of future research.

Despite its lifesaving potential, immune-mediated allo-reactivity inherent to the allogeneic transplantation can be observed within up to 50% of all allo-HCT patients regularly resulting in the manifestation of acute and/or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Mechanistically, especially donor T cells are assumed to chiefly drive inflammation that can occur in virtually all organs, with the skin, liver, and gut representing as the most frequently affected anatomic sites. Especially in the presence of intestinal manifestations of GvHD, the risk that the disease takes a life-threatening, potentially fatal course is significantly increased. In the light of a rapid gain of knowledge in respect to decode innate and adaptive immunity related mechanisms as, e.g., cytokine networks, intracellular signaling pathways or environmental triggers as, e.g., the intestinal  and the development of novel therapeutic approaches, detailed insight into endogenous mechanisms seeking to counterbalance the proinflammatory machinery or to proactively foster signals promoting the resolution of allo-driven intestinal inflammation is emerging. Here, we seek to highlight the key aspects of those mechanisms involved in and contributing to the resolution of GvHD-associated intestinal inflammation. Concomitantly, we would like to briefly outline and discuss promising future experimental targets suitable to be therapeutically employed to directionally deflect the tissue response from a proinflammatory to an inflammation-resolving type of intestinal GvHD after allo-HCT.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678164>TEMPORARY REMOVAL: Quorum sensing molecules as a novel microbial factor influencing host skeletal muscle cells.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667520>The PATRIC Bioinformatics Resource Center: expanding data and analysis capabilities.</a></h1><p>The PathoSystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) is the bacterial Bioinformatics Resource Center funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (https://www.patricbrc.org).

Two important hubs have emerged, the placenta/prenatal period and the postnatal gut, with alterations in mitochondria functioning crucial in both.Factors acting to regulate mitochondria functioning in ASD across development are reviewed in this article.Decreased vitamin A, and its retinoic acid metabolites, lead to a decrease in CD38 and associated changes that underpin a wide array of data on the biological underpinnings of ASD, including decreased oxytocin, with relevance both prenatally and in the gut. Decreased sirtuins, poly-ADP ribose polymerase-driven decreases in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), hyperserotonemia, decreased monoamine oxidase, alterations in 14-3-3 proteins, microRNA alterations, dysregulated aryl hydrocarbon receptor activity, suboptimal mitochondria functioning, and decreases in the melatonergic pathways are intimately linked to this. Many of the above processes may be modulating, or mediated by, alterations in mitochondria functioning. Other bodies of data associated with ASD may also be incorporated within these basic processes, including how ASD risk factors such as maternal obesity and preeclampsia as well as more general prenatal stressors modulate the likelihood of offspring ASD.Such an integrated model of the pathophysiology of ASD has important preventative and treatment implications.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672892>Pathogen-induced activation of disease-suppressive functions in the endophytic root .</a></h1><p>Microorganisms living inside plants can promote plant growth and health, but their genomic and functional diversity remain largely elusive.

While clinical prediction tools exist, they do not incorporate the newest Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines.This was a prospective longitudinal study of patients experiencing their first episode of uncomplicated CDI. Patients were followed from diagnosis through 8 weeks post-completion of their anti-CDI therapy to assess recurrence. Stool was collected at diagnosis and weekly for 8 weeks following treatment. Recurrence was defined as diarrhea as well as a positive stool test by toxin EIA (EIA) for C. difficile. Fisher's exact test for binary variables and Student's t test for continuous variables were performed. Cox regression was performed to assess for predictors of CDI recurrence.Seventy-five patients were enrolled between August 1, 2015, and September 1, 2018. Mean age 58.1 years ± 15.5, 69.3% female, 74.7% were white, 11.3% had baseline irritable bowel syndrome, and 54.7% were actively using PPIs. Over the 8-week follow-up period, 22 patients developed a confirmed CDI recurrence. Univariate predictors of recurrence included treatment with metronidazole (40.9% vs 15.1%, p = 0.03), initially diagnosis by EIA (77.3% vs 43.4%, p = 0.007) and platelet count (206 ± 72.1 vs 270.9 ± 114.8, p = 0.03).

What constitutes a unique feature of this model is its twofold objective of introducing an ileal microbial community and mimicking a dietary weaning transition. This model should then be ideally suited to test the dietary weaning strategies of piglets in vitro. Regarding the , the main phyla making up the model were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria although Bacteroidetes decreased after inoculation (p = 0.043 in ileum, p = 0.021 in colon) and Delta-Proteobacteria were favoured (p = 0.083 in ileum, p = 0.043 in colon) compared to Gamma-Proteobacteria. The designed model led to a low representation of Bacilli - especially Lactobacillus sp. in the ileum and a weak representation of Bacteroidia in the proximal colon. However, Mitsuokella and Prevotella were part of the major genera of the model along with Bifidobacterium, Fusobacterium, Megasphaera and Bacteroides. As a result of weaning, two major changes - normally occurring in vivo - were detected in the system: firstly, Firmicutes diminished when Bacteroidetes increased particularly in the proximal colon; secondly, Bacteroides decreased and Prevotella increased (mean value for four runs). In terms of metabolite production, while a ratio acetate: propionate: butyrate of 60:26:14 was obtained in post-weaned colon, the expected inversion of the ratio propionate: butyrate in the post-weaned ileum was unfortunately not observed. To conclude, the so-called baby-SPIME model meets expectations regarding the resident  of the proximal colon bioreactor and the metabolites produced thereof. In terms of the evolution of major groups of bacteria, the in vitro weaning process appeared to be successful. However, higher concentration of butyric acid would have been expected in ileum part of newly weaned piglets, as observed in vivo. The  in the ileum bioreactor seemed in fact to act like a pre-colon. This suggests that microbial profile in ileum bioreactor had to be improved.Copyright © 2019.

Previous attention has been mostly paid to the effects of metallic oxide nanoparticles on the survival, growth and physiology of animals. In comparison, the effects on gut  and incidence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soil fauna remain poorly understood. We conducted a microcosm study to explore the responses of the non-target soil invertebrate Enchytraeus crypticus gut  and resistomes to copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) and copper nitrate by using bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons sequencing and high throughput quantitative PCR. The results showed that exposure to Cu resulted in higher bioaccumulation (P < 0.05) and lower body weight and reproduction (P < 0.05) of Enchytraeus crypticus than exposure to CuO NPs. Nevertheless, exposure to CuO NPs for 21 days markedly increased the alpha-diversity of the gut  of Enchytraeus crypticus (P < 0.05) and shifted the gut microbial communities, with a significant decline in the relative abundance of the phylum Planctomycetes (from 37.26% to 19.80%, P < 0.05) and a significant elevation in the relative abundance of the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Acidobacteria (P < 0.05). The number of detected ARGs in the Enchytraeus crypticus gut significantly decreased from 45 in the Control treatment to 16 in the Cu(NO) treatment and 20 in the CuO NPs treatment. The abundance of ARGs in the Enchytraeus crypticus gut were also significantly decreased to 38.48% when exposure to Cu(NO) and 44.90% when exposure to CuO NPs (P < 0.05) compared with the controls.

Some fungal species are commensal organisms that are part of the normal human , and, as such, do not pose a threat to the immune system. However, when the natural balance of this association is disturbed or the host's immune system is compromised, these fungal pathogens overtake the organism, and cause IFI. To understand the invasiveness of these pathogens and to address the growing problem of IFI, it is essential to identify the cellular processes of the invading organism and their virulence. In this review, we will discuss the prevalence and current options available to treat IFI, including recent reports of drug resistance. Nevertheless, the main focus of this review is to describe the glycobiology of human fungal pathogens and how various components of the fungal cell wall, particularly cell wall polysaccharides and glycoconjugates, are involved in fungal pathogenicity, their biosynthesis and how they can be potentially exploited to develop novel antifungal treatment options. We will specifically describe the nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) that are important in fungal survival and suggest that the inhibition of fungal NSTs may potentially be useful to prevent the establishment of fungal infections.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669313>Does the gut  contribute to the oligodendrocyte progenitor niche?</a></h1><p>The past decade has seen a growing number of studies on the relationship between the gut  and the brain.

We then review the factors impacting the composition of the child's gut , ranging from maternal stress to modality of delivery and from breastfeeding and diet composition to antibiotic treatment early in life. We discuss the topic of gut-brain communication with an emphasis on myelination, and propose the concept that gut microbes produce metabolites which may constitute a "metabolic" niche. Distinct bacterial communities may create very different "niches", some permissive and others inhibitory for myelin generation or maintenance. We speculate that this concept of "gut dysbiosis" may also in part explain the reduced myelin content detected in several neurological and psychiatric disorders.

The 23 proteins were shortlisted as novel druggable targets based on their role in pathogen-specific metabolic pathways, non-homologous to human and human gut  proteins and their druggability potential. Furthermore, potential chimeric vaccine constructs were generated from lead T and B-cell overlapped epitopes in combination with immune enhancer adjuvants and linkers sequences. The molecular docking and MD simulation analyses ensured stable molecular interaction of a finally prioritized vaccine construct with human immune cells receptors.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

For this study, raw yak milk, qula, and fermented yak milk samples were collected from the Aba Tibetan autonomous region of China. The genus and species microbial composition of these samples were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and groEL gene amplicons, and the volatile profile of the samples was quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results indicated variation in abundance of  at the genus level among the fermented yak milk samples, with Lactobacillus as the most abundant genus in the majority of samples, ranging from 41.6 to 98.26%. The volatile profile of the samples varied among those collected from different villages. Correlations between bacterial composition and volatile compounds of the samples were also observed. Lactobacillus displayed a significant correlation with volatile compounds such as benzaldehyde, 2,3-pentanedione, ethanol, and ethyl acetate, whereas the samples with relatively high abundance of Streptococcus and Lactococcus displayed relatively low contents of volatile compounds.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

The present study aims to assess the impact of a high fat diet on tuberculosis progression and  composition in an experimental animal model using a C3HeB/FeJ mouse strain submitted to single or multiple consecutive aerosol infections. These models allowed us to study the protection induced by Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination as well as by the natural immunity induced by chemotherapy after a low dose  infection. Our results show that a high fat diet is able to trigger a pro-inflammatory response, which results in a faster progression toward active tuberculosis and an impaired protective effect of BCG vaccination, which is not the case for natural immunity. This may be related to dysbiosis and a reduction in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the gut  caused by a decrease in the abundance of the Porphyromonadaceae family and, in particular, the  genus. It should also be noted that a high fat diet is also related to an increase in the genera , and , which have previously been related to dysbiotic processes. As diabetes mellitus type 2 is a risk factor for developing tuberculosis, these findings may prove useful in the search for new prophylactic strategies for this population subset.Copyright © 2019 Arias, Goig, Cardona, Torres-Puente, Díaz, Rosales, Garcia, Tapia, Comas, Vilaplana and Cardona.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667699>The lung : clinical and therapeutic implications.</a></h1><p>The human respiratory tract, usually considered sterile, is currently being investigated for human-associated microbial communities. According to Dickson's conceptual model, the lung  (LMt) is a dynamic ecosystem, whose composition, in healthy lungs, is likely to reflect microbial migration, reproduction, and elimination. However, which microbial genera constitutes a "healthy " per se remains hotly debated. It is now widely accepted that a bi-directional gut-lung axis connects the intestinal with the pulmonary  and that the diet could have a role in modulating both microbiotas as in health as in pathological status. The LMt is altered in numerous respiratory disorders such as obstructive airway diseases, interstitial lung diseases, infections, and lung cancer. Some authors hypothesize that the use of specific bacterial strains, termed "probiotics," with positive effects on the host immunity and/or against pathogens, could have beneficial effects in the treatment of intestinal disorders and pulmonary diseases. In this manuscript, we have reviewed the literature available on the LMt to delineate and discuss the potential relationship between composition alterations of LMt and lung diseases. Finally, we have reported some meaningful clinical studies that used integrated probiotics' treatments to contrast some lung-correlated disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678829>Drugging the gut : toward rational modulation of bacterial composition in the gut.</a></h1><p>The human gastrointestinal tract hosts almost a trillion microorganisms, organized in a complex community known as the gut , an integral part of human physiology and metabolism. Indeed, disease-specific alterations in the gut  have been observed in several chronic disorders, including obesity and inflammatory bowel diseases. Correcting these alterations could revert the development of such pathologies or alleviate their symptoms. Recently, the gut  has been the target of drug discovery that goes beyond classic probiotic approaches.

Previously, it was thought that C. difficile was primarily a hospital-acquired infection, however, with the emergence of community-associated cases, and whole-genome sequencing suggesting the majority of the hospital C. difficile infection (CDI) cases are genetically distinct from one another, there is compelling evidence that sources/reservoirs of C. difficile outside hospitals play a significant role in the transmission of CDI.To review the 'One Health' aspects of CDI, focusing on how community sources/reservoirs might be acting as a conduit in the transfer of C. difficile between animals and humans. The importance of a One Health approach in managing CDI is discussed.A literature search was performed on PubMed and Web of Science for relevant papers published from 01 January 2000 to 10 July 2019.We present evidence that demonstrates transmission of C. difficile in hospitals from asymptomatic carriers to symptomatic CDI patients. The source of colonization is most probably community reservoirs, such as foods and the environment, where toxigenic C. difficile strains have frequently been isolated. With high-resolution genomic sequencing, the transmission of C. difficile between animals and humans is likely despite a clear epidemiological link often being absent. The ways in which C. difficile from animals and humans can disseminate through foods and the environment are discussed; and an interconnected transmission pathway for C. difficile involving food animals, humans and the environment is presented.C. difficile is a well-established pathogen of both humans and animals that contaminates foods and the environment.

A relatively under-explored aspect of this is the role of gammaDelta (γδ) T cells, including prenatally and in the postnatal gut, which seem important hubs in driving the course of ASD.The present article looks at the role of γδ T cells in ASD, including via their interactions with other immune cells shown to be altered in this spectrum of conditions, including natural killer cells and mast cells.Other risk factors in ASD, such as decreased vitamins A & D, as well as toxin-associated activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor may also be intimately linked to γδ T cells, and alterations in the regulation of these cells. A growing body of data has highlighted an important role for alterations in mitochondria functioning in the regulation of immune cells, including natural killer cells and mast cells. This is an area that requires investigation in γδ T cells and their putative subtypes.It is also proposed that maternal stress may be acting via alterations in the maternal , leading to changes in how the balance of short chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, may act to regulate the placenta and developing foetus.

In our previous study, we found that the absence of gut  can influence the expression of microRNAs and mRNAs in the hippocampal region of the germ-free (GF) mice. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly being recognized as an important functional transcriptional regulator in the brain. In the present study, we aim to identify possible biological pathways and functional networks for lncRNA-associated transcript of the gut  in relation to the brain function. The profiles of lncRNA and mRNA from specific pathogen-free (SPF), colonized GF (CGF), and GF mice were generated using the Agilent Mouse LncRNA Array v2.0. Differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified, and lncRNA target genes were also predicted. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was performed to analyze related signaling pathways and biological functions associated with these dysregulated mRNAs and target genes. Validation with quantitative real-time PCR was performed on several key genes. Compared with SPF mice a total of 2230 DE lncRNAs were found in GF mice. Among these, 1355 were upregulated and 875 were downregulated. After comparing the target genes of DE lncRNAs with mRNA datasets, 669 overlapping genes were identified. IPA core analyses revealed that most of these genes were highly associated with cardiac hypertrophy, nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFAT) gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), calcium, and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling pathways. Additionally, mRNA expression levels of APP, CASP9, IGFBP2, PTGDS, and TGFBR2 genes that are involved in central nervous system functions were significantly changed in the GF mouse hippocampus.

In this study, we aim to investigate whether L-Arabinose could inhibit colitis by modulating gut . L-Arabinose was administrated in mice daily in a DSS-induced colitis model. The histological analysis, disease index and the expression of inflammatory genes were measured. 16S-rRNA sequence analysis was performed to investigate gut . Intriguingly, we found that L-Arabinose could repress DSS-induced colitis and inhibit p38-/p65-dependent inflammation activation. Besides that, our data revealed that L-Arabinose modulated gut  disturbed by DSS treatment. Additionally, by antibiotic treatment, the perturbed gut  was responsible for the suppressive effects of L-Arabinose on DSS-induced colitis. Lastly, Caco-2 cells was used to confirm the protective effects of L-Arabinose. As expected, the expression levels of pro-inflammatory proteins in Caco-2 cells treated with L-Arabinose in absence or presence of TNFα. Our work suggested that L-Arabinose exert anti-inflammation effect in DSS-induced colitis. These beneficial effects may be related to the diversity and composition of the gut  regulated by L-Arabinose.

In order to reveal the impact of non-surgical mechanical debridement therapy on microbial communities, we investigated the subgingival microbial communities of healthy implants and implants with peri-implantitis, both before and after the therapy.Subgingival plaques were collected from patients with healthy dental implants (HC; n = 10) and from patients with peri-implantitis (n = 13) before and after non-surgical mechanical debridement therapy. The treatment was conducted using curettes for submucosal debridement followed by irrigation with 0.2% (w/v) chlorhexidine, with re-examination 1 month later. 16S rRNA pyrosequencing was used to analyze the subgingival , and co-occurrence networks were adopted to explore the interactions between pathogens in the microbial communities.A total of 506 955 high-quality reads were generated, and 2222 operational taxonomic units were finally detected using a 97% similarity cutoff, with a mean of 249 ± 69 per sample. The peri-implantitis sites harbored similar microbial communities before and after the treatment, as demonstrated by the microbial diversity, relative abundance, and prevalence of bacteria. Most importantly, the microbial community structures were stable before and after non-surgical therapy based on the microbial diversity and bacterial composition, as well as the interactions between key pathogens, including Enterobacteriaceae, Selenomonas sputigena, Parvimonas, Eubacterium infirmum, Campylobacter gracilis, Tannerella forsythia, and Fusobacterium, which were measured using a co-occurrence network analysis. Periodontal pathogens were also detected in subgingival plaque after the treatment. Distinct microbial communities were found between the healthy and peri-implantitis sites.Our results demonstrate that non-surgical mechanical debridement therapy did not significantly affect the subgingival microbial communities in peri-implantitis, and the stable microbial networks created via interactions among pathogens may be responsible for the poor prognosis of peri-implantitis treatment.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, WGS for many pathogenic bacteria remain limited because they are difficult, slow and/or dangerous to culture. To avoid culturing, metagenomic sequencing can be performed directly on samples, but the sequencing effort required to characterize low frequency organisms can be expensive. Recently developed methods for selective whole genome amplification (SWGA) can enrich target DNA to provide efficient sequencing. We amplified Coxiella burnetii (a bacterial select agent and human/livestock pathogen) from 3 three environmental samples that were overwhelmed with host DNA. The 68- to 147-fold enrichment of the bacterial sequences provided enough genome coverage for SNP analyses and phylogenetic placement. SWGA is a valuable tool for the study of difficult-to-culture organisms and has the potential to facilitate high-throughput population characterizations as well as targeted epidemiological or forensic investigations.Copyright © 2018.

Since prevention of osteoporosis is important, it might act as a potential cofactor in osteoporosis prevention. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of VSEE on osteoporosis and abnormal lipid metabolisms.MC3T3-E1 cell and OVX rat model were used to evaluate VSEE on regulation of bone and lipid metabolisms. Differentiation and matrix mineralization of preosteoblast were significantly increased by VSEE (P <0.05), which attributed to stimulating calcium influx, then to activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and regulating runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osteoprotegerin (OPG). VSEE could cross Caco-2/HT-29 co-cultured monolayer via paracellular pathway and peptide transporter (PepT1), and could be detected in blood and maximum concentration was 122.84± 3.68 mg/L at 60 min.

Chain elongation processes based on microbiomes have been successfully developed to produce medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) from organic waste streams. Yet, the sustainability of chain elongation can still be improved by reducing the use of electron donors and additional chemicals. This work aimed to couple lactate production and subsequent chain elongation to decrease chemicals input such as electron donors and hydroxide for pH control in repeated-batch food waste fermentation. Food waste with adjusted pH was used as substrate and fermentation proceeded without pH control. During fermentation, lactate was first formed through the homolactic pathway and then converted to fatty acids (FA), mainly n-butyrate and n-caproate. The highest n-caproate carbon selectivities (mmol C/mmol C) and production rates were 38% and 4.2 g COD/L-d, respectively. Hydroxide input was reduced over time to a minimum of 0.47 mol OH/mol MCFA or 0.79 mol OH/kg COD. Lactate was a key electron donor for chain elongation and its conversion was observed at pH as low as 4.3. The  enriched in this work was dominated by Lactobacillus spp. and Caproiciproducens spp. The high abundance of Caproiciproducens spp. and their co-occurrence with Lactobacillus spp. suggest Caproiciproducens spp. used lactate as electron donor for chain elongation. This work shows the production of n-caproate from food waste with decreased use of hydroxide and no use of exogenous electron donors.Copyright © 2019.

Several sample types have been used to investigate the lung , each presenting specific challenges for preparation and analysis of microbial communities. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) enables the identification of  specific to the lower lung but commonly has low bacterial density, increasing the risk of false-positive signal from contaminating DNA. The objectives of this study were to investigate the extent of contamination across a range of sample densities representative of BALF and identify features of contaminants that facilitate their removal from sequence data and aid in the interpretation of BALF sample 16S sequencing data.Using three mock communities across a range of densities ranging from 8E+ 02 to 8E+ 09 16S copies/ml, we assessed taxonomic accuracy and precision by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the proportion of reads arising from contaminants. Sequencing accuracy, precision, and the relative abundance of mock community members decreased with sample input density, with a significant drop-off below 8E+ 05 16S copies/ml. Contaminant OTUs were commonly inversely correlated with sample input density or not reproduced between technical replicates. Removal of taxa with these features or physical concentration of samples prior to sequencing improved both sequencing accuracy and precision for samples between 8E+ 04 and 8E+ 06 16S copies/ml. For the lowest densities, below 8E+ 03 16S copies/ml BALF, accuracy and precision could not be significantly improved using these approaches. Using clinical BALF samples across a large density range, we observed that OTUs with features of contaminants identified in mock communities were also evident in low-density BALF samples.Relative abundance data and community composition generated by 16S sequencing of BALF samples across the range of density commonly observed in this sample type should be interpreted in the context of input sample density and may be improved by simple pre- and post-sequencing steps for densities above 8E+ 04 16S copies/ml.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680997>Simulated Weightlessness Perturbs the Intestinal Metabolomic Profile of Rats.</a></h1><p>Recently, disorders of intestinal homeostasis in the space environment have been extensively demonstrated.

However, the specific responses of intestinal metabolome under simulated weightlessness and its relationship with the intestinal  and immune characteristics remain largely unknown. In the current study, 20 adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into the control group and the simulated weightlessness group using a hindlimb unloading model. The metabolomic profiling of cecal contents from eight rats of each group was investigated by gas chromatography-time of flight/mass spectrometry. The significantly different metabolites, biomarkers, and related pathways were identified. Multivariate analysis, such as principal component analysis and orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis, demonstrated an obvious separation between the control group and the simulated weightlessness group. Significantly different metabolites, such as xylose, sinapinic acid, indolelactate, and digalacturonic acid, were identified, which participate in mainly pyrimidine metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and valine, leucine and isoleucine metabolism. Cytidine-5'-monophosphate, 4-hydroxypyridine, and phloretic acid were determined as pivotal biomarkers under simulated weightlessness. Moreover, the significantly different metabolites were remarkably correlated with dysbiosis of the intestinal  and disturbance of immunological characteristics induced by simulated weightlessness.

Painstaking research has led to the identification of a large number of different types of biomarkers, few of which are in general clinical use. Here, we searched for highly accurate combinations of biomarkers by meta-analyses of genome- and proteome-wide data from CRC tumors.

Alterations caused by the disease itself and the immune response, together with changes in the , are responsible for the higher frequency and severity of infections. During the infections, an increase in blood glucose occurs and usually an increase in insulin dose is required.The pediatric patient with diabetes will have elevated blood glucose during infections, with risk of decompensation. Therefore, blood glucose monitoring - as well as increased insulin doses -are critical to prevent the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis.

In patients with DT2, diabetic cardiomyopathy is a recognized cause of cardiac insufficiency secondary to chronic hyperglycaemia and myocardial lipotoxicity, which promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (and, frequently, apoptosis of these cells), interstitial fibrosis and a decrease in myocardial contractile performance. Several studies have shown that diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with modifications to the intestinal , and changes in the synthesis of bacterial metabolites and their diffusion into the host, some of which appear to have direct deleterious effects on cardiac contractility. These findings open up new perspectives for pathophysiological studies by establishing the presence of a '-myocardium' axis and raising the possibility of innovative new treatments.

The assay to measure D-, L-, and total lactate in canine fecal samples was linear, accurate, precise, and reproducible. Significant increases in fecal lactate and decreases in secondary BA concentrations were observed in dogs with CE and dogs with EPI. Dogs with EPI had an increased abundance of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium; a decreased abundance of Fusobacterium and Clostridium hiranonis; and a higher Dysbiosis Index when compared to healthy dogs. Further studies are necessary to determine the clinical utility of lactate and BA quantification in canine feces. These metabolites suggest functional alterations of intestinal dysbiosis and may become promising targets for further elucidating the role of the  in health and disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681281>Uterine Immunity and : A Shifting Paradigm.</a></h1><p>The female reproductive tract harbors distinct microbial communities, as in the vagina, cervical canal, uterus, and fallopian tubes. The nature of the vaginal  is well-known; in contrast, the upper reproductive tract remains largely unexplored. Alteration in the uterine , which is dependent on the nutrients and hormones available to the uterus, is likely to play an important role in uterine-related diseases such as hysteromyoma, adenomyosis, and endometriosis. Uterine mucosa is an important tissue barrier whose main function is to offer protection against pathogens and other toxic factors, while maintaining a symbiotic relationship with commensal microbes. These characteristics are shared by all the mucosal tissues; however, the uterine mucosa is unique since it changes cyclically during the menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy. The immune system, besides its role in the defense process, plays crucial roles in reproduction as it ensures local immune tolerance to fetal/paternal antigens, trophoblast invasion, and vascular remodeling. The human endometrium contains a conspicuous number of immune cells, mainly Natural Killers (NK) cells, which are phenotypically distinct from peripheral cytotoxic NK, cells and macrophages. The endometrium also contains few lymphoid aggregates comprising B cell and CD8 T cells. The number and the phenotype of these cells change during the menstrual cycle. It has become evident in recent years that the immune cell phenotype and function can be influenced by . Immune cells can sense the presence of microbes through their pattern recognition receptors, setting up host-microbe interaction. The  exerts an appropriately controlled defense mechanism by competing for nutrients and mucosal space with pathogens. It has recently been considered that uterus is a non-sterile compartment since it seems to possess its own . There has been an increasing interest in characterizing the nature of microbial colonization within the uterus and its apparent impact on fertility and pregnancy. This review will examine the potential relationship between the uterine  and the immune cells present in the local environment.Copyright © 2019 Agostinis, Mangogna, Bossi, Ricci, Kishore and Bulla.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672735>Whole-Genome Sequences of Five Strains of Kocuria rosea, NCTC2676, NCTC7514, NCTC7512, NCTC7528, and NCTC7511.</a></h1><p> is a Gram-positive coccus found in the environment and within normal human skin , and more recently, it has been potentially implicated as an opportunistic pathogen.

TRALI is one of the leading causes of transfusion-related fatalities and specific therapies are unavailable. Neutrophils are recognized as the major pathogenic cells, whereas T regulatory cells and dendritic cells appear to be important for protection against TRALI. The pathogenesis, however, is complex and incompletely understood. It is frequently postulated that the complement system plays an important role in the TRALI pathogenesis. In this article, we assess the evidence regarding the involvement of complement in TRALI from both human and animal studies. We hypothesize about the potential connection between the complement system and neutrophils in TRALI. Additionally, we draw parallels between TRALI and other acute pulmonary disorders of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome regarding the involvement of complement. We conclude that, even though a role for complement in the TRALI pathogenesis seems plausible, studies investigating the role of complement in TRALI are remarkably limited in number and also present conflicting findings. Different types of TRALI animal models, diverse experimental conditions, and the composition of the gastrointestinal  may perhaps all be factors which contribute to these discrepancies. More systematic studies are warranted to shed light on the contribution of the complement cascade in TRALI. The underlying clinical condition of the patient, which influences the susceptibility to TRALI, as well as the transfusion factor (antibody-mediated vs non-antibody-mediated), will be important to take into consideration when researching the contribution of complement. This should significantly increase our understanding of the role of complement in TRALI and may potentially result in promising new treatment strategies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To investigate the prebiotic effect of patchouli essential oil (PEO) and its derived compounds through the modulation of gut  (GM). C57BL/6J mice were treated with the PEO and three active components of PEO,  patchouli alcohol (PA), pogostone (PO) and β-patchoulene (β-PAE) for 15 consecutive days. Fecal samples and mucosa were collected for GM biomarkers studies. PEO, PA, PO, and β-PAE improve the gut epithelial barrier by altering the status of E-cadherin vs. N-cadherin expressions, and increasing the mucosal p-lysozyme and Muc 2. Moreover, the treatments also facilitate the polarization of M1 to M2 macrophage phenotypes, meanwhile, suppress the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Fecal microbial DNAs were analyzed and evaluated for GM composition by ERIC-PCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The GM diversity was increased with the treated groups compared to the control. Further analysis showed that some known short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, , , , , and  were significantly enriched in the treated groups. In addition, the key SCFAs receptors, GPR 41, 43 and 109a, were significantly stimulated in the gut epithelial layer of the treated mice. By contract, the relative abundance of pathogens  spp., , and  spp. were distinctly reduced by the treatments with PEO and β-PAE. Our findings provide insightful information that the /host dynamic interaction may play a key role for the pharmacological activities of PEO, PA, PO, and β-PAE.Copyright © 2019 Leong, Huang, Khan, Xia, Li, Liu, Li, Han, Su and Hsiao.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674783>Supplementation of Sesamin Alleviates Stress-Induced Behavioral and Psychological Disorders via Reshaping the Gut  Structure.</a></h1><p>Sesamin, a lignan from sesame seed, has been reported to attenuate chronic mild stress-induced depressive-like behaviors. Gut  play pivotal roles in mediating psychological behaviors by regulating gut barrier integrity and systemic inflammatory responses. Here, we found that oral sesamin administration (50 mg/kg·bodyweight/day) significantly attenuated depressive, aversive, repetitive, and anxiety-like behaviors in a long-term multiple nonsocial stress-treated mice model. Sesamin inhibited stress-induced gut barrier integrity damage, reduced circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, and suppressed neuroinflammatory responses. Moreover, sesamin treatment also restructured the gut  by enhancing the relative abundances of Bacteroidales and S24-7. The correlation analysis indicated that the  composition changes were strongly correlated with behavioral disorders, serotonin, norepinephrine, and LPS levels. In conclusion, sesamin has preventive effects on stress-induced behavioral and psychological disorders, which might be highly related to the reshaped  composition.

The HAP strain isolated from roach intestine was Enterococcus faecium strain CGMCC1.2136. The experiment was a simple completely randomized design and lasted for eight weeks. Two hundred and seventy fish with an average weight of 12 g randomly distributed into nine tanks. The trial consisted of three treatments with three respective replications. During the experimental period, fish received basal diet without any bacterial supplementation (as the control group), basal diet enriched with 10 CFU g HAP or 10 CFU g CP. At the end of the experiment, serum immune parameters of those fish fed HAP including alkaline phosphatase activity, total protein content, total immunoglobulin level, lysozyme activity and complement activity (ACH50) were significantly higher that other experimental groups (P < 0.05). Similarly, dietary supplementation of HAP resulted in better mucosal immune parameters in comparison to control group and commercial probiotic administration (P < 0.05). Intestinal heterotrophic bacteria and autochthonous LAB counts of those fish fed HAP were significantly higher than other experimental groups at the end of the experiment as well as 15 days seizing probiotic administrations (P < 0.05). Fish fed with HAP containing diet presented significantly higher amylase, lipase and protease activity in comparison to the CP fed fish and the control group (P < 0.05). Growth indices of those fish fed HAP were significantly higher than other treatments (P < 0.05). The highest carcass protein and ash content along with the lowest body moisture content belonged to those fish received HAP (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the use host-HAP resulted in better immune competence and growth performance and it seems aquaculture sector should probably focus on the development of probiotics isolated from the cultured species instead of using terrestrial probiotics with greatly different requirements and environmental conditions.Copyright © 2019.

Most members of the root  possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens [2]. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host immunity and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root , including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [5, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root . In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic acid and its derivative 2-keto gluconic acid. Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic acids and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic acid-mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root immunity. Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root , as it facilitates colonization by beneficial root .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal  were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/B index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate metabolism" were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and energy utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids (caproate, 2-methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic  to increase utilization of carbohydrates and energy, enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we investigated the effect of the culturable subset of soil microbial community (SMB) on the stress response of the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, upon exposure to one of the major soil contaminants, cadmium (Cd). Life history traits and the stress responses to Cd exposure were compared between SMB- and Escherichia coli strain OP50-fed worms. SMB-fed worms showed higher reproduction rates and longer lifespans. Also, the SMB-fed worms showed more tolerant response to Cd exposure. Gene expression profiling suggested that the chemical stress and immune response of worms were boosted upon SMB feeding. Finally, we investigated C. elegans gut microbial communities in the presence and absence of Cd in OP50- and SMB-fed C. elegans. In the OP50-fed worms, changes in microbial community by Cd exposure was severe, whereas in the SMB-fed worms, it was comparatively weak. Our results suggest that the SMB affects the response of C. elegans to Cd exposure and highlight the importance of the gut  in host stress response.Copyright © 2019.

We performed a systematic review using the PubMed/Medline database including primary articles written in English that measured leptin production or levels as well as SCFA used as an intervention, mechanism or outcome. The search yielded a total of 573 citations; 36 studies were included in the final analysis. The quality of the studies was analyzed through two validated tools based on objective criteria. Overall, the studies presented low risk of bias to construct and statistical validity. However, the majority presented a high risk of attrition and detection bias. In vitro studies (n = 8) consistently demonstrated that SCFA stimulate leptin expression in adipocytes through activation of free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3). In animal studies (n = 24), interventions to modulate high-fat diet outcomes predominantly caused a decrease in circulating leptin levels and increased SCFA, associated with suppressed weight gain. Control of dysbiosis through administration of prebiotics and probiotics also played a role in leptin synthesis in animal studies. In human studies (n = 4) leptin was mainly correlated with adiposity but dysbiosis interfered with this relationship. We conclude that the association between SCFA and leptin remains incompletely understood but occurs mainly through the activation of FFAR3 in adipocytes. However, body fat rather than SCFA remains the main driver for leptin synthesis in vivo. Future studies should aim to better clarify the role of SCFA in regulating leptin production in vivo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The dysbiosis promotes regulatory cell induction in the intestines and in the periphery, which suppresses contact sensitivity. Bacterial-derived signals promote regulatory cell induction both directly and indirectly by influencing the phenotype of dendritic cells (DC).Oral treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotic enrofloxacin was used to evaluate how gut flora perturbation shapes the immune response in the gut and the periphery.Enrofloxacin-induced dysbiosis creates an anti-inflammatory environment characterized by increased IL-10 concentration in the gut lumen and tissues. The production of IFN-γ and IL-17A did not change. Oral enrofloxacin treatment skewed the profile of the immune response towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype locally in small intestinal Peyer's Patches (PP) and systematically in the spleen (SPL). Enrofloxacin administration changed immune response in PP by increasing TGF-β secretion from an increased percentage of TGF-β-producing. In the SPL, enrofloxacin treatment increased the secretion of TGF-β and IL-10 and decreased the secretion of IL-17A and IFN-γ. The shift in cytokine profile correlated with a higher percentage of latency-associated peptide and IL-10-producing cells and a decreased percentage of IFN-γ-producing T cells. This anti-inflammatory immune response in the PP and SPL promoted a higher frequency of tolerogenic DC.Our data indicate that two-week enrofloxacin treatment induces dysbiosis, skews immune response towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype, and elevates secretion of TGF-β and IL-10 in the intestines and periphery. Additionally, we observed higher frequencies of tolerogenic DC, characterized by CD11b and IL-10 expression, which are known inducers of Treg cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, it is crucial to investigate farm management practices such as the bedding materials. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of recycled manure solids (RMS) as bedding material on bulk tank milk and microbiological implications for cheese quality. Bulk tank samples were collected from 84 dairy farms using RMS or straw bedding. The use of RMS did not influence thermophilic and mesophilic aerobic viable counts from spores. However, straw-milk samples gave higher values for mesophilic anaerobic spore-forming bacteria (0.44 log cfu/mL) than RMS-milk samples (0.17 log cfu/mL). The presence of thermoresistant lactic acid bacteria was not increased in milk from farms using RMS. Nevertheless, taxonomic profiles of thermoresistant bacteria isolated were different between the 2 types of milk. More Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus spp. were identified in RMS-milk samples. Thermoresistant enterococci and streptococci could easily end up in cheese. Therefore, milk proteolytic activities of these isolates were tested. Neither Streptococcus spp. nor Enterococcus faecium isolates exhibited proteolytic activities, whereas 53% of E. faecalis showed some. Also, only 1 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus was detected. Survival of selected RMS-milk samples isolates (3 E. faecalis and 1 Streptococcus thermophilus) was evaluated during a model Cheddar cheese manufacture. Although those strains survived well, they did not modify the acidification curve of milk.

Our objective was to investigate whether these dysbiotic bacteria act as pathobionts of T. vaginalis infection by altering pathogenic capabilities of the parasite, particularly in regard to adhesion to vaginal substrates and viability of human ectocervical cells. Assays interrogated the performance of T. vaginalis adhesion to biofilm produced by vaginal dysbiotic bacteria and whether these bacteria were capable of altering the ability of the parasite to bind to mucins and cells. The binding activities of T. vaginalis were quantified by flow cytometry. Host cell viability and apoptosis, as affected by T. vaginalis with or without the bacteria, were also measured experimentally. An in vitro biofilm was shown to provide adhesion for T. vaginalis. The binding of parasites to mucins and cells was modulated by the vaginal dysbiotic bacteria. Parasite cytoadhesion was significantly increased by these bacteria. In addition, these bacteria enhanced the pathogenic effects of the parasite to host cells.

The purpose of our study was to investigate the effects of omega-7-enriched Decaisnea insignis seed oil (DISO) on reducing TMAO formation to prevent the L-carnitine-induced hepatic damage in mice. Feeding of mice with 3% L-carnitine in drinking water clearly increased the serum and urinary levels of TMAO (p<0.05 vs Normal), whereas the serum and urinary TMAO formation was sharply reduced by DISO administration (p<0.05).

It is not necessarily more difficult to measure antimicrobial activity the traditional way, but it is, however, more laborious. In the present study, we developed a new method to measure the antimicrobial activity of LA in multiple samples with a microplate reader. A "test complex" (TC) was produced consisting of 100 μL of agar medium with LA in the bottom layer and 300 μL of broth in the top layer in 96-well deep-well microplates. Afterward, analysis of the broth in the top layer showed that the antimicrobial activity was the same as that of the "control complex," (CC) which consisted of 100 μL of agar medium in the bottom layer and 300 μL of broth with LA in the top layer. Furthermore, evaluation of the antimicrobial effect of the TC when using a microplate reader was the same as that with the use of the colony counting method. The colony counting method has confirmed that the antimicrobial activity of LA when bacteria are inoculated into the broth was equivalent between CC and TC, and we validated this by correlating the number of bacteria with absorbance. In addition, the broth itself in TC was transparent enough that the turbidity of broth can be used as an index of the number of bacteria, which enabled the use of a microplate reader for multiple samples.

The relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia, Bacteroidaceae, Bacteroides, and Akkermansia showed significant positive correlations with serum total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Additionally, the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae was positive with the level of HDL and the abundance of Rikenellaceae showed a negative relationship with the level of TG and LDL. Thirteen differentially expressed proteins were identified with P-value < 0.05. CXCL5, FGF2, and E-Selectin were significantly negatively associated with Akkermansia and Verrucomicrobia. Additionally, CXCL5 was significantly negatively correlated with Bacteroides and Bacteroidaceae. Three "cellular component" subcategories, 24 ″molecular function" subcategories, 752 ″biological process" subcategories and 29 statistically remarkable KEGG pathway categories were identified.Gut  changes of the mice having atherosclerosis and their relationship with the inflammatory status could be one of the major etiological mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2019.

This study investigated the effects of CYP on the intestinal  and gut defence barrier of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). Different groups of experimental fish were fed a normal control diet (NC), a low CYP diet (LYP) and a high CYP diet (HYP) for 8 weeks. After the feeding trial, the fish were assessed for intestinal enzyme activity, intestinal histology, immune-related gene expression, intestinal SCFAs and intestinal . Our results indicated that the intestinal integrity and antioxidant enzyme (CAT and SOD) activity in the common carp were enhanced following CYP supplementation. The mRNA levels of anti-inflammatory (TGF-β), tight binding protein (occludin and ZO-1) and pathway factor genes (TLR4 and NF-κB) were significantly upregulated in the HYP group (P＜0.05), which was accompanied by an increase in the level of pro-inflammatory IL-1β in the gut (P＜0.05). High-throughput sequencing revealed that Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes bacteria were most abundant in the microbial community in the gut of the common carp. The relative abundances of Bacteroides, Flavobacterium and Lactobacillus were increased, while the abundances of pathogenic microorganisms such as Enterobacteriaceae, Shewanella, Pseudomonas and Vibrio were reduced after treatment with CYP. Furthermore, the concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the gut were also increased (P＜0.05). Finally, our results revealed correlations between gut , SCFAs, non-specific immunity and antioxidant enzymes in CYP-fed carp. These results suggest that CYP-supplemented feed could improve the immunity of the common carp by modulating the intestinal microflora and enhancing the gut defence barrier and has the potential to be used as an immunostimulating feed additive in aquaculture.Copyright © 2019.

We sought to develop a three-dimensional gingivae-biofilm interface model using a commercially available gingival epithelium to study the tissue inflammatory response to oral biofilms associated with "health", "gingivitis" and "periodontitis". These biofilms were developed by sequential addition of microorganisms to mimic the formation of supra- and sub-gingival plaque in vivo. Secondly, to mimic the interactions between gingival epithelium and immune cells in vivo, we integrated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD14 monocytes into our three-dimensional model and were able to assess the inflammatory response in the immune cells cultured with and without gingival epithelium. We describe a differential inflammatory response in immune cells cultured with epithelial tissue, and more so following incubation with epithelium stimulated by "gingivitis-associated" biofilm. These results suggest that gingival epithelium-derived soluble mediators may control the inflammatory status of immune cells in vitro, and therefore targeting of the epithelial response may offer novel therapies.

Our previous studies have shown that exposure to GW chemicals resulted in altered  which was associated with damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release followed by neuro and gastrointestinal inflammation with loss of gut barrier integrity. Enteric glial cells (EGC) are emerging as important regulators of the gastrointestinal tract and have been observed to change to a reactive phenotype in several functional gastrointestinal disorders such as IBS and IBD. This study is aimed at investigating the role of dysbiosis associated EGC immune-activation and redox instability in contributing to observed gastrointestinal barrier integrity loss in GWI via altered tight junction protein expression. Using a mouse model of GWI and  studies with cultured EGC and use of antibiotics to ensure gut decontamination we show that exposure to GW chemicals caused dysbiosis associated change in EGCs. EGCs changed to a reactive phenotype characterized by activation of TLR4-S100β/RAGE-iNOS pathway causing release of nitric oxide and activation of NOX2 since gut sterility with antibiotics prevented this change. The resulting peroxynitrite generation led to increased oxidative stress that triggered inflammation as shown by increased NLRP-3 inflammasome activation and increased cell death. Activated EGCs  and  were associated with decrease in tight junction protein occludin and selective water channel aquaporin-3 with a concomitant increase in Claudin-2. The tight junction protein levels were restored following a parallel treatment of GWI mice with a TLR4 inhibitor SsnB and butyric acid that are known to decrease the immunoactivation of EGCs. Our study demonstrates that immune-redox mechanisms in EGC are important players in the pathology in GWI and may be possible therapeutic targets for improving outcomes in GWI symptom persistence.Copyright © 2019 Kimono, Sarkar, Albadrani, Seth, Bose, Mondal, Li, Kar, Nagarkatti, Nagarkatti, Sullivan, Janulewicz, Lasley, Horner, Klimas and Chatterjee.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666597>Metabolic and gut  changes following GLP-1 or dual GLP-1/GLP-2 receptor agonist treatment in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h1><p>Enteroendocrine L-cell derived peptide hormones, notably glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), have become important targets in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, obesity and intestinal diseases. As gut microbial imbalances and maladaptive host responses have been implicated in the pathology of obesity and diabetes, this study aimed to determine the effects of pharmacologically stimulated GLP-1 and GLP-2 receptor function on the gut  composition in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. DIO mice received treatment with a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist (liraglutide, 0.2 mg/kg, BID) or dual GLP-1/GLP-2 receptor agonist (GUB09-145, 0.04 mg/kg, BID) for 4 weeks. Both compounds suppressed caloric intake, promoted a marked weight loss, improved glucose tolerance and reduced plasma cholesterol levels. 16S rDNA sequencing and deep-sequencing shotgun metagenomics was applied for comprehensive within-subject profiling of changes in gut  signatures. Compared to baseline, DIO mice assumed phylogenetically similar gut bacterial compositional changes following liraglutide and GUB09-145 treatment, characterized by discrete shifts in low-abundant species and related bacterial metabolic pathways.

Disparities in CRC incidence and outcomes might result from differences in exposure to risk factors such as unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle; limited access to risk-reducing behaviors such as chemoprevention, screening, and follow up of abnormal test results; or lack of access to high-quality treatment resources. These factors operate at the individual, provider, health system, community, and policy levels to perpetuate CRC disparities. However, CRC disparities can be eliminated. Addressing the complex factors that contribute to development and progression of CRC with multicomponent, adaptive interventions, at multiple levels of the care continuum, can reduce gaps in mortality. These might be addressed with a combination of healthcare and community-based interventions and policy changes that promote healthy behaviors and ensure access to high-quality and effective measures for CRC prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Improving resources and coordinating efforts in communities where people of low-socioeconomic status live and work would increase access to evidence-based interventions. Research is also needed to understand the role and potential mechanisms by which factors in diet, intestinal , and/or inflammation contribute to differences in colorectal carcinogenesis.

The present study aimed to determine the effect of consumption of native chicory inulin on the stool frequency of middle-aged to older adults (40-75 years old) with uncomfortably but not clinically relevant low stool frequency, specified as two to four days without bowel movements per week. Two randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover trials were conducted using similar protocols in differing populations. Trial A was conducted in Amsterdam, The Netherlands and subsequently Trial B was conducted in Newcastle, United Kingdom. Both trials involved supplementation for 5 weeks with 10 g per day of inulin or placebo, a washout period of 2 weeks, and then crossed over to receive the other treatment. In Trial B, faecal gut  composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In Trial A, which 10 volunteers completed, the stool frequency was significantly increased to an average 4.9 ± 0.23 (SEM) times per week during inulin periods versus 3.6 ± 0.25 in the periods with placebo ( = 0.01). In contrast, in Trial B which 20 volunteers completed, there was no significant effect of the inulin on stool frequency (7.5 ± 2.1 times per week with inulin, 8.1 ± 3.0 with placebo,  = 0.35). However, many subjects in Trial B had a stool frequency >5 per week also for the placebo period, in breach of the inclusion criteria. Combining the data of 16 low stool frequency subjects from Trials A and B showed a significant effect of inulin to increase stool frequency from 4.1 to 5.0 per week ( = 0.032). Regarding secondary outcomes, stool consistency was significantly softer with inulin treatment compared to placebo periods, it increased 0.29 on the Bristol stool scale ( = 0.008) when data from all subjects of Trials A and B were combined. No other differences in bowel habit parameters due to inulin consumption were significant. None of the differences in specific bacterial abundance, alpha or beta diversity were significant, however the trends were in directions consistent with published studies on other types of inulin. We conclude that 10 g per day of native chicory inulin can increase stool frequency in subjects with low stool frequency.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665947> transplant therapy and autism: lessons for the clinic.</a></h1><p>: The purpose of this review is to discuss  Transplant Therapy (MTT), a type of intensive intestinal  transplantation (IMT), for people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and chronic gastrointestinal disorders (constipation and/or diarrhea).: This paper briefly reviews IMT, gastrointestinal symptoms and gastrointestinal bacteria in children with ASD, and results and lessons learned from intensive MTT for autism.: An open-label study and a two-year follow-up suggests that MTT is relatively safe and effective in significantly reducing gastrointestinal disorders and autism symptoms, changing the gut  structure, and increasing gut microbial diversity.

A nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway exists in which nitrate can be serially reduced to bioactive NO. The first step of this pathway occurs in the oral cavity where oral bacteria convert salivary nitrate to nitrite, whereafter nitrite is reduced to NO systemically by several enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways. Data are scarce regarding salivary levels and oral conversion capacity of these anions in infants. We measured salivary nitrate and nitrate in infants at 4 and 12 months of age and related values to age, sex, dietary pattern and oral . Saliva was collected from a total of 188 infants at 4 and 12 months of age. Salivary nitrate, nitrite and nitrite/nitrate ratio as a measure of oral nitrate-reducing capacity were analyzed by HPLC and related to age, sex, type of diet (breast milk or formula) and oral . There was no difference in salivary nitrate, nitrite or nitrite/nitrate ratio between boys and girls at any age. At 4 months levels of these parameters were lower than what has been described in adults but they had all increased significantly at 12 months of age. At 4 months of age salivary nitrite/nitrate ratio was lower in breast-fed compared to formula-fed infants, but these differences disappeared at 12 months. Several bacterial species were associated with oral nitrate reducing capacity including Prevotella, Veillonella, Alloprevotella and Leptotrichia. We conclude that in infants there is an increase in salivary nitrate and nitrite as well as in oral nitrate-reductase capacity during the first year of life. Differences observed at 4 months of age between breast-fed and formula-fed infants disappear at one year of age.Copyright © 2019.

Although the exact mechanisms underlying the initial development of IBD are not fully understood, it is believed that an abnormal immune response is elicited against the intestinal  in genetically predisposed individuals. Crucial elements of the etiopathogenesis have been elucidated by research using human biological materials. The estimated prevalence of IBD is 0.5% in the Western world. Although incidence rates are increasing, both conditions are not "common" in general terms mandating a multicentric approach. Biological material from numerous Belgian patients have been collected over time in a number of university hospitals in Belgium (UH Ghent: 800 CD patients, 350 UC patients, 600 normal controls; UH Leuven: 2,600 CD patients, 1,380 UC patients, 98 IC/IBDU patients, 6,260 normal controls). Within the setting of the Flemish Center Medical Innovation (CMI) initiative and later on the Flemish biobank network a prospective study was set-up across three Belgian IBD centers (University Hospitals Brussels, Ghent, and Leuven). Human biological materials and data have been collected prospectively from newly diagnosed CD and UC patients. The analyses hereof have generated new insights which have been published in the most renowned journals. The approach of well-thought off, multi-centric, structured, and systematic biobanking has proven to be a success-story and thus a textbook case for multi-centric banking of human biological materials.

(R)-salbutamol significantly inhibited LPS-induced M1 macrophage polarization and downregulated expressions of typical M1 macrophage cytokines, including monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Also, (R)-salbutamol significantly decreased the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), while increasing the reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio. In contrast, (S)-salbutamol increased the production of NO and ROS. Bioenergetic profiles showed that (R)-salbutamol significantly reduced aerobic glycolysis and enhanced mitochondrial respiration. Untargeted metabolomics analysis demonstrated that (R)-salbutamol modulated metabolic pathways, of which three metabolic pathways, namely, (a) phenylalanine metabolism, (b) the pentose phosphate pathway and (c) glycerophospholipid metabolism were the most noticeably impacted pathways. The effects of (R)-salbutamol on M1 polarization were inhibited by a specific β receptor antagonist, ICI-118551. These findings demonstrated that (R)-salbutamol inhibits the M1 phenotype by downregulating aerobic glycolysis and glycerophospholipid metabolism, which may propose (R)-salbutamol as the major pharmacologically active component of racemic salbutamol for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and highlight the medicinal value of (R)-salbutamol.© 2019 The Authors.

This non-specific response to reinfection is a primitive form of adaptation that has been shown to be conserved from plants to mammals. Insects lack an acquired immune component and rely solely on an innate one, and they have expanded it upon traits of plasticity and adaptation against pathogens in the form of immune priming. The recent discoveries of the role of  in the insect's ecology and the ability of this yeast to induce trained immunity in different organisms suggest that insects could have developed mechanisms of adaptation and immune enhancing. Here, we report that two yeast strains of , previously shown to induce trained immunity in mammals, enhance resistance to  infection in the paper wasp . The reduction of injected  load by  strains was statistically significant in future foundresses but not in workers, and this occurs before and after hibernation.

However, the underlying mechanism of IBS is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate potential mechanism and novel biomarkers of IBS through evaluation of the metabolomic and microbiologic profile.  Fecal samples were collected from 15 irritable bowel syndrome patients and 15 healthy controls. By using gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) and 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, fecal metabolites and  of healthy controls and the IBS patients were measured.  IBS patients had a significantly differential metabolite profile as compared to healthy controls, and 4 clusters with 31 metabolites, including a group of amino acids and fatty acids, were significantly up-regulated as compared to the healthy controls. In addition, 19 microbes were significantly up-regulated, and 12 microbes were down-regulated in the IBS group, when compared with the healthy controls. Some clusters of fecal metabolites or microorganisms were significantly correlated with the severity of IBS symptoms, such as the frequency of abdominal pain/discomfort and the number of bowel movements. Correlation of the metabolite levels with abundances of microbial genera showed some statistically significant metabolite-microbe associations. Four differentially abundant amino acids clustered together were positively correlated with some microbes, including , and so on.  The finding of this study puts a global perspective on metabolomics and  profiling in IBS patients and provides a theoretical basis for future research on pathophysiology of IBS.Copyright © 2019 Zhu, Liu, Li, Zhang, Zhang, Chen, Zhao, Chen, Gu, Min and Zhang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682463>Alterations in Oral  in HIV are Related to Decreased Pulmonary Function.</a></h1><p>Mechanisms of HIV-associated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are poorly understood. The oral  shapes the lung  and gut dysbiosis can impact lung diseases; however, relationships of the oral and gut  to COPD in HIV have not been explored.To examine alterations in the oral and gut  associated with pulmonary disease in persons with HIV (PWH).75 PWH and 93 HIV-uninfected men from the Multicenter AIDS cohort study performed pulmonary function testing. Sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA in saliva and stool was performed. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling, permutational multivariate analysis of variance and linear discriminant analysis to analyze communities by HIV and lung function.Oral  composition differed by HIV and smoking status. Alterations of oral microbial communities were observed in PWH with abnormal lung function with increases in relative abundance of Veillonella, Streptococcus and Lactobacillus. There were no significant associations between the oral  and lung function in HIV-uninfected individuals. No associations with HIV status or lung function were seen with the gut .Alterations of oral  in PWH were related to impaired pulmonary function and to systemic inflammation. These results suggest that the oral  may serve as a biomarker of lung function in HIV and that its disruption may contribute to COPD pathogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680937>Neuroinflammation and the Gut : Possible Alternative Therapeutic Targets to Counteract Alzheimer's Disease?</a></h1><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multi-factorial disease affecting various brain systems. This complexity implies that successful therapies must be directed against several core neuropathological targets rather than single ones. The scientific community has made great efforts to identify the right AD targets beside the historic amyloid-β (Aβ). Neuroinflammation is re-emerging as determinant in the neuropathological process of AD. A new theory, still in its infancy, highlights the role of gut  (GM) in the control of brain development, but also in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Bidirectional communication between the central and the enteric nervous systems, called gut-brain axes, is largely influenced by GM and the immune system is a potential key mediator of this interaction. Growing evidence points to the role of GM in the maturation and activation of host microglia and peripheral immune cells. Several recent studies have found abnormalities in GM (dysbiosis) in AD populations. These observations raise the intriguing question whether and how GM dysbiosis could contribute to AD development through action on the immune system and whether, in a therapeutic prospective, the development of strategies preserving a healthy GM might become a valuable approach to prevent AD. Here, we review the evidence from animal models and humans of the role of GM in neuroinflammation and AD.Copyright © 2019 Cerovic, Forloni and Balducci.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666478>Japanese Diet Score Is Associated with Gut  Composition in Young Japanese Adults.</a></h1><p>The Japanese diet (JD) is accepted as a healthy dietary pattern, which has protective effects against cancer and cardiovascular diseases. However, it remains unclear whether there is any association between the JD and fecal  composition. This cross-sectional study examined the relationship between JD scores and fecal  in young Japanese adults, through the analysis of fecal  using the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) method. JD scores were calculated with regard to nine food groups (rice, miso soup, pickles, green and yellow vegetables, seaweeds, fish, green tea, meat, and coffee) based on a brief self-administered diet-history questionnaire. JD total scores were categorized as low (score 0-3) or high (score 4-8). The high-scoring JD group exhibited a significantly higher relative abundance of Bacteroides than the low JD group, whereas the low JD group exhibited a significantly higher relative abundance of Prevotella than the high JD group. With regard to food group intakes, a higher consumption of rice was associated with a significantly lower relative abundance of Prevotella, whereas a higher consumption of green tea was associated with a significantly higher relative abundance of Bifidobacterium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating an association between JD score and fecal  and may allow the prediction of changes in fecal  due to changes in the JD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674054>Long-term impact of tylosin on fecal  and fecal bile acids of healthy dogs.</a></h1><p>Tylosin is commonly prescribed to dogs with diarrhea.

We report a cross-sectional analysis of 1674 participants from four centers of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), aged 18 to 74 years old at recruitment.Amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA gene V4 and fungal ITS1 fragments from self-collected stool samples indicate that the host  is determined by sociodemographic and migration-related variables. Those who relocate from Latin America to the USA at an early age have reductions in Prevotella to Bacteroides ratios that persist across the life course. Shannon index of alpha diversity in fungi and bacteria is low in those who relocate to the USA in early life. In contrast, those who relocate to the USA during adulthood, over 45 years old, have high bacterial and fungal diversity and high Prevotella to Bacteroides ratios, compared to USA-born and childhood arrivals. Low bacterial diversity is associated in turn with obesity. Contrasting with prior studies, our study of the Latino population shows increasing Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio with greater obesity.

We investigated if the dietary minerals interact with the gut  to alter circulating lipid profiles, implicated in CVD and metabolic syndrome.Plasma samples from Wistar rats fed a control or HNaLK diet with or without antibiotic treatment (n = 7 each, a total of 28) were subjected to lipidomics analysis. Lipidomic data were then analyzed using various statistical and bioinformatics tools, which detected numerous lipid species altered by the treatments, and consistently demonstrated interactions between the gut  and the HNaLK diet in altering circulating lipids, mainly triglycerides (TGs). We identified two distinct TG groups, differentially regulated by antibiotic treatment. One group (cluster 1), representing the majority of TG species detected, was downregulated, whereas the other group (cluster 2) was upregulated by antibiotic treatment. Interestingly, cluster 2 TGs were also regulated by the diet. Cluster 2 TGs exhibited greater carbon-chain length and double-bond content and included TGs composed of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, previously associated with reduced diabetes risk.The HNaLK diet interacts with gut bacteria to alter plasma lipid profiles, which may be related to its health effects.

Pathogenic filamentous oomycetes of the genus  comprises more than 150 recognized species and cause highly destructive soil-borne diseases in deciduous trees crops worldwide. Moreover, the treatment of soil  with amino acids is an alternative strategy to achieve desirable effects even against phytopathogenic oomycetes. In our study, samples from rhizosphere soil were collected either from naturally -infected trees, from completely asymptomatic ones, or from trees as above subjected also to treatments with amino acids (Amino16®) under different fertilization regimes. The interactions of bacterial communities with plant pathogenic oomycetes are crucial to determine the course of infection and the pathogenicity encompassing various functional contexts like biofilm formation. Thus, for deciphering the structure and diversity of these soil bacterial communities, we applied a 16S rRNA Illumina sequencing approach targeting the V3-V4 gene region.

Within these niches, the soft rot  (SRE) represents an emerging group of plant-pathogens causing soft rot/blackleg diseases resulting in economic losses worldwide in a variety of crops. A preliminary screening using next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA comparatively analyzing healthy and diseased potato tubers, identified several taxa from  to  as potential potato endophytes/plant pathogens. Subsequent to this, a range of molecular and computational techniques were used to determine the contribution of antimicrobial factors such as bacteriocins, carbapenem and type VI secretion system (T6SS), found in an aggressive SRE ( subsp.  strain PBR1692 - 1692) against these endophytes/plant pathogens. The results showed growth inhibition of several  by 1692 depends either on carbapenem or pyocin production. Whereas for targeted , only the 1692 pyocin seems to play a role in growth inhibition. Furthermore, production of carbapenem by 1692 was observably dependent on the presence of environmental iron and oxygen. Additionally, upon deletion of , A and I regulators, carbapenem production ceased, implying a complex regulatory mechanism involving these three genes. Finally, the results demonstrated that although T6SS confers no relevant advantage during  competition, a significant attenuation in competition by the mutant strain lacking a functional T6SS was observed .Soft rot  (SRE) represents important phytopathogens causing soft rot/blackleg diseases in a variety of crops leading to huge economic losses worldwide. These pathogens have been isolated alongside other bacteria from different environments such as potato tubers, stems, roots and from the soil. In these environments, SREs coexist with other bacteria where they have to compete for scarce nutrients and other resources. In this report, we show that  subsp.  strain PBR1692 - 1692, which represents one of the SREs, inhibits growth of several different bacteria by producing different antimicrobial compounds. These antimicrobial compounds can be secreted inside or outside the plant host, allowing 1692 to effectively colonize different types of ecological niches. By analyzing the genome sequences of several SREs, we show that other SREs likely deploy similar antimicrobials to target other bacteria.Copyright © 2019 Shyntum, Nkomo, Shingange, Gricia, Bellieny-Rabelo and Moleleki.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678900>Bile acid abnormality induced by intestinal dysbiosis might explain lipid metabolism in Parkinson's disease.</a></h1><p>Intestinal dysbiosis refers to an imbalance in the intestinal flora. The concept of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), a condition of abnormal proliferation of the small intestine , has been proposed as a form of small intestine dysbiosis. In Parkinson's disease patients, weight loss and metabolic disorders such as lipid abnormalities are frequently encountered. This was a prospective investigation of the presence of SIBO using the lactulose breath test, Parkinson's disease symptoms, medications, abdominal symptoms, and blood data involving 39 Parkinson's disease patients. Of the 39 patients, 19 were positive for SIBO, 16 were negative, and 4 were equivocal. SIBO-positive patients had a significantly smaller dopaminergic drug load (dopamine replacement of Parkinson's disease drug potency) (P = 0.009) and significantly lower serum triglyceride (TG) (P = 0.024) and total bilirubin (P = 0.019) levels. No relationship was seen between the presence or absence of SIBO and motor or abdominal symptoms. The following hypothesis was developed with regard to the possibility that intestinal bacterial overgrowth has various effects that are exhibited via bile acid metabolism in Parkinson's disease patients. Serum bilirubin levels become higher as bilirubin metabolism declines with decreases in the intestinal bacteria. At the same time, bile acid is broken down due to increased intestinal bacteria, and lipid absorption decreases. This induces low serum TG levels and leads to weight loss. By a similar mechanism, there is less absorption of vitamin D as bile acid levels decrease, leading to osteoporosis and fractures. The possibility that some of the non-motor manifestations accompanying Parkinson's disease are caused by intestinal dysbiosis needs to be considered.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

All subjects had been treated for any dental caries or periodontal disease with all restorative treatment completed at least 1 year ago and had ≤3 residual pockets. They were categorized based on a past diagnosis of chronic periodontitis into "healthy" (H) or "periodontitis" (P) categories. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected, genomic DNA was isolated, and high throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA (V3-V4) gene amplicons was performed. The sequences were assigned taxonomy at the species level by using a BLASTN based algorithm that used a combined reference database of HOMD RefSeqV14.51, HOMD RefSeqExtended V1.1 and GreenGeneGold. Species-level OTUs were subjected to downstream analysis in QIIME and R.

Determining the taxonomic origin of microbial sequences is one of the first, and frequently only, analysis performed on  samples. Substantial research has focused on the development of methods for taxonomic annotation, often making trade-offs in computational efficiency and classification accuracy. A side-effect of these efforts has been a reexamination of the bacterial taxonomy itself. Taxonomies developed prior to the genomic revolution captured complex relationships between organisms that went beyond uniform taxonomic levels such as species, genus, and family. Driven in part by the need to simplify computational workflows, the bacterial taxonomies used most commonly today have been regularized to fit within a standard seven taxonomic levels. Consequently, modern analyses of microbial communities are relatively coarse-grained. Few methods make classifications below the genus level, impacting our ability to capture biologically relevant signals. Here, we present ATLAS, a novel strategy for taxonomic annotation that uses significant outliers within database search results to group sequences in the database into partitions. These partitions capture the extent of taxonomic ambiguity within the classification of a sample. The ATLAS pipeline can be found on GitHub [https://github.com/shahnidhi/outlier_in_BLAST_hits]. We demonstrate that ATLAS provides similar annotations to phylogenetic placement methods, but with higher computational efficiency. When applied to human  data, ATLAS is able to identify previously characterized taxonomic groupings, such as those in the class  and the genus . Furthermore, the majority of partitions identified by ATLAS are at the subgenus level, replacing higher-level annotations with specific groups of species. These more precise partitions improve our detection power in determining differential abundance in  association studies.Copyright © 2019 Shah, Meisel and Pop.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677982>Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes levels in gut  and effects of hosts TLR2/TLR4 gene expression levels in adult type 1 diabetes patients in Istanbul, Turkey.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to determine and compare the levels of both Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in the gut  and TLR2/TLR4 gene expression in the blood of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and healthy individuals.

After exposure, motor and memory behavior, and the composition of the fecal  and plasma metabolome were measured. Memory potential was significantly reduced in mice exposed to continuous light, whereas rotarod performance was minimally affected. The overall composition of the  was relatively constant over time. However,  was relatively more abundant in mice exposed to continuous dark, while  was relatively more abundant in mice exposed to continuous light.

While the diversity of phages in gut ecosystems is getting increasingly well characterized, knowledge is limited how phages contribute to the evolution and ecology of their host bacteria. Here, we show that biologically active prophages are widely distributed in phylogenetically diverse strains of the gut symbiont  Nearly all human- and rodent-derived strains, but less than half of the tested strains of porcine origin, contain active prophages, suggesting different roles of phages in the evolution of host-specific lineages. To gain insight into the ecological role of  phages, we developed strain  6475 as a model to study its phages. After administration to mice,  6475 produces active phages throughout the entire intestinal tract, with the highest number detected in the distal colon. Inactivation of  abolished  phage production, which suggests that activation of the SOS response drives phage production in the gut. In conventional mice, phage production reduces bacterial fitness as fewer wild-type bacteria survive gut transit compared to the mutant lacking prophages. However, in gnotobiotic mice, phage production provides  with a competitive advantage over a sensitive host. Collectively, we uncovered that the presence of prophages, although being associated with a fitness trade-off, can be advantageous for a gut symbiont by killing a competitor strain in its intestinal niche. Bacteriophages derived from lysogens are abundant in gut microbiomes. Currently, mechanistic knowledge is lacking on the ecological ramifications of prophage carriage yet essential to explain the abundance of lysogens in the gut. An extensive screen in the bacterial gut symbiont  revealed that biologically active prophages are widely distributed in this species. In strain  6475, phages are produced throughout the intestinal tract but phage production is associated with reduced fitness of the lysogen. However, phage production provides a competitive advantage in direct competition with a non-lysogenic strain of  that is sensitive to these phages. This combination of increased competition with a fitness trade-off provides a potential explanation for the domination of lysogens in gut ecosystem and how lysogens can co-exist with sensitive hosts.Copyright © 2019 Oh et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681230>Phylogeography and Ecological Niche Shape the Cichlid Fish Gut  in Central American and African Lakes.</a></h1><p>Cichlid fishes, with their repeated colonization of lakes and subsequent radiations at different scales of phylogenetic and ecological diversification, offer an excellent model system to understand the factors shaping the host-gut  association in nature. Here, we characterized the gut  of the  species complex from Central America (known as the Midas cichlid complex), encompassing 158 wild specimens (13 species) collected from seven Nicaraguan lakes, and combined these data with previously published data from two African lakes (spanning 29 species). Our aim was to comprehensively explore trends in  variation and persistence along the large spatial and temporal scales of cichlid diversification (from the oldest radiation in L. Tanganyika, 9-12 My old, to young ones in Nicaraguan crater lakes, <0.5 My old), in allopatry and sympatry (within and across lakes), and across the range of dietary niches (from highly specialized to generalist feeders). Despite their extraordinary diversity, cichlids shared a remarkably conserved microbial taxonomic profile, which argues for a primary role of the host genetics in the assembly and maintenance of these microbial communities. Within this partly constrained  profile, geographic isolation (continent and lake) represented the first level of discrimination. For the Midas cichlid, a partial congruency was found between host  and genetic distances, suggesting that microbial communities have partly diversified along their cichlid phylogeographic history of crater lake colonization. In sympatry (within lakes), the young and poorly ecologically diversified cichlid assemblages of Central American lakes display largely unresolved gut microbiotas (in terms of both alpha and beta diversities), whereas the phylogenetically and ecologically diverse species found in African lakes showed greater microbial interspecific diversity. This pattern largely points to the level of habitat segregation, trophic niche overlap, and reproductive barriers as major modulators of the gut  connectivity among sympatric species.Copyright © 2019 Baldo, Riera, Salzburger and Barluenga.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664519>Dietary intervention using (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a fungus-derived soluble prebiotic ameliorates high-fat diet-induced metabolic distress and alters beneficially the gut  in mice model.</a></h1><p>Western diet, rich in carbohydrates and fat, is said to be a major factor underlying metabolic syndrome. Interventions with prebiotics, the key modulators of the gut , have paramount impact on host-associated metabolic disorders. Herein, we investigated the effect of fungus-derived (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a highly soluble dietary fiber, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic distress.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with different diet groups (n = 11): control diet, HFD, 3 g/kg or 5 g/kg of β-glucan-incorporated HFD. At the end of experimental study period (12th week), body weight, feces weight and fecal moisture content were observed. Further, colonic motility was measured using activated charcoal meal study. Proteins extracted from liver and intestine tissues were subjected to western blot technique. Paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned for histochemical [Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB) staining] analysis. Fecal  analysis was performed using MOTHUR bioinformatic software.β-glucan consumption exhibited anti-obesity property in mice groups fed with HFD. In addition, β-glucan ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic stress, colonic motility and intestinal atrophy (reduction in colon length, goblet cells, and mucosal layer thickness). Further, β-glucan incorporation shifted bacterial community by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaerostipes, Coprobacillus, and Roseburia and decreasing reportedly obesity-associated bacteria such as Parabacteroides and Lactococcus.Altogether, the outcomes of this present pre-clinical animal study show β-glucan to be a promising therapeutic candidate in the treatment of HFD-induced metabolic distress. Further comprehensive research has to be conducted to brace its clinical relevance, reproducibility and efficacy for aiding human health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678050>The Role of the Gut  in Colorectal Cancer: Where Are We?

Intestinal dysbiosis plays a key role in the development of colorectal cancer. In the process of carcinogenesis, inflammation, immune response, and toxic metabolites play a significant role. Specific species of bacteria might affect the risk of colorectal cancer and growth of tumor already present. Assessment of changes in the intestinal  during the development and progression of colorectal cancer might create a simple diagnostic tool, a useful biomarker, or might influence treatment strategies in colorectal cancer patients.

In this study, we assessed the bacterial composition of the rectal  associated with CT and/or NG infections in a cohort of men reporting unsafe rectal intercourse. A total of 125 rectal swabs were collected and four groups were compared: non-infected subjects ( = 53), patients with CT ( = 37), or NG rectal infection ( = 17) and patients with contemporary positivity for CT/NG ( = 18). CT and NG infections were detected by a real-time commercial test and the rectal  composition was analyzed from rectal swabs through sequencing of the hypervariable V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. The rectal  of all subgroups was dominated by , and  families. Irrespective of the analyzed subgroup, we found that the rectal environment of all the enrolled MSM was rich in  and  genera. Moreover, a shift in the bacterial composition between patients with sexually transmitted rectal infections and controls was noticed: infected patients were characterized by a depletion of  species, associated with an increase of anaerobic genera, including , and . Overall, the presence of rectal symptoms did not significantly modify the rectal  profiles among the four groups of analyzed patients. We confirmed that HIV-positive patients are characterized by a lower bacterial richness than HIV-negative subjects. However, we found that the presence of HIV has a different impact on bacterial rectal communities compared to CT and NG infections, modifying the relative abundance of several genera, including , and . Information about the rectal  composition in CT and NG infections could shed light on the pathogenesis of these conditions and could contribute to the onset of new strategies for their control.Copyright © 2019 Ceccarani, Marangoni, Severgnini, Camboni, Laghi, Gaspari, D'Antuono, Foschi, Re and Consolandi.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672964>Theabrownin from Pu-erh tea attenuates hypercholesterolemia via modulation of gut  and bile acid metabolism.</a></h1><p>Pu-erh tea displays cholesterol-lowering properties, but the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. Theabrownin is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea. Here, we show that theabrownin alters the gut  in mice and humans, predominantly suppressing microbes associated with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Theabrownin increases the levels of ileal conjugated bile acids (BAs) which, in turn, inhibit the intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling pathway, resulting in increased hepatic production and fecal excretion of BAs, reduced hepatic cholesterol, and decreased lipogenesis. The inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling is accompanied by increased gene expression of enzymes in the alternative BA synthetic pathway, production of hepatic chenodeoxycholic acid, activation of hepatic FXR, and hepatic lipolysis. Our results shed light into the mechanisms behind the cholesterol- and lipid-lowering effects of Pu-erh tea, and suggest that decreased intestinal BSH microbes and/or decreased FXR-FGF15 signaling may be potential anti-hypercholesterolemia and anti-hyperlipidemia therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667416>A new method for extracting DNA from the grape berry surface, beginning in the vineyard.</a></h1><p>Isolating DNA from microbes on the surface of a grape berry is a challenge due to their adhesion to the thick berry skin and cuticle, making studies of the grape  challenging.

Probiotics are used as potential alternatives to antibiotics to prevent NE. It is known that  can act as a probiotic that can prevent infection. However, whether or not it exerts a beneficial effect on NE in chickens remains elusive. Therefore, we investigated the impact of  on immune response and intestinal  during the development of NE in chickens, including experimental stages with basal diets, high-fishmeal-supplementation diets, and  challenge. Chickens were divided into two groups from day 1 to day 20: one group had its diet supplemented with  supplementation and one did not. At day 20, the chickens were divided into four groups:  challenged and unchallenged chickens with and without  supplementation. All groups were fed a basal diet for 13 days and thereafter a basal diet with 50% fishmeal from day 14 to 24. Chickens were infected with  from day 21 to 23. At days 13, 20 and 24, samples were collected for analysis of the relative expression of immune response and intestinal mucosa barrier-related genes and intestinal microbes. The results show that  can inhibit the increase in IL-17A gene expression and the reduction in Claudin-1 gene induced-expression caused by  challenge. Moreover,  was found to increase the expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 in infected chickens. Although  was found to have a significant beneficial effect on the structure of intestinal bacteria in the basal diet groups and decrease the abundance of  in the gut, it did not significantly affect the occurrence of intestinal lesions and did not significantly correct the shift in gut bacterial composition post  infection. In conclusion, although  promotes the expression of anti-inflammatory and tight junction protein genes and inhibits pro-inflammatory genes in challenged chickens, it is not adequate to improve the structure of intestinal  in NE chickens. Therefore, more effective schemes of  supplementation to prevent and treat NE in chickens need to be identified.Copyright © 2019 Huang, Peng, Gao, Wei, Xiang, Yuan and Xu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665573>Fecal  Transplantation for Dysbiosis - Predictable Risks.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670354>Whole barley prevents obesity and dyslipidemia without the involvement of the gut  in germ free C57BL/6J obese mice.</a></h1><p>Whole barley (WB) consumption is the subject of renewed interest because of its health benefits. However, there are still controversies regarding the mechanisms of the anti-obesity effects of WB. The gut  has recently become a focus of research into obesity-related disorders. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of the gut  to the anti-obesity effects of WB. Germ-free (GF) C57BL/6J mice underwent gastric inoculation with human feces to obtain human flora-associated (HFA) mice, and then both the GF and HFA mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) containing 46% WB or refined barley for 9 weeks. Features of obesity and dyslipidemia were compared between the GF and HFA mice and the cecal  was analyzed using next-generation sequencing of microbial 16S rRNA. WB prevents obesity and hypercholesterolemia in the GF and HFA mice. The mechanism may include the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, because sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA) expression was downregulated, and a reduction in cholesterol accumulation, because cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) expression was upregulated, independent of the gut . Furthermore, WB intake enriched a variety of bacterial genera that are negatively associated with obesity, including Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Clostridium cluster XIVa, suggesting that WB counteracted gut dysbiosis in obese mice. Thus, WB helps prevent obesity and dyslipidemia via both gut -dependent and independent mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675589>Effects of cadmium on intestinal histology and  in freshwater crayfish (Procambarus clarkii).</a></h1><p>In this study, Procambarus clarkii (P. clarkii) were exposed to different concentrations (0, 2, 5 and 10 mg/L) of cadmium (Cd). We studied the effects of Cd exposure on intestinal histology and  in P. clarkii. The results demonstrated that exposure to Cd caused histological alterations in the intestines of P. clarkii. Meanwhile, high-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that Cd exposure could alter the richness, diversity, and composition of intestinal  in P. clarkii. At the phylum level, the relative abundances of the prevalent phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria changed significantly after exposure to Cd. At the genus level, the most prevalent genera with significant difference in relative abundance were Bacteroides, Clostridium XlVb, Hafnia, Buttiauxella, Shewanella, Anaerorhabdus, Alistipes, Arcobacter, Azoarcus, Chryseobacterium, and so on. Furthermore, functional prediction analysis of intestinal microbial communities showed that Cd exposure could significantly alter the pathways related to metabolism, diseases, cellular processes, and so on. Taken together, exposure to Cd could induce intestinal histological damage and affect intestinal  composition and functions of P. clarkii. Our study can be an important step toward a better understanding of the toxic effects of Cd on aquatic crustaceans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD) has potential as a biologically regulated disease control method; however, the role of specific metabolites and microbial community dynamics contributing to ASD mediated disease control is mostly uncharacterized. Understanding the trajectory of co-evolutionary processes leading to syntrophic generation of functional metabolites during ASD is a necessary prelude to the predictive utilization of this disease management approach. Consequently, metabolic and microbial community profiling were used to generate highly dimensional datasets and network analysis to identify sequential transformations through aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, and anaerobic soil phases of the ASD process and distinct groups of metabolites and microorganisms linked with those stages. Transient alterations in abundance of specific microbial groups, not consistently accounted for in previous studies of the ASD process, were documented in this time-course study. Such events initially were associated with increases and subsequent diminution in highly labile metabolites conferred by the carbon input. Proliferation and dynamic compositional changes in the Firmicutes community continued throughout the anaerobic phase and was linked to temporal changes in metabolite abundance including accumulation of small chain organic acids, methyl sulfide compounds, hydrocarbons, and -cresol with antimicrobial properties. Novel potential modes of disease control during ASD were identified and the importance of the amendment and "community metabolism" for temporally supplying specific classes of labile compounds were revealed.Copyright © 2019 Hewavitharana, Klarer, Reed, Leisso, Poirier, Honaas, Rudell and Mazzola.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672153>Effect of Enterococcus faecalis 2001 on colitis and depressive-like behavior in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice: involvement of the brain-gut axis.</a></h1><p>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including those with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, have higher rates of psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety; however, the mechanism of psychiatric disorder development remains unclear. Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut  is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus.

Activated sludge (AS) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been proposed as a hotspot for ARGs. However, few studies have been conducted to uncover the temporal dynamics of the resistome of AS in WWTPs by long-term longitudinal sampling. In this study, we quantified ARGs and identified their host  in a Hong Kong WWTP in 97 monthly AS samples spanning 9 years. Throughout this analysis, we demonstrated that both the abundance and structures of the resistome changed significantly every two to three years, implying that there was a successive selection of resistomes in the AS system over the study period. The detection of genes of antibiotic-resistant pathogens that are emerging major threats to public health in the AS samples, including mcr, CRE (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae) and MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus)-related genes, highlight the role of WWTPs as reservoirs of ARGs. In addition, the core resistome (abundant and persistent genes) in AS were found to overlap with those in other ecosystems such as urban sewage, livestock feces, and fishpond sediments, revealing the broad dissemination of ARGs in WWTPs and other environments. Annual variation of resistomes were explained via structural equation modeling (SEM), which deciphered the structural linkages of determining factors such as the operational parameters, microbial community composition and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Specifically, potentially relevant antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARBs) were explored and discussed based on assembly-based analyses and network correlations. Moreover, consistent with the clear relationship between resistomes and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), it was found that there was a relatively high potential for gene exchange in AS in comparison with soil genomes, which could be explained by the engineering features of WWTPs. Based on these findings, longitudinal monitoring of WWTPs is warranted for risk assessment to reveal emerging ARGs, resistome evolution, correlations with ARBs, and the potential for spread in downstream environments and concomitant exposure risks for humans.Copyright © 2019.

If true, harnessing the functionality of this  can improve the profitability of aquaculture. The first objective of this study was to test this hypothesis if gut  is associated with fish growth rate (body weight). Four full-sibling families were stocked in the same tank and fed an identical diet. Two fast-growing and two slow-growing fish were selected from each family for 16S rRNA  profiling.  diversity varies with different DNA extraction methods. The second objective of this study was to compare the effects of five commonly used DNA extraction methods on the  profiling and to determine the most appropriate extraction method for this study. These methods were Promega-Maxwell, Phenol-chloroform, MO-BIO, Qiagen-Blood/Tissue, and Qiagen-Stool. Methods were compared according to DNA integrity, cost, feasibility and inter-sample variation based on non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (nMDS) clusters.Differences in DNA extraction methods resulted in significant variation in the identification of bacteria that compose the gut . Promega-Maxwell had the lowest inter-sample variation and was therefore used for the subsequent analyses. Beta diversity of the bacterial communities showed significant variation between breeding families but not between the fast- and slow-growing fish. However, an indicator analysis determined that cellulose, amylose degrading and amino acid fermenting bacteria (Clostridium, Leptotrichia, and Peptostreptococcus) are indicator taxa of the fast-growing fish. In contrary, pathogenic bacteria (Corynebacterium and Paeniclostridium) were identified as indicator taxa for the slow-growing fish.DNA extraction methodology should be carefully considered for accurate profiling of the gut . Although the  was not significantly different between the fast- and slow-growing fish groups, some bacterial taxa with functional implications were indicative of fish growth rate. Further studies are warranted to explore how bacteria are transmitted and potential usage of the indicator bacteria of fast-growing fish for development of probiotics that may improve fish health and growth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681025>Corrigendum: Physiological and Biochemical Effects of Intrinsically High and Low Exercise Capacities Through Multiomics Approaches.</a></h1><p>[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fphys.2019.01201.].Copyright © 2019 Tung, Hsu, Liao, Ho, Huang and Huang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674912>Life on a leaf.</a></h1><p>Microscopic water films allow bacteria to survive the seemingly dry surface of plant leaves.© 2019, Tecon.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665823>Translating In Vitro Acrolein-Trapping Capacities of Tea Polyphenol and Soy Genistein to In Vivo Situation is Mediated by the Bioavailability and Biotransformation of Individual Polyphenols.</a></h1><p>Acrolein is a highly toxic unsaturated aldehyde. Humans are both endogenously and exogenously exposed to acrolein. Long-term exposure to acrolein leads to various chronic diseases. Dietary polyphenols have been reported to be able to attenuate acrolein-induced toxicity in vitro via formation of acrolein-polyphenol conjugates. However, whether in vitro acrolein-trapping abilities of polyphenols can be maintained under in vivo environments is still unknown.Two most commonly consumed dietary polyphenols, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) from tea and genistein from soy, were used to evaluate for their anti-acrolein behaviors both in vitro and in mice. Tea EGCG exerted much higher capacity to capture acrolein than soy genistein in vitro. But translation of in vitro anti-acrolein activity into in vivo was mainly mediated by bioavailability and biotransformation of individual polyphenols. We found that 1) both absorbed EGCG and genistein could trap endogenous ACR by forming mono-ACR adducts and eventually be excreted into mouse urine; 2) both absorbed EGCG and genistein could produce active metabolites, MeEGCG and orobol, to scavenge endogenous ACR; 3) both MeEGCG and non-absorbed EGCG showed ability to trap ACR in the gut; 4) considerable amounts of microbial metabolites of genistein displayed enhanced anti-ACR capacity both in the body and in the gut, compared to genistein; and 5) biotransformation of genistein is able to boost its in vivo anti-ACR capacity, compared to EGCG.Our findings demonstrate that in vivo anti-acrolein ability of dietary polyphenols cannot be reflected solely based on their in vitro ability. The bioavailability and biotransformation of individual polyphenols especially gut  contribute to in vivo anti-acrolein ability of dietary polyphenols. This article is protected by copyright.

The results indicated that chemical pollution of sediments from Taizhou was higher than that from Xiamen. The number of sediment bacterial genera was negatively (Taizhou) or positively (Xiamen) correlated with offshore distance, owing to shifts in the primary and secondary status of organic matter and chemical pollutants for the promotion or inhibition of the sediment . The total number of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in sediments from Taizhou was larger than from Xiamen, while the number of core OTUs was smaller indicating that Taizhou had more impact on core microbes in sediments than Xiamen. This study suggests that chemical pollutants and organic matter result in different co-regulation of the off-shore sediment  of coastal industrial and tourist cities.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonizes the skin of most AD subjects and is the most common organism to cause infections. Overt bacterial infection is easily recognised by the appearance of weeping lesions, honey-coloured crusts, and pustules. However, the wide variability in clinical presentation of bacterial infection in AD and the inherent features of AD - cutaneous erythema and warmth, oozing associated with oedema, and regional lymphadenopathy - overlap with those of infection, making clinical diagnosis challenging. Furthermore, some features may be masked because of anatomical site- and skin-type-specific features, and the high frequency of S. aureus colonization in AD makes positive skin swab culture of suspected infection unreliable as a diagnostic tool. The host mechanisms and microbial virulence factors that underlie S. aureus colonization and infection in AD are incompletely understood.

While accurate identification of pathogens are essential for treatment, not all bacteria are cultivable and the impact of respiratory dysbiosis on development of pneumonia is unclear. The study purposes were to (1) characterize the lung  in canine bacterial pneumonia and compare deviations in dominant microbial populations with historical healthy controls, (2) compare bacteria identified by culture vs. 16S rDNA sequencing from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) culture-, and (3) evaluate similarities in lung and oropharyngeal (OP) microbial communities in community-acquired and secondary bacterial pneumonia. Twenty BALF samples from 15 client-owned dogs diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia were enrolled. From a subset of dogs, OP swabs were collected. Extracted DNA underwent PCR of the 16S rRNA gene. Relative abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were determined. The relative abundance of bacterial community members found in health was decreased in dogs with pneumonia. Taxa identified via culture were not always the dominant phylotype identified with sequencing. Dogs with community-acquired pneumonia were more likely to have overgrowth of a single organism suggesting loss of dominant species associated with health. Dogs with secondary bacterial pneumonia had a greater regional continuity between the upper and lower airways. Collectively, these data suggest that dysbiosis occurs in canine bacterial pneumonia, and culture-independent techniques may provide greater depth of understanding of the changes in bacterial community composition that occur in disease.Copyright © 2019 Vientós-Plotts, Ericsson, Rindt and Reinero.</p></html>
