As shown by the number of HTLV-I infected p19+ cells, the block of the selection of immortalised, infected clones by PGAs did not appear to be due to an inhibition of early stages of HTLV-I infection. The possibility that the effect of PGAs could be mediated by an action on the immune response was also examined. PGAs regulated the cell-mediated cytotoxic function of CBL to a different extent when normal non-infected or HTLV-I exposed CBL were compared. In fact, PGAs down-regulated the natural killing and macrophage/lymphocyte cytotoxic response of normal CBL, whereas they did not modify the already depressed immune response of CBL challenged with HTLV-I. These results suggest that the protective effect of PGAs against HTLV-I infection in vitro is mostly related to the direct suppression of the clonal expansion of virus-infected cells, rather than to the anti-viral activity or modulation of the cell-mediated immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6992232>The effect of  on the immune response in B-16 melanoma-bearing mice.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated the effects of  on B-16 melanoma-bearing mice. Intraperitoneal injection of  (10 microgram/day) significantly inhibited the rate of melanoma growth measured both as delay in the rate of appearance and decrease in the tumor volume. In contrast to the diluent control-treated mice, by 17 days, less than half of the -treated animals developed measurable (greater than 2 mm) subcutaneous tumors. In addition to its effect on tumor size,  was also effective in stimulating both the humoral and cellular components of the immune response. B-16 tumor-bearing mice were shown to be immunosuppressed, in that they had decreased anti-sRBC hemagglutinin titers, decreased splenic plaque-forming cells, suppressed delayed hypersensitivity responses, and delayed rejection of skin allografts from BALB/c mice. Although,  had relatively little effect on normal mice, this prostaglandin substantially improved all these immunologic parameters in tumor-bearing animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14625680>Regulation of macrophage activation.</a></h2><p>IFN-gamma rapidly primes the macrophage via JAK1/2-STAT1 pathway so that it can subsequently undergo a slower classical type 1 activation upon exposure to T helper (Th)1 cytokines such as IFNgamma or other activators, including tumor necrosis factor and lipopolysaccharide, e.g. in intracellular killing of phagocytosed Mycobacterium tuberculosis. If instead it is driven by Th2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, it undergoes alternate type 2 activation, which enhances endocytotic antigen uptake and presentation, mast cell and eosinophil involvement and type 2 granuloma formation, e.g. in response to parasitic and extracellular pathogens. Particle-induced macrophage activation was shown to differ from classical and alternate activation, showing in DNA microarray experiments (complete linkage/ Euclidean distance metric analysis) upregulation of nonsecreted structural/signaling molecules and lack of secreted proinflammatory cyto- and chemokines. The switch-off (deactivation) of already activated macrophages is an active, controlled process in which IL-10 and corticosteroids play important roles and to which 15dPGJ2, /2 and vasoactive intestinal peptide often contribute.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1582730>Modulation of human lymphocyte response to phytohemagglutinin by antineoplastic prostaglandins.</a></h2><p>The effects of antineoplstic prostaglandins (PGs) (PGE1, PGE2, , PGA2, delta 7-, PGD2, PGJ2 and delta 12-PGJ2) on human peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) responses to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) were studied in vitro. All PGs used in this study alone had no mitogenic effect on the PBL. The PBL response to PHA was significantly stimulated at low concentrations (10(-7) and 10(-8) M) of the PGE series while the high concentration (10(-5) M) markedly inhibited the PHA response.  and PGA2, metabolites of the PGE series, and also delta 7- stimulated the PHA response in a dose-dependent manner between 10(-6) and 10(-8) M, and showed a significant stimulatory effect at 10(-6) M while significantly inhibiting the PHA response at 10(-5) M. Similarly, 10(-6) and 10(-7) M (but not 10(-8) M) of PGD2 stimulated significantly the PHA response. PGJ2 and delta 12-PGJ2, which are metabolites of PGD2, also stimulated the PHA response in a dose-dependent manner between 10(-6) and 10(-8) M, and had a significant stimulatory effect at 10(-6) and 10(-7) M. The degree of the stimulatory effect was most marked with the PGD2 series among the antineoplastic PGs examined in this study. On the other hand, PGs (PGF1 alpha and PGF2 alpha) having no antineoplastic effect did not show such effects on the PHA response. These results suggest that antineoplastic PGs may have immunoregulatory effects through negative and positive feedback.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/850132>Modulation of phagocytosis by and lysosomal enzyme secretion from guinea-pig neutrophils: effect of nonsteroid anti-inflammatory agents and prostaglindins.</a></h2><p>Guinea-pig neutrophils released lysosome granule-associated beta-glucuronidase, but not cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase during cell contact with and phagocytosis of serum-treated zymosan particles. Naproxen, chloroquine and indomethacin inhibited particle uptake by and lysosomal enzyme secretion from neutrophils incubated with zymosan in Krebs-Ringer phosphate medium, pH 7.4, at 37 degrees C. Acetylsalicyclic acid, fenoprofen and ibuprofen were inactive. Prostaglandins (PG) E1, E2, A1, A2, B1 and B2 reduced particle ingestion by and discharge of lysosomal enzymes from neutrophils. PGF2alpha accelerated lysosomal enzyme release, had no effect on phagocytosis at high concentrations and inhibited both processes at low concentrations.. PGF1alpha was inactive. In the presence of cytochalasin B, an agent which inhibits phagocytosis while havine no effect on selective lysosomal enzyme secretion, naproxen, chloroquine and indomethacin, continued to inhibit the discharge of beta-glucuronidase from neutrophils. PGE1, PGE2, , PGA2, PGB1 and PGB2 reduced lysosomal enzyme release from cytochalasin B-treated neutrophils. PGF2alpha accelerated at high and inhibited at low concentrations the selective secretion of beta-glucuronidase from cytochalasin B-treated neutrophils. PGF1alpha was again inactive. These studies indicated that guinea-pig neutrophils are capable of a selective release of lysosomal enzymes (beta-glucuronidase) during ingestion of serum-treated zymosan particles and that certain anti-inflammatory drugs and prostaglansins may function as modulators of the phagocytic release of lysosomal enzymes from neutrophils.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6975765>Pharmacologic and biochemical modulation of human T-lymphocyte colony formation: hormonal influences.</a></h2><p>The generation of T-cell colonies from human peripheral blood lymphocytes is a sensitive in vitro measure of cell-mediated , considered to be under different and/or additional regulatory controls than short-term liquid cultures. The influences of steroids (aldosterone, estradiol, diethylstilbestrol, hydrocortisone, prednisolone, progesterone, testosterone), prostaglandins (, PGA2, PGB1, PGB2, PGE1, PGE2, PGF1 alpha), bradykinin, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP), epinephrine, glucagon, histamine, insulin, luteinizing hormone, luteotropic hormone, serotonin, and thyroxin on the generation of both T-cell colonies in semisolid phase and induction of transformation in liquid culture was assessed in parallel assays. Steroids uniformly suppressed both types of culture systems, although colony formation appeared more sensitive by several hours of magnitude. In contrast, significant differences in the response of lymphocytes in colony formation assay, compared to liquid transformation, was noted for the other agents. Prostaglandins significantly inhibited colony formation even in the presence of as little as 10(-12) M PGE2; however, liquid culture responses were suppressed only by higher concentrations (10(-5) M) and enhanced transformation was found at lower concentrations (10(-9) M). Bradykinin, glucagon, and luteinizing hormone did not significantly influence either colony formation or liquid transformation. In contrast, cyclic AMP inhibited and cyclic GMP stimulated colony formation and liquid transformation. Histamine, insulin, epinephrine, and serotonin all had significant positive or negative influences on colony formation in concentrations that produced no detectable effects using conventional liquid transformation assays. Finally, correlation analysis of drug effects for each system extends the thesis that these assays quantitate different parameters of T-cell function. T-lymphocyte colony formation is a promising diagnostic tool for rapid screening of immune modulating agents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10638762>Anti-inflammatory cyclopentenone prostaglandins are direct inhibitors of IkappaB kinase.</a></h2><p>NF-kappaB is a critical activator of genes involved in  and immunity. Pro-inflammatory cytokines activate the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex that phosphorylates the NF-kappaB inhibitors, triggering their conjugation with ubiquitin and subsequent degradation. Freed NF-kappaB dimers translocate to the nucleus and induce target genes, including the one for cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX2), which catalyses the synthesis of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins, in particular PGE. At late stages of inflammatory episodes, however, COX2 directs the synthesis of anti-inflammatory cyclopentenone prostaglandins, suggesting a role for these molecules in the resolution of . Cyclopentenone prostaglandins have been suggested to exert anti-inflammatory activity through the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma. Here we demonstrate a novel mechanism of antiinflammatory activity which is based on the direct inhibition and modification of the IKKbeta subunit of IKK. As IKKbeta is responsible for the activation of NF-kappaB by pro-inflammatory stimuli, our findings explain how cyclopentenone prostaglandins function and can be used to improve the utility of COX2 inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8468116>Combined treatments with interferon (alpha,beta) plus  to control early infection with HTLV-I in primary cord blood-derived mononuclear cells.</a></h2><p>Interferon (IFN) alpha and beta can activate an antiviral and immunomodulating response in primary cord blood-derived mononuclear cells (CBMC) exposed to infection with Human T-cell Leukemia Virus type I (HTLV-I), resulting in partial inhibition of early infection in vitro. On the other hand, , a PGE1-derived cyclopentenone prostaglandin, can inhibit in vitro the proliferation of virus-infected CBMC, preventing the emergence of the potentially transformed clone. In order to achieve a complete control of HTLV-I infection in this experimental model, we evaluated whether the antiviral activity of IFNs and the antiproliferative activity of  could be preserved in a combination therapy scheme. Recipient CBMC were treated with IFN alpha or beta (1000 IU/ml) at the onset of the co-culture with lethally irradiated virus-donor MT-2 cells, followed by multiple treatments with  (4 micrograms/ml every 4 days, starting on day 0) for 6 weeks post infection (p.i.). In -treated co-cultures the percentage of virus-positive CBMC was constantly doubled during culture time as well as the amount of viral transcripts and p19 virus core protein production were increased. The antiviral effects of IFNs, resulting in about a 50% reduction of the percentage of virus-positive CBMC and consequently in a partial inhibition of virus expression (HTLV-I transcription and p19 production) until 4 weeks p.i., were suppressed by multiple  treatments. However, the antiproliferative effect of  was enforced in IFN-treated co-cultures, leading to earlier control of proliferation of virus-infected cells. Interestingly, infection of CBMC with HTLV-I was associated with persistent expression of 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70), for at least 4 weeks p.i. IFNs and  showed antagonistic effects on HSP70 production in infected CBMC. In fact, production of HSP70 was suppressed (or prevented) in IFN-treated co-cultures, tested 2 and 4 weeks p.i. The fact that the expression of HSP70 is apparently suppressed (or prevented) by IFN treatment is surprising, since expression of this protein family has been associated with antiviral immunity.  could totally reverse the IFN-mediated suppression of HSP70 expression in these co-cultures. It is presently unclear whether HSP70 expression is directly involved in the control of proliferation exerted by  against virus-infected CBMC or is an epiphenomenon associated with inhibition of cell growth.</p></html>
