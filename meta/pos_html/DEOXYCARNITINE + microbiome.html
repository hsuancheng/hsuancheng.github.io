This study focuses on the adverse effects of oral supplementation of 1.3% LC in ApoE mice and whether the parenteral administration of LC (subcutaneously, sub) has any impact on the development of atherosclerosis.Mice are randomly divided into three groups (n = 15). All mice are fed a high-fat diet (HFD). The number of Ly6C monocytes; degree of atherosclerosis; plasma LC, γ-butyrobetaine (γBB), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) levels; and microbial community composition are analyzed. Compared with the HFD and HFD ± LC (sub) groups, the number of Ly6C monocytes, atherosclerotic plaque area, and plasma γBB and TMAO levels are increased in the HFD ± LC (oral) group (p < 0.001). Plasma LC levels in the HFD ± LC (sub) group are higher than those in other groups. The levels of γBB, TMAO, and Ly6C monocytes are positively correlated with atherosclerotic plaque area (p < 0.01), and TMAO is positively correlated with Bacteroidetes and negatively correlated with Firmicutes at the phylum level.In contrast with oral LC administration, subcutaneous LC administration, which bypasses its conversion to TMAO in the liver, does not have a detrimental effect on the development of atherosclerosis in male ApoE mice. Taking LC parenterally may be preferable among patients who require LC supplementation.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

TMA found in humans is exclusively of bacterial origin, and its metabolite, trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), has been associated with atherosclerosis and heart and renal failure. We isolated four different Rieske oxygenases and determined that there are no significant differences in their substrate panels. All three had high activity toward carnitine/, medium activity toward glycine betaine, and very low activity toward choline. We tested the influence of low oxygen concentrations on TMA production in CntA-containing Providencia rettgeri cell cultures and discovered that this process, although dependent on the amount of oxygen, is still feasible in environments with 1 and 0.2% oxygen, which is comparable to oxygen levels in some parts of the digestive system.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We evaluated if circulating γBB, TMAO, and their common precursors carnitine and trimethyllysine (TML) were dysregulated after heart transplantation and associated with development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) and acute rejection.We measured these metabolites in plasma from heart transplant recipients with everolimus-based (n = 32) and standard cyclosporine-based immunosuppression (n = 30) at different time-points and accompanied by assessment of CAV by intravascular ultrasound.Baseline levels of carnitine, TMAO, and TML were elevated in heart transplant recipients compared with controls, and TML remained elevated throughout the observation period. The -dependent metabolite γBB increased steadily during 3 years of follow-up, with a similar decrease in its endogenous precursor TML. The increase in γBB and the change in TML were associated with a change in total atheroma volume from baseline to 3 years. Increases in γBB and carnitine levels from baseline to 1 year were associated with an increased frequency of acute rejection within the first year after heart transplant.Our study reveals alterations of the carnitine-γBB-TMAO pathway after heart transplant, with increasing levels of γBB being associated with acute rejection and increase in total atheroma volume during 3 years of follow-up. Future studies should clarify whether interactions between dietary factors, immunosuppressive drugs, and the gut  could influence acute rejection and CAV development to delineate mechanisms and potential novel treatment targets.Copyright © 2019 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

Orally ingested γBB has a pro-atherogenic effect in experimental studies, but γBB has not been studied in relation to atherosclerosis in humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between serum levels of γBB, TMAO and their common precursors Carnitine and trimethyllysine (TML) and carotid atherosclerosis and adverse outcome.Serum γBB, Carnitine, TML and TMAO were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography in patients with carotid artery atherosclerosis (n = 264) and healthy controls (n = 62).Serum γBB (p = 0.024) and Carnitine (p = 0.001), but not TMAO or TML, were increased in patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Higher levels of γBB and TML, but not TMAO or Carnitine were independently associated with cardiovascular death also after adjustment for age and eGFR (adjusted HR [95%] 3.3 [1.9-9.1], p = 0.047 and 6.0 [1.8-20.34], p = 0.026, respectively).Patients with carotid atherosclerosis had increased serum levels of γBB, and elevated levels of γBB and its precursor TML were associated with cardiovascular mortality. Long-term clinical studies of γBB, as a cardiovascular risk marker, and safety studies regarding dietary supplementation of γBB, are warranted.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The contribution of γBB in gut -dependent l-carnitine metabolism in humans is unknown.Omnivores and vegans/vegetarians ingested deuterium-labeled l-carnitine (d3-l-carnitine) or γBB (d9-γBB), and both plasma metabolites and fecal polymicrobial transformations were examined at baseline, following oral antibiotics, or following chronic (≥2 months) l-carnitine supplementation. Human fecal commensals capable of performing each step of the l-carnitine→γBB→TMA transformation were identified.Studies with oral d3-l-carnitine or d9-γBB before versus after antibiotic exposure revealed gut  contribution to the initial 2 steps in a metaorganismal l-carnitine→γBB→TMA→TMAO pathway in subjects. Moreover, a striking increase in d3-TMAO generation was observed in omnivores over vegans/vegetarians (>20-fold; P = 0.001) following oral d3-l-carnitine ingestion, whereas fasting endogenous plasma l-carnitine and γBB levels were similar in vegans/vegetarians (n = 32) versus omnivores (n = 40). Fecal metabolic transformation studies, and oral isotope tracer studies before versus after chronic l-carnitine supplementation, revealed that omnivores and vegans/vegetarians alike rapidly converted carnitine to γBB, whereas the second gut microbial transformation, γBB→TMA, was diet inducible (l-carnitine, omnivorous). Extensive anaerobic subculturing of human feces identified no single commensal capable of l-carnitine→TMA transformation, multiple community members that converted l-carnitine to γBB, and only 1 Clostridiales bacterium, Emergencia timonensis, that converted γBB to TMA. In coculture, E. timonensis promoted the complete l-carnitine→TMA transformation.In humans, dietary l-carnitine is converted into the atherosclerosis- and thrombosis-promoting metabolite TMAO via 2 sequential gut -dependent transformations: (a) initial rapid generation of the atherogenic intermediate γBB, followed by (b) transformation into TMA via low-abundance  in omnivores, and to a markedly lower extent, in vegans/vegetarians. Gut  γBB→TMA/TMAO transformation is induced by omnivorous dietary patterns and chronic l-carnitine exposure.ClinicalTrials.gov .NIH and Office of Dietary Supplements grants HL103866, HL126827, and DK106000, and the Leducq Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27081744>Major Increase in Microbiota-Dependent Proatherogenic Metabolite TMAO One Year After Bariatric Surgery.</a></h2><p>Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is formed in the liver from trimethylamine (TMA), a product exclusively generated by the gut microbiota from dietary phosphatidylcholine and carnitine. An alternative pathway of TMAO formation from carnitine is via the microbiota-dependent intermediate γ-butyrobetaine (γBB). Elevated TMAO levels are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), but little is known about TMAO in . Given the proposed contribution of microbiota alterations in  and type 2 diabetes (T2D), we investigated the potential impact of , lifestyle-induced weight loss, and bariatric surgery on plasma levels of TMAO, its microbiota-dependent intermediate γBB, and its diet-dependent precursors carnitine and choline.TMAO, γBB, carnitine, and choline were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in 34 obese individuals (17 with and 17 without T2D) undergoing bariatric surgery and 17 controls.TMAO was not elevated in obese patients or reduced by lifestyle interventions but increased approximately twofold after bariatric surgery. Similar to TMAO, plasma levels of γBB were not influenced by lifestyle interventions but increased moderately after bariatric surgery. In contrast, carnitine and choline, which are abundant in nutrients, such as in red meat and eggs, and not microbiota dependent, were reduced after lifestyle interventions and rebounded after bariatric surgery.The major increase in TMAO after bariatric surgery was unexpected because high TMAO levels have been linked to CVD, whereas bariatric surgery is known to reduce CVD risk. Prospective studies of gut microbiota composition and related metabolites in relation to long-term cardiovascular risk after bariatric surgery are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25440057>γ-Butyrobetaine is a proatherogenic intermediate in gut microbial metabolism of L-carnitine to TMAO.</a></h2><p>L-carnitine, a nutrient in red meat, was recently reported to accelerate atherosclerosis via a metaorganismal pathway involving gut microbial trimethylamine (TMA) formation and host hepatic conversion into trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Herein, we show that following L-carnitine ingestion, γ-butyrobetaine (γBB) is produced as an intermediary metabolite by gut microbes at a site anatomically proximal to and at a rate ∼1,000-fold higher than the formation of TMA. Moreover, we show that γBB is the major gut microbial metabolite formed from dietary L-carnitine in mice, is converted into TMA and TMAO in a gut -dependent manner (like dietary L-carnitine), and accelerates atherosclerosis. Gut microbial composition and functional metabolic studies reveal that distinct taxa are associated with the production of γBB or TMA/TMAO from dietary L-carnitine. Moreover, despite their close structural similarity, chronic dietary exposure to L-carnitine or γBB promotes development of functionally distinct microbial communities optimized for the metabolism of L-carnitine or γBB, respectively.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Resistant starches (RS) alter the human microbiota. We sought to determine whether diets varying in RS and carbohydrate (CHO) content affect plasma TMAO levels. We also assessed postprandial glucose and insulin responses and plasma lipid changes to diets high and low in RS. In a cross-over trial, fifty-two men and women consumed a 2-week baseline diet (41 percentage of energy (%E) CHO, 40 % fat, 19 % protein), followed by 2-week high- and low-RS diets separated by 2-week washouts. RS diets were assigned at random within the context of higher (51-53 %E) v. lower CHO (39-40 %E) intake. Measurements were obtained in the fasting state and, for glucose and insulin, during a meal test matching the composition of the assigned diet. With lower CHO intake, plasma TMAO, carnitine, betaine and γ-butyrobetaine concentrations were higher after the high- v. low-RS diet (P<0·01 each). These metabolites were not differentially affected by high v. low RS when CHO intake was high. Although the high-RS meal reduced postprandial insulin and glucose responses when CHO intake was low (P<0·01 each), RS did not affect fasting lipids, lipoproteins, glucose or insulin irrespective of dietary CHO content. In conclusion, a lower-CHO diet high in RS was associated with higher plasma TMAO levels. These findings, together with the absence of change in fasting lipids, suggest that short-term high-RS diets do not improve markers of cardiometabolic health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29699662>Ruminant meat and milk contain δ-valerobetaine, another precursor of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) like γ-butyrobetaine.</a></h2><p>Quaternary ammonium compounds containing N-trimethylamino moiety, such as choline derivatives and carnitine, abundant in meat and dairy products, are metabolic precursors of trimethylamine (TMA). A similar fate is reported for N-trimethyllysine and γ-butyrobetaine. With the aim at investigating the metabolic profile of such metabolites in most employed animal dietary sources, HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analyses on ruminant and non-ruminant milk and meat were performed. Results demonstrate, for the first time, the presence of δ-valerobetaine, occurring at levels higher than γ-butyrobetaine in all ruminant samples compared to non-ruminants. Demonstration of δ-valerobetaine metabolic origin, surprisingly, showed that it originates from rumen through the transformation of dietary N-trimethyllysine. These results highlight our previous findings showing the ubiquity of free N-trimethyllysine in vegetable kingdom. Furthermore, δ-valerobetaine, similarly to γ-butyrobetaine, can be degraded by host gut  producing TMA, precursor of the proatherogenic trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), unveiling its possible role in the biosynthetic route of TMAO.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, other plasma risk factors linked to cardiovascular disease are less studied. This study aimed to penetrate the effect of a phospholipid-protein complex (PPC) from Antarctic krill on one-carbon metabolism and production of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in rats. Male Wistar rats were fed isoenergetic control, 6%, or 11% PPC diets for four weeks. Rats fed PPC had reduced total homocysteine plasma level and increased levels of choline, dimethylglycine and cysteine, whereas the plasma level of methionine was unchanged compared to control. PPC feeding increased the plasma level of TMAO, carnitine, its precursors trimethyllysine and γ-butyrobetaine. There was a close correlation between plasma TMAO and carnitine, trimethyllysine, and γ-butyrobetaine, but not between TMAO and choline. The present data suggest that PPC has a homocysteine lowering effect and is associated with altered plasma concentrations of metabolites related to one-carbon metabolism and B-vitamin status in rats. Moreover, the present study reveals a non-obligatory role of gut  in the increased plasma TMAO level as it can be explained by the PPC's content of TMAO. The increased level of carnitine and carnitine precursors is interpreted to reflect increased carnitine biosynthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25301199>Suppression of intestinal -dependent production of pro-atherogenic trimethylamine N-oxide by shifting L-carnitine microbial degradation.</a></h2><p>Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is produced in host liver from trimethylamine (TMA). TMAO and TMA share common dietary quaternary amine precursors, carnitine and choline, which are metabolized by the intestinal . TMAO recently has been linked to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and severity of cardiovascular diseases. We examined the effects of anti-atherosclerotic compound meldonium, an aza-analogue of carnitine bioprecursor  (GBB), on the availability of TMA and TMAO.Wistar rats received L-carnitine, GBB or choline alone or in combination with meldonium. Plasma, urine and rat small intestine perfusate samples were assayed for L-carnitine, GBB, choline and TMAO using UPLC-MS/MS. Meldonium effects on TMA production by intestinal bacteria from L-carnitine and choline were tested.Treatment with meldonium significantly decreased intestinal -dependent production of TMA/TMAO from L-carnitine, but not from choline. 24hours after the administration of meldonium, the urinary excretion of TMAO was 3.6 times lower in the combination group than in the L-carnitine-alone group. In addition, the administration of meldonium together with L-carnitine significantly increased GBB concentration in blood plasma and in isolated rat small intestine perfusate. Meldonium did not influence bacterial growth and bacterial uptake of L-carnitine, but TMA production by the intestinal  bacteria K. pneumoniae was significantly decreased.We have shown for the first time that TMA/TMAO production from quaternary amines could be decreased by targeting bacterial TMA-production. In addition, the production of pro-atherogenic TMAO can be suppressed by shifting the microbial degradation pattern of supplemental/dietary quaternary amines.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We performed randomized-controlled dietary intervention studies to explore the impact of chronic dietary patterns on TMAO levels, metabolism and renal excretion.Volunteers (N = 113) were enrolled in a randomized 2-arm (high- or low-saturated fat) crossover design study. Within each arm, three 4-week isocaloric diets (with washout period between each) were evaluated (all meals prepared in metabolic kitchen with 25% calories from protein) to examine the effects of red meat, white meat, or non-meat protein on TMAO metabolism. Trimethylamine N-oxide and other trimethylamine (TMA) related metabolites were quantified at the end of each diet period. A random subset (N = 13) of subjects also participated in heavy isotope tracer studies. Chronic red meat, but not white meat or non-meat ingestion, increased plasma and urine TMAO (each >two-fold; P < 0.0001). Red meat ingestion also significantly reduced fractional renal excretion of TMAO (P < 0.05), but conversely, increased fractional renal excretion of carnitine, and two alternative gut -generated metabolites of carnitine, γ-butyrobetaine, and crotonobetaine (P < 0.05). Oral isotope challenge revealed red meat or white meat (vs. non-meat) increased TMA and TMAO production from carnitine (P < 0.05 each) but not choline. Dietary-saturated fat failed to impact TMAO or its metabolites.Chronic dietary red meat increases systemic TMAO levels through: (i) enhanced dietary precursors; (ii) increased microbial TMA/TMAO production from carnitine, but not choline; and (iii) reduced renal TMAO excretion. Discontinuation of dietary red meat reduces plasma TMAO within 4 weeks.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author(s) 2018.

Many follow a low-phenylalanine (low-Phe) diet devoid of animal protein in combination with medical foods (MFs).To assess lipid metabolism in participants with PKU consuming amino acid MFs (AA-MFs) or glycomacropeptide MFs (GMP-MFs), we conducted fatty acid and metabolomics analyses.We used subsets of fasting plasma and urine samples from our randomized crossover trial in which participants with early-treated classical and variant (milder) PKU consumed a low-Phe diet combined with AA-MFs or GMP-MFs for 3 wk each. Fatty acid profiles of red blood cell (RBC) membranes were determined for 25 adults (aged 18-49 y) with PKU and 143 control participants. Metabolomics analyses of plasma and urine samples were conducted by Metabolon for 9-10 adolescent and adult participants with PKU and for 15 control participants.RBC fatty acid profiles were not significantly different with AA-MFs or GMP-MFs. PKU participants showed higher total n-6:n-3 (ω-6:ω-3) fatty acids (mean ± SD percentages of total fatty acids: AA-MF = 5.45% ± 1.07%; controls = 4.33%; P < 0.001) and lower docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; AA-MF = 3.21% ± 0.98%; controls = 3.70% ± 1.01%; P = 0.02) and eicosapentaenoic acid (AA-MF = 0.33% ± 0.12%; controls = 0.60% ± 0.43%; P < 0.001) in RBCs than did control participants. Despite higher carnitine intake from AA-MFs than GMP-MFs (mean ± SE intake: AA-MFs = 58.6 ± 5.3 mg/d; GMP-MFs = 0.3 ± 0.01 mg/d; P < 0.001), plasma concentrations of carnitine were similar and not different from those in the control group (AA-MF compared with GMP-MF, P = 0.73). AA-MFs resulted in higher urinary excretion of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which is synthesized by bacteria from carnitine, compared with GMP-MFs (mean ± SE scaled intensity-TMAO: AA-MFs = 1.2 ± 0.1, GMP-MFs = 0.9 ± 0.1; P = 0.005). Plasma  was lower in PKU participants than in control participants, suggesting reduced carnitine biosynthesis in PKU (AA-MF = 0.9 ± 0.1; GMP-MF = 1.0 ± 0.1; controls = 1.3 ± 0.1; AA-MF compared with controls, P = 0.01; GMP-MF compared with controls, P = 0.04).Supplementation with DHA is needed in PKU. Carnitine supplementation of AA-MFs shows reduced bioavailability due, in part, to bacterial degradation to TMAO, whereas the bioavailability of carnitine is greater with prebiotic GMP-MFs.
