<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27289257>[Lower limb peripheral arterial disease in 268 patients in Guadeloupe].</a></h2><p>Peripheral arterial disease of the lower limbs is a serious condition because of its local and general prognosis.To identify the localization of peripheral arterial disease, associated risk factors, topography and features of the disease in Guadeloupe.A descriptive non-interventional study was performed in Guadeloupe located in French West Indies from March to June 2014. Data for all patients, who underwent Doppler ultrasound of the lower limb in a vascular outpatient clinic and in the University Hospital in Guadeloupe for known or suspected peripheral arterial disease were included.The study included 268 patients. Localizations were: infrapopliteal (n=227 patients), popliteal (n=148), femoral (n=185) and aorto-iliac (n=115). Smoking was associated with aorto-iliac (16 patients; P<0.05) and femoral (27 patients; P<0.05) localizations. Diabetes was associated with infrapopliteal localizations (133 patients; P<0.05), and high blood pressure was associated with infrapopliteal, popliteal and femoral localizations. Mean age was 73.1±10.8 years; half of patients (51 %) were women. Peripheral arterial disease was known for 52 % of the population; 147 patients were asymptomatic. Associated factors were high blood pressure (88 %), diabetes (63 %), dyslipidemia (45 %), and smoking (7 %). Ischemic heart disease was found in 14 % of patients, cerebrovascular disease in 18 % and all three localizations in 4 %. A history of amputation, bypass or endovascular treatment was found in 11 %, 20 % and 32 % of patients respectively.In our population, an infrapopliteal site was more often found than a proximal site. Distal localization was associated with diabetes, and proximal localization with smoking. Cardiovascular risk factors exhibited an atypical pattern with a large majority of patients (88 %) having high blood pressure, two-thirds diabetes, but with very few (7 %) smokers. Peripheral arterial disease was more often associated with a history of stroke than with ischemic heart disease.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Mounting evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for improving eating psychopathology and psychological distress among bariatric patients, and telephone-based CBT (Tele-CBT) is a novel delivery method that increases treatment accessibility.This study aimed to identify demographic and clinical predictors of response to Tele-CBT among 79 patients who received Tele-CBT in 3 previous studies. Listwise deletion was applied, after which 58 patients were included in a multivariate linear regression adjusted for age, sex and education status, to evaluate patient rurality index (urban or nonurban), and baseline binge eating, emotional eating and depression symptoms, as predictors of tele-CBT response.The predictors explained 31% of the observed variance [R=0.312, F(4,57)=3.238, p<0.01]. Patient rurality index (beta=0.341, p<0.01) was the only statistically significant predictor of Tele-CBT response.Given the limited psychosocial resources available in many bariatric surgery programs, the findings suggest that Tele-CBT may be particularly beneficial for patients residing in nonurban communities with limited access to other health-care services.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Diabetes Association.
