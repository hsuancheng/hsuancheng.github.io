All mutants comprised changes in beta-sheet residues, with sidechains at positions 5 (), 7 (), 52 () and 54 (Val) forming the beta-sheet side of the sheet-helix core interface. A solvent exposed position -6 was chosen as a control. Randomization of bases at codon positions 1 and 3 with thymine at position 2 introduces five possible hydrophobic amino acids, namely , Val, , , and Met. The distribution of encoded amino acids at all five positions is approximately as expected theoretically and indicates that no major bias was introduced towards particular residues. The overall structural integrity of several mutants, as assessed by NMR, ranges from very close to wild type to fully unfolded. Interestingly, the stability of the mutants is not strictly correlated with the number of changes or residue volume.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16935948>Phenol red interacts with the protofibril-like oligomers of an amyloidogenic hexapeptide NFGAIL through both hydrophobic and aromatic contacts.</a></h1><p>Amyloid-associated diseases affect millions of people worldwide. Phenol red exhibits modest inhibition toward fibril formation of human Islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) and its toxicity, which is associated with type II diabetes mellitus. However, the molecular level mechanisms of interactions remain elusive. The binding of phenol red molecules to the protofibrils of an amyloidogenic fragment (NFGAIL) of hIAPP has been investigated by molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvent. The phenol red molecules were observed to bind primarily along either beta-sheet stacking or beta-strand directions. Through its three aromatic rings, the phenol red molecule preferentially interacted with the hydrophobic side chains of , , and ; and the polar sulfone and hydroxyl groups were mainly exposed in solvent. Thus, phenol red improves the solubility of the early protofibrils and represses further growth. Interestingly, there was no obvious preference toward the aromatic  residue in comparison to the hydrophobic  or  residues. The lack of binding along the hydrogen bond direction indicates that phenol red does not directly block the beta-sheet extension. Further free energy analysis suggested that a phenol red analog may potentially improve the binding affinity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20042596>Structural basis for the association of the redox-sensitive target of rapamycin FATC domain with membrane-mimetic micelles.</a></h1><p>The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a conserved eukaryotic Ser/Thr kinase that regulates cellular growth in response to the nutrient and energy state. TOR signaling plays an important role in the development of diseases such as cancer, , and diabetes and in different redox-sensitive processes (hypoxia, apoptosis, and aging). Because TOR has been detected at different cellular membranes and in the nucleus, its localization may influence the specific signaling readout. To better understand how TOR can associate with different membranes, the lipid-binding properties of the redox-sensitive yeast TOR1 FATC domain (y1fatc) have been characterized by solution NMR spectroscopy. Binding studies with different lipids indicate that y1fatc interacts specifically with a membrane-mimetic environment but appears not to recognize a specific lipid headgroup. In both, the structures of oxidized and reduced micelle-bound y1fatc, residues -2456 to Trp-2470 of the lipid-binding motif form a hydrophobic bulb that has a rim of charged residues. The diffusion constants for both micelle-bound states are consistent with the rotational correlation times from the analysis of the (15)N relaxation data. Based on the K(d) values, the oxidized form (K(d) approximately 0.31 mm) binds dodecyl phosphocholine micelles slightly tighter than the reduced form (K(d) approximately 1.86 mM). Binding studies with y1fatc in which one or both tryptophans (Trp-2466 and Trp-2470) were replaced by alanine suggest that these residues are important for the exact positioning in the membrane and that the other aromatic (His-2462, Tyr-2463, and -2469) and aliphatic residues (-2456, -2459, -2464, and Pro-2468) in the lipid-binding motif contribute significantly to the affinity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22898766>Degradation of islet amyloid polypeptide by neprilysin.</a></h1><p>A progressive loss of pancreatic beta cell function, a decrease in beta cell mass and accumulation of islet amyloid is characteristic of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The main constituent of islet amyloid is islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). In this study, we examined the ability of the peptidase neprilysin to cleave IAPP and prevent human IAPP-induced pancreatic beta cell toxicity.Neprilysin and a catalytically compromised neprilysin mutant were tested for their ability to inhibit human IAPP fibrillisation and human IAPP-induced pancreatic beta cell cytotoxicity. Degradation of human IAPP by neprilysin was followed by HPLC, and the degradation products were identified by MS.Neprilysin prevented IAPP fibrillisation by cleaving IAPP at Arg(11)-(12), (12)-Ala(13), Asn(14)-(15), (15)-(16), Asn(22)-(23) and Ala(25)-(26). It also appears to prevent human IAPP fibrillisation through a non-catalytic interaction. Neprilysin protected against beta cell cytotoxicity induced by exogenously added or endogenously produced human IAPP.The data presented support a potential therapeutic role for neprilysin in preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study supports the hypothesis that extracellular human IAPP contributes to human IAPP-induced beta cell cytotoxicity. Whether human IAPP exerts its cytotoxic effect through a totally extracellular mechanism or through a cellular reuptake mechanism is unclear at this time.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28711271>Identification of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitory peptides from mare whey protein hydrolysates.</a></h1><p>Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) activity is a promising strategy for treatment of type 2 . In the current study, DPP-IV inhibitory peptides were identiﬁed from mare whey protein hydrolysates obtained by papain. The results showed that all the mare whey protein hydrolysates obtained at various hydrolysis durations possessed more potent DPP-IV inhibitory activity compared with intact whey protein. The 4-h hydrolysates showed the greatest DPP-IV inhibitory activity with half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.18 mg/mL. The 2 novel peptides from 4-h hydrolysate fractions separated by successive chromatographic steps were characterized by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The novel peptides Asn--Glu----Arg and Thr-Gln-Met-Val-Asp-Glu-Glu--Met-Glu-Lys--Arg, which corresponded to β-lactoglobulin 1 f(71-77) and β-lactoglobulin 1 f(143-155), demonstrated DPP-IV inhibitory activity with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 86.34 and 69.84 μM, respectively. The DPP-IV inhibitory activity of the 2 peptides was retained or even improved after simulated gastrointestinal digestion in vitro. Our findings indicate that mare whey protein-derived peptides may possess potential as functional food ingredients in the management of type 2 .Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

Fifteen weeks antepartum, 38 multiparous Holstein cows were allocated to either a high body condition group (HBCS; n = 19) or a normal body condition group (NBCS; n = 19) and were fed different diets until dry-off (d -49 relative to calving) to amplify the difference. The groups were also stratified for comparable milk yields (NBCS: 10,361 ± 302 kg; HBCS: 10,315 ± 437 kg). At dry-off, the NBCS cows (parity: 2.42 ± 1.84; body weight: 665 ± 64 kg) had a body condition score (BCS) <3.5 and backfat thickness (BFT) <1.2 cm, whereas the HBCS cows (parity: 3.37 ± 1.67; body weight: 720 ± 57 kg) had a BCS >3.75 and BFT >1.4 cm. During the dry period and the subsequent lactation, both groups were fed identical diets but maintained the BCS and BFT differences. Blood samples and skeletal muscle biopsies (semitendinosus) were repeatedly (d -49, +3, +21, and +84 relative to calving) collected for assessing the concentrations of free AA and the mRNA abundance of various components of mTOR and UPS. The differences in BCS and BFT were maintained throughout the study. The circulating concentrations of most AA with the exception of Gly, Gln, Met, and  increased in early lactation in both groups. The serum concentrations of Ala (d +21 and +84) and Orn (d +84) were lower in HBCS cows than in NBCS cows, but those of Gly, His, , Val, Lys, Met, and Orn on d -49 and  on d +21 were greater in HBCS cows than in NBCS cows. The serum concentrations of 3-methylhistidine, creatinine, and 3-methylhistidine:creatinine ratio increased after calving (d +3) but did not differ between the groups. The muscle concentrations of all AA (except for Cys) remained unchanged over time and did not differ between groups. The muscle concentrations of Cys were greater on d -49 but tended to be lower on d +21 in HBCS cows than in NBCS cows. On d +21, mTOR and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 mRNA abundance was greater in HBCS cows than in NBCS cows, whereas ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 was not different between the groups. The mRNA abundance of ubiquitin-activating enzyme 1 (d +21), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 1 (d +21), atrogin-1 (d +21), and ring finger protein-1 (d +3) enzymes was greater in HBCS cows than in NBCS cows, whereas ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2 was not different between the groups. The increased mRNA abundance of key components of mTOR signaling and of muscle-specific ligases of HBCS cows may indicate a simultaneous activation of anabolic and catabolic processes and thus increased muscle protein turnover, likely as a part of the adaptive response to prevent excessive loss of skeletal muscle mass during early lactation.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

We have developed a modification of the yeast two-hybrid system to study this interaction and have used it to characterize the interaction of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) with its receptor by using GAL4 transcriptional regulation with a beta-galactosidase assay as readout. In this system, IGF-1 and proIGF-1 bound to the cysteine-rich domain, extracellular domain, or entire IGF-1 proreceptor. This interaction was specific. Thus, proinsulin showed no significant interaction with the IGF-1 receptor, while a chimeric proinsulin containing the C-peptide of IGF-1 had an intermediate interaction, consistent with its affinity for the IGF-1 receptor. Over 2000 IGF-1 mutants were generated by PCR and screened for interaction with the color assay. About 40% showed a strong interaction, 20% showed an intermediate interaction, and 40% give little or no signal. Of 50 mutants that were sequenced, several (-5 --> His, Glu-9 --> Val, Arg-37 --> Gly, and Met-59 --> ) appeared to enhance receptor association, others resulted in weaker receptor interaction (Tyr-31 -->  and -43 --> ), and two gave no detectable signal (-14 --> Arg and Glu-46 --> Ala). Using PCR-based mutagenesis with proinsulin, we also identified a gain of function mutant (proinsulin -17 --> Pro) that allowed for a strong IGF-1-receptor interaction. These data demonstrate that the specificity of the interaction between a hormone and its receptor can be characterized with high efficiency in the two-hybrid system and that novel hormone analogues may be found by this method.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1383130>Further studies on proteinases and alpha 2-macroglobulin activity in diabetic plasma.</a></h1><p>Loss of chymotrypsin binding capacity of alpha 2-macroglobulin in diabetic plasma on in vitro incubation, could be partially prevented by phenylmethyl sulphonyl fluoride and pepstatin A. Prior ten-fold dilution of plasma with 0.02 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) completely arrested the process. The phenomenon could not be reactivated by Ca2+, lecithin or bovine serum albumin. Diabetic plasma, like normal plasma, exhibited maximal hydrolytic activities on H-D-Pro--Arg-p-nitroanilide, H-D-Val--Arg-p-nitroanilide and H-D--Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide. The hydrolytic activities were not significantly diminished on incubation of plasma at 37 degrees C for 12 hr, unlike alpha 2-macroglobulin activity. On gel chromatography on Sephadex G-200, part of the proteolytic activity in diabetic plasma coeluted with alpha 2-macroglobulin in the VO region. A second activity peak (absent in normal plasma) was eluted with a Ve/V0 value of 1.40. Possible role of free proteinases in diabetic plasma in the inactivation of alpha 2-macroglobulin is discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12803541>Gamma III-crystallin is the primary target of glycation in the bovine lens incubated under physiological conditions.</a></h1><p>Several mechanisms have been proposed for the way in which glucose and its metabolites cause cataract, retinopathy and other complications of diabetes, the most convincing being glycation. Glycation, the reaction of sugars with free amino groups of proteins, is one of a variety of non-enzymic post-translational modifications. The aim of the present study was to identify some of the most reactive proteins in the lens when incubated under physiological conditions. Fresh intact bovine lenses were incubated with [14C]glucose in a conventional tissue-culture medium with added antibiotics. After 3 and 6 days of incubation, the water-soluble proteins were separated by size-exclusion chromatography. Glycated proteins from the water-soluble fractions were separated by using a sugar affinity column (Affi-Gel 601). Then the radioactive fractions were identified on SDS/polyacrylamide gels. In addition, the whole bovine lenses were incubated with 10 mM fructose and glucose for 3 and 6 days. The glycated proteins from the water-soluble fractions in parallel with the radioactive fractions were separated by affinity chromatography, and were identified further by amino-acid sequencing. A progressive uptake of radioactive label showed that the majority of proteins incorporating both glucose and fructose were water-soluble fractions. Chromatography and SDS/polyacrylamide gel results showed that alpha- and gamma-crystallin and some proteins of a mean molecular mass of 36-37 kDa incorporated sugars early during incubation. After 6 days of incubation, more crystallins were glycated compared with 3 days, in particular beta-crystallin. Affinity-chromatography results indicated that proteins with subunit masses of 36 kDa and 20 kDa were possibly radiolabelled at an early stage. The purified glycated proteins following incubation with both glucose and fructose, which corresponded to 20 kDa and 36 kDa bands on SDS/polyacrylamide gels, were sequenced by Edman degradation. N-terminal sequences of both 20 kDa bands were Gly-Lys--Thr, characteristic of gamma-crystallins, but the N-termini of both 36 kDa bands were blocked. Further sequencing after digestion of 36 kDa bands with trypsin and running on HPLC revealed that the glucose sample gave the peptide sequences as Gly-Glu-Tyr-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Gln-Gln and Tyr-Glu--Pro-Asn-Tyr-Arg, which match with bovine gammaIIIb-crystallin. The peptide sequence Tyr-Glu--Pro-Asn-Tyr-Arg is only present in the published sequence of bovine gammaIIIb-crystallin and not in any other type of gamma-crystallin. The fructose sample gave the peptide sequences -Thr--Tyr-Glu-Asp-Arg, Arg-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Gln-Gln-Trp, Gln-Tyr---Arg and Val-Val-Asp--Tyr, which all matched with bovine gammaIIIa-crystallin. The sequence Val-Val-Asp--Tyr only appears in the sequence of bovine gammaIIIa-crystallin. gammaIII-Crystallin is the most susceptible lens protein to glycation. The primary target of glucose is gammaIIIb-crystallin, whereas that of fructose is gammaIIIa-crystallin. The early glycation of gammaIII-crystallin by glucose and fructose could result in structural alterations, leading to aggregation of crystallin and eventually cataract formation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27980503>Stability of targeted metabolite profiles of urine samples under different storage conditions.</a></h1><p>Few studies have investigated the influence of storage conditions on urine samples and none of them used targeted mass spectrometry (MS).We investigated the stability of metabolite profiles in urine samples under different storage conditions using targeted metabolomics.Pooled, fasting urine samples were collected and stored at -80 °C (biobank standard), -20 °C (freezer), 4 °C (fridge), ~9 °C (cool pack), and ~20 °C (room temperature) for 0, 2, 8 and 24 h. Metabolite concentrations were quantified with MS using the AbsoluteIDQ™ p150 assay. We used the Welch-Satterthwaite-test to compare the concentrations of each metabolite. Mixed effects linear regression was used to assess the influence of the interaction of storage time and temperature.The concentrations of 63 investigated metabolites were stable at -20 and 4 °C for up to 24 h when compared to samples immediately stored at -80 °C. When stored at ~9 °C for 24 h, few amino acids (Arg, Val and /) significantly decreased by 40% in concentration ( < 7.9E-04); for an additional three metabolites (Ser, Met, Hexose H1) when stored at ~20 °C reduced up to 60% in concentrations. The concentrations of four more metabolites (Glu, , Pro, and Thr) were found to be significantly influenced when considering the interaction between exposure time and temperature.Our findings indicate that 78% of quantified metabolites were stable for all examined storage conditions. Particularly, some amino acid concentrations were sensitive to changes after prolonged storage at room temperature. Shipping or storing urine samples on cool packs or at room temperature for more than 8 h and multiple numbers of freeze and thaw cycles should be avoided.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25561730>Ligand binding pocket formed by evolutionarily conserved residues in the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor core domain.</a></h1><p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) plays a pivotal role in glucose homeostasis through its receptor GLP1R. Due to its multiple beneficial effects, GLP-1 has gained great attention for treatment of type 2 diabetes and . However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction of GLP-1 with the heptahelical core domain of GLP1R conferring high affinity ligand binding and ligand-induced receptor activation. Here, using chimeric and point-mutated GLP1R, we determined that the evolutionarily conserved amino acid residue Arg(380) flanked by hydrophobic (379) and (381) in extracellular loop 3 (ECL3) may have an interaction with Asp(9) and Gly(4) of the GLP-1 peptide. The molecular modeling study showed that (196) at transmembrane helix 2, Met(233) at ECL1, and Asn(302) at ECL2 of GLP1R have contacts with His(1) and Thr(7) of GLP-1. This study may shed light on the mechanism underlying high affinity interaction between the ligand and the binding pocket that is formed by these conserved residues in the GLP1R core domain.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18558553>Effects of nicotinamide supplementation on liver and serum contents of amino acids in diabetic rats.</a></h1><p>Diabetes-related metabolic impairments may be associated with altered protein and amino acid turnover. The goal of the current research was to estimate possible changes in amino acid profiles in rat serum and liver. We also studied whether nicotinamide (NAm), as a drug with the wide range of metabolic effects, can influence metabolic impairments associated with diabetes.After 4 weeks of streptozotocin-induced diabetes (60 mg/kg, i.p.), male Wistar rats were injected for 14 days with or without NAm (100 mg/kg, i.p.). The free amino acids were assayed by cation exchange chromatography. The thiol-active reagent, 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), was used to determine reduced glutathione (GSH).Diabetes was associated with derangement of protein and amino acid metabolism as evidenced by 1.72- and 1.16-fold increase in the total amount of free amino acids in liver and serum and Fischer index (++Val/Tyr+) raised in serum (3.58 vs. 1.73 in control). This was accompanied by increased ratio of essential/nonessential free amino acids, which was more profound in serum. Diabetes led to elevation of hepatic glutamine content, whereas the activity of glutamine synthetase was shown to be decreased. It was also shown a considerable reduction of brain GSH level. Diabetes-related changes in compositions of free amino acids and the ratio of essential/ nonessential free amino acids were partially reversed towards normalisation after NAm supplementation with the efficacy greater in liver than in serum. Furthermore, Fisher index in blood serum was not influenced by drug treatment. NAm exerted slight glucose lowering effect without any effect on decreased body weight in diabetes.The study confirms diabetes-induced derangements in protein and amino acid metabolism in animals. The beneficial effects of NAm on these processes, additionally with other possible contributing factors, may be attributed to metabolic improvements in type I diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22511205>Metabolic signatures of insulin resistance in 7,098 young adults.</a></h1><p>Metabolite associations with insulin resistance were studied in 7,098 young Finns (age 31 ± 3 years; 52% women) to elucidate underlying metabolic pathways. Insulin resistance was assessed by the homeostasis model (HOMA-IR) and circulating metabolites quantified by high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in two population-based cohorts. Associations were analyzed using regression models adjusted for age, waist, and standard lipids. Branched-chain and aromatic amino acids, gluconeogenesis intermediates, ketone bodies, and fatty acid composition and saturation were associated with HOMA-IR (P < 0.0005 for 20 metabolite measures). , , Val, and Tyr displayed sex- and -dependent interactions, with associations being significant for women only if they were abdominally obese. Origins of fasting metabolite levels were studied with dietary and physical activity data. Here, protein energy intake was associated with Val, , Tyr, and Gln but not insulin resistance index. We further tested if 12 genetic variants regulating the metabolites also contributed to insulin resistance. The genetic determinants of metabolite levels were not associated with HOMA-IR, with the exception of a variant in GCKR associated with 12 metabolites, including amino acids (P < 0.0005). Nonetheless, metabolic signatures extending beyond  and lipid abnormalities reflected the degree of insulin resistance evidenced in young, normoglycemic adults with sex-specific fingerprints.</p></html>
