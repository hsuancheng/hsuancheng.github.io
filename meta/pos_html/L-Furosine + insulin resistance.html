However, there have not been any reports concerning its anti-diabetic potential until now. Therefore, we evaluated the anti-diabetic potential of didymin via inhibition of α-glucosidase, protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), rat lens aldose reductase (RLAR), human recombinant AR (HRAR), and advanced glycation end-product (AGE) formation inhibitory assays. Didymin strongly inhibited PTP1B, α-glucosidase, HRAR, RLAR, and AGE in the corresponding assays. Kinetic study revealed that didymin exhibited a mixed type inhibition against α-glucosidase and HRAR, while it competitively inhibited PTP1B and RLAR. Docking simulations of didymin demonstrated negative binding energies and close proximity to residues in the binding pocket of HRAR, RLAR, PTP1B and α-glucosidase, indicating that didymin have high affinity and tight binding capacity towards the active site of these enzymes. Furthermore, we also examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-diabetic effects of didymin in -resistant HepG2 cells which significantly increased glucose uptake and decreased the expression of PTP1B in -resistant HepG2 cells. In addition, didymin activated  receptor substrate (IRS)-1 by increasing phosphorylation at  895 and enhanced the phosphorylations of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and glycogen synthasekinase-3(GSK-3). Interestingly, didymin reduced the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase, two key enzymes involved in the gluconeogenesis and leading to a diminished glucose production. The results of the present study clearly demonstrated that didymin will be useful for developing multiple target-oriented therapeutic modalities for treatment of diabetes, and diabetes-associated complications.© 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29604334>Alternative translation initiation of Caveolin-2 desensitizes  signaling through dephosphorylation of  receptor by PTP1B and causes .</a></h2><p>, defined as attenuated sensitivity responding to , impairs  action.

Recent studies have shown that both are exerted robustly in rodents and humans. If intact, these functions exert beneficial effects on obesity and diabetes, respectively. Disruption of both occurs due to a condition known as hypothalamic , which is caused by obesity and the overconsumption of saturated fat.

Epigenetic mechanisms exert their prime effects in developing cells. We hypothesized that muscle  in LBW subjects may be due to early differential epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations in their immature muscle progenitor cells. : Muscle progenitor cells were obtained from 23 healthy young adult men born at term with LBW, and 15 BMI-matched normal birth weight (NBW) controls.

We aimed to determine central and peripheral  sensitivity in mice that underwent IUGR followed by postnatal catch-up growth and investigate potential molecular mechanisms underpinning their physiology.We used a C57BL/6J mouse model of maternal diet-induced IUGR (maternal diet, 8% protein) followed by cross-fostering to a normal nutrition dam (maternal diet, 20% protein) and litter size manipulation to cause accelerated postnatal catch-up growth. We performed intracerebroventricular  injection and hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp studies to examine the effect of this early nutritional manipulation on central and peripheral .

The aim of this study is to research the relationship of -843A>T (rs2248690) and 767C>G (rs4918) polymorphisms in the alpha-2-Heremans Schmid glycoprotein (AHSG) gene which is responsible for the synthesis of fetuin A and its association with (GDM). In this study, 83 pregnant women with GDM who applied to the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Clinics and 100 normal pregnants enrolled as the control group. Genotyping of AHSG gene polymorphisms was performed by using the TaqMan allelic discrimination kit with real time PCR device. In our study, homozygous GG genotype which was polymorphic in the 767C>G polymorphism of AHSG gene was found significantly low in the patient group ( < .05). Genotype distribution of AHSG gene -843A>T polymorphism was not statistically significant between the patient and control groups ( > .05).

Recent pieces of evidence attributed to UA a causative role in the appearance of diabetes and vascular damage. However, the molecular mechanisms by which UA induces these alterations have not been completely elucidated so far. Among the mechanisms underlying , it was reported the role of a transmembrane glycoprotein, named either ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) or plasma cell antigen 1, which is able to inhibit the function of  receptor (I) and it is overexpressed in -resistant subjects. In keeping with this, we stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with  and UA to investigate the effects of UA on  signaling pathway, testing the hypothesis that UA can interfere with  signaling by the activation of ENPP1. Cultures of HUVECs were stimulated with , UA and the urate transporter SLC22A12 (URAT1) inhibitor probenecid. Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation levels were investigated by immunoblotting. ENPP1 binding to I and its  phosphorylation levels were tested by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. UA inhibited -induced Akt/eNOS axis. Moreover, UA induced ENPP1 binding to I that resulted in an impairment of  signaling cascade. Probenecid reverted UA effects, suggesting that UA intracellular uptake is required for its action. In endothelial cells, UA directly interferes with  signaling pathway at receptor level, through ENPP1 recruitment.

However, not all people benefit from this drug. Our aim was to investigate the effects of metformin on the plasma metabolome and whether the pretreatment metabolite profile can predict HbA outcome.Post hoc analysis of the Copenhagen  and Metformin Therapy (CIMT) trial, a multicentre study from May 2008 to December 2012, was carried out. We used a non-target method to analyse 87 plasma metabolites in participants with Type 2 diabetes (n = 370) who were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to 18 months of metformin or placebo treatment. Metabolites were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry at baseline and at 18-month follow-up and the data were analysed using a linear mixed-effect model.At baseline, participants who were on metformin before the trial (n = 312) had higher levels of leucine/isoleucine and five lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPEs), and lower levels of carnitine and valine compared with metformin-naïve participants (n = 58). At follow-up, participants randomized to metformin (n = 188) had elevated levels of leucine/isoleucine and reduced carnitine,  and valine compared with placebo (n = 182). At baseline, participants on metformin treatment with the highest levels of carnitine C10:1 and leucine/isoleucine had the lowest HbA (P-interaction = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively). This association was not significant with HbA at follow-up.Metformin treatment is associated with decreased levels of valine,  and carnitine, and increased levels of leucine/isoleucine. None of the identified metabolites can predict the HbA -lowering effect of metformin. Further studies of the association between metformin, carnitine and leucine/isoleucine are warranted.© 2018 Diabetes UK.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108319>Targeted SHP-1 Silencing Modulates the Macrophage Phenotype, Leading to Metabolic Improvement in Dietary Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>Chronic over-nutrition promotes adipocyte hypertrophy that creates inflammatory milieu leading to macrophage infiltration and their phenotypic switching during obesity. The SH2 domain-containing protein  phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) has been identified as an important player in inflammatory diseases involving macrophages. However, the role of SHP-1 in modulating the macrophage phenotype has not been elucidated yet. In the present work, we show that adipose tissue macrophage (ATM)-specific deletion of SHP-1 using glucan particle-loaded siRNA improves the metabolic phenotype in dietary obese -resistant mice. The molecular mechanism involves AT remodeling via reducing crown-like structure formation and balancing the pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory macrophage (M2) population. Therefore, targeting ATM-specific SHP-1 using glucan-particle-loaded SHP-1 antagonists could be of immense therapeutic use for the treatment of obesity-associated .Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In the Young Finn's Study, BCAA and, to a lesser extent, the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and  were associated with  (IR) in men but not in women, whereas the gluconeogenic amino acids alanine, glutamine, or glycine, and several other amino acids (i.e. histidine, arginine, and tryptophan) did not show an association with IR. Obesity may track more strongly than metabolic syndrome and diabetes with elevated BCAA. In a study of 1302 people aged 40-79; higher levels of BCAA tracked with older age, male sex, and metabolic syndrome, as well as with obesity, cardiovascular risk, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and uric acid. Medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines, by-products of mitochondrial catabolism of BCAAs, as well as branched-chain keto acids and the BCAA themselves distinguished obese people having versus not having features of IR, and in a study of 898 patients with essential hypertension, the BCAA and  and phenylalanine were associated with metabolic syndrome and impaired fasting glucose. In a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies, elevations in BCAA and, to a lesser extent, in alanine tracked with IR, whereas higher levels of glutamine and glycine were associated with lesser likelihood of IR. Given these associations with IR, it is not surprising that a number of studies have shown higher BCAA levels in people with and prior to development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), although this has particularly been shown in Caucasian and Asian ethnic groups while not appearing to occur in African Americans. Similarly, higher BCAA levels track with cardiovascular disease. [Figure: see text] The metabolism of BCAA involves two processes: (i) a reversible process catalysed by a branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT), either cytosolic or mitochondrial, requiring pyridoxal to function as an amino group carrier, by which the BCAA with 2-ketoglutarate produce a branched-chain keto acid plus glutamate; and (ii) the irreversible mitochondrial process catalysed by branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) leading to formation of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), propionyl-CoA, and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA from leucine, valine, and isoleucine, respectively, which enter the tricarboxylic acid (Krebs) cycle as acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA, respectively, leading to ATP formation. The BCAA stimulate secretion of both  and glucagon and, when given orally, of both glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), with oral administration leading to greater and more prolonged  and glucagon secretion.  may particularly reduce BCAA turnover to a greater extent than that of other amino acids, and decreases the appearance and increases the uptake of amino acids. However, older studies of the effect of glucose or  on BCAA concentrations and rates of leucine appearance and oxidation showed no reduction in T2D, although the higher baseline levels of BCAA in obesity have long been recognized. Impaired function of BCAT and BCKDH has been posited, either as a primary genetic abnormality or due to effects of elevated fatty acids, proinflammatory cytokines, or  levels with consequent accumulation of branched-chain keto acids and metabolites such as diacylglycerol and ceramide, potentially contributing to the development of further , and decreased skeletal muscle BCAT and BCKDH expression has been shown in people with diabetes, supporting this concept. A Mendelian randomization study used measured variation in genes involved in BCAA metabolism to test the hypothesis of a causal effect of modifiable exposure on IR, showing that variants in protein phosphatase, Mg /Mn dependent 1K (PPM1K), a gene encoding the mitochondrial phosphatase activating the BCKDH complex, are associated with T2D, but another such study suggested that genetic variations associated with IR are causally related to higher BCAA levels. Another hypothesis involves the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is activated by BCAA, as well as by  and glucose via cellular ATP availability. If this is the relevant pathway, BCAA overload may cause  by activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), as well as by leading to increases in acylcarnitines, with mTOR seen in this scenario as a central signal of cross-talk between the BCAA and . At this point, whether whole-body or tissue-specific BCAA metabolism is increased or decreased in states of -resistant obesity and T2D is uncertain.  action in the hypothalamus induces but overfeeding decreases hepatic BCKDH, leading to the concept that hypothalamic  impairs BCAA metabolism in obesity and diabetes, so that plasma BCAAs may be markers of hypothalamic  action rather than direct mediators of changes in IR. A way to address this may be to understand the effects of changes in diet and other interventions on BCAA, as well as on IR and T2D. In an animal model, lowering dietary BCAA increased energy expenditure and improved  sensitivity. Two large human population studies showed an association of estimated dietary BCAA intake with T2D risk, although another population study showed higher dietary BCAA to be associated with lower T2D risk. Ethnic differences, reflecting underlying differences in genetic variants, may be responsible for such differences. In the study of Asghari et al. in the current issue of the Journal of Diabetes, BCAA intake was associated with the development of subsequent IR. Studies of bariatric surgery suggest lower basal and post- infusion BCAA levels are associated with greater  sensitivity, with reductions in BCAA not seen with weight loss per se with gastric band procedures, but occurring after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, an intervention that may have metabolic benefits over and above those from reduction in body weight. The gut microbiota may be important for the supply of the BCAA to mammalian hosts, either by de novo biosynthesis or by modifying nutrient absorption. A final fascinating preliminary set of observations is that of the effects of empagliflozin on metabolomics; evidence of increased Krebs cycle activation and of higher levels of BCAA metabolites, such as acylcarnitines, suggests that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition may, to some extent, involve BCAA metabolism. Certainly, we do not yet have a full understanding of these complex associations. However, the suggestion of multiple roles of BCAA in the development of IR promises to be important and to lead to the development of novel effective T2D therapies.© 2018 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31325597>Brain signalling systems: A target for treating type I diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>From early to later stages of Type I Diabetes Mellitus (TIDM), signalling molecules including brain indolamines and protein kinases are altered significantly, and that has been implicated in the Metabolic Disorders (MD) as well as impairment of retinal, renal, neuronal and cardiovascular systems.

However, the specific defects that precipitate these abnormalities are yet to be fully elucidated. After binding to , the plasma membrane-embedded  receptor transmembrane protein initiates a cascade of phosphorylation that leads to the activation of protein kinase B (AKT) and subsequently to the initiation of some metabolic actions of . The activities of this receptor,  binding, and  kinase activation is dependent on its plasma lipid environment. Published data on the influence of omega-3 and -6 polyunsaturated fatty acids on  response are scarce. Moreover, the findings of the published investigations, most of which used omega-3 and -6, polyunsaturated fatty-acid blends, have been inconclusive. Hence, further, well thought out research is needed. The aim of the current study was to elucidate the effect of treatments with linoleic acid (LNA), arachidonic acid (ARA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), docoshexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on cell membrane composition and consequently on the -signaling pathway and specifically AKT phosphorylation.Human colon adenocarcinoma (HT29) and liver hepatocellular (HepG2) cells were treated with or without 40 µM of LNA, ARA, ALA, EPA, or DHA for 48 h, the fatty-acid composition of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) from the treated cells by capillary gas liquid chromatograph. Cells were incubated for 30 min with or without human  (50 ng/mL), and the phosphorylation of AKT was assessed with the use of Western blotting.The fatty acids were incorporated in the PtdCho and PtdEtn of both cell lines, but the level of incorporation was higher in HT29. Phosphorylation of AKT increased when HT29 was treated with LNA (P < 0.05) and ARA (P < 0.01) but not with ALA, EPA, or DHA. A similar but non-significant increase in AKT phosphorylation was observed in LNA- and ARA- treated HepG2 cells.The finding of this investigation demonstrates that plasma membrane lipid bilayer enrichment with LNA or ARA treatment enhances  action by AKT activation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The high frequency of PI3K pathway mutations in many cancers has encouraged a new field targeting cancer driver mutations. Although there have been many successes, targeting PI3K itself has proven challenging, in part because of its multiple isoforms with distinct roles. Despite promising preclinical results, development of PI3K inhibitors as pharmacologic anticancer agents has been limited by modest single-agent efficacy and significant adverse effects. If we could overcome these limitations, PI3K inhibitors would be a powerful cancer-fighting tool. Data from phase III clinical trials yields insight into some of the problems with PI3K inhibitors. Recent advances have shed light on the mechanisms of tumor  to PI3K inhibitors via feedback pathways that cause elevated  levels that then activate the same PI3K pathways that are the targets of inhibition. Improving our understanding of the complex regulatory feedback pathways that activate in response to PI3K inhibition will reveal ways to increase the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors and reduce adverse effects, increasing the usefulness of this class as a treatment option for multiple cancer types.Copyright © 2019 Paddock et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30269067>Impact of bariatric surgery on neural food processing and cognition: an fMRI study.</a></h2><p>The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the most widely used techniques for bariatric surgery.

In the present study, we investigated the role and mechanism underlying Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in TKI  of NSCLCs. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that HCC827 and PC9 cells, non-small cell lung cancer cells with EGFR-activating mutations, became resistant to the EGFR-TKI gefitinib when cultured with CAFs isolated from NSCLC tissues. Moreover, we showed that CAFs could induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype of HCC827 and PC9 cells, with an associated change in the expression of epithelial to mesenchymal transition markers. Using proteomics-based method, we identified that CAFs significantly increased the expression of the Annexin A2 (ANXA2). More importantly, knockdown of ANXA2 completely reversed EMT phenotype and gefitinib  induced by CAFs. Furthermore, we found that CAFs increased the expression and phosphorylation of ANXA2 by secretion of growth factors HGF and IGF-1 and by activation of the corresponding receptors c-met and IGF-1R. Dual inhibition of HGF/c-met and IGF-1/IGF-1R pathways could significantly suppress ANXA2, and markedly reduced CAFs-induced EMT and gefitinib . Taken together, these findings indicate that CAFs promote EGFR-TKIs  through HGF/IGF-1/ANXA2/EMT signaling and may be an ideal therapeutic target in NSCLCs with EGFR-activating mutations.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Receptor-mediated  uptake followed by its degradation constitutes the basic mechanism of  clearance. Upon its phosphorylation by the  receptor  kinase, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) takes part in the - receptor complex to increase the rate of its endocytosis and targeting to the degradation pathways. This review summarizes how this process is regulated and how it is associated with -degrading enzyme in the liver. It also discusses the physiological implications of impaired hepatic  clearance: Whereas reduced  clearance cooperates with increased  secretion to compensate for , it can also cause hepatic . Because chronic hyperinsulinemia stimulates hepatic de novo lipogenesis, impaired  clearance also causes hepatic steatosis. Thus impaired  clearance can underlie the link between hepatic  and hepatic steatosis. Delineating these regulatory pathways should lead to building more effective therapeutic strategies against metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29518003>-Sensitizer Effects of Fenugreek Seeds in Parallel with Changes in Plasma MCH Levels in Healthy Volunteers.</a></h2><p>In developed, developing and low-income countries alike, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common chronic diseases, the severity of which is substantially a consequence of multiple organ complications that occur due to long-term progression of the disease before diagnosis and treatment. Despite enormous investment into the characterization of the disease, its long-term management remains problematic, with those afflicted enduring significant degradation in quality-of-life. Current research efforts into the etiology and pathogenesis of T2DM, are focused on defining aberrations in cellular physiology that result in development of  and strategies for increasing  sensitivity, along with downstream effects on T2DM pathogenesis. Ongoing use of plant-derived naturally occurring materials to delay the onset of the disease or alleviate symptoms is viewed by clinicians as particularly desirable due to well-established efficacy and minimal toxicity of such preparations, along with generally lower per-patient costs, in comparison to many modern pharmaceuticals. A particularly attractive candidate in this respect, is fenugreek, a plant that has been used as a flavouring in human diet through recorded history. The present study assessed the -sensitizing effect of fenugreek seeds in a cohort of human volunteers, and tested a hypothesis that melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) acts as a critical determinant of this effect. A test of the hypothesis was undertaken using a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp approach to assess  sensitivity in response to oral administration of a fenugreek seed preparation to healthy subjects. Outcomes of these evaluations demonstrated significant improvement in glucose tolerance, especially in patients with impaired glucose responses. Outcome data further suggested that fenugreek seed intake-mediated improvement in  sensitivity correlated with reduction in MCH levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31051455>In vitro biological evaluation of anti-diabetic activity of organic-inorganic hybrid gold nanoparticles.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus has been considered as a heterogeneous metabolic disorder characterised by complete or relative impairment in the production of  by pancreatic β-cells or .

Although numerous functions of the polarity protein AF6 (afadin and MLLT4) have been identified, a direct effect on  sensitivity has not been previously described. We show that AF6 is elevated in the liver tissues of dietary and genetic mouse models of diabetes. We generated liver-specific AF6 knockout mice and show that these animals exhibit enhanced  sensitivity and liver glycogen storage, whereas overexpression of AF6 in wild-type mice by adenovirus-expressing AF6 led to the opposite phenotype. Similar observations were obtained from in vitro studies. In addition, we discovered that AF6 directly regulates IRS1/AKT kinase-mediated  signaling through its interaction with Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2) and its regulation of SHP2's  phosphatase activity. Finally, we show that knockdown of hepatic AF6 ameliorates hyperglycemia and  in high-fat diet-fed or  diabetic mice. These results demonstrate a novel function for hepatic AF6 in the regulation of  sensitivity, providing important insights about the metabolic role of AF6.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29427754>Withanolide A extends the lifespan in human EGFR-driven cancerous Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h2><p>The conserved EGFR pathway is linked with multiple cancers in humans including breast, ovarian, and lung carcinoma. Withanolide A, one of the major withanolidal active compounds isolated from the Withania somnifera, extends lifespan and ameliorates stress  in wild-type C. elegans by targeting the /IGF-1 signaling pathway. Up-regulation of IGF1 can transactivate EGFR which inturn reduces longevity and promotes tumor development in an organism. We examined the effects of Withanolide A on the lifespan of a human EGFR-driven C. elegans transgenic model exhibiting the multivulva (Muv) phenotype. The results showed that WA extends the lifespan of both wild human EGFR-driven C. elegans model (human wild-type  kinase) as well as models bearing single (L858R), and double mutations (T790M-L858R). The lifespan extension observed in these transgenic strains was 20.35, 24.21 and 21.27%, respectively. Moreover, the reduced fat levels were noticed in both wild-type N2 worms and transgenic strains. These observations support the heathspan promoting effect of WA as lipid-rich diet has been reported to promote tumor development. In view of the fact that most of the well known FDA approved drugs such as gefitinib fail to inhibit the EGFR-associated cancers because of these mutations, the present findings show the potential of Withanolide A as a foreseen future nutraceutical to improve the average survival of cancer patients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Mg regulates electrical activity and  secretion in pancreatic beta-cells. Intracellular Mg concentrations are critical for the phosphorylation of the  receptor and other downstream signal kinases of the target cells. Low Mg levels result in a defective  kinase activity, post-receptor impairment in  action, altered cellular glucose transport, and decreased cellular glucose utilization, which promotes peripheral IR in T2D.

The rat model of type 2 diabetes was induced by high-fat diet and multiple low-dose streptozotocin injections. Diabetic model rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: the model control group, the metformin group, and Modified Sanzi Yangqin Decoction groups of low, medium, and high doses. OGTT was conducted every two weeks during treatment period. At the end of the treatment, the fasting blood glucose (FBG) level and the fasting C-peptide level were measured to calculate  index.

Besides its role in glucose regulation, glucagon regulates amino acid metabolism in hepatocytes by increasing ureagenesis. Disruption of this mechanism causes hyperaminoacidaemia, which in turn increases glucagon secretion. We hypothesised that hepatic  (secondary to hepatic steatosis) via defective glucagon signalling/glucagon  would lead to impaired ureagenesis and, hence, increased plasma concentrations of glucagonotropic amino acids and, subsequently, glucagon.To examine the association between glucagon and amino acids, and to explore whether this relationship was modified by hepatic , we studied a well-characterised cohort of 1408 individuals with normal and impaired glucose regulation. In this cohort, we have previously reported  to be accompanied by increased plasma concentrations of glucagon. We now measure plasma levels of amino acids in the same cohort. HOMA-IR was calculated as a marker of hepatic .Fasting levels of glucagonotropic amino acids and glucagon were significantly and inversely associated in linear regression models (persisting after adjustment for age, sex and BMI). Increasing levels of hepatic, but not peripheral  (p > 0.166) attenuated the association between glucagon and circulating levels of alanine, glutamine and , and was significantly associated with hyperaminoacidaemia and hyperglucagonaemia. A doubling of the calculated glucagon-alanine index was significantly associated with a 30% increase in hepatic , a 7% increase in plasma alanine aminotransferase levels, and a 14% increase in plasma γ-glutamyltransferase levels.This cross-sectional study supports the existence of a liver-alpha cell axis in humans: glucagon regulates plasma levels of amino acids, which in turn feedback to regulate the secretion of glucagon.

Loss of this adaptation is observed with deficiency of the fatty acid transporter CD36. A similar loss is also characteristic of the -resistant state where CD36 is dysfunctional. To elucidate what links CD36 to muscle glucose utilization, we examined whether CD36 signaling might influence  action. First, we show that CD36 deletion specific to skeletal muscle reduces expression of  signaling and glucose metabolism genes. It decreases muscle ceramides but impairs glucose disposal during a meal. Second, depletion of CD36 suppresses  signaling in primary-derived human myotubes, and the mechanism is shown to involve functional CD36 interaction with the  receptor (IR). CD36 promotes  phosphorylation of IR by the Fyn kinase and enhances IR recruitment of P85 and downstream signaling. Third, pretreatment for 15 min with saturated fatty acids suppresses CD36-Fyn enhancement of IR phosphorylation, whereas unsaturated fatty acids are neutral or stimulatory. These findings define mechanisms important for muscle glucose metabolism and optimal  responsiveness. Potential human relevance is suggested by genome-wide analysis and RNA sequencing data that associate genetically determined low muscle CD36 expression to incidence of type 2 diabetes.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30153591>Ginkgolic acid as a dual-targeting inhibitor for protein  phosphatases relevant to .</a></h2><p>Several protein  phosphatases (PTPs) that disrupt the -signaling pathway were investigated by siRNAs to identify potential antidiabetic targets. Individual knockdown of PTPN9 and DUSP9 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes increased AMPK phosphorylation, respectively, and furthermore, concurrent knockdown of both PTPN9 and DUSP9 synergistically increased AMPK phosphorylation. Next, 658 natural products were screened to identify dual inhibitors of both PTPN9 and DUSP9. Based on the selectivity and inhibition potency of the compounds, ginkgolic acid (GA) was selected for further study as a potential antidiabetic drug candidate. GA inhibited the enzymatic activity of PTPN9 (K = 53 µM) and DUSP9 (K = 2.5 µM) in vitro and resulted in a significant increase of glucose-uptake in differentiated C2C12 muscle cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In addition, GA increased phosphorylation of AMPK in 3T3L1 adipocytes. In this study, GA as a dual targeting inhibitor of PTPN9 and DUSP9 increased glucose uptake in 3T3L1 and C2C12 cells by activating the AMPK signaling pathway.

The main cause of the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus has been found to be . The type 2 diabetes mellitus may be managed by the change in lifestyle, physical activities, dietary modifications and medications. The major currently available management strategies are sulfonylureas, biguanides, thiazolidinediones, α-glucosidase inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist.

The main types of diabetes mellitus are Diabetes mellitus type I, Diabetes mellitus type II, gestational diabetes and Diabetes of other etiology. Diabetes type II, the Non  Dependent Type (NIDDM) is the most common type, characterized by the impairment in activation of the intracellular mechanism leading to the insertion and usage of glucose after interaction of  with its receptor, known as . Although, a number of drugs have been developed for the treatment of diabetes type II, their ability to reduce blood glucose levels is limited, while several side effects are also observed. Furthermore, none of the market drugs targets the enhancement of the action of the intracellular part of  receptor or recuperation of the glucose transport mechanism in GLUT4 dependent cells. The Protein  Phosphatase (PTP1b) is the main enzyme involved in  receptor desensitization and has become a drug target for the treatment of Diabetes type II. Several PTP1b inhibitors have already been found, interacting with the binding site of the enzyme, surrounding the catalytic amino acid Cys215 and the neighboring area or with the allosteric site of the enzyme, placed at a distance of 20 Å from the active site, around Phe280. However, the research continues for finding more potent inhibitors with increased cell permeability and specificity.The aim of this review is to show the attempts made in developing of Protein  Phosphatase (PTP1b) inhibitors with high potency, selectivity and bioavailability and to sum up the indications for favorable structural characteristics of effective PTP1b inhibitors.The methods used include a literature survey and the use of Protein Structure Databanks such as PuBMed Structure and RCSB and the tools they provide.The research for finding PTP1b inhibitors started with the design of molecules mimicking the  substrate of the enzyme. The study revealed that an aromatic ring connected to a polar group, which preferably enables hydrogen bond formation, is the minimum requirement for small inhibitors binding to the active site surrounding Cys215. Molecules bearing two hydrogen bond donor/acceptor (Hb d/a) groups at a distance of 8.5-11.5 Å may form more stable complexes, interacting simultaneously with a secondary area A2. Longer molecules with two Hb d/a groups at a distance of 17 Å or 19 Å may enable additional interactions with secondary sites (B and C) that confer stability as well as specificity. An aromatic ring linked to polar or Hb d/a moieties is also required for allosteric inhibitors. A lower distance between Hb d/a moieties, around 7.5 Å may favor allosteric interaction. Permanent inhibition of the enzyme by oxidation of the catalytic Cys215 has also been referred. Moreover, covalent modification of Cys121, placed near but not inside the catalytic pocket has been associated with permanent inhibition of the enzyme.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29423494>EGCG evokes Nrf2 nuclear translocation and dampens PTP1B expression to ameliorate metabolic misalignment under  condition.</a></h2><p>As a major nutraceutical component of green tea (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has attracted interest from scientists due to its well-documented antioxidant and antiobesity bioactivities. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the protective effect of EGCG on metabolic misalignment and in balancing the redox status in mice liver and HepG2 cells under  condition. Our results indicated that EGCG accelerates the glucose uptake and evokes IRS-1/Akt/GLUT2 signaling pathway via dampening the expression of protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). Consistently, ectopic expression of PTP1B by Ad-PTP1B substantially impaired EGCG-elicited IRS-1/Akt/GLUT2 signaling pathway. Moreover, EGCG co-treatment stimulated nuclear translocation of Nrf2 by provoking P13K/AKT signaling pathway and thus modulated the downstream expressions of antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1 and NQO-1 in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, knockdown Nrf2 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) notably enhanced the expression of PTP1B and blunt EGCG-stimulated glucose uptake. Consistent with these results, in vivo study revealed that EGCG supplement significantly ameliorated high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD)-triggered  and oxidative stress by up-regulating the IRS-1/AKT and Keap1/Nrf2 transcriptional pathways.

We report that elevated PTP1B and TCPTP antagonize hypothalamic leptin and  signaling and contribute to the maintenance of obesity. Deletion of PTP1B and TCPTP in the hypothalami of obese mice enhances CNS leptin and  sensitivity, represses feeding, and increases browning, to decrease adiposity and improve glucose metabolism. The daily intranasal administration of a PTP1B inhibitor, plus the glucocorticoid antagonist RU486 that decreases TCPTP expression, represses feeding, increases browning, promotes weight loss, and improves glucose metabolism in obese mice. Our findings causally link heightened hypothalamic PTP1B and TCPTP with leptin and  and the maintenance of obesity and define a viable pharmacological approach by which to promote weight loss in obesity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Body weight, daily food intake, fasting blood glucose level, fasting  level,  index, and fasting serum concentrations of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide   (PYY), and bile acid were measured. In addition, postoperative changes in body weight and daily food intake at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks were also recorded. At week 12, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and  release test were performed to determine glucose tolerance. The  index (IRI) was also measured. The postprandial secretion curves and area under the curve (AUC) of GLP-1, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), PYY, and bile acid were also calculated.Before surgery, no significant differences in body weight, daily food intake, fasting blood glucose, fasting ,  index, fasting GLP-1, PYY, and bile acid were found among the three groups (P > 0.05). At postoperative week 12, body weight and food intake in the SG and GCP-DJB groups were lower than those in the Control group (P < 0.05), and body weight in the GCP-DJB group was lowest (P < 0.05). Glucose tolerance, postprandial serum  (INS), GLP-1, PYY, and bile acid were significantly higher in the SG and GCP-DJB groups than in the Control group (P < 0.05). The parameters related to glucose metabolism in the GCP-DJB group were higher than those in the SG group with the exception of serum  (P < 0.05). In addition, IRI and GIP secretion were significantly lower in the SG and GCP-DJB groups than in the Control group (P < 0.05) and were lowest in the GCP-DJB group (P < 0.05).Both GCP-DJB and SG are surgical options for the treatment of T2DM. The underlying mechanism of these treatments may be related to the decrease in body weight, food intake, GIP, IRI, and the increase in INS, GLP-1, PYY, and bile acid. According to the various metabolic indicators related to the hypoglycemic effects in T2DM, GCP-DJB was superior to SG.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29393871>Combination Treatment of Deep Sea Water and Fucoidan Attenuates High Glucose-Induced  in HepG2 Hepatocytes.</a></h2><p> (IR) plays a central role in the development of several metabolic diseases, which leads to increased morbidity and mortality rates, in addition to soaring health-care costs. Deep sea water (DSW) and fucoidans (FPS) have drawn much attention in recent years because of their potential medical and pharmaceutical applications. This study investigated the effects and mechanisms of combination treatment of DSW and FPS in improving IR in HepG2 hepatocytes induced by a high glucose concentration. The results elucidated that co-treatment with DSW and FPS could synergistically repress hepatic glucose production and increase the glycogen level in IR-HepG2 cells. In addition, they stimulated the phosphorylation levels of the components of the  signaling pathway, including  phosphorylation of IRS-1, and serine phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β. Furthermore, they increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC, which in turn decreased the intracellular triglyceride level. Taken together, these results suggested that co-treatment with DSW and FPS had a greater improving effect than DSW or FPS alone on IR. They might attenuate IR by targeting Akt/GSK-3β and AMPK pathways. These results may have some implications in the treatment of metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31271659>Changes in whole metabolites after exenatide treatment in overweight/obese polycystic ovary syndrome patients.</a></h2><p>Exenatide is a new agent for diabetes therapy, and its use in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has gradually increased; however, the clinical benefit and metabolic improvement need further evidence. This research aimed to study the changes in whole metabolites before and after exenatide treatment in overweight/obese PCOS patients to gain a better understanding of exenatide for the treatment of PCOS.Sixty-seven women, including 32 with PCOS and 35 age-matched controls, were recruited. The metabolite changes were detected with nontargeted gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (NTGC-MS) before and after exenatide treatment, and changes in clinical biochemical characteristics were also observed.A total of 62 metabolites were differentially expressed between the healthy and PCOS groups, and 31 differentially expressed metabolites were detected before and after exenatide treatment. Abnormal lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism were the main metabolic disorders. Exenatide improved lipid and amino acid metabolism, especially amino acid metabolites. Three types of branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine and isoleucine), two types of aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine and ) and lysine are important potential metabolites for the therapeutic efficacy of exenatide. Many abnormal metabolic disorders are related to , oxidative stress and even ovulatory dysfunction. Moreover, in this small sample clinical study, we also found that exenatide improved  sensitivity, reduced body weight and improved glycolipid metabolism in PCOS.NTGC-MS-based metabolic pathway analysis revealed that exenatide has a beneficial effect on overweight/obese PCOS patients by regulating metabolic disorders, especially amino acid disorders.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30202213>A comprehensive review on Brigatinib - A wonder drug for targeted cancer therapy in non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>The mortality rate in patients suffering from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is quite high. This type of cancer mainly occurs due to rearrangements in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene which leads to form an oncogene of fused gene NPM-ALK. Brigatinib is recently approved by FDA in April 2017 as a potent  kinase inhibitor (TKI) for the NSCLC therapy. In the present scenario, it is no less than a wonder drug because it is indicated for the treatment of advanced stages of metastatic ALK positive NSCLC, a fatal disease to overcome the  of various other ALK inhibitors such as crizotinib, ceritinib and alectinib. In addition to ALK, it is also active against multiple types of kinases such as ROS1,  like growth factor-1Receptor and EGFR. It can be synthesized by using -[2-methoxy-4-[4-(dimethylamino) piperidin-1-yl] aniline] guanidine and 2,4,5-trichloropyrimidine respectively in two different ways. Its structure consists of mainly dimethylphosphine oxide group which is responsible for its pharmacological activity. It is active against various cell lines such as HCC78, H2228, H23, H358, H838, U937, HepG2 and Karpas- 299. Results of ALTA (ALK in Lung Cancer Trial of AP26113) phase ½ trial shows that 90 mg of brigatinib for 7 days and then 180 mg for next days is effective in the treatment of NSCLC. Brigatinib has been shown to have favorable risk benefit profile and is a safer drug than the available cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. In comparison to other FDA approved drugs for the same condition, it causes fewer minor adverse reactions which can be easily managed either by changing the dose or by providing good supportive care. This article is intended to provide readers with an overview of chemistry, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety profile of brigatinib, which addresses an unmet medical need.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30381640>[Elucidation of a New Mechanism of Onset of : Effects of Statins and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α on  Signal Transduction].</a></h2><p>Impaired  signaling in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle causes  associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying  remain to be elucidated. In this review, we describe the current understanding of the effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α on  signal transduction in adipocytes. First, we determined that atorvastatin inhibits the  phosphorylation of  receptor substrate (IRS)-1 through a decrease in the RhoA-Rho-kinase pathway, resulting in the inhibition of glucose uptake. Second, we found that TNF-α induces IRS-1 phosphorylation at serine residues 636/639 and inhibits the  phosphorylation of IRS-1 through the increase in both extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation. Interestingly, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside, an AMP-activated protein kinase activator, suppresses TNF-α-induced IRS-1 serine phosphorylation at 636/639 and the phosphorylation of ERK by enhancing interactions between ERK and dual-specificity phosphatase-9.

This mechanistic link may involve alterations in the glutathione redox state. We examined the effect of glycine supplementation to diet on glutathione biosynthesis, oxidative stress, IR, and  cell signaling in liver from sucrose-fed (SF) rats characterized by IR and oxidative stress. Our hypothesis is that the correction of glutathione levels by glycine treatment leads to reduced oxidative stress, a mechanism associated with improved  signaling and IR. Glycine treatment decreases the levels of oxidative stress markers in liver from SF rats and increases the concentrations of glutathione (GSH) and -glutamylcysteine and the amount of -glutamylcysteine synthetase (-GCS), a key enzyme of GSH biosynthesis in liver from SF rats. In liver from SF rats, glycine also decreases the -induced phosphorylation of  receptor substrate-1 (ISR-1) in serine residue and increases the phosphorylation of  receptor -subunit (IR-) in  residue. Thus, supplementing diets with glycine to correct GSH deficiency and to reduce oxidative stress provides significant metabolic benefits to SF rats by improving  sensitivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29955954>Egg white hydrolysate and peptide reverse  associated with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in skeletal muscle cells.</a></h2><p>Excessive formation of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, has been implicated in the development of  in obesity and type-2 diabetes.

In addition, TNF-α-induced activation of p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) 1/2 were decreased by either EWH or IRW treatment.EWH and IRW improve impaired  sensitivity by down-regulating the activation of p38 and JNK1/2 in TNF-α-treated skeletal muscle cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29739273>Angiogenic Dysregulation in Pregnancy-Related Hypertension-A Role for Metformin.</a></h2><p>In the face of escalating maternal and fetal health threats, hypertensive pregnancy disorders (HPDs) is one of the leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The range of HPDs include white-coat hypertension, chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, mild-to-moderate and severe preeclampsia and eclampsia. Current evidence implicates an imbalance of circulating anti- and angiogenic factors in HPDs emanating from the placental vasculature, impacting on angiogenesis. Delivery of the fetus is thus far the only curative measure, albeit with increased risk. Resultant endothelial dysfunction caused by the excessive production of placental soluble fms-like  kinase-1 has been the basis of many studies to find a safer treatment strategy. Metformin, used historically in the treatment of diabetes mellitus has also found its therapeutic reach in many other disease states. These include, but are not limited to, improving blood flow in certain cancer types, treatment of polycystic ovarian disease, improving vasodilation, and reducing inflammation. Metformin is used to treat hyperglycemic endothelial dysfunction through the enhancement of the nitric oxide system, endothelin-derived hyperpolarizing factor and sirtuin 1. Similarly, endothelial dysfunction in preeclampsia and other HPDs leads to a hypoxic state and elevated blood pressures. Dubbed as the new "aspirin" of current times, the retardation of the antiangiogenic status by metformin provides an exciting and promising alternate strategy in treating these pregnancy disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29247200>Association of plasma free amino acids with hyperuricemia in relation to diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension and metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Previous studies demonstrated independent contributions of plasma free amino acids (PFAAs) and high uric acid (UA) concentrations to increased risks of lifestyle-related diseases (LSRDs), but the important associations between these factors and LSRDs remain unknown. We quantified PFAAs and UA amongst Japanese subjects without LSRDs (no-LSRD, n = 2805), and with diabetes mellitus (DM, n = 415), dyslipidemia (n = 3207), hypertension (n = 2736) and metabolic syndrome (MetS, n = 717). The concentrations of most amino acids differed significantly between the subjects with and without hyperuricemia (HU) and also between the no-LSRD and LSRD groups (p < 0.05 to 0.001). After adjustment, the logistic regression analyses revealed that lysine in DM, alanine, proline and  in dyslipidemia, histidine, lysine and ornithine in hypertension, and lysine and  in MetS demonstrated significant positive associations with HU among the patients with LSRDs only (p < 0.05 to 0.005). By contrast, arginine, asparagine and threonine showed significant inverse associations with HU in the no-LSRD group only (p < 0.05 to 0.01). For the first time, we provide evidence for distinct patterns of association between PFAAs and HU in LSRDs, and postulate the possibility of interplay between PFAAs and UA in their pathophysiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29903737>Inactivation of the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase IDOL Attenuates Diet-Induced Obesity and Metabolic Dysfunction in Mice.</a></h2><p>Objective- The E3 ubiquitin ligase IDOL (inducible degrader of the LDLR [LDL (low-density lipoprotein) receptor]) is a post-transcriptional regulator of LDLR abundance. Model systems and human genetics support a role for IDOL in regulating circulating LDL levels. Whether IDOL plays a broader metabolic role and affects development of metabolic syndrome-associated comorbidities is unknown. Approach and Results- We studied WT (wild type) and Idol (Idol-KO) mice in 2 models: physiological aging and diet-induced obesity. In both models, deletion of Idol protected mice from metabolic dysfunction. On a Western-type diet, Idol loss resulted in decreased circulating levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and . This was accompanied by protection from weight gain in short- and long-term dietary challenges, which could be attributed to reduced hepatosteatosis and fat mass in Idol-KO mice. Although feeding and intestinal fat uptake were unchanged in Idol-KO mice, their brown adipose tissue was protected from lipid accumulation and had elevated expression of UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1) and TH ( hydroxylase). Indirect calorimetry indicated a marked increase in locomotion and suggested a trend toward increased cumulative energy expenditure and fat oxidation. An increase in in vivo clearance of reconstituted lipoprotein particles in Idol-KO mice may sustain this energetic demand. In the BXD mouse genetic reference population, hepatic Idol expression correlates with multiple metabolic parameters, thus providing support for findings in the Idol-KO mice. Conclusions- Our study uncovers an unrecognized role for Idol in regulation of whole body metabolism in physiological aging and on a Western-type diet. These findings support Idol inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to target multiple metabolic syndrome-associated comorbidities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30897341>Low-intensity exercise in the prevention of cardiac -related inflammation and disturbances in NOS and MMP-9 regulation in fructose-fed ovariectomized rats.</a></h2><p>Exercise is important nonpharmacological treatment for improvement of  sensitivity in menopause. However, its effect on menopausal cardiac  is needing further research. We investigated protective effects of low-intensity exercise on cardiac  signaling, inflammation, regulation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in ovariectomized (OVX) Wistar rats, submitted to 10% fructose solution for 9 weeks. OVX rats were divided into control, sedentary fructose, and exercise fructose groups. Measurements of physical and biochemical characteristics were carried out to evaluate metabolic syndrome development. Messenger RNA and protein levels and phosphorylation of cardiac  signaling molecules, endothelial and inducible NOS (eNOS and iNOS), p65 subunit of nuclear factor κB (NFκB), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), and MMP-9 were analyzed. Fructose increased  level, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index, and visceral adipose tissue weight, while low-intensity exercise prevented  level and HOMA index increase. Fructose also decreased cardiac pAkt (Ser473), peNOS (Ser1177) and increased  receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) phosphorylation at Ser307, pNFκB (Ser276) and NFκB and MMP-9 content, without any effect on iNOS, protein- phosphatase 1B, TNF-α, and SOCS3. Exercise prevented changes in pIRS1 (Ser307), pAkt (Ser473), peNOS (Ser1177), pNFκB (Ser276), and NFκB expression. In addition, exercise increased pIRS1 (Tyr632), pAkt (Thr308), and eNOS expression. Low-intensity exercise prevented cardiac  signaling disarrangement in fructose-fed OVX rats and therefore eNOS dysfunction, as well as pro-inflammatory signaling activation, without effect on tissue remodeling, suggesting physical training as a way to reduce cardiovascular risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30885989>Nine Amino Acids Are Associated With Decreased  Secretion and Elevated Glucose Levels in a 7.4-Year Follow-up Study of 5,181 Finnish Men.</a></h2><p>Several amino acids (AAs) have been shown to be associated with  and increased risk of type 2 diabetes, but no previous studies have investigated the association of AAs with  secretion in a longitudinal setting.

But the mechanism is not clearly known. The present study was designed to explore the effect of subtoxic DDT exposure on (1) -stimulated glucose uptake, (2) malondialdehyde (MDA) level and total antioxidant content, (3) activation of redox sensitive kinases (RSKs), and (4)  signaling in rat L6 myoblast-derived myotubes. Exposure to 30 mg/L and 60 mg/L of DDT for 18 hours dose dependently decreased glucose uptake and antioxidant content in myotubes and increased MDA levels. The exposures did not alter tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) level as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, despite decreased messenger RNA expression following DDT exposures. Phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases and IκBα, an inhibitory component of nuclear factor κB (NFκB), was increased, suggesting activation of RSKs. The level of  phosphorylation of  receptor substrate 1 and serine phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) on  stimulation decreased in myotubes with exposure to subtoxic concentrations of DDT, but there was no change in  phosphorylation level of  receptors. We conclude that subtoxic DDT exposure impairs  signaling and thereby induces  in muscle cells.

The crustacean hepatopancreas (H) is a metabolic organ that plays important functions including absorption, storage of nutrients and vitellogenesis during growth and ovarian development. However, genetic information on the biological functions of the crustacean ovaries and hepatopancreas are limited. This study compared the transcriptome in the ovary and the hepatopancreas of female P. trituberculatus fed two different diets containing 0% (SL0) and 4% soybean lecithin (SL4), respectively during the growth and ovarian maturation stages by Illumina HiSeq4000 sequencer. The differences between ovary and hepatopancreas of P. trituberculatus were also compared at transcriptional level. A total of 55,667 unigenes were obtained with mean length of 962 bps across the four treatment groups (SL0_O, SL4_O, SL0_H and SL4_H). In ovary, there were 257 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between SL0_O and SL4_O, with 145 down- and 112 up-regulated genes in the SL4_O group. Candidate genes involved in ovarian development were detected in SL4_H group. In hepatopancreas, 146 DEGs were found between SL0_H and SL4_H, including 43 down- and 103 up-regulated genes in the SL4_H group. The specific DEGs were mainly involved with lipid related metabolism pathways, including fat digestion and absorption, PPAR signaling pathway and . 14,725 DEGs were found in the comparison between SL0_O and SL4_H, including 7250 up- and 7475 down-regulated genes in the SL4_H group. The specific DEGs were mainly involved with lipid (fat digestion and absorption, linoleic acid metabolism), hormone (steroid hormone biosynthesis, ovarian steroidogenesis, etc), and amino acid (phenylalanine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, ) related metabolism pathways. Crabs fed the SL4 diet exhibited higher gene expression of cryptocyanin 1 (cc1), cryptocyanin 2 (cc2) and neuroparsin 1 (np1) in hepatopancreas and ovarian than those fed the SL0 diet, however, crab fed SL4 diet showed higher gene expression of fatty acid-binding protein 1 (fabp1), vitellogenin (vtg) and Delta-6 desaturase-like protein (fadsd6) in hepatopancreas than those fed the SL0 diet. Moreover, crabs fed the SL0 diet had lower gene expression of vtg, extracellular copper‑zinc superoxide dismutase (cuznsod) and estrogen sulfotransferase (ests) in ovary compared to those fed the diet containing 4% soybean lecithin.

The impaired fat oxidation in obesity condition leads to increased hepatic fat accumulation and increased metabolic syndrome risk. On the other hand, physical exercise has been demonstrated as a potent strategy in the prevention of NAFLD. Also, these beneficial effects of exercise occur through different mechanisms. Recently, the Cdc2-like kinase (CLK2) protein was associated with the suppression of fatty acid oxidation and hepatic ketogenesis. Thus, obese animals demonstrated elevated levels of hepatic CLK2 and decreased fat acid oxidation. Here, we explored the effects of chronic physical exercise in the hepatic metabolism of obese mice. Swiss mice were distributed in Lean, Obese (fed with high-fat diet during 16 weeks) and Trained Obese group (fed with high-fat diet during 16 weeks and exercised (at 60% exhaustion velocity during 1 h/5 days/week) during 8 weeks. In our results, the obese animals showed , increased hepatic CLK2 content and increased hepatic fat accumulation compared to the Lean group. Otherwise, the chronic physical exercise improved  state, prevented the increased CLK2 in the liver and attenuated hepatic fat accumulation. In summary, these data reveal a new protein involved in the prevention of hepatic fat accumulation after chronic physical exercise. More studies can evidence the negative role of CLK2 in the control of liver metabolism, contributing to the improvement of , obesity, and type 2 diabetes.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428789>Branched chain amino acids, cardiometabolic risk factors and outcomes in older men: the Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project.</a></h2><p>Increased blood levels of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) have been associated with cardiometabolic risk factors. Here we studied 918 community dwelling older men to determine the relationship between BCAAs and other amino acids with cardiometabolic risk factors, major cardiovascular endpoints (MACE) and mortality. BCAAs had robust associations with many adverse metabolic risk factors (increased glucose, , Homeostatic Model Assessment for  (HOMA-IR), triglycerides; decreased HDL cholesterol). However, paradoxically, participants with lower levels of BCAAs had greater mortality and MACE possibly because increasing age and frailty, both of which were associated with lower BCAA levels, are powerful risk factors for these outcomes in older people. Overall, amino acids that were lowest in frail subjects (BCAAs, α-aminobutyric acid (AABA), histidine, lysine, methionine, threonine, ) were inversely associated with mortality and MACE. In conclusion, BCAAs are biomarkers for important outcomes in older people including cardiometabolic risk factors, frailty and mortality. In old age, frailty becomes a dominant risk factor for MACE and mortality.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.

We have shown previously that CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress and circulating leptin in NAFLD is associated with renal disease severity. Extending the studies, we hypothesized that high circulatory leptin in NAFLD causes renal mesangial cell activation and tubular inflammation via a NOX2 dependent pathway that upregulates proinflammatory miR21. High-fat diet (60% kcal) was used to induce fatty liver phenotype with parallel  and leptin . The kidneys were probed for mesangial cell activation and tubular inflammation that showed accelerated NASH phenotype and oxidative stress in the liver. Results showed that NAFLD kidneys had significant increases in α-SMA, a marker of mesangial cell activation, miR21 levels,  nitration and renal inflammation while they were significantly decreased in leptin and p47 phox knockout mice. Micro RNA21 knockout mice showed decreased tubular immunotoxicity and proinflammatory mediator release. Mechanistically, use of NOX2 siRNA or apocynin,phenyl boronic acid (FBA), DMPO or miR21 antagomir inhibited leptin primed-miR21-mediated mesangial cell activation in vitro suggesting a direct role of leptin-mediated NOX-2 in miR21-mediated mesangial cell activation. Finally, JAK-STAT inhibitor completely abrogated the mesangial cell activation in leptin-primed cells suggesting that leptin signaling in the mesangial cells depended on the JAK-STAT pathway. Taken together the study reports a novel mechanistic pathway of leptin-mediated renal inflammation that is dependent on NOX-2-miR21 axis in ectopic manifestations underlying NAFLD-induced co-morbidities.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

As measured from band density of WB, phosphorylation levels increased for redo-sensitive kinases (p38MAPK and IκBα component of NFκB) and decreased for IRS-1 (at  1222) and Akt (at serine 473) on  stimulation following chlorpyrifos exposure as compared to those in controls.We conclude that sub-toxic chlorpyrifos exposure induces oxidative stress in muscle cells activating redox sensitive kinases that impairs  signaling and thereby -stimulated glucose uptake in muscle cells. This probably explains the biochemical basis of chlorpyrifos-induced  state and diabetes mellitus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29559272>Amino acid levels in nascent metabolic syndrome: A contributor to the pro-inflammatory burden.</a></h2><p>Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of cardio-metabolic risk factors characterized by low-grade inflammation which confers an increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Prior studies have linked elevated branched chain amino acids (BCAA) and aromatic amino acids (AAA) with T2DM and CVD. Due to the paucity of data in MetS, the aim of this study was to investigate the status of amino acids as early biomarkers of nascent MetS patients without T2DM and CVD or smoking.Healthy controls (n = 20) and MetS (n = 29) patients were recruited for the study. MetS was defined by criteria of National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III of having at least 3 risk factors. Urinary amino acids were quantified by gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry at the Western NIH Metabolomics Center as expressed to urinary creatinine. and Isoleucine levels were significantly elevated in MetS patients. Isoleucine positively correlated with salient cardio-metabolic features and inflammatory biomarkers. Lysine and Methionine levels were decreased in MetS patients. Lysine correlated negatively with cardio-metabolic features and inflammatory bimarkers. Methionine also correlated negatively with blood pressure and certain inflammatory biomarkers.Our novel results suggest that with regards to the cardio-metabolic risk factors and pro-inflammatory features of MetS, isoleucine (BCAA) demonstrated a positive correlation while lysine demonstrated a negative correlation. Thus, increased levels of isoleucine and decreased levels of lysine could be potential early biomarkers of MetS.Copyright © 2018.

In vitro studies have demonstrated that BVR-A is a substrate of the  receptor and regulates IRS1 by avoiding its aberrant activation, and in animal model of obesity the loss of hepatic BVR-A has been associated with glucose/ alterations and fatty liver disease. However, no studies exist in humans. Here, we evaluated BVR-A expression levels and activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from obese subjects and matched lean controls and we investigated the related molecular alterations of the  along with clinical correlates. We showed that BVR-A levels are significantly reduced in obese subjects and associated with a hyper-activation of the IR/IRS1/Akt/GSK-3β/AS160/GLUT4 pathway. Low BVR-A levels also associate with the presence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, NASH and visceral adipose tissue inflammation. These data suggest that the reduction of BVR-A may be responsible for early alterations of the  signaling pathway in obesity and in this context may represent a novel molecular target to be investigated for the comprehension of the process of  development in obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report the nuclear expression of -like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) in primary human lung tumours. Using lung cancer cell lines and lung tumour xenografts, we demonstrate that the epidermal growth factor receptor- kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) gefitinib induces the nuclear accumulation of IGF1R in mucinous lung adenocarcinoma by a mechanism involving the intracellular re-localization of the growth factor amphiregulin. Amphiregulin allows the binding of IGF1R to importin-β1 and promotes its nuclear transport. The nuclear accumulation of IGF1R by amphiregulin induces cell cycle arrest through p21 upregulation, and prevents the induction of apoptosis in response to gefitinib. These results identify amphiregulin as the first nuclear localization signal-containing protein that interacts with IGF1R and allows its nuclear translocation. Furthermore they indicate that nuclear expression of IGF1R contributes to EGFR-TKI  in lung cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This study assessed the associations of postabsorptive AAs with IR directly measured by -mediated glucose disposal and determined the quantitative value of AAs and conventional IR predictors.Fifty-one healthy, 31 overweight or obese (Ow/Ob), and 52 men and women with type 2 diabetes (T2D) were studied retrospectively. The main outcome measures were the glucose disposal (M/I) index (using 3-[H]-glucose) during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and whole-body protein turnover (using 1-[C]-leucine).Compared with healthy participants, M/I was lower in Ow/Ob participants and lowest in those with T2D. BCAAs, glutamate, and lysine were higher in the Ow/Ob and T2D groups than in healthy participants; glycine and threonine were lower. Most AAs were higher in men. Principal component analysis identified component 1 (C1: BCAAs, methionine) and C3 (glycine, threonine, serine). Glutamate, C1, ornithine, lysine, methionine, and  correlated negatively with M/I; C3 and glycine correlated positively. Waist circumference and sex strongly influenced AA-IR relationships; only glutamate correlated after these factors were controlled for. From regression analysis, waist circumference, fasting glucose, , and free fatty acids (FFAs) negatively predicted 64% of the M/I variance; glutamate added 2% more. In nondiabetic participants, IR was predicted by waist circumference, , and FFAs, without contribution from AAs.Several postabsorptive AAs correlated with IR but added limited predictive value to conventional markers because levels were determined largely by abdominal adiposity.

For these reasons, drugs that target more than one protein (polypharmacology) can be clinically advantageous. The discovery of useful polypharmacology remains serendipitous and is challenging to characterize and validate. In this study, we developed a non-genetic strategy for the identification of pathways that drive cancer cell proliferation and represent exploitable signaling vulnerabilities. Our approach is based on using a multitargeted kinase inhibitor, SM1-71, as a tool compound to identify combinations of targets whose simultaneous inhibition elicits a potent cytotoxic effect. As a proof of concept, we applied this approach to a KRAS-dependent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line, H23-KRAS Using a combination of phenotypic screens, signaling analyses, and kinase inhibitors, we found that dual inhibition of MEK1/2 and -like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R)/ receptor (INSR) is critical for blocking proliferation in cells. Our work supports the value of multitargeted tool compounds with well-validated polypharmacology and target space as tools to discover kinase dependences in cancer. We propose that the strategy described here is complementary to existing genetics-based approaches, generalizable to other systems, and enabling for future mechanistic and translational studies of polypharmacology in the context of signaling vulnerabilities in cancers.© 2019 Rao et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29845261>Candesartan targeting of angiotensin II type 1 receptor demonstrates benefits for hypertension in pregnancy via the NF‑κB signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Hypertensive disorders may be a complication of pregnancy and are characterized by the high blood pressure. Evidence suggests that alterations in the renin‑angiotensin‑aldosterone system and the sympathetic nervous system are associated with gestational hypertension. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (Ang‑IITR) is a potential target in the progression of gestational hypertension. Candesartan is selective Ang‑IITR antagonist that may act against vasoconstriction and reduces peripheral vascular . The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of Candesartan and the underlying molecular mechanism of the nuclear factor‑κB (NF‑κB) signaling pathway in the progression of gestational hypertension in a mouse model. Expression and activity of Ang‑IITR was evaluated in a mouse model of gestational hypertension prior to and post‑treatment of Candesartan both in vitro and in vivo. It was determined whether Candesartan treatment reduces higher blood pressure activated the renal renin‑angiotensin system and a prognostic marker, soluble endoglin, and its associated gene in mice with gestational hypertension. Angiotensin‑converting enzyme plasma levels and activity were also evaluated in the present study. Cytoplasmic and nuclear immunostaining of NF‑κB and associated proteins transforming growth factor β (TGF‑β) and endoglin was enhanced in vascular endothelial cells and mice with gestational hypertension. Soluble fms‑like  kinase 1 (sFlt‑1),  homeostasis model assessment score and associated cardiovascular risk factors also were measured. Results demonstrated that angiotensin and Ang‑IITR expression levels were upregulated in mice with gestational hypertension and were downregulated by Candesartan treatment. Renal renin‑angiotensin and soluble endoglin were also improved in mice in the Candesartan‑treated group. In addition, Candesartan treatment enhanced NF‑κB activity, as well as TGF‑β and vascular endothelial growth factor expression which led to improved levels of sFlt‑1,  homeostasis and associated cardiovascular risk factors. Gestational hypertension was markedly improved by treatment of Candesartan compared with the control.

NlInR1 is strikingly homologous to the typical InR in insects and vertebrates, containing a ligand-activated intracellular  kinase catalytic domain. Herein, we report an optimized CRISPR/Cas9 system to induce mutations in the NlInR1 locus in BPH, consisting of a Cas9 plasmid that is specifically expressed in the germline via the Nlvasa promoter and versatile sgRNA expression plasmids under the control of the U6 promoter. We systematically evaluated the efficiency of injection mix compositions and demonstrated an appropriate combination of Cas9/sgRNA to target essential genes. Furthermore, we showed that homozygous mutants for the NlInR1 gene are early embryonic lethal, whereas heterozygous mutants grow more slowly, exhibit a severe reduction in body weight and wing size and live longer than the wild type. Interestingly, the severity of the mutant phenotype was different when targeting distinct important domains of the NlInR1 locus. The severity of the mutant phenotype is similar to that of /-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway deficiencies in vertebrates, suggesting a conserved function of NlInR1 in the regulation of development and longevity. Global expression profiling suggests that NlInR1 regulates many cellular processes in BPH, including , phototransduction, metabolism, endocytosis, longevity, biosynthesis and protein processing.

Consequently, disproportionate levels of ROS in relation to antioxidants lead to oxidative stress (OS), which plays a key role in HIV disease progression and pathogenesis. There is a close relationship between oxidative stress status and HIV infection/progression, both separately and in the presence of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Biomarkers of oxidative stress present an additional means of monitoring HIV disease progression and/or management. Thus, the objective of this study was to apply untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomics followed by targeted quantitative gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses to identify predictors of oxidative stress in HIV infected individuals, with or without cART. Untargeted NMR-based metabonomics allowed a global profiling of metabolic perturbations in HIV-infected sera. The cohort consisted of 21 HIV-negative control subjects (HIV) and 113 HIV-infected individuals, of which 100 were on cART. Significant differences in metabolic features corresponding to changes in glucose, lipids, phenylalanine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid and branched amino acids were observed, which point to oxidative stress and . To further confirm oxidative stress, targeted GC/MS-based metabonomics, performed in succession, allowed for a quantitative description of a total of 9 oxidative stress-related metabolites. Significant up-regulation of aspartic acid, phenylalanine and glutamic acid were observed in the HIV-infected cohorts as compared to controls. Tryptophan and  were down-regulated whereas cystine levels were increased in HIV-infected and untreated individuals as compared to both HIV treated and negative control subjects. Pathway analysis also revealed 11 metabolic pathways to be significantly altered by infection and/or treatment. These pathways included aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism and phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis. This pilot study demonstrated the use of multiplatform metabonomic strategies to elucidate metabolic markers that would be essential in predicting HIV/cART-induced oxidative stress.

The appearance of type 3 diabetes in the brain leads to the development of the sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease. The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), a subfamily of the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases, are enzymes composed by three different isoforms with differential modulatory activity against the  receptor (IR) and its substrate. This research focused on understanding the regulatory role of JNK2 on the IR, as well as study the effect of a high-fat diet (HFD) in the brain. Our observations determined how JNK2 ablation did not induce compensatory responses in the expression of the other isoforms but led to an increase in JNKs total activity. HFD-fed animals also showed an increased activity profile of the JNKs. These animals also displayed endoplasmic reticulum stress and up-regulation of the protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and the suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 protein. Consequently, a reduction in  sensitivity was detected and it is correlated with a decrease on the signalling of the IR. Moreover, cognitive impairment was observed in all groups but only wild-type genotype animals fed with HFD showed neuroinflammatory responses. In conclusion, HFD and JNK2 absence cause alterations in normal cognitive activity by altering the signalling of the IR. These affectations are related to the appearance of endoplasmic reticulum stress and an increase in the levels of inhibitory proteins like PTP1B and suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 protein.

The interaction of DNA damage and inflammation is affected by the -like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling pathway. The IGF1R pathway has been reported to regulate autophagy, as well, but sometimes through a bidirectional context. Targeting the IGF1R-autophagy crosstalk could represent a promising strategy for the development of new antiinflammatory and anticancer therapies, and may help for subjects suffering from MetS who are at increased risk of colorectal cancer. However, therapeutic responses to targeted therapies are often shortlived, since a signaling crosstalk of IGF1R with other receptor  kinases or autophagy exists, leading to acquired cellular  to therapy. From a pharmacological point of view, it is attractive to speculate that synergistic beneﬁts could be achieved by inhibition of one of the key effectors of the IGF1R pathway, in parallel with the pharmacological stimulation of the autophagy machinery, but cautiousness is also required, because pharmacologic IGF1R modulation can initiate additional, sometimes unfavorable biologic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30258609>Hepatic fatty acid biosynthesis in KK-A mice is modulated by administration of persimmon peel extract: A DNA microarray study.</a></h2><p>Previously, we showed that the intake of a persimmon peel (PP) extract altered hepatic gene expression associated with the  signaling pathway and enhanced  phosphorylation of  receptors in nonobese type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of fat-soluble PP extract on obese type 2 diabetic KK-A mice with .KK-A mice were fed a diet mixed with 0.1% of the extract for 8 weeks.

In nearly all metazoans, receptor  kinases (RTKs) are central players in these diverse and fundamental signaling processes. Aberrant RTK signaling is at the root of many developmental diseases and cancers and it remains a key focus of targeted therapies, several of which have achieved considerable success in patients. These therapeutic advances in targeting RTKs have been propelled by numerous genetic, biochemical, and structural studies detailing the functions and molecular mechanisms of regulation and activation of RTKs. The latter in particular have proven to be instrumental for the development of new drugs, selective targeting of mutant forms of RTKs found in disease, and counteracting ensuing drug . However, to this day, such studies have not yet yielded high-resolution structures of intact RTKs that encompass the extracellular and intracellular domains and the connecting membrane-spanning transmembrane domain. Technically challenging to obtain, these structures are instrumental to complete our understanding of the mechanisms by which RTKs are activated by extracellular ligands and of the effect of pathological mutations that do not directly reside in the catalytic sites of  kinase domains. In this review, we focus on the recent progress toward obtaining such structures and the insights already gained by structural studies of the subdomains of the receptors that belong to the epidermal growth factor receptor,  receptor, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor RTK families.© 2019 IUBMB Life, 71(6):706-720, 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31258478>Therapeutic Mechanisms of Herbal Medicines Against : A Review.</a></h2><p> is a condition in which  sensitivity is reduced and the  signaling pathway is impaired.

To decipher the signaling overlap behind this phenotypic resemblance, the activity status of RTKs is probed in post-mortem AD and T2D tissues and cell models.

Interestingly, irrespective of disease type, RTKs with enhanced and compromised activities clustered distinctly, indicating separate levels of regulations. Similar regulatory mechanisms within an activity cluster could be inferred, which have potential to impact future therapeutic developments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29859467>Qing Gan Zi Shen Tang alleviates adipose tissue dysfunction with up-regulation of SIRT1 in spontaneously hypertensive rat.</a></h2><p>Qing Gan Zi Shen Tang (QGZST) is a famous traditional Chinese medicine formula in the Jiangsu Province Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine for its efficacy in treating hypertension, obesity, hyperlipidemia and . The current study further evaluated the effects and possible mechanisms of QGZST on epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) dysfunction in a high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed-spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model. Results showed that QGZST significantly decreased the systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), body weights and adipocyte size of HFD-fed SHRs. Moreover, QGZST remarkably reduced the serum levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, fasting  and HOMA-IR index, increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and improved glucose intolerance in HFD-fed SHRs. Furthermore, QGZST dramatically attenuated HFD-fed-induced hypersecretion of proinflammatory cytokines and hypoproduction of adiponectin in SHRs. Mechanistically, QGZST stimulated the activity of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and suppress the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins-α(C/EBP-α), fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), acetylated nuclear factor-kappa-B-p65 (acetyl-NF-кB-p65) and protein- phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). More than that, QGZST also prevented acetyl-NF-кB-p65 nuclear accumulation. Collectively, our research demonstrated for the first time that QGZST is able to alleviate eWAT dysfunction with up-regulation of SIRT1 in HFD-fed SHRs, which might supply further insight into QGZST-mediated anti-hypertension and anti-obesity effects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the key genes and potential molecular mechanism in . Expression profiles of the genes were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were conducted at Enrichr. The protein⁻protein interaction (PPI) network was settled and analyzed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database constructed by Cytoscape software. Modules were extracted and identified by the PEWCC1 plugin. The microRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs) which control the expression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the NetworkAnalyst algorithm. A database (GSE73108) was downloaded from the GEO databases. Our results identified 873 DEGs (435 up-regulated and 438 down-regulated) genetically associated with . The pathways which were enriched were pathways in complement and coagulation cascades and complement activation for up-regulated DEGs, while biosynthesis of amino acids and the Notch signaling pathway were among the down-regulated DEGs. Showing GO enrichment were cardiac muscle cell⁻cardiac muscle cell adhesion and microvillus membrane for up-regulated DEGs and negative regulation of osteoblast differentiation and dendrites for down-regulated DEGs. Subsequently, myosin VB (MYO5B), discs, large homolog 2(DLG2), axin 2 (AXIN2), protein  kinase 7 (PTK7), Notch homolog 1 (NOTCH1), androgen receptor (AR), cyclin D1 (CCND1) and Rho family GTPase 3 (RND3) were diagnosed as the top hub genes in the up- and down-regulated PPI network and modules.

Nearly 30-50% of hypertensive patients have  (IR), with a strong correlation between hyperinsulinemia and microalbuminuria.The aim of this study was to demonstrate the existence of an imbalance between RAS and RDS associated to IR, hypertension and kidney damage induced by fructose overload (FO), as well as to establish their prevention, by pharmacological inhibition of RAS with losartan.Ninety-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups and studied at 4, 8 and 12 weeks: control group (C4, C8 and C12; tap water to drink); fructose-overloaded group (F4, F8 and F12; 10% w/v fructose solution to drink); losartan-treated control (L) group (L4, L8 and L12; losartan 30 mg/kg/day, in drinking water); and fructose-overloaded plus losartan group (F + L4, F + L8 and F + L12, in fructose solution).FO induced metabolic and hemodynamic alterations as well as an imbalance between RAS and RDS, characterized by increased renal angiotensin II levels and ATR overexpression, reduced urinary excretion of dopamine, increased excretion of l-dopa (increased l-dopa/dopamine index) and down-regulation of DR and tubular dopamine transporters OCT-2, OCT-N1 and total OCTNs. This imbalance was accompanied by an overexpression of renal tubular Na, K-ATPase, pro-inflammatory (NF-kB, TNF-α, IL-6) and pro-fibrotic (TGF-β1 and collagen) markers and by renal damage (microalbuminuria and reduced nephrin expression). Losartan prevented the metabolic and hemodynamic alterations induced by FO from week 4. Increased urinary l-dopa/dopamine index and decreased DR renal expression associated to FO were also prevented by losartan since week 4. The same pattern was observed for renal expression of OCTs/OCTNs, Na, K-ATPase, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic markers from week 8. The appearance of microalbuminuria and reduced nephrin expression was prevented by losartan at week 12.The results of this study provide new insight regarding the mechanisms by which a pro-hypertensive and pro-inflammatory system, such as RAS, downregulates another anti-hypertensive and anti-inflammatory system such as RDS. Additionally, we propose the use of l-dopa/dopamine index as a biochemical marker of renal dysfunction in conditions characterized by sodium retention, IR and/or hypertension, and as a predictor of response to treatment and follow-up of these processes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

As a unique member of the HER family, HER3 lacks or has little intrinsic  kinase activity. It frequently co-expresses and forms heterodimers with other receptor  kinases (RTKs) in cancer cells to activate oncogenic signaling, especially the PI-3K/Akt pathway and Src kinase. Elevated expression of HER3 has been observed in a wide variety of human cancers and associates with a worse survival in cancer patients with solid tumors. Studies on the underlying mechanism implicate HER3 expression as a major cause of treatment failure in cancer therapy. Activation of HER3 signaling has also been shown to promote cancer metastasis. These data strongly support the notion that therapeutic inactivation of HER3 and/or its downstream signaling is required to overcome treatment  and improve the outcomes of cancer patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29411486>Severe  in disguise: A familial case of reactive hypoglycemia associated with a novel heterozygous INSR mutation.</a></h2><p>Hypoglycemia in childhood is very rare and can be caused by genetic mutations or -secreting neoplasms.

Pancreatic imaging showed no evidence of neoplasia. Acanthosis nigricans with high fasting  levels in the proband suggested severe  and prompted INSR gene sequencing, which revealed the novel, heterozygous p.Phe1213Leu mutation in the patient and his family members.

Defects at the level of mitochondria are also characteristic of heart failure. We assessed changes in cardiac  response and mitochondrial function in a model of pressure overload-induced heart failure.Rats underwent aortic banding to induce pressure overload. At 10 weeks, rats showed cardiac hypertrophy and pulmonary congestion, but left ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction were only evident after 20 weeks. This contractile impairment was accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction as shown by markedly reduced state 3 respiration of isolated mitochondria. Aortic banding did not affect systemic  response. However, -stimulated cardiac glucose uptake and glucose oxidation were significantly diminished at 10 and 20 weeks, which indicates cardiac  starting before the onset of mitochondrial and contractile dysfunction. The impaired cardiac  action was related to a decrease in -stimulated phosphorylation of  receptor β. Consistently, we found elevated activity of protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) at 10 and 20 weeks, which may blunt  action by dephosphorylating  receptor β. PTP1B activity was also significantly increased in left ventricular samples of patients with systolic dysfunction undergoing aortic valve replacement because of aortic stenosis.Pressure overload causes cardiac  that precedes and accompanies mitochondrial and systolic dysfunction.

Cocoa has anti-diabetic effects by lowering glucose levels. However, whether cocoa exerts beneficial effects on the renal cortex glucose homeostasis and the molecular mechanisms responsible for this possible protective activity remain largely unknown. Thus, the potential anti-diabetic properties of cocoa on  signalling, glucose transporters and gluconeogenic enzymes were evaluated in the renal cortex of Zucker Diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Male ZDF rats were fed a control or cocoa-rich diet (10%), and Zucker Lean animals received the control diet. ZDF rats supplemented with cocoa (ZDF-Co) showed decreased body weight gain, glucose and  levels, improved glucose tolerance,  and structural alterations in renal cortex. Moreover, cocoa-rich diet ameliorated  by reverting decreased -phosphorylated- receptor levels and by preventing the inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3/glycogen synthase pathway (GSK-3/GS) in the renal cortex of ZDF-Co rats. Cocoa antihyperglycaemic effect also appeared to be mediated through the diminution of phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase), sodium-glucose-co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2), and glucose-transporter-2 (GLUT-2) levels in ZDF-Co rat's renal cortex. These findings demonstrate that cocoa alleviates renal injury by contributing to maintain the glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetic ZDF rats.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

DM is characterized by the elevation of blood glucose due either to a defect in  synthesis, secretion, binding to receptor, or an increase of . The internal and external factors such as obesity, urbanizations, and genetic mutations could increase the risk of developing DM. Flavonoids are phenolic compounds existing as secondary metabolites in fruits and vegetables as well as fungi. Their structure consists of 15 carbon skeletons and two aromatic rings (A and B) connected by three carbon chains. Flavonoids are furtherly classified into 6 subclasses: flavonols, flavones, flavanones, isoflavones, flavanols, and anthocyanidins. Naturally occurring flavonoids possess anti-diabetic effects. As in vitro and animal model's studies demonstrate, they have the ability to prevent diabetes and its complications. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge addressing the antidiabetic effects of dietary flavonoids and their underlying molecular mechanisms on selected pathways: Glucose transporter, hepatic enzymes,  kinase inhibitor, AMPK, PPAR, and NF-κB. Flavonoids improve the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications through the regulation of glucose metabolism, hepatic enzymes activities, and a lipid profile. Most studies illustrate a positive role of specific dietary flavonoids on diabetes, but the mechanisms of action and the side effects need more clarification. Overall, more research is needed to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of diabetes treatment using flavonoids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660449>Dietary Exposure to Transgenic Rice Expressing the Spider Silk Protein Fibroin Reduces Blood Glucose Levels in Diabetic Mice: The Potential Role of  Receptor Substrate-1 Phosphorylation in Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by  (IR). T2DM is correlated with obesity and most T2DM medications have been developed for enhancing  sensitivity. Silk protein fibroin (SPF) from spiders has been suggested as an attractive biomaterial for medical purposes. We generated transgenic rice (TR) expressing SPF and fed it to diabetic BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr mice to monitor the changes in blood glucose levels and adipose tissue proteins associated with energy metabolism and  signaling. In the present study, the adipocyte size in abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice was remarkably smaller than that of the control. Whereas the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated protein kinase and  receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein levels were increased in abdominal adipose tissues after TR-SPF feeding, levels of six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) proteins decreased. Phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 and IRS1 at serine 307 and  632 were both increased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice. Increased expression and phosphorylation of IRS1 at both serine 307 and  632 in adipose tissues indicated that adipocytes obtained from abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice were more susceptible to  signaling than that of the control. STAMP2 protein levels decreased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice, indicating that STAMP2 proteins were reducing adipocytes that were undergoing lipolysis. Taken together, this study showed that TR-SPF was effective in reducing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and that concurrent lipolysis in abdominal adipocytes was associated with alterations of AMPK, IRS1, and STAMP2. Increased IRS1 expression and its phosphorylation by TR-SFP were considered to be particularly important in the induction of lipolysis in adipocytes, as well as in reducing blood glucose levels in this animal model.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29435137>Activation of MAPK signalling results in  to saracatinib (AZD0530) in ovarian cancer.</a></h2><p>SRC  kinase is frequently overexpressed and activated in late-stage, poor prognosis ovarian tumours, and preclinical studies have supported the use of targeted SRC inhibitors in the treatment of this disease. The SAPPROC trial investigated the addition of the SRC inhibitor saracatinib (AZD0530) to weekly paclitaxel for the treatment of platinum resistant ovarian cancer; however, this drug combination did not provide any benefit to progression free survival (PFS) of women with platinum resistant disease. In this study we aimed to identify mechanisms of  to SRC inhibitors in ovarian cancer cells. Using two complementary strategies; a targeted tumour suppressor gene siRNA screen, and a phospho-receptor  kinase array, we demonstrate that activation of MAPK signalling, via a reduction in NF1 (neurofibromin) expression or overexpression of HER2 and the  receptor, can drive  to AZD0530. Knockdown of NF1 in two ovarian cancer cell lines resulted in  to AZD0530, and was accompanied with activated MEK and ERK signalling. We also show that silencing of HER2 and the  receptor can partially resensitize AZD0530 resistant cells, which was associated with decreased phosphorylation of MEK and ERK. Furthermore, we demonstrate a synergistic effect of combining SRC and MEK inhibitors in both AZD0530 sensitive and resistant cells, and that MEK inhibition is sufficient to completely resensitize AZD0530 resistant cells. This work provides a preclinical rationale for the combination of SRC and MEK inhibitors in the treatment of ovarian cancer, and also highlights the need for biomarker driven patient selection for clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29450546>A Plasma Metabolomic Signature of the Exfoliation Syndrome Involves Amino Acids, Acylcarnitines, and Polyamines.</a></h2><p>To determine the plasma metabolomic signature of the exfoliative syndrome (XFS), the most common cause worldwide of secondary open-angle glaucoma.We performed a targeted metabolomic study, using the standardized p180 Biocrates Absolute IDQ p180 kit with a QTRAP 5500 mass spectrometer, to compare the metabolomic profiles of plasma from individuals with XFS (n = 16), and an age- and sex-matched control group with cataract (n = 18).A total of 151 metabolites were detected correctly, 16 of which allowed for construction of an OPLS-DA model with a good predictive capability (Q2cum = 0.51) associated with a low risk of over-fitting (permQ2 = -0.48, CV-ANOVA P-value <0.001). The metabolites contributing the most to the signature were octanoyl-carnitine (C8) and decanoyl-carnitine (C10), the branched-chain amino acids (i.e., isoleucine, leucine, and valine), and , all of which were at higher concentrations in the XFS group, whereas spermine and spermidine, together with their precursor acetyl-ornithine, were at lower concentrations than in the control group.We identified a significant metabolomic signature in the plasma of individuals with XFS.

Therefore, we examined whether florbetapir, a radiopharmaceutical agent used for detection of amyloid-β deposits in the brain, also allows identification of islet amyloid in the pancreas.Saturation binding assays were used to determine the affinity of florbetapir for human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) aggregates in vitro. Islet amyloid-prone transgenic mice that express hIAPP in their beta cells and amyloid-free non-transgenic control mice were used to examine the ability of florbetapir to detect islet amyloid deposits in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo. Mice or mouse pancreases were subjected to autoradiographic, histochemical and/or positron emission tomography (PET) analyses to assess the utility of florbetapir in identifying islet amyloid.In vitro, florbetapir bound synthetic hIAPP fibrils with a dissociation constant of 7.9 nmol/l. Additionally, florbetapir bound preferentially to amyloid-containing hIAPP transgenic vs amyloid-free non-transgenic mouse pancreas sections in vitro, as determined by autoradiography (16,475 ± 5581 vs 5762 ± 575 density/unit area, p < 0.05). In hIAPP transgenic and non-transgenic mice fed a high-fat diet for 1 year, intravenous administration of florbetapir followed by PET scanning showed that the florbetapir signal was significantly higher in amyloid-laden hIAPP transgenic vs amyloid-free non-transgenic pancreases in vivo during the first 5 min of the scan (36.83 ± 2.22 vs 29.34 ± 2.03 standardised uptake value × min, p < 0.05). Following PET, pancreases were excised and florbetapir uptake was determined ex vivo by γ counting. Pancreatic uptake of florbetapir was significantly correlated with the degree of islet amyloid deposition, the latter assessed by histochemistry (r = 0.74, p < 0.001).Florbetapir binds to islet amyloid deposits in a specific and quantitative manner.

Although RTT has been associated with obesity, the underlying mechanism has not yet been elucidated. In this study, female heterozygous Mecp2-null mice (Mecp2+/- mice), a model of RTT, were fed a normal chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD), and the changes in molecular signaling pathways were investigated. Specifically, we examined the expression of genes related to the hypothalamus and dopamine reward circuitry, which represent a central network of feeding behavior control. In particular, dopamine reward circuitry has been shown to regulate hedonic feeding behavior, and its disruption is associated with HFD-related changes in palatability. The Mecp2+/- mice that were fed the normal chow showed normal body weight and food consumption, whereas those fed the HFD showed extreme obesity with hyperphagia, an increase of body fat mass, glucose intolerance, and  compared with wild-type mice fed the HFD (WT-HFD mice). The main cause of obesity in Mecp2+/--HFD mice was a remarkable increase in calorie intake, with no difference in oxygen consumption or locomotor activity. Agouti-related peptide mRNA and protein levels were increased, whereas proopiomelanocortin mRNA and protein levels were reduced in Mecp2+/--HFD mice with hyperleptinemia, which play an essential role in appetite and satiety in the hypothalamus. The conditioned place preference test revealed that Mecp2+/- mice preferred the HFD.  hydroxylase and dopamine transporter mRNA levels in the ventral tegmental area, and dopamine receptor and dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein mRNA levels in the nucleus accumbens were significantly lower in Mecp2+/--HFD mice than those of WT-HFD mice. Thus, HFD feeding induced dysregulation of food intake in the hypothalamus and dopamine reward circuitry, and accelerated the development of extreme obesity associated with addiction-like eating behavior in Mecp2+/- mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284101>Identification of chebulinic acid as a dual targeting inhibitor of protein  phosphatases relevant to .</a></h2><p>Natural products as antidiabetic agents have been shown to stimulate  signaling via the inhibition of the protein  phosphatases relevant to . Previously, we have identified PTPN9 and DUSP9 as potential antidiabetic targets and a multi-targeting natural product thereof. In this study, knockdown of PTPN11 increased AMPK phosphorylation in differentiated C2C12 muscle cells by 3.8 fold, indicating that PTPN11 could be an antidiabetic target. Screening of a library of 658 natural products against PTPN9, DUSP9, or PTPN11 identified chebulinic acid (CA) as a strong allosteric inhibitor with a slow cooperative binding to PTPN9 (IC = 34 nM) and PTPN11 (IC = 37 nM), suggesting that it would be a potential antidiabetic candidate. Furthermore, CA stimulated glucose uptake and resulted in increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. Taken together, we demonstrated that CA increased glucose uptake as a dual inhibitor of PTPN9 and PTPN11 through activation of the AMPK signaling pathway. These results strongly suggest that CA could be used as a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study we examined whether inhibition of EGFR activation would affect the development of DN in a mouse model of accelerated type 2 diabetes (BKS  with endothelial nitric oxide knockout [eNOS]). eNOS mice received vehicle or erlotinib, an inhibitor of EGFR  kinase activity, beginning at 8 weeks of age and were sacrificed at 20 weeks of age. In addition, genetic models inhibiting EGFR activity () and transforming growth factor-α () were studied in this model of DN in type 2 diabetes. Compared with vehicle-treated mice, erlotinib-treated animals had less albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis, less podocyte loss, and smaller amounts of renal profibrotic and fibrotic components. Erlotinib treatment decreased renal oxidative stress, macrophage and T-lymphocyte infiltration, and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Erlotinib treatment also preserved pancreas function, and these mice had higher blood  levels at 20 weeks, decreased basal blood glucose levels, increased glucose tolerance and  sensitivity, and increased blood levels of adiponectin compared with vehicle-treated mice. Similar to the aforementioned results, both  and  diabetic mice also had attenuated DN, preserved pancreas function, and decreased basal blood glucose levels.

However, the metabolomic signature of T2DM in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has not been investigated thus far. In this prospective metabolomic study, fasting CSF and plasma samples from 40 T2DM patients to 36 control subjects undergoing elective surgery with spinal anesthesia were analyzed by H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. NMR spectra of CSF and plasma metabolites were analyzed and correlated with the presence of T2DM and diabetic microangiopathy (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) using an area under the curve (AUC) estimation. CSF metabolomic profiles in T2DM patients vs. controls revealed significantly increased levels of alanine, leucine, valine, , lactate, pyruvate, and decreased levels of histidine. In addition, a combination of alanine, histidine, leucine, pyruvate, , and valine in CSF showed a superior correlation with the presence of T2DM (AUC:0.951), diabetic retinopathy (AUC:0.858), nephropathy (AUC:0.811), and neuropathy (AUC:0.691). Similar correlations also appeared in plasma profiling. These metabolic alterations in CSF suggest decreasing aerobic metabolism and increasing anaerobic glycolysis in cerebral circulation of patients with T2DM. In conclusion, our results provide clues for the metabolic derangements in diabetic central neuropathy among T2DM patients; however, their clinical significance requires further exploration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29270816>Arctic berry extracts target the gut-liver axis to alleviate metabolic endotoxaemia,  and hepatic steatosis in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>There is growing evidence that fruit polyphenols exert beneficial effects on the metabolic syndrome, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, we aimed to analyse the effects of polyphenolic extracts from five types of Arctic berries in a model of diet-induced obesity.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS) diet and orally treated with extracts of bog blueberry (BBE), cloudberry (CLE), crowberry (CRE), alpine bearberry (ABE), lingonberry (LGE) or vehicle (HFHS) for 8 weeks. An additional group of standard-chow-fed, vehicle-treated mice was included as a reference control for diet-induced obesity. OGTTs and  tolerance tests were conducted, and both plasma  and C-peptide were assessed throughout the OGTT. Quantitative PCR, western blot analysis and ELISAs were used to assess enterohepatic immunometabolic features. Faecal DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA gene-based analysis was used to profile the gut microbiota.Treatment with CLE, ABE and LGE, but not with BBE or CRE, prevented both fasting hyperinsulinaemia (mean ± SEM [pmol/l]: chow 67.2 ± 12.3, HFHS 153.9 ± 19.3, BBE 114.4 ± 14.3, CLE 82.5 ± 13.0, CRE 152.3 ± 24.4, ABE 90.6 ± 18.0, LGE 95.4 ± 10.5) and postprandial hyperinsulinaemia (mean ± SEM AUC [pmol/l × min]: chow 14.3 ± 1.4, HFHS 31.4 ± 3.1, BBE 27.2 ± 4.0, CLE 17.7 ± 2.2, CRE 32.6 ± 6.3, ABE 22.7 ± 18.0, LGE 23.9 ± 2.5). None of the berry extracts affected C-peptide levels or body weight gain. Levels of hepatic serine phosphorylated Akt were 1.6-, 1.5- and 1.2-fold higher with CLE, ABE and LGE treatment, respectively, and hepatic carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM)-1  phosphorylation was 0.6-, 0.7- and 0.9-fold increased in these mice vs vehicle-treated, HFHS-fed mice. These changes were associated with reduced liver triacylglycerol deposition, lower circulating endotoxins, alleviated hepatic and intestinal inflammation, and major gut microbial alterations (e.g. bloom of Akkermansia muciniphila, Turicibacter and Oscillibacter) in CLE-, ABE- and LGE-treated mice.Our findings reveal novel mechanisms by which polyphenolic extracts from ABE, LGE and especially CLE target the gut-liver axis to protect diet-induced obese mice against metabolic endotoxaemia,  and hepatic steatosis, which importantly improves hepatic  clearance. These results support the potential benefits of these Arctic berries and their integration into health programmes to help attenuate obesity-related chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders.All raw sequences have been deposited in the public European Nucleotide Archive server under accession number PRJEB19783 ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB19783 ).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30333869>Hepatocyte growth factor-induced mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor activation leads to -like growth factor 1 receptor inhibitor unresponsiveness in gastric cancer cells.</a></h2><p>-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) inhibitors have been developed as potential therapeutics for cancer treatment; however, the phase III trials have not produced promising overall survival rates. Therefore, understanding the mechanism underlying intrinsic  to IGF-1R-targeted agents is urgently required. A number of studies have revealed that activation of alternative receptor  kinases can mediate  to IGF-1R-targeted therapy. The present study investigated whether activated mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET; also known as c-Met and hepatocyte growth factor receptor) confers  to an IGF-1R inhibitor (NVP-AEW541) of gastric cancer (GC) cells. NCI-N87 and MGC-803 cells were treated with varying concentrations and combinations of NVP-AEW541, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and MET small interfering (si)-RNA or crizotinib (a MET inhibitor). The effects of these agents on cell proliferation and pro-apoptotic events were assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 assays and flow cytometry. Receptor activation and the downstream signaling pathway were examined using western blot analysis. Expression and/or activation of MET and IGF-1R in 156 GC specimens were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The results demonstrated that NVP-AEW541 inhibited cell growth, with dephosphorylation of IGF-1R and protein kinase B (AKT), in NCI-N87 and MGC-803 cells. Application of HGF activated MET and the downstream AKT signaling pathways, decreased apoptotic events and restored cell proliferation, which were reversed by MET inhibition via crizotinib or siRNA knockdown. Furthermore, combination therapy of NVP-AEW541 and crizotinib exhibited an enhanced effectiveness . In addition, >40% of IGF-1R overexpressed GC specimens showed MET expression and activation. In conclusion, HGF-induced MET activation may represent a novel mechanism conferring unresponsiveness to IGF-1R-targeted agents in GC, and inhibition of MET may improve the efficacy of IGF-1R inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30793357>Stress-related hormones affect carbohydrate metabolism in Drosophila females.</a></h2><p>A highly conservative  signaling pathway, stable work of which is indicated by carbohydrates metabolism, is also known to play an important role in the control of stress .

We have shown that the rise in juvenile hormone (JH) and dopamine decreases levels of both carbohydrates under the normal conditions but brings them to values close to normal following the stress exposure. The data obtained suggest that (a) dopamine and JH involved in the neuroendocrine stress reaction in D. melanogaster also take part in the regulation of carbohydrates metabolism, tending to normalize it after stress; (b) the regulation of trehalose content under stress does not occur at the level of transcription of the degrading enzyme.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30052036>Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Derived Exosomes Alleviate Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus by Reversing Peripheral  and Relieving β-Cell Destruction.</a></h2><p>Exosomes are nanosized extracellular vesicles (EVs) that show great promise in tissue regeneration and injury repair as mesenchymal stem cell (MSC). MSC has been shown to alleviate diabetes mellitus (DM) in both animal models and clinical trials. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether exosomes from human umbilical cord MSC (hucMSC-ex) have a therapeutic effect on type 2 DM (T2DM). We established a rat model of T2DM using a high-fat diet and streptozotocin (STZ). We found that the intravenous injection of hucMSC-ex reduced blood glucose levels as a main paracrine approach of MSC. HucMSC-ex partially reversed  in T2DM indirectly to accelerate glucose metabolism. HucMSC-ex restored the phosphorylation ( site) of the  receptor substrate 1 and protein kinase B in T2DM, promoted expression and membrane translocation of glucose transporter 4 in muscle, and increased storage of glycogen in the liver to maintain glucose homeostasis. HucMSC-ex inhibited STZ-induced β-cell apoptosis to restore the -secreting function of T2DM.

In this study, we explored the molecular mechanism of IR with chronic renal failure (CRF) and interventions to alleviate IR in patients with CRF. MATERIAL AND METHODS In vivo and in vitro models of CRF were established by 5/6 nephrectomy and urea stimulation C2C12 cells, respectively. Based on the CRF model, angiotensin II (Ang II) and valsartan groups were established to observe the effect of drug intervention on IR. Western blot assays were performed to detect the expression and phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt, which are 2 critical proteins in the  signaling pathway. RESULTS Both urea stimulation and 5/6 nephrectomy induced glucose uptake disorder in skeletal muscle cells (P<0.01). Skeletal muscle IR was aggravated in the Ang II group (P<0.05) but alleviated in the valsartan group (P<0.01). Regardless of the experimental method (in vivo or in vitro),  phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt were significantly lower (P<0.01) and serine phosphorylation was significantly higher (P<0.01) in the model group than in the sham/control group. Compared to the model group, additional Ang II aggravated abnormal phosphorylation (P<0.05); conversely, additional valsartan alleviated abnormal phosphorylation to some extent (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS There is skeletal muscle  in the presence of CRF. This phenomenon can be aggravated by Ang II and partially relieved by valsartan. One of the mechanisms of IR in CRF patients may be associated with the critical proteins in the IRS-PI3k-Akt pathway by changing their phosphorylation levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29391561>Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is identified as a potential biomarker of  in skeletal muscle.</a></h2><p>To unravel metabolic determinats of , we performed a targeted metabolomics analysis in Korean Children-Adolescent Cohort Study (KoCAS, n = 430).

Functional interactions of metabolites with gene/proteins using biological pathway with  were not identified biological significance and regulatory effects of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). However, ADMA showed a higher association with adolescent obesity (P < 0.001) and adult diabetes (P = 0.007) and decreased after obesity intervention program. Functional studies in cellular and mouse models demonstrated that an accumulation of ADMA is associated with the regulation of obesity-induced  in skeletal muscle. ADMA treatment inhibited dimethylarginine-dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) activity and mRNA expression in  muscle cell. Moreover, the treatment led to decrease of phosphorylation of  receptor (IR), AKT, and GLUT4 but increase of protein- phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). Accordingly, increased ADMA significantly inhibited glucose uptake in myotube cell. We suggest that accumulation of ADMA is associated with modulation of  signaling and . ADMA might expand the possibilities of new therapeutic target for functional and clinical implications in the control of energy and metabolic homeostasis in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31319588>The Role of Protein  Phosphatase (PTP)-1B in Cardiovascular Disease and Its Interplay with .</a></h2><p>Endothelial dysfunction is a key feature of cardiovascular disorders associated with obesity and diabetes. Several studies identified protein  phosphatase (PTP)-1B, a member of the PTP superfamily, as a major negative regulator for  receptor signaling and a novel molecular player in endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. Unlike other anti-diabetic approaches, genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of PTP1B was found to improve glucose homeostasis and  signaling without causing lipid buildup in the liver, which represents an advantage over existing therapies. Furthermore, PTP1B was reported to contribute to cardiovascular disturbances, at various molecular levels, which places this enzyme as a unique single therapeutic target for both diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. Synthesizing selective small molecule inhibitors for PTP1B is faced with multiple challenges linked to its similarity of sequence with other PTPs; however, overcoming these challenges would pave the way for novel approaches to treat diabetes and its concurrent cardiovascular complications. In this review article, we summarized the major roles of PTP1B in cardiovascular disease with special emphasis on endothelial dysfunction and its interplay with .

Dysregulation of  signaling is linked to diabetes and cancer. The spindle checkpoint controls the fidelity of chromosome segregation during mitosis. Here, we show that  receptor substrate 1 and 2 (IRS1/2) cooperate with spindle checkpoint proteins to promote  receptor (IR) endocytosis through recruiting the clathrin adaptor complex AP2 to IR. A phosphorylation switch of IRS1/2 orchestrated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and Src homology phosphatase 2 (SHP2) ensures selective internalization of activated IR. SHP2 inhibition blocks this feedback regulation and growth-promoting IR signaling, prolongs  action on metabolism, and improves  sensitivity in mice. We propose that mitotic regulators and SHP2 promote feedback inhibition of IR, thereby limiting the duration of  signaling.

Clinopodium chinense (Benth.) O. Kuntze has been shown to lower blood glucose and attenuate high glucose-induced vascular endothelial cells injury. In the present study we investigated the effects of ethyl acetate extract of C. chinense (CCE) on PA-induced inflammation and IR in the vascular endothelium and its molecular mechanism. We found that CCE significantly inhibited PA-induced toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Consequently, this led to the inhibition of the following downstream adapted proteins myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88, Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-  and TNF receptor-associated factor 6. Moreover, CCE inhibited the phosphorylation of Ikappa B kinase  , nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-  B), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular regulated protein kinases, p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and subsequently suppressed the release of tumor necrosis factor-  , interleukin-1  (IL-1  ) and IL-6. CCE also inhibited IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and ameliorated -mediated  phosphorylation of IRS-1. Moreover, CCE restored serine/threonine kinase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and thus increased -mediated nitric oxide (NO) production in PA-treated HUVECs.

These results suggest that CCE can significantly inhibit the inflammatory response and alleviate impaired  signaling in the vascular endothelium by suppressing TLR4-mediated NF-  B and MAPK pathways.

The -IR complex is rapidly internalized and then is either recycled back to the plasma membrane or sent to lysosomes for degradation. Although most of the receptor is recycled or degraded, a small amount may escape this pathway and migrate to the nucleus of the cell where it might be important in promulgation of receptor signals. In this study we explored the mechanism by which  induces IR translocation to the cell nucleus. Experiments were performed cultured L6 myoblasts, AML liver cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes.  treatment induced a rapid increase in nuclear IR protein levels within 2 to 5 min. Treatment with WGA, an inhibitor of nuclear import, reduced -induced increases nuclear IR protein; IR was, however, translocated to a perinuclear location. Bioinformatics tools predicted a potential nuclear localization sequence (NLS) on IR. Immunofluorescence staining showed that a point mutation on the predicted NLS blocked -induced IR nuclear translocation. In addition, blockade of nuclear IR activation in isolated nuclei by an IR blocking antibody abrogated -induced increases in IR  phosphorylation and nuclear PKCδ levels. Furthermore, over expression of mutated IR reduced -induced glucose uptake and PKB phosphorylation. When added to isolated nuclei,  induced IR phosphorylation but had no effect on nuclear IR protein levels.

Recently, it has been shown that treatments to improve  in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) may be useful for PD patients. In previous studies, the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist liraglutide showed good neuroprotective effects in animal models of PD. In addition, the GLP-1 mimetic exendin-4 has shown good protective effects in PD patients in a phase II clinical trial. Here, we report the protective effects of semaglutide (25 nmol/kg ip. once-daily for 7 days), a new long-acting GLP-1 analogue, in the MPTP mouse model of PD. Moreover, we compared the neuroprotective effect of semaglutide with liraglutide given at the same dose. Our work shows that both semaglutide and liraglutide improved 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced motor impairments. In addition, both GLP-1 analogues rescued the decrease of  hydroxylase (TH) levels, alleviated the inflammation response, reduced lipid peroxidation, inhibited the apoptosis pathway, and also increased autophagy- related protein expression, to protect dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum. Moreover, the long-acting GLP-1 analogue semaglutide was superior to liraglutide in most parameters measured in this study. Our results demonstrate that the new long- acting GLP-1 analogue semaglutide may be a promising treatment for PD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we showed that the elevation of TESC in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) intensifies epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC) properties, consequently enhancing the cellular  to γ-radiation. TESC expression and the phosphorylation (consequent activation) of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were upregulated in CSC-like ALDH1 cells than in ALDH1 cells sorted from A549 NSCLC cells. Knockdown of TESC suppressed CSC-like properties as well as STAT3 activation through inhibition of -like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), a major signaling pathway of lung cancer stem cells. TESC activated IGF1R by the direct recruitment of proto-oncogene  kinase c-Src (c-Src) to IGF1Rβ complex. Treatment of IGF1R inhibitor, AG1024, also suppressed c-Src activation, implicating that TESC mediates the mutual activation of c-Src and IGF1R. STAT3 activation by TESC/c-Src/IGF1R signaling pathway subsequently upregulated ALDH1 expression, which enhanced EMT-associated CSC-like properties. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assay demonstrated that STAT3 is a potential transcription activator of ALDH1 isozymes. Ultimately, targeting TESC can be a potential strategy to overcome therapeutic  in NSCLC caused by augmented EMT and self-renewal capacity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30638738>Essential amino acid-enriched meal replacement promotes superior net protein balance in older, overweight adults.</a></h2><p>Older individuals are susceptible to the loss of muscle and accumulation of fat. To address this problem, we have compared protein kinetics following consumption of an essential amino acid (EAA)-enriched meal replacement (EMR) to consumption of a high-protein meal replacement beverage (Bariatric Advantage, BA) using stable isotope methodology.Eight older (67 ± 2), obese (35 ± 2 kg/m) female and male participants completed two studies using a randomized, crossover design in which they ingested each meal replacement. The isotopic tracers L-[H]phenylalanine & L-[H] were delivered via primed, continuous intravenous infusion throughout a basal period and following consumption of EMR or BA. We determined changes in whole body protein synthesis (PS), protein breakdown (PB), and net protein balance (NB) from fasted states via analysis of plasma samples by LC-ESI-MS.PS was higher (P = 0.03) and PB was less (P = 0.005) with EMR in comparison to BA. As a result, NB was much greater (P = 0.00003) following the ingestion of EMR as compared to BA.In comparison with BA, which has a higher amount of intact protein that any other meal replacement, EMR promoted a greater increment in NB. These data support the potential efficacy of EMR as a meal replacement for the preservation of lean tissue mass during weight loss in older, overweight individuals.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Therefore, the relationship between survival and IGF1R expression was assessed for oral cavity (OC) cancer, and the antitumor effects of two IGF1R-TKIs, OSI-906 and BMS-754807, were evaluated in HNSCC cell lines in vitro.Clinical outcome data and tissue microarray immunohistochemistry were used to generate IGF1R expression-specific survival curves. Immunoblot, alamarBlue proliferation assay, trypan blue exclusion viability test, clonogenic assay, flow cytometry, and reverse phase protein array (RPPA) were used to evaluate in vitro responses to IGF1R-TKIs.For patients with stage III/IV OCSCC, higher IGF1R expression was associated with poorer overall 5-year survival (P = 0.029). Both BMS-754807 and OSI-906 caused dose-dependent inhibition of IGF1R and Akt phosphorylation and inhibited proliferation; BMS-754807 was more potent than OSI-906. Both drugs reduced HNSCC cell viability; only OSI-906 was able to eliminate all viable cells at 10 μM. The two drugs similarly inhibited clonogenic cell survival. At 1 μM, only BMS-754807 caused a fourfold increase in the basal apoptotic rate. RPPA demonstrated broad effects of both drugs on canonical IGF1R signaling pathways and also inhibition of human epidermal growth factor receptor-3 (HER3), Src, paxillin, and ezrin phosphorylation.OSI-906 and BMS-754807 inhibit IGF1R activity in HNSCC cell lines with reduction in prosurvival and proliferative signaling and with concomitant antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects.

Dietary fat and protein were both correlated with changes in valine, leucine/isoleucine/norleucine, phenylalanine, and , but energy intake was not. The change in fat mass and weight was related to the change in several amino acids.

Recent studies suggested that protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) could ameliorate metabolic disorders and suppress inflammatory responses. This study investigated PTPN2's role in modulating DN and the possible cellular mechanisms involved. In a mouse model combining hyperglycaemia and hypercholesterolaemia (streptozotocin diabetic, ApoE mice), mice showed severe , renal dysfunction, micro-inflammation, subsequent extracellular matrix expansion and decreased expression of PTPN2. We found that mice treated with PTPN2 displayed reduced serum creatinine, serum BUN and proteinuria. PTPN2 gene therapy markedly attenuated metabolic disorders and hyperglycaemia. In addition, PTPN2 gene transfer significantly suppressed renal activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), STAT-dependent pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes expression, and influx of lymphocytes in DN, indicating anti-inflammatory effects of PTPN2 by inhibiting the activation of STAT signalling pathway in vivo. Furthermore, PTPN2 overexpression inhibited the high-glucose induced phosphorylation of STAT, target genes expression and proliferation in mouse mesangial and tubuloepithelial cells, suggesting that the roles of PTPN2 on STAT activation was independent of glycaemic changes. Our results demonstrated that PTPN2 gene therapy could exert protective effects on DN via ameliorating metabolic disorders and inhibiting renal STAT-dependent micro-inflammation, suggesting its potential role for treatment of human DN.© 2019 The Authors.

However, a limiting factor to the use of endocrine therapy in bca is  resulting from the development of escape pathways that promote the survival of cancer cells despite estrogen receptor (er)-targeted therapy. The  pathways involve extensive cross-talk between er and receptor  kinase growth factors [epidermal growth factor receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2), and -like growth factor 1 receptor] and their downstream signalling pathways-most notably pi3k/akt/mtor and mapk. In some cases,  develops as a result of genetic or epigenetic alterations in various components of the signalling pathways, such as overexpression of her2 and erα co-activators, aberrant expression of cell-cycle regulators, and  mutations. By combining endocrine therapy with various molecularly targeted agents and signal transduction inhibitors, some success has been achieved in overcoming and modulating endocrine  in hr-positive bca. Established strategies include selective er downregulators, anti-her2 agents, mtor (mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibitors, and inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6. Inhibitors of pi3ka are not currently a treatment option for women with hr-positive bca outside the context of clinical trial.

Indeed, it is unknown whether the mechanism of IR in PCOS is mediated through changes in the metabolome.  Twelve women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and ten age and body mass index matched controls completed an 8 week supervised exercise program at 60% maximal oxygen consumption. Before and after the exercise program, all participants underwent maximal IR stimulation with intralipid infusions followed by  sensitivity (IS) measurement by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamps. Amino acid profiles and metabolites were taken at baseline and at maximal  stimulation before and after the exercise program.  At baseline, PCOS subjects showed increased leucine/isoleucine, glutamate, methionine, ornithine, phenylalanine,  and proline ( < 0.05) that, following exercise, did not differ from controls. While compering within the groups, no significant changes in the amino acid levels before and after exercise were observed. Exercise improved VO2 max ( < 0.01) but did not alter weight. Amino acid profiles were unaffected by an acute increase in IR induced by the lipid infusion. IS was lower in PCOS ( < 0.001) and was further decreased by the lipid infusion in both PCOS and controls. Although, exercise improved IS in both PCOS and in controls, the IS remained compromised in PCOS.  The baseline amino acid profile in PCOS reflected that seen in obese subjects and differed to controls. After exercise, and despite no change in weight in either group, there were no differences in the amino acid profile between PCOS and controls.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the enhanced antitumor effect of metformin (Met), a biguanide drug, in combination with gefitinib (Gef) in primary resistant human lung cancer cells and the associated molecular mechanism.H1975 cell line was treated with Met and/or Gef to examine the inhibition of cell growth and potential mechanism of action by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), Ki67 incorporation assay, flow cytometry analysis, small interfering RNA technology, Western blot analysis and xenograft implantation.-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling pathway was markedly activated in EGFR-TKI primary resistant H1975 cells as compared to EGFR-TKI acquired  cells (PC-9GR, H1650-M3) and EGFR-TKI sensitivity cells (PC-9, HCC827). Inhibition of IGF-1R activity by AG-1024 (a small molecule of IGF-1R inhibitor), as well as downregulation of IGF-1R by siRNA, significantly enhanced the ability of Gef to suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis in H1975 cells via the inhibition of AKT activation and subsequent upregulation of Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (BIM). Interestingly, the observation showed that Met combined with Gef treatment had similar tumor growth suppression effects in comparison with the addition of AG-1024 to therapy with Gef. A clear synergistic antiproliferative interaction between Met and Gef was observed with a combination index (CI) value of 0.65. Notably, IGF-1R silencing mediated by RNA interference (RNAi) attenuated anticancer effects of Met without obviously resensitizing H1975 cells to Gef. Finally, Met-based combinatorial therapy effectively blocked tumor growth in the xenograft with TKI primary resistant lung cancer cells.Our findings demonstrated that Met combined with Gef would be a promising strategy to overcome EGFR-TKI primary  via suppressing IGF-1R signaling pathway in NSCLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30347867> Polysaccharide Improves  Sensitivity via AMPK Activation in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes.</a></h2><p> polysaccharide (APS) is an important bioactive component of  which is used as an anti-diabetes herb in traditional Chinese medicine.

Two challenging aspects are selective inhibition and cell permeability. A structure-based strategy was employed to develop uncharged bromophenols as a new series of PTP1B inhibitors. The most potent compound 22 (LXQ46) inhibited PTP1B with an IC value of 0.190 μM, and showed remarkable selectivity over other protein  phosphatases (PTPs, 20-200 folds). In the SPR study, increasing concentrations of compound 22 led to concentration-dependent increases in binding responses, indicating that compound 22 could bind to the surface of PTP1B via noncovalent means. By treating -resistant C2C12 myotubes with compound 22, enhanced  and leptin signaling pathways were observed. Long-term oral administration of compound 22 reduced the blood glucose level of diabetic BKS db mice. The glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and  tolerance tests (ITT) in BKS db mice showed that oral administration of compound 22 could increase  sensitivity. In addition, long-term oral administration of compound 22 could protect mice from obesity, which was not the result of toxicity. Our pharmacokinetics results from the rat-based assays showed that orally administered compound 22 was absorbed rapidly from the gastrointestinal tract, extensively distributed to the tissues, and rapidly eliminated from the body.

We identified plasma metabolites associating with different cardiometabolic risk factors (adiposity, cholesterol, , and inflammation) in monozygotic (MZ) twins. Additionally, we assessed if metabolite profiling can identify subgroups differing by cardiometabolic risk factors.We quantified 111 plasma metabolites (Acquity UPLC-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry), and measured blood lipids, HOMA index, CRP, and adiposity (BMI, %bodyfat by DEXA, fat distribution by MRI) in 40 MZ twin pairs (mean BMI 27.9 kg/m, age 30.7). We determined associations among individuals (via linear regression) between metabolites and clinical phenotypes, and assessed, with within-twin pair analysis, if these associations were free from genetic confounding. We also performed cluster analysis to identify distinct subgroups based on subjects' metabolite profiles.We identified 42 metabolite-phenotype associations (FDR < 0.05), 19 remained significant after controlling for shared factors within the twin pairs. Aspartate, propionylcarnitine,  hexanoylcarnitine, and deoxycytidine associated positively with two or more adiposity measures. HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) associated negatively and BMI positively with the most numbers of metabolites; 12 were unique for HDL-C and 3 for BMI. Metabolites associating with HDL-C had the strongest effect size. Metabolite profiling revealed two distinct subgroups of individuals, differing by 32 metabolites (p < 0.05), and by total and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). Forty-two metabolites predicted subgroup membership in correlation with total cholesterol and 45 metabolites predicted subgroup membership in correlation with LDL-C.Different fat depots share metabolites associating with general adiposity.

In mice, the deletion of  receptor substrate type 2 (Irs2) causes peripheral  and reduction in β-cell mass, leading to overt diabetes, with gender differences on adrenergic signaling. To further unravel the relevance of Irs2 on glycemic control, we analyzed in adult Irs2 deficient (Irs2) mice, of both sexes but still normoglycemic, dopamine effects on  secretion and glycerol release, as well as their adrenal medulla by an immunohistochemical and morphologic approach. In isolated islets, 10 μM dopamine significantly inhibited  release in wild-type (WT) and female Irs2 mice; however, male Irs2 islets were insensitive to that catecholamine. Similarly, on isolated adipocytes, gender differences were observed between WT and Irs2 mice in basal and evoked glycerol release with crescent concentrations of dopamine. By immunohistochemistry, reactivity to  hydroxylase (TH) in female mice was significantly higher in the adrenal medulla of Irs2 compared to WT; although no differences for TH-immunopositivity were observed between the male groups of mice. However, compared to their corresponding WT animals, adrenomedullary chromaffin cells of Irs2 mice showed a significant decrease in the cellular and nuclear areas, and even in their percentage of apoptosis. Therefore, our observations suggest that, together with gender differences on dopamine responses in Irs2 mice, disturbances in adrenomedullary chromaffin cells could be related to deficiency of Irs2. Accordingly, Irs2 could be necessary for adequate glucose homeostasis and maintenance of the population of the adrenomedullary chromaffin cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30486685>Effect of sub-toxic exposure to Malathion on glucose uptake and  signaling in L6 myoblast derived myotubes.</a></h2><p>Biochemical basis of Malathion exposure-induced diabetes mellitus is not known.

Paraoxonase (PON) activity was measured in cell lysate using p-nitrophenyl acetate as substrate. PON1 and PON2 expression in myotubes were assessed by PCR. The glucose uptake and total antioxidant level in L6-derived myotubes after sub-toxic exposure to Malathion were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Phosphorylation levels of RSKs (JNK, p38MAPK and IκBα component of NFκB) were increased and that of IRS-1 and Akt on  stimulation was decreased following Malathion exposure as compared to those in controls. PON1 and PON2 genes were expressed in myotubes with and without Malathion exposure. Significant PON activity was present in cell lysate. We conclude that sub-toxic Malathion exposure induces oxidative stress in muscle cells activating RSKs that impairs  signaling and thereby -stimulated glucose uptake in muscle cells. This probably explains the biochemical basis of Malathion-induced  state and diabetes mellitus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30745299>Bad to the Bone: The Role of the -Like Growth Factor Axis in Osseous Metastasis.</a></h2><p>Bone metastases are a frequent complication of cancer that are associated with considerable morbidity. Current treatments may temporarily palliate the symptoms of bone metastases but often fail to delay their progression. Bones provide a permissive environment because they are characterized by dynamic turnover, secreting factors required for bone maintenance but also stimulating the establishment and growth of metastases. -like growth factors (IGF) are the most abundant growth factors in bone and are required for normal skeletal development and function. Via activation of the IGF-1 receptors (IGF-1R) and variant  receptors, IGFs promote cancer progression, aggressiveness, and treatment . Of specific relevance to bone biology, IGFs contribute to the homing, dormancy, colonization, and expansion of bone metastases. Furthermore, preclinical evidence suggests that tumor cells can be primed to metastasize to bone by a high IGF-1 environment in the primary tumor, suggesting that bone metastases may reflect IGF dependency. Therapeutic targeting of the IGF axis may therefore provide an effective method for treating bone metastases. Indeed, anti-IGF-1R antibodies, IGF-1R  kinase inhibitors, and anti-IGF-1/2 antibodies have demonstrated antitumor activity in preclinical models of prostate and breast cancer metastases, either alone or in combination with other agents. Several studies suggest that such treatments can inhibit bone metastases without affecting growth of the primary tumor. Although previous trials of anti-IGF-1R drugs have generated negative results in unselected patients, these considerations suggest that future clinical trials of IGF-targeted agents may be warranted in patients with bone metastases.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301539>Boswellic extracts and 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids prevent type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus by suppressing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.</a></h2><p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease directed to the pancreatic islets where inflammation leads to the death of -producing ß cells and  deficiency. Type 2 diabetes, which is closely related to overweight, is characterized by . In both cases, proinflammatory cytokines play an important role by causing insulitis and . The gum resin of Boswellia species and its pharmacologically active compounds, including 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids have been shown to suppress the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in various immune-competent cells.To review the present evidence of the therapeutic effects of boswellic extracts (BE) and/or 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids in the prevention/treatment of diabetes mellitus and to provide comprehensive insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms.This review considers all available informations from preclinical and clinical studies concerning BEs, 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids, proinflammatory cytokines and diabetes mellitus collected via electronic search (PubMed) and related publications of the author.Type 1 diabetes: Studies in mice with autoimmune diabetes revealed that in the model of multiple injections of low doses of streptozotocin (MLD-STZ), an extract of the gum resin of Boswellia serrata and 11-keto-ß-boswellic acid (KBA) suppressed the increase in proinflammatory cytokines in the blood, infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and increase in blood glucose. In a second model, i.e. the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, KBA prevented the infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets. Regarding the clinical effects, a case report provided evidence that BE suppressed the blood levels of  phosphatase antibody (IA-A), a marker for insulitis, in a patient with late-onset autoimmune diabetes of the adult (LADA). Type 2 diabetes: In a preclinical study in rats where obesity was alimentary induced, the administration of BE significantly reduced food intake, overweight, proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and ameliorated the parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism. Similar results were obtained in a second animal study, where type 2 diabetes was induced by a combination of a high-fat/high-fructose diet and a single dose of streptozotocin. Two clinical trials with patients with type 2 diabetes receiving the resin of Boswellia serrata demonstrated improvement in the blood glucose, HbA and lipid parameters.Preclinical and clinical data suggest that BE and/or 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids by inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines from immune-competent cells, may prevent insulitis and  in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively, and therefore may be an option in the treatment/prevention of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It is hypothesized that molecularly, BE and 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids act via interference with the IκB kinase/Nuclear Transcription Factor-κB (IKK/NF-κB) signaling pathway through inhibition of the phosphorylation activity of IKK.

Investigation of new inhibitors with good bioavailability and high selectivity is the major challenge of drug discovery program targeting PTP1B. Therefore, herein, new neutral benzene-sulfonamide containing compounds were designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated as potent PTP1B inhibitors. New series of thiazolidine, oxazolidine, thiazinan, oxazinan, oxazole, thiazole, tetrazole, cyanopyridine, chromenone, and iminochromene of benzene-sulfonamide derivatives (MSE-1 to MSE-15) were synthesized in a good yield under mild condition using sulfadiazine as a starting material. Among the synthesized compounds, MSE-13 and MSE-14 showed the most in vitro potent PTP-1B inhibitory activity (IC of 0.88 µM and 3.33 µM, respectively). Animal treatment by the target compounds significantly improved the , diminished plasma glucose level, decreased initial body weight, and normalized the serum lipid profile compared to pioglitazone, a standard PTP1B inhibitor. The molecular modeling study showed a high affinity and selectivity of our synthesized compounds to the active site and B-site of PTP1B holding hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, Electrostatic Surface Potential (ESP) and HOMO/LUMO analysis indicated the importance of sulfamoyl moiety for PTP1B binding. In silico ADME predictions of such compounds also showed the promising pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties.

On the other hand, aging is related to the cognitive decline and is the main risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The Protein- Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is related to several deleterious processes in neurons and emerges as a promising target for new therapies. In this context, our study aims to investigate the age-related changes in PTP1B content,  signaling, β-amyloid content, and Tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus of middle-aged rats. Young (3 months) and middle-aged (17 months) Wistar rats were submitted to Morris-water maze (MWM) test,  tolerance test, and molecular analysis in the hippocampus. Aging resulted in increased body weight, and  and decreases learning process in MWM. Interestingly, the middle-aged rats have higher levels of PTP-1B, lower phosphorylation of IRS-1, Akt, GSK3β, mTOR, and TrkB. Also, the aging process increased Tau phosphorylation and β-amyloid content in the hippocampus region.

Herein, we report that early growth response gene-1 ( Egr-1) is activated by  in skeletal muscle and provides feedback inhibition that regulates  sensitivity after a meal. The inhibition of the transcriptional activity of Egr-1 enhanced the phosphorylation of the  receptor (InsR) and Akt, thus increasing glucose uptake in L6 myotubes after  stimulation, whereas overexpression of Egr-1 decreased  sensitivity. Furthermore, deletion of Egr-1 in the skeletal muscle improved systemic  sensitivity and glucose tolerance, which resulted in lower blood glucose levels after refeeding. Mechanistic analysis demonstrated that EGR-1 inhibited InsR phosphorylation and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle by binding to the proximal promoter region of protein  phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) and directly activating transcription. PTP1B knockdown largely restored  sensitivity and enhanced glucose uptake, even under conditions of EGR-1 overexpression. Our results indicate that EGR-1/PTP1B signaling negatively regulates postprandial  sensitivity and suggest a potential therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of excessive glucose absorption.-Wu, J., Tao, W.-W., Chong, D.-Y., Lai, S.-S., Wang, C., Liu, Q., Zhang, T.-Y., Xue, B., Li, C.-J.

Experimental rats were induced by high fat diet feeding coupled with combined exposure to streptozotocin and nicotinamide. Treatment with EAF improved glucose tolerance and lipid profiles, but the  secretion was unaltered. Gene expression analyses on /adipocytokine signalling-related genes demonstrated tissue-specific transcriptional responses. In skeletal muscle and liver tissues, Socs1, Tnf and Mapk8 showed consistent transcript regulation. Furthermore, hepatic translational analyses revealed sensitization on proximal  signalling, with reduced expression of IRS1 serine phosphorylation, increased IRS1  phosphorylation and increased phospho-AKT (Ser473). The present findings suggested that EAF exerted its effect by modulating  signalling, potentially via IRS1/AKT activation.

S6K1 hyperactivation due to overnutrition leads to hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes. Our recent study showed that A77 1726, the active metabolite of the anti-rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug leflunomide, is an inhibitor of S6K1. Whether leflunomide can control hyperglycemia and sensitize the  receptor has not been tested. Here we report that A77 1726 increased AKT and S6K1 phosphorylation but decreased S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, C2C12 and L6 myotubes. A77 1726 increased  receptor  phosphorylation and binding of the p85 subunit of the PI-3 kinase to IRS-1. A77 1726 enhanced -stimulated glucose uptake in L6 myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and enhanced -stimulated glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation to the plasma membrane of L6 cells. Finally, we investigated the anti-hyperglycemic effect of leflunomide on  and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetes mouse models. Leflunomide treatment normalized blood glucose levels and overcame  in glucose and  tolerance tests in  and HFD-fed mice but had no effect on mice fed a normal chow diet (NCD). Leflunomide treatment increased AKT phosphorylation in the fat and muscle of  mice but not in normal mice.

Lipid intermediates may reduce protein loss, but the roles of free fatty acids (FFAs) and ketone bodies during acute inflammation are unclear.We aimed to test whether infusions of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3OHB), FFAs, and saline reduce protein catabolism during exposure to LPS and Acipimox (to restrict and control endogenous lipolysis).A total of 10 healthy male subjects were randomly tested 3 times, with: 1) LPS, Acipimox (Olbetam) and saline, 2) LPS, Acipimox, and nonesterified fatty acids (Intralipid), and 3) LPS, Acipimox, and 3OHB, during a 5-h basal period and a 2-h hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp. Labeled phenylalanine, , and urea tracers were used to estimate protein kinetics, and muscle biopsies were taken for Western blot analysis of protein metabolic signaling.3OHB infusion increased 3OHB concentrations (P < 0.0005) to 3.5 mM and decreased whole-body phenylalanine-to- degradation. Basal and -stimulated net forearm phenylalanine release decreased by >70% (P < 0.005), with both appearance and phenylalanine disappearance being profoundly decreased. Phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α at Ser51 was increased in skeletal muscle, and S6 kinase phosphorylation at Ser235/236 tended (P = 0.074) to be decreased with 3OHB infusion (suggesting inhibition of protein synthesis), whereas no detectable effects were seen on markers of protein breakdown. Lipid infusion did not affect phenylalanine kinetics, and  sensitivity was unaffected by interventions.During acute inflammation, 3OHB has potent anticatabolic actions in muscle and at the whole-body level; in muscle, reduction of protein breakdown overrides inhibition of synthesis.

The intervention (QDTS granules and valsartan) started when the mice were 12 weeks old. C57BL/6 mice were used as normal control. The urine albumin excretion ratio (UAER) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) before and after the intervention. The IRS-1, PI3K, Akt, and MAPK proteins expression and the phosphorylation levels were detected by western blot.QDTS granules reduced the 24-h urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE) in db/db mice with type 2 DM and attenuated the pathological changes of the kidney. QDTS granules also increased the activation level of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and reduced .

However, knowledge of these relationships is lacking in children, despite the growing public health problem posed by childhood obesity. The aim of this study was to assess whether plasma-free amino acid profiles can serve as useful biomarkers of lifestyle-related diseases in children with obesity.This retrospective study used the medical records of 26 patients (15 male, 11 female) aged 9 or 10 years presenting with moderate to severe obesity and hyperlipidemia between April 2015 and March 2017. A degree of obesity of 30% or more was defined as moderate or severe. Amino acid levels were compared between obese children with and without impaired glucose tolerance using a t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. In addition, the influence of factors such as intima media thickness, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, amino acids, and homeostasis model assessment- (HOMA-IR) were analyzed pairwise using Pearson's correlation or Spearman's rank correlation.HOMA-IR was positively correlated with valine, leucine (Leu), isoleucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, threonine, lysine, alanine, , glutamate (Glu), proline, arginine, ornithine, total free amino acids (all P < 0.01), and aspartate (P = 0.010). Moreover, blood uric acid levels were positively correlated with Leu (P = 0.005) and Glu (P = 0.019), and negatively correlated with serine, glycine, and asparagine (P = 0.007, P = 0.003, and P = 0.013, respectively).Amino acid profile reflects impaired glucose tolerance and hyperuricemia at an early stage of obesity.

Glut4 expression levels are correlated with whole-body glucose homeostasis.  signaling is known to recruit Glut4 to the cell surface. Expression of Glut4 is subject to tissue-specific hormonal and metabolic regulation. The molecular mechanisms regulating skeletal muscle Glut4 expression remain to be elucidated. Myostatin (Mstn) is reported to be involved in the regulation of energy metabolism. While elevated Mstn levels in muscle are associated with obesity and type-2 diabetes in both human and mouse models, Mstn null mice exhibit immunity to dietary-induced obesity and . The molecular mechanisms by which Mstn initiates the development of  and disorders of glucose disposal are not well delineated. Here we investigated effects of Mstn on  action in C2C12 cells. Mstn significantly reduced basal and -induced IRS-1  (Tyr495) phosphorylation, and expression and activation of PI3K, associated with diminished AKT phosphorylation and elevated GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser9. In addition, Mstn inhibited Glut4 mRNA and protein expression, and reduced -induced Glut4 membrane translocation and glucose uptake. Conversely, SB431542, a Smad2/3 inhibitor, significantly increased cellular response to . Mstn decreased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity accompanied by reduced Glut4 gene expression and glucose uptake, which were partially reversed by AICAR, an AMPK activator. These data suggest that Mstn inhibits Glut4 expression and -induced Glut4 integration into cytoplasmic membranes and glucose uptake and that these changes are mediated by direct -desensitizing effect and indirect suppression of AMPK activation.© 2018 The Authors.

There are reports suggesting that  is associated with the development of albuminuria in nondiabetic individuals. We have previously reported reduced  receptor (IR) expression in renal-tubular-epithelial cells, including PT in various models of . However, the effect of a physiological fall in  levels and the role for IR in PT in tubular albumin uptake is not clear. To address these gaps in our understanding, we estimated urine excretion and renal uptake of albumin in fasted and fed C57Bl/6 mice injected with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-albumin (5 µg/mL/kg body weight, intraperitoneal, n = 6 per group). In addition, we compared spot urine analysis from 33 clinically healthy humans after overnight fasting (when  levels are lower than in the fed state) and then at 2 hours after 75 g oral glucose challenge (postprandial). Fasted mice had attenuated renal uptake of FITC-albumin and higher excretion in urine, relative to fed mice ( P = 0.04). Moreover, a significant drop in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and urine albumin concentration (UAC) was observed in the postprandial state in these subjects ( P = 0.001 and P = 0.017, for ACR and UAC, respectively). The drop was negatively associated with postprandial blood glucose levels (ρ = -0.36, P = 0.03 for ΔUAC and ρ = -0.34, P = 0.05 for ΔACR). To test the role of IR in PT, we analyzed 24-hour urine albumin excretion in male mice with targeted deletion of IR from PT ( receptor knockout [IRKO]) and their wild-type (WT) littermates ( n = 7 per group). IRKO mice had significantly higher 24-hour urine albumin excretion relative to WT. Moreover, kidneys from KO mice revealed reduced expression of megalin and cubulin proteins in the PT relative to the WT. We also demonstrated  (100 nM) induced albumin internalization in human proximal tubule cells (hPT) and this effect of  was attenuated in hydroxy-2-naphthalenylmethylphosphonic acid (100 µM), a  kinase inhibitor, pretreated hPT. Our findings revealed albumin excretion was attenuated by glucose administration to fasting individuals implying a regulatory role for  in PT albumin reabsorption.

MerTK is mainly expressed in anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages where it mediates transcriptional changes including suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancement of inflammatory repressors. MerTK is regulated by metabolic pathways through nuclear sensors including LXRs, PPARs, and RXRs, in response to apoptotic bodies or to other sources of cholesterol. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. It is a clinicopathological syndrome closely related to obesity, , and oxidative stress. It includes a spectrum of conditions ranging from simple steatosis, characterized by hepatic fat accumulation with or without inflammation, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), defined by hepatic fat deposition with hepatocellular damage, inflammation, and accumulating fibrosis. Several studies support an association between NAFLD and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, a major cause of death worldwide. This pathological condition consists in a chronic and progressive inflammatory process in the intimal layer of large- and medium-sized arteries. The complications of advanced atherosclerosis include chronic or acute ischemic damage in the tissue perfused by the affected artery, leading to cellular death. By identifying specific targets influencing lipid metabolism and cardiovascular-related diseases, the present review highlights the role of MerTK in NAFLD-associated atherosclerotic lesions as a potential innovative therapeutic target. Therapeutic advantages might derive from the use of compounds selective for nuclear receptors targeting PPARs rather than LXRs regulating macrophage lipid metabolism and macrophage mediated inflammation, by favoring the expression of MerTK, which mediates an immunoregulatory action with a reduction in inflammation and in atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30005910>Anti-diabetic effect and mechanism of Kursi Wufarikun Ziyabit in L6 rat skeletal muscle cells.</a></h2><p>Kursi Wufarikun Ziyabit (KWZ) is a traditional prescription that used in folk tea drinking for its health care effect in treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in central Asia.

This study designed to observe the effect of KWZ on glucose consumption and assess the molecular mechanism on associated proteins in  signaling and ER stress pathway in L6 rat skeletal muscle cells. The results showed that, KWZ exhibited proteins of PTP-1B and α-glycosidase inhibitory activity in vitro. No cytotoxicity of KWZ was found on L6 cell line.

PI3K-dependent Akt phosphorylation was found to be activated by KWZ. Moreover, the -mediated induction of IRS-1 and GSK-3 were also activated by KWZ. Western blot results indicated that KWZ significantly improved the levels of ER stress proteins, which reduced the expression of GRP78, enhanced the expression of the PERK, eIF2α and XBP1s. The activation of PERK/eIF2α was likely consequence of GRP78 inhibition, and this might be beneficial for improving the stability of ER and alleviating .

NPM-ALK, an oncogenic  kinase, plays a critical role in this lymphoma. Recently, selective ALK inhibitors have emerged as a first-line therapy for this neoplasm. Unfortunately, ALK inhibitors were hindered by emergence of  and relapse. We have previously demonstrated that type I -like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) is commonly expressed and activated in this lymphoma. In addition, IGF-IR and NPM-ALK are physically associated and reciprocally enhance their phosphorylation/activation. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that combined inhibition of IGF-IR and NPM-ALK could significantly improve the effects of inhibiting each kinase alone.We used clinically utilized inhibitors of IGF-IR (picropodophyllin; PPP) and ALK (ASP3026) to assess the in vitro cellular effects of combined treatment versus treatment using a single agent. Moreover, we used a systemic NPM-ALK T cell lymphoma mouse model to analyze the in vivo effects of PPP and ASP3026 alone or in combination.Our data show that combined treatment with PPP and ASP3026 decreased the viability, proliferation, and anchorage-independent colony formation, and increased apoptosis of NPM-ALK T cell lymphoma cells in vitro. The in vitro effects of combined treatment were synergistic and significantly more pronounced than the effects of PPP or ASP3026 alone. Biochemically, simultaneous antagonism of IGF-IR and ALK induced more pronounced decrease in pIGF-IR, pNPM-ALK, and pSTAT3 levels than antagonizing IGF-IR or ALK alone. Moreover, combined targeting of IGF-IR and NPM-ALK decreased significantly systemic lymphoma tumor growth and improved mice survival in vivo. Consistent with the in vitro results, the in vivo effects of the combined therapy were more pronounced than the effects of targeting IGF-IR or ALK alone.Combined targeting of IGF-IR and ALK is more effective than targeting IGF-IR or ALK alone in NPM-ALK T cell lymphoma. This strategy might also limit emergence of  to high doses of ALK inhibitors. Therefore, it could represent a successful therapeutic approach to eradicate this aggressive lymphoma. Importantly, combined inhibition is feasible because of the clinical availability of IGF-IR and ALK inhibitors. Our findings are applicable to other types of cancer where IGF-IR and ALK are simultaneously expressed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30459283>Integrated proximal proteomics reveals IRS2 as a determinant of cell survival in ALK-driven neuroblastoma.</a></h2><p>Oncogenic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is one of the few druggable targets in neuroblastoma, and therapy  to ALK-targeting  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) comprises an inevitable clinical challenge. Therefore, a better understanding of the oncogenic signaling network rewiring driven by ALK is necessary to improve and guide future therapies. Here, we performed quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics on neuroblastoma cells treated with one of three clinically relevant ALK TKIs (crizotinib, LDK378, or lorlatinib) or an experimentally used ALK TKI (TAE684) to unravel aberrant ALK signaling pathways. Our integrated proximal proteomics (IPP) strategy included multiple signaling layers, such as the ALK interactome, phosphotyrosine interactome, phosphoproteome, and proteome. We identified the signaling adaptor protein IRS2 ( receptor substrate 2) as a major ALK target and an ALK TKI-sensitive signaling node in neuroblastoma cells driven by oncogenic ALK. TKI treatment decreased the recruitment of IRS2 to ALK and reduced the  phosphorylation of IRS2. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated depletion of ALK or IRS2 decreased the phosphorylation of the survival-promoting kinase Akt and of a downstream target, the transcription factor FoxO3, and reduced the viability of three ALK-driven neuroblastoma cell lines. Collectively, our IPP analysis provides insight into the proximal architecture of oncogenic ALK signaling by revealing IRS2 as an adaptor protein that links ALK to neuroblastoma cell survival through the Akt-FoxO3 signaling axis.Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The percentage of the small adipocytes (25-75 μm) was 30% higher in Prep1 animals than in the WT, with a reciprocal difference in the large adipose cells (100-150 and >150 μm). -stimulated  receptor  and Akt serine phosphorylation markedly increased in Prep1 mice, paralleled by 3-fold higher glucose uptake and a significant increase of proadipogenic genes such as C/EBPα, GLUT4, and FABP4. Moreover, T cells infiltration and TNF-α, IFNγ and leptin expression were reduced in adipose tissue from Prep1 mice, while adiponectin levels were 2-fold higher. Furthermore, Prep1 mature adipocytes released lower amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and higher amount of adiponectin compared to WT cells. Incubation of murine liver cell line (NMuLi) with conditioned media (CM) from mature adipocytes of Prep1 mice improved glucose metabolism, while those from WT mice had no effect. Consistent with these data, Prep1 overexpression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes impaired adipogenesis and  signaling, and increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion. All these findings suggest that Prep1 silencing reduces inflammatory response and increases  sensitivity in adipose tissue. In addition, CM from mature adipocytes of Prep1 mice improve metabolism in hepatic cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Chronic inflammation is considered part of the pathogenic mechanisms of different disorders associated with aging. Interestingly, peripheral inflammation and the associated metabolic alterations not only facilitate  and diabetes but also neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, the identification of novel pathways, common to the development of these diseases, which modulate the immune response and signaling is key. It will provide highly relevant information to advance our knowledge of the multifactorial process of aging, and to establish new biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets to counteract the underlying chronic inflammatory processes. One novel pathway that regulates peripheral and central immune responses is triggered by the cytokines pleiotrophin (PTN) and midkine (MK), which bind its receptor, Receptor Protein  Phosphatase (RPTP) β/ζ, and inactivate its phosphatase activity. In this review, we compile a growing body of knowledge suggesting that PTN and MK modulate the immune response and/or inflammation in different pathologies characterized by peripheral inflammation associated with , such as aging, and in central disorders characterized by overt neuroinflammation, such as neurodegenerative diseases and endotoxemia. Evidence strongly suggests that regulation of the PTN and MK signaling pathways may provide new therapeutic opportunities particularly in those neurological disorders characterized by increased PTN and/or MK cerebral levels and neuroinflammation. Importantly, we discuss existing therapeutics, and others being developed, that modulate these signaling pathways, and their potential use in pathologies characterized by overt neuroinflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31228482>Amino acid signature predictive of incident prediabetes: A case-control study nested within the longitudinal pathobiology of prediabetes in a biracial cohort.</a></h2><p>Circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs, isoleucine, leucine, valine) and aromatic amino acids (AAAs,  and phenylalanine) predicted type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk in a Caucasian population. Here, we assessed amino acid levels in relation to incident prediabetes among initially normoglycemic African Americans (AA) and European Americans (EA).Using a nested case-control design, we studied 70 adults (35 AA, 35 EA) who developed prediabetes (progressors) and 70 matched participants who maintained normoglycemia (nonprogressors) during 5.5 years of follow-up in the Pathobiology of Prediabetes in a Biracial Cohort study. Assessments included plasma amino acid levels,  sensitivity, and beta-cell function.The total level of all 18 amino acid assayed was significantly associated with lean mass (r = 0.36, P < 0.0001), waist circumference (r = 0.27, P = 0.001), fasting plasma glucose (r = 0.24, P = 0.005), HOMA-IR (r = 0.22, P = 0.01) and HDL cholesterol (r = -0.18, P = 0.03). Individual amino acid levels were significantly associated with  sensitivity and  secretion. Compared with nonprogressors, progressors had higher baseline levels of asparagine and aspartic acid (P <0.0001), glutamine/glutamic acid (P = 0.005) and phenylalanine (P = 0.02), and lower histidine (P = 0.02) levels. In fully-adjusted logistic regression models, aspartic acid/asparagine (OR 2.72 [95% CI 1.91-3.87]) and histidine (OR 0.90 [95% CI 0.85-0.96]) were the only amino acids that significantly predicted incident prediabetes.Baseline plasma aspartic acid and asparagine levels predicted progression to prediabetes, whereas histidine levels were protective of prediabetes risk. Thus, the amino acid signature associated with prediabetes in a diverse population may be distinct from that previously linked to T2DM in Caucasians.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, we tried to find the mechanisms behind these AA alterations.Twenty AAs, TNF-α, and IL-6 were analyzed in fasting serum samples from a total of 198 individuals (56 drug-naïve patients with T2DM, 69 patients IFG, and 73 healthy controls). The C2C12 mouse myoblast cell lines were used to examine the changes of MAFbx and MuRF1 expressions, which are muscle specific E3 ligases acting as major mediators of skeletal muscle proteolysis, after development of  induced by palmitate treatment.In addition to branched chain amino acids BCAAs, fasting serum AAs such as glutamic acid, lysine, phenylalanine, arginine, alanine, , aspartic acid, were higher in patients with T2DM and intermediately elevated in patients with IFG compared with normoglycemic controls. These serum AA concentrations positively correlated with fasting glucose, homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR), and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, HOMA-IR and pro-inflammatory cytokines were two important independent predictors of serum AA levels. In vitro experiments showed that palmitate treatment in C2C12 myotubes induced , increased pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression, and increased MAFbx gene and protein expression.The increase in fasting serum AAs can be an early manifestation of . Increased muscle proteolysis induced by  and inflammatory cytokines can be a possible mechanism for the rise in serum AA levels.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

PYY3-36 twice a day for one week). Food intake, water intake, body weight (b.w.), visceral fat weight (VFW), liver glycogen content, serum levels of glucose, , and interleukin-6 (IL-6), were measured. Homeostatic-model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) was estimated. The gene expression of the hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and visceral nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) were assessed by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).The PYY3-36 administration to the diabetic group of rats significantly increased the serum  levels and liver glycogen content, decreased the body weight, VFW, food intake, water intake, serum levels of the glucose, IL-6, and HOMA-IR. It also decreased the expression of both the hypothalamic NPY and the visceral fat NF-κB.With respect to the fact of improved  release and enhanced  sensitivity (an effect that may be mediated via suppressing accumulation of visceral fat and inflammatory markers), in the rats treated with PYY3-36, the PYY3-36 might be considered for the future as a promising therapeutic tool in T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29259227>Inhibition of C1-Ten PTPase activity reduces  through IRS-1 and AMPK pathways.</a></h2><p> causes type 2 diabetes; therefore, increasing  sensitivity is a therapeutic approach against type 2 diabetes. Activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an effective approach for treating diabetes, and reduced  receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) protein levels have been suggested as a molecular mechanism causing . Thus, dual targeting of AMPK and IRS-1 might provide an ideal way to treat diabetes. We found that 15,16-dihydrotanshinone I (DHTS), as a C1-Ten protein  phosphatase inhibitor, increased IRS-1 stability, improved glucose tolerance and reduced muscle atrophy. Identification of DHTS as a C1-Ten inhibitor revealed a new function of C1-Ten in AMPK inhibition, possibly through regulation of IRS-1. These findings suggest that C1-Ten inhibition by DHTS could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for -associated metabolic syndrome through dual targeting of IRS-1 and AMPK.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30502680>Chia oil supplementation changes body composition and activates  signaling cascade in skeletal muscle tissue of obese animals.</a></h2><p>Chia seed oil is the richest source of plant-based ω-3 fatty acid, α-linolenic acid, but its potential and mechanisms of action to treat obesity are unclear. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of chia oil (ChOi) supplementation on body composition and  signaling in skeletal muscles of obese mice.Male C57 BL/6 mice (n = 8/group) were fed regular control chow or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 135 d. Another HFD group additionally received ChOi from 90 to 135 d.Consumption of ChOi reduced fat mass accumulation and increased lean mass as evidenced by nuclear magnetic resonance. Moreover, obese mice treated with ChOi showed higher  phosphorylation of  receptor substrate 1, greater activation of protein kinase B, and increased translocation of glucose transporter type 4 in skeletal muscle tissue in response to . ChOi supplementation improved glucose levels and  tolerance; decreased serum , leptin, and triacylglycerols; and increased blood high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. All these effects caused by the use of ChOi seemed to be independent of the resolution of inflammation because the markers of inflammation were not altered in animals fed the HFD.The molecular effects observed in muscle tissue together with changes in body composition may have contributed to the increased glucose tolerance and to the healthy phenotype presented by obese animals treated with ChOi.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the study was to analyze pre- and post-natal growth, clinical features and laboratory findings in a small for gestational age (SGA) girl in whom discordant postnatal growth persisted and her appropriate for gestational age (AGA) brother.A girl born with a low weight and length [-2.3 and -2.4 standard deviation (SD) score (SDS), respectively] but borderline low head circumference (-1.6 SD) presented with a height of -1.7 SDS, in contrast to a normal height twin brother (0.0 SDS). IGF-1  was suspected because of elevated serum IGF-1 levels.Sequencing revealed the presence of a previously described pathogenic heterozygous mutation (p.Glu1050Lys) in the SGA girl which was not present in the parents nor in the AGA twin brother.The pathogenic  mutation in this girl led to intrauterine growth retardation followed by partial postnatal catch-up growth.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying T-cell-mediated inflammation in adipose tissue remain largely unknown.Sixty apolipoprotein E (ApoE-/-) mice were randomly divided into chow and diabetes groups. Diabetes was induced by a high-fat and high-sugar diet combined with low-dose streptozotocin. Then we transferred a recombinant adenovirus carrying the protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) gene into epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT) of ApoE-/- mice. After transfection, all mice were euthanized to evaluate the effects of PTPN2 on T cells polarization and atherosclerosis.PTPN2 was downregulated in EWAT of diabetic ApoE-/- mice. PTPN2 overexpression in EWAT reversed the high Th1/Treg and Th17/Treg ratios in EWAT of diabetic mice. In addition, PTPN2 overexpression in EWAT could significantly reduce macrophages infiltration, the ratio of M1/M2 macrophages and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in EWAT, improving . In aortic root lesions, the vulnerability index were significantly decreased by overexpression of PTPN2 in EWAT.These data suggested that PTPN2 overexpression in EWAT would inhibit systemic inflammation and increase the plaque stability via T cells polarization shift in diabetic mice.© 2018 The Author(s).

In fact, IIGFs is often deregulated in cancer. In particular, the mitogenic  receptor isoform A (IR-A) and the -like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) are frequently overexpressed in cancer together with their cognate ligands IGF-1 and IGF-2. Recently, we identified discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) as a new IR-A interacting protein. DDR1, a non-integrin collagen  kinase receptor, is overexpressed in several malignancies and plays a role in cancer progression and metastasis. Herein, we review recent findings indicating that DDR1 is as a novel modulator of IR and IGF-1R expression and function. DDR1 functionally interacts with IR and IGF-1R and enhances the biological actions of , IGF-1 and IGF-2. Conversely, DDR1 is upregulated by IGF-1, IGF-2 and  through the PI3K/AKT/miR-199a-5p circuit. Furthermore, we discuss the role of the non-canonical estrogen receptor GPER1 in the DDR1-IIGFs crosstalk. These data suggest a wider role of DDR1 as a regulator of cell response to hormones, growth factors, and signals coming from the extracellular matrix.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29524491>Knockdown of LMW-PTP enhances stress  in Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h2><p>Low molecular weight protein  phosphatase (LMW-PTP) is highly conserved across almost all living organisms and is involved in the modulation of a number of cellular proteins related to important signaling pathways. In this study, we isolated lmwptp (Y94H6A.7) of Caenorhabditis elegans, the homolog of human ACP1, and set up an effective feeding-based RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown against this gene. We found that knockdown of lmwptp decreased damage associated with heat shock, oxidative stress and UV irradiation in wild-type worms, however, its deficiency didn't further reduce the stress  of daf-16 or hsf-1 mutants and didn't further increase the stress sensitivity associated with age-1, akt-1 or akt-2 mutants, but it enhanced the stress  of daf-2 mutants. Further studies demonstrated that this stress tolerance could be attributed to increased daf-16 nuclear accumulation and enhanced expression of both superoxide dismutase-3 protein (SOD-3) and heat shock protein-16.2 (HSP-16.2) in response to stress. Additionally, quantitative real-time PCR results showed that the expression of hsf-1 and its target genes were up-regulated in lmwptp-knockdown worms under stress conditions. Together these results indicated that lmwptp is related to stress  of worms, and it is likely associated with the /IGF-1-like signaling (IIS) pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the metabolic response of FO to  and type 2 diabetes is still inconsistent. This study aimed to explore the effect of FO on chronic high fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis, , and inflammation, mainly focusing on hepatic n-3 fatty acid remodeling and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) affect  signaling, and low ROS levels can act as a signal to regulate cellular function. Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are highly abundant and widely expressed antioxidant enzymes. However, it is unclear whether antioxidant enzymes, such as Prx2, mediate  signaling. The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of Prx2 deficiency on  signaling. Our western blot results showed that Prx2 deficiency enhanced  signaling and increased oxidation of protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) treated with . In addition, we assessed ROS levels with a Cytosol-HyPer HO sensor. As a result, increased ROS levels and Akt activation were decreased by N-acetyl-cysteine (Nac), which acted as an antioxidant in Prx2-deficient MEFs. Body weight measurements and glucose tolerance test (GTT) revealed significant body weight reduction and increase in glucose clearance in Prx2 mice fed a high-fat diet. Interestingly, glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) was significantly higher in Prx2 mice than in wild-type mice according to western blotting results. Western blotting also revealed that Akt phosphorylation was higher in Prx2 MEFs and muscle tissue than in wild-type. Together, our findings indicate that increased ROS due to Prx2 deficiency promotes  sensitivity and glucose clearance in skeletal muscles by increasing protein  phosphatase (PTPs) oxidation. These results provide novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms of  signaling induced by Prx2 deficiency and suggest that ROS-based therapeutic strategies can be used to suppress .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Outcome measurements of metabolic responses, inflammatory markers and gut bacterial composition were analysed at the end of each 42-day supplementation period.Both IPE and inulin supplementation improved  compared with cellulose supplementation, measured by homeostatic model assessment 2 (mean±SEM 1.23±0.17 IPE vs 1.59±0.17 cellulose, p=0.001; 1.17±0.15 inulin vs 1.59±0.17 cellulose, p=0.009), with no differences between IPE and inulin (p=0.272). Fasting  was only associated positively with plasma  and negatively with plasma glycine following inulin supplementation. IPE supplementation decreased proinflammatory interleukin-8 levels compared with cellulose, while inulin had no impact on the systemic inflammatory markers studied. Inulin promoted changes in gut bacterial populations at the class level (increased Actinobacteria and decreased Clostridia) and order level (decreased Clostridiales) compared with cellulose, with small differences at the species level observed between IPE and cellulose.These data demonstrate a distinctive physiological impact of raising colonic propionate delivery in humans, as improvements in  sensitivity promoted by IPE and inulin were accompanied with different effects on the plasma metabolome, gut bacterial populations and markers of systemic inflammation.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Drug discovery efforts are therefore crucially dependent on identifying individual molecular targets and validating their relevance to human disease. The current review discusses bioactive compounds from medicinal plants offering enhanced therapeutic potential for the combined patho-physiology of diabetes and obesity. We have demonstrated that 3β-taraxerol a pentacyclic triterpenoid (14-taraxeren-3-ol) isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of Mangifera indica, chlorogenic acid isolated from the methanol extract of Cichorium intybus, methyl tetracosanoate from the methanol extract of Costus pictus and vitalboside A derived from methanolic extract of Syzygium cumini exhibited significant effects on  stimulated glucose uptake causing  sensitizing effects on 3T3L1 adipocytes (an in vitro model mimicking adipocytes). Whereas, (3β)-stigmast-5-en-3-ol isolated from Adathoda vasica and Aloe emodin isolated from Cassia fistula showed significant  mimetic effects favoring glucose uptake in L6 myotubes (an in vitro model mimicking skeletal muscle cells).

This study seeks to identify a causal relationship between 20-HETE and obesity-driven . Cyp4a14 male mice, a model of 20-HETE overproduction, were fed a regular or high-fat diet (HFD) for 15 wk. 20-SOLA [2,5,8,11,14,17-hexaoxanonadecan-19-yl 20-hydroxyeicosa-6( Z),15( Z)-dienoate], a 20-HETE antagonist, was administered from week 0 or week 7 of HFD.

A key diagnostic of the metabolic syndrome is  in both peripheral tissues and brain, especially in the hypothalamus. Since the anorexigenic hormone 17β-estradiol (E2) regulates food intake in part by inhibiting the excitability of the hypothalamic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons, we hypothesized that E2 would protect against  in NPY/AgRP neurons with diet-induced obesity (DIO). Therefore, we did whole-cell recordings and single cell qPCR in arcuate NPYGFP neurons from both female and male mice to test the efficacy of  with DIO. The resting membrane potential and input  of NPY/AgRP neurons was significantly increased in DIO versus control-diet fed males. Most notably, the efficacy of  to activate KATP channels in NPY/AgRP neurons was significantly attenuated, although the KATP channel opener diazoxide was fully effective in NPY/AgRP neurons from DIO males, indicating that the KATP channels were expressed and functional. In contrast,  was fully efficacious to activate KATP channels in DIO females, and the response was reversed by the KATP channel blocker tolbutamide. However, the ability of  to activate KATP channels was abrogated with ovariectomy but fully restored with E2 replacement. The  in obese males was likely mediated by an increase in suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3), protein  phosphatase B (PTP1B) and T cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP) activity since the expression of all three mRNAs were upregulated in the obese males but not in females. As proof of principle, pre-incubation of hypothalamic slices from DIO males with the PTP1B/TCPTP inhibitor CX08005 completely rescued the effects of .

Although Type A IR requires appropriate intervention from the early stages of diabetes, proper diagnosis of this disease is challenging, and accumulation of cases with detailed clinical profiles and genotypes is required.Herein we report on six peripubertal patients with clinically diagnosed Type A IR, including four patients with an identified INSR mutation. To clarify the clinical features of Type A IR due to INSR mutation, we validated the clinical characteristics of Type A IR patients with identified INSR mutations by comparing them with mutation-negative patients.Four heterozygous missense mutations within the β-subunit of INSR were detected: Gly1146Arg, Arg1158Trp, Arg1201Trp, and one novel Arg1201Pro mutation. There were no obvious differences in clinical phenotypes, except for normal lipid metabolism and autosomal dominant inheritance, between Type A IR due to INSR mutations and Type A IR due to other factors. However, our analysis revealed that the extent of growth retardation during the fetal period is correlated with the severity of  signaling impairment.The present study details the clinical features of four patients with genetically proven Type A IR. Further accumulation of genetically proven cases and long-term treatment prognoses following early diagnosis are required to further elucidate the dynamics of this disease.© 2018 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29716918>The IGF2/IR/IGF1R Pathway in Tumor Cells and Myofibroblasts Mediates  to EGFR Inhibition in Cholangiocarcinoma.</a></h2><p> Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a desmoplastic tumor of the biliary tree in which epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed and contributes to cancer progression. Although EGFR has been envisaged as a target for therapy, treatment with  kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as erlotinib did not provide therapeutic benefit in patients with CCA, emphasizing the need to investigate  mechanisms against EGFR inhibition. Resistant CCA cells to EGFR inhibition were obtained upon long-time exposure of cells with erlotinib. Cell signaling, viability, migration, and spheroid growth were determined , and tumor growth was evaluated in CCA xenograft models. Erlotinib-resistant CCA cells displayed metastasis-associated signatures that correlated with a marked change in cell plasticity associated with an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and a cancer stem cell (CSC)-like phenotype. Resistant cells exhibited an upregulation of  receptor (IR) and -like growth factor (IGF) 1 receptor (IGF1R), along with an increase in IGF2 expression. IR/IGF1R inhibition reduced EMT and CSC-like traits in resistant cells. , tumors developed from resistant CCA cells were larger and exhibited a more prominent stromal compartment, enriched in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF). Pharmacological coinhibition of EGFR and IR/IGF1R reduced tumor growth and stromal compartment in resistant tumors. Modeling of CCA-CAF crosstalk showed that IGF2 expressed by fibroblasts boosted IR/IGF1R signaling in resistant cells. Furthermore, IR/IGF1R signaling positively regulated fibroblast proliferation and activation. To escape EGFR-TKI treatment, CCA tumor cells develop an adaptive mechanism by undergoing an IR/IGF1R-dependent phenotypic switch, involving a contribution of stromal cells. .©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30576689>Ectopic lipid deposition mediates  in adipose specific 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 transgenic mice.</a></h2><p>Excessive adipose glucocorticoid action is associated with , but the mechanisms linking adipose glucocorticoid action to  are still debated. We hypothesized that  from excess glucocorticoid action may be attributed in part to increased ectopic lipid deposition in liver.We tested this hypothesis in the adipose specific 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (HSD11B1) transgenic mouse, an established model of adipose glucocorticoid excess. Tissue specific  action was assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, hepatic lipid content was measured, hepatic  signaling was assessed by immunoblotting. The role of hepatic lipid content was further probed by administration of the functionally liver-targeted mitochondrial uncoupler, Controlled Release Mitochondrial Protonophore (CRMP).High fat diet fed HSD11B1 transgenic mice developed more severe hepatic  than littermate controls (endogenous suppression of hepatic glucose production was reduced by 3.8-fold, P < 0.05); this was reflected by decreased -stimulated hepatic  receptor kinase  phosphorylation and AKT serine phosphorylation.

The human  gene has been identified as a prominent risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Met gene-altered mice serve as useful models for mechanistic studies of ASD. Inactivation of  in excitatory cortical neurons in mice ( mice) yields a phenotype in which significantly decreased GABA receptor-mediated inhibition shifts the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance toward excitation in the somatosensory cortex. Further, unlike that seen in wild-type mice,  does not increase inhibition in the mutant cortex, suggesting that one of the consequences of kinase inactive  gene could be desensitization of  receptors. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of  receptor sensitizer, pioglitazone, on inhibition in the somatosensory thalamocortical circuitry.We used whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology and analyzed excitatory and inhibitory responses of cortical layer IV excitatory cells following stimulation of their thalamic input in thalamocortical pathway intact brain slices. We applied  alone and  + a thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone (PIO), to test the effects of sensitizing  receptors on inhibitory responses mediated by GABA receptors in the somatosensory cortex of  mice.In WT brain slices, application of  together with PIO did not enhance the effect of  alone. In contrast, PIO application induced a much larger inhibition than that of  alone in -defective cortex. Thus,  of GABA receptor-mediated response in  mutant mice may result from desensitized  receptors.Sporadic clinical studies reported improved behavioral symptoms in children with autism following PIO treatment.

Patients with metastatic RCC have an unusually poor prognosis and near-universal  to all current therapies. To improve RCC treatment and the survival rate of patients with RCC, there is an urgent need to reveal the mechanisms by which metabolic reprogramming regulates aberrant signaling and oncogenic progression. Through an integrated analysis of RCC metabolic pathways, we showed that methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) and its substrate methylthioadenosine (MTA) are dysregulated in aggressive RCC. A decrease in MTAP expression was observed in RCC tissues and correlated with higher tumor grade and shorter overall survival. Genetic manipulation of MTAP demonstrated that MTAP expression inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion and migration of RCC cells. Interestingly, we found a decrease in the protein methylation level with a concomitant increase in  phosphorylation after MTAP knockout. A phospho-kinase array screen identified the type 1 -like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) as the candidate with the highest upregulation in  phosphorylation in response to MTAP loss. We further demonstrated that IGF1R phosphorylation acts upstream of Src and STAT3 signaling in MTAP-knockout RCC cells. IGF1R suppression by a selective inhibitor of IGF1R, linsitinib, impaired the cell migration and invasion capability of MTAP-deleted cells. Surprisingly, an increase in linsitinib-mediated cytotoxicity occurred in RCC cells with MTAP deficiency. Our data suggest that IGF1R signaling is a driver pathway that contributes to the aggressive nature of MTAP-deleted RCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620715>Metformin improves ovarian  signaling alterations caused by fetal programming.</a></h2><p> is the decreased ability of  to mediate metabolic actions. In the ovary,  controls ovulation and oocyte quality. Alterations in ovarian  signaling pathway could compromise ovarian physiology. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of fetal programming on ovarian  signaling and evaluate the effect of metformin treatment. Pregnant rats were hyperandrogenized with testosterone and female offspring born to those dams were employed; at adulthood, prenatally hyperandrogenized (PH) offspring presented two phenotypes: irregular ovulatory (PHiov) and anovulatory (PHanov). Half of each group was orally treated with metformin. Metformin treatment improved the estrous cyclicity in both PH groups. Both PH groups showed low mRNA levels of IR, IRS1 and Glut4. IRS2 was decreased only in PHanov. Metformin upregulated the mRNA levels of some of the mediators studied. Protein expression of IR, IRS1/2 and GLUT4 was decreased in both PH groups. In PHiov, metformin restored the expression of all the mediators, whereas, in PHanov, metformin restored only that of IR and IRS1/2. IRS1 phosphorylation was measured in  residues, which activates the pathway, and in serine residues, which impairs  action. PHiov presented high IRS1 phosphorylation on  and serine residues, whereas PHanov showed high serine phosphorylation and low  phosphorylation. Metformin treatment lowered serine phosphorylation only in PHanov rats. Our results suggest that PHanov rats have a defective  action, partially restored with metformin.

Here, we report that mice without CDP138 develop obesity under normal chow diet (NCD) or high-fat diet (HFD) conditions. CDP138 mice have lower energy expenditure, oxygen consumption, and body temperature than wild-type (WT) mice. CDP138 is exclusively expressed in adrenal medulla and is colocalized with  hydroxylase (TH), a marker of sympathetic nervous terminals, in the inguinal fat. Compared with WT controls, CDP138 mice had altered catecholamine levels in circulation, adrenal gland, and inguinal fat. Adrenergic signaling on cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) phosphorylation induced by cold challenge but not by an exogenous β3 adrenoceptor against CL316243 were decreased in adipose tissues of CDP138 mice. Cold-induced beige fat browning, fatty acid oxidation, thermogenesis, and related gene expression were reduced in CDP138 mice. CDP138 mice are also prone to HFD-induced , as assessed by Akt phosphorylation and glucose transport in skeletal muscles. Our data indicate that CDP138 is a regulator of stress response and plays a significant role in adipose tissue browning, energy balance, and  sensitivity through regulating catecholamine secretion from the sympathetic nervous terminals and adrenal gland.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30186410>Identification of key pathways and biomarkers in sorafenib-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma using bioinformatics analysis.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant types of cancer, with a high mortality rate. Sorafenib is the sole approved oral clinical therapy against advanced HCC. However, individual patients exhibit varying responses to sorafenib and the development of sorafenib  has been a new challenge for its clinical efficacy. The current study identified gene biomarkers and key pathways in sorafenib-resistant HCC using bioinformatics analysis. Gene dataset GSE73571 was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, including four sorafenib-acquired resistant and three sorafenib-sensitive HCC phenotypes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the web tool GEO2R. Functional and pathway enrichment of DEGs were analyzed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins and Cytoscape. A total of 1,319 DEGs were selected, which included 593 upregulated and 726 downregulated genes. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis revealed DEGs enriched in negative regulation of endopeptidase activity, cholesterol homeostasis, DNA replication and repair, coagulation cascades, , RNA transport, cell cycle and others. Eight hub genes, including kininogen 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, apolipoprotein C3, alpha 2-HS glycoprotein, erb-b2 receptor  kinase 2, secreted protein acidic and cysteine rich, vitronectin and vimentin were identified from the PPI network.

Bovine  increased the capacity of the PG cell membrane to phosphorylate exogenous substrate poly (Glu:Tyr 4:1) and the glucose uptake in the control crab group. The crabs were submitted to three periods of hyperosmotic (HR) and hyposmotic (HO) stress, for 24, 72 and 144 h, to investigate the -like receptor phosphorylation capacity of gills. Acclimation to HO for 24 h or HR for 144 h of stress inhibited the effects of  in the PG, decreasing the capacity of  to phosphorylate exogenous substrate poly (Glu:Tyr 4:1) and decreasing the glucose uptake. Hyperosmotic stress for the same period of 144 h significantly affected I- binding in the AG and PG. However, HO stress for 24 h significantly reduced I--specific uptake only in the PG. Therefore, osmotic stress induces alterations in the gill -like receptors that decrease  binding in the PG. These findings indicate that osmotic stress induced a pattern of  in the PG. The free-glucose concentration in the PG decreased during acclimation to 144 h of HR stress and 24 h of HO stress. This decrease in the cell free-glucose concentration was not accompanied by a significant change in hemolymph glucose levels. In AG from the control group, neither the capacity of bovine  to phosphorylate exogenous substrate poly (Glu:Tyr 4:1) nor the glucose uptake changed; however, genistein decreased -kinase activity, confirming that this receptor belongs to the -kinase family. Acclimation to HO (24 h) or HR (144 h) stress decreased -kinase activity in the AG. This study provided new information on the mechanisms involved in the osmoregulation process in crustaceans, demonstrating for the first time in an estuarine crab that osmotic challenge inhibited -like signaling and the effect of  on glucose uptake in the PG.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

During aging, these faculties decline, as does  signaling. The mechanism behind this last phenomenon is unclear. In recent studies, we reported that the mild and gradual loss of cholesterol in the synaptic fraction of hippocampal neurons during aging leads to a decrease in synaptic plasticity evoked by glutamate receptor activation and also by receptor  kinase (RTK) signaling. As  and  growth factor activity are dependent on  kinase receptors, we investigated whether the constitutive loss of brain cholesterol is also involved in the decay of  function with age. Using long-term depression (LTD) induced by application of  to hippocampal slices as a read-out, we found that the decline in  function during aging could be monitored as a progressive impairment of -LTD. The application of a cholesterol inclusion complex, which donates cholesterol to the membrane and increases membrane cholesterol levels, rescued the  signaling deficit and -LTD. In contrast, extraction of cholesterol from hippocampal neurons of adult mice produced the opposite effect. Furthermore, in vivo inhibition of Cyp46A1, an enzyme involved in brain cholesterol loss with age, improved  signaling. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments pointed to a change in receptor conformation by reduced membrane cholesterol, favoring ligand-independent autophosphorylation. Together, these results indicate that changes in membrane fluidity of brain cells during aging play a key role in the decay of synaptic plasticity and cognition that occurs at this late stage of life.© 2019 The Authors.

Significant increases in oral glucose tolerance-tested (OGTT),  tolerance-tested, and non-fasting blood glucose levels were observed in mice on a HFD, as well as the significant increases in OGTT and non-fasting plasma  levels. Mice on a HFD had decreased plasma adiponectin levels and increased free fatty acid (FFA) levels. Supplementary SeMet significantly augmented OGTT blood glucose levels in mice on a HFD and plasma FFA levels in mice on a normal diet. The mRNA levels of six selenoproteins were measured, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) 1 and selenoprotein P (SelP) were selected as candidates that may be associated with  or oxidative stress in the liver. Hepatic GPx1 expression was elevated in mice on a HFD and SeMet supplementation, and SelP expression increased in mice on a HFD. Histopathological observations in hepatic tissues showed hypertrophy of parenchymal cells and significant expression of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal in mice on a HFD, indicating lipid accumulation and oxidative stress induction. Hepatic protein  phosphatase activity also increased by a HFD. These results suggest that hepatic lipid accumulation in NSY mice on a HFD promoted oxidative stress and hepatic SelP expression, and supplementary SeMet induced hepatic GPx1 expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679477>Beneficial effects of murtilla extract and madecassic acid on  sensitivity and endothelial function in a model of diet-induced obesity.</a></h2><p>Infusions of murtilla leaves exhibit antioxidant, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Several compounds that are structurally similar to madecassic acid (MA), a component of murtilla leaf extract (ethyl acetate extract, EAE), have been shown to inhibit protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1P). The aim of this study was to evaluate if EAE and two compounds identified in EAE (MA and myricetin [MYR]) could have a beneficial effect on systemic and vascular  sensitivity and endothelial function in a model of diet-induced obesity. Experiments were performed in 5-week-old male C57BL6J mice fed with a standard (LF) or a very high-fat diet (HF) for 4 weeks and treated with EAE, MA, MYR, or the vehicle as control (C). EAE significantly inhibited PTP1B. EAE and MA, but not MYR, significantly improved systemic  sensitivity in HF mice and vascular relaxation to Ach in aorta segments, due to a significant increase of eNOS phosphorylation and enhanced nitric oxide availability. EAE, MA, and MYR also accounted for increased relaxant responses to  in HF mice, thus evidencing that the treatments significantly improved aortic  sensitivity.

Intriguingly, inflammation and RAS can activate each other, forming a positive feedback loop that would result in exacerbated unwanted tissue damage. To further examine the interrelationship among  signaling, neuroinflammation and RAS in the brain, the effect of repeated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure and co-treatment with the angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor type 1 (AT1) blocker, candesartan (Cand), on anxiety and depression-like behaviors, RAS, neuroinflammation and  signaling was explored. Our results demonstrated that prolonged LPS challenge successfully induced the rats into anxiety and depression-like state, accompanied with significant neural apoptosis and neuroinflammation. LPS also activated RAS as evidenced by the enhanced angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) expression, Ang II generation and AT1 expression. However, blocking the activated RAS with Cand co-treatment conferred neurobehavioral protective properties. The AT1 blocker markedly ameliorated the microglial activation, the enhanced gene expression of the proinflammatory cytokines and the overactivated NF-κB signaling. In addition, Cand also mitigated the LPS-induced disturbance of  signaling with the normalized phosphorylation of serine 307 and  896 of  receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Collectively, the present study, for the first time, provided the direct evidence indicating that the inflammatory condition may interact with RAS to impede brain  pathway, resulting in neurobehavioral damage, and inhibiting RAS seems to be a promising strategy to block the cross-talk and cut off the vicious cycle between RAS and immune system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29505315>A putative role for Discoidin Domain Receptor 1 in cancer chemoresistance.</a></h2><p>The Discoidin Domain Receptor 1 (DDR1) receptor  kinase performs pleiotropic functions in the control of cell adhesion, proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion.

Leptin has emerged as a major regulator of energy balance through its actions in the hypothalamus. Importantly, obese people exhibit high circulating levels of leptin, yet the hypothalamus no longer responds normally to this hormone to suppress appetite or to increase energy expenditure. Several well-known hypotheses have been proposed to explain impaired central responsiveness to the effects of leptin in obesity, including defective transit across the blood-brain barrier at the arcuate nucleus, hypothalamic endoplasmic reticulum stress, maladaptive sterile inflammation in the hypothalamus, and overexpression of molecules that may inhibit leptin signaling. We also discuss a new explanation that is based on our group's recent discovery of a signaling pathway that we named "NSAPP" after its five main protein components. The NSAPP pathway consists of an oxide transport chain that causes a transient, targeted burst in intracellular hydrogen peroxide (HO) to inactivate redox-sensitive members of the protein  phosphatase gene family. The NSAPP oxide transport chain is required for full activation of canonical leptin signaling in neurons but fails to function normally in states of overnutrition. Remarkably, leptin and  both require the NSAPP oxide transport chain, suggesting that a defect in this pathway could explain simultaneous  to the appetite-suppressing effects of both hormones in obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30237882>Aptamer-based search for correlates of plasma and serum water T: implications for early metabolic dysregulation and metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of abnormalities that increases the risk for type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis.

In a prior study, water T was analyzed against ~ 130 strategically selected proteins and metabolites to identify associations with , inflammation and dyslipidemia. In the current study, the analysis was broadened ten-fold using a modified aptamer (SOMAmer) library, enabling an unbiased search for new proteins correlated with water T and thus, metabolic health.Water T measurements were recorded using fasting plasma and serum from non-diabetic human subjects. In parallel, plasma samples were analyzed using a SOMAscan assay that employed modified DNA aptamers to determine the relative concentrations of 1310 proteins. A multi-step statistical analysis was performed to identify the biomarkers most predictive of water T. The steps included Spearman rank correlation, followed by principal components analysis with variable clustering, random forests for biomarker selection, and regression trees for biomarker ranking.The multi-step analysis unveiled five new proteins most predictive of water T: hepatocyte growth factor, receptor  kinase FLT3, bone sialoprotein 2, glucokinase regulatory protein and endothelial cell-specific molecule 1. Three of the five strongest predictors of water T have been previously implicated in cardiometabolic diseases. Hepatocyte growth factor has been associated with incident type 2 diabetes, and endothelial cell specific molecule 1, with atherosclerosis in subjects with diabetes. Glucokinase regulatory protein plays a critical role in hepatic glucose uptake and metabolism and is a drug target for type 2 diabetes.

We evaluated the EGFR-TKI sensitivity of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell line (PC-9) treated with condition media (CM) from 18 cases of CAFs and matched non-cancerous-tissue-associated fibroblasts (NCAFs). We measured the expression levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), interleukin-6, fibroblast growth factor-2, -like growth factor-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor-A in CAFs and NCAFs. We examined whether HGF neutralizing antibody could annul the EGFR-TKI  induced by CM from CAFs. Compared to CM from NCAFs, CM from CAFs increased the  of PC-9 cells to EGFR-TKI in five out of 18 cases. Relative expression ratio of HGF messenger RNA was significantly higher in these five CAFs compared to others (P = 0.0013), whereas other cytokines were not. In four of these five cases, the addition of HGF neutralizing antibody significantly decreased the survival ratio of PC-9 cells.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) can directly contribute to  by disrupting the  signalling pathway via protein- phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) activation, especially in adipocytes. Infliximab (Remicade ) is a TNF-alpha-neutralizing antibody that has not been fully studied in . We investigated the effect of infliximab on TNF-alpha-induced  in 3T3L1 adipocytes in vitro, and examined the possible molecular mechanisms involved. Once differentiated, adipocytes were cultured with 5 mmol L 2-deoxy-D-glucose- H and stimulated twice with 2 μmol L , in the presence or absence of 5 ng/mL TNF-alpha and/or 10 ng/mL infliximab. Glucose uptake was measured every 20 minutes for 2 hour, and phosphorylated forms of  receptor (IR),  receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2), protein kinase B (AKT) and PTP1B were determined by Western blotting. TNF-alpha-treated adipocytes showed a significant 64% decrease in -stimulated glucose uptake as compared with control cells, whereas infliximab reversed TNF-alpha actions by significantly improving glucose incorporation. Although IR phosphorylation remained unaltered, TNF-alpha was able to increase PTP1B activation and decrease phosphorylation of IRS-2 and AKT. Notably, infliximab restored phosphorylation of IRS-2 and AKT by attenuating PTP1B activation. This work demonstrates for the first time that infliximab ameliorates TNF-alpha-induced  in 3T3L1 adipocytes in vitro by restoring the  signalling pathway via PTP1B inhibition. Further clinical research is needed to determine the potential benefit of using infliximab for treating  in patients.© 2018 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893514>GC-(4→8)-GCG, A Proanthocyanidin Dimer from Camellia ptilophylla, Modulates Obesity and Adipose Tissue Inflammation in High-Fat Diet Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>Excessive fat accumulation in adipose tissue leads to obesity and related chronic inflammation. This study aims to examine the effects of gallocatechin -(4→8)-gallocatechin-3-O-gallate (GC-(4→8)-GCG), a main proanthocyanidin dimer from Camellia ptilophylla (Cocoa tea), on adipocyte- and adipose-related inflammation in vivo and in vitro.C57BL/6 mice are fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and GC-(4→8)-GCG (40 or 80 mg kg d ) for 8 weeks. The metabolic profiles, adipose tissue hypertrophy, macrophage infiltration, and inflammatory cytokine production are investigated. Additionally, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes are utilized to investigate the effect of GC-(4→8)-GCG on preadipocyte differentiation and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-stimulated inflammatory response in vitro. GC-(4→8)-GCG supplementation decreases HFD-induced epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) hypertrophy, suppresses proinflammatory cytokine production and macrophage infiltration in eWAT, and improves  sensitivity in HFD-induced obese mice. In vitro, GC-(4→8)-GCG shows a strong anti-adipogenic potential in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte by inhibiting the expression of key adipogenic transcription factors and decreasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB, Janus  kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT3) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.GC-(4→8)-GCG can modulate obesity and improve obesity-related  by inhibiting preadipocyte differentiation and the related proinflammatory responses.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this study, we prospectively examined the associations between serum metabolites and T2D risk in a Korean community-based cohort (the Ansan-Ansung cohort). Data were obtained from 1,939 participants with available metabolic profiles and without diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or cancer at baseline. The acylcarnitine, amino acid, amine, and phospholipid levels in fasting serum samples were analyzed by targeted metabolomics. During the 8-year follow-up period, we identified 282 cases of incident T2D. Of all metabolites measured, 22 were significantly associated with T2D risk. Specifically, serum levels of alanine, arginine, isoleucine, proline, , valine, hexose and five phosphatidylcholine diacyls were positively associated with T2D risk, whereas lyso-phosphatidylcholine acyl C17:0 and C18:2 and other glycerophospholipids were negatively associated with T2D risk. The associated metabolites were further correlated with T2D-relevant risk factors such as  and triglyceride indices. In addition, a healthier diet (as measured by the modified recommended food score) was independently associated with T2D risk. Alterations of metabolites such as amino acids and choline-containing phospholipids appear to be associated with T2D risk in Korean adults.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894682>ROR1-CAVIN3 interaction required for caveolae-dependent endocytosis and pro-survival signaling in lung adenocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>The receptor  kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is a transcriptional target of the lineage-survival oncogene NKX2-1/TTF-1 in lung adenocarcinomas. In addition to its kinase-dependent role, ROR1 functions as a scaffold protein to facilitate interaction between caveolin-1 (CAV1) and CAVIN1, and consequently maintains caveolae formation, which in turn sustains pro-survival signaling toward AKT from multiple receptor  kinases (RTKs), including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), MET (proto-oncogene, receptor  kinase), and IGF-IR (-like growth factor receptor 1). Therefore, ROR1 is an attractive target for overcoming EGFR-TKI  due to various mechanisms such as EGFR T790M double mutation and bypass signaling from other RTKs. Here, we report that ROR1 possesses a novel scaffold function indispensable for efficient caveolae-dependent endocytosis. CAVIN3 was found to bind with ROR1 at a site distinct from sites for CAV1 and CAVIN1, a novel function required for proper CAVIN3 subcellular localization and caveolae-dependent endocytosis, but not caveolae formation itself. Furthermore, evidence of a mechanistic link between ROR1-CAVIN3 interaction and consequential caveolae trafficking, which was found to utilize a binding site distinct from those for ROR1 interactions with CAV1 and CAVIN1, with RTK-mediated pro-survival signaling towards AKT in early endosomes in lung adenocarcinoma cells was also obtained. The present findings warrant future study to enable development of novel therapeutic strategies for inhibiting the multifaceted scaffold functions of ROR1 in order to reduce the intolerable death toll from this devastating cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30729097>Survivin in -Like Growth Factor-Induced  to Lapatinib in Head and Neck Squamous Carcinoma Cells.</a></h2><p>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors have limited efficacy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) due to various  mechanisms, such as activation of the -like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R), which initiates pro-survival signaling. Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins family, is expressed at relatively high levels in malignant tissues and plays a role in cell division. Expression of survivin in tumors has been shown to correlate with poor prognosis due to chemotherapy  and anti-apoptotic behavior. We previously demonstrated that activation of the IGF1R reduces sensitivity to EGFR- kinase inhibitors (TKIs) via reduced apoptosis suggesting a role of survivin in this process. This study evaluates the role of survivin in IGF1R-mediated lapatinib . Using HNSCC cell lines FaDu and SCC25, survivin expression increased and lapatinib sensitivity decreased with IGF1R activation. Further, these effects were reversed by the survivin inhibitor YM-155. Conversely, survivin expression and lapatinib sensitivity were unchanged with IGF1R activation in UNC10 cells. YM-155 enhanced the inhibitory effect of lapatinib on UNC10 cells, regardless of activation of the IGF1R. These results demonstrate that enhanced survivin expression correlates with IGF1R-mediated lapatinib  in HNSCC cells and suggest that regulation of survivin expression may be a key mechanistic element in IGF1R-based therapeutic . Combinatorial treatment with survivin antagonists and EGFR-TKIs warrants further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875680>Vertical sleeve gastrectomy improves liver and hypothalamic functions in obese mice.</a></h2><p>Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) is an effective surgery to treat obesity and diabetes. However, the direct effect of VSG on metabolic functions is not fully understood. We aimed to investigate if alterations in hypothalamic neurons were linked with perturbations in liver metabolism after VSG in an energy intake-controlled obese mouse model. C57BL/6 and hrNPY-GFP reporter mice received HFD for 12 weeks and were then divided into three groups: Sham (ad lib), sham (pair-fed) with VSG, and VSG. Food intake was measured daily, and blood glucose levels were measured before and after the study. Energy expenditure and body composition were determined. Serum parameters, liver lipid and glycogen contents were measured, and gene/protein expression were analyzed. Hypothalamic POMC, AgRP/NPY, and  hydroxylase expressing neurons were counted. As results, we found that VSG reduced body weight gain and adiposity induced by HFD, increased energy expenditure independent of energy intake. Fed and fasted blood glucose levels were reduced in the VSG group. While serum active GLP-1 level was increased, the active ghrelin and triglycerides levels were decreased along with improved  in VSG group. Liver lipid accumulation, glycogen content, and gluconeogenic gene expression were reduced in the VSG group. In the hypothalamus, TH expressing neuron population was decreased, and the POMC-expressing neuron population was increased in the VSG group. Our data suggests that VSG improves metabolic symptoms by increasing energy expenditure and lowering lipid and glycogen contents in the liver. These physiological alterations are possibly related to changes in hypothalamic neuron populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29769704>Effect of protocatechuic acid on  responsiveness and inflammation in visceral adipose tissue from obese individuals: possible role for PTP1B.</a></h2><p>The occurrence of chronic inflammation in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in obese subjects precipitates the development of  and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Anthocyanins and their main metabolite protocatechuic acid (PCA) have been demonstrated to stimulate  signaling in human adipocytes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether PCA is able to modulate  responsiveness and inflammation in VAT from obese (OB) and normal weight (NW) subjects.VATs obtained from NW and OB subjects were incubated or not (control) with 100 μM PCA for 24 h. After incubation, tissues untreated and treated with PCA were acutely stimulated with  (20 nM, 20 min). PTP1B, p65 NF-κB, phospho-p65 NF-κB, IRS-1, IRβ, Akt, GLUT4 as well as basal and -stimulated Tyr-IRS-1 and Ser-Akt phosphorylations were assessed by Western blotting in NW- and OB-VAT. Samples were assessed for PTP1B activity and adipocytokine secretion.PCA restored -induced phosphorylation in OB-VAT by increasing phospho-Tyr-IRS-1 and phospho-Ser-Akt after  stimulation as observed in NW-VAT (p < 0.05). PTP1B activity was lower in OB-VAT treated with PCA with respect to untreated (p < 0.05). Compared to non-treated tissues, PCA reduced phospho-p65 NF-κB and IL-6 in OB-VAT, and IL-1β in NW-VAT (p < 0.05); and increased adiponectin secretion in NW-VAT (p < 0.05).PCA restores the  responsiveness of OB-VAT by increasing IRS-1 and Akt phosphorylation which could be related with the lower PTP1B activity found in PCA-treated OB-VAT. Furthermore, PCA diminishes inflammation in VAT. These results support the beneficial role of an anthocyanin-rich diet against inflammation and  in obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29469970>Glimepiride treatment in a patient with type A  syndrome due to a novel heterozygous missense mutation in the  receptor gene.</a></h2><p>Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea known to have unique  mimetic and sensitizing effects. We aimed to study the efficacy of glimepiride in a patient with type A  syndrome.A 15-year-old girl with type A  syndrome was treated with glimpiride for 6 months. Self-monitoring of blood glucose was recorded, and oral glucose tolerance tests on glucose and  were measured during the treatment. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp was used to evaluate whole-body  sensitivity before and after the treatment.A novel heterozygous missense mutation at exon 19 (c.3427A>T) in the  kinase domain of the INSR gene was identified, causing an amino acid replacement of phenylalanine for isoleucine at codon 1143 (Ile1143Phe). Before the treatment, the patient's glycated hemoglobin was 7.0%, plasma glucose during oral glucose tolerance test was 6.7, 12.8 and 17.3 mmol/L, and simultaneous serum  was 80.7, 137.5 and >300 μU/mL. There were no significant differences between self-monitored blood glucose measured at each time-point among different glimepiride dosages, or during the 14 weeks when glimepiride was used at its maximal dosage (6 mg/day). Oral glucose tolerance test showed little change in plasma glucose and serum . Glycated hemoglobin decreased by 0.8% after the treatment. However, a euglycemic clamp study showed that the M value decreased from 5.25 to 2.90 mg/kg/min, showing increased .Treatment with glimepiride did not improve  sensitivity in a patient with type A  syndrome carrying Ile1143Phe heterozygous mutation in the INSR gene. Large-scale long-term studies assembled worldwide are required to optimize treatment algorithms for patients with type A  syndrome.© 2018 The Authors.

Herein, we reported a highly specific PTP1B inhibitor 2,2',3,3'-tetrabromo-4,4',5,5'-tetrahydroxydiphenylmethane (compound 1), which showed promising hypoglycemic activity in diabetic BKS db mice. With the IC value of 2.4 μM, compound 1 could directly bind to the catalytic pocket of PTP1B through a series of hydrogen bonds. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that the target affinity [KD (equilibrium dissociation constant) value] of compound 1 binding to PTP1B was 2.90 μM. Moreover, compound 1 could activate the  signaling pathway in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. We further evaluated the long-term effects of compound 1 in diabetic BKS db mice. Notably, oral administration of compound 1 significantly reduced the blood glucose levels of diabetic mice with increasing  sensitivity. In addition, the dyslipidemia of diabetic mice was also significantly improved by compound 1 gavage. The histological experiments showed that compound 1 treatment significantly ameliorated the disordered hepatic and pancreatic architecture and increased the glycogen content in the liver tissues as well as improved the  secretion function of pancreas. Taken together, our results manifested that the natural product compound 1 was a highly specific PTP1B inhibitor, which could activate  signaling pathway and ameliorate hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia in diabetic BKS db mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853337>Role and mechanism of homocysteine in affecting hepatic protein- phosphatase 1B.</a></h2><p>Elevated homocysteine is epidemiologically related to . Protein- phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a negative regulator of  signaling. However, the effect of homocysteine on PTP1B remains unclear.S-homocysteinylated PTP1B was identified by LC-ESI-MS/MS. The ability of thioredoxin system to recover active PTP1B from S-homocysteinylated PTP1B was confirmed by RNA interference. To address the mechanism for homocysteine to affect PTP1B activity, we performed 5-IAF insertion, activity assays, Western blotting, co-immunoprecipitation and glucose uptake experiments.The thiol-containing form of homocysteine (HcySH) suppressed phosphorylation of  receptor-β subunit, but enhanced PTP1B activity. This phenomenon was partially related to the fact that HcySH promoted PTP1B expression. Although the disulfide-bonded form of homocysteine (HSSH) modified PTP1B to form an inactive S-homocysteinylated PTP1B, HcySH-induced increase in the activities of cellular thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase, components of thioredoxin system, could recover active PTP1B from S-homocysteinylated PTP1B. Thioredoxin system transferred electrons from NADPH to S-homocysteinylated PTP1B, regenerating active PTP1B in vitro and in hepatocytes. The actions of HcySH were also related with decrease in hepatic glucose uptake.The effect of HcySH/HSSH on PTP1B activity depends, at least partially, on the ratio of active PTP1B and S-homocysteinylated PTP1B. High HcySH-induced an increase in thioredoxin system activity is beneficial to de-S-homocysteinylation and is good for PTP1B activity.Our data provide a novel insight into post-translational regulation of PTP1B, and expand the biological functions of thioredoxin system.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The CB undergoes structural and functional changes during perinatal development, in response to a variety of environmental stimuli and in pathological conditions. Knowing that the CB acts as a metabolic sensor involved in the control of peripheral  sensitivity and that its overactivation contributes to the genesis of metabolic disturbances, herein we tested if diet-induced  is associated with morphological alterations in the proportion of type I and type II cells in the CB. Diet induced  resistant model (HFHSu) was obtained by submitting Wistar rats to 14 weeks of 60% lipid-rich diet and 35% of sucrose in drinking water. The HFHSu group was compared with an aged-matched control group. Glucose tolerance and  sensitivity were measured in conscious animals before diet administration and 14 weeks after the diet protocol. The expression of  hydroxylase (TH) and nestin were assessed by immunohistochemistry to identify type I and type II cells, respectively. TH expression was also quantified by Western blot. As expected, 14 weeks of HFHSu diet induced a decrease in  sensitivity as well as in glucose tolerance. HFHsu diet increased the number of TH-positive type I cells by 192% and decreased nestin-postive type 2 cells by 74%. This increase in type II cells observed by immunohistochemistry correlates with an increase by 107% in TH expression quantified by Western blot. These results suggest that changes in CB morphology are associated with metabolic disturbances invoked by administration of a hypercaloric diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31024205>Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Etiology and Current and Future Drugs.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is swiftly increasing in prevalence globally with a high mortality rate. The progression of HCC in patients is induced with advanced fibrosis, mainly cirrhosis, and hepatitis. The absence of proper preventive or curative treatment methods encouraged extensive research against HCC to develop new therapeutic strategies. The Food and Drug Administration-approved Nexavar (sorafenib) is used in the treatment of patients with unresectable HCC. In 2017, Stivarga (regorafenib) and Opdivo (nivolumab) got approved for patients with HCC after being treated with sorafenib, and in 2018, Lenvima (lenvatinib) got approved for patients with unresectable HCC. But, owing to the rapid drug  development and toxicities, these treatment options are not completely satisfactory. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new systemic combination therapies that target different signaling mechanisms, thereby decreasing the prospect of cancer cells developing  to treatment. In this review, HCC etiology and new therapeutic strategies that include currently approved drugs and other potential candidates of HCC such as Milciclib, palbociclib, galunisertib, ipafricept, and ramucirumab are evaluated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30782598>A Receptor  Kinase Network Regulates Neuromuscular Function in Response to Oxidative Stress in .</a></h2><p>The transcription factor Nrf2 plays a critical role in the organism-wide regulation of the antioxidant stress response. The Nrf2 homolog SKN-1 functions in the intestinal cells nonautonomously to negatively regulate neuromuscular junction (NMJ) function in  To identify additional molecules that mediate SKN-1 signaling to the NMJ, we performed a candidate screen for suppressors of aldicarb  caused by acute treatment with the SKN-1 activator arsenite. We identified two receptor  kinases, EGL-15 (fibroblast growth factor receptor, FGFR) and DAF-2 (-like peptide receptor), that are required for NMJ regulation in response to stress. Through double-mutant analysis, we found that EGL-15 functions downstream of, or parallel to, SKN-1 and SPHK-1 (sphingosine kinase), and that the EGL-15 ligand EGL-17 FGF and canonical EGL-15 effectors are required for oxidative stress-mediated regulation of NMJ function. DAF-2 also functions downstream of or parallel to SKN-1 to regulate NMJ function. Through tissue-specific rescue experiments, we found that FGFR signaling functions primarily in the hypodermis, whereas -like peptide receptor signaling is required in multiple tissues. Our results support the idea that the regulation of NMJ function by SKN-1 occurs via a complex organism-wide signaling network involving receptor  kinase signaling in multiple tissues.Copyright © 2019 by the Genetics Society of America.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968766>2,4-Thiazolidinediones as PTP 1B Inhibitors: A Mini Review (2012-2018).</a></h2><p>2,4-thiazolidinedione (TZD) scaffold is a synthetic versatile scaffold explored by medicinal chemists for the discovery of novel molecules for the target-specific approach to treat or manage number of deadly ailments.

The present review focused on the seven years journey (2012-2018) of TZDs as PTP 1B inhibitors with the insight into the amendments in the structural framework of TZD scaffold in order to optimize/design potential PTP 1B inhibitors. We have investigated the synthesized molecules based on TZD scaffold with potential activity profile against PTP 1B. Based on the SAR studies, the combined essential pharmacophoric features of selective and potent TZDs have been mapped and presented herewith for further design and synthesis of novel inhibitors of PTP 1B. Compound 46 bearing TZD scaffold with N-methyl benzoic acid and 5-(3-methoxy-4-phenethoxy) benzylidene exhibited the most potent activity (IC50 1.1 µM).
