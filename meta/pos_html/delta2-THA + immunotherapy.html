Conventional subcutaneous  (SCIT) and sublingual  (SLIT) cannot meet patients' needs owing to the side effects caused by both the use of conventional whole antigen molecules in the pollen extract and the administration routes. To address these issues, a surface-modified antigen and transcutaneous administration route are introduced in this research. First, the pollen extract (PE) was conjugated to galactomannan (PE-GM) to mask immunoglobulin E (IgE)-binding epitopes in the PE to avoid side effects. Second, as a safer alternative to SCIT and SLIT, transcutaneous  (TCIT) with a solid-in-oil (S/O) nanodispersion system carrying PE-GM was proposed. Hydrophilic PE-GM was efficiently delivered through mouse skin using S/O nanodispersions, reducing the antibody secretion and modifying the type 1 T helper (Th1)/ type 2 T helper (Th2) balance in the mouse model, thereby demonstrating the potential to alleviate Japanese cedar pollinosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661484>[Pooled Human Immunoglobulin Preparations as Immunomodulating Drugs].</a></h2><p>It is time to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the first successful attempt to develop and use a specific high-titer antitoxic serum for treating diphtheria, a deadly infectious disease. This was followed by major advances in passive  75 years ago (production of pooled human IgG for subcutaneous injection) and 50 years ago (widespread technology for producing immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous administration). More than 200 tons of pooled human IgG are produced per year worldwide. The preparation is used primarily for IgG substitution in patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, as well as for an immunomodulating treatment of a growing number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. These preparations contain the pooled IgG antibody repertoire of a large population of healthy plasma donors. This repertoire includes antibodies that neutralize pathogens and their factors of virulence, anti-idiotypic antibodies, and antibodies to other foreign and own proteins, as well as to carbohydrate antigens. Naturally polyspecific antibodies that are present in all healthy individuals play an important role as a first-line defense against bacteria and viruses. After exposure to protein-modifying agents, some IgG molecules can acquire the ability to bind novel structurally unrelated antigens. This phenomenon is referred to as induced polyspecificity. The list of these protein-modifying molecules was shown to include low-pH buffers, free heme, pro-oxidative ferrous ions, reactive oxygen species, etc. Such modified antibody preparations may have a therapeutic potential, since their administration to animals with experimental sepsis or aseptic systemic response syndromes significantly improved survival rates, while the same dose of the native preparation had no effect. We also hypothesize that the aggressive protein-modifying molecules released in sites of inflammation and tissue damage could also modify the antigen-binding behavior of surface immunoglobulin B cell receptors and the structurally related T cell receptors. This "specificity editing" of both types of receptors may play a major role in the body's defense mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659324>The impact of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay on genetic disease, gene editing and cancer .</a></h2><p>Premature termination codons (PTCs) can result in the production of truncated proteins or the degradation of messenger RNAs by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Which of these outcomes occurs can alter the effect of a mutation, with the engagement of NMD being dependent on a series of rules. Here, by applying these rules genome-wide to obtain a resource called NMDetective, we explore the impact of NMD on genetic disease and approaches to therapy. First, human genetic diseases differ in whether NMD typically aggravates or alleviates the effects of PTCs. Second, failure to trigger NMD is a cause of ineffective gene inactivation by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. Finally, NMD is a determinant of the efficacy of cancer , with only frameshifted transcripts that escape NMD predicting a response. These results demonstrate the importance of incorporating the rules of NMD into clinical decision-making. Moreover, they suggest that inhibiting NMD may be effective in enhancing cancer .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673526>Management of local recurrences and regional failure in early stage non-small cell lung cancer after stereotactic body radiation therapy.</a></h2><p>Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a very effective way to treat early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small oligometastatic lung lesions with consistently high rates of local control, but both local and regional/distant recurrences still occur. The management of recurrences remains unsettled and may entail repeat SBRT, conventionally fractionated external beam RT (EF-EBRT), chemotherapy or surgery. Most patients with local recurrences [within the initial planning target volume (PTV)] can be salvaged successfully with good cancer specific survival. Nonetheless, proximity of the initial SBRT delivery to organs at risk (ribs, blood vessels, airways) may make retreatment more difficult. With attention to detail and careful patient selection, both surgery and reirradiation can be performed safely and effectively. Strategies for management of regional (nodal) recurrences may require conventional therapies tailored to the patterns of failure. The role of  in salvage has not been elucidated as yet.

We performed capture-based targeted sequencing on tissue samples collected from 27 patients with sufficient samples using a panel consisting of 520 cancer-related genes, spanning 1.64 Mb of the human genome. We identified 184 somatic mutations in 109 genes from 26 patients. One patient had no mutations detected by this panel. Copy number variations were detected in 52% (14/27) of the patients, with a majority having advanced-stage disease (10/14). Except for the detection of ERBB2 amplification and KRAS mutation in two patients, no other classic lung cancer driver mutations were detected. Interestingly, 78% (21/27) of the patients had mutations in epigenetic regulators. Of the 184 mutations identified, 51 occurred in 29 epigenetics-related genes. Furthermore, we performed PD-L1 immunohistochemistry staining using the Dako 22C3 assay and demonstrated that 69% (20/29) of the cohort had positive PD-L1 expression, of which three patients received and benefited from a PD-1 inhibitor. In conclusion, we elucidated a distinct genomic landscape associated with pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma with no classic lung cancer driver mutation but an enrichment of mutations in epigenetic regulators.

Grading systems for pathologic response were first developed for chemotherapy in select tumor types. Immunotherapeutic agents have a mechanism of action distinct from chemotherapy and are being used across a broad array of tumor types. A standardized, universal scoring system for pathologic response that encompasses features characteristic for  and spans tumor types is needed.Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from neoadjuvant surgical resections and on-treatment biopsies were assessed for features of immune-related pathologic response (irPR). 258 specimens from patients with 11 tumor types as part of ongoing clinical trials for anti-PD-1 were evaluated. An additional 98 specimens from patients receiving anti-PD-(L)1 in combination with other treatments were also reviewed, including those from three additional tumor types.Common irPR features (immune activation, cell death, tissue repair, regression bed) were present in all tumor types reviewed, including melanoma, non-small cell lung, head and neck squamous cell, Merkel cell, and renal cell carcinoma, amongst others. Features were consistent across primary tumors, lymph nodes, and distant metastases. Specimens from patients treated with anti-PD-(L)1 in combination with another agent also exhibited irPR features.irPR features are consistent across tumor types and treatment settings.

Although cancer cells contain supra-normal concentrations of cytoplasmic DNA, they rarely produce type I IFN spontaneously. This suggests that defects in the DNA-sensing pathway may serve as an immune escape mechanism. We find that cancer cells produce cGAMP that is transferred via gap junctions to tumor-associated dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, which respond by producing type I IFN in situ. Cancer-cell-intrinsic expression of cGAS, but not STING, promotes infiltration by effector CD8 T cells and consequently results in prolonged survival. Furthermore, cGAS-expressing cancers respond better to genotoxic treatments and . Thus, cancer-cell-derived cGAMP is crucial to protective anti-tumor CD8 T cell immunity. Consequently, cancer-cell-intrinsic expression of cGAS determines tumor immunogenicity and makes tumors hot.

Donor-specific antibodies (DSA) are putatively associated with a worse prognosis for recipient and graft after liver transplantation.To assess the immune regulation in subTCMR grafts, gene expression of 93 transcripts for graft injury, tolerance and immune regulation was analyzed in 77 biopsies with "no histological rejection" (NHR; n=25), "clinical TCMR" (cTMCR; n=16) and subTCMR (n=36). In addition, all available subTCMR biopsies (n=71) were tested for DSA with bead assays.SubTCMR showed heterogeneous and intermediate expression profiles of transcripts that were upregulated in cTCMR. Graft gene expression suggested a lower activation of effector lymphocytes and a higher activation of regulatory T cells in grafts with subTCMR compared to cTCMR.DSA positivity in subTCMR was associated with histological evidence of more severe graft inflammation and fibrosis. This more severe DSA+ associated graft injury in subTCMR was converged with an upregulation of cTCMR associated transcripts. In nonsupervised analysis DSA positive subTCMR mostly clustered together with cTCMR, while DSA negative subTCMR clustered together with NHR.T cell-mediated rejection seem to form a continuum of alloimmune activation. Although subTCMR exhibited less expression of TCMR associated transcript, DSA positivity in subTCMR was associated with an upregulation of rejection associated transcripts.

NLRP3 inflammasome provides a first-line defense in viral infections, and, accordingly, gain-of-function variants in NLRP3 have been associated with protection against HIV-1. Despite antiretroviral treatment (ART), HIV+ patients continue to present systemic inflammation with a heterogeneous prognosis. As NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in several chronic diseases by amplifying "sterile" inflammation, its role in chronic phase of HIV infection has been postulated. Little is known about inflammasome genetics in HIV+ patients and whether it may play a role in the different clinical outcomes. Therefore, we questioned whether NLRP3 inflammasome genetics could affect the clinical course of HIV-1 infection as it does in host/virus interaction. For this purpose, we analyzed selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ART-treated HIV+ patients (n = 300), in Long Term Non-Progressors/Elite Controllers and progressors (n = 133), and in HIV+ individuals submitted to dendritic cell (DC)-based  (n = 19). SNPs leading to increased activation of NLRP3 inflammasome are beneficial for patients, while SNPs that negatively affect NLRP3 activation or IL-18 production, detrimental. In contrast, gain-of-function variant in IL1B is also detrimental for patients, suggesting that while IL-1ß possible contributes to immune exhaustion, the axis NLRP3-inflammasome/IL-18 could act positively in chronic infection. Functional assays supported genetic results: NLRP3 variants associated with good quality HIV+ DC, and IL1B -511C > T with a poor one. Loss-of-function SNPs affect HIV+ T cells proliferation. These findings proposed for the first time that NLRP3 inflammasome, mainly through IL-18, play a protective role in chronic HIV infection.Copyright © 2018.

MAPC were co-cultured with phenytoin and celecoxib at relevant clinical concentrations for 1 h and 24 h. Anti-inflammatory potency was tested using a stimulated rat splenocyte co-culture and ELISA for TNF-α production. MAPC were cultured under different osmolar concentrations and stained with propidium iodide for viability. Anti-inflammatory potency was tested by co-culture of MAPC with naïve lymphocytes activated by CD3/CD28 beads, and Click-iT® Plus EdU was used to quantify proliferation by flow cytometry.The mean viability of the MAPC infused via needles was 95 ± 1%; no difference was seen with varying flow rate, but viability was notably reduced by chlorhexidine. MAPC function was not impaired by co-culture with phenytoin, celecoxib, or combination with both. Co-culture with phenytoin showed a decrease in TNF-α production as compared to the MAPC control. MAPC cultured at varying osmolar concentrations all had viabilities greater than 90% with no statistical difference between them. Co-culture of MAPC with CD3/CD28 activated PBMCs showed a significant reduction in proliferation as measured by EdU uptake.Needle diameter, phenytoin, celecoxib, and a relevant range of osmolarities do not impair MAPC viability or anti-inflammatory potency .© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668277>Testing Immune-Related Adverse Events in Cancer .</a></h2><p>Immune-targeted therapeutics are being used in cancer. Immune "checkpoint inhibition" provides promise for prolonged disease-free patient survival. Use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer has coincided with the onset of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). irAEs are caused by a break in host self-tolerance, which can be deadly. Acute management of irAEs is complicated by difficulty making a prompt clinical diagnosis. The goal is to maximize anticancer benefit while minimizing irAE risk. We currently lack diagnostic tools to assess pretreatment irAE risk and facilitate diagnosis. Current immunologic understanding of irAEs is discussed with an emphasis on how patients with congenital syndromes of T-cell activation may inform this understanding. The prospects of improving diagnostics for and treatment of irAEs are discussed.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A recent phase II study in advanced cervical cancer has demonstrated a disease control rate of 68.4% with the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab. By blocking immune checkpoints,  puts the immune system into a state of hyper-activation that can cause immune-related adverse events. We present the clinical, pathological and molecular data of a patient with metastatic cervical cancer and progressive disease after second-line therapy. We report on the therapeutic response under third-line  with nivolumab, the immune-related adverse events (IRAE), and their successful management.We report the case of a 62-year-old woman who was diagnosed with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with paraaortic lymph node metastases. After an initial combined radio-chemotherapy with cisplatin, she developed local and nodal (supraclavicular) recurrence. Second-line chemotherapy with 6 cycles of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab resulted in a partial response for 6 months. Checkpoint inhibition with nivolumab was started due to progression, leading to persistent complete remission.  was well tolerated for 8 months until the patient presented with an immune-related isolated vulvitis, which was successfully managed with topical corticosteroids.The persistent complete response after third-line treatment for relapsed chemotherapy-resistant cervical cancer presented in this case highlights the potential of  for patients with advanced cervical cancer impressively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an isolated immune-related vulvitis under nivolumab. This adverse event might be underdiagnosed and mistreated, however, it is of importance due to its impact on quality of life, sexual wellbeing and compliance of patients. Successful IRAE management may enable prolonged immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. In the future, routine molecular tumour profiling is likely to aid in the stratification of cervical cancer patients for .

About 90% of all renal cancers are Renal Cell Carcinoma. Most cases are diagnosed incidentally. 17% of cases are advanced at the time of diagnosis. PDL1 being a trans-membrane cell surface protein is expressed on the tumor cells and is found to have a chief role to inhibit the T cell immune response. It is essential to improve the host immunity by targeting the PD1/PDL1 pathway, thereby destroying the tumor progression.The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of PDL1 in tumor cells and adjacent normal tissue among the renal cell carcinoma patients and assess the relation between the PDL1 expression and the tumor characters.This is a retrospective study. Ethical clearance was obtained from the institution. 150 histopathologically proven RCC cases were chosen. Immunohistochemistry using a PD-L1 rabbit monoclonal antibody was performed on paraffin embedded formalin fixed tissue blocks. Q scoring was done to calculate the expression of PDL1.Chi square test was done to assess the comparison between the PDL1 expression in tumor cells and their characteristic features like histology, grade and stage. SPSS (version 20.0) was used for analysis. P value <0.05 was considered significant. It also explains the heterogenous nature of PDL1 as it expressed more in the aggressive pathologic characters like high grade.Positive PD-L1 expression was seen in 44% of tumors. Significant association was observed between high WWHO ISUP grading and positive PDL1 expression (p=0.028). It was expressed in 75% of the sarcomatous type of RCC and 46.8% of clear cell RCCs.Our study suggests that blocking PD1/PDL1 pathway may become an effective mode of treatment in cancer  especially for Renal Cell Carcinomas. Our findings confirmed the significant association between expression of PDL1 and the high graded tumors which proves it to be an important prognostic factor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664934>Severe colitis after PD-1 blockade with nivolumab in advanced melanoma patients: potential role of Th1-dominant immune response in immune-related adverse events: two case reports.</a></h2><p>Nivolumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor specific to the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor. Nivolumab has shown clinical responses in many malignancies. Although immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with nivolumab are largely tolerable, severe irAEs have occurred in some patients. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of irAEs are not fully clarified.We report 2 patients with metastatic melanoma who developed colitis, an irAEs caused by nivolumab. Both patients experienced colitis after nivolumab administration. Pathological examination of the colon showed robust infiltration of CD8 cells and T-bet expressing CD4 cells in both cases, indicating helper T cells (Th) 1 to be responsible for the dominant response. Additionally, we observed the serum C-reactive protein level (CRP) as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) reflected the clinical course of irAEs clearly in the two cases.Our two cases suggested that the development of irAEs due to nivolumab is associated with Th1 dominant response. CRP as well as IL-6 was found to be a potential biomarker for irAEs. Our findings may help to understand the mechanisms underlying irAEs caused by nivolumab and manage irAEs in clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673520>What is the role of radiotherapy for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer in the  era?</a></h2><p>Small cell lung cancer has been a difficult disease to treat with poor survival and few significant improvements in outcomes in the last three decades. Most recently the addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) resulted in improved overall survival and progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy alone. Recent randomized studies examining both consolidative thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in ES-SCLC have impacted the utilization of these interventions. The approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to platinum/etoposide chemotherapy for the treatment of ES-SCLC in the front-line setting may also further impact the role of radiotherapy in this disease. In this article, we review the current evidence supporting thoracic radiotherapy in ES-SCLC and discuss the promising therapeutic implications of thoracic radiation in light of the inclusion of ICIs. We also address how the increasing routine use of surveillance brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ICIs may diminish the use of PCI in ES-SCLC.2019 Translational Lung Cancer Research.

Functional TCR subunit genes are formed by somatic rearrangement, and some of the resulting TCRs recognize autoantigens, the body's own molecules. The autoreactive T cells that carry such TCRs pose a threat of inducing immune reactions against their own organism. In the course of the immune system's development, some autoreactive T lymphocytes are eliminated by apoptosis, some differentiate into immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, which support immunological tolerance to autoantigens, and the rest fall into a non-functional state of anergy. Suppression of effector T cells by regulatory T cells is mediated by immunosuppressive cytokines and costimulatory molecules, depletion of stimulating IL-2, removal of autoreactive peptides together with MHC molecules, and in other ways. Impairment of self-tolerance leads to autoimmune diseases. However, the loss of immunological tolerance can be employed in tumor treatment, allowing  and the use of the potential of autoreactive effector T cells. The fact that the efficacious  of tumors is often accompanied by adverse autoimmune reactions currently seems to be the inevitable price paid by using this approach.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656561>-related hepatitis: real-world experience from a tertiary centre.</a></h2><p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors like anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) drugs Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated (CTLA-4) drug Ipilimumab have become standard of care in many metastatic cancers. -related hepatitis and cholangitis present a diagnostic and management challenge, being rare and incompletely characterised. We aim to report the incidence, features and treatments used for this in a real-world setting and to identify useful biomarkers, which can be used to predict effective use of steroids.Retrospective review of 453 patients started on  over 7 years.Tertiary hepatology and oncology centre.21 patients identified with -related hepatotoxicity.Hepatitis was most common in those receiving dual therapy (incidence 20%), with 75% of Grade 4 hepatitis cases occurring with ipilimumab-containing regimens. Corticosteroid monotherapy is first line treatment, but doses above 60 mg OD prednisolone do not demonstrate any additional benefit in time to hepatitis resolution. The alanine transaminase (ALT) reduction in steroid-responsive hepatitis is typically rapid (with a halving of ALT within 11 days). The commencement of additional immunosuppression (typically mycophenolate) appears safe and prompts a more rapid fall in ALT than corticosteroid use alone. Infliximab was safely used twice as hepatitis treatment. We also describe one patient with rare -induced biliary disease.Vigilance is required for detection of -associated liver disease as, other than dual , we can identify no predictive factors for its development. Our data suggest that corticosteroid response is not dependent on the higher dosing regimens. Early escalation of immunosuppression may be of benefit in the absence of a rapid response to corticosteroids.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

Within this chapter, we have attempted to gather all key considerations during preclinical animal trials.Guidance is provided for choices on animal models, options for immunosuppression, as well as anesthesia. Subsequently we cover surgical strategies for RPE graft delivery, both as suspension as well as in monolayers in small rodents, rabbits, pigs, and nonhuman primate. A detailed account is given in particular on animal variations in vitrectomy and subretinal surgery, which requires a considerable learning curve, when transiting from human to animal. In turn, however, many essential subretinal implantation techniques in large-eyed animals are directly transferrable to human clinical trial protocols.A dedicated subchapter on photoreceptor replacement provides insights on preparation of suspension as well as sheet grafts, to subsequently outline the basics of subretinal delivery via both the transscleral and transvitreal route.

We assessed correlation between HCV-cAg and HCV RNA in serum samples with low viral loads and analyzed the performance of HCV-cAg assay in determining diagnosis and treatment outcomes in chronic hepatitis C patients. Both HCV RNA and HCV-cAg were detected for 2298 serum samples. Correlation analysis was performed between the two tests. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to assess value of HCV-cAg test in determining diagnosis and response outcomes at the different HCV RNA thresholds. The two tests were correlated very well, and moreover, correlation in the low viral load group was higher than that in the high viral load group (r value: 0.901 and 0.517). Positive agreement of HCV-cAg ≥ 3 fmol/L was as high as 97.0% for HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL, and its negative agreement for HCV RNA < 15 IU/mL was up to 98.9% in all samples. Area under ROCs ranged from 0.939 to 0.992, regardless of HCV RNA thresholds. When lower limit of detection of HCV RNA was 15, 100 or 1000 IU/mL, positive predictive value of HCV-cAg was 96.8%, 98.8% or 92.4%, and its negative predictive value was 87.0%, 89.9% or 98.3%, respectively, on the basis of different cutoff values. High-sensitivity HCV-cAg detection may likely replace HCV RNA to confirm the existence of HCV and to guide the treatment of chronic HCV infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659849>Chemical Antibody Mimics Inhibit Cadherin-Mediated Cell-Cell Adhesion: A Promising Strategy for Cancer Therapy.</a></h2><p>One of the most promising strategies to treat cancer, entails the use of therapeutic antibodies which disrupt cell-cell adhesion mediated by dysregulated cadherins. The principal site where cell-cell adhesion occurs, encompasses a Trp2 found at the N-terminal region of the protein. Herein, we employed the naturally exposed highly conserved peptide Asp1-Trp2-Val3-Ile4-Pro5-Pro6-Ile7, as epitope to prepare synthetic antibodies based on molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticles (MIP-NPs), to recognize cadherins. Since these highly selective 47 nm-sized particles target exactly the site responsible for adhesion, they were more potent than commercially available therapeutic antibodies, for inhibiting cell-cell adhesion in cell aggregation assays, and for completely disrupting three-dimensional tumor spheroids as well as inhibiting invasion of human cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells. These biocompatible and cost-effective supramolecular anti-adhesives which can be used as both immunotherapeutic and sensitizing agents contribute to the establishment of a novel therapeutic platform in cancer treatment.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Increasing antibiotic resistance has severely limited treatment options. A mechanism that Neisseria gonorrhoeae uses to evade complement attack is binding of the complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein (C4BP). We screened 107 PorB1a and 83 PorB1b clinical isolates randomly selected from a Swedish strain collection over the last 10 years and noted that 96/107 (89.7%) PorB1a and 16/83 (19.3%) PorB1b bound C4BP; C4BP binding significantly correlated with the ability to evade complement-dependent killing (r = 0.78; p<0.0001). We designed two chimeric proteins that fused C4BP domains to the backbone of immunoglobulins IgG or IgM (C4BP-IgG; C4BP-IgM) with the aim of enhancing complement activation and killing of gonococci. Both proteins bound gonococci (Kd C4BP-IgM = 2.4 nM; Kd C4BP-IgG 981 nM), but only hexameric C4BP-IgM efficiently out-competed heptameric C4BP from bacterial surface resulting in enhanced complement deposition and bacterial killing. Furthermore, C4BP-IgM significantly attenuated the duration and burden of colonization of two C4BP-binding gonococcal isolates, but not a C4BP non-binding strain in the mouse vaginal colonization model using human factor H/C4BP transgenic mice.

Given that it is a condition with neuropsychiatric symptoms, its initial symptom is frequently psychiatric in nature. Hence, psychiatrists are often the first physicians to assess these patients and, as so, must recognize this type of encephalitis as a possible cause. Catatonia may be inaugural or develop throughout the course of the disease. Management of patients with anti-NMDAr encephalitis is based on etiologic treatment with  and removal of the associated tumor, if any. However, these catatonic patients may have variable responses to etiologic treatment, sometimes with refractory catatonic symptoms, which attests to the necessary urgency to know how to manage these patients. In the clinical setting, physicians appear to be using guidelines originally created to the management of catatonia due to primary psychiatric conditions. In this literature review, catatonia was historically contextualized and anti-NMDAr encephalitis overall described. Finally, catatonia secondary to this type of encephalitis was discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669829>Analysis of different signal peptides for the secretory production of Ama r 2 in gram-positive systems (Lactococcus lactis).</a></h2><p>Prokaryotic systems have been considered the most affordable and simplest hosts which are being employed to express recombinant proteins such as allergens; nevertheless, without appropriate signal peptide (SP), these systems cannot be used for secretory proteins. Recently, a lot of effort has been put into assessing the potential of gram-positive strains such as lactic acid bacteria for new applications in the production of heterologous proteins. Ama r 2 is a respiratory allergen from Amaranthus retroflexus, whose recombinant production in the probiotic host could be introduced as a specific and effective way to rapid diagnosis and  of this allergy. Consequently, the production of this recombinant protein using the prokaryotic system, requires a suitable SP to protect disulfide bonds and to prevent misfolding. This study was designed to predict the best SPs for the expression of Ama r 2 protein in Lactococcus lactis as the host. In this study, 42 signal sequences were selected from SP databases and the most important features of them were evaluated. First, n, h and c regions of the SPs and their probabilities were investigated by signalP software version 4.1. Then, their physicochemical properties were evaluated by Portparam and SOLpro. Moreover, the secretion sorting and sub-cellular localization sites were evaluated by PRED-TAT and ProtcompB software programs. The results revealed that yjgB, entC2 (Entrotoxine type C-2), ent B (Entrotoxine type), blaZ (Beta lactamase), dex (number 21), blm (Beta lactamase 2) dex (Dextranase; number 20) and number 26 were introduced theatrically as the best SPs to express Ama r 2 in Lactococcus lactis.Copyright © 2019.

These small vesicles are considered to be novel cross-talk circuits established by tumor cells and tumor microenvironment. Previous studies have shown certain biological influence of exosomal programmed cell-death ligand 1 (Exo-PD-L1) on immune suppression and dysfunction. The aim of the current study was to investigate the impact of Exo-PD-L1 and soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and explore the concordance between Exo-PD-L1 and PD-L1 expression in matched tumor tissues in NSCLC patients.85 consecutive patients from April 2017 to December 2017 at General Hospital of Eastern Command Theatre who were primarily diagnosed with NSCLC and 27 healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. Two milliliters of whole blood samples were collected from each participant and further centrifuged. Exosomes were derived from serum using the commercial kit (Total Exosome Isolation Kit), which was further identified by Western blotting analysis (CD63/TSG101), transmission electron microscope analysis (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Exosomes were next solubilized for Exo-PD-L1 detection by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). PD-L1 expression in matched tissue were assessed by PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) (clone 28-8) assay. Tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥ 1% was deemed as "positive" in this study and TPS < 1% was deemed as "negative". Written informed consent were obtained before acquisition of all data and biological sample. Data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 and Graphpad Prism 5 software. Chi square test was conducted to estimate the correlation between Exo-PD-L1 levels, sPD-L1 levels, PD-L1 IHC profiles and clinicopathological features. For all analysis, a two-sided p < 0.05 was considered significant statistically.Exo-PD-L1 levels were higher in NSCLC patients with advanced tumor stage, larger tumor size (> 2.5 cm) (p < 0.001), positive lymph node status (p < 0.05) and distant metastasis (p < 0.05). In contrast, sPD-L1 levels were not different between NSCLC patients and healthy donors, it was not correlated with any clinicopathologic features except for tumor size (> 2.5 cm) (p < 0.05). In addition, Exo-PD-L1 levels showed slight correlation with sPD-L1 levels (Spearman's correlation at r = 0.3, p = 0.0027) while no correlation with PD-L1 IHC profiles was detected.In conclusion, Exo-PD-L1, but not sPD-L1, was correlated with NSCLC disease progression, including tumor size, lymph node status, metastasis and TNM stage.

However, immune checkpoint blockade is still suboptimal in HCC treatment and more immune modifications are needed to achieve an efficient therapeutic goal. Here, we investigated the combined administration of a Listeria-based HCC vaccine, Lmdd-MPFG, and the anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade antibody. We found that Lmdd-MPFG promoted the expression of PD-L1 in HCC cells but resensitized the tumor local T cell to respond to the anti-PD-1 . Mechanistically, the Lmdd-MPFG vaccine activates the NF-κB pathway in the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) through the TLR2 and MyD88 pathway, and recruits p62 to activate the autophagy pathway. The overall effect is skewing the TAMs from M2-polarized TAMs into the M1-polarized TAMs. Most importantly, it skewed the cytokine profiles into antitumor one in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This change restores the T-cell reactivity to the anti-PD-1 blockade. Our results suggested that Lmdd-MPFG combined with PD-1 blockade exerted synergistic antitumor effects through modifying TAMs in the TME and removing T-cell inhibitory signals, thereby providing a new potential strategy for HCC treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673481>The efficacy and safety of combination of PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors: a meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Recently, a series of clinical trials showed that combination of anti-programmed cell death-1 (α-PD-1) and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (α-CTLA-4) could effectively eliminate tumor. However, in comparison with widely adopted mono-immune checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy, the advantage of combination therapy of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 in response rate and prognosis is controversial especially considering probably increased treatment related adverse event. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to explore the efficacy and safety of combination treatment of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4.This meta-analysis involved 8 clinical trials. In most trials, the primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Thus we calculated risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare ORR of patients undergoing different treatment strategies. Moreover, the co-primary endpoints in few trials included progression-free survival and overall survival. Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI were employed to weigh the influence of different treatments on prognosis of patients. Subgroup analysis was conducted in patients with high and low expression of PD-L1. Lastly, the safety of combination therapy was evaluated by comparing treatment related adverse events among various treatment groups.Our results showed that ORR was significantly higher in patients receiving α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 compared with α-PD-1 (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16-1.48) or α-CTLA-4 monotherapy (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.84-2.43), chemotherapy and targeted therapy (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.26-1.58). α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 treated patients had a great advantage on monotherapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy treated patients in PFS. Notably, no significant alteration in total adverse event rate was observed in α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 treated patients. Results of subgroup analysis showed that combination therapy could enhance anti-tumor response in comparison with other treatments, especially for low PD-L1 expression patients undergoing nivolumab treatment (ORR: RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.11-1.65).Combination treatment of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 is a feasible strategy with enhanced efficacy and acceptable adverse event. Moreover, for some low PD-L1 expression patients, α-CTLA-4 might decrease the risk of resistance to α-PD-1 and demonstrate the synergistic anti-tumor effect.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653037>Multimerization through Pegylation Improves Pharmacokinetic Properties of scFv Fragments of GD2-Specific Antibodies.</a></h2><p>Antigen-binding fragments of antibodies specific to the tumor-associated ganglioside GD2 are well poised to play a substantial role in modern GD2-targeted cancer therapies, however, rapid elimination from the body and reduced affinity compared to full-length antibodies limit their therapeutic potential. In this study, scFv fragments of GD2-specific antibodies 14.18 were produced in a mammalian expression system that specifically bind to ganglioside GD2, followed by site-directed pegylation to generate mono-, di-, and tetra-scFv fragments. Fractionated pegylated dimers and tetramers of scFv fragments showed significant increase of the binding to GD2 which was not accompanied by cross-reactivity with other gangliosides. Pegylated multimeric di-scFvs and tetra-scFvs exhibited cytotoxic effects in GD2-positive tumor cells, while their circulation time in blood significantly increased compared with monomeric antibody fragments. We also demonstrated a more efficient tumor uptake of the multimers in a syngeneic GD2-positive mouse cancer model. The findings of this study provide the rationale for improving therapeutic characteristics of GD2-specific antibody fragments by multimerization and propose a strategy to generate such molecules.

Therefore, the MYB protein is an ideal target to vaccinate against to aid recruitment of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) against these tumours. The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (Melbourne, Australia) has engineered a DNA vaccine, TetMYB, based on the pVAX1 plasmid vector carrying a fusion construct consisting of the universal tetanus toxin T-cell epitopes flanking an inactivated  gene.This prospective first-in-human phase I single-arm multi-centre clinical trial involves patients with metastatic CRC or AdCC. Stage 1 will evaluate the safety profile of escalating doses of TetMYB vaccine, given sequentially and in combination with an anti-PD-1 inhibitory antibody, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Stage 2 will assess the MTD in an expanded cohort. The calculated sample size is 32 patients: 12 in Stage 1 and 20 in Stage 2.

Even when response is obtained, regrowth of the tumors is almost inevitable. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of helical tomotherapy for chemo-refractory multiple liver metastases.Forty-five patients with chemo-refractory multiple (3-10) liver metastases after standard systemic chemotherapy entered the single-institutional prospective study. Liver metastases were the major disease; however, 31 also had uncontrolled primary lesions and/or other metastases. The prescribed dose was 55 Gy in 25 fractions. The median planning target volume (PTV) and normal liver volume (NLV) of first treatment were 128 cm and 1175 cm , respectively. The median of V , V , and mean dose to NLV were 45%, 23%, and 19.4 Gy, respectively.Forty-two patients (93%) completed the planned treatment. Median survival time (MST) for all patients was 8 months, and the 1-year survival rate was 29%. The median local control (LC) period was 5 months and the 6-month control rate of irradiated tumors was 33%. A ≥30% decrease in tumor markers was observed in 31%. The most common grade 3 toxicity was lymphocytopenia (40%), followed by fatigue (6%). Radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) was not observed. Pancreatic cancer as the primary tumor, distant metastases outside the liver, low pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and low pretreatment monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) were associated with poorer prognoses.Helical tomotherapy for chemo-refractory multiple liver metastases is a feasible and potentially effective treatment. Incorporating tomotherapy into the first-line treatment in combination with systemic chemotherapy should be considered.CROG 12005.© 2019 The Authors.

However, limited progress with Tim-3  has been achieved over the last decade due to the lack of specific Tim-3 monoclonal antibodies. In this study, we have successfully developed a unique set of Tim-3 antibodies that are able to detect different molecular weights (by Western blot mobility) of Tim-3 proteins ectopically expressed in the same CHO cells. Some of the antibody clones detect only 33 or 55 kDa bands, the rest can recognize both 33 and 55 kDa bands on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. Antibody clones with 55 kDa specificity uniquely bind to the membrane form of Tim-3 on macrophage, which colocalizes with the CD68, and could be used as a specific marker for tumor-associated macrophage, whereas other clones showed cytoplasmic staining in tumor cells. The membrane form of Tim-3 on tumor-associated macrophages may bear significant roles for clinical application of Tim-3, but less likely for cytoplasmic one. The availability of this unique set of antibodies will be critical for an ultimate understanding of Tim-3 function in tumor microenvironment and potential clinical applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668880>Peptides of tetraspanin oncoprotein CD151 trigger active immunity against primary tumour and experimental lung metastasis.</a></h2><p>Active  is an effective, long-lasting, cheap, and safe approach to suppress cancer progression; however, the key issue is to develop appropriate tumour vaccines. Oncoproteins are up-regulated under various stress conditions and promote cell survival. Oncoproteins and their immunogenic domains could serve well as tumour vaccines and prime the hosts' active anti-tumour immunity.Proteomic and bioinformatic analyses were performed to identify potential tumour associated antigens (TAAs). Then, peptides derived from CD151 were designed and synthesized according to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I binding and immunogenicity. Cytotoxicity assay, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and in vivo bioluminescence imaging were performed to assess the active anti-tumour immunity triggered by CD151 peptides in H22 primary hepatoma and experimental 4T1 breast cancer lung metastasis models.CD151 was identified as an ideal TAA based on proteomic and bioinformatic analyses. CD151 peptides as tumour vaccines triggered active anti-tumour immunity against H22 hepatoma and the lung metastasis of 4T1 breast cancer in two mouse models through the activation of CD8IFNγ lymphocytes and the subsequent targeted cytotoxicity. Further, the peptides suppressed the negative regulators, myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Survival was prolonged for mice with lung metastases from CD151 peptide-immunised groups.The up-regulated oncoproteins in 8 Gy-irradiated tumour cells are good candidates for designing immunogenic peptides as tumour vaccines. Anti-tumour active immunity primed by peptides from CD151 may be an effective and safe approach to suppress cancer progression.Copyright © 2019.

Targeting an appropriate B cell epitope in pathological tau could in theory produce an effective reduction of pathology without disrupting the function of normal native tau. Recent data demonstrate that the N-terminal region of tau (aa 2-18), termed the "phosphatase activation domain (PAD)", is hidden within native Tau in a 'paperclip'-like conformation. Conversely, PAD is exposed in pathological tau and plays an essential role in the inhibition of fast axonal transport and tau polymerization. Thus, we hypothesized that anti-tau2-18 antibodies may safely and specifically reduce pathological tau and prevent further aggregation, which in turn would neutralize tau toxicity. Therefore, we evaluated the immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy of our MultiTEP platform-based vaccine targeting tau2-18 formulated with Advax adjuvant (AV-1980R/A) in PS19 tau transgenic mice. The AV-1980R/A induced extremely high antibody responses and the resulting sera recognized neurofibrillary tangles and plaque-associated dystrophic neurites in AD brain sections. In addition, under non-denaturing conditions AV-1980R/A sera preferentially recognized AD-associated tau. Importantly, vaccination also prevented age-related motor and cognitive deficits in PS19 mice and significantly reduced insoluble total and phosphorylated tau species. Taken together, these findings suggest that predominantly targeting misfolded tau with AV-1980R/A could represent an effective strategy for AD .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653618>Pembrolizumab-associated autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.</a></h2><p>Treatment paradigms have recently changed with the introduction of ; autoimmune toxicities that can arise are frequently very different from the more familiar chemotherapy toxicities.

Prospective phase II studies have incorporated local therapy (predominantly stereotactic ablative radiotherapy or SABR) to both primary and metastatic sites. For patients who received these treatments, median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) exceeded that of historical controls treated with systemic therapy alone (9.7-23.5 and 13.5-41.2 months, respectively). Additionally, three trials randomized oligometastatic NSCLC patients to standard of care systemic therapy regimens  local consolidative therapy (LCT) plus standard of care systemic therapy (or observation) and all demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS, with two showing OS benefits to date. Notably, a majority of these trials selected patients with at least stable disease after completion of systemic therapy for local therapy and defined the oligometastatic state as one with no more than five metastatic sites spread across three organs. For patients with oligometastatic NSCLC, there are many important factors that should drive use and timing of local therapy, including metastatic presentation sequence (synchronous  metachronous), extent of disease (number and distribution of sites), and quality of life goals. The referenced clinical trials accrued patients prior to the approval of  for metastatic NSCLC, so the benefits of any local therapy in this setting remain uncertain. To ultimately clarify the role of local therapy in oligometastatic NSCLC in the era of improving systemic therapy efficacy (i.e.,  and targeted therapy combinations with cytotoxics), we recommend enrollment in in phase III studies with OS endpoints (i.e., NRG LU 002 and SARON) whenever possible.

The clinical syndromes have phenotypes which are often highly characteristic of their associated antigen-specific autoantibody. For example, the constellation of psychiatric features and the multi-faceted movement disorder observed in patients with NMDAR antibodies are highly distinctive, as are the faciobrachial dystonic seizures observed in close association with LGI1 antibodies.

Expression levels of PD-1, PD-L1, and P16 were determined by immunohistochemistry.A significantly higher proportion of PD-1 among patients infected with the human papillomavirus was found. PD-L1 expression is closely associated with the primary site of the tumor, postoperative recurrence, survival, PD-1 expression and P16 expression. Univariable analysis indicated that T stage, N stage, tumor node metastasis stage, tumor differentiation, and PD-L1 expression were all shown to be prognostic variables for overall survival in patients with HNSCC. In the multivariate analysis, only N stage ( = 0.010) and PD-L1 expression ( = 0.001) were found to be independent prognostic variables for overall survival. In addition, for disease recurrence, multivariate analysis showed that only PD-L1 expression was the associated independent risk factor. For the patients with negative PD-L1 expression, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that they had significantly worse outcomes in terms of overall survival ( = 0.001). Similarly, compared with the patients with positive PD-L1 expression, those with negative PD-L1 expression had a higher probability of recurrence ( = 0.026).The expression of PD-L1, PD-1, and P16 in HNSCC is significantly correlated. Human papillomavirus infection (P16 positive) is negatively related to postoperative recurrence.

Nonetheless, little insight exists on other immune subsets involved in the cardiotoxic response.  Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to map the cardiac immune composition in the standard murine non-ischemic, pressure-overload HF model. By focusing our analysis on CD45 cells, we obtained a higher resolution identification of the immune cell subsets in the heart, at early and late stages of disease and in controls. We then integrated our findings using multi-parameter flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and tissue clarification immunofluorescence, in mouse and human.  We found that most major immune cell subpopulations, including macrophages, B cells, T cells and regulatory T cells (Treg), dendritic cells, NK cells, neutrophils and mast cells are present in both healthy and diseased hearts. Most cell subsets are found within the myocardium, whilst mast cells are found also in the epicardium. Upon induction of pressure overload, immune activation occurs across the entire range of immune cell types. Activation led to upregulation of key subset-specific molecules, such as Osm in pro-inflammatory macrophages and PD-1 in Treg, that may help explain clinical findings such as the refractivity of HF patients to anti-TNF therapy and cardiac toxicity during anti-PD-1 cancer , respectively.  Despite the absence of infectious agents or an autoimmune trigger, induction of disease leads to immune activation that involves far more cell types than previously thought, including neutrophils, B cells, NK cells and mast cells. This opens up the field of cardio-immunology to further investigation using toolkits that have already been developed to study the immune subsets above. The subset-specific molecules that mediate their activation may thus become useful targets for diagnostics or therapy of HF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668206> and Radiation: Charting a Path Forward Together.</a></h2><p>Preclinical studies combining  and radiation therapy have suggested promising synergy, prompting translation into clinical trials.

The principle of action can be explained as "brake theory". After releasing the brakes by ICIs, unprecedented systemic toxicities, even some refractory and fatal immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) may develop. In this article, we summarized the recommended treatments of grade 3-4 severe irAEs in the latest European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)/American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), Society for  of Cancer (SITC) and Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) guidelines and consensus. We also performed a systemic review of case reports and reviews of irAEs up to May 20, 2019 in PubMed and Chinese journals. Successful applications of specific immunosuppressive drugs and stimulating factors beyond the above guidelines and consensus were supplemented and highlighted, including agents blocking interleukin 6 (IL-6), rituximab, anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti-integrin 4 mAb, Janus kinase inhibitors, thrombopoietin receptor agonists and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) etc. We put some concerns of using high-dose steroids for long-term, and emphasize the secondary infections, tumor progression, and unavailability of ICI re-challenge during steroid treatment. We propose the "De-escalation Therapy" principle for severe and refractory irAEs, and suggest that immunosuppressive drugs specifically targeting cytokines should be used as early as possible.

Associations between molecular subtypes and specific features was assessed using logistic regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided.We demonstrated that each TNBC molecular subtype exhibits distinct TME profiles associated with specific immune, vascularization, stroma and metabolism biological processes together with specific immune composition and localization. The immunomodulatory subtype was associated with the highest expression of adaptive immune-related gene signatures and a fully inflamed spatial pattern appearing to be the optimal candidate for immune check-point inhibitors. In contrast, most mesenchymal stem-like and luminal androgen receptor (LAR) tumors showed an immunosuppressive phenotype as witnessed by high expression levels of stromal signatures. Basal-like, LAR and Mesenchymal subtypes exhibited an immune cold phenotype associated with stromal and metabolism TME signatures and enriched in margin restricted spatial pattern. Tumors with high chromosomal instability and copy number loss in chromosome 5q and 15q regions including genomic loss of MHC-related genes showed reduced cytotoxic activity, as a plausible immune escape mechanism.Our results demonstrate that each TNBC subtype is associated with specific TME profiles, setting the ground for a rationale tailoring of  in TNBC patients.© The Author(s) 2019.

One objective is assessing antigen-induced T cell activation because only functionally active T cells are capable of killing the desired targets. Autofluorescence imaging can distinguish T cell activity states in a non-destructive manner by detecting endogenous changes in metabolic co-enzymes such as NAD(P)H. However, recognizing robust activity patterns is computationally challenging in the absence of exogenous labels. We demonstrate machine learning methods that can accurately classify T cell activity across human donors from NAD(P)H intensity images. Using 8,260 cropped single-cell images from six donors, we evaluate classifiers ranging from traditional models that use previously-extracted image features to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) pre-trained on general non-biological images. Adapting pre-trained CNNs for the T cell activity classification task provides substantially better performance than traditional models or a simple CNN trained with the autofluorescence images alone.

Immunotherapeutical agents represent an emerging option for breast cancer treatment, including the human epidermal growth factor 2 positive (HER2+) subtype. The immune system holds the ability to spontaneously implement a defensive response against HER2+ BC cells through complex mechanisms which can be exploited to modulate this response for obtaining a clinical benefit. Initial immune system modulating strategies consisted mostly in vaccine therapies, which are still being investigated and improved. However, the entrance of trastuzumab into the scenery of HER2+ BC treatment was the real game changing event, which embodied a dominant immune-mediated mechanism. More recently, the advent of the immune checkpoint inhibitors has caused a new paradigm shift for immuno-oncology, with promising initial results also for HER2+ BC. Breast cancer has been traditionally considered poorly immunogenic, being characterized by relatively low tumor mutation burden (TMB). Nevertheless, recent evidence has revealed high tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in a considerable proportion of HER2+ BC patients. This may translate into a higher potential to elicit anti-cancer response and, therefore, wider possibilities for the use and implementation of  in this subset of BC patients.

Our findings demonstrated that DOX-MNPs treatment inhibited tumor growth with good safety profile and avasimibe treatment combined DOX-MNPs treatment exhibited a better efficacy than monotherapies in 4T1 breast cancer therapy.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671581>Overview of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and The ITA.LI.CA Cohort Derived Estimate of Amenability Rate to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Clinical Practice.</a></h2><p>Despite progress in our understanding of the biology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), this tumour remains difficult-to-cure for several reasons, starting from the particular disease environment where it arises-advanced chronic liver disease-to its heterogeneous clinical and biological behaviour. The advent, and good results, of  for cancer called for the evaluation of its potential application also in HCC, where there is evidence of intra-hepatic immune response activation. Several studies advanced our knowledge of immune checkpoints expression in HCC, thus suggesting that immune checkpoint blockade may have a strong rationale even in the treatment of HCC. According to this background, initial studies with tremelimumab, a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor, and nivolumab, a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody, showed promising results, and further studies exploring the effects of other immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or with other drugs, are currently underway. However, we are still far from the identification of the correct setting, and sequence, where these drugs might be used in clinical practice, and their actual applicability in real-life is unknown. This review focuses on HCC immunobiology and on the potential of immune checkpoint blockade therapy for this tumour, with a critical evaluation of the available trials on immune checkpoint blocking antibodies treatment for HCC. Moreover, it assesses the potential applicability of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the real-life setting, by analysing a large, multicentre cohort of Italian patients with HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650201>Insights in the immunobiology of glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>Glioblastoma, a grade IV astrocytoma, is considered as the most malignant intracranial tumor, characterized by poor prognosis and therapy resistance. Tumor heterogeneity that often leads to distinct functional phenotypes contributes to glioblastoma (GB) indispensable growth and aggressiveness. The complex interaction of neoplastic cells with tumor microenvironment (TME) along with the presence of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) largely confers to extrinsic and intrinsic GB heterogeneity. Recent data indicate that glioma cells secrete a variety of soluble immunoregulatory factors to attract different cell types to TME including astrocytes, endothelial cells, circulating stem cells, and a range of immune cells. These further induce a local production of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors which upon crosstalk with extracellular matrix (ECM) components reprogram immune cells to inflammatory or anti-inflammatory phenotypes and manipulate host's immune response in favor of cancer growth and metastasis. Herein, we provide an overview of the immunobiologic factors that orchestrate the complex network of glioma cells and TME interactions in an effort to identify potential therapeutic targets for GB malignancy. Current therapeutic schemes and advances in targeting GB-TME crosstalk are further discussed. KEY MESSAGES: • Intrinsic and extrinsic tumor heterogeneity affects GB growth and aggressiveness. • GB cells secrete growth factors and chemoattractants to recruit immune cells to TME. • GAMs are a critical cell type in promoting GB growth. • GAMs change from pro-inflammatory, anti-tumor M1 phenotype to pro-tumorigenic M2. • Novel therapeutic agents target the crosstalk of neoplastic cells with TME.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665735>Comparison of Six Different Allergen Extracts for Subcutaneous Specific  in Children: An Open-Labelled, Prospective, Controlled Observational Trial.</a></h2><p>Numerous products are available for subcutaneous (SCIT) and sublingual allergen-specific , but there are no information about the direct comparability regarding efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the different extracts.The aim of this open-labelled, prospective, controlled observational trial was to test the feasibility of a comparison of different products for SCIT in children.Pediatrician practices recruited patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (AR) with or without asthma and an allergic sensitization against grass pollen allergen. Every patient was offered SCIT with one out of six allergen extracts: ALK SQ Depot, ALK Avanz, Allergovit, Depigoid, Purethal, Pollinex Quattro. Scores for symptoms and medications were calculated and the difference between treatment years and baseline were recorded.In total, 284 were recruited and 255 children (89.8%; mean age 10.4, SD 3.54 years; 65% males) participated in this trial. Overall, 49,649 patient days were recorded in the electronic database (mean 183.2 days/patient). There was no significant difference in the AR and asthma symptom score or the medication score between the six different SCIT preparations. Similarly, no differences were observed in terms of safety and tolerability.The comparison of different SCIT products using an online tool is feasible. Based on our preliminary data, all extracts indicated efficacy; however, larger groups would be necessary to demonstrate superiority or non-inferiority of one specific SCIT product.© 2019 S.

Until recently, beclin-1 was a protein known mainly for its role as a critical regulator of autophagy. In this issue of the JCI, Tan et al. describe the effects of the beclin-1 conditional myeloid cell-specific deletion in mice, in which immunostimulation resulted in hypersensitive neutrophils. The chronic proinflammatory effect of these neutrophils triggered spontaneous B cell malignancies to develop. Such tumorigenic effects were mediated primarily by IL-21 and CD40 signaling, leading to the upregulation of tolerogenic molecules, such as IL-10 and PD-L1. The authors went on to examine samples derived from patient lymphoid malignancies and showed that beclin-1 expression in neutrophils positively correlated with pre-B cell leukemia/lymphoma. Overall, the study provides an elegant model for neutrophil-driven carcinogenesis and identifies potential targets for  of B cell malignancies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650942>[The Use of Glucocorticoid in the Management of Adverse Effects Related to Immunocheckpoint Inhibitors].</a></h2><p>Immunocheckpoint inhibitors (ICIs) activated the patients' tumor immunity to kill the tumor cell, and brought new hope to patients with tumor. However, a series of immunocheckpoint inhibitors related adverse effects (irAEs) may also occur based on immune injury. Glucocorticoids are the basis for the treatment of such irAEs. However, the usage, dosage and course of treatment of glucocorticoid in irAEs are different from those in classic autoimmune diseases.

We evaluated the expression of PD-L1 in carcinoma cells (Ca) and immune cells (ICs) across histopathologic and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) molecular subgroups of endometrial carcinoma (EC). Our study included 842 patients with EC. Direct sequencing of polymerase epsilon (POLE) exonuclease domain hot spots and conventional immunohistochemistry (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6, p53) were conducted to identify TCGA classification-based molecular subgroups of EC: POLE-mutated, mismatch repair deficient, no specific molecular profile, and p53 aberrant. Multiplex immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate PD-L1 expression in Ca and tumor-infiltrating ICs. PD-L1 expression in Ca and in ICs was detected in 8.6% and 27.7% of the cases, respectively. A combined positive score (CPS) was ≥1% in 19.4% of the samples. PD-L1 positivity in Ca and ICs, and CPS correlated with tumor T-cell density (P<0.001). POLE-mutated and mismatch repair-deficient tumors were more likely to present PD-L1-expressing ICs, CPS positivity, and abundant tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes compared with other TCGA subgroups (P<0.001). No differences existed in Ca-PD-L1 expression (P=0.366). Within various histotypes, non-endometrioid carcinomas displayed the highest Ca-PD-L1, ICs, and CPS (P<0.03). Advanced cancers showed more frequent Ca-PD-L1 positivity (P=0.016), and CPS (P=0.029) and IC≥1% (P=0.037) positivity compared with early disease. In conclusion, PD-L1 expression profiles differ between molecular subclasses, histologic subtypes, and disease stage of EC. Prospective studies are needed to explore the predictive value of various PD-L1 scoring systems within the subgroups of EC. CPS presents methodological advantages over cell type-specific scoring systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671191>An umbrella study of biomarker-driven targeted therapy in patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer: a Korean Gynecologic Oncology Group study (KGOG 3045), AMBITION.</a></h2><p>A pilot study of biomarker-driven targeted therapy in patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer has been started in Korea.

Diverse types and etiologies of NORSE are reported in various groups. Limbic encephalitis (LE) is reported as one of etiologies of NORSE. In this study, we investigated whether there were any intersections between NORSE and limbic encephalitis, as well as the presence of prognostic factors in intersection patients.We retrospectively analyzed patients who met both the definition of NORSE and diagnostic criteria of LE at the initial presentation from our database. Clinical characteristics and blood test, cerebrospinal fluid, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging results were reviewed. Prognosis was recorded as ICU admission stay, total length of hospitalization, and modified Rankin Scale at discharge. In particular, we determined which factors were associated with patients' prognosis.Thirteen patients were selected. Nine of the 13 patients had myalgia and 8 patients had fever in the prodromal period. Twelve of the 13 patients had acute memory impairment or confusion before SE development. In addition, 46.2% of the patients showed leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. Median body temperature at hospital arrival was 37.6 °C. Nine patients showed generalized tonic-clonic SE. All patients were treated with  and 11 of the 13 patients achieved burst suppression through induced coma therapy. Ten patients showed lesion extension on follow-up imaging. The most common extension site was the claustrum. Patients with more lesion extension showed poorer outcomes than those without lesion extension.Subsequent extratemporal lesion extension was closely associated with poor prognosis in NORSE-LE patients. This study explores a new subtype of NORSE and suggests a possible common underlying pathomechanism between NORSE and LE.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, copy number alteration (CNA)-driven dysregulated genes and their functions in CC are still rarely investigated. In the present study, we conducted integrative analysis of CNA and gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cervical cancer to identify dysregulated genes triggered by CNAs. The integration of copy number status and RNA expression revealed 763 amplified and 1,391 deleted genes significantly dysregulated by the CNAs (P-value < 1e-8). Among these CNA genes, five driver genes, including PI3KCA, PI3KCB, DVL3, WWTR1, and ERBB2, exhibited a strong association with immune cell infiltration, suggesting that the pathways that they participate in may be involved in regulating immune cell infiltration. Moreover, we also observed that the genes of immunotherapeutic targets were abundantly expressed in the wild-type samples, suggesting that  based on these immunotherapeutic targets may be applied to wild-type samples. In addition, the two CNA driver genes, DVL3 and ERBB2, might be sensitive and resistant biomarkers for examining the tumor's response to chemoradiotherapy, respectively. Particularly, the expression of ERBB2 was also observed to be higher in responders of chemotherapy than non-responders. Furthermore, a subset of CNA genes was identified to predict the prognosis of cervical cancer. In summary, our systematic data analysis of these CNA genes not only improved our understanding of the veiled mechanism behind immune cell infiltration, but also provided the potential clinical application of these CNA genes in cervical cancer.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We developed a microfluidics-based CTC platform to explore CTC profiling utility in CII-treated patients with melanoma using a melanoma messenger RNA (mRNA)/DNA biomarker panel.Blood samples (n = 213) were collected prospectively from 75 American Joint Committee on Cancer-staged III/IV melanoma patients during CII treatment and those enriched for CTCs. CTC profiling was performed using 5 known melanoma mRNA biomarkers and BRAF V600E DNA mutation. CTC biomarker status associations with clinical outcomes were assessed.CTCs were detected in 88% of blood samples from patients with melanoma. CTC-derived biomarkers and clinical variables analyzed using classification and regression tree analysis revealed that a combination of lactate dehydrogenase, CTC-mRNA biomarkers, and tumor BRAF-mutation status was indicative of clinical outcomes for patients with stage IV melanoma (n = 52). The panel stratified low-risk and high-risk patients, whereby the latter had poor disease-free ( = 0.03) and overall survival ( = 0.02). Incorporation of a DNA biomarker with mRNA profiling increased overall CTC-detection capability by 57% compared to mRNA profiling only. RNA sequencing of isolated CTCs identified significant catenin beta 1 () overexpression ( <0.01) compared to nondisease donor blood. CTC- was associated with progressive disease/stable disease compared to complete-responder patient status ( = 0.02).

However, many novel "non-canonical" functions, alternative substrates, and regulatory mechanisms have been described and are being continuously elucidated. The activity of LOXs, therefore, appears to be integrated into a complex network of signals regulating many cell functions, including survival/proliferation/differentiation. Among these signaling pathways, TGF-β and PI3K/Akt/mTOR, in particular, cross-talk extensively with each other and with LOXs also initiating complex feedback loops which modulate the activity of LOXs and direct the remodeling of the ECM. A growing body of evidence indicates that LOXs are not only important in the homeostasis of the normal structure of the ECM, but are also implicated in the establishment and maturation of the tumor microenvironment. LOXs' association with advanced and metastatic cancer is well established; however, there is enough evidence to support a significant role of LOXs in the transformation of normal epithelial cells, in the accelerated tumor development and the induction of invasion of the premalignant epithelium.

Additional strategies are necessary to improve these agents' efficacy.Patients with stable disease for at least 4 months on TKI or checkpoint inhibitors were included. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) was delivered to an organ with comparable lesions, where one lesion was in the treatment target and the other one was intentionally left untreated (control lesion). Response in both lesions was scored using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors V.1.1 criteria 2 months after completion of SBRT. The primary endpoint was the rate of SBRT adverse events, and the secondary endpoints included the rate of reduction in target lesion size.17 patients were enrolled (14 men and 3 women, median age: 54.5 years old). SBRT was delivered to the lungs (n=5), bones (n=4), lymph nodes (n=4), liver (n=1), primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (n=1) and locally recurrent RCC (n=2). The equivalent dose in 2 Gy with an alpha to beta ratio of 2.6 was 114 Gy. With a median follow-up of 8 months, the cumulative rate of SBRT-related toxicity (grade 1) was 12% (n=2), consisting of oesophagitis and skin erythema. No grade 2 or higher toxicity was detected. Radiographic response in the target lesion was seen in 13 patients (76%), with complete response in 5 (29%) patients and partial response in 8 (47%), including abscopal effect in 1 patient. Control lesions remained stable in 16 patients. The difference between response in the target and control lesions as judged by the mean sizes of these lesions before and at 2 months after SBRT was statistically significant (p<0.01).

These structures can be covered by filter-like diaphragms. A transmembrane PLVAP (plasmalemma vesicle associated protein) protein has been shown to be necessary for the formation of diaphragms. The expression, subcellular localization and fenestra-forming role of PLVAP in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) have remained controversial. Here we show that fenestrations in LSEC contain PLVAP-diaphragms during the fetal angiogenesis, but they lose the diaphragms at birth. Although it is thought that PLVAP only localizes to diaphragms, we found luminal localization of PLVAP in adult LSEC using several imaging techniques. Plvap-deficient mice revealed that the absence of PLVAP and diaphragms did not affect the morphology, the number of fenestrations or the overall vascular architecture in the liver sinusoids. Nevertheless, PLVAP in fetal LSEC (fenestrations with diaphragms) associated with LYVE-1 (lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1), neuropilin-1 and VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2), whereas in the adult LSEC (fenestrations without diaphragms) these complexes disappeared. Collectively, our data show that PLVAP can be expressed on endothelial cells without diaphragms, contradict the prevailing concept that biogenesis of fenestrae would be PLVAP-dependent, and reveal previously unknown PLVAP-dependent molecular complexes in LSEC during angiogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666198>Primary adenocarcinoma of the bladder lacks mismatch repair deficiency and demonstrates PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells, with implications in both diagnosis and therapeutics.</a></h2><p>Primary adenocarcinoma of the bladder is a rare and highly aggressive disease with no standard therapy. Effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade in bladder adenocarcinoma is unknown due to lack of clinical trials. Due to the disease rarity, the rate of PD-L1 expression and DNA mismatch repair deficiency is largely unknown. In this study, we examined PD-L1 expression in 56 cases of bladder adenocarcinoma and mismatch repair protein expression in 42 cases of bladder adenocarcinoma using immunohistochemistry. Mismatch repair protein expression was uniformly intact in all cases of bladder adenocarcinoma, in comparison with 19% of advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma being mismatch repair deficient. This finding indicates that mismatch repair proteins may be combined with β-catenin and GATA-3 to create an immunostaining panel which, in addition to clinical studies, can aid in distinguishing bladder adenocarcinoma from secondary involvement by colorectal carcinoma. 4% of cases were found to overexpress PD-L1 in tumor cells while approximately a third of cases were found to display PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells.

In this retrospective study, over 600 tumour samples from different solid and haematological malignancies were analysed while using one validated IHC method. CD70 and CD27 expression was demonstrated in a broad range of tumour types. In solid tumours, 43% demonstrated CD70 positivity with the highest degree in renal cell carcinoma (79.5%). Kaposi sarcoma showed no CD70 expression on the tumour cells. In lymphoma samples, 58% demonstrated CD70 positivity. Moreover, the co-expression of CD70 and CD27 was observed in 39% of lymphoma samples. These findings highlight the need to further explore anti-CD70 therapies in a broad range of CD70 expressing tumour types and in doing so, implementing one standardised protocol to define CD70 overexpression to use it as a diagnostic tool.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661153> in Colorectal Cancer.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer deaths, with only 15% of patients surviving 5 years in the metastatic setting. Recent exciting developments in cancer , which involves priming the host's natural immune defenses to recognize, target, and destroy cancer cells effectively, have brought some glimpse of hope in fighting this deadly disease. Although CRC has been shown to evade immune detection like many other cancers do,  has been noted to produce some very impressive results in a select group of patients. Patients with mismatch repair-deficient and microsatellite instability-high type CRC have benefited most from recent  approaches, leading to US Food and Drug Administration approval of new immunotherapeutic agents in recurrent refractory metastatic disease. Research continues to explore and hopefully define the role of  in CRC as single-agent therapy or in combination with other agents in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and first-line metastatic setting, and to find the optimal combination and sequencing of this new therapeutic approach. One of the most challenging tasks is to find ways to expand the use of  to not only a select group of CRC patients but also to all patients with this disease. This article will provide a practical concise overview of the current landscape of  in CRC for the practicing oncologist along with a representative case presentation from our community oncology practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646063>Defining potency of CAR T cells: Fast and furious or slow and steady.</a></h2><p>Genetically engineered T cells that express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) are heterogeneous and thus, understanding the immunotherapeutic efficacy remains a challenge in adoptive cell therapy.

However, there are two main challenges in successfully utilizing macrophages for . First, macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) secreted by cancer cells binds to colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1-R) on macrophages and in turn activates the downstream signaling pathway responsible for polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to immunosuppressive M2 phenotype. Second, ligation of signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) expressed on myeloid cells to CD47, a transmembrane protein overexpressed on cancer cells, activates the Src homology region 2 (SH2) domain -phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 in macrophages. This results in activation of "eat-me-not" signaling pathway and inhibition of phagocytosis. Here, it is reported that self-assembled dual-inhibitor-loaded nanoparticles (DNTs) target M2 macrophages and simultaneously inhibit CSF1R and SHP2 pathways. This results in efficient repolarization of M2 macrophages to an active M1 phenotype, and superior phagocytic capabilities as compared to individual drug treatments. Furthermore, suboptimal dose administration of DNTs in highly aggressive breast cancer and melanoma mouse models show enhanced anti-tumor efficacy without any toxicity. These studies demonstrate that the concurrent inhibition of CSF1-R and SHP2 signaling pathways for macrophage activation and phagocytosis enhancement could be an effective strategy for macrophage-based .© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells are crucial for the rejection of established tumors. We constructed XCL1-GPC3 fusion molecules as a liver cancer vaccine by linking the XCL1 chemokine to glypican-3 (GPC3), which is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cells expressing XCL1-GPC3 chemoattracted murine XCR1+CD8α+DCs and human XCR1+CD141+DCs in vitro and promoted their IL-12 production. After subcutaneous mXcl1-GPC3 plasmid injection, mXCL1-GPC3 was mainly detected in CD8α+DCs of mouse draining lymph nodes. XCL1-GPC3-targeted DCs enhanced antigen-specific CD8+ T cell-proliferation and induced the de novo generation of GPC3-specific CD8+ T cells, which abolished GPC3-expressing tumor cells in mouse and human systems. We immunized a murine autochthonous liver cancer model, with a hepatitis B background, with the mXcl1-GPC3 plasmid starting six weeks, when malignant hepatocyte clusters formed, or 14 weeks, when liver tumor nodules developed, after diethylnitrosamine administration. mXcl1-GPC3 immunized mice displayed significantly inhibited tumor formation and growth compared to GPC3-immunized mice. After mXcl1-GPC3 immunization, mouse livers showed elevated production of IFNγ, granzyme B, IL-18, CCL5, CXCL19, Xcl1, and increased infiltration of GPC3-specific CD8+ T cells, activated NK cells and NKT cells. The antitumor effects of these immune cells were further enhanced by the administration of anti-PD1. Anti-HCC effects induced by hXCL1-GPC3 were confirmed in HCC-PDX model from three patients.

Thus, its natural history is not well defined and treatment recommendations come from small retrospective studies. Data on managing PTFL with radiation therapy alone is particularly sparse. Here, we describe a 17 year-old male who presented in June 2017 with a slowly enlarging right-sided cervical neck mass. An initial core biopsy was performed which showed reactive follicular hyperplasia. Four months later, the mass had enlarged significantly and an excision biopsy again showed reactive follicular hyperplasia. Further excision of five cervical lymph-nodes revealed expanded follicles with attenuated mantle-zones. Follicles were composed of medium sized atypical lymphoid cells; centroblasts were increased. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated follicles with cells expressing CD20, CD10, PAX-5, OCT-2, BOB-1 and BCL-6; Cyclin D1 was negative. MIB-1 was greater than 90% in follicles. Polymerase chain reaction analysis identified a clonal B-cell profile. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization did not detect t(14;18), BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangement and breaks in IRF-4/DUSP22 and MYC were not detected. These findings were in keeping with a diagnosis of PTFL. PET/CT imaging confirmed disease isolated to the right neck, but unfortunately unresectable due to anatomic location. The patient declined treatment with chemo- and was thus treated with local radiotherapy, which was well tolerated. He achieved a complete response and remains in remission six months later.

Although undeniable success has been observed in clinical trials, not all patients respond to treatment. Different concurrent conditions can attenuate or completely abrogate the usefulness of  due to the activation of several escape mechanisms. Indeed, the tumor microenvironment has an almost full immunosuppressive profile, creating an obstacle to therapeutic treatment. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) governs a plethora of cellular processes, including maintenance of genomic stability, cell survival/apoptosis, migration, and metabolism. The repertoire of PTEN functions has recently been expanded to include regulation of the tumor microenvironment and immune system, leading to a drastic reevaluation of the canonical paradigm of PTEN action with new potential implications for -based approaches. Understanding the implication of PTEN in cancer immunoediting and immune evasion is crucial to develop new cancer intervention strategies.

Although phototherapy and some chemotherapy can trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) for T cell-mediated antitumor immune response, their  efficacy is severely restricted by insufficient phototherapeutic capability and severe multidrug resistance (MDR). Inspired by both the hypersensitivity to phototherapy and the key role in MDR for mitochondria, a rationally engineered immunity amplifier via mitochondria-targeted photo-chemotherapeutic nanoparticles was, for the first time, achieved to fight against low-immunogenic breast cancer without additional immune agent.

It is an overwhelming task to discover drug-like inhibitors of glycosyl transferases that block the synthesis of specific branching processes in cancer cells, killing tumor cells selectively. It has long been known that -glycan biosynthesis can be inhibited by disruption of the first committed enzyme, dolichyl-phosphate -acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase 1 (DPAGT1). Selective DPAGT1 inhibitors have the promising therapeutic potential for certain solid cancers that require increased branching of -linked glycans in their growth progressions. Recently, we discovered that an anti- molecule, aminouridyl phenoxypiperidinbenzyl butanamide (APPB) showed DPAGT1 inhibitory activity with the IC value of 0.25 μM. It was confirmed that APPB inhibits -glycosylation of β-catenin at 2.5 nM concentration. A sharp difference between APPB and tunicamycin was that the hemolytic activity of APPB is significantly attenuated (IC > 200 μM RBC). Water solubility of APPB is >350-times greater than that of tunicamycin (78.8 mg/mL for APPB, <0.2 mg/mL for tunicamycin). A novel DPAGT1 inhibitor, APPB selectively inhibits growth of the solid tumors (.

We describe the occurrence and management of metastatic spread of a pulmonary carcinoma to the rectum.The patient was a 79-year-old woman who had undergone thoracoscopic left lobectomy for pulmonary adenocarcinoma and then, over the next 11 years, various drugs (carboplatin + paclitaxel (as adjuvant therapy), gefitinib, gemcitabine + vinorelbine, S1 (an oral 5-fluorouracil-based drug), carboplatin + pemetrexed + bevacizumab, erlotinib, nivolumab, afatinib, and carboplatin+ S1) were administered, especially for hilar and mediastinal lymph node recurrences. During the eleventh postoperative year, left and right iliac bone metastases were detected, and radiation therapy was undertaken for local control of these lesions. When F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography was performed for evaluation of the disease, tracer accumulation in the upper rectum was seen. Colonoscopic examination of the rectum revealed an intramural mass with central ulceration, and the mass was diagnosed histologically as an adenocarcinoma. The bone metastases appeared to be controlled, and the patient's performance status was good, but she had suffered constipation for about a year and desired treatment. Thus, laparoscopic low anterior resection was performed. Histopathologic analysis revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma existing mainly between the submucosa and serosa, and immunohistochemical analysis showed the tumor to be positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7, negative for CK20, positive for thyroid transcription factor-1, and negative for special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 and caudal type homeobox 2, confirming the diagnosis of rectal metastasis from the primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

The combination of quercetin (Q) and alantolactone (A) was found to induce synergistic immunogenic cell death (ICD) at a molar ratio of 1:4 (Q:A). To achieve ratiometric loading and delivery, the micellar delivery of Q and A (QA-M) was developed with high entrapment efficiency and drug loading at an optimal ratio. QA-M achieved prolonged blood circulation and increased tumor accumulation for both drugs. More importantly, QA-M retained the desired drug ratio (molar ratio of Q to A = 1:4) in tumors at 2 and 4 h after intravenous injection for synergistic . Tumor growth was significantly inhibited in murine orthotopic CRC by the treatment of QA-M compared to PBS and the combination of free drugs ( < 0.005). The combination of nanotherapy stimulated the host immune response to induce long-term tumor destruction and induced memory tumor surveillance with a 1.3-fold increase in survival median time compared to PBS ( < 0.0001) and a combination of free drugs ( < 0.0005). The synergistic therapeutic effect induced by codelivery of Q and A is capable of reactivating antitumor immunity by inducing ICD, causing cell toxicity and modulating the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment. Such a combination of Q and A with synergistic effects entrapped in a simple and safe nanodelivery system may provide the potential for scale-up manufacturing and clinical applications as immunotherapeutic agents for CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653272>Immunogenicity of prostate cancer is augmented by BET bromodomain inhibition.</a></h2><p>Prostate cancer responds poorly to current immunotherapies. Epigenetic therapies such as BET Bromodomain inhibition can change the transcriptome of tumor cells, possibly making them more immunogenic and thus susceptible to immune targeting.We characterized the effects of BET bromodomain inhibition using JQ1 on PD-L1 and HLA-ABC expression in two human prostate cell lines, DU145 and PC3. RNA-Seq was performed to assess changes on a genome-wide level. A cytotoxic T cell killing assay was performed in MC38-OVA cells treated with JQ1 to demonstrate increased immunogenicity. In vivo experiments in the Myc-Cap model were conducted to show the effects of JQ1 administration in concert with anti-CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade.Here, we show that targeting BET bromodomains using the small molecule inhibitor JQ1 decreased PD-L1 expression and mitigated tumor progression in prostate cancer models. Mechanistically, BET bromodomain inhibition increased MHC I expression and increased the immunogenicity of tumor cells. Transcriptional profiling showed that BET bromodomain inhibition regulates distinct networks of antigen processing and immune checkpoint molecules. In murine models, treatment with JQ1 was additive with anti-CTLA-4 , resulting in an increased CD8/Treg ratio.BET Bromodomain inhibition can mediate changes in expression at a genome wide level in prostate cancer cells, resulting in an increased susceptibility to CD8 T cell targeting. These data suggest that combining BET bromodomain inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade may have clinical activity in prostate cancer patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670078>Dual inhibition of CSF1R and MAPK pathways using supramolecular nanoparticles enhances macrophage .</a></h2><p>Among the numerous immune interactions, or lack-thereof, that occur during cancer progression, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) - cancer cell interactions have been shown to play an important role in modulating the tumor-microenvironment to an immune suppressive mode, promoting accelerated tumor growth, survival and metastatic spread. TAMs are predominantly polarized to a pro-tumorigenic M2-phenotype through macrophage colony stimulating factor 1 (MCSF) cytokines that bind to the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), a class III receptor tyrosine kinase. This MCSF-CSF1R interaction results in autophosphorylation of CSF1R and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway leading to proliferation, survival and functional activity of M2 TAMs. Therapeutic inhibition of CSF1R and MAPK signaling could effectively re-polarize M2 macrophages to an anti-tumorigenic M1 phenotype; however, this is challenging. In this study, we demonstrate that concurrent and sustained inhibition of the CSF1R and MAPK signaling pathways using dual-kinase inhibitor-loaded supramolecular nanoparticles (DSNs) enhance repolarization of pro-tumorigenic M2 macrophages to the anti-tumorigenic M1 phenotype. The supramolecular nanoparticles exhibited physical stability of over 7 days during storage conditions at 4 °C and over 24 h in human serum, released the inhibitors in a sustained manner and showed significantly higher internalization and accumulation of inhibitors in the M2 macrophages even at longer time points. When tested in a highly aggressive 4T1 breast cancer model, the supramolecular nanoparticles accumulated in TAMs at a significantly higher concentration, increased M1-like phenotype at significantly higher proportion and improved anti-tumor efficacy as compared to combination of single-inhibitor nanoparticles or the small molecule inhibitors. Our data suggests that concurrent, vertical inhibition of multiple intracellular kinase signaling pathways is important for repolarization of M2 macrophages to M1 phenotype, and by utilizing dual-inhibitor loaded supramolecular nanoparticles, further increase the ability to produce more M1 macrophages as compared to M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. This results in enhanced tumor growth inhibition and reduced toxicity. Therefore, vertical, co-inhibition of CSF1R and downstream signaling pathways like MAPK could be a promising macrophage  strategy for aggressive cancers.Copyright © 2019.

However, most protocols developed to expand T cells require relatively long periods of time in culture, potentially leading to progression toward populations of terminally differentiated effector memory cells. Here, we describe in detail a 9-day protocol for CAR gene transduction and expansion of primary rhesus macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Cells produced and expanded with this method show high levels of viability, high levels of co-expression of two transduced genes, retention of the central memory phenotype, and sufficient quantity for immunotherapeutic infusion of 1-2 × 10 cells/kg in a 10 kg rhesus macaque. This 9-day protocol may be broadly used for CAR-T cell and other T cell  approaches to decrease culture time and increase maintenance of central memory populations.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670092>Traf6 inhibitor boosts antitumor immunity by impeding regulatory T cell migration in Hepa1-6 tumor model.</a></h2><p>Tumors escape immune attacks via various mechanisms, among which activation of regulatory pathways in effector immune cells and recruitment of immunosuppressive cells are usually employed. Traf6 is a member of the family of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors and involved in many signaling pathways. While it plays important roles in both tumor biology and immune system, the potential therapeutic role of Traf6 in tumor  hasn't ever been assessed. Here, we confirmed the anti-tumor effect of Traf6 inhibitor in Hepa1-6 tumor model. Flow cytometry-based analysis revealed that T cell-mediated antitumor immunity was provoked and the infiltration of Treg cells was restrained when treated with Traf6 inhibitor. Via an in vivo migration assay, we found that Traf6 inhibitor decreased the population of intratumor Tregs by impeding the migration of Tregs towards tumor. Finally, we demonstrated that combination of Traf6 inhibitor and PD-1 blockade could receive a better antitumor efficiency. These results implicated that Traf6 inhibitor could serve as a supplement for immune checkpoint therapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Light-activated components in nanosystems confer additional phototherapeutic effects as combinatorial modalities; however, systemic and thermal toxicities with unfavorable accumulation and excretion of nanoystem components now hamper their practical applications. Thus, there remains a need for optimal multifunctional nanosystems to enhance targeted, durable, and mild combination therapies for efficient cancer treatment without notable side effects.  A nanosystem constructed with a base core (poly-L-histidine [H]-grafted black phosphorus [BP]) and a shell (erythrocyte membrane [EM]) is developed to offer a mild photoresponsive (near-infrared) activity with erythrocyte mimicry. In-flight electrostatic tailoring to extract uniform BP nanoparticles maintains a hydrodynamic size of <200 nm (enabling enhanced permeability and retention) after EM cloaking and enhances their biocompatibility.  Ephrin-A2 receptor-specific peptide (YSA, targeting cancer cells), interleukin-1α silencing small interfering RNA (ILsi, restricting regulatory T cell trafficking), and paclitaxel (X, inducing durable chemotherapeutics) are incorporated within the base core@shell constructs to create BP-H-ILsi-X@EM-YSA architectures, which provide a more intelligent nanosystem for combination cancer therapies.  The in-flight tailoring of BP particles provides a promising base core for fabricating <200 nm EM-mimicking multifunctional nanosystems, which could be beneficial for constructing smarter nanoarchitectures to use in combination cancer therapies.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650949>[Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment Recommendations for Ocular Toxicities of Target Therapy and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy].</a></h2><p>The increasing use of target therapy and immunocheckpoint inhibitors in cancers has brought new hope of survival to patients with advanced tumors.

In this study, we showed that Lachnum polysaccharide (LEP) could work as an immunomodulator to reset TAMs from pro-tumor M2 to anti-tumor M1 phenotype. Mechanistically, LEP promoted Th1 polarization and the secretion of IFN-γ, which played a key role in M1 phenotype polarization. In parallel, LEP might directly activate M1 macrophages via TLR4 mediated NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, LEP also resulted in the accumulation of anti-tumor immune cells and decrease the infiltration of immunosuppressive cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and Treg cells, thereby potentiating anti-tumor immunity.

However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) also shows favorable outcomes. Although the immunological environment of RC has been thoroughly discussed, the effect of NAC on it is less clear. Here, we investigated the immunological microenvironment, including T-cell infiltration, activation, and topological distribution, of resected RC tissue after neoadjuvant therapies and evaluated the correlation between T-cell subsets and patient prognosis. RC patients (n = 188) were enrolled and categorized into three groups, namely CRT (n = 41), NAC (n = 46), and control (surgery alone; n = 101) groups. Characterization of residual carcinoma cells and T-cell subsets in resected tissues was performed using multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry. The densities of total and activated (Ki67 ) T-cells in tissues after NAC, but not CRT, were higher than in control. In both CRT and NAC groups, patients presenting with higher treatment effects showed aggressive infiltration of T-cell subsets into carcinomas. Multivariate analyses of pathological and immunological features and prognosis revealed that carcinoma Ki67 CD4 T-cells after CRT and stromal Ki67 CD8 T-cells after NAC are important prognostic factors, respectively. Our results suggest that evaluation of T-cell activation with Ki67 expression and its tumor localization can be used to determine the prognosis of advanced RC after neoadjuvant therapies.© 2019 The Authors.

Acidic extracellular pH is a major attribute of the tumor microenvironment (TME) that promotes immune evasion and tumor progression. Therefore, antagonizing tumor acidity can be a powerful approach in cancer . Here, Pluronic F-127 is used as a NaHCO releasing carrier to focally alleviate extracellular tumor acidity. In a mouse tumor model, intratumoral treatment with pH modulating injectable gel (pH-MIG) generates immune-favorable TME, as evidenced by the decrease of immune-suppressive cells and increase of tumor infiltrating CD8 + T cells. The combination of pH-MIG with immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-PD-1 and anti-TIGIT antibodies, increases intratumoral T cell function, which leads to tumor clearance. Mechanistically, extracellular acidity was shown to upregulate co-inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors and inhibit mTOR signaling pathways in memory CD8 + T cells, which impaired effector functions. Furthermore, an acidic pH environment increased the expression and engagement of TIGIT and its ligand CD155, which suggested that the extracellular pH can regulate the suppressive function of TIGIT pathway. Collectively, these findings suggest that pH-MIG holds potential as a new TME modulator for effective immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies.Copyright © 2019.

This synthetic pyrazolone derivative is a potent scavenger of oxygen free radicals and also functions as a modulator of transcription factors, repressing NFκB and activating Nrf2, to regulate oxidative stress. EDA displays complementary anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The injectable small molecule is currently investigated for the treatment of several non-neurological diseases. The potential interest of EDA in oncology is reviewed here. EDA is a mild antiproliferative agent but has been found to enhance significantly the anticancer and antimetastatic activities of irinotecan in a colon cancer model. Anticancer derivatives of EDA have been designed but they generally display a limited antiproliferative activity. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of EDA can be best exploited to protect non-tumor cells from damages induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and radiations. Notably EDA can reduce the renal dysfunction induced by cisplatin, the neurotoxicity of cyclophosphamide and the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. Upon treatment with EDA, a significant improvement in neurologic symptoms has been observed in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy. The drug could be used to limit radiation-induced brain injury or oral mucositis. EDA was found to ameliorate autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), which is a frequent side effect observed after treatment of cancer patients with monoclonal antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint PD-1. Therefore, EDA could also be useful to reduce specific side effects of immuno-therapy.

Here, we reported a nanovaccine, which was produced by encapsulating OVA (ovalbumin, a model antigen) chemically modified with MPGΔNLS (MPGΔNLS-OVA conjugate) into poly(lactide-co-glycolide) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles. We hypothesized that after the uptake of the nanovaccine into immune cells, MPGΔNLS, a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), would assist the escape of the antigens from lysosomes into the cytosol, increase the amount of antigens processed in the cytosol and subsequently enhance antigen cross-presentation via MHC-I molecules to elicit cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses. The results of the in vitro experiments demonstrated that the MPGΔNLS-OVA-loaded PLGA NPs not only elevated the release of OVA into the cytosol of dendritic cells (BMDCs), but also promoted the maturation and activation of BMDCs. It was also observed in mice vaccinated with MPGΔNLS-OVA-loaded PLGA NPs that the MPGΔNLS modification could stimulate the expansion of OVA-specific T-cells, generation of OVA-specific IgG antibodies and proliferation of OVA-specific memory T cells. Moreover, the treatment of E·G7-OVA tumor-bearing mice with MPGΔNLS-OVA-loaded PLGA NPs resulted in significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival periods of the mice compared to the treatment with unmodified OVA-PLGA NPs or free OVA. In summary, cell-penetrating peptides linked with antigens encapsulated in nanovaccines can spatiotemporally affect the intracellular localization of antigens, promote antigen cross-presentation and stimulate antigen-specific immune responses, especially CTL responses.

Despite encouraging and sometimes durable responses in a subset of patients, most patients do not respond. Tumors have adopted the PD-1/PD-L1 axis for immune escape to facilitate tumor growth, which can be leveraged as a potential target for immune checkpoint inhibitors. On this basis, PD-L1 protein expression on tumor or immune cells emerged as the first potential predictive biomarker for sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. The goal of our study was to evaluate PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker based on all US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug approvals of immune checkpoint inhibitors. We evaluated the primary studies associated with 45 FDA drug approvals from 2011 until April 2019. In total, there were approvals across 15 tumor types. Across all approvals, PD-L1 was predictive in only 28.9% of cases, and was either not predictive (53.3%) or not tested (17.8%) in the remaining cases. There were 9 FDA approvals linked to a specific PD-L1 threshold and companion diagnostic: bladder cancer (N = 3), non-small cell lung cancer (N = 3), triple-negative breast cancer (N = 1), cervical cancer (N = 1), and gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer (N = 1) with 8 of 9 (88.9%) with immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy. The PD-L1 thresholds were variable both within and across tumor types using several different assays, including approvals at the following PD-L1 thresholds: 1, 5, and 50%. PD-L1 expression was also measured in a variable fashion either on tumor cells, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, or both. In conclusion, our findings indicate that PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker has limitations and that the decision to pursue testing must be carefully implemented for clinical decision-making.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666344>Prolonged survival in the absence of disease-recurrence in advanced-stage follicular lymphoma following chemo-: 13-year update of the prospective, multicenter randomized GITMO-IIL trial.</a></h2><p>A prospective trial conducted in the period 2000-2005 showed no survival advantage for high-dose chemotherapy with rituximab and autograft (R-HDS)  conventional chemotherapy with rituximab (CHOP-R) as first-line therapy in 134 high-risk follicular lymphoma patients aged <60 years. The study has been updated at the 13-year median follow up. As of February 2017, 88 (66%) patients were alive, with overall survival of 66.4% at 13 years, without a significant difference between R-HDS (64.5%) and CHOP-R (68.5%). To date, 46 patients have died, mainly because of disease progression (47.8% of all deaths), secondary malignancies (3 solid tumor, 9 myelodysplasia/acute leukemia; 26.1% of all deaths), and other toxicities (21.7% of all deaths). Complete remission was documented in 98 (73.1%) patients and associated with overall survival, with 13-year estimates of 77.0% and 36.8% for complete remission  no-complete remission, respectively. Molecular remission was documented in 39 (65%) out of 60 evaluable patients and associated with improved survival. In multivariate analysis, complete remission achievement had the strongest effect on survival (<0.001), along with younger age (=0.002) and female sex (=0.013). Overall, 50 patients (37.3%) survived with no disease recurrence (18 CHOP-R, 32 R-HDS). This follow up is the longest reported on follicular lymphoma treated upfront with rituximab-chemotherapy and demonstrates an unprecedented improvement in survival compared to the pre-rituximab era, regardless of the use of intensified or conventional treatment. Complete remission was the most important factor for prolonged survival and a high proportion of patients had prolonged survival in their first remission, raising the issue of curability in follicular lymphoma.

About efficacy biomarker of allergen .</a></h2><p>Nowadays, people pay more attention to biomarkers that can predict clinical efficacy of  for allergic rhinitis. As the only recognized aetiological treatment, the efficacy of allergen  (AIT) has been proved by many studies. However, treatment success depends on compliance and persistence greatly, which can be impaired by the lengthy duration of AIT and socioeconomic status of patients. Besides, ineffectiveness is another factor that accounts for non-adherence. If the clinical efficacy can be predicted in the early stage of , it can help patients choose appropriate treatment plans, increase patient compliance and optimize the allocation of medical resources. This paper mainly focuses on five candidate biomarkers, the sIgE/tIgE ratio before treatment, serum inhibitory activity for IgE, decreased basophil activation, upregulation of Tregs and tolerogenic DCs, reviews the time when potential biomarkers can predict or monitor the efficacy of AIT, discusses the reason why these indicators could serve as efficacy biomarkers and interactions among potential biomarkers.© 2019 The Scandinavian Foundation for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656319>Update Breast Cancer 2019 Part 5 - Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenges of New, Personalised Therapies in Patients with Advanced Breast Cancer.</a></h2><p>Significant advancements have been made in recent years in advanced breast cancer and nearly all of them have been in the field of targeted therapy. Pertuzumab and trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) have been able to be introduced in HER2-positive breast cancer. Now other anti-HER2 therapies are being developed (e.g. margetuximab, DS-8201a, pyrotinib) which can overcome other resistance mechanisms in the HER2 signalling pathway. In the field of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, an mTOR inhibitor and CDK4/6 inhibitors were introduced in the past. Now the introduction of the first PI3K inhibitor is forthcoming and this inhibitor will involve genetic testing of the tumour for a mutation in the PIK3CA gene. There are also significant advancements in triple-negative breast cancer: By combining chemotherapy and , an advantage for overall survival was able to be demonstrated in a subgroup (immune cells PD-L1-positive). The PARP inhibitor therapy for HER2-negative patients with a germ line mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 was also associated with an improved overall survival in a subgroup.

In particular, it remains unexplored how driver mutations could be associated with distinct TIBs signatures and their role in tumor microenvironment.Here we analyzed associations of immunoglobulin isotypes and clonality with survival in TCGA RNA-Seq data for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), stratifying patients into 12 driver mutation and phenotypic tumor subgroups.We revealed several unexpected associations between TIBs behavior and prognosis. Abundance and high proportion of IgG1 isotype, and low proportion of IgA among all intratumorally produced immunoglobulins were specifically associated with improved overall survival for KRAS but not KRAS LUAD, revealing the first link between a driver mutation and B-cell response. We found specific IgG1 signature associated with long survival, which suggests that particular specificities of IgG1+ TIBs could be beneficial in KRAS LUAD. In contrast to our previous observations for melanoma, highly clonal IgG1 production by plasma cells had no meaningful effect on prognosis, suggesting that IgG1+ TIBs may exert a beneficial effect in KRAS cases in an alternative way, such as efficient presentation of cognate antigens or direct B cell attack on tumor cells. Notably, a high proportion of the IgG1 isotype is positively correlated with the non-silent mutation burden both in the general LUAD cohort and in most patient subgroups, supporting a role for IgG1 TIBs in antigen presentation. Complementing the recent finding that the presence of stromal IgG4-producing cells is associated with a favorable prognosis for patients with stage I squamous cell carcinoma, we show that the abundance of IgG4-producing TIBs likewise has a strong positive effect on overall survival in STK11 and proximal proliferative subgroups of LUAD patients. We hypothesize that the positive role of IgG4 antibodies in some of the lung cancer subtypes could be associated with reported inability of IgG4 isotype to form immune complexes, thus preventing immunosuppression via activation of the myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) phenotype.We discover prominent and distinct associations between TIBs antibody isotypes and survival in lung adenocarcinoma carrying specific driver mutations. These findings indicate that particular types of tumor-immunity relations could be beneficial in particular driver mutation context, which should be taken into account in developing strategies of cancer  and combination therapies. Specificity of protective B cell populations in specific cancer subgroups could become a clue to efficient targeted immunotherapies for appropriate cohorts of patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662531>T-Lymphocyte Activation Is Correlated With the Presence of Anti-EBV in Patients With Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Chronic viral infection is an important risk factor in the development of cancer. Failure of immune response to clear the oncogenic infection can facilitate cancer progression. The aim of the present study was to analyze early and late activation of T-lymphocytes related to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection by the expression of markers of activation (CD69, CD25) on the surface of T-lymphocytes (CD3, CD4, CD8) in patients bearing laryngeal cancer according to absence/presence immunoglobulin G antibodies to EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA1).Thirty-three patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LC) and 20 volunteers without cancer (control group) were enrolled in the study. Peripheral blood samples were collected from every individual. The markers of activation of T-lymphocytes were determined by flow cytometry, whereas commercial immunoenzymatic assay kits were used for detection of anti-viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM, anti-VCA IgG, and anti-EBNA1 IgG.Increased early activation of CD8 and CD4 T-lymphocytes was found in patients with LC. There was a significantly higher proportion of CD4 and CD8T-lymphocytes expressing CD69 antigen in patients with LC compared to the control group. The proportion of CD4 CD25 T-lymphocytes in patients with LC positive for anti-EBNA1 IgG and anti-VCA IgM was lower compared to patients without antibodies to VCA IgM.The dysfunction of immune response in larynx cancer patients could be associated with EBV infection.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Although tumor responses to MEK inhibition are rarely durable, MEK inhibitors have shown substantial activity and durable tumor regressions when combined with systemic immunotherapies in preclinical models of RAS-driven tumors. MEK inhibitors have been shown to potentiate anti-tumor T cell immunity, but little is known about the effects of MEK inhibition on other immune subsets, including B cells. We show here that treatment with a MEK inhibitor reduces B regulatory cells (Bregs) in vitro, and reduces the number of Bregs in tumor draining lymph nodes in a colorectal cancer model in vivo. MEK inhibition does not impede anti-tumor humoral immunity, and B cells contribute meaningfully to anti-tumor immunity in the context of MEK inhibitor therapy. Treatment with a MEK inhibitor is associated with improved T cell infiltration and an enhanced response to anti-PD1 . Together these data indicate that MEK inhibition may reduce Bregs while sparing anti-tumor B cell function, resulting in enhanced anti-tumor immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667924>Current management of patients with melanoma who are found to be sentinel node-positive.</a></h2><p>The results of the DeCOG-SLT and MSLT-II studies, published in 2016 and mid-2017, indicated no survival benefit from completion lymph node dissection (CLND) in melanoma patients with positive sentinel nodes (SNs). Subsequently, several studies have been published reporting a benefit of adjuvant systemic therapy in patients with stage III melanoma. The current study assessed how these findings influenced management of SN-positive patients in a dedicated melanoma treatment centre.SN-positive patients treated at Melanoma Institute Australia between July 2017 and December 2018 were prospectively identified. Surgeons completed a questionnaire documenting the management of each patient. Information on patients, primary tumours, SNs, further treatment and follow-up was collected from patient files, the institutional research database and pathology reports.During the 18-month study period, 483 patients underwent SN biopsy. A positive SN was found in 61 (13%). Two patients (3%) requested CLND because of anxiety about observation in view of unfavourable primary tumour and SN characteristics. The other 59 patients (97%) were followed with a four-monthly ultrasound examination of the relevant lymph node field(s). Two of them (3%) developed an isolated nodal recurrence after 4 and 11 months of follow-up. Fifty-seven patients (93%) were seen following the publication of the first two adjuvant systemic therapy studies in November 2017; 46 (81%) were referred to a medical oncologist to discuss adjuvant systemic therapy, which 32 (70%) chose to receive.At Melanoma Institute Australia most patients with an involved SN are now managed without CLND.

Such metrics have value in measuring the outcomes of conventional therapies, but may not be the most appropriate for new therapies. Immuno-oncology therapies offer a new approach to treating cancer by stimulating patients' immune systems to fight cancer. The value of these novel therapies has so far been assessed with traditional metrics, but the different ways in which immuno-oncology therapies work can mean the full value is not captured. Immuno-oncology therapies can produce longer survival times but this effect can be delayed or even preceded by an apparent phase of progression, which median survival or response rates may not reflect.

Absolute and percent change of each target lesion were quantified at each computed tomography scan using RECIST. Patterns of progression were predefined as systemic or mixed and were correlated with clinical outcomes.A total of 761 individual lesions from 214 patients with NSCLC and 290 lesions from 78 patients with MMRD carcinoma were examined. Individual target lesion responses aligned with best overall response of each patient (85% NSCLC and 93% MMRD lesions responded in patients with partial response/complete response). In responding patients, timing of response was uniform (73% NSCLC and 76% MMRD lesions responded synchronously), and deeper responses were associated with prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival. By contrast, at progression, mixed progression was common (45% of NSCLC and 53% of MMRD) and associated with improved survival compared with those who experienced systemic progression (NSCLC hazard ratio [HR], 0.58;  = .001; MMRD HR, 0.40;  = .07). Organ sites had differential responses, with lymph node and liver metastasis among the most and least responsive, respectively.Temporal-spatial patterns of response across individual metastases tend to be uniform, favoring the role of peripheral, clonally directed antitumor immunity as a key mediator of response to PD-1 blockade.

We previously identified a nephritogenic epitope, P14 (3), that could induce crescentic nephritis in WKY rats, and defined its core motif. Designing a modified peptide, replacing critical pathogenic residues with nonpathogenic ones (on the basis of homologous regions in 1NC1 chain of type IV collagen, known to be nonpathogenic), might provide a therapeutic option for anti-GBM GN.We synthesized a modified peptide, replacing a single amino acid, and injected it into 3-P14-immunized rats from day 0 (the early-treatment group) or a later-treatment group (from days 17 to 21). A scrambled peptide administrated with the same protocol served as a control.The modified peptide, but not the scrambled peptide, attenuated anti-GBM GN in both treatment groups, and halted further crescent formation even after disease onset. Kidneys from the modified peptide-treated rats exhibited reductions in IgG deposits, complement activation, and infiltration by T cells and macrophages. Treatment also resulted in an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile versus a proinflammatory profile for animals not receiving the modified peptide; it also reduced 3-P14-specific T cell activation, modulated T cell differentiation by decreasing Th17 cells and enhancing the ratio of Treg/Th17 cells, and inhibited binding of 3-P14 to antibodies and MHC II molecules.A modified peptide involving alteration of a critical motif in a nephritogenic T cell epitope alleviated anti-GBM GN in a rat model.

Surgery, chemo, and radiation therapy have been the only options available until today to combat this major problem. Chemotherapeutic drugs have been used for treatment for more than 50 years. Unfortunately, these drugs have inherent cytotoxicities and tumor cells have started inducing resistance against these drugs. Other common techniques such as surgery and radiotherapy have their own drawbacks. Therefore, such techniques are incompetent tools to alleviate the disease efficiently without any adverse effects. This scenario has inspired researchers to develop alternative techniques with enhanced therapeutic effects and minimal side effects. Such techniques include targeted therapy, liposomal therapy, hormonal therapy, and , etc. However, these therapies are expensive and not effective enough. Furthermore, researchers have conjugated therapeutic agents or drugs with different molecules, delivery vectors, and/or imaging modalities to combat such problems and enhance the therapeutic effect. This conjugation technique has led to the development of bioconjugation therapy, in which at least one molecule is of biological origin. These bioconjugates are the new therapeutic strategies, having prospective synergistic antitumor effects and have potency to overcome the complications being produced by chemo drugs. Herein, we provide an overview of various bioconjugates developed so far, as well as their classification, characteristics, and targeting approach for cancer.

However, in the case of advanced cSCC (acSCC), a multimodality approach also involving systemic therapies needs to be considered.One hundred and ninety-five patients diagnosed with acSCC (stages III and IV) treated in our centre between 2011 and 2018 were included. Patient and tumour characteristics along with treatment patterns were documented and analyzed. Descriptive analysis was performed and survival rates were estimated according to Kaplan-Meier and compared with the Log-rank test. Follow-up was defined as the time between diagnosis of advanced disease and last contact or death. All causes of death were considered as events.The median follow-up was 21 months [IQR = (10.0; 21.0)]. The median age at time of advanced disease diagnosis was 78 years [IQR = (72; 84)], with 40.5% of the patients in stage III and 59.5% in stage IV. One hundred and forty-five patients had resectable tumours. In this group the median overall survival (mOS) was 59 months (95% CI: 28.2-89.8), significantly higher than the mOS in patients with inoperable tumour [n = 50; mOS: 19 months (96% CI: 7-31, P <0.0001)].

To explain this heterogeneity, we sought to identify a composite signature predictive of insulin secretion, using a collaborative assay evaluation and analysis pipeline that incorporated multiple cellular and serum measures reflecting beta cell health and immune system activity. The ability to predict decline in insulin secretion would be useful for patient stratification for clinical trial enrollment or therapeutic selection. Analytes from 12 qualified assays were measured in shared samples from subjects newly diagnosed with T1D. We developed a computational tool to identify a composite panel associated with decline in insulin secretion over 2 years after diagnosis. The tool employs multiple filtering steps to reduce data dimensionality, incorporates error-estimation techniques including cross-validation and sensitivity analysis, and is flexible to assay type, clinical outcome and disease setting. Using this novel analytical tool, we identified a panel of immune markers that, in combination, are highly associated with loss of insulin secretion.

At the cellular level, these tumours are composed of a mixture of neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic cells, including tumour-associated macrophages and endothelial cells. Cerebral oedema is a near-universal occurrence in patients afflicted with glioblastoma and it is almost exclusively managed with the corticosteroid dexamethasone despite significant drawbacks associated with its use. Here, we demonstrate that dexamethasone blocks interleukin-1 production in both bone marrow-derived and brain resident macrophage populations following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and interferon gamma. Additionally, dexamethasone is shown to inhibit downstream effectors of interleukin-1 signalling in both macrophage populations. Co-culture of bone marrow-derived macrophages with organotypic tumour slices results in an upregulation of interleukin-1 cytokines, an effect that is absent in co-cultured microglia. Genetic ablation of interleukin-1 ligands or receptor in mice bearing RCAS/tv-a-induced platelet-derived growth factor B-overexpressing glioblastoma results in reduced oedema and partial restoration of the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, respectively; similar to results obtained with vascular endothelial growth factor neutralization. We establish that tumours from dexamethasone-treated mice exhibit reduced infiltration of cells of the myeloid and lymphoid compartments, an effect that should be considered during clinical trials for  in glioblastoma patients. Additionally, we emphasize that caution should be used when immune profiling and single-cell RNA sequencing data are interpreted from fresh glioblastoma patient samples, as nearly all patients receive dexamethasone after diagnosis. Collectively, this evidence suggests that interleukin-1 signalling inhibition and dexamethasone treatment share therapeutic efficacies and establishes interleukin-1 signalling as an attractive and specific therapeutic target for the management of glioblastoma-associated cerebral oedema.© The Author(s) (2019).

Moreover, due to the adhesive nature of TA assembly, CFZ-pTA-alb served as a reservoir of damage-associated molecular patterns released from dying tumor cells to activate dendritic cells. Upon intratumoral administration, CFZ-pTA-alb prolonged tumor retention of CFZ and showed consistently greater antitumor effects than cyclodextrin-solubilized CFZ (CFZ-CD) in B16F10 and CT26 tumor models. Unlike CFZ-CD, the locally injected CFZ-pTA-alb protected or enhanced CD8+ T cell population in tumors, helped develop splenocytes with tumor-specific interferon- response, and delayed tumor development on the contralateral side in immunocompetent mice (but not in athymic nude mice), which support that CFZ-pTA-alb contributed to activating antitumor immunity. This study demonstrates that sustained delivery of ICD inducers by TA-based nanocapsules is an effective way of translating local ICD induction to systemic antitumor immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651363>Systemic and local immunity following adoptive transfer of NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T cells in synovial sarcoma.</a></h2><p>Gene-modified autologous T cells expressing NY-ESO-1, an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor (TCR) reactive against the NY-ESO-1-specific HLA-A*02-restricted peptide SLLMWITQC (NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cells; GSK 794), have demonstrated clinical activity in patients with advanced synovial sarcoma (SS). The factors contributing to gene-modified T-cell expansion and the changes within the tumor microenvironment (TME) following T-cell infusion remain unclear. These studies address the immunological mechanisms of response and resistance in patients with SS treated with NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cells.Four cohorts were included to evaluate antigen expression and preconditioning on efficacy. Clinical responses were assessed by RECIST v1.1. Engineered T-cell persistence was determined by qPCR. Serum cytokines were evaluated by immunoassay. Transcriptomic analyses and immunohistochemistry were performed on tumor biopsies from patients before and after T-cell infusion. Gene-modified T-cells were detected within the TME via an RNAish assay.Responses across cohorts were affected by preconditioning and intra-tumoral NY-ESO-1 expression. Of the 42 patients reported (data cut-off 4June2018), 1 patient had a complete response, 14 patients had partial responses, 24 patients had stable disease, and 3 patients had progressive disease. The magnitude of gene-modified T-cell expansion shortly after infusion was associated with response in patients with high intra-tumoral NY-ESO-1 expression. Patients receiving a fludarabine-containing conditioning regimen experienced increases in serum IL-7 and IL-15. Prior to infusion, the TME exhibited minimal leukocyte infiltration; CD163 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were the dominant population. Modest increases in intra-tumoral leukocytes (≤5%) were observed in a subset of subjects at approximately 8 weeks. Beyond 8 weeks post infusion, the TME was minimally infiltrated with a TAM-dominant leukocyte infiltrate. Tumor-associated antigens and antigen presentation did not significantly change within the tumor post-T-cell infusion. Finally, NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T cells trafficked to the TME and maintained cytotoxicity in a subset of patients.Our studies elucidate some factors that underpin response and resistance to NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cell therapy. From these data, we conclude that a lymphodepletion regimen containing high doses of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide is necessary for SPEAR T-cell persistence and efficacy.

However, such clinical benefit is limited because of the insufficient reinvigoration of antitumor immunity with the drug alone; therefore, rational therapeutic combinations are required to improve its efficacy. In our preclinical study, we evaluated the antitumor effect of U3-1402, a human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3)-targeting antibody-drug conjugate, and its potential synergism with PD-1 inhibition. Using a syngeneic mouse tumor model that is refractory to anti-PD-1 therapy, treatment with U3-1402 exhibited an obvious antitumor effect via direct lysis of tumor cells. Disruption of tumor cells by U3-1402 enhanced the infiltration of innate and adaptive immune cells. Chemotherapy with exatecan derivative (Dxd: the drug payload of U3-1402) revealed that the enhanced antitumor immunity produced by U3-1402 was associated with the induction of alarmins including HMGB-1 via tumor-specific cytotoxicity. Notably, U3-1402 significantly sensitized the tumor to PD-1 blockade, as a combination of U3-1402 and the PD-1 inhibitor significantly enhanced antitumor immunity. Further, clinical analyses indicated that tumor-specific HER3 expression was frequently observed in patients with PD-1 inhibitor-resistant solid tumors. Overall, U3-1402 is a promising candidate as a partner of  for such patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659111>The Activity of Immune Checkpoint Inhibition in KRAS Mutated Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: A Single Centre Experience.</a></h2><p>KRAS mutation is the most frequent molecular alteration found in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is associated with a poor prognosis without available targeted therapy. Treatment options for NSCLC have been recently enriched by the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and data about their efficacy in patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC are discordant. This study assessed the routine efficacy of ICIs in advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC.All stage IV NSCLC patients treated in our institution from January 2016 to December 2017 with  were included in our analysis. We collected the status of KRAS and other mutations, as well as the type of ICI administered. We assessed four clinical outcomes: i) disease control rate (DCR), ii) partial response (PR), iii) progression-free survival (PFS) and iv) overall survival (OS).A total of 45 patients were initially identified but 7 were excluded due to insufficient clinical data, so 38 were included in the end. In the KRAS wild-type cohort, the DCR was 59% with 49% PR, while the PFS was 8.4 months and OS 16.8 months. Among KRAS mutated patients, results were more favourable, the DCR was 81%, with 62% PR. PFS was 13.6 months and OS was 18.5 months. The median follow-up was 24 months (17 to 34 months) and 7 patients were still on treatment at the time of analysis.Our data suggest that KRAS mutation is predictive of a superior response to . Furthermore, the lack of response of STK11 and KRAS co-mutated NSCLC patients to ICIs, is indeed negated by an additional TP53 mutation.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

How myeloid cells acquire the protumoral properties during tumorigenesis is poorly understood. We report here that the polarity protein TIPE2 (tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like 2) mediates the functional polarization of murine and human MDSCs by specifying their pro- and antitumoral properties. Tumor cells induced the expression of TIPE2 in Gr1CD11b cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS). TIPE2 in turn increased the expression of protumoral mediators such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β while inhibiting the expression of antitumoral mediators. Consequently, tumor growth in TIPE2-deficient mice was significantly diminished, and TIPE2-deficient MDSCs markedly inhibited tumor growth upon adoptive transfer. Pharmaceutical blockade of ROS inhibited TIPE2 expression in MDSCs and reduced tumor growth in mice. These findings indicate that TIPE2 plays a key role in the functional polarization of MDSCs and represents a new therapeutic target for cancer .© 2019 Yan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672626>Cationic Synthetic Long Peptides-Loaded Nanogels: An Efficient Therapeutic Vaccine formulation for induction of T-cell Responses.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have shown a high potency of protein-based vaccines for cell-mediated cancer . However, due to their poor cellular uptake, efficient immune responses with soluble protein antigens are often not observed. As a result of superior cellular uptake, nanogels loaded with antigenic peptides were investigated in this study as carrier systems for cancer . Different synthetic long peptides (SLPs) containing the CTL and CD4 T-helper (Help) epitopes were synthesized and covalently conjugated via disulfide bonds to the polymeric network of cationic dextran nanogels. Cationic nanogels with a size of 210 nm, positive zeta potential (+24 mV) and high peptide loading content (15%) showed triggered release of the loaded peptides under reducing conditions. An in vitro study demonstrated the capability of cationic nanogels to maturate dendritic cells (DCs). Importantly, covalently SLP-loaded nanogels adjuvanted with poly(I:C) showed superior CD8 T cell responses compared to soluble peptides and nanogel formulations with physically loaded peptides both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, covalently SLPs-loaded cationic nanogels are a promising system to provoke immune responses for therapeutic cancer vaccination.Copyright © 2019.

Studies show, however, that DC vaccine priming of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) requires the activity of endogenous DC, suggesting that exogenous DC stimulate anti-tumor immunity by transferring antigen (Ag) to endogenous DC. Such Ag transfer functions are most commonly ascribed to monocytes, implying that undifferentiated monocytes would function equally well as a vaccine modality and need not be differentiated to DC to be effective. Here, we used several murine cancer models to test the anti-tumor efficacy of undifferentiated monocytes loaded with protein or peptide Ag. Intravenously injected monocytes displayed anti-tumor activity superior to DC vaccines in several cancer models, including aggressive intracranial glioblastoma. Ag-loaded monocytes induced robust CTL responses via Ag transfer to splenic CD8+ DC in a manner independent of monocyte APC activity. Ag transfer required cell-cell contact and the formation of connexin 43-containing gap junctions between monocytes and DC. These findings demonstrate the existence of an efficient gap junction-mediated Ag transfer pathway between monocytes and CD8+ DC and suggest that administration of tumor Ag-loaded undifferentiated monocytes may serve as a simple and efficacious  for the treatment of human cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651174>PLGA Nanoparticles Co-Delivering siRNAs against Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 and Its Ligand Gene for Suppression of Colon Tumor Growth.</a></h2><p>Tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes highly express programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) that interacts with its ligand, programmed cell death protein ligand-1 (PD-L1) on tumors. PD-1/PD-L1 interactions cause functional exhaustion of effector T cells and impair antitumor immunity, allowing tumors to escape immune surveillance. In addition to such extrinsic interactions, tumors proliferate by transmitting intrinsic PD-L1 signals via mTOR pathway. Here, we simultaneously silenced PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on CTLs and colon tumors using PD-1 siRNA/PD-L1 siRNA-loaded PLGA nanoparticles and investigated functional activation of tumor-specific CTLs. When compared to a single PD-1 silencing on CTLs or a single PD-L1 silencing on tumors, co-silencing of PD-1/PD-L1 on CTLs and tumors more efficiently promoted effector functions of tumor-specific CTLs. Moreover, PD-L1-silenced tumors inhibited mTOR signaling and showed an antiproliferative response independently of adaptive immune response. Ultimately, systemic administration of PD-1 and PD-L1 siRNA via PLGA nanoparticles restored the effector functions of tumor-specific CTLs in MC38 tumor-bearing mice. Compared with antitumor effects of PD-1 or PD-L1 single silencing alone, co-silencing of PD-1 and PD-L1 showed more significant tumor growth suppression and long-term tumor inhibition in colon cancer.

In addition to well-recognized urticaria and anaphylaxis triggered by IgE antibody-mediated immune responses, there is an increasing recognition of cell-mediated disorders such as eosinophilic esophagitis and food protein-induced enterocolitis. Non-IgE-Mediated gastrointestinal food allergies are an heterogeneous group of food allergies in which there is an immune reaction against food but the primary pathogenesis is not a production of IgE and activation of mastcells and basophils. Those diseases tend to affect mainly the gastrointestinal tract and can present as acute (FPIES) or chronic reaction such as Celiac disease, Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE), Food Protein Induced Allergic Proctocolitis (FPIAP). The role of food allergy in Non-EoE gastrointestinal Eosinophilc disorders (Non-EoE EGID) is poorly defined. In some diseases like Celiac Disease and possibly EoE T cell seems to play a major role in initiating the immunological reaction against food, however in FPIES and FPIAP the mechanism of sensitization is not clear. Diagnosis require food challenges and/or endoscopies in most of the patients. Celiac disease have some validated biomarkers but none of the other Non-IgE mediated food allergies have such biomarkers that can be used for monitoring or diagnosis of the diseases.

However, the efficacy and safety of anti-programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody have not been fully elucidated in Chinese melanoma patients, who show high frequency of mucosal and acral melanoma subtypes; besides, the factors influencing the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody have not been evaluated broadly.Patients with advanced melanoma treated with regimens containing anti-PD-1 antibody from June 2016 to January 2019 were evaluated. Baseline characteristics and blood parameters were assessed, and outcome and adverse events were evaluated according to different regimens. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for univariate and multivariate analyses.A total of 51 patients with advanced melanoma were included in this study. The overall objective response rate (ORR) was 17.6%, the disease control rate was 58.5%, and the median time to progression was 5.2 months. The ORR of patients with PD-1 blockade-based combination therapy, without liver metastases and higher level of C-reactive protein (CRP) before PD-1 blockade, is higher than that of those not. Univariate analysis based on clinical features showed that ECOG scores, liver metastasis, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and CRP levels were the factors affecting time to progression (TTP). Multivariate analysis showed that elevated CRP before PD-1 blockade was an independent predictive factor for ORR of PD-1 blockade therapy (=0.009), while only Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score was an independent predictor for TTP (=0.032). The treatment was well tolerated in these cohort patients, and there was no treatment-related death.Anti-PD-1 antibody-containing regimen was safe and effective in Chinese patients with advanced melanoma, and elevated CRP and ECOG score were independent factors predicting the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy.Copyright © 2019 Lingdi Zhao et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652082>Bempegaldesleukin (NKTR-214): a CD-122-biased IL-2 receptor agonist for cancer .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657111>Combinatorial prediction of marker panels from single-cell transcriptomic data.</a></h2><p>Single-cell transcriptomic studies are identifying novel cell populations with exciting functional roles in various in vivo contexts, but identification of succinct gene marker panels for such populations remains a challenge.

During this procedure, autologous tissue is excised, relocated, and reattached using vascular anastomoses at the site of the extirpated breast. The period during which the tissue is ex vivo may allow genetic modification without any systemic exposure to the vector. Could such access be used to deliver therapeutic agents using the tissue flap as a vehicle? Such delivery may be more efficient than systemic treatment, in terms of oncological outcomes. The cytokine interferon gamma (IFNγ) has antitumor effects, but systemic toxicity that could be circumvented if its effect can be localized by delivery of the IFNγ gene via gene therapy to autologous tissue used for breast reconstruction, which then releases IFNγ and exerts anti-tumor effects. In a rat model of loco-regional recurrence (LRR) using both MADB-106-Luc and MAD-MB-231-Luc breast cancer cells, autologous tissue was transduced ex vivo with an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) encoding IFNγ. The therapeutic reconstruction released IFNγ at the LRR site and eliminated cancer cells, significantly decreased tumor burden (P<0.05), and increased survival by 33% (P<0.05) compared to sham reconstruction. Mechanistically, localized IFNγ  stimulated M1 macrophages to target cancer cells within the regional confines of the modified tumor environment.

These results suggest MW11-h317 as a therapeutic monoclonal antibody of PD-1 glycosylation-targeting which may become efficient alternative for cancer therapy.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653980>Immune subtyping of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma: a new biomarker and an immune shift during disease progression.</a></h2><p>Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma is an aggressive lymphoma that is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. Although some extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma patients have shown responses to immune checkpoint blockade, biomarkers for predicting extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma patient response to  have not yet been defined. To understand the tumor immune microenvironment, we analyzed the expression of 579 immune-related genes and characterized the immune cells using immunohistochemistries and in situ hybridization for EBER. Based on comprehensive analyses, we developed an immune subtyping model that classifies extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma patients into four tumor immune microenvironment subgroups using three immunohistochemical markers (FoxP3, PD-L1, and CD68). The four tumor immune microenvironment subgroups were named immune tolerance, immune evasion-A, immune evasion-B, and immune silenced. The immune tolerance group was characterized by high-Treg counts and was frequently observed in early stage, and nasal extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. The immune evasion group showed high cytotoxic T-cell counts and high PD-L1 expression but low Treg counts. In the immune-silenced group, almost all immune responses were exhausted, most patients were at an advanced stage, and had the poorest disease prognosis among the tumor immune microenvironment subgroups. In some patients (n = 3), a shift in the tumor immune microenvironment subgroup classification was observed in sequential biopsies. The response rate to pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, was 100% (1/1) in the immune tolerance group, 60% (3/5) in the immune evasion group, and 0% (0/5) in the immune-silenced group. We classified extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma into four tumor immune microenvironment subgroups using a new classification system. In conclusion, we propose that the tumor immune microenvironment of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma may change during disease progression and may serve as a useful biomarker for .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653572>Androgen Receptor Splice Variant, AR-V7, as a Biomarker of Resistance to Androgen Axis-Targeted Therapies in Advanced Prostate Cancer.</a></h2><p>Many therapeutic options are now available for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), including next-generation androgen receptor axis-targeted therapies (AATTs), , chemotherapy, and radioisotope therapies. No clear consensus has been reached for the optimal sequencing of treatments for patients with mCRPC, and few well-validated molecular markers exist to guide the treatment decisions for individual patients. The androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7), a splice variant of the androgen receptor mRNA resulting in the truncation of the ligand-binding domain, has emerged as a biomarker for resistance to AATT. AR-V7 expression in circulating tumor cells has been associated with poor outcomes in patients treated with second- and third-line AATTs. Clinically validated assays are now commercially available for the AR-V7 biomarker. In the present review of the current literature, we have summarized the biology of resistance to AATT, with a focus on the AR-V7; and the clinical studies that have validated AR-V7 expression as a strong independent predictor of a lack of clinical benefit from AATTs. Existing evidence has indicated that patients with AR-V7-positive mCRPC will have better outcomes if treated with taxane chemotherapy regimens rather than additional AATTs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

IL-33 is released from stressed or necrotic cells. Initially, IL-33 was described as an inducer of the humoral immune response, which activated Th2 cells and mast cells involved in modulating inflammation and allergic reactions. In addition, IL-33 acts as a stimulator of the Th1, NK, and CD8T cells, which induce a cytotoxic immune response against intracellular pathogens. It was recently discovered that this cytokine is involved in the development of cancer by performing both pro- and antitumor functions. IL-33 can directly affect tumor cells and provokes their proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Moreover, IL-33 stimulates carcinogenesis by remodeling the tumor microenvironment and inducing angiogenesis, thus contributing to the generation of immunosuppressive conditions. At the same time, IL-33 causes tumor infiltration with cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes and natural killers, which leads to cytolysis-mediated cancer cell death. This review describes the versatile role of the IL-33/ST2 cascade in the development of experimental and clinical tumors. In addition, we discuss the prospects for the application of IL-33 and ST2 as diagnostic biomarkers and targets for cancer .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659103>The FOXC2 Transcription Factor Promotes Melanoma Outgrowth and Regulates Expression of Genes Associated With Drug Resistance and Interferon Responsiveness.</a></h2><p>The FOXC2 transcription factor promotes the progression of several cancer types, but has not been investigated in the context of melanoma cells. To study FOXC2's influence on melanoma progression, we generated a FOXC2-deficient murine melanoma cell line and evaluated The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patient datasets.We compared tumor growth kinetics and RNA-seq/qRT-PCR gene expression profiles from wild-type versus FOXC2-deficient murine melanomas. We also performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of TCGA data to assess the influence of FOXC2 gene expression on melanoma patients' response to chemotherapy and .FOXC2 promotes melanoma progression and regulates the expression of genes associated with multiple oncogenic pathways, including the oxidative stress response, xenobiotic metabolism, and interferon responsiveness. FOXC2 expression in melanoma correlates negatively with patient response to chemotherapy and .FOXC2 drives a tumor-promoting gene expression program in melanoma and is a prognostic indicator of patient response to multiple cancer therapies.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Before its introduction in the market, nivolumab was made available to NSCLC patients through an expanded access program (EAP). Here we present the Italian cohort of patients with non-squamous NSCLC enrolled in a worldwide nivolumab EAP, with subgroup analyses involving elderly patients, patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases and patients receiving nivolumab beyond progression.Pretreated patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC received nivolumab at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks up to 24 months. Efficacy data (investigator-assessed tumour response, progression date and survival) and safety data were collected.1588 patients were treated across 153 Italian centres. Overall response rate and disease control rate were 18% and 44%, respectively; median overall survival (OS) was 11.3 months (95% CI: 10.2-12.4). Elderly patients (≥70 n = 522; ≥75 n = 232) achieved outcomes similar to the global study population; patients with CNS metastases (n = 409) had an OS of 8.6 months (95% CI: 6.4-10.8), and a 1-year OS rate of 43%. Nivolumab was administered beyond progression to 276 patients (26%), 57 of whom achieved subsequent disease control; the median OS of patients receiving nivolumab beyond progression was 16.2 months (95% CI: 14.0-18.4), while 1-year OS rate was 62%.To date, this is the largest clinical experience with nivolumab in a real-world setting. Our data support its use in clinical practice for pretreated non-squamous NSCLC, including patients with older age or CNS metastases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, lack of effect in some patients made it imperative to identify other pathways that are exploited by cancer cells to circumvent immune surveillance, and possibly synergize immune checkpoint treatment in those cases. It has been recently recognized that adenosine levels increase significantly in the tumor microenvironment and that adenosine/adenosine receptors play a powerful role as immunosuppressive and attenuating several effector T cell functions. The two main enzymes responsible for generating adenosine in the microenvironment are the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73, the former utilizes both ATP and ADP and produces AMP while the latter utilizes AMP and generates adenosine. Thus, these two enzymes combined are the major source for the bulk of adenosine produced in the microenvironment. They were shown to be validated targets in oncology leading to several clinical trials that include small molecules as well as antibodies, showing positive and encouraging results in the preclinical arena. Towards the development of novel drugs to target these enzymes, we have developed a platform that can be utilized to monitor the activities of both enzymes in vitro (biochemical) as well as in cells (cell based) assays. We have developed very sensitive and homogenous assays that enabled us to monitor the activity of both enzymes and demonstrate selectivity of known inhibitors as well as monoclonal antibodies. This should speed up screening for novel inhibitors that might lead to more effective cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659314>Teamwork by different T-cell types boosts tumour destruction by .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668650>Anti-PD-1  in advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: A long-awaited breakthrough finally arrives.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658426>CD103 T and Dendritic Cells Indicate a Favorable Prognosis in Oral Cancer.</a></h2><p>T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) that are positive for the tissue-resident marker CD103 play a vital role in antitumor immunity. In this study, multiplexed immunohistochemistry was applied to stain CD103 and the T-cell marker CD8 as well as the DC marker CD11c on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tissues. Then, the density of CD103CD8 and CD103CD11c tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the intratumoral and stromal regions was calculated, and the correlation of CD103CD8 TIL and CD103CD11c TIL density with OSCC patient prognosis was analyzed. The results revealed that CD103CD8 TILs and CD103CD11c TILs were abundant in the stromal region and that increased stromal CD103CD8 TIL and intratumoral CD103CD11c TIL density indicated a favorable prognosis.

Nearly 80% of the lower-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas harbor recurrent mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (). Mutant IDH generates high levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) that inhibit various components of the epigenetic machinery, including histone and DNA demethylases. The encouraging results from current epigenetic therapies in hematological malignancies have reinvigorated the interest in solid tumors and gliomas, both preclinically and clinically. Here, we summarize the recent advancements in epigenetic therapy for lower-grade gliomas and discuss the challenges associated with current treatment options. A particular focus is placed on therapeutic mechanisms underlying favorable outcome with epigenetic-based drugs in basic and translational research of gliomas. This review also highlights emerging bridges to combination treatment with respect to epigenetic drugs. Given that epigenetic therapies, particularly DNA methylation inhibitors, increase tumor immunogenicity and antitumor immune responses, appropriate drug combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors may lead to improvement of treatment effectiveness of , ultimately leading to tumor cell eradication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655499>Assessment of Treatment Efficacy of Diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP) for Alopecia Areata.</a></h2><p>Background and Objectives Alopecia areata is an inflammatory disease with a genetic and autoimmune basis. We aimed to study the efficacy, and safety of an immunomodulatory therapeutic agent, diphenylcyclopropenone, while manifesting the association with histopathological features, prognostic factors and side effects. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 98 patients (60 men, 38 women) with alopecia who were referred to the ?Hair Disease Polyclinic? at Department of Dermatology between 2011 and 2015 were included. Together with medical histories and dermatological examinations, all patients were taken a skin biopsy for histopathological examination prior to the therapy. Therapeutic success was evaluated on the basis of hair re-growth percentage. Results Regarding the overall treatment success, 33 (34%) patients had complete response, 16 (16%) patients had partial response (between 50-99%), 27 (28%) patients had minimal response (between 1-49%), and 22 (22%) patients were non-responders. Both genders were equally represented in the outcome. Conclusions There was a significant relation between the severity of alopecia and treatment outcome. (p=0.038) Patients with alopecia areata had significantly better response when compared to alopecia totalis and universalis. There was no statistically significant relation with other parameters such as disease duration, age, gender, atopy history, age of onset, and histopathological features.</p></html>
