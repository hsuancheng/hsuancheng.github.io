IL-9 is a pleiotropic cytokine that we previously found to be highly expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with IS, and the presence of IL-9 receptors on astrocytes has been reported in the literature. Here, we detected the effect of IL-9 on astrocytes using an anti-IL-9-neutralizing antibody to treat rats with experimental stroke. Supernatants from astrocytes treated with or without oxygen-glucose deprivation and/or IL-9 were incubated with bEnd.3 cell monolayers after blocking the IL-9 receptor on the endothelium. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analyses were conducted to observe the change in  proteins (TJPs) in bEnd.3 cells as well as the level of VEGF-A and possible signal pathways in astrocytes. We also applied middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) models to determine the effect of anti-IL-9-neutralizing antibodies on IS. As a result, astrocyte-conditioned medium treated with IL-9 aggravated the disruption of the BBB accomplished by the degradation of TJPs in endothelial cells. In addition, IL-9 increased the level of VEGF-A in astrocytes, and blocking the effect of VEGF-A reversed the breakdown of the BBB. In the MCAO model, anti-IL-9-neutralizing antibody reduced the infarct volume and BBB destruction. Mechanistically, the anti-IL-9-neutralizing antibody repaired the damaged TJPs (zonula occludens 1, occludin, and claudin-5) and induced a decrease in VEGF-A expression in ischemic lateral brain tissue. In contrast, a local injection of recombinant murine IL-9 to the brain resulted in a marked up-regulation of VEGF-A in the striatum. In conclusion, anti-IL-9-neutralizing antibody can reduce the severity of IS partially by alleviating the destruction of the BBB via down-regulation of astrocyte-derived VEGF-A. This finding suggests that targeting IL-9 or VEGF-A could provide a new direction for the treatment of IS.-Tan, S., Shan, Y., Lin, Y., Liao, S., Zhang, ., Zeng, Q., Wang, Y., Deng, Z., Chen, C., Hu, X., Peng, L., Qiu, W., Lu, Z.

One major hallmark of blast neurotrauma is glial reactivity, notably prolonged astrocyte activation. This cellular response has been mainly defined in primary blast neurotrauma by increased intermediate filament expression. Because the intermediate filament networks physically interface with transmembrane proteins for junctional support, it was hypothesized that cell  regulation is altered in the reactive phenotype as well. This would have implications for downstream transcriptional regulation via signal transduction pathways like nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells (NF-κ). Therefore, a custom high-rate overpressure simulator was built for  testing using mechanical conditions based on intracranial pressure measurements in a rat model of blast neurotrauma. Primary rat astrocytes were exposed to isolated high-rate mechanical stimulation to study cell  dynamics in relation to their mechano-activation. First, a time course for "classical" features of reactivity was devised by evaluation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression. This was followed by gene and protein expression for both gap  (connexins) and anchoring  proteins (integrins and cadherins). Signal transduction analysis was carried out by nuclear localization of two molecules, NF-κ p65 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38. Results indicated significant increases in connexin-43 expression and PCNA first at 24 h post-overpressure ( < 0.05), followed by structural reactivity (via increased GFAP,  < 0.05) corresponding to increased anchoring  dynamics at 48 h post-overpressure ( < 0.05). Moreover, increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was observed in addition to increased nuclear localization of both p65 and p38 ( < 0.05) during the period of structural reactivity. To evaluate the transcriptional activity of p65 in the nucleus, electrophoretic mobility shift assay was conducted for a binding site on the promoter region for intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), an antagonist of . A significant increase in the interaction of nuclear proteins with the NF-κ site on the ICAM-1 corresponded to increased gene and protein expression of ICAM-1 ( < 0.05). Altogether, these results indicate multiple targets and corresponding signaling pathways which involve cell  dynamics in the mechano-activation of astrocytes following high-rate overpressure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636641>β-Defensin 129 Attenuates Bacterial Endotoxin-Induced Inflammation and Intestinal Epithelial Cell Apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Defensins have attracted considerable research interest worldwide because of their potential to serve as a substitute for antibiotics. In this study, we characterized a novel porcine β-defensin (pBD129) and explored its role in alleviating bacterial endotoxin-induced inflammation and intestinal epithelium atrophy. The  gene was cloned and expressed in . A recombinant pBD129 protein was also purified. To explore its role in alleviating the endotoxin-induced inflammation, mice, with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge were treated by pBD129 at different doses. The recombinant pBD129 showed significant antimicrobial activities against the  and  with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) of 32 μg/mL. Hemolytic assays showed that the pBD129 had no detrimental impact on cell viabilities. Interestingly, we found that pBD129 attenuated LPS-induced inflammatory responses by decreasing serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, such as the IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α ( < 0.05). Moreover, pBD129 elevated the intestinal villus height ( < 0.05) and enhanced the expression and localization of the major -associated protein ZO-1 in LPS-challenged mice. Additionally, pDB129 at a high dose significantly decreased serum diamine oxidase (DAO) concentration ( < 0.05) and reduced intestinal epithelium cell apoptosis ( < 0.05) in LPS-challenged mice. Importantly, pBD129 elevated the expression level of Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bcl-2), but down-regulated the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes such as the -cell lymphoma-2-associated X protein (Bax), BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid), cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase-3 (Caspase-3), and caspase-9 in the intestinal mucosa ( < 0.05). These results suggested a novel function of the mammalian defensins, and the anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties of pBD129 may allow it a potential substitute for conventionally used antibiotics or drugs.Copyright © 2019 Xie, Xie, Su, Chen, Yu, Mao, Huang, Yu, Luo, Zheng, Luo and He.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29920328>Lack of junctional adhesion molecule (JAM)- ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.</a></h2><p>In multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) autoaggressive CD4 T cells cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and cause neuroinflammation. Therapeutic targeting of CD4 T-cell trafficking into the CNS by blocking α4-integrins has proven beneficial for the treatment of MS but comes with associated risks, probably due to blocking CD8 T cell mediated CNS immune surveillance. Our recent observations show that CD8 T cells also rely on α4β1-integrins to cross the BBB. Besides vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), we identified junctional adhesion molecule- (JAM-) as a novel vascular α4β1-integrin ligand involved in CD8 T-cell migration across the BBB. This prompted us to investigate, if JAM- also mediates CD4 T-cell migration across the BBB. We first ensured that encephalitogenic T cells can bind to JAM- in vitro and next compared EAE pathogenesis in JAM- C57BL/6J mice and their wild-type littermates. Following immunization with MOG peptide, JAM- mice developed ameliorated EAE compared to their wild-type littermates. At the same time, we isolated higher numbers of CD45 infiltrating immune cells from the CNS of JAM- C57BL/6J mice suffering from EAE. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that the majority of CD45 inflammatory cells accumulated in the leptomeningeal and perivascular spaces of the CNS behind the BBB but do not gain access to the CNS parenchyma. Trapping of CNS inflammatory cells was not due to increased inflammatory cell proliferation. Neither a loss of BBB integrity or BBB polarity potentially affecting local chemokine gradients nor a lack of focal gelatinase activation required for CNS parenchymal immune cell entry across the glia limitans could be detected in JAM- mice. Lack of a role for JAM- in the effector phase of EAE was supported by the observation that we did not detect any role for JAM- in EAE pathogenesis, when EAE was elicited by in vitro activated MOG specific CD4 effector T cells. On the other hand, we also failed to demonstrate any role of JAM- in in vivo priming, proliferation or polarization of MOG-specific CD4 T cells in peripheral immune organs. Finally, our study excludes expression of and thus a role for JAM- on peripheral and CNS infiltrating myeloid cells. Taken together, although endothelial JAM- is not required for immune cell trafficking across the BBB in EAE, in its absence accumulation of inflammatory cells mainly in CNS leptomeningeal spaces leads to amelioration of EAE.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The specific molecular components that define the normal adult human BNB are not fully known. Guided by data derived from the adult human BNB transcriptome, we evaluated the in situ expression of 25 junctional complex, transporter, cell membrane, and cytoskeletal proteins in four histologically normal adult sural nerves by indirect fluorescent immunohistochemistry to determine proteins specifically expressed by restrictive endoneurial microvascular endothelium. Using Ulex Europaeus Agglutinin-1 expression to detect endothelial cells, we ascertained that the selected proteins were uniformly expressed in ≥90% of endoneurial microvessels. P-glycoprotein (also known as adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily  member 1) and solute carrier family 1 member 1 demonstrated restricted expression by endoneurial endothelium only, with classic  protein claudin-5 also expressed on fenestrated epineurial macrovessels, and vascular-specific adherens  protein cadherin-5 also expressed by the perineurium. The expression profiles of the selected proteins provide significant insight into the molecular composition of normal adult peripheral nerves. Further work is required to elucidate the human adult BNB molecular signature in order to better understand its development and devise strategies to restore function in peripheral neuropathies.© 2019 Peripheral Nerve Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30138657>COX-2/EP2-EP4/β-catenin signaling regulates patulin-induced intestinal cell proliferation and inflammation.</a></h2><p>Patulin (PAT), a mycotoxin, is a natural contaminant that is produced by certain species of Penicillium, Aspergillus and Byssochlamys. The major contamination of PAT is in apple and apple based products. PAT is known to cause glutathione depletion, oxidative DNA damage and cell proliferation. Recently, in vitro studies have indicated that PAT can also increase the intestinal epithelial permeability, modulate  and decrease transepithelial electrical resistance. Nonetheless, no previous study has evaluated the mechanisms responsible for PAT-induced intestinal toxicity or its relevance to the in vivo situation. Here, Wistar rats were orally treated with 100 μg/kg body weight (.wt.) of PAT, either alone or along with 100 mg/kg . wt. of celecoxib for 3 days. We found that PAT exposure led to significantly higher levels of PGE in serum and intestinal tissue and high expression of COX-2 and Ki-67 compared to controls. Interestingly, our results showed that celecoxib treatment could decrease the PAT-induced PGE and reduce the PAT-induced intestinal damage. To study the mechanistic aspect, normal rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) were treated with non-toxic concentrations (100 nM, 250 nM and 500 nM) of PAT for 6 h. It was observed that PAT exposure caused enhanced proliferation, higher expression of COX-2, and EP2 and EP4 receptors, along with increased PGE secretion. Additionally, PAT exposure caused enhanced Akt expression, which in turn inhibits GSK-3β and stabilizes β-catenin. Overall, our study suggests that the COX-2/EP2-EP4/β-catenin signaling cascades are involved in the regulation of PAT-induced intestinal cell proliferation and inflammation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The pathology of CDI stems primarily from the 2 C. difficile-secreted exotoxins-toxin A (TcdA) and toxin  (TcdB)-that disrupt the  between epithelial cells leading to the loss of colonic epithelial barrier function. Here, we report the engineering of a series of monomeric and dimeric designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) for the neutralization of TcdB. The best dimeric DARPin, DLD-4, inhibited TcdB with a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 4 pM in vitro, representing an approximately 330-fold higher potency than the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anti-TcdB monoclonal antibody bezlotoxumab in the same assay. DLD-4 also protected mice from a toxin challenge in vivo. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies revealed that the 2 constituent DARPins of DLD-4-1.4E and U3-bind the central and C-terminal regions of the delivery domain of TcdB. Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) studies showed that the DARPins 1.4E and U3 interfere with the interaction between TcdB and its receptors chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) and frizzled class receptor 2 (FZD2), respectively. Our cryo-EM studies revealed a new conformation of TcdB (both apo- and DARPin-bound at pH 7.4) in which the combined repetitive oligopeptides (CROPS) domain points away from the delivery domain. This conformation of the CROPS domain is in stark contrast to that seen in the negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) structure of TcdA and TcdB at the same pH, in which the CROPS domain bends toward and "kisses" the delivery domain. The ultrapotent anti-TcdB molecules from this study serve as candidate starting points for CDI drug development and provide new biological tools for studying the pathogenicity of C. difficile. The structural insights regarding both the "native" conformation of TcdB and the putative sites of TcdB interaction with the FZD2 receptor, in particular, should help accelerate the development of next-generation anti-C. difficile toxin therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30575775>IL-33, IL-25 and TSLP contribute to development of fungal-associated protease-induced innate-type airway inflammation.</a></h2><p>Certain proteases derived from house dust mites and plants are considered to trigger initiation of allergic airway inflammation by disrupting  between epithelial cells. It is known that inhalation of proteases such as house dust mite-derived Der p1 and/or papaya-derived papain caused airway eosinophilia in naïve mice and even in Rag-deficient mice that lack acquired immune cells such as T,  and NKT cells. In contrast, little is known regarding the possible involvement of proteases derived from Aspergillus species (fungal-associated proteases; FAP), which are ubiquitous saprophytic fungi in the environment, in the development of allergic airway eosinophilia. Here, we found that inhalation of FAP by naïve mice led to airway eosinophilia that was dependent on protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2), but not TLR2 and TLR4. Those findings suggest that the protease activity of FAP, but not endotoxins in FAP, are important in the setting. In addition, development of that eosinophilia was mediated by innate immune cells (ILCs) such as innate lymphoid cells, but not by acquired immune cells such as T,  and NKT cells. Whereas IL-33, IL-25 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) are involved in induction of FAP-induced ILC-mediated airway eosinophilia, IL-33-rather than IL-25 and/or TSLP-was critical for the eosinophilia in our model. Our findings improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in induction of airway inflammation by FAP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981282>Dysregulation of sonic hedgehog pathway and pericytes in the brain after lentiviral infection.</a></h2><p>Impairment of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been associated with cognitive decline in many CNS diseases, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Recent research suggests an important role for the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway in the maintenance of BBB integrity under both physiological and pathological conditions.In the present study, we sought to examine the expression of Shh and its downstream effectors in relation to brain pericytes and BBB integrity in HIV-infected humans and rhesus macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), an animal model of HIV infection and CNS disease. Cortical brain tissues from uninfected (n = 4) and SIV-infected macaques with (SIVE, n = 6) or without encephalitis (SIVnoE, n = 4) were examined using multi-label, semi-quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy of Shh, netrin-1,  protein zona occludens 1 (ZO1), glial fibrillary acidic protein, CD163, platelet-derived growth factor receptor  (PDGFRB), glucose transporter 1, fibrinogen, and SIV Gag p28.While Shh presence in the brain persisted during HIV/SIV infection, both netrin-1 immunoreactivity and the size of PDGFRB+ pericytes, a cellular source of netrin-1, were increased around non-lesion-associated vessels in encephalitis compared to uninfected brain or brain without encephalitis, but were completely absent in encephalitic lesions. Hypertrophied pericytes were strongly localized in areas of fibrinogen extravasation and showed the presence of intracellular SIVp28 and HIVp24 by immunofluorescence in all SIV and HIV encephalitis cases examined, respectively.The lack of pericytes and netrin-1 in encephalitic lesions, in line with downregulation of ZO1 on the fenestrated endothelium, suggests that pericyte loss, despite the strong presence of Shh, contributes to HIV/SIV-induced BBB disruption and neuropathogenesis in HAND.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29912589>Lactobacillus plantarum prevents and mitigates alcohol-induced disruption of colonic epithelial , endotoxemia, and liver damage by an EGF receptor-dependent mechanism.</a></h2><p>Pathogenesis of alcohol-related diseases such as alcoholic hepatitis involves gut barrier dysfunction, endotoxemia, and toxin-mediated cellular injury. Here we show that Lactobacillus plantarum not only blocks but also mitigates ethanol (EtOH)-induced gut and liver damage in mice. L. plantarum blocks EtOH-induced protein thiol oxidation, and down-regulation of antioxidant gene expression in colon L. plantarum also blocks EtOH-induced expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 ( MCP1), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand ( CXCL)1, and CXCL2 genes in colon. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling mediates the L. plantarum-mediated protection of  (TJs) and barrier function from acetaldehyde, the EtOH metabolite, in Caco-2 cell monolayers. In mice, doxycycline-mediated expression of dominant negative EGFR blocks L. plantarum-mediated prevention of EtOH-induced TJ disruption, mucosal barrier dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response in colon. L. plantarum blocks EtOH-induced endotoxemia as well as EtOH-induced pathologic lesions, triglyceride deposition, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses in the liver by an EGFR-dependent mechanism. L. plantarum treatment after injury accelerated recovery from EtOH-induced TJ, barrier dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response in colon, endotoxemia, and liver damage. Results demonstrate that L. plantarum has both preventive and therapeutic values in treatment of alcohol-induced tissue injury, particularly in alcoholic hepatitis.-Shukla, P. K., Meena, A.

Aim of the study was to investigate the role of epithelial adherence and  molecules expressed by human endometrium in predicting womens' fertility outcome. A total of 76 consecutive women, including 24 fertile (G1), 40 primary infertile (G2), and 12 recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL, G3) women, who underwent diagnostic hysteroscopy plus endometrial biopsy between 2005 and 2016 at the Gynecology Division of Sant'Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome, in Italy, were retrospectively identified and included into the study. Endometrial biopsies were assessed for the immunohistochemical expression of beta-catenin (β-catenin), E-cadherin and K-cadherin biomarkers. Expression profiles were compared between the three groups of patients and were correlated with patients' fertility outcome. In infertile patients there was a significant lower endometrial expression of β-catenin ( = .001), E-cadherin ( = .001) and K-cadherin ( = .002), compared to the fertile ones. Furthermore, β-catenin and E-cadherin intensity gradients of expression at glandular level were found totally reversed in infertile patients. Significant lower expression levels of K-catenin ( = .016) and E-cadherin ( < .0001) at glandular level were found in RPL patients. Results showed that the low endometrial expression of β-catenin, E-cadherin and K-cadherin were associated to fertility-related problems, such as primary intertility and RPL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30088235>TLR2 Ligand Pam3CSK4 Regulates MMP-2/9 Expression by MAPK/NF-κ Signaling Pathways in Primary Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells.</a></h2><p>Blood-brain barrier (BBB) destruction is associated with a variety of neurological diseases. Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) are the key constituent of BBB. Both matrix metalloproteinases-2/9 (MMP-2/9) and toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) are coexpressed in BMECs and have been shown to play important roles in BBB breakdown. It is unknown whether TLR2 can regulate MMP-2/9 in BMECs. In this study, Pam3CSK4 was used to activate TLR2, and the expression of MMP-2/9 and  (TJs) in BBB was measured by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. Phosphoproteins were determined by western blotting. The inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and NF-κ were used to identify the signaling pathways by which TLR2 regulates the expression of MMP-2/9 in BMECs. This study showed that Pam3CSK4 upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of MMP-9 and downregulated MMP-2 and TJ expression in BMECs simultaneously. Pam3CSK4 also induced the phosphorylation of MAPKs and NF-κ signaling pathways in BMECs. MMP-9 expression was found to decrease by pretreatment with inhibitors of ERK1/2 and JNK but not p38. However, the mRNA and protein expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 increased after addition of a NF-κ inhibitor. Our results indicated that Pam3CSK4 was able to upregulate MMP-9 expression through ERK1/2 and JNK signaling pathways, but the NF-κ signaling pathway negatively regulated the effect of TLR2 on MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in BMECs. The finding provides novel insight into the molecular mechanism of MMP-2/9 expression in BMECs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406920>Cilostazol against 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis: Effect on , inflammation, and apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases are immunologically mediated disorders of gastrointestinal tract, characterized by dysregulated immune responses that result in a chronic intestinal inflammation. The antiplatelet cilostazol (CS), a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor, exerted a beneficial effect on several models of gastrointestinal diseases; however, the full mechanism of action in this context has not been unveiled.The current study aimed to elucidate the potential role of CS in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis model.Male Wistar rats were divided into a sham group and groups treated with sulfasalazine (500 mg/kg), CS (50 and 100 mg/kg), and a combination (sulfasalazine/CS 50 mg/kg). All treatments were administered orally 15 days, with TNBS rectal administration on the 11th day.TNBS-produced colitis manifested as a decrease in the epithelial junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) and as an increase in trefoil factor-3, ulcerative area, and colon mass index, parameters that collaborate with the gross macroscopic changes in colon tissue. In addition, TNBS increased hemeoxygenase-1, nuclear factor-kappa , P-selectin, and myeloperoxidase, as well as the apoptotic ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. Administration of CS alone, especially at the high dose level, attenuated the severity of TNBS-induced colitis in a sulfasalazine-comparable manner. In addition, a better effect was mediated by the combination regimen, which succeeded in normalizing most of the measured parameters.CS protected the colon against TNBS through its anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects along with maintaining cellular  (TJs).

Few studies have implemented an epigenome-wide approach. Using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450K), we investigated epigenome-wide placental DNA methylation in relation to maternal experiences of traumatic and non-traumatic stressors over her lifetime assessed using the Life Stressor Checklist-Revised (LSC-R) survey (n = 207). We found differential DNA methylation at epigenome-wide statistical significance (FDR = 0.05) for 112 CpGs. Additionally, we observed three clusters that exhibited differential methylation in response to high maternal lifetime stress. Enrichment analyses, conducted at an FDR = 0.20, revealed lysine degradation to be the most significant pathway associated with maternal lifetimes stress exposure. Targeted enrichment analyses of the three largest clusters of probes, identified using the gap statistic, were enriched for genes associated with endocytosis (i.e., SMAP1, ANKFY1),  (i.e., EPB41L4B), and metabolic pathways (i.e., INPP5E, EEF1B2). These pathways, also identified in the top 10 KEGG pathways associated with maternal lifetime stress exposure, play important roles in multiple physiological functions necessary for proper fetal development. Further, two genes were identified to exhibit multiple probes associated with maternal lifetime stress (i.e., ANKFY1, TM6SF1). The methylation status of the probes belonging to each cluster and/or genes exhibiting multiple hits, may play a role in the pathogenesis of adverse health outcomes in children born to mothers with increased lifetime stress exposure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195365>Navy bean supplemented high-fat diet improves intestinal health, epithelial barrier integrity and critical aspects of the obese inflammatory phenotype.</a></h2><p>Obesity is associated with impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function and an altered microbiota community structure, which contribute to host systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Fiber-rich common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) promote intestinal health (microbiota and host epithelial barrier integrity) in lean mice. The objective was to assess the intestinal health promoting effects of navy bean supplementation during high-fat (HF)diet-induced obesity. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a high-fat (HF) diet (60% of kcal from fat) or an isocaloric HF diet supplemented with 15.7% (by weight) cooked navy bean powder (HF+) for 12 weeks. Compared to HF, the HF+ diet altered the fecal microbiota community structure (16S rRNA gene sequencing), most notably increasing abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila (+19-fold), whose abundance typically decreases in obese humans and rodents. Additionally, HF+ fecal abundance of carbohydrate fermenting, short chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing Prevotella (+332-fold) and S24-7 (+1.6-fold) and fecal SCFA levels were increased. HF+ improved intestinal health and epithelial barrier integrity versus HF, evidenced by reduced serum fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran concentration in an in vivo gut permeability test, and increased intestinal mRNA expression of  components (ZO-1, occludin), anti-microbial defenses (Reg3γ, IgA, Defα5, Defβ2) and mucins (Muc2). Additionally, HF+ improved the systemic obese phenotype via reduced serum HOMA-IR and leptin:adiponectin ratio, and locally via attenuation of epididymal adipose tissue crown-like structure formation, adipocyte size, and inflammatory transcription factor (NFκBp65 and STAT3) activation. Therefore, navy bean supplementation improved obese intestinal health (microbiota and epithelial barrier integrity) and attenuated the severity of the obese phenotype.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, this protective function is the major hurdle for treating brain diseases such as brain tumors, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, etc. It was previously demonstrated that high pulsed electrical fields (PEFs) can disrupt the BBB by inducing electroporation (EP) which increases the permeability of the transcellular route. Our goal was to study the effects of low PEFs, well below the threshold of EP on the integrity and function of the BBB. Ten low voltage pulses (5-100 V) were applied to a human in vitro BBB model. Changes in permeability to small molecules (NaF) were studied as well as changes in impedance spectrum and trans-endothelial electric resistivity. Viability and EP were evaluated by Presto-Blue and endogenous Lactate dehydrogenase release assays. The effect on  and adherent  protein was also studied. The results of low voltage experiments were compared to high voltage experiments (200-1400 V). A significant increase in permeability was found at voltages as low as 10 V despite EP only occurring from 100 V. The changes in permeability as a function of applied voltage were fitted to an inverse-exponential function, suggesting a plateau effect. Staining of VE-cadherin showed specific changes in protein expression. The results indicate that low PEFs can transiently disrupt the BBB by affecting the paracellular route, although the mechanism remains unclear.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29960082>Monitoring changing cellular characteristics during the development of a fin cell line from Cyprinus carpio.</a></h2><p>The establishment and in-depth characterization of a novel continuous cell line derived from fin tissue of common carp (Cyprinus carpio), CCApin, is reported. The cells of the cell line could be propagated in Leibovitz's L-15 medium containing 15% foetal calf serum and 0.5% carp serum for >150 passages during the last 24 months, with a stable fast growth. Furthermore, antibody staining indicated that cell types obtained in primary cultures, containing the epithelial stem-cell marker tumorprotein 63, were different from cells in long-term cell cultures, containing  protein zona occludens 1 and cytokeratin 7. These observations suggest a switch of dominant cell types. Molecular analysis of gene expression profiles of caudal fin tissue and CCApin cells showed that genes relevant in epithelial cells but also in mesenchymal cells were expressed. However, during cultivation of CCApin a set of very steadily expressed, primarily mesenchymal genes like collagen 1 alpha 1, fibronectin or cadherin 2 was found. In summary, the long-term cell culture could be described as a stably growing epithelial population with some mesenchymal features. There are several application possibilities, especially for virus susceptibility studies, e.g. cyprinid herpesvirus-3 (CyHV-3). The study leads to a better understanding of molecular and physiological mechanisms of in vitro fish cell cultures.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, to our knowledge, no study has specifically addressed the potential protective effects of AST against bovine endometritis. The purpose of this study was to examine whether treatment with AST could protect endometrial epithelial cells against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory injury. Treatment of bovine endometrial epithelial cell line (BEND) with AST reduced LPS-induced production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), increased the cellular activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), decreased the proportion of apoptotic cells, and promoted the production of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and epithelial growth factor (EGF). The effects of AST were mediated through the downregulation of Bcl-2 associated X, apoptosis regulator (Bax), and cleaved caspase-3 and through the upregulation of -cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). Moreover, AST significantly increased the expression of the  proteins claudin, cadherin-1 (CDH1), and  protein 1 (TJP1), which play an essential role in the maintenance of host endometrial defense barrier against pathogen infection. Collectively, these results demonstrated that treatment with AST protected against oxidative stress, prevented cell apoptosis, promoted BEND cells viability, and increased the production of growth factors, in addition to activating the endometrial defense barrier. Therefore, AST is a promising therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of endometritis. This finding is of utmost importance in the present times when the excessive use of antibiotics has resulted in the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.© The Author(s) 2019.

The striatin protein family, which are part of the striatin interaction phosphatases and kinases complex, are multidomain scaffolding proteins that play important biologic roles. We have previously shown that striatin colocalizes with the tumor suppressor protein adenomatous polyposis coli in the TJs of epithelial cells. Here we show that striatin affects  integrity and cell migration, probably through a mechanism that involves the adhesion molecule E-cadherin. Cells engaged in cell-cell adhesion expressed a high MW-modified form of striatin that forms stable associations with detergent-insoluble, membrane-bound cellular fractions. In addition, striatin has recently been suggested to be a target of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases Tankyrase 1, and we have found that striatin interacts with Tankyrase 1 and is subsequently poly-ADP-ribosylated. Taken together, our results suggest that striatin is a novel cell-cell junctional protein that functions to maintain correct cell adhesion and may have a role in establishing the relationship between AJs and TJs that is fundamental for epithelial cell-cell adhesion.-Lahav-Ariel, L., Caspi, M., Nadar-Ponniah, P.

Elderly patients have a less favorable prognosis compared with young adult patients. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we tested our hypothesis that an increased inflammatory response to acute ischemic injury in old stroke mice leads to more severe brain damage and behavioral dysfunction. An ischemic stroke model was created in 2- and 12-month-old C57BL/6 mice through permanent occlusion of the left distal middle cerebral artery (dMCAO). Infarct/atrophy volumes were quantified by staining the brain sections with Cresyl Violet. Sensorimotor function was assessed using the corner test and adhesive removal test. Quantification of CD68 cells in the peri-infarct region was performed at 1, 3 and 14 days after dMCAO. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in the ischemic brain tissue were measured using ELISA. Western blot was used to determine the expression levels of  proteins, claudin-5 and zonula occludens (ZO)-1. Blood-brain barrier permeability was measured by Evans blue (EB) extravasation. Gelatinase  (MMP-9, type IV collagenase) was measured by gel zymography. Compared to 2-month-old mice, 12-month-old mice had more severe behavioral deficits at both the acute and chronic stages of stroke. Compared with the 2-month-old mice, 12-month-old mice had larger infarct/atrophy volumes at 1 and 14 days after dMCAO, higher levels of IL-6 and IL-1β, higher MMP9 activity, and lower levels of claudin-5 and ZO-1 at 1 and 3 days after dMCAO. 12-month-old mice also had more CD68 cells in the peri-infarct region at 1, 3 and 14 days after dMCAO and more EB leakage at 3 days after dMCAO. A higher inflammatory response at the acute stage of ischemic stroke in old mice is associated with more severe neuronal injury and long-term behavioral dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939485>DL-3-n-butylphthalide protects the blood-brain barrier against ischemia/hypoxia injury via upregulation of  proteins.</a></h2><p>The increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) induced by ischemia/hypoxia is generally correlated with alteration of  (TJs). DL-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects after ischemic injury. However, few studies have assessed the correlation between NBP and TJs. This study aimed to investigate the potential effect of NBP on the TJ proteins claudin-5, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and occludin during brain ischemia.A chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) Sprague-Dawley rat model was established, and NBP (20, 40, or 80 mg/kg, gavage, once a day) treatment was performed for 14 days. NBP (0.1 or 1.0 μmol/L) pre-treatment was applied to an in vitro hypoxia microvascular endothelial cell model (1% O2, 24 h). BBB permeability was assessed by performing the Evans blue assay. The expressions and localization of claudin-5, ZO-1, occludin, phosphorylated/total protein kinase  (p-Akt/Akt), phosphorylated/total glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β)/GSK-3β, and β-catenin/β-actin were evaluated by Western blotting or immunofluorescence. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was measured by flow cytometry analysis. TJ ultrastructure was observed by transmission electron microscopy.In CCH rats, treatment with 40 and 80 mg/kg NBP decreased the Evans blue content in brain tissue (9.0 ± 0.9 μg/g vs. 12.3 ± 1.9 μg/g, P = 0.005; 6.7 ± 0.6 μg/g vs. 12.3 ± 1.9 μg/g, P < 0.01), increased the expression of claudin-5 (0.79 ± 0.08 vs. 0.41 ± 0.06, P < 0.01; 0.97 ± 0.07 vs. 0.41 ± 0.06, P < 0.01), and elevated the ZO-1 protein level (P < 0.05) in brain microvascular segments in a dose-dependent manner in comparison with the corresponding values in the model group. There was no significant difference in occludin expression (P > 0.05). In the hypoxia cell model, NBP pre-treatment improved TJ ultrastructure, decreased intracellular ROS level, and increased the expression of claudin-5 (P < 0.01) and ZO-1 (P < 0.01) in comparison with the corresponding values in the hypoxia group. NBP treatment also elevated the relative expression levels of p-Akt/Akt, p-GSK-3β/GSK-3β, and β-catenin/β-actin in comparison with the corresponding values in the hypoxia group (all P < 0.05).NBP improves the barrier function of BBB against ischemic injury by upregulating the expression of TJ proteins, possibly by reducing oxidative stress and activating the Akt/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579831>KY-226 Protects Blood-brain Barrier Function Through the Akt/FoxO1 Signaling Pathway in Brain Ischemia.</a></h2><p>KY-226 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibitor that protects neurons from cerebral ischemic injury. KY-226 restores Akt (protein kinase ) phosphorylation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) reduction in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) damage. However, the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of KY-226 are unclear. To address this, the effects of KY-226 on blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction were examined in tMCAO mice. KY-226 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to ICR mice 30 min after 2 h of tMCAO. To assess Akt or ERK involvement, wortmannin (i.c.v.) or U0126 (i.v.), selective inhibitors of PI3K and ERK, respectively, were administered to mice 30 min before ischemia. BBB integrity was assessed by Evans blue leakage 24 h post-reperfusion. The levels of  (TJ) proteins, ZO-1 and occludin, were measured by western blotting; ZO-1 mRNA level was measured by RT-PCR. Compared to vehicle, KY-226 treatment prevented BBB breakdown and reduction in TJ protein levels. KY-226 treatment restored ZO-1 mRNA levels post-reperfusion. Pre-administration of wortmannin or U0126 blocked the protective effects of KY-226 on ZO-1 protein and mRNA reduction in tMCAO mice. In bEnd.3 cells, lipopolysaccharide treatment reduced mRNA and protein levels of ZO-1, an effect rescued by KY-226 treatment. Further, KY-226 treatment restored phosphorylation of pAkt (T308) and its downstream target forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) (S256) in bEnd.3 cells. Collectively, we demonstrate that KY-226 protects BBB integrity by restoration of TJ proteins, an effect partly mediated by Akt/FoxO1 pathway activation. Thus, protection of BBB integrity likely underlies KY-226-induced neuroprotection in tMCAO mice.Copyright © 2018 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The absorption and   of the gut play a vital role in the maintenance of body homeostasis. This study was to investigate the protective effects of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SC06 (Ba) on HO-induced oxidative stress on intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-1) based on the level of gene expression. We demonstrated that Ba was a safe probiotic strain in the first place. Results showed that treatment with HO significantly increased the mRNA expression of absorptive transporters glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), Ala/Ser/Cys/Thr transporter 1 (ASCT1), and ASCT2 compared with the control group. Meanwhile, oxidative stress induced a significant improvement in the mRNA expression of occludin (OCLN) and caspase-3, and remarkably inhibited the expression of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) or  cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), respectively. Pretreatment with Ba dramatically reversed the disturbance induced by oxidative stress on the mRNA expression of ASCT1, ASCT2, and OCLN, which also significantly prevented HO-inhibited LAT1 and Bcl-2 mRNA expression. However, Ba failed to exert any significant protective effect on GLUT2 and caspase-3 mRNA expression. We concluded that pretreatment with Ba could alleviate the damage caused by oxidative stress to a certain extent and conferred a protective effect to the intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666361>Novel strains of Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides ovatus alleviate the LPS-induced inflammation in mice.</a></h2><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can promote the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, damage the  of epithelial walls, and thereby lead to chronic low-grade intestinal inflammatory disorders.

One of the most susceptible animal species known and thus a good model for characterizing toxicological pathways, is the domesticated turkey (DT), a condition likely due, at least in part, to deficient hepatic AFB₁-detoxifying alpha-class glutathione S-transferases (GSTAs). Conversely, wild turkeys (Eastern wild, EW) are relatively resistant to the hepatotoxic, hepatocarcinogenic and immunosuppressive effects of AFB₁ owing to functional gene expression and presence of functional hepatic GSTAs. This study was designed to compare the responses in gene expression in the gastrointestinal tract between DT (susceptible phenotype) and EW (resistant phenotype) following dietary AFB₁ challenge (320 ppb for 14 days); specifically in cecal tonsil which functions in both nutrient absorption and gut immunity. RNAseq and gene expression analysis revealed significant differential gene expression in AFB₁-treated animals compared to control-fed domestic and wild birds and in within-treatment comparisons between bird types. Significantly upregulated expression of the primary hepatic AFB₁-activating P450 () as well as transcriptional changes in  proteins were observed in AFB₁-treated birds. Numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines,  and  were significantly down regulated by AFB₁ treatment in DT birds and pathway analysis suggested suppression of enteroendocrine cells. Conversely, AFB₁ treatment modified significantly fewer unique genes in EW birds; among these were genes involved in lipid synthesis and metabolism and immune response. This is the first investigation of the effects of AFB₁ on the turkey gastro-intestinal tract. Results suggest that in addition to the hepatic transcriptome, animal resistance to this mycotoxin occurs in organ systems outside the liver, specifically as a refractory gastrointestinal tract.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30447529>The novel N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist MN-08 ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in mice.</a></h2><p>Acute lung injury (ALI) is a clinically severe respiratory disorder, and effective therapy is urgently needed. MN-08, a novel synthetic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, was investigated for its effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. In vitro, the protective effect of MN-08 on inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and  (TJs) structure was explored in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells and A549 cells. MN-08 markedly decreased (p < 0.001) the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and reactive oxygen species (ROS), whereas it moderately upregulated (p < 0.05) heme oxygenase (HO)-1 protein expression in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Moreover, MN-08 significantly inhibited (p < 0.001) cell apoptosis and improved (p < 0.001) protein expression of TJs in LPS-induced A549 cells. In vivo, the therapeutic effect of MN-08 was evaluated in the LPS-induced ALI model through intratracheal instillation in BALB/c mice. MN-08 administration dramatically attenuated (p < 0.001) pulmonary pathological changes and reduced (p < 0.001) the levels of glutamate, myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), and number of cells in BALF, whereas it increased (p < 0.05) superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) activities in ALI mice. Furthermore, MN-08 markedly blocked the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)/nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κ (NF-κ) signaling pathways in RAW 264.7 cells and lung tissues. These results indicate that MN-08 exhibits lung protection in an LPS-induced ALI model via anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

Since serine alleviates oxidative stress and inflammatory response which are accompany with early weaning, we conducted the study to explore whether serine improves intestinal function in early-weaned piglets.Twenty-eight weaned piglets (aged 21 d) were fed either a basal diet or a basal diet plus 0.2% serine. We determined the effects of dietary serine supplementation on intestinal morphology by hematoxylin and eosin staining, expression of  proteins (TJPs) by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence, expression of inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis markers by RT-qPCR and the level of antioxidant enzymes with ELISA kits in early-weaned piglets.Serine supplementation increased daily body weight gain while decreasing diarrhea incidence. Both the jejunum and ileum of serine-supplemented piglets showed regularly arranged villi and microvilli. Moreover, dietary serine increased TJP expression, and alleviated apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in the intestine of early-weaned piglets.Our findings suggest that serine has the potential for use as a feed additive to prevent gut dysfunction caused by weaning.© 2018 The Author(s).

This regulation promoted the exploration of natural plant bioactive compounds (PBCs) as feed additives to improve productivity, welfare and health of livestock and poultry. Along with several beneficial attributes of PBCs, including antimicrobial, antioxidant and various pharmacological effects, they also improve barrier function and nutrient transport in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This comprehensive review discusses the effects of different PBCs on the integrity, nutrient transport and permeability of GI epithelia and their mechanism of actions. Dietary PBCs influence the maintenance and enhancement of GI integrity via a number of mechanisms including altered signaling pathways and expression of several  proteins (claudins, occludin, and zonula occludens proteins), altered expression of various cytokines, chemokines, complement components and their transcription factors, goblet cell abundance and mucin gene expression, and the modulation of the cellular immune system. They also affect nutrient transporter gene expression and active absorption of nutrients, minerals and ammonia. One intriguing perspective is to select an effective dose at which a specific PBC could improve GI barrier function and nutrient absorption. The effective doses and clear-cut molecular mechanisms for PBCs are yet to be elucidated to understand discrepant observations among different studies and to improve the targeted biotechnological and pharmaceutical uses of PBCs in farm animals. The latter will also enable a more successful use of such PBCs in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30125827>Role of AMPK in the expression of  proteins in heat-treated porcine Sertoli cells.</a></h2><p>Hyperthermia can cause dysfunction of the  (TJs) in testes. Adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) participates in the regulation of TJs in testis. However, whether AMPK regulates the expression of TJ proteins in the response of Sertoli cells to heat treatment remains unknown. We subjected Sertoli cells from 3-week-old piglets to heat treatment (43 °C, 30 min), which decreased cell viability, and increased the early apoptosis rate. These effects were reversible and the cells gradually recovered to normal viability at 48 h post-heat treatment. Expression of TJ proteins (claudin 11, JAMA, occludin, and ZO1) was detected in immature porcine Sertoli cells. The mRNA and protein levels of TJ proteins significantly decreased at 1 h after heat exposure, but recovered with increasing recovery time. Additionally, the expression of claudin 11 in the cytoplasm was also markedly decreased by heat treatment. AMPK phosphorylation, the cellular ATP level, and Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase  (CaMKKB) level, but not the liver kinase B1 (LKB1) level, were downregulated by heat treatment. More importantly, activation or overexpression of AMPK, which is a regulator of the assembly of TJs, partially rescued the heat treatment-induced downregulation of TJ proteins. By contrast, AMPK knockdown using small interfering RNA (siRNA) further decreased the expression levels of TJ proteins. In addition, claudin 11 was almost undetectable post heat treatment. Collectively, this study demonstrated that heat treatment could reversibly perturb the expression of TJ proteins in immature porcine Sertoli cells by inhibiting the AMPK signaling pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

RPE cells release neurotrophic growth factors such as pigment epithelial derived factor (PEDF), which is reduced in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The mechanisms that control the secretion of PEDF from RPE cells are not well understood. Using the CCL2/CX3CR1 double knockout mouse model (DKO), which demonstrates RPE damage and retinal degeneration, we uncovered an interaction between PEDF and the TEP which is likely to play an important role in retinal ageing and in the pathogenesis of AMD. We found that: (a) the expression of ATP1B1 (the Na /K -ATPase β1 subunit) was reduced significantly in RPE from aged mice, in patients with CNV (Choroidal Neovascularization) and in DKO mice; () the expression of PEDF also was decreased in aged persons and in DKO mice; (c) the TEP across RPE was reduced markedly in RPE cells from DKO mice and (d) an applied electric field (EF) of 50-100 mV/mm, used to mimic the natural TEP, increased the expression and secretion of PEDF in primary RPE cells. In conclusion, the TEP across the RPE depends on the expression of ATP1B1 and this regulates the secretion of PEDF by RPE cells and so may regulate the onset of retinal disease. Increasing the expression of PEDF using an applied EF to replenish a disease or age-reduced TEP may offer a new way of preventing or reversing retinal dysfunction.© 2018 The Authors.

Angiopoietins (ANGPTs) are vascular growth factors that play an important role in vascular stabilization. We hypothesized that neutrophil elastase is one of the key determinants of vascular endothelium disruption/destabilization and affects angiopoietins expression after spinal cord injury. To test this, tubule formation and angiopoietins expression were assessed in endothelial cells exposed to different concentrations of recombinant neutropil elastase. Then, the expression of angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, and neutrophil elastase was determined at 3 h and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days in a clinically relevant model of moderate compression (35 g for 5 min at T10) spinal cord injury. A dichotomy between the levels of angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 was observed; thus, we utilized a specific neutrophil elastase inhibitor (sivelestat sodium; 30 mg/kg, i.p., .i.d.) after spinal cord injury. The expression levels of neutropil elastase and angiopoietin-2 increased, and that of angiopoietin-1 decreased after spinal cord injury in rats. The sivelestat regimen, optimized via a pharmacokinetics study, had potent effects on vascular stabilization by upregulating angiopoietin-1 via the AKT pathway and preventing  protein degradation. Moreover, sivelestat attenuated the levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines after spinal cord injury and hence subsequently alleviated secondary damage observed as a reduction in glial scar formation and the promotion of blood vessel formation and stabilization. As a result, hindlimb locomotor function significantly recovered in the sivelestat-treated animals as determined by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale and footprint analyses. Furthermore, sivelestat treatment attenuated neuropathic pain as assessed by responses to von Frey filaments after spinal cord injury. Thus, our result suggests that inhibiting neutropil elastase by administration of sivelestat is a promising therapeutic strategy to inhibit glial scar and promote functional recovery by upregulating angiopoietin-1 after spinal cord injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30430944>Recognizing the Leaky Gut as a Trans-diagnostic Target for Neuroimmune Disorders Using Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Immunology Assays.</a></h2><p>Increased intestinal permeability with heightened translocation of Gramnegative bacteria, also known as "leaky gut", is associated with the pathophysiology of neuroimmune disorders, such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CSF) and (deficit) schizophrenia, as well as with general medical disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome. This review aims to summarize clinical biochemistry and molecular immunology tests that may aid in the recognition of leaky gut in clinical practice.We searched online libraries, including PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar and Scopus, with the key words "diagnosis" or "biomarkers" and "leaky gut", "bacterial translocation", and "intestinal permeability" and focused on papers describing tests that may aid in the clinical recognition of leaky gut.To evaluate  barrier integrity, serum IgG/IgA/IgM responses to occludin and zonulin and IgA responses to actomyosin should be evaluated. The presence of cytotoxic bacterial products in serum can be evaluated using IgA/IgM responses to sonicated samples of common Gram-negative gut commensal bacteria and assays of serum lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and other bacterial toxins, including cytolethal distenting toxin, subunit . Major factors associated with increased gut permeability, including gut dysbiosis and yeast overgrowth, use of NSAIDs and alcohol, food hypersensitivities (IgE-mediated), food intolerances (IgG-mediated), small bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), systemic inflammation, psychosocial stressors, some infections (e.g., HIV) and dietary patterns, should be assessed. Stool samples can be used to assay gut dysbiosis, gut inflammation and decreased mucosal defenses using assays of fecal growth of bacteria, yeast and fungi and stool assays of calprotectin, secretory IgA, β-defensin, α- antitrypsin, lysozyme and lactoferrin. Blood and breath tests should be used to exclude common causes of increased gut permeability, namely, food hypersensitivities and intolerances, SIBO, lactose intolerance and fructose malabsorption.Here, we propose strategies to recognize "leaky gut" in a clinical setting using the most adequate clinical chemistry and molecular immunology assays.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30716522>Vitamin A deficiency impairs intestinal physical barrier function of fish.</a></h2><p>The present study was the first to investigate the effects of dietary vitamin A (VA) on the intestinal physical barrier function associated with oxidation, antioxidant system, apoptosis and cell-cellular  (TJ) in the proximal (PI), mid (MI) and distal (DI) intestines of young grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). Fish were fed graded levels of dietary VA for 10 weeks, and then a challenge test using an injection of Aeromonas hydrophila was conducted for 14 days. Results indicated that dietary VA deficiency caused oxidative damage to fish intestine partly by the reduced non-enzymatic antioxidant components glutathione (GSH) and VA contents as well as reduced antioxidant enzyme activities [not including manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD)]. Further results observed that the decreased antioxidant enzyme activities by VA deficiency were partly related to the down-regulation of their corresponding mRNA levels which were regulated by the down-regulation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) mRNA levels and up-regulation of kelch-like-ECH-associated protein (Keap1a) (rather than Keap1b) mRNA levels in three intestinal segments of fish. Meanwhile, VA deficiency up-regulated the mRNA levels of the apoptosis signalling [caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9 (rather than caspase-7)] associated with the inhibition of the target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling pathway in three intestinal segments of fish. Additionally, VA deficiency decreased the mRNA levels of TJ complexes [claudin-, claudin-c, claudin-3, claudin-12, claudin-15a, occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in the PI, MI and DI, as well as claudin-7 and claudin-11a in the MI and DI] linked to the up-regulation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) signalling. These results suggested that VA deficiency impaired structural integrity in three intestinal segments of fish. Meanwhile, excessive VA also showed similar negative effects on these indexes. Taken together, the current study firstly demonstrated that VA deficiency impaired physical barrier functions associated with impaired antioxidant capacity, aggravated cell apoptosis and disrupted TJ complexes in the PI, MI and DI, but different segments performed different actions in fish. Based on protecting fish against protein oxidation, the optimal VA levels for grass carp were estimated to be 2622 IU/kg diet.Copyright © 2019.

The worldwide shortage of donor corneal tissue has led to increasing pressure to seek an alternative for surgical restoration of corneal endothelium. Compressed collagen (CC) gels have excellent biocompatibility, simple preparation course and easy to be manipulated. This study aimed to form a new biomimetic endothelium graft by CC.We expanded bovine corneal endothelial cells (-CECs) on laminin-coated CC to form a biomimetic endothelium graft. Scanning electron microscope was used for ultrastructural analysis and  protein ZO-1 expression was tested by immunohistochemistry.The biomimetic endothelium graft, we conducted had normal cell morphology, ultrastructure and higher cell density (3612.2 ± 43.4 cells/mm). ZO-1 localization at -CECs membrane indicated the bioengineered graft possess the basic endothelium function.A.biomimetic endothelium graft with -CECs expanded on CC sheet was constructed, which possessed cells' morphology similar to that of in vivo endothelial cells and specific basic function of endothelium layer. This method provided the possibility of using one donor's cornea to form multiple uniformed endothelium grafts so as to overcome the shortage of cadaveric cornea tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714321>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass decreases endotoxemia and inflammatory stress in association with improvements in gut permeability in obese diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Postoperative modulation of the gut microbiome has been suggested to contribute to the metabolic benefits after metabolic surgery, but the mechanisms underlying these metabolic benefits remain unknown. Previously, we reported that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats increased the abundance of Proteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. However, theoretically, these Gram-negative bacteria may elevate lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels. Therefore, in this study we further investigated the potential mechanisms by which RYGB improves glucose homeostasis, endotoxemia, and inflammatory stress in ZDF rats.Rats were divided into three groups: (a) an RYGB group (RY); () a sham-operated group pair-fed with the RY group; and (c) a sham-operated group fed ad libitum. Changes in LPS, cytokine levels, intestinal permeability (evaluated using the fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran method), and intestinal epithelial  proteins zona occludins (ZO)-1, occludin, and claudin-1 were assessed 10 weeks postoperatively.Rats that underwent RYGB exhibited sustained weight loss and reduced glucose, as well as lower cytokine and LPS concentrations, than rats in the control groups. In the colonic epithelium, ZO1 and claudin-1 (Cldn1) mRNA levels were higher in the RY than control groups. Intestinal permeability declined in the RY group and was positively correlated with LPS levels and negatively correlated with ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1 expression.The results demonstrate that RYGB can reduce the extent of endotoxemia and inflammation, which is associated with improved  integrity and intestinal barrier strength. These effects may explain why a low level of inflammation is maintained after RYGB and the postoperative increase in Gram-negative bacteria.© 2019 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31364678>Biomaterial- interaction and potential impacts.</a></h2><p>The active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) have to cross the natural barriers and get into the blood to impart the pharmacological effects. The  (TJs) between the epithelial cells serve as the major selectively permeable barriers and control the paracellular transport of the majority of hydrophilic drugs, in particular, peptides and proteins. TJs perfectly balance the targeted transport and the exclusion of other unexpected pathogens under the normal conditions. Many biomaterials have shown the capability to open the TJs and improve the oral bioavailability and targeting efficacy of the APIs. Nevertheless, there is limited understanding of the biomaterial-TJ interactions. The opening of the TJs further poses the risk of autoimmune diseases and infections.

Various amino acids have been shown to improve the intestinal tract, but the effect of tryptophan on the intestinal barrier has been controversial. Here, an in vitro Caco-2 cell model was built to investigate the protective and reparative effects of different concentrations of dietary l-Tryptophan (l-Trp) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intestinal  injury. Lower concentrations (40 μM) of dietary l-Trp protected and repaired the integrity and permeability injury of the intestinal  induced by LPS, while high concentrations (80 μM) may not have a positive effect. LPS-induced injury led to increased (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of Nuclear factor-kappa  (NFκ) and Myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), and decreased (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Mitogen-activated protein (MAP), and the treatment of dietary l-Trp alleviated those regulations in different concentrations, which suggests that dietary l-Trp may attenuate LPS-induced injury to  via inhibiting the NFκ-MLCK signaling pathway and activating the ERK1/2-MAP signaling pathway. And the mRNA and protein expressions of claudin-1, occludin and ZO-1 in LPS-induced injury were all down-regulated to varying degrees, and dietary l-Trp weakened the down-regulation of claudin-1 (P < 0.05) with no significant regulation of the protein expression of occludin and ZO-1 (P > 0.05).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639310>Increase in P-glycoprotein levels in the blood-brain barrier of partial portal vein ligation /chronic hyperammonemia rats is medicated by ammonia/reactive oxygen species/ERK1/2 activation: In vitro and in vivo studies.</a></h2><p>Liver failure altered P-glycoprotein (P-gp) function and expression at blood-brain barrier (BBB), partly owing to hyperammonemia. We aimed to examine the effects of partial portal vein ligation (PVL) plus chronic hyperammonemia (CHA) on P-gp function and expression at rat BBB. Experimental rats included sham-operation (SH), PVL, CHA and PVL+CHA. The PVL+CHA rats were developed by ammonia-containing diet for 2 weeks after operation. The brain-to-plasma concentration ratios (K) and apparent unidirectional influx constants (K) of rhodamine123 and sodium fluorescein were measured to assess function of P-gp and BBB integrity, respectively. Human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (HCMEC/D3) were used to assess effects of ammonia on P-gp expression and function. It was found that PVL+CHA significantly decreased K and K of rhodamine123 without affecting brain distribution of fluorescein. The P-gp expressions in membrane protein in cortex and hippocampus were significantly increased in CHA and PVL +CHA rats, especially in PVL + CHA rats, while remarkably increased phosphorylated ERK1/2 was only found in PVL +CHA rats. Expressions of  proteins claudin-5 and occluding in rat brain remained unchanged. In vitro data showed that NHCl increased reactive oxygen species, membrane expression and function of P-gp as well as phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels in HCMEC/D3. The NHCl-induced alterations were reversed by reactive oxygen species scavenger N-acetylcysteine and ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126. In conclusion, PVL+CHA increased function and membrane translocation of P-gp at rat BBB partly via ammonia. Reactive oxygen species/ERK1/2 pathway activation may be one of the reasons that ammonia upregulated P-gp expression and function at BBB.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Some probiotics were demonstrated to exert beneficial effects in the gastrointestinal tract. The present study was aimed to evaluate the protective effects of Lactobacillus plantarum CMU995 against alcohol-induced liver injury. The mice were orally administered L. plantarum CMU995 for 1 week, followed by the administration of alcohol and different tested substances daily for 6 weeks. The liver injury was examined by measuring the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), malondialdehyde (MDA), anti-oxidative enzyme, endotoxin, inflammatory cytokines, and lipid accumulation in the liver or serum among different groups. L. plantarum CMU995 exhibited beneficial effects on alcohol-induced liver injury via reduction in the serum concentration of AST, ALT, cholesterol, triglycerides, endotoxin, TNF-α, IL-1β, and oxidative stress. Furthermore, we also found that the levels of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and intestinal  protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) were considerably higher in L. plantarum CMU995-fed groups when compared with placebo group. Meanwhile, the protective effects were demonstrated biological gradients as controversial dose-dependent. We speculate that L. plantarum CMU995 inhibited the migration of alcohol-derived endotoxin into the blood and liver, thereby improving the intestinal barrier. The present evidence may provide a novel microbiota-based strategy to prevent the alcohol-induced liver injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30031105>EphBs and ephrin-Bs: Trans-synaptic organizers of synapse development and function.</a></h2><p>Synapses are specialized cell-cell  that underlie the function of neural circuits by mediating communication between neurons.

A total of 720 1-d-old broilers were assigned into 4 treatments with 6 replicates per treatment (30 birds per replicate): (1) basal diet (Ctr), (2) basal diet with 200 mg/kg enramycin (ER), (3) basal diet with 75 U/kg GOD, and (4) GOD diet (75U/kg) supplemented with 1 × 105 colony-forming units BaSC06/kg feed (GB), for an experimental duration of 52 d. The results showed that there were no significant effects of GOD or GB on growth performance of birds. The shear force and drip loss of breast muscle of birds fed GOD and GB were less than those fed ER, while the shear force in GB significantly decreased compared to Ctr. Also, both GOD and GB treatment increased about 1-fold expression of ZO-1, Claudin-1, Occludin, and MUC-2 genes in jejunal mucosa compared to Ctr, no difference was found between GOD and GB. Compared to Ctr, serum total antioxidant capability and glutathione peroxidase in GOD and GB increased, while the malondialdehyde level and xanthine oxidase activity significantly decreased. Both GOD and GB treatments reduced the relative level of HO-1, p53, and BAX transcripts in liver. It is worth noting that GB decreased transcription of p53 and Bcl-2 by 76.11% and 50.19% compared to GOD, respectively. In addition, compared to Ctr, GOD and GB markedly increased serum IL-2 content by 110% and 182%, while decreased IFN-γ by 43.57% and 57.51%, respectively. The highest sIgA level in GB was found among four groups. In conclusion, dietary treatment with GOD and its combination with BaSC06 both had beneficial effects on shear force and drip loss, expression of intestinal , antioxidative capacity and immune function. It is suggested that GB had better effect than GOD on anti-apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30743078>Protective effects of berberine hydrochloride on DSS-induced ulcerative colitis in rats.</a></h2><p>Berberine hydrochloride is one the effective compound among Rhizoma Coptidis, Cortex Phellodendri, and other plants. There are several clinical functions of berberine hydrochloride including anti-inflammation, antitumor and immunoregulatory. However, the anti-inflammatory of berberine hydrochloride in ulcerative colitis is barely understood. In this study, we aimed to explore the effects of berberine hydrochloride on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced rats model of ulcerative colitis.The severity of colitis were measured by body weight, survial rate, colon length and disease activity index (DAI) score. The cytokines expression include IL-1, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-α, TGF-β and IFN-γ were performed by RT-PCR and ELISA. Signaling pathway proteins such as p-STAT3, STAT3, p-NF-κ p65 and NF-κ p65 were analyzed by western blot and immunofluorescence. The proteins expression of  were explored using western blotting and immunohistochemistry.Rats were administered berberine hydrochloride showed less weight loss and longer colon length than the DSS-induced group. The expression of IL-1, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α, TGF-β and IFN-γ were suppressed, yet the expression of IL-4 and IL-10 were up-regulated by berberine hydrochloride and sulphasalazine treatment compared to the model group. Meanwhile, treatment with berberine hydrochloride effectively increased the expression of SIgA and decreased the expression of iNOS, MPO, MDA. In terms of the biochemical analyses, the results showed that the expression of p-STAT3 was signifcantly increased, while the expression of p-NF-κ (p65) was suppressed compared to the model group via western blot and immunofluorescence analysis.Berberine hydrochloride has beneficial effects in UC. The possible mechanism of anti-inflammatory response by berberine hydrochloride may involve in the blocking of the IL-6/STAT3/NF-κ signaling pathway. Collectively, these fndings provide evidence that berberine hydrochloride might be a useful herb medicine and serve as a promising novel therapy in the treatment of UC in humans.Copyright © 2018.

During pregnancy, the Zika virus (ZIKV) poses a serious prenatal threat. STB cells are resistant to ZIKV infections, yet placental cells within the mesenchyme of chorionic villi are targets of ZIKV infection. We seek to determine whether ZIKV can open the paracellular pathway of STB cells. This route is regulated by  (TJs) which are present in the uppermost portion of the lateral membranes of STB cells. We analyzed the paracellular permeability and expression of E-cadherin, occludin, JAMs - and -C, claudins -1, -3, -4, -5 and -7, and ZO-1, and ZO-2 in the STB of placentae from ZIKV-infected and non-infected women. In ZIKV-infected placentae, the pattern of expression of TJ proteins was preserved, but the amount of claudin-4 diminished. Placentae from ZIKV-infected women were permeable to ruthenium red, and had chorionic villi with a higher mean diameter and Hofbauer hyperplasia. Finally, ZIKV added to the basolateral surface of a trophoblast cell line reduced the transepithelial electrical resistance. These results suggest that ZIKV can open the paracellular pathway of STB cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30353739>Bioactive factors secreted by Bifidobacterium breve -3 enhance barrier function in human intestinal Caco-2 cells.</a></h2><p>Intestinal barrier function is closely related to intestinal health and diseases. Recent studies demonstrate that some probiotic and commensal bacteria secrete metabolites that are capable of affecting the intestinal functions. The present study examined an enhancing effect of bioactive factors secreted by Bifidobacterium breve strain -3 on the intestinal  (TJ) barrier integrity in human intestinal Caco-2 cells. Administration of conditioned medium obtained from . breve strain -3 (B3CM) to Caco-2 cells for 24 h increased trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TER), a TJ barrier indicator, across their monolayers. Immunoblot, immunofluorescence, and qPCR analyses demonstrated that B3CM increased an integral TJ protein, claudin-4 expression. In luciferase reporter assay, the administration of B3CM enhanced the claudin-4 promoter activity, indicating the transcriptional upregulation of claudin-4. Site-directed mutation of specificity protein 1 (Sp1) binding sites in the claudin-4 promoter sequence and suppression of Sp1 expression by siRNA technology clearly reduced the enhancing effect of B3CM on claudin-4 promoter activity. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry detected a significant amount of acetic acid in B3CM (28.3 mM). The administration of acetic acid to Caco-2 cells partially mimicked a B3CM-mediated increase in TER, but failed to increase claudin-4 expression. Taken together, bioactive factors secreted by . breve -3 enhanced the TJ barrier integrity in intestinal Caco-2 cells. Transcriptional regulation of claudin-4 through Sp1 is at least in part one of the underlying molecular mechanisms. In addition, acetic acid contributes to the B3CM-mediated barrier effect independently of claudin-4 expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907592>Citrus Flavanones Enhance β-Carotene Uptake in Vitro Experiment Using Caco-2 Cell: Structure-Activity Relationship and Molecular Mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Flavonoids can interfere with the absorption of carotenoids. In this study, the inherent mechanisms of 12 citrus flavanones for β-carotene (Bc) cellular uptake and the structure-activity relationship were investigated. The results showed that multiple hydroxyl groups had the lowest promoting effect. O-Glycosylation at C7 of the A ring led to the greatest promoting effect on Bc absorption. O-Glycosylation at C7 exhibited a strong affinity with the cell membrane and subsequently fluidized the cell membrane. Aglycon molecules significantly induced transient increases of paracellular permeability by decreasing tight junction proteins (ZO-1, claudin-1) expression. In addition, citrus flavanones might enhance scavenger receptor class  type I (SR-BI) expression via their actions as agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). Catechol structure in the -ring attenuated the activate action of SR-BI expression. The structure-dependent membrane permeability and activation of specific membrane proteins are mechanistically associated with the promoting effect on Bc cellular uptake by citrus flavanones.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30170602>Effect of tryptase on mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells via protease-activated receptor 2.</a></h2><p>Mast cells (MCs), the 'first responders' in brain injury, are able to disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB), but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Tryptase is the most abundant MC secretory product. Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) has been identified as a specific receptor for tryptase, which is abundantly expressed in brain microvascular endothelial cells. The BBB comprises brain microvascular endothelial cells that display specialised molecular properties essential for BBB function and integrity. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of tryptase on mouse brain microvascular endothelial cell line bEnd3 and its potential mechanisms of action.Induction of mouse brain microvascular endothelial cell activation by tryptase was examined. Then, mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells were pretreated with a PAR-2 antagonist and stimulated with tryptase. Cellular activation, proinflammatory cytokine production, expression of PAR-2, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), nuclear factor kappa  (NF-kappa ) phosphorylation were assessed.Tryptase upregulated the production of VCAM-1, MMPs (MMP9 and MMP2), TLR4 and TNF-α and downregulated the expression of the  proteins occludin and claudin-5 in mouse brain microvascular endothelial cell. Among the MAPK and NF-kappa  pathway, ERK and NF-kappa  were activated by tryptase. All of these effects could be eliminated by the PAR-2 inhibitor.Based on our findings, we conclude that tryptase can trigger brain microvascular endothelial cell activation and proinflammatory mediator release.

Escherichia coli is a bacterial pathogen that can disrupt the CNS function, especially in neonates. E. coli meningitis occurs after bacteria invade the brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) that form a direct and essential barrier restricting the entry of circulating microbes and toxins to the brain. Previous studies have reported on several cellular proteins that function during meningitic E. coli infections; however, more comprehensive investigations to elucidate the potential targets involved in E. coli meningitis are essential to better understand this disease and discover new treatments for it.The isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) approach coupled with LC-MS/MS were applied to compare and characterize the different proteomic profiles of BMECs in response to meningitic or non-meningitic E. coli strains. KEGG and gene ontology annotations, ingenuity pathways analysis, and functional experiments were combined to identify the key host molecules involved in the meningitic E. coli-induced  breakdown and neuroinflammatory responses.A total of 13 cellular proteins were found to be differentially expressed by meningitic E. coli strains PCN033 and RS218, including one that was also affected by HB101, a non-meningitic E. coli strain. Through bioinformatics analysis, we identified the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), granzyme A, NF-κ signaling, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways as being biologically involved in the meningitic E. coli-induced  breakdown and neuroinflammation. Functionally, we showed that MIF facilitated meningitic E. coli-induced production of cytokines and chemokines and also helped to disrupt the blood-brain barrier by decreasing the expression of  proteins like ZO-1, occludin. Moreover, we demonstrated the significant activation of NF-κ and MAPK signaling in BMECs in response to meningitic E. coli strains, which dominantly determined the generation of the proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β.Our work identified 12 host cellular targets that are affected by meningitic E. coli strains and revealed MIF to be an important contributor to meningitic E. coli-induced cytokine production and  disruption, and also the NF-κ and MAPK signaling pathways that are mainly involved in the infection-induced cytokines production.

However, their application in nasal spray generation with favorable characteristics has not been investigated.Thermosensitive chitosan (CS)-based formulations with different viscosities were prepared for intranasal delivery of ibuprofen using CS of various molecular weights. The formulation developed was optimized with regards to its physicochemical, rheological, biological properties and the generated aerosol characteristics.The formulations showed rapid gelation (4-7 min) at 30-35°C, which lies in the human nasal cavity temperature spectrum. The decrease in CS molecular weight to 110-150 kDa led to generation of optimum spray with lower Dv, wider spray area, and higher surface area coverage. This formulation also showed improved ibuprofen solubility that is approximately 100× higher than its intrinsic aqueous solubility, accelerated ibuprofen transport across human nasal epithelial cells and transient modulation of tight junctions.A thermosensitive CS-based formulation has been successfully developed with suitable rheological properties, aerosol performance and biological properties that is beneficial for nose-to-brain drug delivery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30604787>The protective role of phloretin against dextran sulfate sodium-induced ulcerative colitis in mice.</a></h2><p>Phloretin, a dihydrogen chalcone flavonoid, is mainly isolated from apples and strawberries. Phloretin has been proven to have many biological activities such as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative. Herein, we investigated the protective efficacy and potential mechanism of phloretin in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice. The results showed that phloretin resulted in a reduced DSS-induced disease activity index (DAI), colon length shortening and colonic pathological damage. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the colon were also decreased by the administration of phloretin. Exploration of the potential mechanism demonstrated that phloretin suppressed the inflammatory response by regulating the nuclear factor-κ (NF-κ), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) pathways. Phloretin also inhibited the DSS-induced (NOD)-like receptor family and pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activations. Further studies found that phloretin reduced key markers of oxidative stress as well as regulated the expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin. Interestingly, the concentration of serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was significantly decreased. Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Lactobacillus levels were also re-balanced after phloretin treatment.

Given that KA can alter blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, we investigated whether lactation would protect BBB permeability after treatment with this neurotoxin. Adult virgin or lactating (13-15 days pp) female Wistar rats were injected with an i.p. (10 mg/kg .w.) or i.c.v. (100 ng/1 μl) KA dose. Control groups received a similar volume of vehicle. BBB permeability was assessed by an injection of fluorescent FITC-conjugated dextran tracer (40 kDa, 50 mg/500 μl) or of 4% Evans blue dye (500 μl), given 24 h after KA administration. Extravasation of dye or tracer was detected in virgin but not in lactating rats exposed to KA. In particular, increased extravasation of FITC-dextran was detected in the hippocampal subfields CA1 and CA3 and in the cerebral cortex of virgin rats that received KA, while lactating rats showed increased label for FITC-dextran only in the cerebral cortex. Western blot analysis of  proteins showed a decrease of claudin-5 and occludin but not of zonula occludens-1 in the hippocampus of both virgin and lactating rats. These results allow us to conclude that the BBB of lactating rats is less sensitive to KA lesioning action in comparison to that of virgin rats by mechanisms different than those of  proteins.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, ginger and 6-shogaol suppressed the MPTP-induced enteric dopaminergic neuronal damage via increasing the cell survival signaling pathway.These results indicate that ginger and 6-shogaol restore the disruption of intestinal integrity and enteric dopaminergic neurons in an MPTP-injected mouse PD model by inhibiting the processes of inflammation and apoptosis, suggesting that they may attenuate the GI dysfunction in PD patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31242036>Intussusceptive Vascular Remodeling Precedes Pathological Neovascularization.</a></h2><p>Objective- Pathological neovascularization is crucial for progression and morbidity of serious diseases such as cancer, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration. While mechanisms of ongoing pathological neovascularization have been extensively studied, the initiating pathological vascular remodeling (PVR) events, which precede neovascularization remains poorly understood. Here, we identify novel molecular and cellular mechanisms of preneovascular PVR, by using the adult choriocapillaris as a model. Approach and Results- Using hypoxia or forced overexpression of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) in the subretinal space to induce PVR in zebrafish and rats respectively, and by analyzing choriocapillaris membranes adjacent to choroidal neovascular lesions from age-related macular degeneration patients, we show that the choriocapillaris undergo robust induction of vascular intussusception and permeability at preneovascular stages of PVR. This PVR response included endothelial cell proliferation, formation of endothelial luminal processes, extensive vesiculation and thickening of the endothelium, degradation of collagen fibers, and splitting of existing extravascular columns. RNA-sequencing established a role for endothelial  disruption, cytoskeletal remodeling, vesicle- and cilium biogenesis in this process. Mechanistically, using genetic gain- and loss-of-function zebrafish models and analysis of primary human choriocapillaris endothelial cells, we determined that HIF (hypoxia-induced factor)-1α-VEGF-A-VEGFR2 signaling was important for hypoxia-induced PVR. Conclusions- Our findings reveal that PVR involving intussusception and splitting of extravascular columns, endothelial proliferation, vesiculation, fenestration, and thickening is induced before neovascularization, suggesting that identifying and targeting these processes may prevent development of advanced neovascular disease in the future.

This study aimed to examine whether . subtilis CW14 protected against OTA-induced barrier disruption and cell damage to Caco-2 cells. The results showed that Caco-2 cells treated with OTA led to microvilli disruption,  protein (ZO-1 and claudin-1) damage, and inhibition of cell proliferation by arresting the cell cycle in the G2/M phase that promoted apoptosis. The treatment of . subtilis CW14 mitigated the  injury by improving ZO-1 protein expression, and it reduced apoptosis that was induced by OTA. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis indicated that OTA down-regulated genes that involved in the , cell cycle, and apoptosis-related signaling pathways. . subtilis CW14 may have protected the ZO-1 protein by activating the toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and it reduced OTA damage by down-regulating the death receptor genes and up-regulating the DNA repair genes. These findings demonstrated the importance of . subtilis CW14 in the regulation of  proteins and in reducing death of intestinal epithelial cells. Thus, . subtilis CW14 is a potential candidate as a food additive to protect against intestinal damage.Copyright © 2019.

However, few reports have studied on its GI toxicity. Magnolol (MG), one of the mainly active constituents in Magnolia, has been reported to treat digestive diseases. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the intestinal protective effect of MG in OXL treatment group. OXL administration mice showed body weight loss, diarrhea, and intestinal damage characterized by the shortening of villi and destruction of intestinal crypts, as well as the colon length change. MG significantly reduced body weight loss, alleviated diarrhea, reversed histopathological changes, and prevented colon length reduction. Oxidative stress and inflammation were activated after OXL, and these responses were repressed by MG through increasing the activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione, decreasing level of nuclear factor of kappa  and downregulating the following pro-inflammatory cytokines. Although the expression of tight junction protein occludin and numbers of proliferative crypt cells were reduced on ileum and colon after OXL, MG administration promoted these expressions. The fecal gut microbiota composition disturbed by OXL was significantly reversed by MG. Thus, MG could prevent the development and progression of mucositis induced by oxaliplatin through multipathway.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30066013>The epithelial barrier-protecting properties of a soy hydrolysate.</a></h2><p>Enhancing the epithelial barrier function could be a possible strategy to prevent food allergy or reduce its symptoms. Soy hydrolysates containing bioactive peptides could be instrumental in this. In this study, the protective effects of pretreatment with 6 soy hydrolysates on calcium ionophore A23187-induced TEER reduction were studied in T84 cells. The effects of the most potent soy hydrolysate on  gene expression were studied. In order to identify the underlying pathways involved, the barrier disruptor specificity of the effect was studied by comparing the protective effects on TEER and Lucifer Yellow flux after the exposure to barrier disruptors that work via different intracellular pathways, i.e. the disruptors A23187, mellitin, and deoxynivalenol (DON). Preincubation with one of the six hydrolysates protected the epithelial cells from a decrease in TEER induced by A23187 (restored to 105% of the starting point, while A23187 alone decreased to 53% of the starting value) and mellitin (restored to 11% of the starting point, while mellitin alone decreased to 3.8% of the starting value). This soy hydrolysate was found to increase claudin-1 and decrease claudin-2 expression. The protective effect of the hydrolysate on TEER was specific for the barrier disruptors A23187 and mellitin, but was not observed for DON. This observation suggests that the soy hydrolysate may act via PKC isoforms, which are known to lead to changes in the expression of claudin-1 and 2. Our data suggest that specific soy hydrolysates may be designed to strengthen the epithelial barrier which might be instrumental in the management of the barrier function in individuals at risk of developing food allergy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31084433>Vitamin A and vitamin D regulate the microbial complexity, barrier function, and the mucosal immune responses to ensure intestinal homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Diet is an important regulator of the gastrointestinal microbiota. Vitamin A and vitamin D deficiencies result in less diverse, dysbiotic microbial communities and increased susceptibility to infection or injury of the gastrointestinal tract. The vitamin A and vitamin D receptors are nuclear receptors expressed by the host, but not the microbiota. Vitamin A- and vitamin D-mediated regulation of the intestinal epithelium and mucosal immune cells underlies the effects of these nutrients on the microbiota. Vitamin A and vitamin D regulate the expression of  proteins on intestinal epithelial cells that are critical for barrier function in the gut. Other shared functions of vitamin A and vitamin D include the support of innate lymphoid cells that produce IL-22, suppression of IFN-γ and IL-17 by T cells, and induction of regulatory T cells in the mucosal tissues. There are some unique functions of vitamin A and D; for example, vitamin A induces gut homing receptors on T cells, while vitamin D suppresses gut homing receptors on T cells. Together, vitamin A- and vitamin D-mediated regulation of the intestinal epithelium and mucosal immune system shape the microbial communities in the gut to maintain homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30979002>Synbiotic Supplementation Containing Whole Plant Sugar Cane Fibre and Probiotic Spores Potentiates Protective Synergistic Effects in Mouse Model of IBD.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are a chronic inflammatory disorders with increasing global incidence. Synbiotic, which is a two-point approach carrying probiotic and prebiotic components in mitigating inflammation in IBD, is thought to be a pragmatic approach owing to the synergistic outcomes. In this study, the impacts of dietary supplementation with probiotic  MTCC5856 spores () and prebiotic whole plant sugar cane fibre (PSCF) was assessed using a murine model of IBD. Eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal chow diet supplemented with either , PSCF or its synbiotic combination. After seven days of supplementation, colitis was induced with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for seven days during the continuation of the supplemented diets. Synbiotic supplementation ameliorated disease activity index and histological score (-72%, 7.38, respectively), more effectively than either  (-47%, 10.1) and PSCF (-53%, 13.0) alone. Synbiotic supplementation also significantly ( < 0.0001) prevented the expression of  proteins and modulated the altered serum IL-1β (-40%), IL-10 (+26%), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (-39%) levels. Synbiotic supplementations also raised the short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) profile more extensively compared to the unsupplemented DSS-control. The synbiotic health outcome effect of the probiotic and prebiotic combinations may be associated with a synergistic direct immune-regulating efficacy of the components, their ability to protect epithelial integrity, stimulation of probiotic spores by the prebiotic fibre, and/or with stimulation of greater levels of fermentation of fibres releasing SCFAs that mediate the reduction in colonic inflammation. Our model findings suggest synbiotic supplementation should be tested in clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30903547>Sodium Butyrate Ameliorates Intestinal Injury and Improves Survival in a Rat Model of Cecal Ligation and Puncture-Induced Sepsis.</a></h2><p>Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with a high rate of mortality. Unfortunately, very few therapies can improve outcomes in patients with sepsis. Butyrate, which is the most potent histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor among short-chain fatty acids, exerts anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of inflammatory diseases. Butyrate might thus be valuable in the treatment of sepsis, in which inhibition of overwhelming cytokine release is vitally important. Sepsis was induced in 7- to 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) with a 21-g double-puncture technique. Rats received an intravenous injection of normal saline (vehicle) or sodium butyrate (200 mg/kg) after CLP and were sacrificed 12 h later. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to observe the intestinal mucosal morphology. RT-PCR and ELISA were used to determine the intestinal inflammatory response in vivo. Intestinal permeability was evaluated by measuring fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FD-4) absorption in vivo, and tight junction protein expression was examined by western blot. NF-κ p65 activities were assessed by western blot and immunohistochemistry. Sodium butyrate treatment improved the survival rate of CLP rats and alleviated sepsis-induced intestinal mucosal injury. Proinflammatory cytokine expression was lower in butyrate-treated rats than in the vehicle group. FD-4 leakage from the intestinal tract was reduced, and the expression levels of the tight junction proteins claudin-1 and ZO-1 were also restored in rats that received sodium butyrate treatment. These effects were associated with less NF-κ p65 nuclear translocation, whereas the expression of Iκ-α was not affected or even increased. Sodium butyrate mitigates the inflammatory response and maintains intestinal   in polymicrobial sepsis partly through inhibition of NF-κ activation and may serve as a novel therapy for sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31212760>Effects of Dietary Zearalenone on Oxidative Stress, Cell Apoptosis, and  in the Intestine of Juvenile Grass Carp ().</a></h2><p>Zearalenone (ZEA) is a prevalent mycotoxin with high toxicity in animals.

Total dependence on parenteral nutrition (PN) is associated with numerous adverse effects, including severe microbial dysbiosis and loss of important butyrate producers. We hypothesised that a lack of butyrate produced by the gut microbiota may be compensated by its supplementation in PN mixtures. We tested whether  butyrate administration would (a) positively modulate intestinal defence mechanisms and () counteract PN-induced dysbiosis. Male Wistar rats were randomised to chow, PN, and PN supplemented with 9 mM butyrate (PN+But) for 12 days. Antimicrobial peptides, mucins,  proteins, and cytokine expression were assessed by RT-qPCR. T-cell subpopulations in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were analysed by flow cytometry. Microbiota composition was assessed in caecum content. Butyrate supplementation resulted in increased expression of  proteins (), antimicrobial peptides (), and lysozyme in the ileal mucosa. Butyrate partially alleviated PN-induced intestinal barrier impairment and normalised IL-4, IL-10, and IgA mRNA expression. PN administration was associated with an increase in Tregs in MLN, which was normalised by butyrate. Butyrate increased the total number of CD4+ and decreased a relative amount of CD8+ memory T cells in MLN. Lack of enteral nutrition and PN administration led to a shift in caecal microbiota composition. Butyrate did not reverse the altered expression of most taxa but did influence the abundance of some potentially beneficial/pathogenic genera, which might contribute to its overall beneficial effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30284629>Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) latent protein LANA modulates cellular genes associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.</a></h2><p>Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) is a gammaherpesvirus associated with Kaposi's sarcoma and various lymphoproliferative diseases. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important step in the metastasis of cancer cells. Previous studies have shown an important role for EMT markers in -cell malignancies. In the present study, we investigated the role of the KSHV latent protein LANA in the progression of EMT. Our data suggest that expression of LANA results in an increase in the migration and invasion potential of cancer cells, which is concurrent with modulation of transcriptional regulation and protein expression of several cellular genes associated with EMT. LANA expression results in upregulation of the cellular intermediate filament protein vimentin and transcription factor TCF8/ZEB1 and downregulation of  protein ZO1 and adhesion protein E-cadherin. LANA co-localizes with TCF8/ZEB1, a major contributor in EMT, further suggesting an important role for LANA in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of KSHV-infected cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30390674>Babesia bovis RON2 contains conserved -cell epitopes that induce an invasion-blocking humoral immune response in immunized cattle.</a></h2><p>Babesia bovis belongs to the phylum Apicomplexa and is the major causal agent of bovine babesiosis, the most important veterinary disease transmitted by arthropods. In apicomplexan parasites, the interaction between AMA1 and RON2 is necessary for the invasion process, and it is a target for vaccine development. In . bovis, the existence of AMA1 has already been reported; however, the presence of a homolog of RON2 is unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize RON2 in . bovis.The . bovis ron2 gene has a similar synteny with the orthologous gene in the . bigemina genome. The entire ron2 gene was sequenced from different . bovis strains showing > 99% similarity at the amino acid and nucleotide level among all the sequences obtained, including the characteristic CLAG domain for cytoadherence in the amino acid sequence, as is described in other Apicomplexa. The in silico transcription analysis showed similar levels of transcription between attenuated and virulent . bovis strains, and expression of RON2 was confirmed by western blot in the . bovis T3Bo virulent strain. Four conserved peptides, containing predicted -cell epitopes in hydrophilic regions of the protein, were designed and chemically synthesized.

Further, blue light-emitting diode (LED) light (BLL)-induced retinal toxicity plays an important role in retinal degeneration. Here, we demonstrate that low-luminance BLL enhances phototoxicity in A2E-laden RPE cells and rats. RPE cells were subjected to synthetic A2E, and the effects of BLL on activation of apoptotic biomarkers were examined by measuring the levels of cleaved caspase-3. BLL modulates the protein expression of zonula-occludens 1 (ZO-1) and paracellular permeability in A2E-laden RPE cells. Early inflammatory and angiogenic genes were also screened after short-term BLL exposure. In this study, we developed a rat model for A2E treatment with or without BLL exposure for 21 days. BLL exposure caused fundus damage, decreased total retinal thickness, and caused neuron transduction injury in the retina, which were consistent with the in vitro data. We suggest that the synergistic effects of BLL and A2E accumulation in the retina increase the risk of retinal degeneration.

This study investigates the effect and mechanism of HA on the differentiation of NECs. The experiment cultures human NECs in four conditions, namely controls, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, TGF-β1 + HA and HA groups. In the TGF group, the NECs become irregular shape without formation of  and mucociliary differentiation of NECs is inhibited. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of NECs also occurs in the TGF group. However, with addition of HA in TGF groups, NECs reveal the mucociliary phenotypes of epithelial cells with  expression. Incubation of TGF-β1 in an NEC culture leads to an increase in phosphorylated type 1 TGF-β receptors (p-TβRI). This increase is attenuated when NECs are cultured in the presence of HA. Similar expressions are observed in phosphorylated smad2/smad3. Additionally, HA-dependent inhibition of TGF-β1 signalling is inhibited by co-incubation with a blocking antibody to CD44. Experimental results indicate that HA can antagonize TGF-β1 effect on EMT and mucociliary differentiation of NECs by down-regulation of TβR I, which is via CD44.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974041>Mussel adhesive protein fused with VE-cadherin extracellular domain promotes endothelial-cell  and in vivo endothelization recovery of vascular stent.</a></h2><p>Improving the surface properties of vascular stents to accelerate endothelialization in vivo could play an important role in minimizing the risk of late thrombosis.

We then evaluated the effect of VE-M on endothelialization recovery in vivo through implantation of vascular stents. At 1 day after implantation, stents coated with VE-M recruited more endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) than bare stents. At 7 days after implantation, VE-M stents had a greater coverage of ECs than bare stents. At 1 month after implantation, ECs on VE-M stents were appropriately elliptical in morphology and closely resembled physiological morphology. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining revealed little in-stent neointima formation on VE-M stents, and SEM images revealed that smooth endothelium had formed on VE-M stents without adherent platelets. Taken together, these findings indicate that VE-M accelerates in vivo endothelialization of vascular stents via recruitment of EPCs and promotes endothelium formation and could be explored as a potential bioactive coating for vascular implant.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Metformin improves intestinal barrier function, although the underlying mechanism has yet to be fully explained. This study evaluates the protective effect of metformin on colonic barrier integrity and explores the underlying cellular mechanisms.IBS-like rats were induced by maternal separation. Metformin was administered daily by gavage at 08:30, and rat pups were then separated from their mother. Visceral hyperalgesia and depression-like behaviors were evaluated by colorectal distension, sucrose preference tests, and forced swimming tests. Intestinal integrity was analyzed using sugar probes and transmission electron microscopy. Inflammatory factors and the levels of corticotropin-releasing factor were assessed by PCR and ELISA. The number of mast cells was evaluated by toluidine blue staining. Protein expression and localization were determined using Western blot and immunochemistry.Metformin pretreatment (a) reduced visceral hypersensitivity to colorectal distension, immobility time and enhanced sucrose consumption; () decreased urine lactulose/mannitol ratio and sucralose output; (c) inhibited the dilation of  and prevented claudin-4 translocation; (d) inhibited mast cell activation and downregulated the expression of IL-6, IL-18, tryptase, PAR-2, and ERK activation; (e) inhibited claudin-4 phosphorylation at serine sites and interactions between clau-4 and ZO-1.Metformin may block mast cell activation to reduce PAR-2 expression and subsequently inhibit ERK activation and clau-4 phosphorylation at serine sites to normalize the interaction of clau-4 and ZO-1 and clau-4 distribution. Metformin may be clinically beneficial for patients with IBS or IBS-like symptoms.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30870435>Defining the role of NG2-expressing cells in experimental models of multiple sclerosis. A biofunctional analysis of the neurovascular unit in wild type and NG2 null mice.</a></h2><p>During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis associated with blood-brain  (BBB) disruption, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) overexpress proteoglycan nerve/glial antigen 2 (NG2), proliferate, and make contacts with the microvessel wall. To explore whether OPCs may actually be recruited within the neurovascular unit (NVU), de facto intervening in its cellular and molecular composition, we quantified by immunoconfocal morphometry the presence of OPCs in contact with brain microvessels, during postnatal cerebral cortex vascularization at postnatal day 6, in wild-type (WT) and NG2 knock-out (NG2KO) mice, and in the cortex of adult naïve and EAE-affected WT and NG2KO mice. As observed in WT mice during postnatal development, a higher number of juxtavascular and perivascular OPCs was revealed in adult WT mice during EAE compared to adult naïve WT mice. In EAE-affected mice, OPCs were mostly associated with microvessels that showed altered claudin-5 and occludin tight junction (TJ) staining patterns and  leakage. In contrast, EAE-affected NG2KO mice, which did not show any significant increase in vessel-associated OPCs, seemed to retain better preserved TJs and BBB integrity. As expected, absence of NG2, in both OPCs and pericytes, led to a reduced content of vessel basal lamina molecules, laminin, collagen VI, and collagen IV. In addition, analysis of the major ligand/receptor systems known to promote OPC proliferation and migration indicated that vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA), and the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) were the molecules most likely involved in proliferation and recruitment of vascular OPCs during EAE. These results were confirmed by real time-PCR that showed Fgf2, Pdgfa and Tgfb expression on isolated cerebral cortex microvessels and by dual RNAscope-immunohistochemistry/in situ hybridization (IHC/ISH), which detected Vegfa and Vegfr2 transcripts on cerebral cortex sections. Overall, this study suggests that vascular OPCs, in virtue of their developmental arrangement and response to neuroinflammation and growth factors, could be integrated among the classical NVU cell components. Moreover, the synchronized activation of vascular OPCs and pericytes during both BBB development and dysfunction, points to NG2 as a key regulator of vascular interactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31367840>Changes of Blood-Brain Barrier and Brain Parenchymal Protein Expression Levels of Mice under Different Insulin-Resistance Conditions Induced by High-Fat Diet.</a></h2><p>The purpose of the present study was to investigate changes of blood-brain barrier (BBB) and brain parenchymal protein expression due to type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) by using SWATH-based quantitative proteomics.Mice were fed a HFD for 2 or 10 weeks, and then SWATH-based quantitative proteomic analysis, western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry and functional transport studies were performed.In brain capillaries, expression levels of BBB transporters (Glut1, P-glycoprotein) and  proteins (claudin-5, occludin) were significantly reduced in HFD mice at 2 weeks, but recovered to the levels in the normal diet (ND) group at 10 weeks. P-glycoprotein function at the BBB was reduced at 2 weeks. In the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, neurofilament, which is important for neuronal function, was decreased in HFD mice at 2 weeks, but recovered at 10 weeks.Our results suggest that changes in the status of insulin resistance influence expression of BBB transporters, which in turn may alter the expression of cognitive function-related proteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30130441>AMPK in regulation of apical  and barrier function of intestinal epithelium.</a></h2><p>Gut epithelium covers the inner layer of the gastrointestinal tract and provides a physical barrier to separate the host from its external environment, and its barrier function is critical for maintaining host health. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as a master regulator of energy metabolism plays a critical role in epithelial barrier function. AMPK activation promotes epithelial differentiation and facilitates cell polarity establishment, both of which strengthen epithelial barrier. In addition, AMPK promotes the assembly of  and adherens  by direct phosphorylation of proteins composing apical , junctional anchors, and cytoskeletons. Pharmacological and nutraceutical compounds, as well as physiological states triggering AMPK activation strengthen epithelial barrier function.

The present study aimed to explain the possible mechanism of the positive effect of Arg on intestinal epithelial cells of grass carp. An in vitro study was conducted through a primary culture model to assess the growth, cell viability, mRNA expressions of TOR signal pathway, and  proteins of enterocytes after culture in the medium with 6 levels of Arg (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mmol/L). The results showed that 0.5 mmol/L Arg improved the cell number and decreased the lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities in culture medium (P < 0.05). The alkaline phosphatase activity in cell lysis buffer was depressed by 1 and 2 mmol/L Arg (P < 0.05). The nitric oxide (NO) content showed an increasing trend with the Arg content (P < 0.05), whereas the NO synthase activity showed an opposite trend to NO. TOR expression was higher in 0.2 and 0.5 mmol/L groups, whereas S6K1 expression in 1.0 mmol/L and 2.0 mmol/L groups were lower (P < 0.05). The mRNA expressions of occludin, claudin 3, and claudin c in 0.5 mmol/L group were the highest, while ZO-1 and claudin  expressions were higher in 0.2 and 0.5 mmol/L groups (P < 0.05). This study indicated that Arg enhanced the growth and integrity of intestinal epithelial cells of grass carp through upregulation of mRNA expression of TOR signal pathway and  proteins at an optimal Arg content of 0.2-0.5 mmol/L.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29938270>Artificial sweetener saccharin disrupts intestinal epithelial cells' barrier function in vitro.</a></h2><p>Consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) is a dietary practice used by those who wish to lose weight or by patients on a sugar-restricted diet such as those with DM2. Although these substances are safe, possible biological interactions with the digestive tract, particularly in relation to intestinal permeability, have not been studied. Thus, the current work sought to investigate the action of different NNS on intestinal permeability using an in vitro Caco-2 cell model.Caco-2 cells were incubated with acesulfame K, aspartame, saccharin, or sucralose at equimolar concentrations. Acesulfame K, aspartame, and sucralose did not disrupt monolayer integrity in the cells. However, saccharin increased paracellular permeability and decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) via a non-cytotoxic mechanism. The levels of the  protein claudin-1 were reduced in Caco-2 cells that had previously been exposed to saccharin. The inhibition of nuclear factor-κ (NF-κ) was able to prevent the reduction in TEER induced by saccharin treatment. Thalidomide, as an inhibitor of ubiquitin ligase, was able to prevent the decrease in claudin-1 protein expression and the TEER reduction in Caco-2 cells.Saccharin disrupts monolayer integrity and alters paracellular permeability in a Caco-2 cell monolayer model, via a mechanism involving NF-κ activation, resulting in the ubiquitination of the  protein claudin-1.

Treatment of UC would benefit from specific targeting of therapeutics to the intestine. Previous studies have demonstrated that bovine lactoferricin and lactoferrampin have bactericidal, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. Here, we investigated whether oral administration of a bovine lactoferricin-lactoferrampin (LFCA)-encoding Lactococcus lactis (LL-LFCA) strain could alleviate experimental colitis. LFCA derived from LL-LFCA inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in vitro. In mice, administration of LL-LFCA decreased the disease activity index and attenuated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced body weight loss and colon shortening. LL-LFCA treatment also ameliorated DSS-induced colon damage, inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration, significantly decreased myeloperoxidase activity, and ameliorated DSS-induced disruption of intestinal permeability and . In addition, 16S rDNA sequencing showed that LL-LFCA reversed DSS-induced gut dysbiosis. The production of proinflammatory mediators in serum and the colon was also reduced by administration of LL-LFCA. In vitro, LFCA derived from LL-LFCA decreased the messenger RNA expression of proinflammatory factors. The underlying mechanisms may involve inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) pathway. The results demonstrate that LL-LFCA ameliorates DSS-induced intestinal injury in mice, suggesting that LL-LFCA might be an effective drug for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30334462>Borneol, a messenger agent, improves central nervous system drug delivery through enhancing blood-brain barrier permeability: a preclinical systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>To achieve sufficient blood-brain barrier (BBB), penetration is one of the biggest challenges in the development of diagnostic and therapeutic for central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the preclinical evidence and possible mechanisms of borneol for improving co-administration of CNS drug delivery in animal models. The electronic literature search was conducted in six databases. Fifty-eight studies with 63 comparisons involved 1137 animals were included. Among 47 studies reporting the assessments of CNS drug concentration, 45 studies showed the significant effects of borneol for improving CNS drug delivery (p<.05), whereas 2 studies showed no difference (p>.05). Nineteen comparisons showed borneol up-regulated BBB permeability (p<.05) using brain EB content (n = 8), Rh 123 content (n = 4), brain imaging agent content (n = 2), brain water content (n = 1) and observing ultrastructure of BBB (n = 4), whereas three studies showed no difference or unclear results. Seven studies reported the safety, in which one study showed borneol was reversible changes in the BBB penetration; six studies showed borneol did not increase co-administration of blood drugs concentration of peripheral tissues (p > .05). Effects of borneol are closely associated with inhibition of efflux protein function, releasement of  protein, increasement of vasodilatory neurotransmitters, and inhibition of active transport by ion channels. In conclusion, borneol is a promising candidate for CNS drug delivery, mainly through mediating a multi-targeted BBB permeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569788>Anti-Inflammatory Mechanisms of Koreanaside A, a Lignan Isolated from the Flower of , against LPS-Induced Macrophage Activation and DSS-Induced Colitis Mice: The Crucial Role of AP-1, NF-κ, and JAK/STAT Signaling.</a></h2><p>The current treatment options for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are unsatisfactory. Therefore, novel and safer therapies are needed. We previously reported that koreanaside A (KA) showed high radical scavenging activity and suppressed vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in its anti-inflammatory effect have not been reported. KA inhibited pro-inflammatory mediators such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E (PGE). KA inhibited the production and mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) induced by LPS. KA downregulated the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent inflammatory gene expressions in the MyD88-overexpressed cells. KA suppressed the LPS-induced transcriptional and DNA-binding activities of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ). KA was found to inhibit the phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1/2 (JAK1/2) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 1/3 (STAT1/3). In DSS-induced colitis mice, KA relieved the symptoms of colitis by suppressing inflammatory cell infiltration, restoring  (TJ)- and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related protein expression, and inactivating AP-1, NF-κ, and STAT1/3. Therefore, KA reduced inflammatory responses by downregulating AP-1, NF-κ, and JAK/STAT signaling in LPS-induced macrophages and DSS-induced colitis mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30711207>Nondietary Therapies for Celiac Disease.</a></h2><p>Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy triggered by gluten.

Despite this opportunity, identification of protein-protein interfaces remains challenging. We have previously developed a method that relies on coating protein surfaces with small-molecule dyes to discriminate between solvent-accessible protein surfaces and hidden interface regions. Dye-bound, solvent-accessible protein regions resist trypsin digestion, whereas hidden interface regions are revealed by denaturation and sequenced by MS. The small-molecule dyes bind promiscuously and with high affinity, but their binding mechanism is unknown. Here, we report on the optimization of a novel dye probe used in protein painting, Fast Blue  + naphthionic acid, and show that its affinity for proteins strongly depends on hydrophobic moieties that we call here "hydrophobic clamps." We demonstrate the utility of this probe by sequencing the protein-protein interaction regions between the Hippo pathway protein Yes-associated protein 2 (YAP2) and  protein 1 (TJP1 or ZO-1), uncovering interactions via the known binding domain as well as ZO-1's MAGUK domain and YAP's N-terminal proline-rich domain. Additionally, we demonstrate how residues predicted by protein painting are present exclusively in the complex interface and how these residues may guide the development of peptide inhibitors using a case study of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). Inhibitors designed around the PD-1/PD-L1 interface regions identified via protein painting effectively disrupted complex formation, with the most potent inhibitor having an IC of 5 μm.© 2019 Haymond et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260736>Dietary sodium butyrate (Butirex C4) supplementation modulates intestinal transcriptomic responses and augments disease resistance of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).</a></h2><p>Intestine in fish is a complex multifunctional organ, not only plays roles in digestion and absorption of nutrient, but also has critical role in immunity. The present study evaluated the effects of different levels of dietary sodium butyrate [Butirex C4 (Butirex)] on intestinal immune-,antioxidant-and -related gene expression injuvenile rainbow trout(Oncorhynchusmykiss). 240 healthy rainbow trout were dispensed in 12 fiberglass tanks appointed to four treatments [0 (control), 1.5 (B1.5), 2.5 (B2.5) and 5 (B5)g Butirex per kg diet]. After a 45-day feeding trial, the fish fed with the Butirex-supplemented diets showed higher intestinal lysozyme (LYZ), complement(ACH50) and bactericidal activities; the elevations in ACH50 and bactericidal activities depended on Butirex levels (P < 0.05). The Butirex-supplemented groups, particularly the B2.5 group, had significantly higher LYZ gene expression compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Butirex at 2.5 and 5 g/kg levels led to significantly higher IL-1β gene expression. B2.5 and B5 had significantly lower and higher TNF-α gene expression compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The B2.5 group had significantly higher TGF-, and significantly lower IL-8 compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The B1.5 and B2.5 group had significantly higher IL-10 gene expression compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The B2.5 and B5 groups had significantly higher SOD gene expression compared to the other groups; the highest expression was related to the B2.5 group (P < 0.05). Dietary Butirex supplementation significantly up-regulated CAT and GPx genes expression compared to the control group; the highest expression as related to the B2.5 and B5 groups (P < 0.05). The B2.5 group had significantly lower CLD12 gene expression compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The B2.5 and B5 groups had significantly higher CLD3, OCLD and ZO-1 gene expression compared to the control. The highest CLD3, ZO-1 gene expressions was related to the B2.5, and B5 groups respectively (P < 0.05). After challenge with Streptococcus iniae, B2.5 and B5 had significantly higher survival compared to the control group (55.6 ± 7.70 and 68.9 ± 10.2 vs. 33.3 ± 6.67). In conclusion, Butirex is efficient immune stimulant and health booster in rainbow trout, which augments the fish resistance to disease. Modulation of immune components, cytokines, antioxidant system and intestinal integrity might involve in improving disease resistance in Butirex-treated fish. Although most of the examined genes were modulated by 2.5 g/kg Butirex under normal conditions, 5 g/kg level is recommended under pathogenic state to mitigate mortality.Copyright © 2019.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of Bifidobacterium longum LC67, Lactobacillus plantarum LC27, and their mixture (LM) against ethanol-induced steatosis in mice. Exposure to ethanol caused liver damage: it increased ALT, AST, TG, TC, and lipopolysaccharide levels in the blood and induced NF-κ activation in the liver. Oral administration of LC27, LC67, or LM in mice reduced ethanol-induced ALT, AST, TG, and TC levels in the blood and liver. These also suppressed ethanol-induced NF-κ activation and α-smooth muscle actin expression in the liver and increased ethanol-suppressed AMPK activation. Treatment with LC27, LC67, or LM increased ethanol-suppressed alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activities in the liver, as well as  protein expression in the liver and colon. Moreover, treatment with LC27, LC67, or LM restored the ethanol-disturbed gut microbiota composition, such as the increased population of Proteobacteria, and inhibited fecal and blood lipopolysaccharide levels. These inhibited NF-κ activation and increased  protein expression in ethanol- or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated Caco-2 cells.

Endothelial permeability is regulated by interaction between endothelial cells and ECM proteins. Fibronectin (FN) is a principal ECM component of microvessels. Excessive FN deposition disrupts cell-cell adhesion in fibroblasts through β1 integrin ligation. To determine whether excessive FN deposition contributes to the disruption of endothelial integrity, we used an in vitro model of the endothelial monolayer to investigate whether the FN inhibitor pUR4 prevents FN deposition into the subendothelial matrix and attenuates endothelial leakage.To correlate the effects of excessive FN accumulation in microvessels on BSCB disruption, spinal nerve ligation-which induces BSCB leakage-was applied, and FN expression in the spinal cord was evaluated through immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. To elucidate the effects by which pUR4 modulates endothelial permeability, brain-derived endothelial (bEND.3) cells treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were used to mimic a leaky BSCB. A bEND.3 monolayer was preincubated with pUR4 before TNF-α treatment. The transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurement and transendothelial permeability assay were applied to assess the endothelial integrity of the bEND.3 monolayer. Immunofluorescence analysis and immunoblotting were performed to evaluate the inhibitory effects of pUR4 on TNF-α-induced FN deposition. To determine the mechanisms underlying pUR4-mediated endothelial permeability, cell morphology, stress fiber formation, myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, and β1 integrin-mediated signaling were evaluated through immunofluorescence analysis and immunoblotting.Excessive FN was accumulated in the microvessels of the spinal cord after spinal nerve ligation; moreover, pUR4 inhibited TNF-α-induced FN deposition in the bEND.3 monolayer and maintained intact TEER and endothelial permeability. Furthermore, pUR4 reduced cell morphology alteration, actin stress fiber formation, and MLC phosphorylation, thereby attenuating paracellular gap formation. Moreover, pUR4 reduced β1 integrin activation and downstream signaling.pUR4 reduces TNF-α-induced β1 integrin activation by depleting ECM FN, leading to a decrease in endothelial hyperpermeability and maintenance of monolayer integrity. These findings suggest therapeutic benefits of pUR4 in pathological vascular leakage treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839193>Neuroprotective Effects of BHDPC, a Novel Neuroprotectant, on Experimental Stroke by Modulating Microglia Polarization.</a></h2><p>This study mainly investigated the therapeutic effects of BHDPC on ischemic stroke and its underlying mechanisms. In vivo, the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used to induce ischemic model. In vitro, oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced ischemic stroke in BV-2 microglia and primary neurons, and bEnd.3 mouse cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) were also used. First, we found that BHDPC exerts considerable neuroprotection against MCAO-induced ischemic injury to mice via alleviating neurological deficits and brain infarcts, inhibiting neuronal cell loss and apoptosis, and attenuating blood-brain barrier disruption and  protein changes. Next, we observed that BHDPC significantly reduced microglial M1 activation but enhanced M2 polarization in MCAO-induced ischemic brain. Further experiments in vitro indicated that BHDPC suppressed microglial activation but promoted M2 microglial polarization in OGD/R-induced BV-2 microglia. In addition, conditioned medium (CM) experiments showed that CM from BHDPC-treated BV-2 microglia provided protections against OGD/R-induced ischemic damage in primary neurons and bEnd.3 ECs. Moreover, we found that BHDPC actions on microglial inflammation were associated with the inactivation of NF-κ signaling. Interestingly, we also found that BHDPC enhanced phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA) and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). The pharmacological inhibition or gene knockdown of PKA/CREB signaling diminished BHDPC-promoted microglial M2 polarization. In summary, BHDPC conferred neuroprotection against ischemic injury in experimental stroke models. Modulating microglial activation and polarization contributes to BHDPC-mediated neuroprotective actions, which in part were mediated by nuclear factor kappa  and PKA/CREB signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31026484>Nontoxic concentrations of OTA aggravate DON-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction in IPEC-J2 cells via activation of NF-κ signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Deoxynivalenol (DON) is well-known enteropathogenic mycotoxin which can alter intestinal barrier functions. Consistently, Ochratoxin A (OTA) ingestion has been found to induce intestinal injuries, including inflammation and diarrhea. However, little is known whether OTA aggravates DON-induced toxicity. This study is designed to explore the effects of OTA on DON-induced intestinal barrier function and involved mechanism. Our results showed either DON or OTA could disrupt intestinal barrier function in a time- and dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and increased paracellular permeability to 4 kDa dextran. However, to eliminate the involvement of cell death, nonlethal concentrations of DON and OTA were used in following experiments. The nontoxic concentration of OTA was observed to aggravate DON-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction, accompanied with  disruption (Claudin-3 and Claudin-4). Moreover, nontoxic concentrations of OTA aggravated DON-induced up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and activated nuclear factor-κ (NF-κ) in IPEC-J2 cells. Adding NF-κ inhibitor (PDTC) alleviated the aggravating effects of nontoxic concentrations of OTA on DON-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction and inflammation. These findings indicate that nontoxic concentrations of OTA promoted DON-induced barrier dysfunction via NF-κ signaling pathway. Our experiment suggests that exposure to nontoxic concentrations of toxins also poses potentially harmful effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

BBB dysfunction in an ischemic stroke, results in brain injury and subsequent neurological impairment. The aim of this study was to determine the possible protective effects of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1, 25(OH)D, 1, 25-D, vit D] on BBB dysfunction, at the early stages of an acute ischemic brain injury. We analyzed the effects of 1, 25-D on BBB integrity in terms of histopathological changes, the neurological deficit, infarct size and the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), in a middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) rat model. BBB permeability and the expression of permeability-related proteins in the brain were also evaluated by Evans blue (EB) staining and Western blotting respectively. To determine the possible mechanism underlying the role of 1, 25-D in BBB maintenance, after MCAO/R, the rats were treated with the specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) inhibitor GW9662. Supplementation with 1, 25-D markedly improved the neurological scores of the rats, decreased the infarct volume, prevented neuronal deformation and upregulated the expression of the  (TJ) and BDNF proteins in their brains. Furthermore, it activated PPARγ but downregulated neuro-inflammatory cytokines such as nuclear factor kappa- (NF-κ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), after MCAO/R.

Currently, there is no standard for laser settings to achieve a feasible therapy. The cutaneous recovery following laser treatment and its influence on drug absorption have not been well explored. This study evaluated the kinetics of laser-treated skin-barrier restoration and drug permeation in nude mice. The skin recovery and observation of the process were characterized by transdermal water loss (TEWL), erythema measurement, gross appearance, optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The skin absorption of a lipophilic small permeant (tretinoin), a hydrophilic small permeant (acyclovir), and a large molecule (fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran 4 kDa, FD4) was examined in vitro using Franz cell. TEWL suggested that the laser-treated skin restored its barrier function at 16 h after irradiation. The fractional laser produced microchannels of about 150 μm in diameter and 25 μm in depth that were surrounded with thermal coagulation. The bright-field imaging indicated that the micropores were progressively closed during the recovery period but had not completely closed even after a 16-h recovery. The laser treatment led to a rapid tretinoin penetration across the skin immediately after irradiation, with a 5-fold enhancement compared to intact skin. This enhancement was gradually reduced following the increase of recovery time. Conversely, the acyclovir and FD4 permeation peaked at 1-2 h post-irradiation. The FD4 flux was even elevated as the recovery time increased. The reasons for this could have been the subsequent inflammation after laser exposure and the deficient  (TJ) barrier. The confocal imaging demonstrated the perpendicular diffusion of rhodamine  and FD4 through microchannels immediately after laser exposure. The lateral diffusion from the microchannels was observed at 2 h post-irradiation. Our results revealed a time-dependent recovery of skin permeation. The time frame for applying the drugs after laser irradiation was dependent upon the permeants and their various physicochemical properties.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

This study aimed to identify clinically relevant subgroups of CRS patients based on distinct microbial signatures, with a comparison to the commonly used phenotypic subgrouping approach. The underlying drivers of these distinct microbial clusters were also investigated, together with associations with epithelial barrier integrity. Sinus biopsy specimens were collected from CRS patients ( = 23) and disease controls ( = 8). The expression of 42  genes was evaluated using quantitative PCR together with microbiota analysis and immunohistochemistry for measuring mucosal integrity and inflammation. CRS patients clustered into two distinct microbial subgroups using probabilistic modelling Dirichlet (DC) multinomial mixtures. DC1 exhibited significantly reduced bacterial diversity and increased dispersion and was dominated by , , and  DC2 had significantly elevated  cells and incidences of nasal polyps and higher numbers of , , , , and  In addition, each DC exhibited distinct  gene and protein expression profiles compared with those of controls. Stratifying CRS patients based on clinical phenotypic subtypes (absence or presence of nasal polyps [CRSsNP or CRSwNP, respectively] or with cystic fibrosis [CRSwCF]) accounted for a larger proportion of the variation in the microbial data set than with DC groupings. However, no significant differences between CRSsNP and CRSwNP cohorts were observed for inflammatory markers, beta-dispersion, and alpha-diversity measures. In conclusion, both approaches used for stratifying CRS patients had benefits and pitfalls, but DC clustering provided greater resolution when studying  impairment. Future studies in CRS should give careful consideration to the patient subtyping approach used. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a major human health problem that significantly reduces quality of life. While various microbes have been implicated, there is no clear understanding of the role they play in CRS pathogenesis. Another equally important observation made for CRS patients is that the epithelial barrier in the sinonasal cavity is defective. Finding a robust approach to subtype CRS patients would be the first step toward unravelling the pathogenesis of this heterogeneous condition. Previous work has explored stratification based on the clinical presentation of the disease (with or without polyps), inflammatory markers, pathology, or microbial composition. Comparisons between the different stratification approaches used in these studies have not been possible due to the different cohorts, analytical methods, or sample sites used. In this study, two approaches for subtyping CRS patients were compared, and the underlying drivers of the heterogeneity in CRS were also explored.Copyright © 2019 Biswas et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31465827>Enhanced paracellular delivery of vaccine by hydrogel microparticles-mediated reversible  opening for effective oral immunization.</a></h2><p>The current conventional injectable vaccines face several drawbacks such as inconvenience and ineffectiveness in mucosal immunization. Therefore, the current development of effective oral vaccines is vital to enable the generation of dual systemic and mucosal immunity. In the present study, we examine the potential of pH-responsive bacterial nanocellulose/polyacrylic acid (BNC/PAA) hydrogel microparticles (MPs) as an oral vaccine carrier. In-vitro entrapment efficiency and release study of Ovalbumin (Ova) demonstrated that as high as 72% of Ova were entrapped in the hydrogel, and the release of loaded Ova was pH-dependent. The released Ova remained structurally conserved as evident by Western blot and circular dichroism. Hydrogel MPs reduced the TEER measurement of HT29MTX/Caco2/Raji  triple co-culture monolayer by reversibly opening the  (TJs) as shown in the TEM images. The ligated ileal loop assay revealed that hydrogel MPs could facilitate the penetration of FITC-Ova into the Peyer's patches in small intestine. Ova and cholera toxin  (CTB) were utilized in in-vivo oral immunization as model antigen and mucosal adjuvant. The in-vivo immunization revealed mice orally administered with Ova and CTB-loaded hydrogel MPs generated significantly higher level of serum anti-Ova IgG and mucosal anti-Ova IgA in the intestinal washes, compared to intramuscular administrated Ova. These results conclude that BNC/PAA hydrogel MPs is a potential oral vaccine carrier for effective oral immunization.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

In addition, it can increase insulin sensitivity, decrease blood glucose level and inhibit the apoptosis of endothelial cells. However, it remains unclear whether CTRP9 has beneficial effects on diabetic retinopathy (DR). An adenoviral vector expressing CTRP9 was intravenously injected into db/db mice, aged 12 weeks, at day 15 post injection, and the process was repeated. The transfection efficiency of CTRP9 was assessed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. We used RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blot to determine proinflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules and  proteins. The breakdown of blood-retinal barrier (BRB) was evaluated using Evans blue and retinal staining. CTRP9 suppresses the expression of interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and adhesion molecules in the retina of db/db mice. CTRP9 can balance the expression of pigment epithelium-derived factor and vascular endothelial growth factor. CTRP9 can also inhibit the activation of nuclear factor Kappa  in the retina of db/db mouse. In addition, CTRP9 can prevent the breakdown of BRB and downregulation of  proteins in the retina of db/db mice. Evans blue assay revealed the breakdown of BRB and vascular leakage in the retinas of diabetic mice. CTRP9 can both qualitatively and quantitatively alleviate the vascular leakage in the early stage of diabetic retinas. CTRP9 can inhibit the inflammation of diabetic retinopathy and protect blood-retinal barrier via decreasing proinflammatory cytokines and preventing the downregulation of  proteins.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

The VDR is activated by 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and plays an important role in maintaining integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier. LCA can also substitute for vitamin D to carry out the in vivo functions of vitamin D. However, it is unclear whether activation of the VDR by LCA affects mucosal barrier function. In the present study, we researched the protective effect of LCA on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction in Caco-2 cells of the human epithelial intestinal adenocarcinoma cell line. Caco-2 cell monolayers were pretreated with LCA and then exposed to 100 ng/mL TNF-α. The results showed that LCA alleviated the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in FITC-Dextran flux induced by TNF-α. LCA ameliorated the TNF-α-induced decrease in protein expression and distribution of ZO-1, E-cadherin, Occludin, and Claudin-1, which are  markers. Additionally, the LCA treatment effectively counteracted TNF-α-mediated downregulation of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1, which are related to oxidative stress. Increases in NF-κ p-p65 and p-Iκ-α induced by TNF-α were significantly inhibited by LCA. Considering all these, the present study indicates that LCA has a significant protective effect on TNF-α-induced injury of intestinal barrier function through the VDR and suggests that suppressing NF-κ signaling and activating the SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway might be one of the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of LCA.Copyright © 2019.

Glucose primarily moves from the blood to the ASL via paracellular movement, down its concentration gradient, across the . However, there is evidence that glucose can move transcellularly across epithelial cells. Using a Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) sensor for glucose, we investigated intracellular glucose concentrations in airway epithelial cells and the role of hexokinases in regulating intracellular glucose concentrations in normo- and hyperglycaemic conditions. Our findings indicated that in airway epithelial cells (H441 or primary human epithelial cells HBEC) exposed to 5mM glucose (normoglycaemia), intracellular glucose concentration is in the mM range. Inhibition of facilitative glucose transport (GLUT) with Cytochalasin  reduced intracellular glucose concentration. When cells were exposed to 15mM glucose (hyperglycaemia), intracellular glucose concentration reduced. Airway cells expressed hexokinases 1, 2 and 3. Inhibition with 3-bromopyruvate decreased hexokinase activity by ~25% and elevated intracellular glucose concentration but levels remained in the mM range. Exposure to hyperglycaemia increased glycolysis, glycogen and sorbitol. Thus, glucose enters the airway cell via GLUT transporters and is then rapidly processed by hexokinase-dependent and hexokinase-independent metabolic pathways to maintain low intracellular glucose concentrations. We propose this prevents transcellular transport, aids the removal of glucose from the ASL and that the main route of entry for glucose into the ASL is via the paracellular pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30336465>Mechanism for the Decision of Ovarian Surface Epithelial Stem Cells to Undergo Neo-Oogenesis or Ovarian Tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>The ovary is surrounded by a whitish layer of mesodermally derived ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) that lines the intraembryonic celom and comprises simple squamous to cuboidal to low pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells. Its integrity is maintained by simple desmosomes, incomplete , several integrins and cadherins. Recent research has found that ovarian stem cells (OSCs) exist within the OSE and may be responsible for both neo-oogenesis and ovarian cancer during adult life. The factors determining whether OSCs undergo neo-oogenesis or ovarian cancer are of great interest to researchers and clinicians. Accumulating evidence suggests the mechanism for the decision of ovarian surface epithelial stem cells to undergo either neo-oogenesis or ovarian cancer transformation may comprise both internal and external factors. Here, we review recent progress on how the internal factors, including genes, signaling pathways and lncRNA: OSE stem cells mediate the development and progression of ovarian cancer through various genes such as p53, KRAS, BRAF, and PTEN, and mutations in PIK3CA, and through various signaling pathways, including TGF- pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, Notch signaling pathway, NF-kB signal transducer and transcriptional activator 3 (STAT3) pathway and Hedghog (HH) pathway. A series of expressions of IncRNA have changed in epithelial ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines compared to normal ovarian tissues and cell lines. As well as external factors, including incessant ovulation, gonadotropin and chronicinflammation: Frequent ovulation, without long-term dormancy, increases the risk of illness, because repeated rupture and repair at the ovulation site provides an opportunity for the accumulation of genetic aberrations; FSH affects all aspects of ovarian cancer metastasis, such as inhibition of apoptosis, through Induction of increased expression of VEGFA (VEGF) to support tumor growth, promote vascular growth, and possibly alter certain oncogenic pathways, thereby promoting proliferation and invasive phenotypic inflammation contributes to tumorigenesis, which help determine whether OSCs undergo neo-oogenesis or ovarian tumorigenesis. Understanding this issue is critical for developing novel strategies for premature ovarian failure and ovarian cancer prevention and therapy.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

In the case of whole lung engineering, functionally endothelialized pulmonary vasculature is critical for establishing a fluid- barrier at the level of the alveolus, so that oxygen and carbon dioxide can be exchanged in the organ. We have previously developed a protocol to efficiently seed endothelial cells into the microvascular channels of decellularized lung scaffolds, but fully functional endothelial coverage, in terms of barrier function and resistance to thrombosis, was not achieved. In this study, we investigated whether various small molecules could favorably impact endothelial functionality after seeding into decellularized lung scaffolds. We demonstrated that the Epac-selective cAMP analog 8CPT-2Me-cAMP improves endothelial barrier function in repopulated lung scaffolds. When treated with the Epac agonist, barrier function of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) improved, and was maintained for at least three days, whereas the effect of other tested molecules lasted for only 5 h. Treatment with the Epac agonist re-organized actin structure, and appeared to increase the continuity of  proteins such as VE-cadherin and ZO1. Blockade of actin polymerization abolished the effect of the Epac agonist on barrier function and actin reorganization, confirming a strong actin-mediated effect. Similarly, after treatment with Epac agonist, the barrier function in iPSC-derived endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) was increased and the enhanced barrier was maintained for at least 60 h. After culture in lung scaffolds for 5 days, iPSC-ECFCs maintained their phenotype by expressing CD31, eNOS, vWF, and VE-Cadherin. Treatment with the Epac agonist significantly improved the barrier function of iPSC-ECFC-repopulated lung for at least 6 h. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that Epac-selective 8CPT-2Me-cAMP activation enhanced vascular barrier in iPSC-ECFC-engineered lungs, and may be useful to improve endothelial functionality for whole organ tissue engineering.Copyright © 2019.

Despite their significance to cell function, isolation of membrane proteins from their hydrophobic lipid environment and further characterization remains a challenge. To obtain insights into membrane proteins, computational approaches such as docking or self-assembly simulations have been used; however, the promise of these approaches has been limited due to the computational cost. Here we present a new approach called Protein AssociatioN Energy Landscape (PANEL) that provides an extensive and converged data set for all possible conformations of membrane protein associations using a combination of stochastic sampling and equilibration simulations. The PANEL method samples the rotational space around both interacting proteins to obtain the comprehensive interaction energy landscape. We demonstrate the versatility of the PANEL method using two distinct applications: (a) dimerization of claudin-5  proteins in phospholipid bilayer membrane and () dimer and trimer formation of the Outer membrane protein F (OmpF) in the lipopolysaccharide-rich bacterial outer membrane. Both applications required only a fraction of simulation cost compared to self-assembly simulations. The method is robust as it can capture changes in protein-protein conformations caused by point mutations. Moreover, the method is versatile and independent of the molecular resolution (atomistic or coarse grain) or the choice of force field employed to compute the pair-interaction energies. The PANEL method is implemented in easy-to-use scripts that are available for download for general use by the scientific community to characterize any pair of interacting integral membrane proteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30925220>Epithelial physical  defects in chronic rhinosinusitis.</a></h2><p>Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common upper airway disease with a prevalence of greater than 10% of the general population. Although the pathogenesis of CRS remains poorly understood, there is growing evidence indicating that epithelial physical  defects play an important role in CRS pathogenesis.

This review summarizes recent advances regarding the structure, , and regulating mechanisms of the epithelial physical  in the context of CRS. Expert opinion: Available data indicate that epithelial physical  defects in CRS can result from inhaled allergens, microbial or virus infections, cytokines, hypoxia, or zinc deficiency, among other causes. Several genes/molecules, such as SPINK5, S100A7, S100A8/9, PCDH1, NDRG1, SPRR, and p63 are involved in modulating the physical   in the context of CRS.

A 2 × 2 factorial design was used having OABF inclusion and avilamycin as main factors. Subsequently, 544 day-old male Cobb broilers were allocated in the following 4 treatments, each with 8 replicates: no additions (CON), 1 g OABF/kg diet (OA), 2.5 mg avilamycin/kg diet (AV) and combination of OA and AV (OAAV). The trial lasted for 42 days. In the ileum, OAAV resulted in lower mucosa-associated total bacteria levels (  = 0.028) compared with AV. In addition, ileal digesta levels of  subgroup were decreased by avilamycin (  = 0.045).

Barrier function results from  between brain capillary endothelial cells and high expression of active efflux transporters, including P-glycoprotein (Pgp), at the apical membrane of these cells. In addition to actively transporting drugs out of the cell, Pgp mediates lysosomal sequestration of chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer cells, thus contributing to drug resistance. Here, we describe that lysosomal sequestration of Pgp substrates, including doxorubicin, also occurs in human and porcine brain endothelial cells that form the blood-brain barrier. This is followed by shedding of drug-sequestering vesicular structures, which stay attached to the apical side of the plasma membrane and form aggregates ("barrier bodies") that ultimately undergo phagocytosis by neutrophils, thus constituting an as-yet-undescribed mechanism of drug disposal. These findings introduce a mechanism that might contribute to brain protection against potentially toxic xenobiotics, including therapeutically important chemotherapeutic drugs.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

Intestinal cholesterol absorption is a major determinant of plasma cholesterol level. The liver X receptor (LXR) is a nuclear receptor known for its activity in cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport. In this study, we uncovered a surprising function of LXR in intestinal cholesterol absorption and toxicity. Genetic or pharmacologic activation of LXR-sensitized mice to a high-cholesterol diet (HCD) induced intestinal toxicity and tissue damage, including the disruption of enterocyte , whereas the same HCD caused little toxicity in the absence of LXR activation. The gut toxicity in HCD-fed LXR-KI mice may have been accounted for by the increased intestinal cholesterol absorption and elevation of enterocyte and systemic levels of free cholesterol. The increased intestinal cholesterol absorption preceded the gut toxicity, suggesting that the increased absorption was not secondary to tissue damage. The heightened sensitivity to HCD in the HCD-fed LXR-activated mice appeared to be intestine-specific because the liver was not affected despite activation of the same receptor in this tissue. Moreover, heightened sensitivity to HCD cannot be reversed by ezetimibe, a Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 inhibitor that inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption, suggesting that the increased cholesterol absorption in LXR-activated intestine is mediated by a mechanism that has yet to be defined.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096822>N3ICD with the transmembrane domain can effectively inhibit EMT by correcting the position of /adherens .</a></h2><p>EMT allows a polarized epithelium to lose epithelial integrity and acquire mesenchymal characteristics. Previously, we found that overexpression of the intracellular domain of Notch3 (N3ICD) can inhibit EMT in breast cancer cells. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the influence of N3ICD or N3ICD combined with the transmembrane domain (TD+N3ICD) on the expression and distribution of TJs/AJs and polar molecules. We found that although N3ICD can upregulate the expression levels of the above-mentioned molecules, TD+N3ICD can inhibit EMT more effectively than N3ICD alone. TD+N3ICD overexpression upregulated the expression of endogenous full-length Notch3 and contributed to correcting the position of TJs/AJs molecules and better acinar structures formation. Co-immunoprecipitation results showed that the upregulated endogenous full-length Notch3 could physically interact with E-ca in MDA-MB-231/pCMV-(TD+N3ICD) cells.

Another important target of EPEC is the  (TJ), and EspF induces displacement of TJ proteins and increased intestinal permeability. Previously, we determined that an EPEC strain lacking EspF did not cause TJ disruption; meanwhile, pedestals were located on the TJ and smaller than those induced by the wild-type strain. Therefore, EspF could be playing an important role in both phenotypes. Here, using different cell models, we found that EspF was essential for pedestal maturation through ZO-1 disassembly from TJ, leading to (a) ZO-1 recruitment to the pedestal structure; no other main TJ proteins were required. Recruited ZO-1 allowed the afadin recruitment. () Afadin recruitment caused an afadin-ZO-1 transient interaction, like during TJ formation. (c) Afadin and ZO-1 were segregated to the tip and the stem of pedestal, respectively, causing pedestal maturation. Initiation of these three discrete phases for pedestal maturation functionally and physically required EspF expression.

We have identified protein kinase C-delta (PKCδ) as a critical regulator of the inflammatory response and demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of PKCδ by a peptide inhibitor (PKCδ-i) protected endothelial cells, decreased sepsis-mediated neutrophil influx into the lung, and prevented tissue damage. The objective of this study was to elucidate the regulation and relative contribution of PKCδ in the control of individual steps in neuroinflammation during sepsis.The role of PKCδ in mediating human brain microvascular endothelial (HBMVEC) permeability, junctional protein expression, and leukocyte adhesion and migration was investigated in vitro using our novel BBB on-a-chip (C) microfluidic assay and in vivo in a rat model of sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). HBMVEC were cultured under flow in the vascular channels of C. Confocal imaging and staining were used to confirm  and lumen formation. Confluent HBMVEC were pretreated with TNF-α (10 U/ml) for 4 h in the absence or presence of PKCδ-i (5 μM) to quantify neutrophil adhesion and migration in the C. Permeability was measured using a 40-kDa fluorescent dextran in vitro and Evans blue dye in vivo.During sepsis, PKCδ is activated in the rat brain resulting in membrane translocation, a step that is attenuated by treatment with PKCδ-i. Similarly, TNF-α-mediated activation of PKCδ and its translocation in HBMVEC are attenuated by PKCδ-i in vitro. PKCδ inhibition significantly reduced TNF-α-mediated hyperpermeability and TEER decrease in vitro in activated HBMVEC and rat brain in vivo 24 h after CLP induced sepsis. TNF-α-treated HBMVEC showed interrupted  expression, whereas continuous expression of  protein was observed in non-treated or PKCδ-i-treated cells. PKCδ inhibition also reduced TNF-α-mediated neutrophil adhesion and migration across HBMVEC in C. Interestingly, while PKCδ inhibition decreased the number of adherent neutrophils to baseline (no-treatment group), it significantly reduced the number of migrated neutrophils below the baseline, suggesting a critical role of PKCδ in regulating neutrophil transmigration.The BBB on-a-chip (C) in vitro assay is suitable for the study of BBB function as well as screening of novel therapeutics in real-time. PKCδ activation is a key signaling event that alters the structural and functional integrity of BBB leading to vascular damage and inflammation-induced tissue damage. PKCδ-TAT peptide inhibitor has therapeutic potential for the prevention or reduction of cerebrovascular injury in sepsis-induced vascular damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30675228>Effects of claudin-1 downregulation on the physiological processes of gallbladder cancer SGC996 cells.</a></h2><p>Gallbladder cancer has a high recurrence and mortality rate, with limited treatment options. Therefore, elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms of this disease would be beneficial to achieve an earlier diagnosis and potentially identify novel treatment targets. Claudin-1 is a  protein associated with the development and prognosis of several types of cancer, and our preliminary studies have demonstrated that claudin-1 expression is elevated in gallbladder cancer tissues. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of downregulating claudin-1 on the physiological processes of gallbladder cancer cells. The gallbladder cancer SGC996 cell line was transfected with claudin-1-RNA interference lentivirus (LV-CLDN1-RNAi) to downregulate claudin-1 expression, and the downstream effects on cell proliferation, the cell cycle, apoptosis and cell invasion were investigated. Following transfection with LV-CLDN1-RNAi, the results of an MTT assay revealed that downregulating claudin-1 did not affect the proliferation of the SGC996 cells. However, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that the number of cells arrested in the G phase increased significantly, whereas the amount of cells arrested in the S phase was significantly reduced. Annexin V-APC single-color staining demonstrated that downregulating claudin-1 expression increased the ratio of cell apoptosis, which was confirmed by the results of western blot analysis, in which levels of the pro-apoptotic -cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein were increased and decreased, respectively. Finally, a Transwell assay indicated that claudin-1 downregulation inhibited cell invasion. Overall, the results from the present study indicated that downregulating claudin-1 expression promoted the apoptosis of gallbladder cancer cells and inhibited cell invasion, indicating that claudin-1 may be involved in the recurrence and metastasis of gallbladder cancer. These insights provide theoretical and experimental foundations for considering claudin-1 as a novel target for the treatment of gallbladder cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30318192>Multifunctional quercetin conjugated chitosan nano-micelles with P-gp inhibition and permeation enhancement of anticancer drug.</a></h2><p>In this study, quercetin-chitosan conjugate (QT-CS) was synthesized for oral delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) to improve its oral bioavailability by increasing its water solubility, opening  and bypassing the P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The prepared QT-CS self-assembled into micelles which could encapsulate DOX with high encapsulation rate, small particle size (136.9 nm) and strong zeta potential (+16.2 mV). QT-CS-DOX micelles displayed sustained-release profile in gastrointestinal simulation fluid (pH 1.2/pH 7.4). QT-CS micelles could promote cellular uptake of doxorubicin, which was 2.2 folds higher than that of free doxorubicin. The trans epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) value of Caco-2 monolayer cells was significantly reduced (about 57%) by drug loaded QT-CS micelles, leading to a high apparent permeability coefficient (P) of doxorubicin, which was 10.17 folds higher than that of free doxorubicin. Above results indicate that QT-CS micelles are promising vehicles for the oral delivery of insoluble anticancer drugs.Copyright © 2018.

This study aims to elucidate the protection of erianin, a natural compound isolated from  Lindl, against DR development. Erianin alleviated BRB breakdown and rescued the reduced claudin1 and occludin expression in retinas from streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Erianin reduced microglial activation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, NF-κ transcriptional activation, and the elevated TNF-α expression both  and . ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 abrogated NF-κ activation in d-glucose-treated BV2 cells. Erianin reduced cellular glucose uptake, and molecular docking analysis indicated the potential interaction of erianin with glucose transporter (GLUT)1. GLUT1 inhibitor (STF31) reduced the activation of the ERK1/2-NF-κ signaling pathway. Coculture with d-glucose-stimulated microglial BV2 cells and with TNF-α stimulation both induced inner BRB and outer BRB damage in human retinal endothelial cells and APRE19 cells, but erianin improved all these damages. In summary, erianin attenuated BRB breakdown during DR development by inhibiting microglia-triggered retinal inflammation  reducing cellular glucose uptake and abrogating the subsequent activation of the downstream ERK1/2-NF-κ pathway. Moreover, erianin also alleviated BRB damage induced by TNF-α released from the activated microglia.-Zhang, T., Ouyang, H., Mei, X., Lu, ., Yu, Z., Chen, K., Wang, Z., Ji, L.

Therefore, we aimed to precisely define its role in macromolecule passage at single cell-cell . A combination of varying occludin expression by transient and stable knockdown including systematic seeding strategies was employed to achieve a broad and defined pattern of variance in occludin expression over epithelia. This variance model enabled us to examine occludin function in the leak pathway using global and local analysis, i.e. to analyze macromolecule flux across epithelia and macromolecule passage at single-cell level. Macromolecular flux was found not to correlate with occludin expression in intestinal epithelial cells. In fact, by spatially resolving macromolecular permeation sites using a recently developed method we uncovered leaky cell  at the edge of Transwells resulting in increased passage. This demonstrates that rare leaks can determine net flux of macromolecules across epithelia while the vast majority of cellular  do not contribute significantly. Hence, concomitant local analysis of macromolecule passage across epithelial barriers is indispensable for interpretation of global flux data. By combining this new approach with cell culture models of the leak pathway, we can present evidence that lack of occludin is not sufficient to stimulate the epithelial leak pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30571343>Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides dorei Reduce Gut Microbial Lipopolysaccharide Production and Inhibit Atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>It is increasingly recognized that gut microbiota play a pivotal role in the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Previously, we have reported that the abundance of genus Bacteroides is lower in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) than in patients without CAD with coronary risk factors or in healthy volunteers. However, it remains unclear which and how specific gut bacteria contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis.We recruited patients with CAD patients and controls without CAD with coronary risk factors. We then compared gut microbial composition using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing in fecal samples to detect species with differential abundance between 2 groups. Subsequently, we used atherosclerosis-prone mice to study the mechanisms underlying the relationship between such species and atherosclerosis.Human fecal 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing revealed a significantly lower abundance of Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides dorei in patients with CAD. This significant differential abundance was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Gavage with live . vulgatus and . dorei attenuated atherosclerotic lesion formation in atherosclerosis-prone mice, markedly ameliorating endotoxemia followed by decreasing gut microbial lipopolysaccharide production, effectively suppressing proinflammatory immune responses. Furthermore, fecal lipopolysaccharide levels in patients with CAD were significantly higher and negatively correlated with the abundance of . vulgatus and . dorei.Our translational research findings identify a previously unknown link between specific gut bacteria and atherosclerosis.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of EB on the barrier function in the intestinal porcine epithelial cells J2 (IPEC-J2). The IPEC-J2 cells were inoculated into 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 10 cells per well for 100% confluence. The cells were cultured in the presence of EB at concentrations of 0, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20 mg/ml for 48 hr. Then, 0.10 mg/ml was selected as the suitable concentration for the estimation of transepithelial electric resistance (TEER) value, alkaline phosphatase activity, proinflammatory cytokines mRNA expression,  mRNA and protein expression. The results of this study indicated that the supplementation of EB in IPEC-J2 cells decreased cellular membrane permeability and mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-γ (INF-γ), and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The supplementation of EB in IPEC-J2 cells increased  protein expression and anti-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). In addition, the western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results indicated that EB significantly (p < 0.05) increased the mRNA and protein expression of intestinal  proteins, Claudin-3, Occludin, and Zonula Occludins protein-1 (ZO-1).

However, studies concerning the effect of DON on fish intestine are scarce. This study explored the effects of DON on intestinal physical barrier in juvenile grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). A total of 1440 juvenile grass carp (12.17 ± 0.01 g) were fed six diets containing graded levels of DON (27, 318, 636, 922, 1243 and 1515 μg/kg diet) for 60 days. This study for the first time documented that DON caused body malformation in fish, and histopathological lesions, oxidative damage, declining antioxidant capacity, cell apoptosis and destruction of  in the intestine of fish. The results indicated that compared with control group (27 μg/kg diet), DON: (1) increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) content, and up-regulated the mRNA levels of Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1: Keap1a but not Keap1b), whereas decreased glutathione (GSH) content and antioxidant enzymes activities, and down-regulated the mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes (except GSTR in MI) and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), as well as the protein levels of Nrf2 in fish intestine. (2) up-regulated cysteinyl aspartic acid-protease (caspase) -3, -7, -8, -9, apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax), Fas ligand (FasL) and c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) mRNA levels, whereas down-regulated -cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2) and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) mRNA levels in fish intestine.

Colitis was induced by the addition of 2.5% (wt/vol) dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in the drinking water ad libitum for 7 days. The general condition, weight change, stool property, and bloody stool level of mice were observed to evaluate the disease activity index. The expression of zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin in intestinal tissue were measured by immunohistochemistry. The level of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-8 in plasma was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Inter-cellular  were observed by transmission electron microscopy.

Barley is a common concentrate ingredient; however, oat grain grows well in Ireland, is a source of lipids and fiber, and may provide an alternative to barley. The antioxidant α-tocopherol (α-TOC) plays a role in cell membrane structure, and it has the potential to improve  structures of the mammary gland that deteriorate in late lactation. The objective of this research was to investigate the effect of cereal type and α-TOC level on milk yield, milk composition, rumen fermentation, and N excretion in late-lactation dairy cows at pasture and when housed indoors on grass silage. Forty-eight Holstein Friesian dairy cows were blocked on days in milk (+185 d in milk) and balanced for parity, pre-experimental milk yield, milk composition, and body condition score and assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design (n = 12). The dietary treatments were control (C) base diet; base diet + barley-based concentrate + low α-TOC (350 IU/kg) (); base diet + oat-based concentrate + low α-TOC (350 IU/kg) (O); and base diet + oat-based concentrate + high α-TOC (1,050 IU/kg) (O+T). Following a 14-d acclimation period, diets were offered for a 49-d experimental period at pasture (P1) and a 21-d experimental period indoors (P2). The base diet was grazed grass in P1 and grass silage in P2. In P2, cows on C also received 2.65 kg (dry matter) of a standard concentrate. In P1, supplementation increased milk and milk solids yield (: 20.7 kg/d, 1.74 kg/d; O: 20.6 kg/d, 1.81 kg/d; O+T: 20.5 kg/d, 1.77 kg/d, respectively) compared with C (17.8 kg/d, 1.60 kg/d). Cows offered  had a lower milk fat (4.60%) concentration than C (5.00%) and O (4.90%). In P2, cereal type and α-TOC level did not alter milk production. In conclusion, concentrate supplementation increased milk and milk solids yield and cows offered O had a higher milk fat concentration than cows offered .

Since AgNPs may easily enter the brain through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), characterization of their interactions with cellular components of the neurovascular unit (NVU) is of particular importance. Therefore, in an animal model of prolonged low-dose exposure, we investigate the extent and mechanisms of influence of AgNPs on cerebral microvessels. Adult rats were treated orally with small (10 nm) AgNPs in a dose of 0.2 mg/kg .w. over a 2-week period. A silver citrate-exposed group was established as a positive control of ionic silver effects. Alterations in the expression of  proteins claudin-5, ZO-1, and occludin, were observed. These effects are accompanied by ultrastructural features indicating enhanced permeability of microvessels such as focal edema of perivascular astrocytic processes and surrounding neuropil. We did not identify changes in the expression of PDGFβR which is a marker of pericytes. Ultrastructural alterations in these cells were not identified.

However, it is known that ingredients in food can modulate the intestinal barrier, and have the potential to disrupt homeostasis of the gut. Here, we characterise a conditionally immortalised canine intestinal epithelial cell (cIEC) line for use in in vitro assays, to assess the effect of food ingredients on intestinal barrier function, permeability, cell health, and inflammation. Microscopy and flow cytometry confirmed that cIECs had a phenotype consistent with those of epithelial origin, and were able to differentiate to mature enterocytes. The cIECs also formed a monolayer when grown on Transwell® inserts, producing functional  between the cells. In contrast to the human-derived Caco-2 cell line, transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was increased in cIECs in response to two different raw ingredients. The exposure of cIECs to known inflammatory stimuli and raw ingredients induced the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated -cells (NF-?). This work demonstrates the value of a unique cIEC in vitro model to study the effects of food ingredients on canine intestinal function and health, and supports continued efforts to reduce and refine the use of animals in scientific research.2018 FRAME.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30410436>Cerebrovascular Pathology in Hypertriglyceridemic APOB-100 Transgenic Mice.</a></h2><p>Hypertriglyceridemia is not only a serious risk factor in the development of cardiovascular diseases, but it is linked to neurodegeneration, too. Previously, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing the human APOB-100 protein, a mouse model of human atherosclerosis. In this model we observed high plasma levels of triglycerides, oxidative stress, tau hyperphosphorylation, synaptic dysfunction, cognitive impairment, increased neural apoptosis and neurodegeneration. Neurovascular dysfunction is recognized as a key factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, but the cellular and molecular events linking cerebrovascular pathology and neurodegeneration are not fully understood. Our aim was to study cerebrovascular changes in APOB-100 transgenic mice. We described the kinetics of the development of chronic hypertriglyceridemia in the transgenic animals. Increased blood-brain barrier permeability was found in the hippocampus of APOB-100 transgenic mice which was accompanied by structural changes. Using transmission electron microscopy, we detected changes in the brain capillary endothelial  structure and edematous swelling of astrocyte endfeet. In brain microvessels isolated from APOB-100 transgenic animals increased , and decreased , and in transgenic brains reduced  and  gene expressions were measured using quantitative real-time PCR. We confirmed the decreased P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and vimentin expression related to the neurovascular unit by immunostaining in transgenic brain sections using confocal microscopy. We conclude that in chronic hypertriglyceridemic APOB-100 transgenic mice both functional and morphological cerebrovascular pathology can be observed, and this animal model could be a useful tool to study the link between cerebrovascular pathology and neurodegeneration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626868>Enhancement of the gut barrier integrity by a microbial metabolite through the Nrf2 pathway.</a></h2><p>The importance of gut microbiota in human health and pathophysiology is undisputable. Despite the abundance of metagenomics data, the functional dynamics of gut microbiota in human health and disease remain elusive. Urolithin A (UroA), a major microbial metabolite derived from polyphenolics of berries and pomegranate fruits displays anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-ageing activities. Here, we show that UroA and its potent synthetic analogue (UAS03) significantly enhance gut barrier function and inhibit unwarranted inflammation. We demonstrate that UroA and UAS03 exert their barrier functions through activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)- nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathways to upregulate epithelial  proteins. Importantly, treatment with these compounds attenuated colitis in pre-clinical models by remedying barrier dysfunction in addition to anti-inflammatory activities.

Recently, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has become an innovative alternative treatment target for epilepsy patients. KA causes neuronal injury and BBB damage in this experimental epilepsy model but the mechanisms underlying epilepsy-related neuronal injury, autophagy, and BBB damage remain unclear. Therefore, the present study investigated the relationships among neuronal injury, the expressions of autophagy-related proteins, and changes in BBB-related proteins during the acute phase of epilepsy to further understand the mechanisms and pharmacotherapy of epilepsy. NeuN immunohistochemistry and Fluoro-Jade  (FJ-) staining in the hippocampal CA3 region revealed that neuronal death induced by intraventricular injections of 10 μg/kg KA was greater than that induced by 3 μg/kg KA. In addition, there were transient increases in the levels of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3I/II) and Beclin-1, which are autophagy-related proteins involved in neuronal death, in this region 24 h after the administration of 10 μg/kg KA. There were also morphological changes in BBB-related cells such as astrocytes, endothelial cells (ECs), and  (TJs). More specifically, there was a significant increase in the activation of astrocytes 72 h after the administration of 10 μg/kg KA as well as continuous increases in the expressions of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and BBB-related TJ proteins (Zonula occludens-1 and Claudin-5) until 72 h after KA treatment. These results suggest that the overexpression of autophagy-related proteins and astrocytes and transient increases in the expressions of BBB-related TJ proteins may be closely related to autophagic neuronal injury. These findings provide a basis for the identification of novel therapeutic targets for patients with epilepsy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30932814>Low wnt/β-catenin signaling determines leaky vessels in the subfornical organ and affects water homeostasis in mice.</a></h2><p>The circumventricular organs (CVOs) in the central nervous system (CNS) lack a vascular blood-brain barrier (BBB), creating communication sites for sensory or secretory neurons, involved in body homeostasis. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential for BBB development and maintenance in endothelial cells (ECs) in most CNS vessels. Here we show that in mouse development, as well as in adult mouse and zebrafish, CVO ECs rendered Wnt-reporter negative, suggesting low level pathway activity. Characterization of the subfornical organ (SFO) vasculature revealed heterogenous claudin-5 (Cldn5) and Plvap/Meca32 expression indicative for  and leaky vessels, respectively. Dominant, EC-specific β-catenin transcription in mice, converted phenotypically leaky into BBB-like vessels, by augmenting Cldn5vessels, stabilizing  and by reducing Plvap/Meca32 and fenestrated vessels, resulting in decreased tracer permeability. Endothelial tightening augmented neuronal activity in the SFO of water restricted mice. Hence, regulating the SFO vessel barrier may influence neuronal function in the context of water homeostasis.© 2019, Benz et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554117>Evodiamine prevents dextran sulfate sodium-induced murine experimental colitis via the regulation of NF-κ and NLRP3 inflammasome.</a></h2><p>Evodiamine (EVO), an extraction from the traditional Chinese medicine Evodia rutaecarpa, has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and other pharmacological activities. However, the effectiveness of EVO to relieve dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) has not been evaluated. In this study, the protective effects and mechanisms of EVO on DSS-induced UC mice were investigated. The results indicated that treatment with EVO ameliorated DSS-induced UC mice body weight loss, disease activity index (DAI), colon length shortening, colonic pathological damage, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. The production of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 was also significantly inhibited by EVO. Further mechanistic results showed that EVO restrained the inflammation by regulating NF-κ signal and NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, results also showed that EVO contributed to the  (TJ) architecture integrity by modulating the expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin during colitis. Surprisingly, treatment with EVO reduced the concentration of plasmatic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and re-balanced the levels of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus. These findings suggested that EVO may have a potential protective effect on DSS-induced colitis and may be useful for the prevention and treatment of UC.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

A total of 120 1-d-old male broilers (Ross 308) were assigned to 4 treatment groups with 6 replicates of 5 birds per cage. The experiment was designed in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with LH (0 or 120 mg/kg) and LPS (injection of saline or 1.5 mg/kg body weight) as treatments. On days 14, 16, 18, and 20 of the trial, broilers were intraperitoneally injected with LPS or physiological saline. Compared with the control group, LPS-challenged broilers showed impaired growth performance (P < 0.05) from day 15 to day 21 of the trial, increased serum diamine oxidase (DAO) and D-lactic acid (D-LA) levels coupled with reduced glutathione (GSH) content and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity (duodenal and jejunal mucosa), reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content (duodenal, jejunal, and ileal mucosa), and compromised morphological structure of the duodenum and jejunum. Additionally, LPS challenge increased (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes and reduced  (TJ) protein expression in the jejunum. However, dietary LH prevented LPS-induced reductions in average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) in broilers. It also alleviated LPS challenge-induced increases in serum DAO levels, MDA content (duodenal and jejunal mucosa), and jejunal crypt depth (P < 0.05) but reduced villus height, GSH content (jejunal mucosa), and T-SOD activity (duodenal and jejunal mucosa) (P < 0.05). Additionally, LH supplementation significantly downregulated the mRNA expression of nuclear factor (NF)-κ, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and upregulated the mRNA expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and Occludin in the jejunal mucosa induced by LPS (P < 0.05). On the other hand, LH administration prevented LPS-induced activation of the p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and attenuated IkB alpha (Iκα) phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κ (p65) in the jejunal mucosa. In conclusion, dietary LH supplementation attenuates intestinal mucosal disruption mainly by accelerating the expression of TJ proteins and inhibiting activation of the NF-κ/MAPK signaling pathway.© The Author(s) 2019.

There are evidences that low concentrations of aspirin can effectively prevent cardiovascular diseases. We hypothesized that low-dose aspirin could ameliorate endothelial injury by inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and ultimately prevent cardiovascular diseases. Microvascular endothelial cells were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (2 μg/mL) and administrated by 0.1-2 mmol/L aspirin. The wild type mice were stimulated with LPS (100 μg/kg/day), and 1 h later treated with aspirin (12.5, 62.5, or 125 mg/kg/day) and dexamethasone (0.0182 mg/kg/day) for 7 days. Plasma and heart were harvested for measurement of ELISA and immunofluorescence analyses. We found that aspirin could inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation  in dose-dependent manner and has correlation between the NLRP3 inflammasome and the ROS/TXNIP pathway. We also found that low-concentration aspirin could inhibit the formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and restore the expression of the endothelial  protein zonula occludens-1/2 (ZO1/2). We assume that aspirin can ameliorate the endothelial layer dysfunction by suppressing the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30610879>Vanillin protects the blood-milk barrier and inhibits the inflammatory response in LPS-induced mastitis in mice.</a></h2><p>Vanillin is used in a variety of food, chemical, and pharmaceutical applications, and exhibits anti-inflammatory properties. However, there are no reports about the effects of vanillin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mastitis. In this study, we explored the effects of vanillin on the subsequent inflammatory response and blood-milk barrier in LPS-induced mastitis. Results showed that vanillin suppressed the inflammatory response by a) inhibiting myeloperoxidase activity; ) decreasing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators which include tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf-α; from 128.5 ± 14.59 to 67.51 ± 10.88,pg/mL, P < 0.01), interleukin-6 (Il-6; from 531.5 ± 196.4 to 109.3 ± 24.14, pg/mL, P < 0.05), interleukin-1β (Il-1β; from 2569 ± 1648 to 731.8 ± 171.7, pg/mL, P < 0.05), inducible nitric oxide synthase (Inos), and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2); and c) repairing the blood-milk barrier by increasing the protein levels of the  proteins, including zona occludens 1 (Zo-1), claudin-3, and occludin. In vitro experiment, Vanillin can inhibit LPS-induced inflammation and enhance the protein levels of  proteins. Further studies have shown that vanillin inhibits inflammation by inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells (NF-κ) signaling pathways. Our findings showed that vanillin protects mammary gland from LPS-induced mastitis by enhancing the blood-milk barrier and inhibiting the inflammatory response.Copyright © 2018.

To identify the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with these effects, we simultaneously profiled micro-RNA (miRNA) and mRNA expression in the colon of chronically simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaques administered either vehicle (VEH/SIV;  = 9) or Δ-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ-THC; THC/SIV;  = 8). Pro-inflammatory miR-130a, miR-222, and miR-29b, lipopolysaccharide-responsive miR-146b-5p and SIV-induced miR-190b were significantly upregulated in VEH/SIV rhesus macaques. Compared to VEH/SIV rhesus macaques, 10 miRNAs were significantly upregulated in THC/SIV rhesus macaques, among which miR-204 was confirmed to directly target MMP8, an extracellular matrix-degrading collagenase that was significantly downregulated in THC/SIV rhesus macaques. Moreover, THC/SIV rhesus macaques failed to upregulate pro-inflammatory miR-21, miR-141 and miR-222, and alpha/beta-defensins, suggesting attenuated intestinal inflammation. Further, THC/SIV rhesus macaques showed higher expression of  proteins (occludin, claudin-3), anti-inflammatory , keratin-8 (stress protection),  (epithelial proliferation), and anti-HIV . Gomori one-step trichrome staining detected significant collagen deposition (fibrosis) in the paracortex and  cell follicular zones of axillary lymph nodes from all VEH/SIV but not in THC/SIV rhesus macaques, thus demonstrating the ability of Δ-THC to prevent lymph node fibrosis, a serious irreversible consequence of HIV induced chronic inflammation. Furthermore, using flow cytometry, we showed that Δ-THC suppressed intestinal T cell proliferation/activation (Ki67/HLA-DR) and PD-1 expression and increased the percentages of anti-inflammatory CD163 macrophages. Finally, while Δ-THC did not affect the levels of CD4 T cells, it significantly reduced absolute CD8 T cell numbers in peripheral blood at 14 and 150 days post-SIV infection. These translational findings strongly support a role for differential miRNA/gene induction and T cell activation in Δ-THC-mediated suppression of intestinal inflammation in HIV/SIV and potentially other chronic inflammatory diseases of the intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30053064>Syndecan-4 Modulates Epithelial Gut Barrier Function and Epithelial Regeneration in Experimental Colitis.</a></h2><p>The transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan Syndecan-4 (Sdc4) plays an important role in the regulation of various inflammatory disorders. However, the involvement of Sdc4 in intestinal inflammation remains unknown. Therefore, we assessed the impact of Sdc4 deficiency on experimental colitis and epithelial wound healing in vitro and in vivo.Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis was monitored in wild type and Sdc4-deficient (Sdc4-/-) mice by assessment of body weight, histology, inflammatory cellular infiltration, and colon length. Syndecan-4 expression was measured by immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and quantitative real-time PCR. Epithelial permeability was evaluated by Evans blue measurements, Western blot, and immunohistological analysis of  protein expression. Impact of Sdc4 on epithelial wound healing was determined by scratch assay in vitro and by colonoscopy following mechanical wounding in vivo.In Sdc4-/- mice, colitis-like symptoms including severe weight loss, shortened colon length, histological damage, and invasion of macrophages and granulocytes were markedly aggravated compared with wild type (WT) animals. Moreover, colonic epithelial permeability in Sdc4-/- mice was enhanced, while  protein expression decreased. Furthermore, Sdc4-/- colonic epithelial cells had lower cell proliferation and migration rates which presented in vivo as a prolonged intestinal wound healing phenotype. Strikingly, in WT animals, Sdc4 expression was reduced during colitis and was elevated during recovery.The loss of Sdc4 aggravates the course of experimental colitis, potentially through impaired epithelial cell integrity and regeneration. In view of the development of current treatment approaches involving Sdc4 inhibition for inflammatory disorders like arthritis, particular caution should be taken in case of adverse gastrointestinal side-effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666520>Myosin IIA Regulated  in Oxygen Glucose-Deprived Brain Endothelial Cells Via Activation of TLR4/PI3K/Akt/JNK1/2/14-3-3ε/NF-κ/MMP9 Signal Transduction Pathway.</a></h2><p>Non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMMHC IIA), a member of Myosin II family, plays a critical role in various cellular physiological processes.

Thus, in the current study, we attempted to uncover the regulation pattern of NMMHC IIA on  dysfunction in oxygen glucose-deprived (OGD) mouse brain bEND.3 endothelial cells. The regulation of NMMHC IIA on  in OGD-stimulated bEND.3 cells was evaluated by western blotting assay. Morphologic change of occludin, claudin-5, and ZO-1  proteins was compared with pretreatment with NMMHC II inhibitor blebbistatin via immunohistochemical staining. Detection of activation of NMMHC IIA on OGD-mediated  transduction pathway was investigated via Koch's postulate using corresponding protein inhibitor. Our results showed that NMMHC IIA was activated in OGD-stimulated bEND.3 endothelial cells. The inhibition of NMMHC IIA could attenuate the morphologic change of occludin, claudin-5, and ZO-1  proteins. NMMHC IIA participated in regulating downstream transduction pathway TLR4, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, JNK1/2, 14-3-3ε, nuclear factor kappa  (NF-к) and matrix metalloprotein 9 (MMP9). Blocking of these pathways using indicated inhibitors demonstrated that NMMHC IIA destroyed the connection of  via the activation of TLR4/PI3K/Akt/JNK1/2/14-3-3ε/NF-κ/MMP9 pathway.

However, the effects of it on the interaction between intestinal flora and organisms and how it influences immune responses remain unresolved.To investigate the role of UCB in intestinal barrier function and immune inflammation in mice with dextran-sulfate-sodium-induced colitis.Acute colitis was induced by 3% (/) dextran sulfate sodium salt in drinking water for 6 d followed by untreated water for 2 d. Concurrently, mice with colitis were administered 0.2 mL UCB (400 μmol/L) by intra-gastric gavage for 7 d. Disease activity index (DAI) was monitored daily. Mice were sacrificed at the end of the experiment. The length of the colon and weight of the spleen were recorded. Serum level of D-lactate, intestinal digestive proteases activity, and changes to the gut flora were analyzed. In addition, colonic specimens were analyzed by histology and for expression of inflammatory markers and proteins.Mice treated with UCB had significantly relieved severity of colitis, including lower DAI, longer colon length, and lower spleen weight (colon length: 4.92 ± 0.09 cm  3.9 ± 0.15 cm; spleen weight: 0.33 ± 0.04  0.74 ± 0.04,  < 0.001).

Here, we investigate the PF potential anti-inflammatory effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human Caco-2 cell monolayers and explore its underlying key molecular mechanism. In this context, PF significantly increased TEER value, decreased intestinal epithelium FITC-dextran flux permeability, and restored the expressions of occludin, ZO-1, and claudin5 in LPS-induced Caco-2 cell. In vitro, treatment of PF significantly inhibited LPS-induced expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). In addition, we found that PF suppressed nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) signaling via activating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways in ILPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells.

In most types of stroke, the BBB is markedly compromised, potentially leading to a cascade of injury processes and functional deficits, so we examined a number of biomarkers associated with BBB disruption to determine whether VDH deficiency would further compromise the BBB following a stroke. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of two diet cohorts, VDH-sufficient (VDH) and VDH. The VDH group was fed standard rat chow and the VDH group got a VDH-null version of the same diet for 8 weeks. Animals from both cohorts were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) surgery, killed at 72 h post-stroke, and their brains evaluated for BBB permeability and injury severity using expression of immunoglobulin (IgG), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity and alteration of  (TJ) proteins as markers of BBB disruption. We also evaluated modulation of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1), osteopontin (OPN), β-catenin and vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression in VDH and VDH subjects. At the time of MCAO, rats on the VDH diet had circulating VDH levels one-fourth that of rats fed control chow. IgG extravasation after MCAO, indicating more severe BBB injury, was significantly higher in the MCAO+VDH than the MCAO+VDH rats. Following MCAO, expression of MMP-9, GLUT1, VDR and OPN increased and the TJ proteins occludin and claudin-5 decreased significantly in the VDH compared to the VDH group. We also observed significantly lower expression of β-catenin in the MCAO group of both VDH and VDH rats. Under these conditions, VDH deficiency itself can compromise the BBB. We think that low serum VDH levels are likely to complicate stroke severity and its chronic consequences.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, whether UDCA has improving effects on diabetic retinopathy (DR) is not known. This study aims to observe the amelioration of UDCA on DR and its engaged mechanisms. The results of Evans blue permeation assay showed that UDCA (15, 30 mg/kg) reversed the breakdown of blood-retinal barrier (BRB) and the decreased expression of claudin-1 and claudin-19 in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reversed the reduced thickness of both inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reduced retinal ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) expression in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reduced the expression of phosphorylated the inhibitor of nuclear factor κ kinase (IKK) and the nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of nuclear factor κ (NFκ) in retinas from STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA also reduced retinal expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in STZ-induced diabetic mice.

Significant expression of mRNAs encoding CLIC1, 2, 4, and 5 were found in the human tissues, but only CLIC2 was predominantly expressed in non-cancer tissues surrounding cancer masses. Fibrotic or dysfunctional (aspartate aminotransferase ≥40) non-cancer liver tissues and advanced stage HCC tissues expressed low levels of CLIC2. Endothelial cells lining blood vessels but not lymphatic vessels in non-cancer tissues expressed CLIC2 as well as high levels of the  proteins claudins 1 and 5, occludin, and ZO-1. Most endothelial cells in blood vessels in cancer tissues had very low expressions of CLIC2 and  proteins. CD31/CD45 endothelial cells isolated from non-cancer tissues expressed mRNAs encoding CLIC2, claudin 1, occludin and ZO-1, while similar cell fractions from cancer tissues had very low expressions of these molecules. Knockdown of CLIC2 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) allowed human cancer cells to transmigrate through a HUVEC monolayer. These results suggest that CLIC2 may be involved in the formation and/or maintenance of  and that cancer tissue vasculature lacks CLIC2 and , which allows the intravasation of cancer cells necessary for hematogenous metastasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31099453>Dysregulation of focal adhesion kinase upon Toxoplasma gondii infection facilitates parasite translocation across polarised primary brain endothelial cell monolayers.</a></h2><p>The apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii invades tissues and traverses non-permissive biological barriers in infected humans and other vertebrates. Following ingestion, the parasite penetrates the intestinal wall and disseminates to immune-privileged sites such as the brain parenchyma, after crossing the blood-brain barrier. In the present study, we have established a protocol for high-purification of primary mouse brain endothelial cells to generate stably polarised monolayers that allowed assessment of cellular barrier traversal by T. gondii. We report that T. gondii tachyzoites translocate across polarised monolayers of mouse brain endothelial cells and human intestinal Caco2 cells without significantly perturbing barrier impermeability and with minimal change in transcellular electrical resistance. In contrast, challenge with parasite lysate or LPS increased barrier permeability by destabilising intercellular  (TJs) and accentuated transmigration of T. gondii. Conversely, reduced phosphorylation of the TJ-regulator focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was observed dose-dependently upon challenge of monolayers with live T. gondii but not with parasite lysate or LPS. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK phosphorylation reversibly altered barrier integrity and facilitated T. gondii translocation. Finally, gene silencing of FAK by shRNA facilitated transmigration of T. gondii across epithelial and endothelial monolayers. Jointly, the data demonstrate that T. gondii infection transiently alters the TJ stability through FAK dysregulation to facilitate transmigration. This work identifies the implication of the TJ regulator FAK in the transmigration of T. gondii across polarised cellular monolayers and provides novel insights in how microbes overcome the restrictiveness of biological barriers.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182728>Progesterone decreases gut permeability through upregulating occludin expression in primary human gut tissues and Caco-2 cells.</a></h2><p>Progesterone plays a protective role in preventing inflammation and preterm delivery during pregnancy. However, the mechanism involved is unknown. Microbial product translocation from a permeable mucosa is demonstrated as a driver of inflammation. To study the mechanism of the protective role of progesterone during pregnancy, we investigated the effect of physiologic concentrations of progesterone on  protein occludin expression and human gut permeability in vitro and systemic microbial translocation in pregnant women in vivo. Plasma bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a representative marker of in vivo systemic microbial translocation was measured. We found that plasma LPS levels were significantly decreased during 24 to 28 weeks of gestation compared to 8 to 12 weeks of gestation. Moreover, plasma LPS levels were negatively correlated with plasma progesterone levels but positively correlated with plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels at 8 to 12 weeks of gestation but not at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation. Progesterone treatment increased intestinal trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in primary human colon tissues and Caco-2 cells in vitro through upregulating  protein occludin expression. Furthermore, progesterone exhibited an inhibitory effect on nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) activation following LPS stimulation in Caco-2 cells. These results reveal a novel mechanism that progesterone may play an important role in decreasing mucosal permeability, systemic microbial translocation, and inflammation during pregnancy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30616205>Development and characterization of swine primary respiratory epithelial cells and their susceptibility to infection by four influenza virus types.</a></h2><p>Influenza viruses are a group of respiratory pathogens that have evolved into four different types: A, , C, and D. A common feature is that all four types are capable of replicating and transmitting among pigs. Here, we describe the development of isogenous cell culture system from the swine respiratory tract to study influenza viruses. Phenotypic characterization of swine primary nasal turbinate, trachea and lung cells revealed high expression of cytokeratin and demonstrated tissue site dependent expression of  proteins. Furthermore, lectin binding assay on these cells demonstrated higher levels of Sia2-6Gal than Sia2-3Gal receptors and supported the replication of influenza A, , C, and D viruses to appreciable levels at both 33 and 37 °C, but replication competence was dependent on virus type or temperature used. Overall, these swine primary respiratory cells showed epithelial phenotype, which is suitable for studying the comparative biology and pathobiology of influenza viruses.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Various preventive and adjuvant therapies based on modulating the gut flora have been proposed for hepatic injury. We aimed to explore the preventive and therapeutic effects of Bifidobacterium adolescentis CGMCC15058 on rat liver failure, as well as the potential microecological and immunological mechanisms of those effects. . adolescentis CGMCC15058 (3 × 10 CFU), isolated from healthy human stool, was gavaged to Sprague-Dawley rats for 14 days. Acute liver injury was induced on the 15th day by intraperitoneal injection of D-galactosamine. After 24 h, liver and terminal ileum histology, liver function, plasma cytokines, bacterial translocation and gut microbiota composition were assessed. We found that pretreatment with . adolescentis significantly relieved elevated serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bile acid and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and enhanced the expression of mucin 4 and the  protein zonula occludens-1. . adolescentis exhibited anti-inflammatory properties as indicated by decreased levels of mTOR and the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, as well as elevated levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukins-10 in the liver. Similar anti-inflammatory signs were also found in plasma. . adolescentis significantly altered the microbial community, depleting the common pathogenic taxon Proteus and markedly enriching the taxa Coriobacteriaceae, Bacteroidales and Allobaculum, which are involved in regulating the metabolism of lipids and aromatic amino acids. Our findings not only suggest . adolescentis acts as a prospective probiotic against liver failure but also provide new insights into the prevention and treatment of liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946611> inhibits oncostatin M and maintains  integrity in a murine model of acute experimental colitis.</a></h2><p> Levels of oncostatin M (OSM) and the composition of gut microbiota predict responses to anti-TNF agents used for IBD therapy. Here, the aim was to investigate the effects of , a gut microbiota, on OSM and on intestinal barrier in colitis.  In the murine model of 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, we tested disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histological score and expression of  (TJ) proteins (ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1), OSM, TNF-α and TLR5. In addition, a cellular model was used to examine the role of  during secretion of OSM by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) isolated from wild-type (WT) and TLR5 knockout (TLR5 KO) mice. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of OSM on expressions of TJ proteins by Caco-2 cells.   in DSS-induced colitis decreased DAI score ( < .001), colon length shortening (6.46 ± 0.36 cm  5.65 ± 0.47 cm,  = .022), histological score (2.667 ± 1.15  5.33 ± 1.14,  = .018) and increased expression of TJ proteins ( < .05). In addition,  reduced expression of OSM ( < .05) and TNF-α ( < .05), while increasing expression of TLR5 ( < .05). Furthermore,  reduced secretion of OSM ( < .05) by LPS-induced BMDMs isolated from WT and TLR5 KO mice. Moreover, OSM downregulated expression of TJ proteins ( < .05) by Caco-2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner.  These results indicate that  attenuates inflammation in IBD by decreasing secretion of OSM and by promoting intestinal barrier function. Taken together, the data provide insight into the role of the gut microbiota in patients with IBD who are resistant to anti-TNF therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30688264> injection protects cerebral microvascular endothelial cells against oxygen-glucose deprivation reperfusion.</a></h2><p>Shuxuetong injection composed of leech (Hirudo nipponica Whitman) and earthworm (Pheretima aspergillum) has been used for the clinical treatment of acute stroke for many years in China. However, the precise neuroprotective mechanism of Shuxuetong injection remains poorly understood. Here, cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (bEnd.3) were incubated in glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 95% N/5% CO for 6 hours, followed by high-glucose medium containing 95% O and 5% CO for 18 hours to establish an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion model. This in vitro cell model was administered Shuxuetong injection at 1/32, 1/64, and 1/128 concentrations (diluted 32-, 64-, and 128-times). Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to evaluate cell viability. A fluorescence method was used to measure lactate dehydrogenase, and a fluorescence microplate reader used to detect intracellular reactive oxygen species. A fluorescent probe was also used to measure mitochondrial superoxide production. A cell resistance meter was used to measure transepithelial resistance and examine integrity of monolayer cells. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran test was performed to examine blood-brain barrier permeability. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed to analyze mRNA expression levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Western blot assay was performed to analyze expression of caspase-3, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, occludin, vascular endothelial growth factor, cleaved caspase-3, -cell lymphoma 2, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, nuclear factor-κ p65, I kappa  alpha, phosphorylated I kappa  alpha, I kappa  kinase, phosphorylated I kappa  kinase, claudin-5, and zonula occludens-1. Our results show that Shuxuetong injection increases bEnd.3 cell viability and -cell lymphoma 2 expression, reduces cleaved caspase-3 expression, inhibits production of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial superoxide, suppresses expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, markedly increases transepithelial resistance, decreases blood-brain barrier permeability, upregulates claudin-5, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 expression, reduces nuclear factor-κ p65 and vascular endothelial growth factor expression, and reduces I kappa  alpha, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2, and I kappa  kinase phosphorylation levels. Overall, these findings suggest that Shuxuetong injection has protective effects on brain microvascular endothelial cells after oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion. Moreover, its protective effect is associated with reduction of mitochondrial superoxide production, inhibition of the inflammatory response, and inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2, and the nuclear factor-κ p65 signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31434568>Current understanding of the gut microbiota shaping mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidences have shown strong associations between gut microbiota and many human diseases, and understanding the dynamic crosstalks of host-microbe interaction in the gut has become necessary for the detection, prevention, or therapy of diseases. Many reports have showed that diet, nutrient, pharmacologic factors and many other stimuli play dominant roles in the modulation of gut microbial compositions. However, it is inappropriate to neglect the impact of host factors on shaping the gut microbiota. In this review, we highlighted the current findings of the host factors that could modulate the gut microbiota. Particularly the epithelium-associated factors, including the innate immune sensors, anti-microbial peptides, mucus barrier, secretory IgAs, epithelial microvilli, epithelial , epithelium metabolism, oxygen barrier, and even the microRNAs are discussed in the context of the microbiota shaping. With these shaping factors, the gut epithelial cells could select the residing microbes and affect the microbial composition. This knowledge not only could provide the opportunities to better control many diseases, but may also be used for predicting the success of fecal microbiota transplantation clinically.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31004933>APOC3 promotes TNF-α-induced expression of JAM-1 in endothelial cell via PI3K-IKK2-p65 pathway.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease with lipid accumulation. Apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3), which is an important regulator of human lipid metabolism, is associated with multiple vascular mechanisms in atherosclerosis and proinflammatory responses. We have previously reported that the expression of inflammatory cytokine TNF-α is elevated in human endothelial cells (HUVECs) after APOC3 treatment. This study investigates the APOC3 signaling pathway involved in TNF-α-mediated expression of JAM-1 in HUVECs. Cultured HUVECs were exposed to APOC3 (50 μg/ml) for 16 h. Mechanistic studies were carried out by silencing TNF-α gene with lentiviral TNF-α-shRNA. Our study was based on the eight signaling pathway inhibitors to block the effect of APOC3 in HUVECs. The expression of JAM-1 was determined by qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and flow cytometry. IKK2 degradation and NF-κ p65 phosphorylation were determined by Western blotting. Our results showed that APOC3 significantly promoted the TNF-α-induced expression of JAM-1 in HUVECs. Inhibiting APOC3 reversed the TNF-α-induced overexpression of JAM-1. Moreover, APOC3 induced the expression of NF-κ p65 and degraded Iκ. In conclusion, APOC3 promoted the expression of JAM-1 via the NF-κ, IKK2, and PI3K signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we studied the potential role of CXCL5/CXCL8 receptor 2 (CXCR2) as a regulator of paraendothelial brain barrier function, using the well-characterized human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3. Low basal CXCR2 mRNA and protein expression levels in hCMEC/D3 were found to strongly increase under inflammatory conditions. Correspondingly, immunohistochemistry of brain biopsies from two patients with active multiple sclerosis revealed upregulation of endothelial CXCR2 compared to healthy control tissue. Recombinant CXCL5 or CXCL8 rapidly and transiently activated Akt/protein kinase  in hCMEC/D3. This was followed by a redistribution of -associated protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and by the formation of actin stress fibers. Functionally, these morphological changes corresponded to a decrease of paracellular barrier function, as measured by a real-time electrical impedance-sensing system. Importantly, preincubation with the selective CXCR2 antagonist SB332235 partially prevented chemokine-induced disturbance of both  morphology and function. We conclude that human brain endothelial CXCR2 may contribute to blood-brain barrier disturbance under inflammatory conditions with increased CXCL5 and CXCL8 expression, where CXCR2 may also represent a novel pharmacological target for blood-brain barrier stabilization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30010460>A membrane fusion protein, Ykt6, regulates epithelial cell migration via microRNA-mediated suppression of Junctional Adhesion Molecule A.</a></h2><p>Vesicle trafficking regulates epithelial cell migration by remodeling matrix adhesions and delivering signaling molecules to the migrating leading edge. Membrane fusion, which is driven by soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor associated receptor (SNARE) proteins, is an essential step of vesicle trafficking. Mammalian SNAREs represent a large group of proteins, but few have been implicated in the regulation of cell migration. Ykt6 is a unique SNARE existing in equilibrium between active membrane-bound and inactive cytoplasmic pools, and mediating vesicle trafficking between different intracellular compartments. The biological functions of this protein remain poorly understood. In the present study, we found that Ykt6 acts as a negative regulator of migration and invasion of human prostate epithelial cells. Furthermore, Ykt6 regulates the integrity of epithelial adherens and . The observed anti-migratory activity of Ykt6 is mediated by a unique mechanism involving the expressional upregulation of microRNA 145, which selectively decreases the cellular level of Junctional Adhesion Molecule (JAM) A. This decreased JAM-A expression limits the activity of Rap1 and Rac1 small GTPases, thereby attenuating cell spreading and motility. The described novel functions of Ykt6 could be essential for the regulation of epithelial barriers, epithelial repair, and metastatic dissemination of cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29913106>GPR40 receptor activation promotes  assembly in airway epithelial cells via AMPK-dependent mechanisms.</a></h2><p> play key roles in the regulation of airway epithelial barrier function and promotion of  integrity is beneficial to lung health. G-protein coupled receptor (GPR) 40 has been identified as a receptor of polyunsaturated fatty acids. This study aimed to investigate the function of GPR40 in regulating  assembly in human airway epithelial cells (Calu-3 cells) using GW9508, a GPR40 agonist. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analyses showed that Calu-3 cells expressed both types of polyunsaturated fatty acid receptors including GPR40 and GPR120. Intracellular Ca measurements confirmed that GW9508 stimulated GPR40, but not GPR120. In Ca switch assays, GW9508 promoted the recovery of transepithelial electrical resistance and re-localization of zonula occludens (ZO)-1 to intercellular areas. These effects were suppressed by inhibitors of GPR40 and phospholipase C (PLC). Interestingly, GW9508 enhanced  assembly in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner. The effect of GW9508 on inducing  assembly was also confirmed in 16HBE14o- cells. Our results indicate that GPR40 stimulation by GW9508 leads to AMPK activation via calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ). Collectively, this study reveals an unprecedented role of GPR40 in facilitating airway epithelial  assembly via PLC-CaMKKβ-AMPK pathways. GPR40 represents a novel regulator of airway epithelial integrity and its stimulation may be beneficial in the treatment of airway diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31290318>Binary Self-Assembly of Conjugated Block Copolymers and Quantum Dots at the Air-Liquid Interface into Ordered Functional Nanoarrays.</a></h2><p>Controlling the nanoscale morphology of conducting polymer/nanoparticle hybrid films is a highly desired but challenging task. Here, we report that such functional hybrid films with unprecedented structural order can be formed through the self-assembly of conjugated block copolymers and CdSe quantum dots at the air-water interface. The one-step assembly of quantum dots and block copolymers composed of polythiophene and polyethylene glycol (P3HT--PEG) at the fluidic interface generated a highly ordered assembly structure of P3HT nanowires and one-dimensional quantum dot arrays. Structure analyses revealed a unique self-assembly behavior and size dependency, which are distinct from the conventional self-assembly of coil-type polymers on solid substrates. Interestingly, hydrophobic quantum dots reside at the interface between P3HT and PEG domains without disrupting the P3HT packing structure, which is advantageous for the optoelectronic properties. Furthermore, large particles bridge the P3HT nanowires at both ends, while small particles decorate each P3HT/PEG interfaces, thus forming  p-n  for a broad size range of nanoparticles. The nanoparticle-incorporated hybrid films showed more than an order of magnitude higher photocurrent and light sensitivity compared to polymer-only films, consistent with the assembly structure with close contact between the organic and inorganic semiconductors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30345803>Small intestine barrier function failure induces systemic inflammation in monosodium glutamate-induced chronically obese mice.</a></h2><p>Chronic obesity has increased worldwide, in conjunction with type 2 diabetes. Chronic obesity causes systemic inflammation that may result in functional deterioration of the gastrointestinal barrier. However, gastrointestinal conditions associated with chronic obesity have not been comprehensively investigated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate morphological changes in small intestine barrier structures during chronic obesity. A mouse model of chronic obesity induced by monosodium glutamate treatment was established. At postnatal week 15, pathological changes including in small intestinal epithelial cells were analyzed in chronically obese mice compared with controls. Numerous gaps were identified between small intestinal epithelial cells in chronically obese mice, and levels of both desmosomal and  proteins were significantly lower in their small intestinal epithelial cells. Moreover, in chronically obese mice, a significant increase in the number of intestinal inflammatory cells, particularly macrophages, was observed; in addition, blood samples from the mouse model show an increase in markers of inflammation, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1-beta. These findings suggest that functional deterioration of adhesion structures between small intestinal epithelial cells causes gastrointestinal barrier function failure, leading to a rise in intestinal permeability to blood vessels and consequent systemic inflammation, characterized by macrophage infiltration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646033>Transdermal fluorescence detection of a dual fluorophore system for noninvasive point-of-care gastrointestinal permeability measurement.</a></h2><p>The intestinal mucosal barrier prevents macromolecules and pathogens from entering the circulatory stream.  in this barrier are compromised in inflammatory bowel diseases, environmental enteropathy, and enteric dysfunction.

However, the precise mechanisms underlying the immunoregulatory and antiviral activities of immunobiotics have not yet been elucidated in detail. The present study was conducted to determine whether selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) modulate toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C) induced viral response in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). PolyI:C increased the expression of interferon-β (IFN-β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in HCT116 cells, and these up-regulations were significantly altered when cells were pre-stimulated with LAB isolated from Korean fermented foods. LAB strains were capable to up-regulate IFN-β but down-regulated IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and IL-1β mRNA levels as compared with PolyI: C. HCT-116 cell treatment with LABs beneficially modulated the mRNA levels of C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL-10), 2-5A oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OSA1), myxovirus resistance protein (MxA), TLR3, and retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), and TLR negative regulators. In addition, LABs increased IFN-β, IFN-α, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) and decreased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-1β protein/mRNA levels in THP-1 cells. LABs also protected the cells by maintaining  proteins (zonula occludens-1 and occludin). The beneficial effects of these LABs were mediated via modulation of the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ) pathways. Overall, the results of this study indicate that immunobiotics have potent antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities that may use as antiviral substitutes for human and animal applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30582445>PATJ Low Frequency Variants Are Associated With Worse Ischemic Stroke Functional Outcome.</a></h2><p>Ischemic stroke is among the leading causes of adult disability. Part of the variability in functional outcome after stroke has been attributed to genetic factors but no locus has been consistently associated with stroke outcome.Our aim was to identify genetic loci influencing the recovery process using accurate phenotyping to produce the largest GWAS (genome-wide association study) in ischemic stroke recovery to date.A 12-cohort, 2-phase (discovery-replication and joint) meta-analysis of GWAS included anterior-territory and previously independent ischemic stroke cases. Functional outcome was recorded using 3-month modified Rankin Scale. Analyses were adjusted for confounders such as discharge National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. A gene-based burden test was performed. The discovery phase (n=1225) was followed by open (n=2482) and stringent joint-analyses (n=1791). Those cohorts with modified Rankin Scale recorded at time points other than 3-month or incomplete data on previous functional status were excluded in the stringent analyses. Novel variants in PATJ (Pals1-associated ) gene were associated with worse functional outcome at 3-month after stroke. The top variant was rs76221407 (G allele, β=0.40, P=1.70×10).Our results identify a set of common variants in PATJ gene associated with 3-month functional outcome at genome-wide significance level.

The intestinal barrier is tasked with preventing intestinal pathogenic bacteria and toxins from reaching the parenteral tissues through the intestinal wall. Therefore, maintaining intestinal barrier function may be the key to preventing damage from acute pancreatitis (AP). The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase  pathway (PI3K/PKB) plays a role in AP. However, the exact effect of PI3K/PKB on injury associated with SAP has not yet been found.The present study was aimed at investigating the impact of wortmannin (WT), a PI3K/PKB inhibitor, on intestinal barrier function in SAP rats.The rats were divided into 3 groups: 1) the Sham Surgery group (SS), whose duodenum and pancreas were flipped 3 times (n = 18); 2) the pancreatitis group (SAP), who were injected through retrograde pancreatic duct injection with 5% sodium taurocholate (n = 18); and 3) the WSAP intervention group (SAP+WT). Serum alpha-amylase levels, plasma endogenous endotoxin, hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, intestinal mucosa electron microscopy, intestinal permeability, and expression of p-PKB (phosphorylated protein kinase ) were measured.In our findings under an electron microscope, the SAP group presented cell edema and mitochondrial vacuolated degeneration, sparsely arranged microvilli,  damage, and widening, while the WSAP group exhibited less change and lower pancreas scores (7.4 ±1.14, 10.2 ±1.48 and 12.0 ±1.58 for 3 h, 6 h and 12 h, respectively) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the plasma endogenous endotoxin levels and Evans blue content of the WSAP group was significantly lower at all timepoints than in the SAP group (p < 0.05). Western blotting showed that p-PKB expression was lower in the WSAP group than in the SAP group (p < 0.05). Our study suggests that WT relieves intestinal permeability changes in SAP rats and may be dose-dependent.The PI3K/PKB signal pathway may involve SAP-related intestinal injuries and WT may relieve SAP intestinal injuries through the PI3K/PKB pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30322047>Bowman‒Birk Inhibitor Suppresses Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 Infection of Human Cervical Epithelial Cells.</a></h2><p>The Bowman‒Birk inhibitor (BBI), a protease inhibitor derived from soybeans, has been extensively studied in anti-tumor and anti-inflammation research. We recently reported that BBI has an anti-HIV-1 property in primary human macrophages. Because HSV-2 infection plays a role in facilitating HIV-1 sexual transmission, we thus examined whether BBI has the ability to inhibit HSV-2 infection. We demonstrated that BBI could potently inhibit HSV-2 replication in human cervical epithelial cells (End1/E6E7). This BBI-mediated HSV-2 inhibition was partially through blocking HSV-2-mediated activation of NF-κ and p38 MAPK pathways. In addition, BBI could activate the JAK/STAT pathway and enhance the expression of several antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Furthermore, BBI treatment of End1/E6E7 cells upregulated the expression of  proteins and reduced HSV-2-mediated cellular ubiquitinated proteins' degradation through suppressing the ubiquitin‒proteasome system. These observations indicate that BBI may have therapeutic potential for the prevention and treatment of HSV-2 infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31389714>Effects of a feed additive blend on broilers challenged with heat stress.</a></h2><p>We evaluated a blend of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA), organic acids, and a polyphenol antioxidant on gut integrity. Eighty Ross Broilers were exposed to 20-22°C (control - normothermic) or to 35-39.5°C (heat stress) for eight hours a day for a period of 1 or 5 days. Birds were fed a standard diet, or a diet supplemented with the test blend. Thereafter, birds were euthanized, and intestinal sections were excised for morphological, morphometric and gene expression analyses. Blood samples were collected for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) determination. Heart and liver tissues were used to quantify the expression of heat shock proteins 60 and 70 (HSP60 and HSP70, respectively) and inhibitor of kappa light chain gene enhancer in  cells alpha (IKBA). The jejunum was the most sensitive intestinal section, where heat stress modulated the expression of HSP70, of the inflammatory markers IKBA, interleukin 8 (IL-8), interferon gamma (IFNγ), and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Moreover, expression of  (CLDN1, ZO1 and ZO2) and nutrient transporters (PEPT1 and EAAT3) was modulated especially in the jejunum. In conclusion, the feed additive blend protected intestines during heat stress from the decrease in villus height and crypt depth, and from the increase in villus width. Especially in the jejunum, heat stress played an important role by modulating oxidative stress and inflammation, impairing gut integrity and nutrient transport, and such deleterious effects were alleviated by the feed additive blend.

Identification of membrane proteins playing an important role in these membrane domains has progressed and numerous studies have been performed on the functional analysis of these membrane proteins. On the other hand, the precise roles of membrane lipids in the organization of these membrane domains are largely unknown. Historically, the concept of lipid raft arose from the analysis of lipid composition of the apical membrane, and it can be said that epithelial cells are an optimal experimental model for elucidating the functions of lipids. In this review, I discuss the role of lipids in the formation of epithelial polarity and in the formation of cell membrane structures of epithelial cells such as microvilli in the apical domain, cell-cell adhesion apparatus in the lateral domain and cell-matrix adhesion in the basal domain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30629442>Palmitoylation of Claudin-5 Proteins Influences Their Lipid Domain Affinity and  Assembly at the Blood-Brain Barrier Interface.</a></h2><p>Post-translational lipid modification of integral membrane proteins is recognized as a key mechanism to modulate protein-protein and membrane-protein associations. Despite numerous reports of lipid-modified proteins, molecular-level understanding of the influence of lipid-modification of key membrane proteins remains elusive. This study focuses on the lipid modification of one such protein-claudin-5, a critical component of the blood-brain barrier . Claudin-5 proteins are responsible for regulating the size and charge-selective permeability at the blood-brain interface. Palmitoylation of the claudin family of proteins is implicated in influencing the  permeability in prior experimental studies. Here, we investigate the impact of palmitoylation on claudin-5 self-assembly using multiscale molecular simulations. To elucidate protein-membrane interactions, we used three model membrane compositions (endoplasmic reticulum, cholesterol-enriched endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane) that mimic the complexity of cell organelles encountered by a typical membrane protein in its secretion pathway. The results show that palmitoylation enhances protein's affinity for cholesterol-rich domains in a membrane, and it can elicit a site-specific response based on the location of the palmitoyl chain on the protein. Also, in claudin-5 self-assembly, palmitoylation restricts specific protein-protein conformations. Overall, this study demonstrates the significance of post-translational lipid modification of proteins in cellular and subcellular membranes, and the impact palmitoylation can have on critical cellular functions of the protein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30209565>Intranasal co-administration of recombinant active fragment of Zonula occludens toxin and truncated recombinant EspB triggers potent systemic, mucosal immune responses and reduces span of E. coli O157:H7 fecal shedding in BALB/c mice.</a></h2><p>Escherichia coli O157:H7 with its traits such as intestinal colonization and fecal-oral route of transmission demands mucosal vaccine development. E. coli secreted protein  (EspB) is one of the key type III secretory system (TTSS) targets for mucosal candidate vaccine due to its indispensable role in the pathogenesis of E. coli O157:H7. However, mucosally administered recombinant proteins have low immunogenicity which could be overcome by the use of mucosal adjuvants. The quest for safe, potent mucosal adjuvant has recognized ΔG fragment of Zonula occludens toxin of Vibrio cholerae with such properties. ΔG enhances mucosal permeability via the paracellular route by altering epithelial  structure in a reversible, ephemeral and non-toxic manner. Therefore, we tested whether recombinant ΔG intranasally co-administered with truncated EspB (EspB + ΔG) could serve as an effective mucosal adjuvant. Results showed that EspB + ΔG group induced higher systemic IgG and mucosal IgA than EspB alone. Moreover, EspB alone developed Th2 type response with IgG1/IgG2a ratio (1.64) and IL-4, IL-10 cytokines whereas that of EspB + ΔG group generated mixed Th1/Th2 type immune response evident from IgG1/IgG2a ratio (1.17) as well as IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-γ cytokine levels compared to control. Sera of EspB + ΔG group inhibited TTSS mediated haemolysis of murine RBCs more effectively compared to EspB, control group and sera of both EspB + ΔG, EspB group resulted in similar levels of efficacious reduction in E. coli O157:H7 adherence to Caco-2 cells compared to control. Moreover, vaccination with EspB + ΔG resulted in significant reduction in E. coli O157:H7 fecal shedding compared to EspB and control group in experimentally challenged streptomycin-treated mice. These results demonstrate mucosal adjuvanticity of ΔG co-administered with EspB in enhancing overall immunogenicity to reduce E. coli O157:H7 shedding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30510535>Exploratory Investigation of Intestinal Function and Bacterial Translocation After Focal Cerebral Ischemia in the Mouse.</a></h2><p> The gut communicates with the brain bidirectionally via neural, humoral and immune pathways. All these pathways are affected by acute brain lesions, such as stroke. Brain-gut communication may therefore impact on the overall outcome after CNS-injury. Until now, contradictory reports on intestinal function and translocation of gut bacteria after experimental stroke have been published. Accordingly, we aimed to specifically investigate the effects of transient focal cerebral ischemia on intestinal permeability, gut associated lymphoid tissue and bacterial translocation in an exploratory study using a well-characterized murine stroke model.  After 60 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) we assessed intestinal morphology (time points after surgery day 0, 3, 5, 14, 21) and  protein expression (occludin and claudin-1 at day 1 and 3) in 12-week-old male C57Bl/6J mice. Lactulose/mannitol/sucralose test was performed to assess intestinal permeability 24-72 h after surgery. To investigate the influence of cerebral ischemia on the local immune system of the gut, main immune cell populations in Peyer's patches (PP) were quantified by flow cytometry. Finally, we evaluated bacterial translocation to extraintestinal organs 24 and 72 h after MCAO by microbiological culture and fluorescence  hybridization targeting bacterial 16S rRNA.  Transient MCAO decreased claudin-1 expression in the ileum but not in the colon. Intestinal morphology (assessed by light microscopy) and permeability did not change measurably after MCAO. After MCAO, animals had significantly fewer  cells in PP compared to naïve mice.  In a murine model of stroke, which leads to large brain infarctions in the middle cerebral artery territory, we did not find evidence for overt alterations neither in gut morphology, barrier proteins and permeability nor presence of intestinal bacterial translocation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31257297>Anti-RelA siRNA-Encapsulated Flexible Liposome with -Opening Peptide as a Non-invasive Topical Therapeutic for Atopic Dermatitis.</a></h2><p>Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been proposed as a novel treatment for atopic dermatitis (AD) because it suppresses sequence-specific mRNA expression. Indeed siRNA-based therapy achieves an almost complete cure with fewer side effects than currently available treatments. However, the  in the granular layer of the epidermis in the atopic skin are barriers to siRNA delivery. We previously reported the potential clinical utility of AT1002, a peptide that opens . In the present study, we evaluated a topical siRNA-based therapy for AD using AT1002 in combination with a flexible liposome. The 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE)/cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHEMS) liposome was chosen as a carrier for siRNA because of its highly flexible structure and permeability. We prepared siRNA-encapsulated DOPE/CHEMS liposomes and examined their physical properties, safety, uptake into RAW264.7 cells, and topical application in healthy and AD-affected skin. We then assessed the efficacy of anti-nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ) (RelA) siRNA (siRelA)-encapsulated DOPE/CHEMS liposomes with AT1002 in AD model mice. The siRNA-DOPE/CHEMS liposomes were absorbed significantly better than siRNA alone and they enhanced siRNA skin penetration without toxicity. Moreover, siRelA-DOPE/CHEMS liposomes with AT1002 alleviated AD symptoms and reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines in AD model mice. Therefore, the combination of AT1002 and DOPE/CHEMS liposomes could be a dermally applied RNA interference therapeutic system for effective RNA delivery and AD treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29913111>Glial-derived neurotrophic factor is essential for blood-nerve barrier functional recovery in an experimental murine model of traumatic peripheral neuropathy.</a></h2><p>There is emerging evidence that glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a potent inducer of restrictive barrier function in -forming microvascular endothelium and epithelium, including the human blood-nerve barrier (BNB) in vitro. We sought to determine the role of GDNF in restoring BNB function in vivo by evaluating sciatic nerve horseradish peroxidase (HRP) permeability in tamoxifen-inducible GDNF conditional knockout (CKO) adult mice following non-transecting crush injury via electron microscopy, with appropriate wildtype (WT) and heterozygous (HET) littermate controls. A total of 24 age-, genotype- and sex-matched mice >12 weeks of age were injected with 30 mg/kg HRP via tail vein injection 7 or 14 days following unilateral sciatic nerve crush, and both sciatic nerves were harvested 30 minutes later for morphometric assessment by light and electron microscopy. The number and percentage of HRP-permeable endoneurial microvessels were ascertained to determine the effect of GDNF in restoring barrier function in vivo. Following sciatic nerve crush, there was significant upregulation in GDNF protein expression in WT and HET mice that was abrogated in CKO mice. GDNF significantly restored sciatic nerve BNB HRP impermeability to near normal levels by day 7, with complete restoration seen by day 14 in WT and HET mice. A significant recovery lag was observed in CKO mice. This effect was independent on VE-Cadherin or claudin-5 expression on endoneurial microvessels. These results imply an important role of GDNF in restoring restrictive BNB function in vivo, suggesting a potential strategy to re-establish the restrictive endoneurial microenvironment following traumatic peripheral neuropathies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30109442>Nephrotoxicity and Kidney Transport Assessment on 3D Perfused Proximal Tubules.</a></h2><p>Proximal tubules in the kidney play a crucial role in reabsorbing and eliminating substrates from the body into the urine, leading to high local concentrations of xenobiotics. This makes the proximal tubule a major target for drug toxicity that needs to be evaluated during the drug development process. Here, we describe an advanced in vitro model consisting of fully polarized renal proximal tubular epithelial cells cultured in a microfluidic system. Up to 40 leak- tubules were cultured on this platform that provides access to the basolateral as well as the apical side of the epithelial cells. Exposure to the nephrotoxicant cisplatin caused a dose-dependent disruption of the epithelial barrier, a decrease in viability, an increase in effluent LDH activity, and changes in expression of  marker zona-occludence 1, actin, and DNA-damage marker H2A.X, as detected by immunostaining. Activity and inhibition of the efflux pumps P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance protein (MRP) were demonstrated using fluorescence-based transporter assays. In addition, the transepithelial transport function from the basolateral to the apical side of the proximal tubule was studied. The apparent permeability of the fluorescent P-gp substrate rhodamine 123 was decreased by 35% by co-incubation with cyclosporin A. Furthermore, the activity of the glucose transporter SGLT2 was demonstrated using the fluorescent glucose analog 6-NBDG which was sensitive to inhibition by phlorizin. Our results demonstrate that we developed a functional 3D perfused proximal tubule model with advanced renal epithelial characteristics that can be used for drug screening studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30360471>Artichoke Polyphenols Produce Skin Anti-Age Effects by Improving Endothelial Cell Integrity and Functionality.</a></h2><p>Artichoke is a characteristic crop of the Mediterranean area, recognized for its nutritional value and therapeutic properties due to the presence of bioactive components such as polyphenols, inulin, vitamins and minerals. Artichoke is mainly consumed after home and/or industrial processing, and the undersized heads, not suitable for the market, can be used for the recovery of bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, for cosmetic applications. In this paper, the potential skin anti-age effect of a polyphenolic artichoke extract on endothelial cells was investigated. The methodology used was addressed to evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and the improvement of gene expression of some youth markers. The results showed that the artichoke extract was constituted by 87% of chlorogenic, 3,5--dicaffeoylquinic, and 1,5--dicaffeoylquinic acids. The extract induced important molecular markers responsible for the microcirculation and vasodilatation of endothelial cells, acted as a potential anti-inflammatory agent, protected the lymphatic vessels from oxidative damage by ROS formation, and enhanced the cellular cohesion by reinforcing the  complex. In addition, the artichoke extract, through the modulation of molecular pathways, improved the expression of genes involved in anti-ageing mechanisms. Finally, clinical testing on human subjects highlighted the enhancement by 19.74% of roughness and 11.45% of elasticity from using an artichoke extract cosmetic formulation compared to placebo cream.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30307367>Blood Vessel Epicardial Substance (BVES) in junctional signaling and cancer.</a></h2><p>Blood vessel epicardial substance (BVES) is a  associated protein that was originally discovered from a cDNA screen of the developing heart. Research over the last decade has shown that not only is BVES is expressed in cardiac and skeletal tissue, but BVES is also is expressed throughout the gastrointestinal epithelium. Mice lacking BVES sustain worse intestinal injury and inflammation. Furthermore, BVES is suppressed in gastrointestinal cancers, and mouse modeling has shown that loss of BVES promotes tumor formation. Recent work from multiple laboratories has revealed that BVES can regulate several molecular pathways, including cAMP, WNT, and promoting the degradation of the oncogene, c-Myc. This review will summarize our current understanding of how BVES regulates the intestinal epithelium and discuss how BVES functions at the molecular level to preserve epithelial phenotypes and suppress tumorigenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30859754>Glibenclamide ameliorates the disrupted blood-brain  in experimental intracerebral hemorrhage by inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.</a></h2><p>Glibenclamide is a widely used sulfonylurea drug prescribed to treat type II diabetes mellitus. Previous studies have demonstrated that glibenclamide has neuroprotective effects in central nervous system injury. However, the exact mechanism by which glibenclamide acts on the blood-brain  (BBB) after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to validate the neuroprotective effects of glibenclamide on ICH and to explore the mechanisms underlying these effects.We investigated the effects of glibenclamide on experimental ICH using the autologous blood infusion model. Glibenclamide was administrated either immediately or 2 hr after ICH. Brain edema was quantified using the wet-dry method 3 days after injury. BBB integrity was evaluated by Evans Blue extravasation and degradation of the tight junction protein zona occludens-1 (ZO-1). mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Activation of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor with a pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and cell viability were also measured in cerebral microvascular endothelial .End3 cells exposed to hemin. Neurological changes were evaluated by the Garcia score and rotarod test.After ICH, the brain water content, Evans Blue extravasation, and inflammatory cytokines decreased significantly in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the experimental compared to the vehicle group. Glibenclamide treatment and NLRP3 knockdown significantly reduced hemin-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, release of extracellular lactate dehydrogenase, apoptosis, and loss of ZO-1 in .End3 cells. However, NLRP3 knockdown abolished the protective effect of glibenclamide.Glibenclamide maintained BBB integrity in experimental ICH by inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in microvessel endothelial cells. Our findings will contribute to elucidating the pharmacological mechanism of action of glibenclamide and to developing a novel therapy for clinical ICH.© 2019 The Authors.

Previous studies have shown the satisfactory anti-inflammatory role of PPARγ in experimental colitis models, mainly through negatively regulating several transcription factors such as nuclear factor-κ (NF-κ). Therefore, regulating PPARγ and PPARγ-related pathways has great promise for treating ulcerative colitis (UC). In the present study, our objective was to explore the potential effect of naringin on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced UC in mice and its involved potential mechanism. We found that naringin significantly relieved DSS-induced disease activities index (DAI), colon length shortening, and colonic pathological damage. Exploration of the potential mechanisms demonstrated that naringin significantly activated DSS-induced PPARγ and subsequently suppressed NF-κ activation. PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 largely abrogated the roles of naringin in vitro. Moreover, DSS induced the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and (NOD)-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome was inhibited by naringin.  (TJ) architecture in naringin groups was also maintained by regulating zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression. These results suggested that naringin may be a potential natural agent for protecting mice from DSS-induced UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30745566>Macrophage-dependent neutrophil recruitment is impaired under conditions of increased intestinal permeability in JAM-A-deficient mice.</a></h2><p>Junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on leukocytes, endothelia, and epithelia that regulates biological processes including barrier function and immune responses. While JAM-A has been reported to facilitate tissue infiltration of leukocytes under inflammatory conditions, the contributions of leukocyte-expressed JAM-A in vivo remain unresolved. We investigated the role of leukocyte-expressed JAM-A in acute peritonitis induced by zymosan, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or TNFα using mice with selective loss of JAM-A in myelomonocytic cells (LysM-Cre;Jam-a). Surprisingly, in LysM-Cre;Jam-a mice, loss of JAM-A did not affect neutrophil (PMN) recruitment into the peritoneum in response to zymosan, LPS, or TNFα although it was significantly reduced in Jam-a mice. In parallel, Jam-a peritoneal macrophages exhibited diminished CXCL1 chemokine production and decreased activation of NF-kB, whereas those from LysM-Cre;Jam-a mice were unaffected. Using Villin-Cre;Jam-a mice, targeted loss of JAM-A on intestinal epithelial cells resulted in increased intestinal permeability along with reduced peritoneal PMN migration as well as lower levels of CXCL1 and active NF-kB similar to that observed in Jam-a animals. Interestingly, in germ-free Villin-Cre;Jam-a mice, PMN recruitment was unaffected suggesting dependence on gut microbiota. Such observations highlight the functional link between a leaky gut and regulation of innate immune responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30329115>Effect of stocking density and sex on growth performance, meat quality, and intestinal barrier function in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>The objective of the current experiment was to investigate the effect of stocking density and sex on growth performance, meat quality, and intestinal barrier function in broiler chickens. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement consisting of sex and four different stocking densities in battery cages. A total of 540 1-d-old Ross 308 broiler chickens were allotted to one of eight treatments with five replicates. Within each sex, birds were raised at four different stocking densities of 15.2, 20.2, 25.3, or 30.4 birds/m2 from 1 to 28 d of age. Different stocking densities were achieved by raising a different number of birds per battery cage with identical floor size (0.76 m × 0.78 m). At the end of the experiment, two birds per replicate were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation to collect tissue samples for further analyses. Results indicated that no interactions between sex and stocking density were observed for all measurements except for serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations. Increasing stocking density decreased (linear, P < 0.01) body weight gain and feed intake, but had no negative effects on meat quality. Trans-epithelial electrical resistance values, a measure of intestinal permeability, were decreased (linear, P < 0.01) with increasing stocking density, regardless of sex. Accordingly, serum LPS concentrations were increased (linear, P < 0.01) with increasing stocking density. However, increasing stocking density increased serum LPS concentrations in male broiler chickens, but had no effects on female broiler chickens, showing an interaction (P < 0.01). The expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and junctional adhesion molecule  (JAM-2) was decreased (linear, P < 0.05) with increasing stocking density. In conclusion, increasing stocking density decreases broiler performance regardless of sex and this negative effect is likely associated with decreased intestinal barrier function.© 2018 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30280608>Oral insulin delivery by carboxymethyl-β-cyclodextrin-grafted chitosan nanoparticles for improving diabetic treatment.</a></h2><p>In this paper, a new oral insulin formulation, insulin-loaded carboxymethyl-β-cyclodextrin-grafted chitosan nanoparticles (insulin/CMCD-g-CS NPs), was fabricated by ionic crosslinking technique. The therapeutic efficacy of new formulation was investigated in detail. Firstly, the CMCD-g-CS was synthesized by EDC-mediated esterification reaction. The prepared CMCD-g-CS exhibited favourable loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency of drug. The release experiment in vitro showed that the nanocarrier could efficiently protect encapsulated insulin at simulated gastric environment and release drug in the simulated colonic fluid.

However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. We aim to investigate the effect of QBD on the mouse model of ulcerative colitis and its possible mechanism.C57/bL mice were given 5% DSS to induce colitis and were divided as QBD and mesalazine group. Weight, faeces and mental status were recorded each day and the histopathological changes (goblet cells etc) of the colon were observed after sacrificed. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 4000 was measured to reflect the intestinal mucosal permeability. In addition, cell -related proteins and possible signal pathways were investigated.QingBai decoction could significantly alleviate the inflammation and the protection effect of colitis is comparable as those in mesalazine enema group. It was found that the permeability reduced significantly with QBD treatment vs the control group, while no significant difference between the mesalazine and QBD groups. QBD treatment could upregulate the expression of  complex（ZO-1, claudin-1 and occludin）and muc-2 expression. It significantly reduced the production and secretion of serials proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, Kc and TNF-α) compared with the control group. Meanwhile, NF-κ and Notch pathways were regulated.QingBai decoction can effectively alleviate intestinal inflammation and mucosal barrier function in colitis mice, and the mechanism may be related to the inhibition of inflammatory cascade as well as enhanced mucus layer barrier and mechanical barrier function by NF-κ and Notch signalling.© 2019 The Authors.

The amino acids LTLRSSSQNSSDKPV at positions 78‑92 of mTNF‑α may constitute the dominant  cell epitope. Based on this finding, an eight‑branched peptide structure, the TNF‑α ‑cell epitope/IL‑1β helper T‑cell epitope complex MAP vaccine, was synthesized. Indirect ELISA confirmed that MAP had a high affinity with commercialized mTNF‑α antibodies. Meanwhile, MAP induced high specific antibody titers in vivo, reduced the DAI score, serum MPO activity, colorectal lymph node colony count, ultrastructural injuries, colon tissue histological index score and MPO activity in UC mice, while increasing the expression levels of occludin, claudin1 and ZO1 in colon tissues. The synthetic complex MAP vaccine has good antigenicity and immunogenicity, and can alleviate UC in mouse models.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208230>Initiating TrkB/Akt Signaling Cascade Preserves Blood-Brain Barrier after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Rats.</a></h2><p>The integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a vital role in affecting the prognosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This study aimed to investigate activation of the Tropomyosin-related kinase receptor  (TrkB) and its downstream signaling pathway on preserving BBB breakdown after experimental SAH. An endovascular perforation SAH model was applied. N-[2-(5-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl) ethyl]-2- oxopiperidine-3-carboxamide (HIOC), the derivative of N-acetyl serotonin (NAS), was intracerebroventricularly administered 3 h after SAH induction. The neurologic scores and brain water content were evaluated in an outcome study. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining were used to investigate the mechanism. The results indicated that HIOC activated the TrkB/Akt pathway, increased the  expression, improved neurologic deficits, and ameliorated brain edema after SAH. Thus, we conclude that initiating the TrkB/Akt signaling cascade preserves BBB breakdown after experimental SAH in rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29947801>An FRMD4B variant suppresses dysplastic photoreceptor lesions in models of enhanced S-cone syndrome and of Nrl deficiency.</a></h2><p>Photoreceptor dysplasia, characterized by formation of folds and (pseudo-)rosettes in the outer retina, is associated with loss of functional nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group E member 3 (NR2E3) and neural retina leucine-zipper (NRL) in both humans and mice. A sensitized chemical mutagenesis study to identify genetic modifiers that suppress photoreceptor dysplasia in Nr2e3rd7mutant mice identified line Tvrm222, which exhibits a normal fundus appearance in the presence of the rd7 mutation. The Tvrm222 modifier of Nr2e3rd7/rd7 was localized to Chromosome 6 and identified as a missense mutation in the FERM domain containing 4B (Frmd4b) gene. The variant is predicted to cause the substitution of a serine residue 938 with proline (S938P). The Frmd4bTvrm222 allele was also found to suppress outer nuclear layer (ONL) rosettes in Nrl-/- mice. Fragmentation of the external limiting membrane (ELM), normally observed in rd7 and Nrl-/-mouse retinas, was absent in the presence of the Frmd4bTvrm222 allele. FRMD4B, a binding partner of cytohesin 3, is proposed to participate in cell  remodeling. Its biological function in photoreceptor dysplasia has not been previously examined. In vitro experiments showed that the FRMD4B938P variant fails to be efficiently recruited to the cell surface upon insulin stimulation. In addition, we found a reduction in protein kinase  phosphorylation and increased levels of cell  proteins, Catenin beta 1 and  protein 1, associated with the cell membrane in Tvrm222 retinas. Taken together, this study reveals a critical role of FRMD4B in maintaining ELM integrity and in rescuing morphological abnormalities of the ONL in photoreceptor dysplasia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30726749>Chitosan coated human serum albumin nanoparticles: A promising strategy for nose-to-brain drug delivery.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was the development of human serum albumin nanoparticles (HSA NPs) as nose-to-brain carrier. To strengthen, the efficacy of nanoparticles as drug delivery system, the influence of chitosan (CS) coating on the performance of HSA NPs was investigated for nasal application. HSA NPs were prepared by desolvation technique. CS coating was obtained adding the CS solution to HSA NPs. The mean particle sizes was 241 ± 18 nm and 261 ± 8 nm and the ζ-potential was -47 ± 3 mV and + 45 ± 1 mV for HSA NPs and CS-HSA NPs, respectively. The optimized formulations showed excellent stability upon storage both as suspension and as freeze-dried product after 3 months. The mucoadhesion properties were assessed by turbidimetric and indirect method. NPs were loaded with sulforhodamine  sodium salt as model drug and the effect of CS coating was investigated performing release studies, permeation and uptake experiments using Caco-2 and hCMEC/D3 cells as model of the nasal epithelium and blood-brain barrier, respectively. Furthermore, ex vivo diffusion experiments have been carried out using rabbit nasal mucosa. Finally, the ability of the formulations to reversibly open  and gap  was explored by western blotting and RT-PCR analyzing in both Caco-2 and hCMEC/D3 cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

However, the mechanisms by which vitamin D and vitamin D receptor reduce inflammation in lung diseases remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the expression and cell-specific distribution of  and adherens  in the lungs of vitamin D receptor-deficient (VDR) mice. Our results demonstrated that mRNA and protein levels of claudin-2, claudin-4 and claudin-12 were significantly decreased in the lungs of VDR mice. Other  and adherens  proteins, such as ZO-1, occludin, claudin-10, β-catenin, and VE-cadherin, showed significant differences in expression in the lungs of VDR and wild-type mice. These data suggest that altered expression of  and adherens  molecules, especially of claudin-2, -4, -10, -12, and -18, after chronic pneumonia caused by VDR deletion could increase lung permeability.Therefore, VDR may play an important role in maintaining pulmonary barrier integrity. Further studies should confirm whether vitamin D/VDR is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of lung diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30117097>Mechanisms of Blood Brain Barrier Disruption by Different Types of Bacteria, and Bacterial-Host Interactions Facilitate the Bacterial Pathogen Invading the Brain.</a></h2><p>This review aims to elucidate the different mechanisms of blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption that may occur due to invasion by different types of bacteria, as well as to show the bacteria-host interactions that assist the bacterial pathogen in invading the brain. For example, platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) is responsible for brain invasion during the adhesion of pneumococci to brain endothelial cells, which might lead to brain invasion. Additionally, the major adhesin of the pneumococcal pilus-1, RrgA is able to bind the BBB endothelial receptors: polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1), thus leading to invasion of the brain. Moreover, Streptococcus pneumoniae choline binding protein A (CbpA) targets the common carboxy-terminal domain of the laminin receptor (LR) establishing initial contact with brain endothelium that might result in BBB invasion. Furthermore, BBB disruption may occur by S. pneumoniae penetration through increasing in pro-inflammatory markers and endothelial permeability. In contrast, adhesion, invasion, and translocation through or between endothelial cells can be done by S. pneumoniae without any disruption to the vascular endothelium, upon BBB penetration. Internalins (InlA and InlB) of Listeria monocytogenes interact with its cellular receptors E-cadherin and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) to facilitate invading the brain. L. monocytogenes species activate NF-κ in endothelial cells, encouraging the expression of P- and E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and Vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1), as well as IL-6 and IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), all these markers assist in BBB disruption. Bacillus anthracis species interrupt both adherens  (AJs) and  (TJs), leading to BBB disruption. Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) permeability and BBB disruption are induced via interendothelial  proteins reduction as well as up-regulation of IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1, macrophage inflammatory proteins-1 alpha (MIP1α) markers in Staphylococcus aureus species. Streptococcus agalactiae or Group  Streptococcus toxins (GBS) enhance IL-8 and ICAM-1 as well as nitric oxide (NO) production from endothelial cells via the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) enhancement, resulting in BBB disruption. While Gram-negative bacteria, Haemophilus influenza OmpP2 is able to target the common carboxy-terminal domain of LR to start initial interaction with brain endothelium, then invade the brain. H. influenza type  (HiB), can induce BBB permeability through TJ disruption. LR and PAFR binding sites have been recognized as common routes of CNS entrance by Neisseria meningitidis. N. meningitidis species also initiate binding to BMECs and induces AJs deformation, as well as inducing specific cleavage of the TJ component occludin through the release of host MMP-8. Escherichia coli bind to BMECs through LR, resulting in IL-6 and IL-8 release and iNOS production, as well as resulting in disassembly of TJs between endothelial cells, facilitating BBB disruption. Therefore, obtaining knowledge of BBB disruption by different types of bacterial species will provide a picture of how the bacteria enter the central nervous system (CNS) which might support the discovery of therapeutic strategies for each bacteria to control and manage infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30383855>Enteric infection coupled with chronic Notch pathway inhibition alters colonic mucus composition leading to dysbiosis, barrier disruption and colitis.</a></h2><p>Intestinal mucus layer disruption and gut microflora modification in conjunction with  (TJ) changes can increase colonic permeability that allows bacterial dissemination and intestinal and systemic disease. We showed previously that Citrobacter rodentium (CR)-induced colonic crypt hyperplasia and/or colitis is regulated by a functional cross-talk between the Notch and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. In the current study, mucus analysis in the colons of CR-infected (108 CFUs) and Notch blocker Dibenzazepine (DBZ, i.p.; 10μmol/Kg .w.)-treated mice revealed significant alterations in the composition of trace O-glycans and complex type and hybrid N-glycans, compared to CR-infected mice alone that preceded/accompanied alterations in 16S rDNA microbial community structure and elevated EUB338 staining. While mucin-degrading bacterium, Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) along with Enterobacteriaceae belonging to Proteobacteria phyla increased in the feces, antimicrobial peptides Angiogenin-4, Intelectin-1 and Intelectin-2, and ISC marker Dclk1, exhibited dramatic decreases in the colons of CR-infected/DBZ-treated mice. Also evident was a loss of TJ and adherens  protein immuno-staining within the colonic crypts that negatively impacted paracellular barrier. These changes coincided with the loss of Notch signaling and exacerbation of mucosal injury. In response to a cocktail of antibiotics (Metronidazole/ciprofloxacin) for 10 days, there was increased survival that coincided with: i) decreased levels of Proteobacteria, ii) elevated Dclk1 levels in the crypt and, iii) reduced paracellular permeability. Thus, enteric infections that interfere with Notch activity may promote mucosal dysbiosis that is preceded by changes in mucus composition. Controlled use of antibiotics seems to alleviate gut dysbiosis but may be insufficient to promote colonic crypt regeneration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30354300>Whole-Exome Sequencing Identifies Pathogenic Variants in TJP1 Gene Associated With Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy.</a></h2><p>Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is an inherited cardiac disease characterized by progressive fibro-fatty myocardial replacement, ventricular arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden death. Causative mutations can be identified in 60% of patients, and most of them are found in genes encoding mechanical  proteins of the intercalated disk.Whole-exome sequencing was performed on the proband of an ACM family. Sanger sequencing was used to screen for mutations the  protein 1 ( TJP1) gene in unrelated patients. Predictions of local structure content and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the structural impact of the variants.A novel c.2006A>G p.(Y669C) variant in TJP1 gene was identified by whole-exome sequencing in a patient with ACM. TJP1 encodes zonula occludens 1, an intercalated disk protein interacting with proteins of gap  and area composita. Additional rare TJP1 variants have been identified in 1 of 40 Italian probands (c.793C>T p.(R265W)) with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and in 2 of 43 Dutch/German patients (c. 986C>T, p.(S329L) and c.1079A>T, p.(D360V)) with dilated cardiomyopathy and recurrent ventricular tachycardia. The p.(D360V) variant was identified in a proband also carrying the p.(I156N) pathogenic variant in DSP. All 4 TJP1 variants are predicted to be deleterious and affect highly conserved amino acids, either at the GUK (guanylate kinase)-like domain (p.(Y669C)) or at the disordered region of the protein between the PDZ2 and PDZ3 domains (p.(R265W), p.(S329L), and p.(D360V)). The local unfolding induced by the former promotes structural rearrangements of the GUK domain, whereas the others are predicted to impair the function of the disordered region. Furthermore, rare variants in TJP1 are statistically enriched in patients with ACM relative to controls.We provide here the first evidence linking likely pathogenic TJP1 variants to ACM. Prevalence and pathogenic mechanism of TJP1-mediated ACM remain to be determined.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562918>Geniposide attenuates neonatal mouse brain injury after hypoxic-ischemia involving the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Perinatal hypoxic-ischemia (HI) is a leading cause of acute mortality and neurologic complications in newborns. Geniposide, a natural product extracted from the herb Gardenia jasminoides, has been shown to possess neuroprotective effects in neurologic deficits. This study aims to investigate whether Geniposide has therapeutic potential to HI brain injury and the underlying mechanisms. C57/bl6 mice were subjected to HI insult on postnatal day 10. Geniposide (20 mg/kg .w.) was administered intragastrically every day after HI insult for 7 successional days. Then mice at P18 were sacrificed and brain tissues were collected for further analysis. Geniposide treatment significantly inhibited cell apoptosis, reduced serum IgG leakage into brain tissue, attenuated astrogliosis and microgliosis, prevented loss of pericytes, loss of  and adherens  proteins. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which related proteins were downregulated after HI insult, was activated by Geniposide treatment. Geniposide treatment after neonatal HI insult attenuated HI-induced cell apoptosis, IgG leakage, microgliosis, astrogliosis, pericytes loss and  protein degradation. Geniposide could protect against HI-induced brain injury, which might be through the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

The Maelstrom (Mael) is identified essential for spermatogenesis in both Drosophila and mouse, though the mechanisms appear to differ. It was initially found that Mael gene is necessary for axis specification of oocytes in Drosophila, and recent studies suggested that Mael participates in the piRNA pathway. In this study, we obtained Bombyx mori Mael mutants by using a binary transgenic CRISPR/Cas9 system and analyzed the function of Mael in . mori, a model lepidopteran insect. The results showed that BmMael is not necessary for piRNA pathway in the ovary of silkworm, whereas it might be essential for transposon elements (TEs) repression in testis. The BmMael mutation resulted in male sterility, and further analysis established that BmMael was essential for spermatogenesis. The spermatogenesis defects occurred in the elongation stage and resulted in nuclei concentration arrest. RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analyses demonstrated that spermatogenesis defects were associated with  and apoptosis. We also found that BmMael was not involved in the silkworm sex determination pathway. Our data provide insights into the biological function of BmMael in male spermatogenesis and might be useful for developing novel methods to control lepidopteron pests.Copyright © 2019.

In contrast, the role of PKM2 in nontransformed cells is little studied, and nearly nothing is known of its role, if any, in quiescent cells. We show here that endothelial cells express PKM2 almost exclusively over PKM1. In proliferating endothelial cells, PKM2 is required to suppress p53 and maintain cell cycle progression. In sharp contrast, PKM2 has a strikingly different role in quiescent endothelial cells, where inhibition of PKM2 leads to degeneration of  and barrier function. Mechanistically, PKM2 regulates barrier function independently of its canonical activity as a pyruvate kinase. Instead, PKM2 suppresses NF-kB and its downstream target, the vascular permeability factor angiopoietin 2. As a consequence, loss of endothelial cell PKM2 in vivo predisposes mice to VEGF-induced vascular leak, and to severe bacteremia and death in response to sepsis. Together, these data demonstrate new roles of PKM2 in quiescent cells, and highlight the need for caution in developing cancer therapies that target PKM2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30372067>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Ion Selectivity in a Claudin-15 Paracellular Channel.</a></h2><p>Claudins are tissue-specific transmembrane proteins able to form  between two cells and regulate the flow of physiological solutes parallel to the cell walls, that is, the paracellular transport. Claudin-15 is highly expressed in the intestine where it forms efficient Na channels and Cl barriers. However, the molecular details of these biological complexes are still unclear. Here, the permeation process of Na, K, and Cl ions inside a refined structural model of a claudin-15 paracellular channel is investigated using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in a double-bilayer and explicit solvent. One-dimensional potential of mean force (PMF) profiles, calculated using umbrella sampling (US) simulations, show that the channel allows the passage of the two physiological cations while excluding chloride. These features are generated by the action of several acidic residues, in particular the ring of D55 residues which is located at the narrowest region of the pore, in correspondence with the energy minimum for cations and the peak for chloride. We also used the Voronoi-tessellated milestoning method to obtain additional PMF profiles and the permeation timescale of the three ions. The milestoning PMFs agree well with those obtained by US, and the rate calculation reveals that the passage of chloride is almost 30 times slower than that of sodium. Our results are consistent with the known ability of claudin-15 to regulate  selectivity and with the experimentally determined role of the acidic residues. This further validates our structural model and provides insights into the atomistic details of ion transport in paracellular channels that could be shared by other claudin-based architectures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30405936>Estrogen reinforces barrier formation and protects against tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced barrier dysfunction in oral epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Epithelial barrier dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology of periodontitis and oral lichen planus. Estrogens have been shown to enhance the physical barrier function of intestinal and esophageal epithelia, and we aimed to investigate the effect of estradiol (E2) on the regulation of physical barrier and  (TJ) proteins in human oral epithelial cell monolayers.HOK-16B cell monolayers cultured on transwells were treated with E2, an estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist (ICI 182,780), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), or dexamethasone (Dexa), and the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) was then measured. Cell proliferation was measured by the cell counting kit (CCK)-8 assay. The levels of TJ proteins and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-κ were examined by confocal microscopy.E2 treatment increased the TER and the levels of junctional adhesion molecule (JAM)-A and zonula occludens (ZO)-1 in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting cell proliferation during barrier formation. Treatment of the -junctioned cell monolayers with TNFα induced decreases in the TER and the levels of ZO-1 and nuclear translocation of NF-κ. These TNFα-induced changes were inhibited by E2, and this effect was completely reversed by co-treatment with ICI 182,780. Furthermore, E2 and Dexa presented an additive effect on the epithelial barrier function.E2 reinforces the physical barrier of oral epithelial cells through the nuclear ER-dependent upregulation of TJ proteins. The protective effect of E2 on the TNFα-induced impairment of the epithelial barrier and its additive effect with Dexa suggest its potential use to treat oral inflammatory diseases involving epithelial barrier dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926390>Impairment of pericyte-endothelium crosstalk leads to blood-brain  dysfunction following traumatic brain injury.</a></h2><p>The blood-brain  (BBB) constitutes a neurovascular unit formed by microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes. Brain pericytes are important regulators of BBB integrity, permeability, and blood flow. Pericyte loss has been implicated in injury; however, how the crosstalk among pericytes, endothelial cells, and astrocytes ultimately leads to BBB dysfunction in traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of pericyte-endothelium interaction in maintaining the BBB . TBI causes the platelet-derived growth factor- (PDGF-)/PDGF receptor-β signaling impairment that results in loss of interaction with endothelium and leads to neurovascular dysfunction. Using in vivo mild (7 psi) and moderate (15 psi) fluid percussion injury (FPI) in mice, we demonstrate the expression of various pericyte markers including PDGFR-β, NG2 and CD13 that were significantly reduced with a subsequent reduction in the expression of various integrins; adherent junction protein, N-cadherin; gap junction protein, connexin-43; and tight junction proteins such as occludin, claudin-5, ZO-1, and JAM-a. Impairment of pericyte-endothelium interaction increases the BBB permeability to water that is marked by a significant increase in aquaporin4 expression in injured animals. Similarly, pericyte-endothelium integrity impairment in FPI animals greatly increases the permeability of small-molecular-weight sodium fluorescein and high-molecular-weight-tracer Evans blue across the BBB. In addition, the injury-inflicted animals show significantly higher levels of S100β and NSE in the blood samples compared with controls. In conclusion, our data provide an insight that brain trauma causes an early impairment of pericyte-endothelium integrity and results in BBB dysregulation that initiates pathological consequences associated with TBI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We found previously that salvianolic acid  (SAB) attenuated experimental pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is driven by inflammation, but the anti-inflammatory role and mechanism of SAB on the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis is still unknown. Here, our in vivo studies showed that SAB had a strong anti-inflammatory effect on bleomycin-instilled mice by inhibiting inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory cytokine production. Moreover, SAB protected endothelial cells against oxidative stress injury and inhibited endothelial cell apoptosis in bleomycin-treated mice. The in vitro studies also showed that SAB decreased the HO-induced overproduction of reactive oxygen species to protect EA.hy926 endothelial cells from oxidative damage, and further inhibited HO-induced permeability and overexpression of pro-inflammatory molecules. The next studies revealed that SAB inhibited the HO-induced cell apoptosis and attenuated the decrease of -related gene expression, resulting in a decrease of the endothelial permeability in injured endothelial cells. Furthermore, Western blot analysis suggested that SAB decreased endothelial cell permeability and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting MAPK and NF-κ signaling pathways. Taken together, these data indicate that SAB exerted anti-inflammatory roles in pulmonary fibrosis by protection of the endothelial cells against oxidative stress injury, mediated by inhibition of endothelial permeability and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine via the MAPK and NF-κ signaling pathways.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

As a structural component of Caveolae, Cav-1 interacts with signaling molecules via a caveolin scaffolding domain (CSD) regulating cell signaling. Recent reports have shown that Cav-1 is a negative regulator in tumor metastasis. Therefore, we hypothesize that Cav-1 inhibits cell migration through its CSD. HeLa cells were engineered to overexpress Cav-1 (Cav-1 OE), Cav-1 without a functional CSD (∆CSD), or enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a control. HeLa cell migration was suppressed in Cav-1 OE cells while ∆CSD showed increased migration, which corresponded to a decrease in the  protein, zonula occludens (ZO-1). The migration phenotype was confirmed in multiple cancer cell lines. Phosphorylated STAT-3 was decreased in Cav-1 OE cells compared to control and ∆CSD cells; reducing STAT-3 expression alone decreased cell migration. ∆CSD blunted HeLa proliferation by increasing the number of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Overexpressing the CSD peptide alone suppressed HeLa cell migration and inhibited pSTAT3. These findings suggest that Cav-1 CSD may be critical in controlling the dynamic phenotype of cancer cells by facilitating the interaction of specific signal transduction pathways, regulating STAT3 and participating in a G2/M checkpoint. Modulating the CSD and targeting specific proteins may offer potential new therapies in the treatment of cancer metastasis.</p></html>
