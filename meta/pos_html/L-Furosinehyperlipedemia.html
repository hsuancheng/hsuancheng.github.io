Two hundred twenty-eight patients were studied: 114 received tirofiban (TI) and 114 received abciximab (AB) for either unstable angina (UA) or myocardial infarction (MI). All patients received aspirin, heparin, and ticlopidine or clopidogrel. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups for admitting diagnosis (UA vs MI), age, gender, ejection fraction, diabetes mellitus, prior coronary artery disease, prior myocardial infarction (MI), prior bypass surgery, hypertension, congestive heart failure, , MI type (Q vs non-Q), or location. Drug administration time (mean) was 13 hours (AB) and 24 hours (TI). All AB was administered in the catheterization laboratory as compared to TI (34% in laboratory and 66% before laboratory). More AB patients received angioplasty or stent (92% vs 80%, p = 0.008) while more TI patients had CABG (10% vs 3%, p = 0.027). In-hospital complications including death, MI, urgent revascularization, cerebrovascular accidents or transient ischemic attacks, and access site bleeding were similar (p = NS). Multivariate predictors of events (odds ratios) were prior coronary artery bypass graft (2.3), diabetes (1.7), and prior percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (1.7), but not the agent used. Over a mean follow-up of 13 months, the individual endpoints of death, MI, revascularization, or hospitalization were similar for both groups. The AB patients had improved freedom from revascularization (100% vs 81%, p = 0.015) in an emergent setting and TI patients had improved freedom from revascularization (93% vs 77%, p = 0.038) with elective procedures. Tirofiban and abciximab appear effective and safe when used for ACS when recommended dosing and precautions are followed. Major adverse outcomes are rare and bleeding complications uncommon.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15918550>Recovery from parkinson syndrome and prolonged visually evoked potentials in hepatic encephalopathy.</a></h1><p>The combination of Parkinson syndrome (PS) and prolonged visually evoked potentials (VEPs) in a single patient with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) has not been reported. A 52-year-old male with chronic HE developed PS in early 2001. Treatment with L-DOPA was only of minimal effect. In August 2001 he was admitted because of worsening PS and HE. There was anemia, , markedly elevated liver-function-parameters, hyperammonemia, elevated resting-lactate, steatosis hepatis and hepatomegalia. VEPs showed markedly prolonged P100-latencies. Under L-DOPA, pramipexol, L-ornithin-L-aspartate, paromomycin-sulfate, and lactulose liver-function-parameters normalized and PS markedly improved. In February 2003, VEPs were normal. L-DOPA was discontinued by the patient in April 2003 and pramipexol in December 2003. Since then PS did not recur. This case shows that HE may go along with reversible PS and prolonged VEPs. Under adequate therapy liver-function-parameters and VEPs normalize and PS disappears.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25819126>[Management of side-effects of targeted therapies in renal cancer: endocrine side-effects and metabolic disorders].</a></h1><p>Several types of endocrine complications and metabolic disorders can occur during treatment with targeted therapies: thyroid dysfunction, hyperglycaemia, , etc. Thyroid dysfunctions are mainly observed with  kinase inhibitors (TKI), with a high frequency with sunitinib (18 to 85%) and sorafenib (21%). Hypothyroidism can be symptomatic with clinical signs including asthenia, constipation, cold intolerance, with elevated TSH and low free T 4 levels; or subclinical with non-specific clinical signs (asthenia) with TSH less than 8-10mIU/L and free T 4 normal, and often requiring supplementation with thyroid hormones. The occurrence of thyroid dysfunction does not mean that treatment with TKI must be stopped. Thyrotoxicosis, usually transient, can precede the onset of hypothyroidism during treatment with TKI. Specialist opinion from an endocrinologist should be considered with the occurrence of thyroid dysfunction. Abnormalities in the glycaemic and lipid profile are often seen with mTOR inhibitors and require monitoring before and during the treatment, as well as a specialist opinion from an endocrinologist in the event of hyperglycaemia or dyslipidaemia.Copyright © 2011 Société Française du Cancer.

This study sought to define the role of microRNAs in that pathophysiology.Next-generation sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses identified miR-150 as a proangiogenic microRNA, which expression is significantly reduced in the ischemic muscles of hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE) mice, and in human umbilical vein endothelial cells exposed to oxidized low-density lipoprotein. Forced expression of miR-150 using a miR mimic could rescue oxidized low-density lipoprotein-mediated impairment of endothelial cell migration and tubule formation in vitro. In a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia, intramuscular injection of miR-150 mimic restored blood flow recuperation, vascular densities in ischemic muscles, and functional mobility in ApoE mice. Treatment of ApoE mice with miR-150 also increased the number and the activities of proangiogenic cells. miR-150 targets SRC kinase signaling inhibitor 1, an important regulator of Src (proto-oncogene -protein kinase Src) activity. Here we found that hypercholesterolemia and oxidized low-density lipoprotein exposure are associated with increased SRC kinase signaling inhibitor 1 expression and decreased Src activity. However, treatment with miR-150 mimic reduces SRC kinase signaling inhibitor 1 expression and restores Src and downstream endothelial nitric oxide synthase and Akt (protein kinase B) activities both in vitro and in vivo. We also demonstrate the interrelation between miR-150 and SRC kinase signaling inhibitor 1 and their importance for endothelial cell angiogenic activities.Hypercholesterolemia is associated with reduced expression of miR-150, impaired Src signaling, and inefficient neovascularization in response to ischemia. Forced expression of miR-150 using a miR mimic could constitute a novel therapeutic strategy to improve ischemia-induced neovascularization in atherosclerotic conditions.© 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16217126>Metabolic effects of melatonin on oxidative stress and diabetes mellitus.</a></h1><p>Melatonin, which is synthesized in the pineal gland and other tissues, has a variety of physiological, immunological, and biochemical functions. It is a direct scavenger of free radicals and has indirect antioxidant effects due to its stimulation of the expression and activity of antioxidative enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase, and NO synthase, in mammalian cells. Melatonin also reduces serum lipid levels in mammalian species, and helps to prevent oxidative stress in diabetic subjects. Long-term melatonin administration to diabetic rats reduced their  and hyperinsulinemia, and restored their altered ratios of polyunsaturated fatty acid in serum and tissues. It was recently reported that melatonin enhanced insulin-receptor kinase and IRS-1 phosphorylation, suggesting the potential existence of signaling pathway cross-talk between melatonin and insulin. Because TNF-alpha has been shown to impair insulin action by suppressing insulin receptor- kinase activity and its IRS-1  phosphorylation in peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle cells, it was speculated that melatonin might counteract TNF-alpha-associated insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. This review will focus on the physiological and metabolic effects of melatonin and highlight its potential use for the treatment of cholesterol/lipid and carbohydrate disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28513320>CRISPR/Cas9-based Pten knock-out and Sleeping Beauty Transposon-mediated Nras knock-in induces hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic lipid accumulation in mice.</a></h1><p>Both Pten and Nras are downstream mediators of receptor  kinase activation that plays important roles in controlling cell survival and proliferation. Here, we investigated whether and how Pten loss cross-talks with Nras activation in driving liver cancer development in mice. Somatic disruption of hepatic Pten and overexpression of Nras were achieved in out-bred immunocompetent CD-1 mice through a hydrodynamic delivery of plasmids carrying Sleeping Beauty transposon-based integration of Nras and the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Pten knockout system. Concurrent Pten knockout and Nras knock-in induced hepatocellular carcinoma, while individual gene manipulation failed. Tumor development was associated with liver fibrosis, , hepatic deposition of lipid droplets and glycogen, and hepatomegaly. At the molecular level, lipid droplet formation was primarily contributed by upregulated expression of genes responsible for lipogenesis and fatty acid sequestration, such as Srebpf1, Acc, Pparg and its downstream targets. Our findings demonstrated that Pten disruption was synergized by Nras overexpression in driving hepatocyte malignant transformation, which correlated with extensive formation of lipid droplets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20133431>A high-fat diet increases risk of ventricular arrhythmia in female rats: enhanced arrhythmic risk in the absence of obesity or .</a></h1><p>Obesity increases the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias and impairs wound healing. However, it is presently unknown whether a high-fat diet affects arrhythmic risk or wound healing before the onset of overt obesity or . After 8 wk of feeding a high-fat diet to adult female rats, a nonsignificant increase in body weight was observed and associated with a normal plasma lipid profile. Following ischemia/reperfusion injury, scar length (standard diet 0.29 +/- 0.09 vs. high-fat 0.32 +/- 0.13 cm), thickness (standard diet 0.047 +/- 0.02 vs. high-fat 0.059 +/- 0.01 cm), and collagen alpha(1) type 1 content (standard diet 0.21 +/- 0.04 vs. high-fat 0.20 +/- 0.04 arbitrary units/mm(2)) of infarcted hearts were not altered by the high-fat diet. However, the mortality rate was greatly increased 24 h postinfarction (from 5% to 46%, P < 0.01 for ischemia/reperfusion rats; from 20% to 89%, P < 0.0001, in complete-occlusion rats) in high-fat fed rats, in association with a higher prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular arrhythmia inducibility was also significantly increased in noninfarcted rats fed a high-fat diet. In the hearts of rats fed a high-fat diet, connexin-40 expression was absent, connexin-43 was hypophosphorylated and lateralized, and neurofilament-M immunoreactive fiber density (standard diet 2,020 +/- 260 vs. high-fat diet 2,830 +/- 250 microm(2)/mm(2)) and  hydroxylase protein expression were increased (P < 0.05). Thus, in the absence of overt obesity and , sympathetic hyperinnervation and an aberrant pattern of gap junctional protein expression and regulation in the heart of female rats fed a high-fat diet may have contributed in part to the higher incidence of inducible cardiac arrhythmias.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28102743>Expression and alteration of BK channels in the sphincter of Oddi's from rabbits with hypercholesterolemia.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to investigate the expression and function of BK channels in the Sphincter of Oddi (SO) in a rabbit model of hypercholesterolemia (HC). New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into 2 groups: the control group was fed standard chow (n = 18) whereas the high-cholesterol group was fed cholesterol-enriched chow containing 1.5% cholesterol (n = 18). The serum cholesterol level was significantly greater in the HC groups than in the control group, but there was no significant difference in body weight between the control and HC groups. Although the total protein expression of BK α- and β-subunit was not significantly different between the control and HC groups, the Tyr-phosphorylation of BK α-subunit was significantly decreased in the HC group than in the control group. In addition, hypercholesterolemia significantly increased Acetylcholine (ACh)-induced contraction of the SO rings. Pretreatment with 30 μM NS1619, a BK channel agonist, significantly reduced ACh-induced contraction of the SO rings in HC rabbits. Moreover, pretreatment with 100 μM NaOV, a protein  phosphatase inhibitor, significantly reduced ACh-induced contraction of the SO rings in HC rabbits, whereas it significantly increased upon pretreating with 10 μM Genistein, a  kinase inhibitor. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings showed that BK current density was significantly lower in SOSMCs from HC group than that from control group. Our findings suggest that hypercholesterolemia-induced downregulation of BK channel, and Tyr-phosphorylation of BK α-subunit may contribute to the hyperresponsiveness of the SO ring in HC rabbits.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25447767>Genetic obesity alters recruitment of TANK-binding kinase 1 and AKT into hypothalamic lipid rafts domains.</a></h1><p>Lipid rafts (LRs) are membrane subdomains enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids and sphingolipids containing saturated fatty acid. Signaling proteins become concentrated in these microdomains mainly by saturated fatty acid modification, thus facilitating formation of protein complexes and activation of specific signaling pathways. High intake of saturated fatty acids promotes inflammation and insulin resistance, in part by disrupting insulin signaling pathway. Here we investigate whether lipid-induced toxicity in obesity correlates with altered composition of insulin signaling proteins in LRs in the brain. Our results showed that insulin receptor (IR) is highly concentrated in LRs fraction in comparison with soluble or postsynaptic density (PSD) fractions. Analysis of LRs domains from hippocampus of obese mouse showed a significant decrease of IR and its downstream signaling protein AKT, while in the PSD fraction we detected partial decrease of AKT and no changes in the IR concentration. No changes were shown in the soluble extract. In hypothalamus, genetic obesity also decreases interaction of AKT, but we did not detect changes in the IR distribution. However, in this structure genetic obesity increases recruitment of the IR negative regulator TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) into LRs and PSD fraction. No changes of AKT, IR and TBK1 were found in soluble fractions of obese in comparison with lean mice. In vitro studies showed that incubation with saturated palmitic acid but not with unsaturated docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or palmitoleic acid decreases association of IR and AKT and increases TBK1 recruitment into LRs and PSD domains, emulating what happens in the obese mice. TBK1 recruitment to insoluble domains correlates with decreases of IR  phosphorylation and ser473 AKT phosphorylation, markers of insulin resistance. These data support the hypothesis that  associated with genetic obesity alters targeting of TBK1 and insulin signaling proteins into insoluble LRs domains.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Rho-kinase-mediated Ca(2+) sensitization of vascular smooth muscle (VSM) plays a critical role in vasospasm and hypertension. We recently identified sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) and Src family  kinase (Src-TK) as upstream mediators for the Rho-kinase-mediated Ca(2+) sensitization. Here we report the strong linkage between cholesterol and the Ca(2+) sensitization of VSM mediated by a novel SPC/Src-TK/Rho-kinase pathway in both humans and rabbits. The extent of the sensitization correlated well with the total cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in serum. However, an inverse correlation with the serum level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was observed, and a correlation with other cardiovascular risk factors was nil. When cholesterol-lowering therapy was given to patients and rabbits with hypercholesterolemia, the SPC-induced contractions diminished. Depletion of VSM cholesterol by beta-cyclodextrin resulted in a loss of membrane caveolin-1, a marker of cholesterol-enriched lipid raft, and inhibited the SPC-induced Ca(2+) sensitization and translocation of Rho-kinase from cytosol to the cell membrane. Vasocontractions induced by membrane depolarization and by an adrenergic agonist were cholesterol-independent. Our data support the previously unreported concept that cholesterol potentiates the Ca(2+) sensitization of VSM mediated by a SPC/Src-TK/Rho-kinase pathway, and are also compatible with a role for cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomain, a lipid raft. This process may play an important role in the development of abnormal vascular contractions in patients with hypercholesterolemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21237289>Mechanism of attenuation of diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia induced vascular endothelial dysfunction by protein  phosphatase inhibition.</a></h1><p>The study has been designed to investigate downstream mechanisms in the PTPase inhibition mediated attenuation of diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction. Diabetes mellitus was induced in rats using streptozotocin (55 mg/kg, i.v. once), while hypercholesterolemia was produced by feeding high cholesterol diet. After 4 weeks of streptozotocin and Cholesterol rich diet administration, vascular endothelium dysfunction was assessed, in terms of attenuation of acetylcholine-induced, endothelium-dependent relaxation (Isolated Aortic Ring Preparation), a decrease in serum nitrate/nitrite level, as well as mRNA expression of eNOS (rtPCR) and disruption of integrity of vascular endothelium (Electron microscopy). After 14 days of daily administration, sodium orthovanadate (8 mg/kg, p.o., 16 mg/kg, p.o and 24 mg/kg, p.o) and atorvastatin (30 mg/kg, p.o) (positive control) significantly improved acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation, serum nitrate/nitrite level, mRNA expression of eNOS and maintained integrity of vascular endothelium. However, this ameliorative effect of SOV was significantly blocked by UCN-01, (PDK inhibitor) and L-NAME (Inhibitor of eNOS). Therefore, it may be concluded that sodium orthovanadate, a specific inhibitor of PTPase, may stimulate PDK and eNOS and consequently improve vascular endothelium dysfunction. Thus, inhibition of PTPase might be a useful approach in the therapeutics of vascular endothelium dysfunction.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Here our aim was to further clarify the mechanism of -induced nitrosative stress in a transgenic mouse model and to test if high cholesterol or high triglyceride is responsible for the -induced cardiac dysfunction.To determine the effect of cholesterol-enriched diet on cardiac performance and oxidative/nitrosative stress, wildtype and human apoB100 transgenic mice were fed a 2% cholesterol-enriched or a normal diet for 18 weeks. Serum cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly elevated only in the cholesterol-fed apoB100 transgenic mice, while serum triglycerides were increased in the transgenic mice fed a normal diet. Cholesterol-enriched diet significantly increased cardiac superoxide generation and NADPH oxidase expression and activity in apoB100 mice but not in wildtypes. Cardiac NO content and NO synthase activity did not change in either group. As assessed in isolated working hearts, aortic flow was significantly decreased only in apoB100 transgenic mice fed a cholesterol-enriched diet. The peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst FeTPPS attenuated the decrease in aortic flow in cholesterol-fed apoB100 mice. Immunohistochemistry showed elevated nitrotyrosine in the hearts of apoB100 mice fed the cholesterol-enriched diet.We conclude that hypercholesterolemia but not hypertriglyceridemia leads to increased formation of superoxide and peroxynitrite, and thereby results in cardiac dysfunction in hearts of human apoB100 transgenic mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14988255>Effect of postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia on circulating adhesion molecules and oxidative stress generation and the possible role of simvastatin treatment.</a></h1><p>Adhesion molecules, particularly intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, and E-selectin, have been associated with cardiovascular disease. Elevated levels of these molecules have been reported in diabetic patients. Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia are considered risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and evidence suggests that postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia may induce an increase in circulating adhesion molecules. However, the distinct role of these two factors is a matter of debate. Thirty type 2 diabetic patients and 20 normal subjects ate three different meals: a high-fat meal, 75 g of glucose alone, and a high-fat meal plus glucose. Glycemia, triglyceridemia, plasma nitrotyrosine, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin were assayed during the tests. Subsequently, diabetic subjects took simvastatin 40 mg/day or placebo for 12 weeks. The three tests were performed again at baseline, between 3 and 6 days after starting the study, and at the end of each study. High-fat load and glucose alone produced an increase of nitrotyrosine, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin plasma levels in normal and diabetic subjects. These effects were more pronounced when high fat and glucose were combined. Short-term simvastatin treatment had no effect on lipid parameters, but reduced the effect on adhesion molecules and nitrotyrosine, which was observed during every different test. Long-term simvastatin treatment was accompanied by a lower increase in postprandial triglycerides, which was followed by smaller variations in ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, and nitrotyrosine during the tests. This study shows an independent and cumulative effect of postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia on ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin plasma levels, suggesting oxidative stress as a common mediator of such effects. Simvastatin shows a beneficial effect on oxidative stress and the plasma levels of adhesion molecules, which may be ascribed to a direct effect in addition to the lipid-lowering action of the drug.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22474254>Myeloid-specific Krüppel-like factor 2 inactivation increases macrophage and neutrophil adhesion and promotes atherosclerosis.</a></h1><p>Hemizygous deficiency of the transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) has been shown previously to augment atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic mice. However, the cell type responsible for the increased atherosclerosis due to KLF2 deficiency has not been identified. This study examined the consequence of myeloid cell-specific KLF2 inactivation in atherosclerosis.Cell-specific knockout mice were generated by Cre/loxP recombination. Macrophages isolated from myeloid-specific Klf2 knockout (myeKlf2(-/-)) mice were similar to myeKlf2(+/+) macrophages in response to activation, polarization, and lipid accumulation. However, in comparison to myeKlf2(+/+) macrophages, myeKlf2(-/-) macrophages adhered more robustly to endothelial cells. Neutrophils from myeKlf2(-/-) mice also adhered more robustly to endothelial cells, and fewer myeKlf2(-/-) neutrophils survived in culture over a 24-hour period in comparison with myeKlf2(+/+) neutrophils. When myeKlf2(-/-) mice were mated to Ldlr(-/-) mice and then fed a high fat and high cholesterol diet, significant increase in atherosclerosis was observed in the myeKlf2(-/-)Ldlr(-/-) mice compared with myeKlf2(+/+)Ldlr(-/-) littermates. The increased atherosclerosis in myeKlf2(-/-)Ldlr(-/-) mice was associated with elevated presence of neutrophils and macrophages, with corresponding increase of myeloperoxidase as well as chlorinated and nitrosylated  epitopes in their lesion areas compared with myeKlf2(+/+)Ldlr(-/-) mice.This study documents a role for myeloid KLF2 expression in modulating atherosclerosis. The increased neutrophil accumulation and atherosclerosis progression with myeloid-specific KLF2 deficiency also underscores the importance of neutrophils in promoting vascular oxidative stress and atherosclerosis. Collectively, these results suggest that elevating KLF2 expression may be a novel strategy for prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17326204>Impairment of hepatic Stat-3 activation and reduction of PPARalpha activity in fructose-fed rats.</a></h1><p>Fructose makes up a significant proportion of energy intake in westernized diets; its increased consumption has paralleled the growing prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome over the past two decades. In the current study, we demonstrate that fructose administration (10% wt/vol) in the drinking water of rats reduces the trans-activating and trans-repressing activity of the hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). As a consequence, fructose decreases hepatic fatty oxidation and increases pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity. These changes were not observed in glucose-administered rats (10% wt/vol), although both carbohydrates produced similar changes in plasma adiponectin and in the hepatic expression of transcription factors and enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis. Fructose-fed, but not glucose-fed, rats were hyperleptinemic and exhibited increased  phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) transcription factor, although they did not present a similar increase in the serine phosphorylation of nuclear STAT3. Thus, an impairment in the hepatic transduction of the leptin signal could be responsible for the observed alterations in PPARalpha activity in fructose-fed rats. Because PPARalpha activity is lower in human than in rodent liver, fructose ingestion in humans should cause even worse effects, which would partly explain the link between increased consumption of fructose and widening epidemics of obesity and metabolic syndrome.Hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis induced by fructose ingestion result from a reduction in the hepatic catabolism of fatty acids driven by a state of leptin resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17420349>Lack of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase-1 accelerates atherosclerosis in diabetic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice.</a></h1><p>Recent clinical studies have suggested a major protective role for the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx1) in diabetes-associated atherosclerosis. We induced diabetes in mice deficient for both GPx1 and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) to determine whether this is merely an association or whether GPx1 has a direct effect on diabetes-associated atherosclerosis.ApoE-deficient (ApoE-/-) and ApoE/GPx1 double-knockout (ApoE-/- GPx1-/-) mice were made diabetic with streptozotocin and aortic lesion formation, and atherogenic pathways were assessed after 10 and 20 weeks of diabetes. Aortic proinflammatory and profibrotic markers were determined by both quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis after 10 weeks of diabetes and immunohistochemical analysis after 10 and 20 weeks of diabetes. Sham-injected nondiabetic counterparts served as controls. Atherosclerotic lesions within the aortic sinus region, as well as arch, thoracic, and abdominal lesions, were significantly increased in diabetic ApoE-/- GPx1-/- aortas compared with diabetic ApoE-/- aortas. This increase was accompanied by increased macrophages, alpha-smooth muscle actin, receptors for advanced glycation end products, and various proinflammatory (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) and profibrotic (vascular endothelial growth factor and connective tissue growth factor) markers. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis showed increased expression of receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, vascular endothelial growth factor, and connective tissue growth factor. Nitrotyrosine levels were significantly increased in diabetic ApoE-/- GPx1-/- mouse aortas. These findings were observed despite upregulation of other antioxidants.Lack of functional GPx1 accelerates diabetes-associated atherosclerosis via upregulation of proinflammatory and profibrotic pathways in ApoE-/- mice. Our study provides evidence of a protective role for GPx1 and establishes GPx1 as an important antiatherogenic therapeutic target in patients with or at risk of diabetic macrovascular disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11854126>Cigarette smoke exposure and hypercholesterolemia increase mitochondrial damage in cardiovascular tissues.</a></h1><p>A shared feature among cardiovascular disease risk factors is increased oxidative stress. Because mitochondria are susceptible to damage mediated by oxidative stress, we hypothesized that risk factors (secondhand smoke and hypercholesterolemia) are associated with increased mitochondrial damage in cardiovascular tissues.Atherosclerotic lesion formation, mitochondrial DNA damage, protein nitration, and specific activities of mitochondrial proteins in cardiovascular tissues from age-matched C57 and apoE(-/-) mice exposed to filtered air or secondhand smoke were quantified. Both secondhand smoke and hypercholesterolemia were associated with significantly increased mitochondrial DNA damage and protein nitration. Tobacco smoke exposure also resulted in significantly decreased specific activities of mitochondrial enzymes. The combination of secondhand smoke and hypercholesterolemia resulted in increased atherosclerotic lesion formation and even greater levels of mitochondrial damage.These data are consistent with the hypothesis that cardiovascular disease risk factors cause mitochondrial damage and dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14769706>Oral imatinib mesylate (STI571/gleevec) improves the efficacy of local intravascular vascular endothelial growth factor-C gene transfer in reducing neointimal growth in hypercholesterolemic rabbits.</a></h1><p>Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) antagonists have demonstrated beneficial effects on neointima formation, but in studies using PDGF inhibitors and extended follow-up, the lesions reoccur. These findings implicate a need to combine targeting of PDGF with other strategies. Stimulation of reendothelialization by treatment with endothelial cell mitogens of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family counteracts restenosis, but there are also concerns regarding the durability of the effect with this approach.To explore whether a combined use of PDGF antagonist and stimulation of reendothelialization confers better results than each therapy alone, we combined systemic administration of imatinib mesylate (STI571/Gleevec, 10 mg/kg(-1) per d(-1)), a  kinase inhibitor with activity against PDGF receptors, with local intravascular adenovirus-mediated VEGF-C gene transfer (1.15x10(10) pfu) in cholesterol-fed, balloon-injured rabbits. Throughout the course of the STI571 therapy, the circulating concentrations were able to suppress PDGF receptor phosphorylation. At 3 weeks, the treatment with STI571 led to a transient decrease in intralesion macrophages and to an increase in intimal smooth muscle cell apoptosis. VEGF-C application reduced neointima formation and accelerated reendothelialization. However, none of the therapies alone reduced intimal thickening at a 6-week time point, whereas the combined treatment led to a persistent reduction (55% versus control) in lesion size at this time point.Our study provides one of the first successful examples of gene therapy combined with a pharmacological treatment to modulate 2 distinct ligand-receptor signaling systems and suggests combination of local VEGF-C gene therapy with systemic inhibition of PDGF signaling as a novel principle to prevent intimal hyperplasia after vascular manipulations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16959274>Corosolic acid prevents oxidative stress, inflammation and hypertension in SHR/NDmcr-cp rats, a model of metabolic syndrome.</a></h1><p>Corosolic acid (CRA), a constituent of banaba leaves, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory and hypoglycemic activities. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of CRA on metabolic risk factors including obesity, hypertension, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and  together with oxidative stress and inflammation, all of which are characteristic of the SHR/NDmcr-cp (cp/cp) (SHR-cp) rat, an animal model of metabolic syndrome. Six-week-old male SHR-cp rats were fed a high fat diet containing 0.072% CRA for 14 weeks. Treatment with CRA lowered blood pressure, which was elevated in control animals, by 10% after 8 weeks, and serum free fatty acids by 21% after 2 weeks. CRA treatment resulted in decreases in the levels of the oxidative stress markers thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine by 27% and 59%, respectively, after 2 weeks. CRA treatment also reduced the levels of myeloperoxidase markers, 3-nitrotyrosine and 3-chlorotyrosine by 38% and 39%, respectively, after 10 weeks, and tended to decrease the levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation, after 6 weeks. However, CRA had no effect on weight gain or hyperglycemia. These results demonstrate that CRA can ameliorate hypertension, abnormal lipid metabolism, and oxidative stress as well as the inflammatory state in SHR-cp rats.

Only a little more than four decades ago trivalent chromium has been known as an essential element with relation to glycide and lipid metabolism. And only during several last years this chromium function has been revealed on a molecular level. After absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, chromium is most likely transported to cells bound to the plasma protein transferrin. Insulin initiates chromium transport into the cells where it is bound to the oligopeptide apochromodulin. This oligopeptide combined with four chromium(III) atoms forms chromodulin, which is important for amplifying the insulin signalling effect. After binding to insulin-activated receptor, chromodulin increases  kinase activity by one order. This enzyme forms a part of intracellular portion of insulin receptor. Chromium supplementation in people with chromium deficiency can improve glucose tolerance and some lipid metabolism parameters. The supplementation is indicated in persons with impaired glucose tolerance both in preclinical and manifested stadium of type 2 diabetes mellitus where increased lost of chromium in urine was documented. In these patients, chromium deficiency can participate in insulin resistance and . Chromium is usually applied in the form of organic compounds: yeast extract or chromium(III) picolinate. Cr(III) picolinate can be reduced to compounds of Cr(II) in the cells which can then produce free hydroxyl radical in the so called Fenton reaction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25220639>Metabolomic analysis of simvastatin and fenofibrate intervention in high-lipid diet-induced  rats.</a></h1><p>To investigate the metabolite changes caused by simvastatin or fenofibrate intervention in diet-induced  rats using a GC-MS-based metabolomic profiling approach.SD rats were fed with high-lipid diet for 4 weeks to induce , then the rats were fed with normal diet, and orally administered with simvastatin (10 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1)) or fenofibrate (150 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1)) for 2 weeks. Blood samples were collected once a week, and potential biomarkers were examined using commercial assay kits and a metabolomic approach. The metabolomics data were analyzed using a multivariate statistical technique and a principal component analysis (PCA).Oral administration of simvastatin or fenofibrate significantly decreased the plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and increased the plasma level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in the  rats. Plasma samples were scattered in the PCA scores plots in response to the diet and to the drugs administered. The main metabolites changed in the  rats were cholesterol, creatinine, linoleic acid, β-hydroxybutyric acid, , isoleucine and ornithine. The plasma level of creatinine was significantly lower in the simvastatin-treated rats than in the fenofibrate-treated rats. The plasma  concentration was declined following intake of high-lipid diet, which was reversed by fenobrate, but not by simvastatin.A series of potential biomarkers including , creatinine, linoleic acid, β-hydroxybutyric acid and ornithine have been identified by metabolomic profiling, which may be used to identify the metabolic changes during  progression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28160259>Protein malnutrition during fetal programming induces fatty liver in adult male offspring rats.</a></h1><p>We evaluated the effects of protein malnutrition on liver morphology and physiology in rats subjected to different malnutrition schemes. Pregnant rats were fed with a control diet or a low protein diet (LPD). Male offspring rats received a LPD during gestation, lactation, and until they were 60 days old (MM group), a late LPD that began after weaning (CM), or a LPD administrated only during the gestation-lactation period followed by a control diet (MC). On day 60, blood was collected and the liver was dissected out. We found a decrease in MM rats' total body (p < 0.001) and liver (p < 0.05) weight. These and CM rats showed obvious liver dysfunction reflected by the increase in serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGOT) (MM p < 0.001) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) (MM and CM p < 0.001) enzymes, and liver content of cholesterol (MM and CM p < 0.001) and triglycerides (MM p < 0.01; CM p < 0.001), in addition to what we saw by histology. Liver dysfunction was also shown by the increase in gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) (MM, MC, and CM p < 0.001) and GST-pi1 (MM and CM p < 0.001, MC p < 0.05) expression levels. MC rats showed the lowest increment in GST-pi1 expression (MC vs. MM; p < 0.001, MC vs. CM; p < 0.01). ROS production (MM, CM, and MC: p < 0.001), lipid peroxidation (MM, CM, and MC p < 0.001), content of carbonyl groups in liver proteins (MM and CM p < 0.001, MC p < 0.01), and total antioxidant capacity (MM, CM, and MC p < 0.001) were increased in the liver of all groups of malnourished animals. However, MM rats showed the highest increment. We found higher TNF-α (MM and CM p < 0.001), and IL-6 (MM and CM p < 0.001) serum levels and TGF-β liver content (MM p < 0.01; CM p < 0.05), in MM and CM groups, while MC rats reverted the values to normal levels. Pro-survival signaling pathways mediated by  or serine/threonine kinases (pAKT) (MM and CM p < 0.001; MC p < 0.01) and extrasellular signal-regulated kinase (pERKs) (MM p < 0.01; CM p < 0.05) appeared to be activated in the liver of all groups of malnourished rats, suggesting the presence of cells resistant to apoptosis which would become cancerous. In conclusion, a LPD induced liver damage whose magnitude was related to the developmental stage at which malnutrition occurs and to its length.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30226559>Treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus via reversing insulin resistance and regulating lipid homeostasis in vitro and in vivo using cajanonic acid A.</a></h1><p>The present study investigated the effects of cajanonic acid A (CAA), extracted from the leaves of Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp with a purity of 98.22%, on the regulatory mechanisms of glucose and lipid metabolism. HepG2 cells transfected with a protein‑ phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) overexpression plasmid were established. The cells, induced with insulin resistance by dexamethasone (Dex) treatment, together with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) model rats and ob/ob mice, were used in the present study. The effects of CAA treatment on the differentiation of 3T3‑L1 adipocytes were determined using Oil Red O. The expression levels of insulin signaling factors were detected via reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. The results revealed that the overexpression of PTP1B contributed to insulin resistance, which was reversed by CAA treatment via inhibiting the activity of PTP1B and by regulating the expression of associated insulin signaling factors. The treatment of cell lines with Dex led to increased expression of PTP1B but decreased glucose consumption, and decreased  phosphorylation of insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1, and phosphoinositide 3‑kinase. Treatment with CAA not only reduced the fasting blood glucose levels and protected organs from damage, but also reduced the serum fasting levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and low‑density lipoprotein cholesterol in the T2DM rats. CAA treatment also inhibited adipocyte differentiation and decreased the mRNA levels of various adipogenic genes. Furthermore, CAA treatment restored the transduction of insulin signaling by regulating the expression of PTP1B and associated insulin signaling factors. Treatment with CAA also reduced the problems associated with hyperglycemia and . In conclusion, CAA may be used to cure T2DM via restoring insulin resistance and preventing obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27193034>PPAR-α, a lipid-sensing transcription factor, regulates blood-brain barrier efflux transporter expression.</a></h1><p>Lipid sensor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR- α) is the master regulator of lipid metabolism. Dietary release of endogenous free fatty acids, fibrates, and certain persistent environmental pollutants, e.g. perfluoroalkyl fire-fighting foam components, are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha ligands. Here, we define a role for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha in regulating the expression of three ATP-driven drug efflux transporters at the rat and mouse blood-brain barriers: P-glycoprotein (Abcb1), breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp/Abcg2), and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2/Abcc2). Exposing isolated rat brain capillaries to linoleic acid, clofibrate, or PKAs increased the transport activity and protein expression of the three ABC transporters. These effects were blocked by the PPAR- α antagonist, GW6471. Dosing rats with 20 mg/kg or 200 mg/kg of clofibrate decreased the brain accumulation of the P-glycoprotein substrate, verapamil, by 50% (in situ brain perfusion; effects blocked by GW6471) and increased P-glycoprotein expression and activity in capillaries ex vivo. Fasting C57Bl/6 wild-type mice for 24 h increased both serum lipids and brain capillary P-glycoprotein transport activity. Fasting did not alter P-glycoprotein activity in PPAR- α knockout mice. These results indicate that , lipid-lowering fibrates and exposure to certain fire-fighting foam components activate blood-brain barrier peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, increase drug efflux transporter expression and reduce drug delivery to the brain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17379842>Fluvastatin alters platelet aggregability in patients with hypercholesterolemia: possible improvement of intraplatelet redox imbalance via HMG-CoA reductase.</a></h1><p>Hypercholesterolemia enhances platelet aggregability. Statins have beneficial effects on cardiovascular events. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether statins inhibit platelet aggregation and, if so, the mechanisms.Twelve patients with hypercholesterolemia were prospectively randomized in a crossover design to receive either fluvastatin (20 mg/d) or colestimide (3000 mg/d) for 12 weeks. The subjects were switched to the opposite arm for additional 12 weeks. Before and after first and second treatments, experiments were performed. Eleven age-matched volunteers with normal lipid profiles served as controls. ADP-induced platelet aggregation, platelet-derive nitric oxide (PDNO) release, intraplatelet levels of GSH and GSSG, and intraplatelet nitrotyrosine production during platelet aggregation were measured. Fluvastatin and colestimide equally lowered total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemia. Platelet aggregation was greater in hypercholesterolemia than in normocholesterolemia before treatment and was altered by fluvastatin. PDNO release, intraplatelet glutathione level, and GSH/GSSG ratio were lower in hypercholesterolemia than in normocholesterolemia before treatment and were increased by fluvastatin. Intraplatelet nitrotyrosine formation was greater in hypercholesterolemia than in normocholesterolemia, and decreased by fluvastatin. Colestimide did not have such effects. In vitro application of fluvastatin dose-dependently inhibited platelet aggregation. Furthermore, in vitro application of fluvastatin dose-dependently inhibited platelet nitrotyrosine expressions and the inhibitory effects by fluvastatin were reversed by preincubation with geranylgeranylpyrophosphate.Fluvastatin altered platelet aggregability in hypercholesterolemic patients in a cholesterol-lowering independent manner, which was partly mediated by the improvement of intraplatelet redox imbalance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12039802>Antioxidant improves smooth muscle sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase function and lowers  nitration in hypercholesterolemia and improves nitric oxide-induced relaxation.</a></h1><p>Antioxidants improve endothelial function in hypercholesterolemia (HC); however, whether this includes improvement of the vascular smooth muscle response to NO is unknown. NO relaxes arteries, in part, by stimulating Ca(2+) uptake via sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in aortic smooth muscle, and HC impairs SERCA function and the response to NO. HC induces oxidative stress, which could impair SERCA function. To study the effect of antioxidants, which are known to improve endothelium-dependent relaxation in HC, smooth muscle SERCA activity and NO-induced relaxation were studied in rabbits fed normal chow or a 0.5% cholesterol diet for 13 weeks. The antioxidant t-butylhydroxytoluene (BHT, 1%) was mixed with the HC diet in the last 3 weeks. HC impaired acetylcholine- and NO-induced relaxation, and these were restored by BHT. After inhibiting SERCA with thapsigargin, no difference existed in NO-induced relaxation among the three groups. Reduced aortic SERCA activity in HC was restored by BHT without changing SERCA protein expression. 3-Nitrotyrosine was notably increased in the media of the HC aorta, where it colocalized with SERCA. -nitrated SERCA protein was immunoprecipitated in the aortas of HC rabbits, where it was decreased by BHT, and it was also detected in the aortas of atherosclerotic humans. Thus, the antioxidant reverses impaired smooth muscle SERCA function in HC, and this is correlated with the improved relaxation to NO. These beneficial effects may depend on reducing the direct effects on SERCA of reactive oxygen species that are augmented in HC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15734664>Statins, cholesterol, Co-enzyme Q10, and Parkinson's disease.</a></h1><p>'Statins', drugs that lower cholesterol are widely used. Statins block cholesterol in the body and brain by inhibiting HMG-Co-A reductase. This pathway is shared by CoQ-10. An unintended consequence of the statins is lowering of CoQ-10. As CoQ-10 may play a role in PD, its possible statins may worsen PD. Such a report has appeared. Statins came into wide use in 1997-1998, 6 years before our study began. Thus 74% of our patients on a statin had a PD duration of 1-6 years versus 56% of our patients not on a statin. A direct comparison of patients on a statin and not on a statin would bias the study in favor of the statins: patients on a statin would have a shorter disease duration and less advanced PD. Therefore we divided the patients into two groups. Group I consisted of 128 patients on a statin, and 252 not on a statin who had PD for 1-6 years. In this group, disease severity (Hoehn & Yahr Stage), levodopa dose, Co-enzyme Q10 use, prevalence of 'wearing off', dyskinesia and dementia were similar. Group II consisted of 45 patients on a statin and 200 patients not on a statin who had PD for 7-22 years. In this group disease severity, levodopa dose, Co-enzyme Q10 use, prevalence of wearing off, dyskinesia and dementia were similar. Statins although they may affect Co-enzyme Q10 levels in the body and the brain, do not worsen PD at least as assessed by stage, and prevalence of wearing-off, dyskinesia, and dementia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20823099>Antiatherosclerotic and renoprotective effects of ebselen in the diabetic apolipoprotein E/GPx1-double knockout mouse.</a></h1><p>To investigate the effect of the GPx1-mimetic ebselen on diabetes-associated atherosclerosis and renal injury in a model of increased oxidative stress.The study was performed using diabetic apolipoprotein E/GPx1 (ApoE(-/-)GPx1(-/-))-double knockout (dKO) mice, a model combining  and hyperglycemia with increased oxidative stress. Mice were randomized into two groups, one injected with streptozotocin, the other with vehicle, at 8 weeks of age. Groups were further randomized to receive either ebselen or no treatment for 20 weeks.Ebselen reduced diabetes-associated atherosclerosis in most aortic regions, with the exception of the aortic sinus, and protected dKO mice from renal structural and functional injury. The protective effects of ebselen were associated with a reduction in oxidative stress (hydroperoxides in plasma, 8-isoprostane in urine, nitrotyrosine in the kidney, and 4-hydroxynonenal in the aorta) as well as a reduction in VEGF, CTGF, VCAM-1, MCP-1, and Nox2 after 10 weeks of diabetes in the dKO aorta. Ebselen also significantly reduced the expression of proteins implicated in fibrosis and inflammation in the kidney as well as reducing related key intracellular signaling pathways.Ebselen has an antiatherosclerotic and renoprotective effect in a model of accelerated diabetic complications in the setting of enhanced oxidative stress. Our data suggest that ebselen effectively repletes the lack of GPx1, and indicate that ebselen may be an effective therapeutic for the treatment of diabetes-related atherosclerosis and nephropathy. Furthermore, this study highlights the feasibility of addressing two diabetic complications with one treatment regimen through the unifying approach of targeted antioxidant therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27455246>Mutant LRP6 Impairs Endothelial Cell Functions Associated with Familial Normolipidemic Coronary Artery Disease.</a></h1><p>Mutations in the genes low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein-6 (LRP6) and myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) were reported in families with coronary artery disease (CAD). We intend to determine the mutational spectrum of these genes among hyperlipidemic and normolipidemic CAD families. Forty probands with early-onset CAD were recruited from 19 hyperlipidemic and 21 normolipidemic Chinese families. We sequenced all exons and intron-exon boundaries of LRP6 and MEF2A, and found a novel heterozygous variant in LRP6 from a proband with normolipidemic CAD. This variant led to a substitution of histidine to  (Y418H) in an evolutionarily conserved domain YWTD in exon 6 and was not found in 1025 unrelated healthy individuals. Co-segregated with CAD in the affected family, LRP6Y418H significantly debilitated the Wnt3a-associated signaling pathway, suppressed endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and decreased anti-apoptotic ability. However, it exhibited no influences on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol uptake. Thus, mutation Y418H in LRP6 likely contributes to normolipidemic familial CAD via impairing endothelial cell functions and weakening the Wnt3a signaling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20353144>Diabetes mellitus: diagnosis and screening.</a></h1><p>Based on etiology, diabetes is classified as type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, latent autoimmune diabetes, maturity-onset diabetes of youth, and miscellaneous causes.

Although there are conflicting guidelines, most agree that patients with hypertension or  should be screened for diabetes. Diabetes risk calculators have a high negative predictive value and help define patients who are unlikely to have diabetes. Tests that may help establish the type of diabetes or the continued need for insulin include those reflective of beta cell function, such as C peptide levels, and markers of immune-mediated beta cell destruction (e.g., autoantibodies to islet cells, insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase,  phosphatase [IA-2a and IA-2beta]).

The purpose of this experiment was to determine a mechanism for adhesion reduction.Twenty-seven male Yorkshire swine were fed a high-cholesterol diet to simulate conditions of coronary artery disease followed by the surgical placement of an ameroid constrictor to the left circumflex coronary artery to induce chronic ischaemia. Postoperatively, control pigs continued their high-fat/cholesterol diet alone, whereas the two experimental groups had diets supplemented with either red wine or vodka for 7 weeks followed by reoperative sternotomy and cardiac harvest.The expression of related adhesion focal  kinase (RAFTK) and caspase 3 in the sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-soluble myocardial fraction was significantly higher only in the vodka-supplemented group. In the more soluble fraction, the expression of caspase 3, cleaved caspase 3 and caspase 9 was lower in both the vodka and red wine treatment groups.In the SDS-soluble lysate fraction, likely representing the transmembrane/cell-extracellular matrix (ECM), a significant increase in RAFTK and caspase 3 expression was seen only in the vodka-treated animals, which may explain why this group demonstrated significantly fewer pericardial adhesions. Caspase expression/signalling was not increased in the more soluble myocardial lysate, suggesting that the increased apoptotic signalling was specific to the epicardial-ECM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12190111>Activation of Raf-1/MEK-1/2/p42/44(MAPK) cascade alone is sufficient to uncouple LDL receptor expression from cell growth.</a></h1><p>Our previous observation that induction of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor expression by a variety of extracellular signals is blocked by PD98059, a specific mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor, led to the suggestion that the growth-responsive p42/44(MAPK) cascade plays a critical role in regulating LDL receptor transcription. To analyze the specific contribution of the p42/44(MAPK) cascade in regulating cell growth and LDL receptor induction, we established a HepG2-derived cell line that stably expresses an inducible form of oncogenic human Raf-1 kinase. Using this system, we provide direct evidence that specific activation of this cascade alone is not only required but is sufficient to fully induce LDL receptor expression. Interestingly, degree of p42/44(MAPK) activation determines the extent of LDL receptor induction. However, activation of p42/44(MAPK) in the above cells led to the inhibition of DNA synthesis, caused growth arrest, decrease in cyclin A and upregulation of p21(Cip) expression in a time-dependent manner. These results suggest that each of these two processes can be regulated independently of each other in response to p42/44(MAPK) activation. Thus, extent of p42/44(MAPK) activation may be important in transducing divergent cellular responses in human cells with implications for altered signaling resulting in hypercholesterolemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18482975>SIRT1 regulates hepatocyte lipid metabolism through activating AMP-activated protein kinase.</a></h1><p>Resveratrol may protect against metabolic disease through activating SIRT1 deacetylase. Because we have recently defined AMPK activation as a key mechanism for the beneficial effects of polyphenols on hepatic lipid accumulation, , and atherosclerosis in type 1 diabetic mice, we hypothesize that polyphenol-activated SIRT1 acts upstream of AMPK signaling and hepatocellular lipid metabolism. Here we show that polyphenols, including resveratrol and the synthetic polyphenol S17834, increase SIRT1 deacetylase activity, LKB1 phosphorylation at Ser(428), and AMPK activity. Polyphenols substantially prevent the impairment in phosphorylation of AMPK and its downstream target, ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase), elevation in expression of FAS (fatty acid synthase), and lipid accumulation in human HepG2 hepatocytes exposed to high glucose. These effects of polyphenols are largely abolished by pharmacological and genetic inhibition of SIRT1, suggesting that the stimulation of AMPK and lipid-lowering effect of polyphenols depend on SIRT1 activity. Furthermore, adenoviral overexpression of SIRT1 stimulates the basal AMPK signaling in HepG2 cells and in the mouse liver. AMPK activation by SIRT1 also protects against FAS induction and lipid accumulation caused by high glucose. Moreover, LKB1, but not CaMKKbeta, is required for activation of AMPK by polyphenols and SIRT1. These findings suggest that SIRT1 functions as a novel upstream regulator for LKB1/AMPK signaling and plays an essential role in the regulation of hepatocyte lipid metabolism. Targeting SIRT1/LKB1/AMPK signaling by polyphenols may have potential therapeutic implications for dyslipidemia and accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetes and age-related diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20582430>Tremor following ischemic stroke of the posterior thalamus.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19715756>Lipoprotein lipase is nitrated in vivo after lipopolysaccharide challenge.</a></h1><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration down-regulates lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity at the posttranscriptional level. Hypertriglyceridemia is the main metabolic consequence of this fall in LPL activity and is presumably involved in the innate immune response to infection. Nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in LPS-induced down-regulation of LPL activity, but whether its effects are direct or indirect remains unclear. Here we examined the potential nitration of LPL in vivo in response to LPS challenge in rats. We found hypertriglyceridemia, iNOS expression, NO overproduction, and a generalized decrease in LPL activity in tissues 6 h after LPS administration. LPL sensitivity to nitration was first explored by in vitro exposure of bovine LPL to peroxynitrite, a reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Nitration was confirmed by anti-nitrotyrosine Western blot and subsequent identification of specific nitrotyrosine-containing LPL sequences by tandem mass spectrometry. Further analysis by targeted mass spectrometry revealed three in vivo-nitrated  residues in heart LPL from LPS-challenged rats. This is the first study to identify nitrated  residues in LPL, both in vitro and in vivo, and it demonstrates that LPL is a target for RNS in endotoxemia. These results indicate that LPL nitration may be a new mechanism of LPL activity regulation in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29514830>Progenitor Cells and Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes.</a></h1><p>Circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) mobilize in response to ischemic injury, but their predictive value remains unknown in acute coronary syndrome (ACS).We aimed to investigate the number of CPCs in ACS compared with those with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), relationship between bone marrow PCs and CPCs, and whether CPC counts predict mortality in patients with ACS.In 2028 patients, 346 had unstable angina, 183 had an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and the remaining 1499 patients had stable CAD. Patients with ACS were followed for the primary end point of all-cause death. CPCs were enumerated by flow cytometry as mononuclear cells expressing a combination of CD34+, CD133+, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2+, or chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4+. CPC counts were higher in subjects with AMI compared those with stable CAD even after adjustment for age, sex, race, body mass index, renal function, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, , and smoking; CD34+, CD34+/CD133+, CD34+/CXCR4+, and CD34+/VEGFR2+ CPC counts were 19%, 25%, 28%, and 142% higher in those with AMI, respectively, compared with stable CAD. There were strong correlations between the concentrations of CPCs and the PC counts in bone marrow aspirates in 20 patients with AMI. During a 2 (interquartile range, 1.31-2.86)-year follow-up period of 529 patients with ACS, 12.4% died. In Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, heart failure history, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and AMI, subjects with low CD34+ cell counts had a 2.46-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.18-5.13) increase in all-cause mortality, =0.01. CD34+/CD133+ and CD34+/CXCR4+, but not CD34+/VEGFR2+ PC counts, had similar associations with mortality. Results were validated in a separate cohort of 238 patients with ACS.CPC levels are significantly higher in patients after an AMI compared with those with stable CAD and reflect bone marrow PC content. Among patients with ACS, a lower number of hematopoietic-enriched CPCs are associated with a higher mortality.© 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25247699>Effect of flaxseed on choroid-sclera complex thickness and on LDL oxidation in the sclera, choroid and retina of diet-induced hypercholesterolaemic rabbits.</a></h1><p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of flaxseed on choroid-sclera complex thickness and on LDL oxidation in the sclera, choroid and retina of diet-induced hypercholesterolaemic rabbits. New Zealand male albino rabbits (n 21) were divided into two groups: group 1 (G1; n 11), fed a hypercholesterolaemic diet, and group 2 (G2; n 10), fed a hypercholesterolaemic diet enriched with flaxseed flour. The serum concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-cholesterol, TAG and fasting blood glucose were determined at the start of the experiment and on the day of killing (8th week). Choroid and sclera samples were subjected to haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and histomorphometric and immunohistochemical analyses with the anti-oxidised LDL antibody. Sensory retina samples were subjected to an immunohistochemical analysis with the primary monoclonal nitrotyrosine antibody. At the end of the experiment, a significant increase was observed in TC and LDL-C concentrations in G1 rabbits when compared with G2 rabbits (P= 0·008 and P= 0·02, respectively).

An evidence exists that PTK2B is involved in cell growth, vascular contraction, inflammatory responses, and salt and water retention through activation of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor. To examine the contribution of PTK2B, we sequenced the PTK2B gene using 48 patients with hypertension, identified 62 genetic polymorphisms, and genotyped six representative single nucleotide polymorphisms in population-based case-control samples from 3655 Japanese individuals (1520 patients with hypertension and 2135 controls). Multivariate logistic regression analysis after adjustments for age, body mass index, present illness ( and diabetes mellitus), and lifestyle (smoking and drinking) showed -22A>G to have an association with hypertension in men (AA vs. AG+GG: odds ratio=1.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.57; P=0.030). Another polymorphism, 53484A>C (K838T), in linkage disequilibrium with -22A>G showed a marginal association with hypertension in men (AA vs. AC+CC: odds ratio=1.25; 95% confidence interval: 0.99-1.57; P=0.059). Diastolic blood pressure was 1.6 mmHg higher in men with the AC+CC genotype of 53484A>C than those with the AA genotype (P=0.003), after adjustments for the same factors. These polymorphisms are in linkage disequilibrium with others in a range of 113 kb in PTK2B. The intracellular distribution of the recombinant PTK2B protein and that of the mutant protein with T838 were indistinguishable even after angiotensin II stimulation, both proteins localizing at a focal point in the peripheral area in the cells. Thus, a haplotype in PTK2B may play a role in essential hypertension in Japanese.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19734363>Cholesterol diet-induced  impairs the cardioprotective effect of postconditioning: role of peroxynitrite.</a></h1><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate if  interferes with the infarct size-limiting effect of postconditioning and to study the involvement of peroxynitrite in this phenomenon. Rats were fed a 2% cholesterol-enriched or normal diet for 12 wk. Infarct size by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining was measured in hearts isolated from both groups and subjected to 30 min coronary occlusion followed by 120 min reperfusion with or without the postconditioning protocol induced by six cycles of 10 s coronary occlusion and 10 s reperfusion at the onset of the reperfusion. Postconditioning significantly decreased infarct size in the normolipidemic but not in the hyperlipidemic group. Postconditioning increased cardiac 3-nitrotyrosine concentration (a marker for peroxynitrite formation) in the normal but not in the cholesterol-fed group when measured at the 5th min of reperfusion. Next, we tested if the postconditioning-induced acute increase in peroxynitrite is involved in the cardioprotection in normolipidemic animals in separate experiments. Postconditioning failed to decrease infarct size in the presence of the peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst 5,10,15,20-tetrakis-[4-sulfonatophenyl]-porphyrinato-iron [III] (20 mg/l) in normolipidemic animals. We conclude that an early increase in peroxynitrite after postconditioning plays a role in cardioprotection. Furthermore,  blocks the cardioprotective effect of postconditioning at least in part via deterioration of the postconditioning-induced early increase in peroxynitrite formation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12672736>Association of nitrotyrosine levels with cardiovascular disease and modulation by statin therapy.</a></h1><p>Formation of nitric oxide-derived oxidants may serve as a mechanism linking inflammation to development of atherosclerosis. Nitrotyrosine, a specific marker for protein modification by nitric oxide-derived oxidants, is enriched in human atherosclerotic lesions and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) recovered from human atheroma.To determine whether systemic levels of nitrotyrosine are associated with the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and are modulated by hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy.A case-control and interventional study at 2 urban tertiary-care referral centers; recruitment for each was from June 1, 2001, until January 1, 2002. For the case-control study, 100 case-patients with established CAD and 108 patients with no clinically evident CAD were recruited consecutively. In the interventional study, participants aged 21 years or older with hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol > or =130 mg/dL [> or =3.5 mmol/L]) underwent nutrition and exercise counseling. Those whose levels did not decrease with 6 to 8 weeks were enrolled in the study (n = 35). For 12 weeks, they received 10 mg/d of oral atorvastatin therapy.In the case-control study, the association between systemic levels of protein-bound nitrotyrosine, CAD risk, and presence of CAD. In the interventional study, the change in nitrotyrosine, lipoprotein, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.Nitrotyrosine levels were significantly higher among patients with CAD (median 9.1 micromol/mol [interquartile range, 4.8-13.8 micromol/mol]  vs 5.2 micromol/mol [interquartile range, 2.2-8.4 micromol/mol]; P<.001). Patients in the upper quartile of nitrotyrosine (29%; P<.001) had a higher odds of CAD compared with those in the lowest quartile (unadjusted odds ratio, 6.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-14.0; P<.001). In multivariate models adjusting for Framingham Global Risk Score and CRP, upper quartiles of nitrotyrosine remained associated with CAD (odds ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-10.6; P<.001). Statin therapy reduced nitrotyrosine levels significantly (25%; P<.02) with a magnitude similar to reductions in total cholesterol levels (25%; P<.001) and LDL particle number (29%; P<.001) yet were independent of alterations in lipoproteins and inflammatory markers like CRP.The findings from this preliminary study indicate that nitrotyrosine levels are associated with the presence of CAD and appear to be modulated by statin therapy. These results suggest a potential role for nitric oxide-derived oxidants as inflammatory mediators in CAD and may have implications for atherosclerosis risk assessment and monitoring of anti-inflammatory actions of statins.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18922966>Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets in steatosis and steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>Steatosis of the liver may arise from a variety of conditions, but the molecular basis for lipid droplet formation is poorly understood. Although a certain amount of lipid storage may even be hepatoprotective, prolonged lipid storage can result in an activation of inflammatory reactions and loss of metabolic competency. Apart from drug-induced steatosis, certain metabolic disorders associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and  give also rise to nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). It is noteworthy that advanced stages of nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis (NASH) result ultimately in fibrosis and cirrhosis. In this regard, the lipid droplets (LDs) have been discovered to be metabolically highly active structures that play major roles in lipid transport, sorting, and signaling cascades. In particular, LDs maintain a dynamic communication with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane via sphingolipid-enriched domains of the plasma membrane-the lipid rafts. These microdomains frequently harbor receptor  kinases and other signaling molecules and connect extracellular events with intracellular signaling cascades. Here, we review recent knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of drug and metabolically induced hepatic steatosis and its progression to steatohepatitis (NASH). The contribution of cytokines and other signaling molecules, as well as activity of nuclear receptors, lipids, transcription factors, and endocrine mediators toward cellular dysfunction and progression of steatotic liver disease to NASH is specifically addressed, as is the cross-talk of different cell types in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Furthermore, we provide an overview of recent therapeutic approaches in NASH therapy and discuss new as well as putative targets for pharmacological interventions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22468040>Involvement of Depressive Catecholamines as Thrombosis Risk/Inflammatory Markers in Non-Smoker, Non-Obese Congestive Heart Failure, Linked to Increased Epidermal Growth Factor-Receptor (EGF-R) Production.</a></h1><p>The EGF-R, also known as HER-1 or erbB-1 (EGF-R/HER-1/erbB-1), is a member of the human epithelial receptor  kinase family. sEGF-R is considered to play a role in cardiac (patho)physiology. We aimed to investigate whether soluble EGF-R is increased in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients and if related to disease severity. Soluble EGF-R, vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH) was studied, and being evaluated in relation to Ca(2+), lipids, hsCRP, fibrinogen, serotonin, norepinepherine (NE). The study compared non-smoker, non-obese male CHF patients (n = 50) with age and gender-matched essential hypertension (HTN) patients (n = 20). Moreover, comparison with healthy control volunteers (n = 20) were employed. EGF-R/HER-1/erbB-1 was higher (P = 0.013) in 50 CHF male patients mean 12 ± 0.7 fmol/ml, than in 20 HTN, 9.25 ± 0.6 fmol/ml or in 20 controls, 6.25 ± 1 fmol/ml. Serum EGF-R levels correlated positively with hsCRP and NE, and were highest among CVD patients (n = 70) as well as negatively with vitamin D and HDL-C. EGF-R/HER-1/erbB-1 levels are increased in HTN and more in CHF patients. This study confirms a strong association between catecholamines as well as EGF-R/HER-1/erbB-1 levels with PTH and low vitamin D levels, being related to  and inflammation (hsCRP and fibrinogen) in CVD.

Although the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines offer physicians evidence-based recommendations for therapy, there are few real-world studies to help inform the utilization of these agents in clinical practice.To (a) describe the patterns of use associated with systemic therapies for mRCC among Humana members in the United States diagnosed with mRCC, (b) assess consistency with the NCCN guidelines for treatment, and (c) to describe the initial first-line therapy regimen by prescriber specialty and site of care.This was a retrospective study using Humana's claims database of commercially insured patients and patients insured by the Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plan. The study period was from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2013. Patients with mRCC were identified by ICD-9-CM codes 189.0/189.1 and 196.xx to 199.xx; all patients were between 18 and 89 years of age, had received systemic therapy for their disease, and were followed up for 180 days. Outcome measures included choice of initial systemic therapy, starting and ending doses, first-line treatment persistence and compliance, and choice of second-line therapy. Persistence was measured using time to discontinuation of first-line therapy and proportion of days covered (PDC; the ratio of [total days of drug available minus days of supply of last prescription] to [last prescription date minus first prescription date]). Compliance was measured using the medication possession ratio (MPR; the ratio of [total days supply minus days supply of last prescription] to [last prescription date minus first prescription date]).A total of 649 patients met all inclusion criteria; 109 were insured by commercial plans and 540 were insured by Medicare. The mean ± SD age of patients was 68.6 ± 9.4 years, and 68.6% were male; Medicare patients were older than commercial patients (71.7 ± 7.4 vs. 56.6 ± 9.1 years, respectively; P < 0.001). The most common comorbidities among the patient population were hypertension, , diabetes, and heart disease. The majority of patients (68.6%) received an oral  kinase inhibitor (TKI) as their first line of therapy: 43.9% received sunitinib, 14.0% received sorafenib, 10.0% received pazopanib, and 0.6% received axitinib. Mean ± SD time to discontinuation of first-line TKI treatment was 169.1 ± 29.5 days with sunitinib, 160.3 ± 41.1 days with pazopanib, and 160.1 ± 41.4 days with sorafenib. Other first-line therapies included inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (19.7%) and the antivascular endothelial growth factor agent bevacizumab (9.4%). Among patients receiving mTOR inhibitors, 14.8% were started on temsirolimus and 4.9% were started on everolimus. The median starting and ending doses were the same for each drug except for sunitinib. Mean ± SD times to discontinuation of temsirolimus, everolimus, and bevacizumab were 171.8 ± 26.2, 137.0 ± 62.2, and 150.8 ± 56.0 days, respectively. Persistence on first-line regimen as measured by PDC was high (PDC ≥ 80%) for 89% of oral therapies and 77% of injectable therapies; first-line compliance was high (MPR ≥ 80%) for 77% of oral therapies and 68% of injectables. Among patients who received second-line therapy, the most common regimen was everolimus (29.2%), followed by bevacizumab (19.8%), temsirolimus (15.6%), and sunitinib (13.6%). Specialty codes obtained from the database provider identified internal medicine specialists and oncologists as the most common prescribers of TKIs and mTOR inhibitors.Patterns of use were similar for each of the prescribed systemic treatments for mRCC, and the majority of patients were highly persistent and compliant with first-line therapies. Time to treatment discontinuation was slightly longer with oral agents compared with injectable drugs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11882599>Lysophosphatidylcholine inhibits insulin-induced Akt activation through protein kinase C-alpha in vascular smooth muscle cells.</a></h1><p>To better understand the intracellular signaling mechanism that causes the association of insulin resistance and  with cardiovascular diseases, we specifically looked at the ability of lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) to inhibit the Akt activation induced by insulin in cultured rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells. LysoPC inhibited the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, and the inhibition was concentration dependent. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, inhibited the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt. LysoPC stimulated PKC phosphorylation at Ser660, which was inhibited by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X. The PKC-alpha/beta-selective inhibitor Go6976 also blocked the PMA- and lysoPC-induced inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by insulin. PKC-alpha, but not PKC-beta, is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, and overexpression of PKC-alpha, but not PKC-beta or PKC-delta, inhibited insulin-induced Akt activation. LysoPC rapidly stimulated PKC-alpha translocation to the membrane. In contrast, pretreatment with the p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 or the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor SB203580 did not block the lysoPC-induced inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by insulin. In addition, lysoPC inhibited the insulin-induced  phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 but not that of the insulin receptor beta subunit or insulin binding. PMA treatment or PKC-alpha overexpression also inhibited the  phosphorylation of IRS-1. From these data, we conclude that lysoPC negatively regulates the insulin signal at the point of IRS-1 through PKC-alpha in the vasculature, which may explain the association of  with hyperinsulinemia in cardiovascular diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15184275>Circulating CD34-positive cells provide an index of cerebrovascular function.</a></h1><p>Increasing evidence points to a role for circulating endothelial progenitor cells, including populations of CD34- and CD133-positive cells present in peripheral blood, in maintenance of the vasculature and neovascularization. Immature populations, including CD34-positive cells, have been shown to contribute to vascular homeostasis, not only as a pool of endothelial progenitor cells but also as a source of growth/angiogenesis factors at ischemic loci. We hypothesized that diminished numbers of circulating immature cells might impair such physiological and reparative processes, potentially contributing to cerebrovascular dysfunction.The level of circulating immature cells, CD34-, CD133-, CD117-, and CD135-positive cells, in patients with a history of atherothrombotic cerebral ischemic events was analyzed to assess possible correlations with the degree of carotid atherosclerosis and number of cerebral infarctions. There was a strong inverse correlation between numbers of circulating CD34- and CD133-positive cells and cerebral infarction. In contrast, there was no correlation between the degree of atherosclerosis and populations of circulating immature cells. Analysis of patients with cerebral artery occlusion revealed a significant positive correlation between circulating CD34- and CD133-positive cells and regional blood flow in areas of chronic hypoperfusion.These results suggest a possible contribution of circulating CD34- and CD133-positive cells in maintenance of the cerebral circulation in settings of ischemic stress. Our data demonstrate the utility of a simple and precise method to quantify circulating CD34-positive cells, the latter providing a marker of cerebrovascular function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22743057>TG accumulation inhibitory effects of Jinqi formula by AMPK signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>Jinqi formula is a traditional Chinese anti-diabetic formula containing three ingredients (Coptidis rhizoma, Astragali rhadix and Lonicerae japonicae Flos).The active fractions of Jinqi formula were purified and HPLC analyses were used for quality control. The anti-adipogenic effects of Jinqi formula were analyzed in vitro using 3T3-L1 cells and in vivo with KK-A(y) mice. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to confirm genes and proteins of interest, respectively.In vitro study showed that Jinqi formula suppressed the accumulation of triglyceride (TG) and free fatty acids (FFA) in mature 3T3-L1 cells by increasing the expression and  phosphorylation of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), as well as decreasing the expression of Acetyl CoA Carboxylase (ACC), Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS) and Hormone Sensitive Lipase (HSL). In vivo study demonstrated that Jinqi formula reduced body weight without changing food intake in KK-A(y) mice, and decreased the levels of serum glucose, TG, FFA. In addition, consistent with the in vitro study results, Jinqi formula increased the expression and  phosphorylation of AMPK in the liver and muscular tissues of the KK-A(y) mice. Furthermore, Jingqi formula suppressed the expression of ACC and HSL and upregulated the expression of IRS-1 in the liver. Whereas in the skeletal muscles, Jingqi formula decreased the expression of ACC and increased the expression of GLUT-4 and IRS-2.Jingqi formula inhibits TG accumulation at least in part via the stimulation of AMPK activity in a multi-target manner.Crown Copyright © 2012.

A four-week high-fat feeding to mice increased the body weight, fat mass, and plasma levels of insulin and lipid, which were reduced by hemin. High-fat diet reduced whole body glucose uptake, which were increased by hemin. Insulin-stimulated hepatic glucose production (HGP) was increased by high-fat diet, but hemin had no significant effect on HGP. Skeletal muscle glucose uptake was reduced by high-fat diet, and hemin normalized the glucose uptake. High-fat diet increased triglyceride levels and mRNA levels of lipogenic enzymes, and decreased mRNA levels of enzymes involved in lipid β-oxidation, which was reversed by hemin. Phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase levels were increased in the skeletal muscle of high fat-fed hemin-injected mice. High-fat diet reduced mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes and increased mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines and nitrotyrosine levels, which was normalized by hemin in the skeletal muscle. However, hemin had no significant effect on these factors in the liver. These results suggest that hemin prevents the development of high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance by increased insulin sensitivity in the skeletal muscle.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16199199>Metabolic derangements in deficiency of citrin, a liver-type mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier.</a></h1><p>Citrin, encoded by SLC25A13, is a liver-type mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier (AGC), of which deficiency, in autosomal recessive trait, causes neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis (NICCD) and adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). NICCD patients have jaundice, hypoproteinemia, hypoglycemia, galactosemia, growth retardation, fatty liver and multiple aminoacidemia including citrulline, methionine, threonine and . Some of the neonates who have experienced NICCD suffer from severe CTLN2 more than 10 years or several decades later. In CTLN2, neuropsychotic symptoms such as disorientation, aberrant behavior, coma and death are observed. Laboratory findings reveal hyperammonemia, citrullinemia, fatty liver and liver-specific decrease in a urea cycle enzyme, argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS). In some cases, , pancreatitis and hepatoma are accompanied with CTLN2. Citrin as a liver-type AGC plays a role in supplying aspartate to the cytosol for urea, protein and nucleotide synthesis by exchanging mitochondrial aspartate for cytosolic glutamate and proton, and transporting cytosolic NADH reducing equivalent to mitochondria as a member of malate aspartate shuttle essential for aerobic glycolysis. AGC is also important for gluconeogenesis from lactate. Although it is difficult to explain pathogenesis of the symptoms such as cholestasis in NICCD and liver-specific decrease of ASS protein in CTLN2 from the functions of the AGC, some are understandable by the loss of citrin functions. Many CTLN2 patients have been treated with a low protein and high carbohydrate diet and glycerol at the hyperammonemic coma. We argue that those treatments may result in fatty liver, , hyperammonemia and even death due to loss of the citrin functions. Loss of citrin first cause deficiency of aspartate in the cytosol, which results in an increase in cytosolic NADH/NAD(+) ratio and then activation of fatty acid synthesis pathway to compensate the aberrant ratio. This follows inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. The peculiar fondness for food of CTLN2 patients who like protein and dislike carbohydrate and sweets may be related to their metabolic requirements.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27704688>FAK contributes to proteinuria in hypercholesterolaemic rats and modulates podocyte F-actin re-organization via activating p38 in response to ox-LDL.</a></h1><p>Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor protein  kinase that regulates cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. In the present study, a rat model of high fat diet-induced hypercholesterolaemia was established to investigate the involvement of FAK in lipid disorder-related kidney diseases. We showed focal fusion of podocyte foot process that occurred at as early as 4 weeks in rats consuming high fat diet, preceding the onset of proteinuria when aberrant phosphorylation of FAK was found. These abnormalities were ameliorated by dietary intervention of TAE226, a reported inhibitor of FAK. FAK is also an adaptor protein initiating cascades of intracellular signals including c-Src, Rho GTPase and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). P38 MAPK belongs to the latter and is centrally involved in kidney diseases. Our cell culture data revealed oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) triggered hyper-phosphorylation of FAK and p38, ectopic expression of cellular markers (manifested as decreased WT1, podocin and NEPH1, and increased vimentin and mmp9), and re-arrangement of F-actin filaments with enhanced cell motility; these mutations were significantly rectified by FAK shRNA. Notably, pre-treatment of p38 inhibitor did not alter FAK activation, albeit its deletion of p38 hyper-activity and attenuation of cellular abnormalities, demonstrating that p38 acted as a downstream effector of FAK signalling and ox-LDL damaged podocytes in a FAK/p38-dependent manner. This was further identified by animal data that p38 activation was also abrogated by TAE226 treatment in hypercholesterolaemic rats, suggesting that FAK/p38 axis might also be involved in in vivo events. These findings provided a potential early mechanism of hypercholesterolaemia-related podocyte damage and proteinuria.© 2016 The Authors.

In the absence of GPIHBP1, LPL remains mislocalized within the subendothelial spaces, causing severe hypertriglyceridemia (chylomicronemia). The N-terminal domain of GPIHBP1, an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) rich in acidic residues, is important for stabilizing LPL's catalytic domain against spontaneous and ANGPTL4-catalyzed unfolding. Here, we define several important properties of GPIHBP1's IDR. First, a conserved  in the middle of the IDR is posttranslationally modified by O-sulfation; this modification increases both the affinity of GPIHBP1-LPL interactions and the ability of GPIHBP1 to protect LPL against ANGPTL4-catalyzed unfolding. Second, the acidic IDR of GPIHBP1 increases the probability of a GPIHBP1-LPL encounter via electrostatic steering, increasing the association rate constant () for LPL binding by >250-fold. Third, we show that LPL accumulates near capillary endothelial cells even in the absence of GPIHBP1. In wild-type mice, we expect that the accumulation of LPL in close proximity to capillaries would increase interactions with GPIHBP1. Fourth, we found that GPIHBP1's IDR is not a key factor in the pathogenicity of chylomicronemia in patients with the GPIHBP1 autoimmune syndrome. Finally, based on biophysical studies, we propose that the negatively charged IDR of GPIHBP1 traverses a vast space, facilitating capture of LPL by capillary endothelial cells and simultaneously contributing to GPIHBP1's ability to preserve LPL structure and activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26971533>Long-term evaluation of cardiac and vascular toxicity in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias treated with bosutinib.</a></h1><p>Vascular and cardiac safety during  kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is an emerging issue. We evaluated vascular/cardiac toxicities associated with long-term bosutinib treatment for Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia based on treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and changes in QTc intervals and ejection fraction in two studies: a phase 1/2 study of second-/third-/fourth-line bosutinib for Ph+ leukemia resistant/intolerant to prior TKIs (N = 570) and a phase 3 study of first-line bosutinib (n = 248) versus imatinib (n = 251) in chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia. Follow-up time was ≥48 months (both studies). Incidences of vascular/cardiac TEAEs in bosutinib-treated patients were 7%/10% overall with similar incidences observed with first-line bosutinib (5%/8%) and imatinib (4%/6%). Few patients had grade ≥3 vascular/cardiac events (4%/4%) and no individual TEAE occurred in >2% of bosutinib patients. Exposure-adjusted vascular/cardiac TEAE rates (patients with events/patient-year) were low for second-line or later bosutinib (0.037/0.050) and not significantly different between first-line bosutinib (0.015/0.024) and imatinib (0.011/0.017; P ≥ 0.267). Vascular/cardiac events were managed mainly with concomitant medications (39%/44%), bosutinib treatment interruptions (18%/21%), or dose reductions (4%/8%); discontinuations due to these events were rare (0.7%/1.0%). Based on logistic regression modelling, performance status >0 and history of vascular or cardiac disorders were prognostic of vascular/cardiac events in relapsed/refractory patients; /hypercholesterolemia and older age were prognostic of cardiac events. In newly diagnosed patients, older age was prognostic of vascular/cardiac events; history of diabetes was prognostic of vascular events. Incidences of vascular and cardiac events were low with bosutinib in the first-line and relapsed/refractory settings following long-term treatment in patients with Ph+ leukemia. Am. J.

This study aimed to investigate IS in the liver and skeletal muscle (SM) and disorders related to the serum lipid profile and glucose and insulin levels of nondiabetic rats with induced chronic periapical lesions (PLs).Twenty-eight Wistar rats were divided into control and PL groups. PLs were induced by exposing the pulpal tissue to the oral environment. Experiments were conducted in both groups 30 days after pulp exposure. Maxillae were processed for histopathological analysis. IS was evaluated according to insulin receptor substrate (pp185-insulin receptor substrate 1 [IRS-1]/insulin receptor substrate 2 [IRS-2])  phosphorylation status, IRS-1 serine phosphorylation status, and IRS-1 and IRS-2 content in the liver and SM by Western blotting. Serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, and insulin levels were measured enzymatically using a commercial kit.PL rats showed reduced pp185 P-Tyr and increased IRS-1 serine phosphorylation status in the SM but no change in the liver after insulin stimulation. No significant changes in IRS-1 and IRS-2 content, serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose or insulin levels were noted.PLs are associated with decreased insulin signaling in the SM of rats. Because a decrease in insulin signaling is associated with insulin resistance, our results emphasize the importance of preventing local inflammatory diseases such as PLs to prevent alterations in IS in muscle.Copyright © 2015 American Association of Endodontists.

Lipid accumulation and lipid oxidation are associated with decreased EC migration and intimal hyperplasia. The goal of this study was to assess the ability of antioxidants to improve graft healing in hypercholesterolemic animals.Rabbits were placed in one of four groups: chow plus N-acetylcysteine (NAC), chow plus probucol, chow with 1% cholesterol plus NAC, or chow with 1% cholesterol plus probucol. After 2 weeks, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (12 cm long x 4-mm internal diameter) were implanted in the abdominal aorta. Grafts were removed after 6 weeks and analyzed for cholesterol content, EC coverage, anastomotic intimal thickness, and the cellular composition of the neointima. Plasma samples were obtained to assess systemic oxidative stress. The data were compared with previously reported data from animals fed diets of chow and chow with 1% cholesterol.Prosthetic grafts from rabbits fed chow with 1% cholesterol had significantly greater anastomotic intimal thickening and lower EC coverage than grafts from rabbits fed a regular chow diet. In hypercholesterolemic rabbits, antioxidant therapy decreased global oxidative stress as evidenced by a 40% decrease in plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. In rabbits fed the chow with 1% cholesterol diet, NAC decreased intimal hyperplasia at the proximal anastomosis by 29% and significantly increased graft EC coverage from 46% to 71% (P = .03). Following a similar pattern, probucol decreased intimal hyperplasia by 43% and increased graft EC coverage to 53% in hypercholesterolemic rabbits.Global oxidative stress and anastomotic intimal hyperplasia are increased, and endothelialization of prosthetic grafts is significantly reduced in rabbits fed a high-cholesterol diet. Antioxidant treatment improves EC coverage and decreases intimal hyperplasia. Reducing oxidative stress may promote healing of prosthetic grafts.Copyright 2010 Society for Vascular Surgery.

It has been shown that an imbalance in the ratio of nitric oxide to superoxide anion due to a prevalence of the superoxide anion leads to an alteration in vascular reactivity. Under these conditions an increase in peroxynitrite (ONOO-) production, resulting from the reaction between nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O2-), may be hypothesised. ONOO- is responsible for nitration of  residues in proteins; therefore the presence of nitrotyrosine (NT) in plasma proteins is considered indirect evidence of ONOO- production. NT has been found in the plasma of patients with diabetes, but it is not detectable in the plasma of healthy controls. NT plasma values are correlated with plasma glucose concentrations, and further studies exploring the effects of acute hyperglycaemia on NT formation confirmed that NT is produced both in normal subjects during hyperglycaemic clamp and in working hearts from rats during hyperglycaemic perfusion. Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycaemia are considered risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Evidence suggests that postprandial hypertriglyceridaemia and hyperglycaemia induce an endothelial dysfunction through an oxidative stress; however, the specific roles of these two factors are matters for debate. In a clinical study, high-fat load and glucose alone each produced a decrease in endothelial function and an increase in NT in normal subjects and patients with diabetes. These effects were more pronounced when high-fat load and glucose were combined. Short-term simvastatin treatment had no effect on lipid parameters, but reduced the effects of high-fat load, glucose alone, and both high-fat load and glucose on endothelial function and NT Long-term simvastatin treatment was accompanied by a smaller increase in postprandial triglycerides, which was followed by smaller variations in endothelial function and NT. This study showed an independent and cumulative effect of postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycaemia on endothelial function, suggesting oxidative stress as a common mediator of these effects. Simvastatin shows a beneficial effect on oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, which may be ascribed to a direct effect as well as the lipid-lowering action of the drug. These studies indicate that ONOO- is generated in diabetes, suggesting the possible involvement of ONOO- in the development of diabetic complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12172480>Inflammatory status and insulin resistance.</a></h1><p>The inflammatory response is essential in the response to pathogens. TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6 are key mediators of the response. They initiate metabolic changes to provide nutrients for the immune system, from host tissues. These changes include  and increased gluconeogenesis. Insulin resistance and disordering of lipid metabolism occur in obesity, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis. This review examines recent research that links inflammation to insulin insensitivity.Population studies show a strong association between indices of inflammation, and abnormal lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, obesity and atherosclerosis. TNF-alpha is produced, by cells of the immune system and by adipocytes. It may provide the link between inflammation and insulin sensitivity. TNF-alpha results in insulin insensitivity, indirectly by stimulating stress hormone production and directly by sustained induction of SOCS-3 which decreases insulin-induced insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1)  phosphorylation and its association with the p85, regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase; and by negative regulation of PPAR gamma. Adipose tissue produces both TNF-alpha and leptin. Production of the latter relates positively to adipose tissue mass and through its actions on immune function exerts a pro-inflammatory influence.Recent studies on diseases which involve insulin insensitivity (e.g. obesity, type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis) also show increased cytokine production and markers of inflammation. Evidence at present favours chronic inflammation as a trigger for chronic insulin insensitivity, rather than the reverse situation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14514640>Inhibition of net HepG2 cell apolipoprotein B secretion by the citrus flavonoid naringenin involves activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, independent of insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylation.</a></h1><p>The flavonoid naringenin improves  and hyperglycemia in streptozotocin-treated rats. In HepG2 human hepatoma cells, naringenin inhibits apolipoprotein B (apoB) secretion primarily by inhibiting microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and enhances LDL receptor (LDLr)-mediated apoB-containing lipoprotein uptake. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation by insulin increases sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1 and LDLr expression and inhibits apoB secretion in hepatocytes. Thus, we determined whether naringenin activates this pathway. Insulin and naringenin induced PI3K-dependent increases in cytosolic and nuclear SREBP-1 and LDLr expression. Similar PI3K-mediated increases in SREBP-1 were observed in McA-RH7777 rat hepatoma cells, which express predominantly SREBP-1c. Reductions in HepG2 cell media apoB with naringenin were partially attenuated by wortmannin, whereas the effect of insulin was completely blocked. Both treatments reduced apoB100 secretion in wild-type and LDLr(-/-) mouse hepatocytes to the same extent. Insulin and naringenin increased HepG2 cell PI3K activity and decreased insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2 levels. In sharp contrast to insulin, naringenin did not induce  phosphorylation of IRS-1. We conclude that naringenin increases LDLr expression in HepG2 cells via PI3K-mediated upregulation of SREBP-1, independent of IRS-1 phosphorylation. Although this pathway may not regulate apoB secretion in primary hepatocytes, PI3K activation by this novel mechanism may explain the insulin-like effects of naringenin in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23643523>Fructose during pregnancy affects maternal and fetal leptin signaling.</a></h1><p>Fructose intake from added sugars correlates with the epidemic rise in obesity, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. Fructose intake also causes features of metabolic syndrome in laboratory animals. Therefore, we have investigated whether fructose modifies lipidemia in pregnant rats and produces changes in their fetuses. Thus, fructose administration (10% wt/vol.) in the drinking water of rats throughout gestation leads to maternal hypertriglyceridemia. This change was not observed in glucose-fed rats, although both carbohydrates produced similar changes in liver triglycerides and in the expression of transcription factors and enzymes involved in lipogenesis. After fasting overnight, mothers fed with carbohydrates were found to be hyperleptinemic. However, after a bolus of glucose, leptinemia in fructose-fed mothers showed no response, whereas it increased in parallel in glucose-fed and control mothers. Fetuses from fructose-fed mothers showed hypotriglyceridemia and a higher hepatic triglyceride content than fetuses from control or glucose-fed mothers. A higher expression of genes related to lipogenesis and a lower expression of fatty acid catabolism genes were also found in fetuses from fructose-fed mothers. Moreover, although hyperleptinemic, these fetuses exhibited increased  phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) protein, without a parallel increase in the serine phosphorylation of STAT-3 nor in the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 protein levels whose expression is regulated by leptin through STAT-3 activation. Thus, fructose intake during gestation provoked a diminished maternal leptin response to fasting and refeeding and an impairment in the transduction of the leptin signal in the fetuses, which could be responsible for their hepatic steatosis.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Vitamin K2 (VK2) delays vascular calcification by an unclear mechanism. Moreover, apoptosis modulates vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification. This paper aimed to study VK2-modified VSMC calcification and survival cell signaling mediated by growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6) and its  kinase receptor Axl. Primary-cultured VSMCs were dose-dependently treated with VK2 in the presence of calcification medium for 8 days, or pre-treated for 1 h with/without the Axl inhibitor R428 (2 μmol/L) or the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (20 μmol/L) followed by treatment with VK2 (10 μmol/L) or rmGas6 (200 nmol/L) in calcification medium for 8 days. Calcium deposition was determined by the o-cresolphthalein complexone assay and Alizarin Red S staining. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL and flow cytometry using Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide staining. Western blotting detected the expressions of Axl, Gas6, p-Akt, Akt, and Bcl2. VK2 significantly inhibited CaCl- and β-sodium glycerophosphate (β-GP)-induced VSMC calcification and apoptosis, which was dependent on restored Gas6 expression and activated downstream signaling by Axl, p-Akt, and Bcl2. Z-VAD-fmk significantly inhibited CaCl- and β-GP-induced VSMC calcification and apoptosis. Augmented recombinant mouse Gas6 protein (rmGas6) expression significantly reduced VSMC calcification and apoptosis. Furthermore, the Gas6/Axl interaction was inhibited by R428, which abolished the preventive effect of VK2 on CaCl- and β-GP-induced apoptosis and calcification. These results suggest that Gas6 is critical in VK2-mediated functions that attenuate CaCl- and β-GP-induced VSMC calcification by blocking apoptosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11839631>Statins have biphasic effects on angiogenesis.</a></h1><p>Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase to reduce the synthesis of cholesterol and isoprenoids that modulate diverse cell functions. We investigated the effect of the statins cerivastatin and atorvastatin on angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.Endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation were enhanced at low concentrations (0.005 to 0.01 micromol/L) but significantly inhibited at high statin concentrations (0.05 to 1 micromol/L). Antiangiogenic effects at high concentrations were associated with decreased endothelial release of vascular endothelial growth factor and increased endothelial apoptosis and were reversed by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. In murine models, inflammation-induced angiogenesis was enhanced with low-dose statin therapy (0.5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) but significantly inhibited with high concentrations of cerivastatin or atorvastatin (2.5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)). Despite the fact that high-dose statin treatment was effective at reducing lipid levels in hyperlipidemic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, it impaired rather than enhanced angiogenesis. Finally, high-dose cerivastatin decreased tumor growth and tumor vascularization in a murine Lewis lung cancer model.HMG-CoA reductase inhibition has a biphasic dose-dependent effect on angiogenesis that is lipid independent and associated with alterations in endothelial apoptosis and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling. Statins have proangiogenic effects at low therapeutic concentrations but angiostatic effects at high concentrations that are reversed by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. At clinically relevant doses, statins may modulate angiogenesis in humans via effects on geranylated proteins.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26634202>Influence of Sorghum Kafirin on Serum Lipid Profile and Antioxidant Activity in Hyperlipidemic Rats (In Vitro and In Vivo Studies).</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to compare in vitro the antioxidant potential of sorghum kafirin and sorghum flour and their influence on lipids and antioxidant capacity in rats. The antioxidant activity in sorghum kafirin extract measured by the DPPH and TEAC methods was increased 30 and 65 times, respectively, compared to that of its counterpart, sorghum flour. According to electrophoresis assay, the kafirins tert-butanol extract showed a high proportion of α-kafirin monomers, and its amino acid composition revealed higher hydrophobic amino acid content such as alanine, isoleucine, leucine,  and phenylalanine than sorghum flour extract. Diets supplemented with sorghum kafirin extract have improved lipid metabolism and increased the serum antioxidant potential (67%) especially in rats fed with added cholesterol. The bioactive peptides generated from kafirin in vivo hydrolysis appear to be associated with the positive effect on serum lipids and antioxidant activity. According to these results, sorghum kafirin extract at the levels used in this study apparently could be used for prevention of atherosclerosis and other chronic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25234566>Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: the c.1055G>A mutation in the LDLR gene and clinical heterogeneity.</a></h1><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a world public health issue because of its high frequency, morbidity, and mortality. FH is characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and a high risk for premature cardiovascular disease. We report an 8-year-old male with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The clinical and biochemical characteristics of this case were bilateral corneal arcus, xanthomas in several body parts, severe stenosis of the left carotid artery and serum total cholesterol levels of 782.0 mg/dL and 715.0 mg/dL LDL-C. The initial treatment was atorvastatin (40 mg) and ezetimibe (20 mg), with no satisfactory response. LDLR gene was analyzed and homozygosity for c.1055G>A mutation was observed, resulting in an amino acid change from cysteine to  in codon 352 (p.Cys352Tyr). This mutation is known as Mexico 2 and has only been observed in the Mexican population. Both parents and siblings were carriers of the same mutation, but the paternal grandmother and the father of the index case showed the phenomenon of incomplete penetrance. With the analysis 5 polymorphisms (rs1003723C>T, rs5930A>G, rs688C>T, rs5929T>C and rs5927A>G), a common ancestor for the mutation can be suggested and linkage to TGTCG haplotype.Copyright © 2014 National Lipid Association.

Various endogenous molecules, including cholesterol, have been put forward as putative contributors in the pathogenesis of PD. Earlier reports have provided a strong link between the elevated level of plasma cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia) and onset of PD. However, the role of hypercholesterolemia on brain functions in terms of neurotransmitter metabolism and associated behavioral manifestations remain elusive. We tested in Swiss albino mice whether hypercholesterolemia induced by high-cholesterol diet would affect dopamine and serotonin metabolism in discrete brain regions that would precipitate in psychomotor behavioral manifestations. High-cholesterol diet for 12 weeks caused a significant increase in blood total cholesterol level, which validated the model as hypercholesterolemic. Tests for akinesia, catalepsy, swimming ability and gait pattern (increased stride length) have revealed that hypercholesterolemic mice develop motor behavioral abnormalities, which are similar to the behavioral phenotypes of PD. Moreover, hypercholesterolemia caused depressive-like behavior in mice, as indicated by the increased immobility time in the forced swim test. We found a significant depletion of dopamine in striatum and serotonin in cortex of hypercholesterolemic mice. The significant decrease in  hydroxylase immunoreactivity in striatum supports the observed depleted level dopamine in striatum, which is relevant to the pathophysiology of PD. In conclusion, hypercholesterolemia-induced depleted levels of cortical and striatal biogenic amines reported hereby are similar to the PD pathology, which might be associated with the observed psychomotor behavioral abnormalities.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically,  and the glomerular deposition of atherogenic lipoproteins (e.g., Low density lipoprotein, LDL; and its oxidized variants) are implicated in key pathobiological processes involved in the development of glomerular disease, including stimulation of monocyte infiltration into the mesangial space, mesangial cell hypercellularity, and mesangial extracellular matrix deposition. This review discusses recent understanding of glomerular mitogenic responses, intracellular signaling events associated with mesangial hypercellularity in renal diseases, and the participation of cholesterol and atherogenic lipoproteins in intracellular signaling pathways involved in mesangial cell proliferation. Generally, the mitogenic intracellular signaling pathways are regulated by the activation of series of transmembrane and cytoplasmic protein  kinases that converge into the activation of Ras and down-stream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase). Activated MAP kinase, through translocating into the nucleus and the activation of various transcription factors and protooncogenes, regulate cell proliferation. The importance of mitogenic intracellular signaling in mesangial proliferative disease has only recently been recognized and showed that the activation of MAP kinase and/or cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinases play crucial role in different phases of cell growth cycle and hypercellularity of glomerular cells in various experimental renal diseases. Using glomerular mesangial cells as an in-vitro model system, studies from our laboratory indicated that the accumulation of LDL and more potently its oxidized forms within the glomerulus, through the activation of membrane receptor  kinases (e.g., EGF receptor), activate Ras and MAP kinase signaling cascade leading to DNA synthesis and subsequent mesangial cell proliferation. These data suggest that atherogenic lipoproteins may act as one of the major endogenous modulators for mitogenic signaling response and cell proliferation within the glomerulus. It is reasonable to speculate that the correction or reduction of , glomerular lipid deposition, and the pro-oxidative milieu within the glomerulus, through the inhibition of mitogenic signaling events, may provide protective environment against mesangial hypercellularity and subsequent matrix deposition, and the progression of renal disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19960012>Application of GC/MS-based metabonomic profiling in studying the lipid-regulating effects of Ginkgo biloba extract on diet-induced  in rats.</a></h1><p>To evaluate the lipid-regulating effects of extract from Ginkgo biloba leaves (EGB) using pharmacological methods and metabonomic profiling in a rat model of diet-induced .EGB was orally administered at a dose level of 40 mg/kg in both the EGB-prevention and -treatment groups. All rat samples obtained were examined for known and potential biomarkers and enzyme activity using commercial assay kits and GC/MS-based metabonomic profiling coupled with principal component analysis (PCA).The data obtained from the assay kits indicated that EGB reduced total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in rat plasma obtained from both the EGB-prevention and -treatment groups compared with those of the diet-induced  group. EGB also increased the activities of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase and excretion of fecal bile acid in rats from the EGB-prevention and-treatment groups. Using GC/MS-based metabonomic analysis, more than 40 endogenous metabolites were identified in rat plasma. PCA of rat plasma samples obtained using GC/MS produced a distinctive separation of the four treatment groups and sampling points within each group. Metabolic changes during  formation and improvement resulting from EGB treatment were definitively monitored with PCA score plots. Furthermore, elevated levels of sorbitol, , glutamine and glucose, and decreased levels of citric acid, galactose, palmitic acid, arachidonic acid, acetic acid, cholesterol, butyrate, creatinine, linoleate, ornithine and proline, were observed in the plasma of rats treated with EGB.EGB exerts multi-directional lipid-lowering effects on the rat metabonome, including limitation of the absorption of cholesterol, inactivation of HMGCoA and favorable regulation of profiles of essential polyunsaturated fatty acid (EFA).

Importantly, simvastatin has also been reported to have anti-tumor effect, but the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. We collected several human bladder samples and performed microarray. Data analysis suggested bladder cancer (BCa) was significantly associated with fatty acid/lipid metabolism via PPAR signalling pathway. We observed simvastatin did not trigger BCa cell apoptosis, but reduced cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, accompanied by PPARγ-activation. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis indicated that simvastatin induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, suggested by downregulation of CDK4/6 and Cyclin D1. Furthermore, simvastatin suppressed BCa cell metastasis by inhibiting EMT and affecting AKT/GSK3β. More importantly, we found that the cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and the alterations of CDK4/6 and Cyclin D1 triggered by simvastatin could be recovered by PPARγ-antagonist (GW9662), whereas the treatment of PPARα-antagonist (GW6471) shown no significant effects on the BCa cells. Taken together, our study for the first time revealed that simvastatin inhibited bladder cancer cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest at G1/G0 phase via PPARγ signalling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19121803>Effects of simvastatin on cardiac neural and electrophysiologic remodeling in rabbits with hypercholesterolemia.</a></h1><p>Significant cardiac neural and electrophysiologic remodeling occurs with hypercholesterolemia (HC). Whether simvastatin can reverse HC-induced remodeling is unclear.The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanisms underlying the antiarrhythmic effects of statins.Rabbits (N = 38) were fed HC chow (HC), standard chow (Control), HC chow followed by standard chow (Withdrawal), or HC chow and simvastatin (Statin) for 8 weeks. The hearts then were Langendorff-perfused for electrophysiologic studies. Nerves were identified by immunostaining of growth-associated protein-43 (GAP43) and  hydroxylase (TH). Action potential duration (APD) restitution in normal hearts with (N = 5) and without (N = 5) simvastatin therapy also was studied.Serum cholesterol levels (mg/dL) were 1,855 +/- 533 in HC, 50 +/- 21 in Control, 570 +/- 115 in Withdrawal, and 873 +/- 112 in Statin groups (P <.001). Compared with HC (16,700 +/- 5,342; 12,200 +/- 3,878 microm(2)/mm(2)), the Statin group had significantly reduced GAP43-positive (10,289 +/- 3,393 microm(2)/mm(2), P = .03) and TH-positive (7,685 +/- 2,959 microm(2)/mm(2), P = .04) nerve density, respectively. APD was longer in HC rabbits than in controls (192 +/- 20 ms vs 174 +/- 17 ms; P <.03). Withdrawal and Statin groups had less APD prolongation than HC group. Statin group has less repolarization heterogeneity than HC group (P <.01). Statin therapy flattened the slope of APD restitution in normal hearts. Ventricular fibrillation was either induced or occurred spontaneously in 79% of hearts in HC, 20% in Control, and 66% in Withdrawal groups. However, there was no VF in hearts of Statin group (P <.001).Simvastatin significantly reduced vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation via the mechanism of reduction of HC-induced neural and electrophysiologic remodeling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22138235>Taurine exerts hypoglycemic effect in alloxan-induced diabetic rats, improves insulin-mediated glucose transport signaling pathway in heart and ameliorates cardiac oxidative stress and apoptosis.</a></h1><p>, inflammation and altered antioxidant profiles are the usual complications in diabetes mellitus. In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of taurine in diabetes associated cardiac complications using a rat model. Rats were made diabetic by alloxan (ALX) (single i.p. dose of 120mg/kg body weight) and left untreated or treated with taurine (1% w/v, orally, in water) for three weeks either from the day of ALX exposure or after the onset of diabetes. Animals were euthanized after three weeks. ALX-induced diabetes decreased body weight, increased glucose level, decreased insulin content, enhanced the levels of cardiac damage markers and altered lipid profile in the plasma. Moreover, it increased oxidative stress (decreased antioxidant enzyme activities and GSH/GSSG ratio, increased xanthine oxidase enzyme activity, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation and ROS generation) and enhanced the proinflammatory cytokines levels, activity of myeloperoxidase and nuclear translocation of NFκB in the cardiac tissue of the experimental animals. Taurine treatment could, however, result to a decrease in the elevated blood glucose and proinflammatory cytokine levels, diabetes-evoked oxidative stress, lipid profiles and NFκB translocation. In addition, taurine increased GLUT 4 translocation to the cardiac membrane by enhanced phosphorylation of IR and IRS1 at  and Akt at serine residue in the heart. Results also suggest that taurine could protect cardiac tissue from ALX induced apoptosis via the regulation of Bcl2 family and caspase 9/3 proteins. Taken together, taurine supplementation in regular diet could play a beneficial role in regulating diabetes and its associated complications in the heart.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In atherosclerotic lesions, macrophages constitute an important class of antigen-presenting cells that activate adaptive immune responses to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL). It has been reported that autophagy regulates adaptive immune responses by enhancing antigen presentation to MHC class II (MHC-II). In a previous study, we have demonstrated that SYK (spleen  kinase) regulates generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of MAPK8/JNK1 in macrophages. Because ROS and MAPK8 are known to regulate autophagy, in this study we investigated the role of SYK in autophagy, MHC-II expression and adaptive immune response to OxLDL. We demonstrate that OxLDL induces autophagosome formation, MHC-II expression, and phosphorylation of SYK in macrophages. Gene knockout and pharmacological inhibitors of NOX2 and MAPK8 reduced OxLDL-induced autophagy. Using bone marrow-derived macrophages isolated from wild-type and myeloid-specific SYK knockout mice, we demonstrate that SYK regulates OxLDL-induced ROS generation, MAPK8 activation, BECN1-BCL2 dissociation, autophagosome formation and presentation of OxLDL-derived antigens to CD4(+) T cells. ldlr(-/-) syk(-/-) mice fed a high-fat diet produced lower levels of IgG to malondialdehyde (MDA)-LDL, malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde (MAA)-LDL, and OxLDL compared to ldlr(-/-) mice. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms by which SYK regulates MHC-II expression via autophagy in macrophages and may contribute to regulation of adaptive immune responses in atherosclerosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12714561>Sympathetic nerve sprouting, electrical remodeling, and increased vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation in hypercholesterolemic rabbits.</a></h1><p>Whether hypercholesterolemia (HC) can induce proarrhythmic neural and electrophysiological remodeling is unclear. We fed rabbits with either high cholesterol (HC, n=10) or standard (S, n=10) chows for 12 weeks (protocol 1), and with HC (n=12) or S (n=10) chows for 8 weeks (protocol 2). In protocol 3, 10 rabbits were fed with various protocols to observe the effects of different serum cholesterol levels. Results showed that the serum cholesterol levels were 2097+/-288 mg/dL in HC group and 59+/-9 mg/dL in S group for protocol 1 and were 1889+/-577 mg/dL in HC group and 50+/-21 mg/dL in S group for protocol 2. Density of growth-associated protein 43- (GAP43) and  hydroxylase- (TH) positive nerves in the heart was significantly higher in HC than S in protocol 1. Compared with S, HC rabbits had longer QTc intervals, more QTc dispersion, longer action potential duration, increased heterogeneity of repolarization and higher peak calcium current (ICa) density (14.0+/-3.1 versus 9.1+/-3.4 pA/pF; P<0.01) in protocol 1 and 2. Ventricular fibrillation was either induced or occurred spontaneously in 9/12 of hearts of HC group and 2/10 of hearts in S group in protocol 2. Protocol 3 showed a strong correlation between serum cholesterol level and nerve density for GAP43 (R2=0.94; P<0.001) and TH (R2=0.91; P<0.001). We conclude that HC resulted in nerve sprouting, sympathetic hyperinnervation, and increased ICa. The neural and electrophysiological remodeling was associated with prolonged action potential duration, longer QTc intervals, increased repolarization dispersion, and increased ventricular vulnerability to fibrillation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24658819>Early onset hypercholesterolemia induced by the 2nd-generation  kinase inhibitor nilotinib in patients with chronic phase-chronic myeloid leukemia.</a></h1><p>Despite a well-recognized clinical benefit of the 2(nd)-generation  kinase inhibitor nilotinib in patients with imatinib-resistant/-intolerant or newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia, recent evidence suggests that nilotinib has a propensity to increase the risk of occlusive arterial events, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. Given the key role of lipids in cardiovascular diseases, we studied the plasma lipid profile and global cardiovascular risk prior to and during nilotinib therapy in a series of 27 patients in the setting of a prospective single center study. Data from a minimum 1-year follow up showed that nilotinib significantly increased total, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol within three months. Consequently, the proportion of patients with non-optimal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased from 48.1% to 88.9% by 12 months, leading to cholesterol-lowering drug intervention in 22.2% of patients. The proportion of patients with low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased from 40.7% to 7.4% by 12 months. In contrast, a significant decrease in triglycerides was observed. Global cardiovascular risk worsened in 11.1% of patients due to diabetes or occlusive arterial events. Whether hypercholesterolemia was the main driver of occlusive arterial events was uncertain: a longer follow up is necessary to ask whether nilotinib-induced hypercholesterolemia increases long-term risk of atherosclerotic diseases. Nevertheless, given key atherogenic properties of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, we conclude that when prescribing nilotinib, commitment to detect lipid disorders at baseline and during follow up is mandatory given their frequency, requirement for changes in lifestyle or drug intervention, and potential for long-term cardiovascular complications.Copyright© Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16613706>[A difficult and complicated case study: neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency].</a></h1><p>Neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD) is a kind of inborn errors of metabolism, with the main clinic manifestations of jaundice, hepatomegaly, and abnormal liver function indices. As a mitochondrial solute carrier protein, citrin plays important roles in aerobic glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, urea cycle, and protein and nucleotide syntheses. Therefore citrin deficiency causes various and complicated metabolic disturbances, such as hypoglycemia, hyperlactic acidemia, hyperammonemia, hypoproteinemia, , and galactosemia. This paper reported a case of NICCD confirmed by mutation analysis of SLC25A13, the gene encoding citrin. The baby (male, 6 months old) was referred to the First Affiliated Hospital with the complaint of jaundice of the skin and sclera, which it had suffered from for nearly 6 months. Physical examination showed obvious jaundice and a palpable liver 5 cm below the right subcostal margin. Liver function tests revealed elevated enzymatic activities, like GGT, ALP, AST, and ALT, together with increased levels of TBA, bilirubin (especially conjugated bilirubin), and decreased levels of total protein/albumin and fibrinogen. Blood levels of ammonia, lactate, cholesterol, and triglyceride were also increased, and in particular, the serum AFP level reached 319,225.70 microg/L, a extremely elevated value that has rarely been found in practice before. Tandem mass analysis of a dried blood sample revealed increased levels of free fatty acids and , methionine, citrulline, and threonine as well. UP-GC-MS analysis of the urine sample showed elevated galactose and galactitol. The baby was thus diagnosed with suspected NICCD based on the findings. It was then treated with oral arginine and multiple vitamins (including fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K), and was fed with lactose-free and medium-chain fatty acids enriched formula instead of breast feeding. After half a month of treatment, the jaundice disappeared, and the laboratory findings, including liver function indices, blood levels of ammonia, lactate and AFP, were returned to normal level. The baby was followed up for 6 months. It developed well, and the abnormal laboratory findings, including MS-MS and UP-GC-MS analysis results, have been corrected, except a slightly elevated lactate level sometimes. SLC25A13 gene mutation analysis for the patient revealed a compound heterozygote of mutation 851del4 and 1638ins23 and therefore NICCD was definitely diagnosed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14711185>Effects of enoxaparin and nadroparin on major cardiac events in high-risk unstable angina treated with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor.</a></h1><p>Clinical trials have reported the beneficial effects of platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists and low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) on major cardiac events (MACE) in patients presenting with unstable angina or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. A number of studies have documented the significant superiority of low-molecular-weight heparins, especially enoxaparin, over unfractionated heparin in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of two different LMWHs, enoxaparin and nadroparin, accompanied by platelet GP IIb/IIIa inhibition on MACE in high-risk unstable angina. The study was designed as an open-label and observational study. Sixty-eight patients presenting with unstable angina associated with high-risk criteria were randomly assigned to treatment with enoxaparin plus tirofiban (36 patients, mean age 57 +/- 11) or nadroparin plus tirofiban (32 patients, mean age: 58 +/- 8). In-hospital MACE including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), recurrent refractory angina, death, stroke, and urgent revascularization were compared between the study groups. Patient characteristics and durations of LMWH and tirofiban treatments were not different between the study groups. Coronary artery risk factors, except family history (which was observed more frequently in the enoxaparin group, P = 0.02), were also similar. MACE between the enoxaparin and nadroparin groups including AMI (5.5%, 6%), recurrent refractory angina (19%, 12%), death (0%, 3%), stroke (was not observed in either group), urgent revascularization (14%, 12%) and total MACE (19%, 15%) were not different. Enoxaparin and nadroparin, accompanied by GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy, have similar effects on the development of major cardiac events in patients presenting with unstable angina and high-risk characteristics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22890841>Disruption of the selenocysteine lyase-mediated selenium recycling pathway leads to metabolic syndrome in mice.</a></h1><p>Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element used for biosynthesis of selenoproteins and is acquired either through diet or cellular recycling mechanisms. Selenocysteine lyase (Scly) is the enzyme that supplies Se for selenoprotein biosynthesis via decomposition of the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). Knockout (KO) of Scly in a mouse affected hepatic glucose and lipid homeostasis. Mice lacking Scly and raised on an Se-adequate diet exhibit hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis, with increased hepatic oxidative stress, but maintain selenoprotein levels and circulating Se status. Insulin challenge of Scly KO mice results in attenuated Akt phosphorylation but does not decrease phosphorylation levels of AMP kinase alpha (AMPKα). Upon dietary Se restriction, Scly KO animals develop several characteristics of metabolic syndrome, such as obesity, fatty liver, and hypercholesterolemia, with aggravated hyperleptinemia, hyperinsulinemia, and glucose intolerance. Hepatic glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) and selenoprotein S (SelS) production and circulating selenoprotein P (Sepp1) levels are significantly diminished. Scly disruption increases the levels of insulin-signaling inhibitor PTP1B. Our results suggest a dependence of glucose and lipid homeostasis on Scly activity. These findings connect Se and energy metabolism and demonstrate for the first time a unique physiological role of Scly in an animal model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21427288>Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factors link  and a prothrombotic state.</a></h1><p>Platelet hyperactivity associated with  contributes to development of a pro-thrombotic state.

Pharmacologic inhibition of src family kinases abolished Vav1 phosphorylation by oxLDL in vitro. Coimmunoprecipitations revealed the  phosphorylated form of src kinase Fyn was associated with Vav1 in platelets exposed to oxLDL. Using a platelet aggregation assay, we demonstrated that Vav1 deficiency, Fyn deficiency, or Vav1/Vav3 deficiency protected mice from diet-induced platelet hyperactivity. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis revealed that Vav1/Vav3 deficiency significantly inhibited oxLDL-mediated integrin αIIbβIII activation of platelets costimulated with ADP. Finally, we showed with an in vivo carotid artery thrombosis model that genetic deletion of Vav1 and Vav3 together may prevent the development of occlusive thrombi in mice fed a high-fat diet. These findings implicate Vav proteins in oxLDL-mediated platelet activation and suggest that Vav family member(s) may act as critical modulators linking a prothrombotic state and .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27014908>EGFR mediates -induced renal injury via regulating inflammation and oxidative stress: the detrimental role and mechanism of EGFR activation.</a></h1><p>Previous studies have implicated inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis as key factors in the development of obesity-induced kidney diseases. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in cancer development. Recently, the EGFR pathway has been increasingly implicated in chronic cardiovascular diseases via regulating inflammation and oxidative stress. However, it is unclear if EGFR is involved in obesity-related kidney injury. Using ApoE-/- and C57BL/6 mice models and two specific EGFR inhibitors, we investigated the potential effects of EGFR inhibition in the treatment of obesity-related nephropathy and found that EGFR inhibition alleviates renal inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis. In NRK-52E cells, we also elucidated the mechanism behind -induced EGFR activation. We observed that c-Src and EGFR forms a complex, and following PA stimulation, it is the successive phosphorylation, not formation, of the c-Src/EGFR complex that results in the subsequent cascade activation. Second, we found that TLR4 regulates the activation EGFR pathway mainly through the phosphorylation of the c-Src/EGFR complex. These results demonstrate the detrimental role of EGFR in the pathogenesis of obesity-related nephropathy, provide a new understanding of the mechanism behind /FFA-induced EGFR activation, and support the use of EGFR inhibitors in the treatment of obesity-induced kidney diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27339176>Alligator pepper/Grain of Paradise (Aframomum melegueta) modulates Angiotensin-I converting enzyme activity, lipid profile and oxidative imbalances in a rat model of hypercholesterolemia.</a></h1><p>Alligator pepper [Aframomum melegueta Roscoe K. (Zingiberaceae)] seeds have been reportedly used in folkloric medicine in the management of hypercholesterolemia and hypertension with limited scientific basis for their action. This study was conducted to characterize the amino acids in Alligator pepper seeds (APS), assess their effects on lipid profile and enzyme linked to blood pressure regulation in hypercholesterolemic rat (rats fed 2% cholesterol diet) model. Free and total amino acids of APS were extracted and their various constituents were analyzed using the amino acid analyzer and ultra-performance liquid chromatography. The effect of dietary inclusion of APS (2-4%) on the lipid profile, angiotensin I-enzyme (ACE) activity and antioxidant status in hypercholesterolemic rats (HCR) for 30days was assessed. The results suggest that APS may modulate blood lipid profile, ameliorate blood pressure, attenuate hepatotoxicity and exert antihypercholesterolemic effect. γ - amino butyric acid (GABA), , phenylalanine and tryptophan that were subsequently detected in APS. The observed salutary effects of APS may be attributed to the synergistic or/and additive actions of the amino acids present with other antioxidant phytoconstituents.

The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro anti-diabetic potential of prunin via the inhibition of protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), α-glucosidase, peroxynitrite (ONOO)-mediated  nitration, and stimulation of glucose uptake in insulin-resistant hepatocytes. In addition, a molecular docking simulation was performed to predict specific prunin binding modes during PTP1B inhibition. Prunin showed strong inhibitory activity against PTP1B, with an IC value of 5.5 ± 0.29 µM, and significant inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase, with an IC value of 317 ± 2.12 µM. Moreover, a kinetics study revealed that prunin inhibited PTP1B (K  = 8.66) and α-glucosidase (K  = 189.56) with characteristics typical of competitive and mixed type inhibitors, respectively. Docking simulations showed that prunin selectively inhibited PTP1B by targeting its active site and exhibited good binding affinity, with a docking score of -9 kcal/mol. Furthermore, prunin exhibited dose-dependent inhibitory activity against ONOO-mediated  nitration and stimulated glucose uptake by decreasing PTP1B expression level in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. These results indicate that prunin has significant potential as a selective PTP1B inhibitor and may possess anti-diabetic properties by improving insulin resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24238512>Famitinib in metastatic renal cell carcinoma: a single center study.</a></h1><p>Famitinib is a novel and potent multitargeting receptor  kinase inhibitor.

The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of famitinib for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).The data of famitinib in treating patients with mRCC from the single-center phases I and II clinical trials were analyzed. Famitinib was administered orally at the dose of 13-30 mg once daily until tumor progression, occurrence of intolerable adverse reactions or withdrawal of the informed consent.A total of 24 patients with mRCC were treated including 17 patients at a dose of 25 mg once daily, 4 patients at a dose of 27 mg and 1 patient each at a dose of 13 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg, respectively. Twelve (50.0%) patients achieved partial response (PR) and 9 patients achieved stable disease (SD). Progressive disease was found in 3 (12.5%) patients. The disease control rate was 87.5%. The median follow-up time was 17.6 months; the median progression free survival (PFS) was 10.7 (95% CI 7.0-14.4) months; and the estimated median overall survival (OS) time was 33.0 (95% CI 8.7-57.3) months.

However, recent studies argue strongly against a generalized increase in diabetic oxidative stress, which might instead be confined to the vascular wall. Here, we describe a pathway for glucose-stimulated protein oxidation and provide evidence of its complicity in diabetic microvascular disease. Low density lipoprotein incubated with pathophysiological concentrations of glucose became selectively enriched in ortho- and meta-, implicating a hydroxyl radical-like species in protein damage. Model system studies demonstrated that the reaction pathway requires both a reactive carbonyl group and a polyunsaturated fatty acid, involves lipid peroxidation, and is blocked by the carbonyl scavenger aminoguanidine. To explore the physiological relevance of the pathway, we used mass spectrometry and high pressure liquid chromatography to quantify oxidation products in control and hyperglycemic rats. Hyperglycemia raised levels of ortho-, meta-, and oxygenated lipids in the retina, a tissue rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Rats that received aminoguanidine did not show this increase in protein and lipid oxidation. In contrast, rats with diet-induced  in the absence of hyperglycemia failed to exhibit increased protein and lipid oxidation products in the retina. Our observations suggest that generation of a hydroxyl radical-like species by a carbonyl/polyunsaturated fatty acid pathway might promote localized oxidative stress in tissues vulnerable to diabetic damage. This raises the possibility that antioxidant therapies that specifically inhibit the pathway might delay the vascular complications of diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15019535>Peroxynitrite-mediated oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein by aqueous extracts of cigarette smoke and the preventive effect of fluvastatin.</a></h1><p>Cigarette smoking is known to promote atherosclerosis, possibly through enhanced oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the possible involvement of peroxynitrite in oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) induced by aqueous extract of cigarette smoke (CSE) and the preventive effect of fluvastain, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor with antioxidative activity, in vitro and in vivo. Modification of LDL was monitored by LDL subfraction analysis using anion-exchange HPLC, TBARS formation and 3-nitrotyrosine production. Incubation of LDL with CSE caused a marked increase in oxidative modification of LDL and nitration of  residues in the apolipoprotein B. These modifications were prevented by treatment with fluvastatin as well as Vitamin E in a concentration-related manner. Fluvastatin was equal to or more effective than Vitamin E for preventing protein nitration, but weaker for preventing oxidative modification. When CSE was injected daily into the ear vein of Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits for 5 months, both oxidative modification and nitration of the plasma LDL noticeably occurred. These changes induced by CSE could be effectively prevented by the simultaneous oral administration of fluvastatin (10 and 30 mg/kg) or Vitamin E (150 mg/kg). Fluvastatin prevented the LDL nitration more effectively than Vitamin E. These results suggest that peroxynitrite in CSE is involved in oxidative modification of LDL and that fluvastatin can efficiently prevent LDL modification by scavenging peroxynitrite. Fluvastatin may be potentially beneficial to hypercholesterolemic patients with oxidative stress such as smoking.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17709884>Novel inhibitors of glycation and AGE formation.</a></h1><p>Accelerated formation of advanced glycation/lipoxidation and endproducts (AGEs/ALEs) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diabetic complications. Several natural and synthetic compounds have been proposed and tested as inhibitors of AGE/ALE formation. We have previously reported the therapeutic effects of several new AGE/ALE inhibitors on the prevention of nephropathy and dyslipidemia in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. In this study, we investigated the effects of various concentrations of a compound, LR-90, on the progression of renal disease and its effects on AGE and receptor for AGE (RAGE) protein expression on the kidneys of diabetic STZ-rats. Diabetic male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with or without LR-90 (0, 5, 20, 25, and 50 mg/l of drinking water). After 32 weeks, body weight, glycemic status, renal function, and plasma lipids were measured. Kidney histopathology and AGE/ALE accumulation and RAGE protein expression in tissues were also determined. In vitro studies were also performed to determine the possible mechanism of action of LR-90 in inhibiting AGE formation and AGE-protein cross-linking. LR-90 protected the diabetic kidneys by inhibiting the increase in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio and ameliorated  in diabetic rats in a concentration-dependent fashion without any effects on hyperglycemia. LR-90 treatment also reduced kidney AGE/ALE accumulation and RAGE protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner. In vitro, LR-90 exhibited general antioxidant properties by inhibiting metal-catalyzed reactions and reactive oxygen species (OH radical) and reactive carbonyl species (methlyglyoxal, glyoxal) generations without any effect on pyridoxal 5' phosphate. The compound also prevents AGE-protein cross-linking reactions. These findings demonstrate the bioefficacy of LR-90 in treating nephropathy and  in diabetic animals by inhibiting AGE accumulation, RAGE protein expression, and protein oxidation in the diabetic kidney. Additionally, our study suggests that LR-90 may be useful also to delay the onset and progression of diabetic atherosclerosis as the compound can inhibit the expression of RAGE and inflammation-related pathology, as well as prevent lipid peroxidation reactions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15309577>The relationship between plasma cholesterol, amino acids and acute phase proteins in sepsis.</a></h1><p>The purpose of the study was to correlate degree of hypocholesterolemia to changes in plasma levels of amino acids and other metabolic variables in severely injured septic patients. Measurements included plasma cholesterol, full amino-acidograms, acute phase proteins, complementary variables and blood cell counts. The Fischer plasma molar amino acid ratio (leucine+isoleucine+valine)/(phenylalanine+) was calculated. Plasma cholesterol for all measurements (n=145) was 3.1+/-1.1 mmol/L and, upon entry in the study, it was correlated inversely with sepsis severity score (p<0.05). Along the clinical course, changes in cholesterol were clearly paralleled by opposite changes in C-reactive protein, which was the best correlate of cholesterol (r2=0.70, p<0.0001). Furthermore cholesterol was inversely related to phenylalanine, fibrinogen, lactate and white blood cell count, and directly to the Fischer molar amino acid ratio, cystathionine, methionine, glycine and transferrin (r2 between 0.36 and 0.15, p<0.0001 for all). Within this pattern of correlations, cholesterol was also directly related to alkaline phosphatase, which accounted for the effect of cholestasis, when present. For any given value of the other variables, cholesterol increased significantly with increase in alkaline phosphatase (p<0.0001). C-reactive protein (CRP, mg/dl) and alkaline phosphatase (ALKPH, U/L) together in the same regression explained 79% of the variability of cholesterol (CHOL, mmol/L): CHOL=5.90-0.74[Log(e)CRP]+0.004[ALKPH]; multiple r2=0.79, p<0.0001. Inclusion in this regression of other variables did not increase the r2. By using only amino acid variables, the best fit was provided by a regression including the Fischer ratio and cystathionine, which explained 55% of the variability of cholesterol (multiple r2=0.55 p<0.0001), and this result was not improved by the inclusion of other amino acids. These data show that severity of hypocholesterolemia in sepsis is quantifiably related to changes in plasma amino acids, and to severity of acute phase response and metabolic decompensation. More study is needed to understand whether hypocholesterolemia in sepsis has only diagnostic or prognostic implications, or that it may also contribute actively to worsening of the disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27905105>Endothelin-1 (ET-1) stimulates carboxy terminal Smad2 phosphorylation in vascular endothelial cells by a mechanism dependent on ET receptors and de novo protein synthesis.</a></h1><p>G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists through their receptors can transactivate protein  kinase receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor and serine/threonine kinase receptors most notably transforming growth factor (TGF)-β receptor (TβRI).

This study addressed the role and mechanisms involved in GPCR agonist, endothelin-1 (ET-1)-mediated transactivation of the TβRI in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs).The in-vitro model used BAECs. Signalling intermediate phospho-Smad2 in the carboxy terminal was detected and quantified by Western blotting.ET-1 treatment of BAECs resulted in a time and concentration-dependent increase in pSmad2C. Peak phosphorylation was evident with 100 nm treatment of ET-1 at 4-6 h. TβRI antagonist, SB431542 inhibited ET-1-mediated pSmad2C. In the presence of bosentan, a mixed ET and ET receptor antagonist ET-1-mediated pSmad2C levels were inhibited. The ET-mediated pSmad2C was blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide.In BAECs, ET-1 via the ETB receptor is involved in transactivation of the TβRI.

The current study further evaluated the effects and possible mechanisms of QGZST on epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) dysfunction in a high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed-spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model. Results showed that QGZST significantly decreased the systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), body weights and adipocyte size of HFD-fed SHRs. Moreover, QGZST remarkably reduced the serum levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR index, increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and improved glucose intolerance in HFD-fed SHRs. Furthermore, QGZST dramatically attenuated HFD-fed-induced hypersecretion of proinflammatory cytokines and hypoproduction of adiponectin in SHRs. Mechanistically, QGZST stimulated the activity of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and suppress the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins-α(C/EBP-α), fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), acetylated nuclear factor-kappa-B-p65 (acetyl-NF-кB-p65) and protein- phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). More than that, QGZST also prevented acetyl-NF-кB-p65 nuclear accumulation. Collectively, our research demonstrated for the first time that QGZST is able to alleviate eWAT dysfunction with up-regulation of SIRT1 in HFD-fed SHRs, which might supply further insight into QGZST-mediated anti-hypertension and anti-obesity effects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Oleuropein, the main polyphenolic constituent of olives, reduced the infarct size in normal and cholesterol-fed rabbits when it was administered at a nutritional dose. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of oleuropein and preconditioning in terms of the cell signaling and metabolism pathways underlying myocardial protection. Rabbits were randomly divided into six groups: the control group received 5 % dextrose for six weeks, the preconditioning group was subjected to two cycles of preconditioning with 5 min ischemia/10 min reperfusion, the O6 group was treated with oleuropein for six weeks, the Chol group was fed a cholesterol-enriched diet and 5 % dextrose for six weeks, and the CholO6 and CholO3 groups were treated with cholesterol and oleuropein for six and three weeks, respectively; oleuropein was dissolved in 5 % dextrose solution and was administered orally at a dose of 20 mg × kg(-1) × day(-1). All animals were subsequently subjected to 30 min myocardial ischemia followed by 10 min of reperfusion. At that time, myocardial biopsies were taken from the ischemic areas for the assessment of oxidative and nitrosative stress biomarkers (malondialdehyde and nitrotyrosine), and determination of phosphorylation of signaling molecules involved in the mechanism of preconditioning (PI3K, Akt, eNOS, AMPK, STAT3). The tissue extracts NMR metabolic profile was recorded and further analyzed by multivariate statistics. Oxidative biomarkers were significantly reduced in the O6, CholO6, and CholO3 groups compared to the control, preconditioning, and Chol groups. Considering the underlying signaling cascade, the phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt, eNOS, AMPK, and STAT-3 was significantly higher in the preconditioning and all oleuropein-treated groups compared to the control and Chol groups. The NMR-based metabonomic study, performed through the analysis of spectroscopic data, depicted differences in the metabolome of the various groups with significant alterations in purine metabolism. In conclusion, the addition of oleuropein to a normal or hypercholesterolemic diet results in a preconditioning-like intracellular effect, eliminating the deleterious consequences of ischemia and hypercholesterolemia, followed by a decrease of oxidative stress biomarkers. This effect is exerted through inducing preconditioning-involved signaling transduction.

As far we don't know how many patients with new diagnosed diabetes have late complications according to presence of antibodies against islet antigens. The aim of the study was to compare late complications of diabetes: microangiopathy and macroangiopathy in newly diagnosed adult diabetic patients in relation to presence of humoral autoimmune markers.We evaluated the presence of late complications in group of 41, hospitalized patients base on clinical examination and medical history. Glutaminic acid decarboxylase antibodies (anti-GAD), protein  phosphatase antibodies (anti-IA-2) and anti-insulin antibodies (IAA) titers were measured by RIA. The C peptide basal and stimulated, HbA1c, glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, urea, creatinine levels and microalbuminuria were evaluated.The presence of islet cell specific antibodies were shown in 25 subjects. We observed late complications in 13/25 (52%) in group with positive antibodies titers, and in 10/16 (62.5%) in group without antibodies.

Lipid peroxidation, a major consequence of oxidative stress, generates highly reactive products, including hydroxy-ω-oxoalkenoic acids that modify autologous proteins generating biologically active derivatives. Phosphatidylethanolamine, the second most abundant eukaryotic phospholipid, can also be modified by hydroxy-ω-oxoalkenoic acids. However, the conditions leading to accumulation of such derivatives in circulation and their biological activities remain poorly understood. We now show that carboxyalkylpyrrole-phosphatidylethanolamine derivatives (CAP-PEs) are present in the plasma of hyperlipidemic ApoE(-/-) mice. CAP-PEs directly bind to TLR2 and induces platelet integrin αIIbβ3 activation and P-selectin expression in a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-dependent manner. Platelet activation by CAP-PEs includes assembly of TLR2/TLR1 receptor complex, induction of downstream signaling via MyD88/TIRAP, phosphorylation of IRAK4, and subsequent activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6. This in turn activates the Src family kinases, spleen  kinase and PLCγ2, and platelet integrins. Murine intravital thrombosis studies demonstrated that CAP-PEs accelerate thrombosis in TLR2-dependent manner and that TLR2 contributes to accelerate thrombosis in mice in the settings of .

Metabolites can be useful as early biomarkers and new targets to promote early intervention beginning in school age. Thus, we aimed to identify metabolomic profiles associated with obesity and obesity-related metabolic traits. We used data from the Obesity Research Study for Mexican children (ORSMEC) in Mexico City and included a case control (n = 1120), cross-sectional (n = 554) and a longitudinal study (n = 301) of 6-12-year-old children. Forty-two metabolites were measured using electrospray MS/MS and multivariate regression models were used to test associations of metabolomic profiles with anthropometric, clinical and biochemical parameters.

These associations were validated in the cross-sectional study (P < 0.0001). In the longitudinal cohort, the amino acid signature was associated with serum TG and with the risk of hypertriglyceridemia after 2 years (OR = 1.19; 95%CI 1.03-1.39, P = 0.016). This study shows that an amino acid signature significantly associated with childhood obesity, is an independent risk factor of future hypertriglyceridemia in children.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30075243>Accumulation of Cholesterol and Homocysteine in the Nigrostriatal Pathway of Brain Contributes to the Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration in Mice.</a></h1><p>Elevated levels of cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia) and homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia, HHcy) in blood have been linked with the pathology of Parkinson's disease. However, the impact of their combined effect on brain is unknown. The present study aims to investigate the effect of HHcy on dopaminergic neurons in brain of mice with hypercholesterolemia. Mice were subjected to a high-cholesterol diet for 12 weeks to develop hypercholesterolemia, and were administered with homocysteine (250 mg/kg, b.w., i.p., 60 days) daily starting from 24th day of the high-cholesterol diet for induction of HHcy. The animals were subjected to Parkinsonian motor behavioral tests and sacrificed to estimate the levels of cholesterol, homocysteine and dopamine in brain, and to assess dopaminergic neuronal status. There occurred elevation in cholesterol and homocysteine levels in nigrostriatum of hypercholesterolemic animals with HHcy. Injection of homocysteine in hypercholesterolemic mice exacerbated the motor abnormalities as well as caused depletion of striatal dopamine level significantly, which was supported by a significant decrease in  hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in striatum. While neither hypercholesterolemia nor HHcy caused significant changes in the number of TH-positive neurons, hypercholesterolemia in combination with HHcy resulted in a significant loss of nigral TH-positive neurons. The results highlighted the involvement of mitochondrial complex-I dysfunction with subsequent generation of hydroxyl radicals for the observed loss of midbrain dopamine neurons in animals receiving the combined treatment. Thus, the findings of the present study pointed out the combined effect of homocysteine and cholesterol toward dopamine neuronal dysfunctions, which has substantial relevance to Parkinson's disease.Copyright © 2018 IBRO.

The mechanisms leading to platelet hyperreactivity are complex and not yet fully understood.Platelet hyperreactivity and accelerated thrombosis, specifically in dyslipidemia, have been mechanistically linked to the accumulation in the circulation of a specific group of oxidized phospholipids (oxPC) that are ligands for the platelet pattern recognition receptor CD36. In the current article, we tested whether the platelet innate immune system contributes to responses to oxPC and accelerated thrombosis observed in .Using in vitro approaches, as well as platelets from mice with genetic deletion of MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88) or TLRs (Toll-like receptors), we demonstrate that TLR2 and TLR6 are required for the activation of human and murine platelets by oxPC. oxPC induce formation of CD36/TLR2/TLR6 complex in platelets and activate downstream signaling via TIRAP (Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain containing adaptor protein)-MyD88-IRAK (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase)1/4-TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6), leading to integrin activation via the SFK (Src family kinase)-Syk (spleen  kinase)-PLCγ2 (phospholipase Cγ2) pathway.

However, its effects on hypercholesterolemia and associated disorders have not been studied yet. The present study explored the effect of nilotinib on atherosclerosis progression, endothelial dysfunction, and -associated hepatic injury in high-cholesterol (HC)-fed rabbits. Rabbits were classified into four groups: control, nilotinib, HC, and HC + nilotinib groups. Rabbits were fed either a regular diet or an HC-enriched diet for 8 weeks. By the end of the eighth week, blood and tissue samples were obtained for biochemical, histological, immunohistochemical, and in vitro analyses. Results indicated that the HC diet induced a significant elevation in the serum lipid parameters (triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), lactate dehydrogenase, and nitric oxide content. Endothelial dysfunction was evident through the impairment of acetylcholine-induced relaxation of isolated aortas and the histopathological lesions of the aortic specimen. Moreover, HC significantly increased serum malondialdehyde. Liver damage was clear through increase in serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, and it was further supported by histopathological examination. HC increased the expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-B in both aorta and liver tissues. Interestingly, nilotinib administration retarded atherosclerosis progression and attenuated all of the aforementioned parameters. These data suggest that nilotinib may counteract atherosclerosis development, vascular dysfunction, and hepatic damage in HC-fed rabbits through interfering with PDGF-B.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16166272> attenuates the infarct size-limiting effect of ischemic preconditioning: role of matrix metalloproteinase-2 inhibition.</a></h1><p> attenuates the cardioprotective effect of preconditioning via unknown mechanisms. We have reported previously that in normolipidemic rats, preconditioning decreased ischemia-induced activation and release of myocardial matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 into the coronary perfusate. Here, we investigated whether  interferes with the cardioprotective effect of preconditioning through modulation of MMP-2. Hearts isolated from male Wistar rats fed 2% cholesterol-enriched or control chow for 9 weeks were subjected to a preconditioning protocol (three intermittent periods of ischemia/reperfusion of 5-min duration each) or a time-matched nonpreconditioning protocol. This was followed by a test ischemia/reperfusion (30-min ischemia and 120-min reperfusion) in both groups. Preconditioning decreased infarct size in the control but not the cholesterol-fed group. Cardioprotection in the preconditioned control group but not in the cholesterol-fed group was associated with an 18 +/- 3% (p < 0.05) inhibition of test ischemia/reperfusion-induced activation and release of myocardial MMP-2 into the perfusate. Myocardial protein levels of tissue inhibitors of MMPs [tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-2 and TIMP-4] were not changed in either group. A reduction of infarct size in nonpreconditioned hearts from both control and cholesterol-fed group was produced by the MMP inhibitor ilomastat at 0.25 microM, a concentration producing MMP-2 inhibition comparable with that of preconditioning in the control group. We conclude that  blocks preconditioning-induced cardioprotection,  abolishes preconditioning-induced inhibition of myocardial MMP-2 activation and release, preconditioning-induced inhibition of MMP-2 activation and release is not mediated by TIMPs, and pharmacological inhibition of MMPs produces cardioprotection in both normal and hyperlipidemic rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17692525>Mono- and disalicylic acid derivatives: PTP1B inhibitors as potential anti-obesity drugs.</a></h1><p>A series of compounds containing one or two salicylic acid moieties were synthesized, and their efficacy to inhibit the phosphohydrolase activity of PTP1B examined.

In platelets, junctional adhesion molecule (JAM)-A was previously identified as an inhibitor of integrin αIIbβ3-mediated outside-in signaling and its genetic knockdown resulted in hyperreactivity.This gain-of-function was specifically exploited to investigate the role of platelet hyperreactivity in plaque development.JAM-A-deficient platelets showed increased aggregation and cellular and sarcoma -protein kinase activation. On αIIbβ3 ligation, JAM-A was shown to be dephosphorylated, which could be prevented by protein  phosphatase nonreceptor type 1 inhibition. Mice with or without platelet-specific (tr)JAM-A-deficiency in an apolipoprotein e (apoe(-/-)) background were fed a high-fat diet. After ≤12 weeks of diet, trJAM-A(-/-)apoe-/- mice showed increased aortic plaque formation when compared with trJAM-A(+/+) apoe(-/-) controls, and these differences were most evident at early time points. At 2 weeks, the plaques of the trJAM-A(-/-) apoe(-/-) animals revealed increased macrophage, T cell, and smooth muscle cell content. Interestingly, plasma levels of chemokines CC chemokine ligand 5 and CXC-chemokine ligand 4 were increased in the trJAM-A(-/-) apoe(-/-)mice, and JAM-A-deficient platelets showed increased binding to monocytes and neutrophils. Whole-blood perfusion experiments and intravital microscopy revealed increased recruitment of platelets and monocytes to the inflamed endothelium in blood of trJAM-A(-/-) apoe(-/-)mice. Notably, these proinflammatory effects of JAM-A-deficient platelets could be abolished by the inhibition of αIIbβ3 signaling in vitro.Deletion of JAM-A causes a gain-of-function in platelets, with lower activation thresholds and increased inflammatory activities. This leads to an increase of plaque formation, particularly in early stages of the disease.© 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16198620>Insulin resistance and clinical aspects of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is one of the most common liver disorders. This is highly prevalent in obese and diabetic subjects. Persons with central obesity are at particular risk. Other clinical predictors are age more than 40-50 years and , but none of these factors is invariable for causation of NASH. Other reported associations are, celiac disease, Wilson's Disease and few other metabolic diseases. Drugs, particularly amiodarone, tamoxifen, nucleoside analogues and methotrxate have also been linked to NASH. The disease is evenly distributed in both sexes but advanced disease is more common in women. Ethnic variation exists and African Americans are less affected than Hispanic Americans. Specific clinical features of NASH are infrequent. Patients usually come to clinical attention by elevated liver enzymes found on routine evaluation but on history, about two third of patients will admit to have mild fatigue and about half will report right upper quadrant pain. Rarely, patient may present with a complication of cirrhosis. Physical examination may reveal hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Research in last few years has stressed that development of steatosis, stetohepatitis, fibrosis with subsequent cirrhosis are most probably the result of insulin resistance. Therefore, clinical features may reflect existence of insulin resistance. Obesity, particularly central obesity is most important of these. Patients may have sleep apnea syndrome. Hypertension and manifestations of diabetes mellitus like polyuria, polydypsia, and neurological deficits may occur. Patients may have varying combination of obesity, diabetes, , hypertension and impaired fibrinolysis (syndrome X). Children with insulin resistance may show acanthosis nigricance. Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, which consists of insulin resistance, diabetes, obesity, hirsutism, oligo or polymenorrha and  may have NASH. Other rare manifestations of insulin resistance, which can be seen in patients of NASH are lipomatosis, lipoatrophy/lipodystrophy and panniculitis. Most other rare conditions known to cause NASH like peroxisomal diseases, mitochondialpathies, Weber-Christian disease, Mauriac syndrome, Madelung's lipomatosis and abetaliopprotenemia also have insulin resistance. This is believed that primary defect underlying insulin resistance is impairment in postreceptor pathways (through  kinase activity) of insulin action. Primary defect in insulin receptors appear uncommon. This results in down regulation of insulin receptor substance 1 (IRS-1) signaling by excess free fatty acids. In muscle, activated IRS-1 promotes translocation of glucose transporter protein 4 (GLUT4) to cell membrane. As a result, monocyte glucose uptake by GLUT4 increases glucose disposal from blood and reduced need for insulin. PKC-0 is a likely candidate as serine kinase in muscle regulated by fatty acids that can impair the activation of IRS-1. Insulin resistance is usually evaluated by fasting insulin levels, Quantitative Insulin Check Index (QUICKI) and Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA), C-peptid/insulin ratio oral glucose tolerance test and hyper insulinemic euglycemic clamp. The clamp technique is considered the gold standard.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19011046>Chronic insulin treatment suppresses PTP1B function, induces increased PDGF signaling, and amplifies neointima formation in the balloon-injured rat artery.</a></h1><p>We tested the hypothesis that hyperinsulinemia induces the suppression of protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) function, leading to enhanced PDGF receptor (PDGFR) signaling and neointimal hyperplasia. Rats were implanted with insulin-releasing pellets or sham pellets. Blood glucose levels, insulin levels, food and water intake, body weights, and blood pressures were measured. Neointimal hyperplasia was assessed by computerized morphometry 14 days after carotid balloon injury. PTP1B protein expression in injured arteries was determined via Western blot analysis, whereas PTP1B activity was determined via an immunophosphatase assay. Serum insulin levels were two- to threefold greater in hyperinsulinemic rats, whereas systolic blood pressures, food and water intake, serum triglyceride levels, plasma cortisol levels, and urinary catecholamine levels were not affected. Fourteen days after injury, neointima-to-media area ratios were 0.89 +/- 0.23 and 1.35 +/- 0.22 in control and hyperinsulinemic rats, respectively (P < 0.01). PTP1B protein levels and total PTP1B activity in injured carotid arteries from the insulin-treated group were significantly decreased 7 or 14 days after injury, whereas PTP1B specific activity was decreased only 14 days after injury. These findings were associated with decreased PTP1B mRNA levels and increased PDGFR tyrosyl phosphorylation in insulin-treated rats. These observations support the hypothesis that hyperinsulinemia induces the suppression of PTP1B function, leading to enhanced PDGFR signaling and neointimal hyperplasia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17235396>Neuronal SH2B1 is essential for controlling energy and glucose homeostasis.</a></h1><p>SH2B1 (previously named SH2-B), a cytoplasmic adaptor protein, binds via its Src homology 2 (SH2) domain to a variety of protein  kinases, including JAK2 and the insulin receptor. SH2B1-deficient mice are obese and diabetic. Here we demonstrated that multiple isoforms of SH2B1 (alpha, beta, gamma, and/or delta) were expressed in numerous tissues, including the brain, hypothalamus, liver, muscle, adipose tissue, heart, and pancreas. Rat SH2B1beta was specifically expressed in neural tissue in SH2B1-transgenic (SH2B1(Tg)) mice. SH2B1(Tg) mice were crossed with SH2B1-knockout (SH2B1(KO)) mice to generate SH2B1(TgKO) mice expressing SH2B1 only in neural tissue but not in other tissues. Systemic deletion of the SH2B1 gene resulted in metabolic disorders in SH2B1(KO) mice, including , leptin resistance, hyperphagia, obesity, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. Neuron-specific restoration of SH2B1beta not only corrected the metabolic disorders in SH2B1(TgKO) mice, but also improved JAK2-mediated leptin signaling and leptin regulation of orexigenic neuropeptide expression in the hypothalamus. Moreover, neuron-specific overexpression of SH2B1 dose-dependently protected against high-fat diet-induced leptin resistance and obesity. These observations suggest that neuronal SH2B1 regulates energy balance, body weight, peripheral insulin sensitivity, and glucose homeostasis at least in part by enhancing hypothalamic leptin sensitivity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25531053>Elevated plasma dityrosine in patients with  compared to healthy individuals.</a></h1><p>Dityrosine, the modification of  residues, may contribute to metabolic disorders. This study was undertaken to investigate plasma dityrosine concentrations in patients with  and to examine the correlation between dityrosine and lipid profiles.Fluorescence spectrophotometry was used to measure dityrosine in the plasma of healthy subjects (n = 203) and dyslipidemic subjects, which included patients with mild  (n = 246) and  (n = 179). Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were also assayed in all subjects.Dityrosine levels were higher by 9.3 and 22.9% in mildly hyperlipidemic and hyperlipidemic patients, respectively, compared to controls after adjustment for age, gender, and BMI. AOPP and MDA levels showed similar trends. The levels of dityrosine related positively (p < 0.05) to total cholesterol (r = 0.362), triglycerides (r = 0.449), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.359). Moreover, plasma dityrosine (r = 0.408), AOPP (r = 0.488), and MDA (r = 0.181) levels were elevated with an increase in the atherosclerosis index in the subjects.These findings suggest that dityrosine formation may be an early event in the pathological process of .

In this report, we show that apolipoprotein E (apoE)-CD16 double knockout (DKO; apoE-CD16 DKO) mice have reduced atherosclerotic lesions compared with apoE knockout mice. In vivo and in vitro foam cell analyses showed apoE-CD16 DKO macrophages accumulated less neutral lipids. Reduced foam cell formation in apoE-CD16 DKO mice is not due to change in expression of CD36, SR-A, and LOX-1. This led to a hypothesis that CD16 may have scavenger receptor activity. We presented evidence that a soluble form of recombinant mouse CD16 (sCD16) bound to malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein (MDALDL), and this binding is blocked by molar excess of MDA- modified BSA and anti-MDA mAbs, suggesting CD16 specifically recognizes MDA epitopes. Interestingly, sCD16 inhibited MDALDL binding to macrophage cell line, as well as soluble forms of recombinant mouse CD36, SR-A, and LOX-1, indicating CD16 can cross-block MDALDL binding to other scavenger receptors. Anti-CD16 mAb inhibited immune complex binding to sCD16, whereas it partially inhibited MDALDL binding to sCD16, suggesting MDALDL binding site may be in close proximity to the immune complex binding site in CD16. Loss of CD16 expression resulted in reduced levels of MDALDL-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression. Finally, CD16-deficient macrophages showed reduced MDALDL-induced Syk phosphorylation. Collectively, our findings suggest scavenger receptor activity of CD16 may, in part, contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2014 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17852078>Characterization of oxidative stress in blood from diabetic vs. hypercholesterolaemic patients, using a novel synthesized marker.</a></h1><p>In the present study, we extend our novel concept of designing and using exogenous markers for the characterization of oxidative stress (OS) and OS-associated diseases. The aim was to use such a synthetic compound as a tool for studying OS in blood from diabetic and hypercholesterolaemic (Hc) patients. The marker used N-linoleoyl  (LT) was constructed from  and linoleic acid (LA); both components are known to be easily oxidized upon exposure to different types of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), and to generate specific oxidized products, depending on the type of oxidants present in vivo. Using the LT probe, we showed that the ratios of oxidized LT to total LT (Ox-LT/LT) is significantly higher in blood samples obtained from diabetic patients, than in Hc patients or healthy control subjects. LC/MS analysis revealed that blood from diabetic patients oxidizes the marker with predominant formation of Ox-LT hydroperoxide (LT-OOH) and epoxide (epoxy-LT), where the LA moiety is oxidized to hydroperoxide and to epoxide, respectively. Analysis of oxysterol levels in these samples (GC/MS) revealed that the blood of both diabetic and Hc patients contained significantly more oxysterols than blood of control subjects. Consumption of pomegranate juice by diabetic patients for 3 months suppressed their blood capacity to oxidize the LT and similarly also reduced their blood oxysterol/total cholesterol ratio by 93%. The use of an exogenous marker to characterize OS in blood samples yields important information on the extent of OS, and can provide a fingerprint for the early identification of different pathological conditions associated with OS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22778074>Diphenyl diselenide protects against metabolic disorders induced by acephate acute exposure in rats.</a></h1><p>The present study investigated the effect of diphenyl diselenide [(PhSe)2 ] on metabolic disorders induced by acephate acute exposure in rats.

Evidence suggests that postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia induce endothelial dysfunction through oxidative stress; however, the distinct role of these two factors is a matter of debate.Thirty type 2 diabetic patients and 20 normal subjects ate 3 different meals: a high-fat meal; 75 g glucose alone; and high-fat meal plus glucose. Glycemia, triglyceridemia, nitrotyrosine, and endothelial function were assayed during the tests. Subsequently, diabetics took 40 mg/d simvastatin or placebo for 12 weeks. The 3 tests were performed again at baseline, between 3 to 6 days after the start, and at the end of each study. High-fat load and glucose alone produced a decrease of endothelial function and an increase of nitrotyrosine in normal and diabetic subjects. These effects were more pronounced when high fat and glucose were combined. Short-term simvastatin treatment had no effect on lipid parameters but reduced the effect on endothelial function and nitrotyrosine observed during each different test. Long-term simvastatin treatment was accompanied by a lower increase in postprandial triglycerides, which was followed by smaller variations of endothelial function and nitrotyrosine during the tests.This study shows an independent and cumulative effect of postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia on endothelial function, suggesting oxidative stress as common mediator of such effect. Simvastatin shows a beneficial effect on oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, which may be ascribed to a direct effect as well as the lipid-lowering action of the drug.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28095303>Gd-DTPA-induced dynamic metabonomic changes in rat biofluids.</a></h1><p>The purposes of this study were (1) to detect the dynamic metabonomic changes induced by gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) and (2) to investigate the potential metabolic disturbances associated with the pathogenesis of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) at the early stage.A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics approach was used to investigate the urinary and serum metabolic changes induced by a single tail vein injection of Gd-DTPA (dosed at 2 and 5mmol/kg body weight) in rats.

Biosynthesis of cholesterol takes place by the isoprenoid pathway, which also produces digoxin, an inhibitor of membrane Na(+)-K+ ATPase. Inhibition of this enzyme results in intracellular Mg++ deficiency which can influence cholesterol metabolism. Digoxin also influences transport of tryptophan and  which are precursors of various neurotransmitters. Alterations in digoxin, membrane Na(+)-K+ ATPase and also in neurotransmitters have been reported in the disorders mentioned above. In view of this, serum lipid profile, activity of plasma HMG CoA reductase (the major rate limiting step in the isoprenoid pathway), RBC membrane Na(+)-K+ ATPase activity, serum Mg++ concentration, concentration of digoxin and concentration of serum neurotransmitters were studied in some neuropsychiatric disorders. The serum serotonin level was increased while that of serum dopamine and noradrenaline was reduced. Serum digoxin levels were high and RBC membrane sodium-potasium ATPase activity and serum magnesium were reduced. There was a reduction in HDL cholesterol and increase in plasma triglycerides (pattern similar to insulin resistance and syndrome X) in most of the disorders studied. The HMG CoA reductase activity was high, the serum total cholesterol was increased while RBC membrane cholesterol was reduced in most of the cases. The significance of increased digoxin with consequent inhibition of membrane Na(+)-K+ ATPase in relation to changes in cholesterol metabolism and insulin resistance type of dyslipidemia is discussed in this paper.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20222050>Curcumin inhibits hepatic protein- phosphatase 1B and prevents hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis in fructose-fed rats.</a></h1><p>High consumption of dietary fructose is an important contributory factor in the development of hepatic steatosis in insulin or leptin resistance. We investigated the effects of curcumin on fructose-induced hypertriglyceridemia and liver steatosis and explored its preventive mechanisms in rats. Curcumin reduced serum insulin and leptin levels in fructose-fed rats. This compound could increase phosphorylation of insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 to enhance Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) activation in the liver of fructose-fed rats. Moreover, curcumin increased phosphorylation of hepatic janus-activated kinase-signal transducer 2 and subsequently also stimulated Akt and ERK1/2 activation in this model. Suppression of curcumin on leptin signaling overstimulation in tyrosine1138 phosphorylation of the long form of leptin receptor and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 resulted in down-regulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 in the liver of fructose-fed rats. Thus, improvement of insulin and leptin signaling transduction and subsequently elevation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha expression by curcumin led to reduction of very-low-density lipoprotein overproduction and triglyceride hypersynthesis. Furthermore, overexpression and hyperactivity of hepatic protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) associated with defective insulin and leptin signaling were observed in fructose-fed rats. Additionally, curcumin was found to significantly reduce hepatic PTP1B expression and activity in this model.Our data indicate that the mechanisms by which curcumin protects against fructose-induced hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis are its inhibition on PTP1B and subsequently improvement of insulin and leptin sensitivity in the liver of rats. This PTP1B inhibitory property may be a promising therapeutic strategy for curcumin to treat fructose-induced hepatic steatosis driven by hepatic insulin and leptin resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12808344>Persistence of the nitric oxide pathway in the aorta of hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein-E-deficient mice.</a></h1><p>The markers of the bioavailability of NO (endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine and cyclic GMP content) in the thoracic aorta of apolipoprotein-E-deficient (ApoE KO) mice, 20 weeks old with enriched cholesterol diet or 35 weeks old on regular chow, are not decreased, in contrast with other models of atherosclerosis. However, severe hypercholesterolemia, the presence of atherosclerotic lesions and increased NADPH oxidase activity have been reported as early as at 20 weeks of age. The present experiments were designed to test if an increased capacity of NO production in these mice explains this paradox. The expressions of the 3 isoforms of NO synthase (NOS) were compared in ApoE KO and C57Bl/6J mice using Western blot and localized by immunohistochemistry. No adaptive increase in the expression of NOS was detected in ApoE KO mice. NO bioavailability could also be preserved by upregulation of enzymes involved in redox status such as CuZn or Mn superoxide dismutase and catalase. However, these enzymes were less expressed in ApoE KO mice than in control mice. These results highlight that ApoE KO mice represent an atypical model of atherosclerosis.Copyright 2003 S.

Growing evidence indicates that Ang II induces its pleiotropic vascular effects through NADPH-driven generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS function as important intracellular and intercellular second messengers to modulate many downstream signaling molecules, such as protein  phosphatases, protein  kinases, transcription factors, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and ion channels. Induction of these signaling cascades leads to VSMC growth and migration, regulation of endothelial function, expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, and modification of extracellular matrix. In addition, ROS increase intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), a major determinant of vascular reactivity. ROS influence signaling molecules by altering the intracellular redox state and by oxidative modification of proteins. In physiological conditions, these events play an important role in maintaining vascular function and integrity. Under pathological conditions ROS contribute to vascular dysfunction and remodeling through oxidative damage. The present review focuses on the biology of ROS in Ang II signaling in vascular cells and discusses how oxidative stress contributes to vascular damage in cardiovascular disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29606008>Mulberry Polyphenol Extract Inhibits FAK/Src/PI3K Complex and Related Signaling To Regulate the Migration in A7r5 Cells.</a></h1><p>Atherosclerosis is characterized by the buildup of plaque inside arteries. Our recent studies demonstrated that polyphenolic natural products can reduce oxidative stress, inflammation, angiogenesis, , and hyperglycemia. A previous study also showed that mulberry water extract (MWE) can inhibit atherosclerosis and contains considerable amounts of polyphenols. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether mulberry polyphenol extract (MPE) containing high levels of polyphenolic compounds could affect vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC; A7r5 cell) motility. We found that MPE inhibited expression of FAK, Src, PI3K, Akt, c-Raf, and suppressed FAK/Src/PI3K interaction. Further investigations showed that MPE reduced expression of small GTPases (RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1) to affect F-actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, down-regulated expression of MMP2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA through NFκB signaling, and thereby inhibited A7r5 cell migration. Taken together, these findings highlight MPE inhibited migration in VSMC through FAK/Src/PI3K signaling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20066537>Simvastatin in contrast to postconditioning reduces infarct size  in hyperlipidemic rabbits: possible role of oxidative/nitrosative  stress attenuation.</a></h1><p>Postconditioning (POC) reduces lethal reperfusion injury under normal conditions, but its effectiveness under certain pathological states is in dispute. In the present study, we sought to determine the effect of chronic simvastatin treatment in hyperlipidemic animals with or without POC. Anesthetized rabbits were randomized into eight groups, as follows, and were subjected to 30-min myocardial ischemia followed by 3-h reperfusion. Normally fed animals: a Control group with no additional intervention, a Sim group treated with simvastatin for 3 weeks at a dose of 3 mg kg(-1), a POC group subjected to POC with eight cycles of 30-s ischemia/reperfusion, a Sim-POC group treated with simvastatin, and POC. Cholesterol fed (6 weeks) animals: a Chol group with no additional interventions, a Chol-Sim group treated with simvastatin for 3 weeks, a Chol-POC group subjected to POC, and a Chol-Sim-POC group treated with simvastatin and POC. Infarct size and plasma levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrotyrosine (NT), NOx, total cholesterol, and LDL were evaluated. In a second series of experiments, heart tissue samples were taken for MDA, NT, and NOx assessment. Infarct size, circulating MDA, NT, NOx and cardiac MDA, NT, and NOx levels declined in POC and all Sim groups compared with Control, Chol, and Chol-POC (p < 0.05). Simvastatin also reduced total cholesterol and LDL plasma levels. In conclusion, a 3-week simvastatin treatment limits the infarct size and attenuates the oxidative and nitrosative stress both in normo- and in hyper-cholesterolemic rabbits subjected to ischemia-reperfusion irrespective of the presence of POC, while POC is effective only in normocholesterolemic animals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15186944>Modulations of shear stress-induced contractile responses and agonist-induced vasodilation in hypercholesterolemic rats.</a></h1><p>We used mesenteric arterial beds from normal rats and beef tallow-fed rats (hypercholesterolemic model) to study the interaction between the effects of viscosity-induced shear stress and agonists mesenteric vasoreactivity. Mesenteric arterial beds were perfused under constant-flow conditions (5 ml/min) via a peristaltic pump using warm oxygenated modified Krebs-Henseleit solution containing either 4% BSA to increase viscosity or 300 microM L-arginine, a NO synthase substrate. Whether beds were perfused with BSA alone or L-arginine alone as pretreatment, the methoxamine-induced contractile responses were similar to those in normal beds. However, methoxamine-induced contractile responses were significantly reduced following pretreatment with L-arginine plus BSA. These reduced responses underwent significant recovery when either tyrphostin A23 (30 microM, a  kinase inhibitor) or wortmannin (300 nM, a PI3K inhibitor) was present. The dose-response curve for methoxamine was shifted to the right and the maximum contractile response was reduced in mesenteric arterial beds from beef tallow-fed rats, but the modulation of this response induced by L-arginine plus BSA was preserved. In beef tallow-fed rats, the ACh-induced endothelium-dependent vasodilation was attenuated in both thoracic aortic strips and mesenteric arterial beds. These results suggest that in hypercholesterolemic rats, agonist-induced endothelial function is impaired, while shear stress-induced responses ( kinase- and PI3K-mediated NO production) are preserved. These abnormal vascular responses may contribute to hypertension in beef tallow-fed hypercholesterolemic model rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27338465>Amino Acid and Biogenic Amine Profile Deviations in an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test: A Comparison between Healthy and  Individuals Based on Targeted Metabolomics.</a></h1><p> (HLP) is characterized by a disturbance in lipid metabolism and is a primary risk factor for the development of insulin resistance (IR) and a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. The aim of this work was to investigate the changes in postprandial amino acid and biogenic amine profiles provoked by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in HLP patients using targeted metabolomics. We used ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry to analyze the serum amino acid and biogenic amine profiles of 35 control and 35 HLP subjects during an OGTT. The amino acid and biogenic amine profiles from 30 HLP subjects were detected as independent samples to validate the changes in the metabolites. There were differences in the amino acid and biogenic amine profiles between the HLP individuals and the healthy controls at baseline and after the OGTT. The per cent changes of 13 metabolites from fasting to the 2 h samples during the OGTT in the HLP patients were significantly different from those of the healthy controls. The lipid parameters were associated with the changes in valine, isoleucine, creatine, creatinine, dimethylglycine, asparagine, serine, and  (all p < 0.05) during the OGTT in the HLP group. The postprandial changes in isoleucine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) during the OGTT were positively associated with the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; all p < 0.05) in the HLP group. Elevated oxidative stress and disordered energy metabolism during OGTTs are important characteristics of metabolic perturbations in HLP. Our findings offer new insights into the complex physiological regulation of metabolism during the OGTT in HLP.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26519532>CD11c/CD18 Signals Very Late Antigen-4 Activation To Initiate Foamy Monocyte Recruitment during the Onset of Hypercholesterolemia.</a></h1><p>Recruitment of foamy monocytes to inflamed endothelium expressing VCAM-1 contributes to the development of plaque during atherogenesis. Foamy CD11c(+) monocytes arise in the circulation during the onset of hypercholesterolemia and recruit to nascent plaque, but the mechanism of CD11c/CD18 and very late Ag-4 (VLA-4) activation and cooperation in shear-resistant cell arrest on VCAM-1 are ill defined. Within 1 wk of the onset of a Western high-fat diet (WD) in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, an inflammatory subset of foamy monocytes emerged that made up one fourth of the circulating population. These cells expressed ∼3-fold more CD11c/CD18 and 50% higher chemokine receptors than nonfoamy monocytes. Recruitment from blood to a VCAM-1 substrate under shear stress was assessed ex vivo using a unique artery-on-a-chip microfluidic assay. It revealed that foamy monocytes from mice on a WD increased their adhesiveness over 5 wk, rising to twice that of mice on a normal diet or CD11c(-/-) mice fed a WD. Shear-resistant capture of foamy human or mouse monocytes was initiated by high-affinity CD11c, which directly activated VLA-4 adhesion via phosphorylated spleen  kinase and paxillin within focal adhesion complexes. Lipid uptake and activation of CD11c are early and critical events in signaling VLA-4 adhesive function on foamy monocytes competent to recruit to VCAM-1 on inflamed arterial endothelium.Copyright © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15928604>[The role of protein  phosphatase (PTP-1B) in insulin resistance].</a></h1><p>Insulin resistance plays an important role in the development of such abnormalities as impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and . The rates of these diseases are increasing and their cardiovascular complications are among the most common causes of death worldwide. The discovery of protein  phosphatase (PTP-1B) seems to be a milestone in the investigation of insulin signaling transmission. PTP-1B is considered a negative regulator of insulin signaling, mainly through insulin receptor dephosphorylation. In animal model studies (Elchebly et al.) there was a significant increase in insulin sensitivity of PTP-1B knock-out mice. There is also evidence that higher expression of the PTP-1B gene causes insulin resistance in humans. PTP-1B inhibitors could thus be promising drugs for insulin resistance therapy. The object of this review is to present current evidence of PTP-1B's role in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance abnormalities and the potential treatment of these disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20722490>Pleural/pericardic effusions during dasatinib treatment: incidence, management and risk factors associated to their development.</a></h1><p>Despite the beneficial effect of imatinib treatment in chronic myeloid leukemia patients, some patients develop resistance and/or intolerance and need a switch to second-generation  kinase inhibitors. Dasatinib is indicated for chronic myeloid leukemia patients with resistance or intolerance to imatinib; it has 325-fold increase potency compared to imatinib and is active in mutated and unmutated resistant patients. Pleural/pericardic effusions are frequent complications during treatment with dasatinib, and usually are reported to require dose reduction or drug discontinuation. Changing the dasatinib regimen from 70 mg twice daily to 100 mg once daily reduces the risk of pleural effusions.In this article, we review the incidence of the phenomenon observed in different dasatinib trials (Phase I - III) and the currently suggested management. We also describe the identified pathogenetic mechanisms related to the development and discuss the associated risk factors.The aim of this paper is to provide healthcare professionals with clear guidance on the management of pleural effusions associated with dasatinib treatment. Recommendations are based on the published data and clinical experience from a number of different centers.Literature evidences support the fact that with adequate management and monitoring of patients with predisposing factors, pleural effusions can be easily managed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15550530>Differential effects of exercise on aortic mitochondria.</a></h1><p>Routine exercise is widely recognized as cardioprotective. Exercise induces a variety of effects within the cardiovasculature, including decreased mitochondrial damage and improved aerobic capacity. It has been generally thought that the transient increase in oxidative stress associated with exercise initiates cardioprotective processes. Somewhat paradoxically, increased oxidative stress associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors is thought to play an important role in the promotion and development of CVD. Hence, it is possible that CVD risk factors that increase oxidative stress (e.g., hypercholesterolemia) may modulate the cardioprotective effects of exercise. In this regard, the interaction between CVD risk factors and exercise on atherosclerotic lesion development and basal oxidant load is less defined. To determine the influence of preexistent hypercholesterolemia on cardioprotective effects of exercise, atherosclerotic lesion formation, oxidant load, mitochondrial damage, protein nitration (3-nitrotyrosine levels), and mitochondrial enzyme activities were determined in aortic tissues from normocholesterolemic (C57 control) and hypercholesterolemic [apoliprotein E-deficient (apoE(-/-))] mice after 16 wk of regular exercise. In normocholesterolemic mice, regular exercise was associated with decreased mitochondrial damage and oxidant load and increased SOD2 and adenine nucleotide translocator activities. Exercise did not decrease endogenous oxidant load and mitochondrial damage in hypercholesterolemic mice and did not reduce atherosclerotic lesion development. These data are consistent with the notion that CVD risk factors associated with increased oxidative stress can alter the benefits of exercise and that mitochondrial damage appears to be correlated with the cardiovascular effects of exercise.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28189040>An anti-αVβ3 antibody inhibits coronary artery atherosclerosis in diabetic pigs.</a></h1><p>Diabetes is a major risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. Hyperglycemia stimulates vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) to secrete ligands that bind to the αVβ3 integrin, a receptor that regulates VSMC proliferation and migration. This study determined whether an antibody that had previously been shown to block αVβ3 activation and to inhibit VSMC proliferation and migration in vitro, inhibited the development of atherosclerosis in diabetic pigs.Twenty diabetic pigs were maintained on a high fat diet for 22 weeks. Ten received injections of anti-β3 F(ab) and ten received control F(ab) for 18 weeks.The active antibody group showed reduction of atherosclerosis of 91 ± 9% in the left main, 71 ± 11%, in left anterior descending, 80 ± 10.2% in circumflex, and 76 ± 25% in right coronary artery, (p < 0.01 compared to lesions areas from corresponding control treated arteries). There were significant reductions in both cell number and extracellular matrix. Histologic analysis showed neointimal hyperplasia with macrophage infiltration, calcifications and cholesterol clefts. Antibody treatment significantly reduced number of macrophages contained within lesions, suggesting that this change contributed to the decrease in lesion cellularity. Analysis of the biochemical changes within the femoral arteries that received the active antibody showed a 46 ± 12% (p < 0.05) reduction in the  phosphorylation of the β3 subunit of αVβ3 and a 40 ± 14% (p < 0.05) reduction in MAP kinase activation.Blocking ligand binding to the αVβ3 integrin inhibits its activation and attenuates increased VSMC proliferation that is induced by chronic hyperglycemia. These changes result in significant decreases in atherosclerotic lesion size in the coronary arteries. The results suggest that this approach may have efficacy in treating the proliferative phase of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Several researchers have identified mutations of ARH that cause autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia; however, it remains unknown whether this gene is involved in common hypercholesterolemia.We searched for polymorphisms of the ARH gene by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing. We identified 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms of the gene, including 9 novel polymorphisms, and determined 2 haplotype blocks. No association was observed between common hypercholesterolemia and any polymorphisms or haplotypes of the ARH gene; however, we newly identified a rare Thr56Met missense mutation located in the phosphotyrosine-binding domain, which is the functional domain responsible for cholesterol metabolism. Among 1,800 Japanese individuals enrolled in the Suita study, only 4 were heterozygous for Thr56Met and all had hypercholesterolemia. The total cholesterol level and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of diabetic patients with the Thr56Met missense mutation was 276.3+/-13.8 mg/dL and 185.3+/-7.37 mg/dL, respectively.Because the Thr56Met missense mutation occurs in an orthologously conserved functional domain and all subjects with the mutation had hypercholesterolemia resembling familiar hypercholesterolemia, it may be a cause of familial hypercholesterolemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23064124>Discovery of novel glitazones incorporated with phenylalanine and : synthesis, antidiabetic activity and structure-activity relationships.</a></h1><p>We report a series of new glitazones incorporated with phenylalanine and .

Most GISTs harbor oncogenic mutations in either the KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA)  kinase receptor genes and show differentiation along the lines of the interstitial cells of Cajal. Rarely, GISTs arise primarily in the omentum, mesentery, or retroperitoneum, at which sites they are referred to as "extragastrointestinal stromal tumors" (EGISTs). However, primary intrathoracic GIST arising in the pleura or lung has not been previously reported. We describe herein, a 62-year-old male who presented with a pleural-based mass unrelated to the esophagus that was morphologically typical of a spindle-cell GIST, showing strong immunoreactivity for KIT and DOG1, and harboring an exon 11 mutation in KIT. Ten years after resection, the tumor recurred as multiple masses in the pleura and mediastinum and was marginally reexcised. The patient was then treated with adjuvant imatinib mesylate with no evidence of further recurrences 13 months later. This seems to be the first EGIST arising above the diaphragm.

Here, we report the therapeutic effect of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), on hypertension + -induced HFpEF in a pig model.HFpEF pigs were established by infusing a combination of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) and angiotensin II (Ang II), and Western diet (WD) feeding for 18 weeks. In the 9th week, half of the HFpEF pigs were randomly assigned to receive additional dapagliflozin treatment (10 mg/day) by oral gavage daily for the next 9 weeks. Blood pressure, lipid levels, echocardiography and cardiac hemodynamics for cardiac structural and functional changes, as well as epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations in the plasma and tissues were measured. After sacrifice, cardiac fibrosis, the distribution of  hydroxylase (TH), inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-α) and NO-cGMP-PKG pathway activity in the cardiovascular system were also determined.Blood pressure, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were markedly increased in HFpEF pigs, but only blood pressure was significantly decreased after 9 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment. By echocardiographic and hemodynamic assessment, dapagliflozin significantly attenuated heart concentric remodeling in HFpEF pigs, but failed to improve diastolic function and compliance with the left ventricle (LV). In the dapagliflozin treatment group, TH expression and norepinephrine concentration in the aorta were strongly mitigated compared to that in the HFpEF group. Moreover, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α in aortic tissue were markedly elevated in HFpEF pigs and inhibited by dapagliflozin. Furthermore, the reduced expression of eNOS and the PKG-1 protein and the cGMP content in the aortas of HFpEF pigs were significantly restored after 9 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment.9 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment decreases hypertension and reverses LV concentric remodeling in HFpEF pigs partly by restraining sympathetic tone in the aorta, leading to inhibition of the inflammatory response and NO-cGMP-PKG pathway activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17134956>Effects of rosuvastatin on 3-nitrotyrosine and aortic stiffness in hypercholesterolemia.</a></h1><p>Early atherosclerosis is characterized by reduced large artery distensibility, paralleled by an increased peroxynitrite formation and nitration of  in proteins. The aim of the present study was to investigate the short-term effect of cholesterol lowering with rosuvastatin on 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), a marker of peroxynitrite-mediated oxidative stress, and on arterial stiffness.71 outpatients with primary hypercholesterolemia were recruited for this randomized open-label intervention study; 35 patients were assigned to 4-week rosuvastatin therapy (10mg daily) with a low-fat diet, and 36 patients to a low-fat diet only. Within the cohort of 71 hypercholesterolemic patients, there was a significant correlation between cholesterol levels, 3-NT and aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV), that is a reliable measure of aortic stiffness. Among those patients who received rosuvastatin, significant reductions in plasma cholesterol, 3-NT and aPWV were observed. Reductions in both aPWV and 3-NT levels correlated significantly with the decrease in plasma cholesterol. Reduction of plasma cholesterol was the only independent predictor for reduced arterial stiffness following rosuvastatin therapy.Cholesterol reduction achieved following short-term rosuvastatin therapy is associated with a decrease in peroxynitrite-mediated oxidative stress and an improvement in large artery distensibility; reduction in arterial stiffness is directly attributable to rosuvastatin-induced cholesterol lowering and not to reduction of plasma 3-NT levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12589154>Platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibition reduces allograft arteriosclerosis of heart and aorta in cholesterol-fed rabbits.</a></h1><p>Crosstalk between pro-inflammatory cytokines and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) regulates smooth-muscle-cell proliferation in cardiac-allograft arteriosclerosis. In this study, we tested the effect of STI 571, a novel orally active protein  kinase (PTK) inhibitor selective for PDGF receptor (PDGF-R) on transplant and accelerated arteriosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic rabbits.Cardiac allografts were transplanted heterotopically from Dutch Belted to New Zealand White rabbits. A 0.5% cholesterol diet was begun 4 days before transplantation. Recipients received STI 571 5 mg/kg per day or vehicle intraperitoneally throughout the study period of 6 weeks. Cyclosporine A was given as background immunosuppression.In cardiac allografts of vehicle-treated rabbits, 76.2+/-2.1% of medium-sized arteries were affected by intimal thickening, and the percentage of arterial occlusion was 45.0+/-5.0%. Treatment with STI 571 reduced the incidence of affected medium-sized arteries to 41.2+/-8.1% (P <0.05) and the arterial occlusion to 27.6+/-5.0% ( P<0.05). In addition, we observed that STI 571 treatment reduced intimal lesion formation in proximal ascending aorta of transplanted hearts from 72.3+/-19.9 to 12.7+/-1.9 microm ( P<0.05). Our results also show that STI 571 significantly inhibited accelerated arteriosclerosis in medium-sized arteries of recipients' own hearts.The results of the present study suggest that PDGF-R activation may regulate the development of transplant and accelerated arteriosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic rabbits.

Several compounds have been developed as inhibitors of AGE/ALE formation. We examined the effects of two new AGE/ALE inhibitors, LR-9 and LR-74, on the development of early renal disease and lipid metabolism in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.Diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with either of the LR compounds for 32 weeks. Progression of renal disease was evaluated by measurements of urinary albumin and plasma creatinine concentrations. AGE/ALE and nitrotyrosine levels in kidneys were determined by immunohistochemistry. AGE-induced chemical modification of the tail tendon collagen and levels of Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl) and (carboxyethyl)- lysines (CML and CEL) in skin collagen were measured. Plasma lipids and their lipid hydroperoxide concentrations were also determined. In vitro, both compounds were tested for inhibiting lipid peroxidation reactions.Treatment of either LR compounds significantly inhibited the increase in albuminuria, creatinaemia,  and lipid peroxidation in diabetic rats without any effect on hyperglycaemia. Both compounds also reduced CML-AGE and nitrotyrosine accumulation in kidney glomeruli and tubules, AGE-linked fluorescence and cross-linking of tail collagen, and levels of CML and CEL in skin collagen. In vitro, LR compounds inhibited the oxidation of human low-density lipoprotein (LDL).Both compounds can inhibit the progression of renal disease and also prevent dyslipidaemia in type-1 diabetic animals. These compounds may have an additional beneficial effect as an antioxidant against lipid peroxidation, and thus may provide alternative therapeutic options for the treatment of various diabetic macrovascular complications.Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23274953>p-Cresyl sulfate promotes insulin resistance associated with CKD.</a></h1><p>The mechanisms underlying the insulin resistance that frequently accompanies CKD are poorly understood, but the retention of renally excreted compounds may play a role. One such compound is p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), a protein-bound uremic toxin that originates from  metabolism by intestinal microbes. Here, we sought to determine whether PCS contributes to CKD-associated insulin resistance. Administering PCS to mice with normal kidney function for 4 weeks triggered insulin resistance, loss of fat mass, and ectopic redistribution of lipid in muscle and liver, mimicking features associated with CKD. Mice treated with PCS exhibited altered insulin signaling in skeletal muscle through ERK1/2 activation. In addition, exposing C2C12 myotubes to concentrations of PCS observed in CKD caused insulin resistance through direct activation of ERK1/2. Subtotal nephrectomy led to insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in mice, and treatment with the prebiotic arabino-xylo-oligosaccharide, which reduced serum PCS by decreasing intestinal production of p-cresol, prevented these metabolic derangements. Taken together, these data suggest that PCS contributes to insulin resistance and that targeting PCS may be a therapeutic strategy in CKD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16622303>Effects of pioglitazone vs glibenclamide on postprandial increases in glucose and triglyceride levels and on oxidative stress in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.</a></h1><p>To investigate the relationship between insulin resistance, postprandial hyperglycemia, postprandial , and oxidative stress in type 2 diabetes, changes in postprandial glucose, triglyceride, and nitrotyrosine levels vs baseline after diet loading were examined in type 2 diabetic patients given pioglitazone (PG) or glibenclamide (GB). Twenty-four outpatients with type 2 diabetes treated with oral PG for 6 mo (BMI, 26.3 +/- 0.9; HbA1c, 8.2 +/- 0.2%) and 10 type 2 diabetic patients treated with GB (BMI, 27.4 +/- 1.6; HbA1c, 8.1 +/- 0.2%) at our institutions were compared. These patients were given meal tolerance tests (MTT; each consisting of energy 400 kcal, protein 8.7 g, fat 22.4 g, carbohydrate 41 g) before and 6 mo after administration of either agent. PG produced a significant decrease in FPG, HbA1c, HOMA-R, and TG levels in the subjects compared to baseline. In contrast, GB significantly decreased FPG and HbA1c levels, while not affecting HOMA-R and TG values. While PG produced a significant increase in LPL, HDL-cholesterol, and adiponectin levels, GB did not affect these values. At MTT 6 mo after PG administration, insulin levels before and 4 h after MTT, free fatty acid (FFA) levels 1, 2, and 4 h after MTT, glucose, TG, and RLP-TG levels before and 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after MTT were significantly decreased compared to baseline. At MTT 6 mo after GB administration, while a significant decrease in fasting and 2 h, postprandial glucose values compared to baseline MTT levels was observed, fasting and postprandial TG and RLP-TG levels remained unchanged compared to baseline. After 6 mo of PG and GB administration, serum nitrotyrosine levels before and after MTT were significantly decreased compared to baseline in both groups, while the decrease in nitrotyrosine levels before and after MTT was more marked in the subjects given PG. Our study results suggest that PG suppresses increases in postprandial glucose and TG levels, and improves insulin resistance; and, in addition, that PG may have a favorable impact on oxidative stress in type 2 diabetic patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21398600>Cholesterol diet leads to attenuation of ischemic preconditioning-induced cardiac protection: the role of connexin 43.</a></h1><p>Cardioprotection by ischemic preconditioning (IP) was abolished in connexin 43 (Cx43)-deficient mice due to loss of Cx43 located in mitochondria rather than at the sarcolemma.

After a 10-min perfusion, myocardial tissue cholesterol, superoxide, and nitrotyrosine contents were measured and Cx43 content in whole heart homogenate and a mitochondrial fraction determined. In the cholesterol-fed group, tissue cholesterol and superoxide formation was increased (P < 0.05), while total Cx43 content remained unchanged. Mitochondrial total and dephosphorylated Cx43 content decreased. Hearts were subjected to an IP protocol (3 × 5 min ischemia-reperfusion) or time-matched aerobic perfusion followed by 30-min global ischemia and 5-min reperfusion. IP reduced infarct size in normal but not in cholesterol-fed rats. At 5-min reperfusion following 30-min global ischemia, the total and dephosphorylated mitochondrial Cx43 content was increased, which was abolished by IP in both normal and high-cholesterol diet. In conclusion, loss of cardioprotection by IP in  is associated with a redistribution of both sarcolemmal and mitochondrial Cx43.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19478426>Oxidative stress related changes in the brain of hypercholesterolemic rabbits.</a></h1><p>In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that cholesterol plays a role in the pathology of Alzheimer disease. Since hypercholesterolemia was reported to increase the levels of reactive oxygen species and Alzheimer disease has clearly involved an oxidative component, it is possible that hypercholesterolemia is via increased oxidant production facilitating the disease development of the neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, we tested in an established model of enhanced cholesterol feed in rabbits the effects of serum cholesterol increase on oxidative stress parameters as well in serum as in the brain. In addition to that we tested the effects of vitamin E on the cholesterol-induced oxidative stress. Since Alzheimer disease is largely connected with increased protein oxidation whereas cholesterol is rather connected with lipid peroxidation processes, we tested both protein carbonyl levels and the formation of malondialdehyde, a marker of lipid peroxidation. We could clearly demonstrate an increase in serum malondialdehyde due to high cholesterol feeding, which is accompanied by an increase in protein oxidation parameters in the brain, especially in the hippocampus. Therefore, we suggest that specific neuropathological changes occur during the feeding of hypercholesterolemic diet.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24154684>Endocrine side effects of anti-cancer drugs: effects of anti-cancer targeted therapies on lipid and glucose metabolism.</a></h1><p>During the past years, targeted therapies for cancer have been developed using drugs that have significant metabolic consequences. Among them, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors and, to a much lesser extent, the  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are involved. mTOR plays a key role in the regulation of cell growth as well as lipid and glucose metabolism. Treatment with mTOR inhibitors is associated with a significant increase in plasma triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. mTOR inhibitors seem to increase plasma triglycerides by reducing the activity of the lipoprotein lipase which is in charge of the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. The increase in LDL cholesterol observed with mTOR inhibitors seems to be due to a decrease in LDL catabolism secondary to a reduction of LDL receptor expression. In addition, treatment with mTOR inhibitors is associated with a high incidence of hyperglycemia, ranging from 13 to 50% in the clinical trials. The mechanisms responsible for hyperglycemia with new onset diabetes are not clear, but are likely due to the combination of impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance. TKIs do not induce  but alter glucose homeostasis. Treatment with TKIs may be associated either with hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. The molecular mechanism by which TKIs control glucose homeostasis remains unknown. Owing to the metabolic consequences of these agents used as targeted anti-cancer therapies, a specific and personalized follow-up of blood glucose and lipids is recommended when using mTOR inhibitors and of blood glucose when using TKIs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29271534>Vascular risk factors and depression in Parkinson's disease.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to address the vascular depression hypothesis in Parkinson's disease (PD) from a large cohort of Chinese population.A cross-sectional analysis of 1784 Chinese patients with PD was conducted. Patients were divided into absence of depression (score ≤ 20) and presence of depression (score > 20) based on assessment of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Other clinical assessments included the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the frontal assessment battery (FAB) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).Patients with depression showed a higher proportion of women, longer disease duration, higher UPDRS part III score, higher levodopa equivalent daily dose use, higher occurrences of motor fluctuation and dyskinesia, lower FAB score and lower MoCA score than those without depression (P < 0.05). The proportions of drinking and overweight/obesity in the depression group were significantly lower than those in the non-depression group (P < 0.05). A forward binary logistic regression model indicated that depression in PD was associated with female sex [odds ratio (OR) 1.376, P = 0.025], higher UPDRS part III score (OR 1.042, P < 0.001), lower FAB score (OR 0.937, P = 0.015), anxiety (OR 18.156, P < 0.001) and overweight/obesity (OR 0.700, P = 0.019), whereas no associations were found with hypertension, diabetes, smoking, drinking,  and heart disease.Our study failed to verify the vascular depression hypothesis in PD. On the contrary, it was demonstrated that overweight/obesity is negatively associated with the presence of depression in PD.© 2017 EAN.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23872139>Fenofibrate suppresses melanogenesis in B16-F10 melanoma cells via activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.</a></h1><p>Fenofibrate and ciglitazone belong to the classes of fibrates and thiazolidinediones, respectively. Their pharmacological actions on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) present a potential therapy for  and hyperglycemia. However, the melanogenesis affected by PPAR ligands in melanocytes has not been well investigated. By determining the melanin content of cells treated with PPAR agonists, we showed that fenofibrate significantly reduced melanin synthesis, but its major active metabolite, fenofibric acid, did not. Notably, the suppression of melanogenesis by fenofibrate could not be prevented by the PPARα specific antagonist GW6471. In addition, T0901317, a liver X receptor (LXR) agonist, restored the antimelanogenic activity of fenofibrate. Accordingly, fenofibrate may suppress melanogenesis through a PPARα-independent pathway. Treatment of cells with fenofibrate led to the down-regulated gene expression of melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). Fenofibrate also attenuated the dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)-staining activity and expression of tyrosinase as well as the expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). The phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was stimulated by fenofibrate. Furthermore, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 prevented the repressive effects of fenofibrate on the melanin production. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that fenofibrate inhibits melanin synthesis via the down-regulation of MC1R, the up-regulation of p38 MAPK, and interference with LXR signaling pathways to decrease the expression of tyrosinase in B16-F10 melanoma cells.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Several key molecular players implicated in this process are expressed on monocytes and require protein- sulfation for optimal function in vitro, including human CCR2, CCR5, CX3CR1, and PSGL-1. We therefore hypothesized that protein- sulfation in hematopoietic cells plays an important role in the development of atherosclerosis.Lethally-irradiated Ldlr(-/-) mice were rescued with hematopoietic progenitors lacking tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST) activity attributable to deletion of the Tpst1 and Tpst2 genes. TPST deficient progenitors efficiently reconstituted hematopoiesis in Ldlr(-/-) recipients and transplantation had no effect on plasma lipids on a standard or atherogenic diet. However, we observed a substantial reduction in the size of atherosclerotic lesions and the number of macrophages in lesions from hyperlipidemic Ldlr(-/-) recipients transplanted with TPST deficient progenitors compared to wild-type progenitors. We also document for the first time that murine Psgl-1 and Cx3cr1 are -sulfated.These data demonstrate that protein- sulfation is an important contributor to monocytes/macrophage recruitment and/or retention in a mouse model of atherosclerosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31243247>[A case of recurrent cerebral infarction during treatment with oral  kinase inhibitors for chronic myelogenous leukemia].</a></h1><p>A 76-year-old man, diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia in 2010, had been on nilotinib for 7 years. He presented with right hemiparesis in September 2017. He had no history of hypertension, diabetes, , heart disease, or smoking. Brain MRI revealed a border-zone infarction of the left cerebral hemisphere and a rapidly progressing severe left internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. He was initiated on clopidogrel and bosutinib instead of nilotinib. He presented with right hemiparesis once again in December 2017. Brain MRI revealed the border-zone infarction of the left cerebral hemisphere and a more progressed, severe bilateral ICA stenosis. A carotid ultrasound demonstrated iso-intense and concentrically narrowed ICA on both sides. Carotid artery stenting of the left ICA was performed in February 2018, and clopidogrel was replaced by cilostazol to provide a drug-induced rush. Carotid artery stenting of the right ICA was performed in June 2018 and cervical angiogram demonstrated that there were no residual artery stenoses in the bilateral stent. In recent years, several case reports suggest that  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are associated with progressive artery stenosis and cause cerebral infarction. Brain imaging tests should be conducted to evaluate arterial stenosis progression for patients with a history of taking TKI when an arterial vascular event occurs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22244558>Effects of alcohol on pericardial adhesion formation in hypercholesterolemic swine.</a></h1><p>Reoperative cardiac surgery is complicated in part because of extensive adhesions encountered during the second operation. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of alcohol with and without resveratrol (red wine vs vodka) on postoperative pericardial adhesion formation in a porcine model of hypercholesterolemia and chronic myocardial ischemia.Male Yorkshire swine were fed a high-cholesterol diet to simulate conditions of coronary artery disease followed by surgical placement of an ameroid constrictor to induce chronic ischemia. Postoperatively, control pigs continued their high-cholesterol diet alone, whereas the 2 experimental groups had diets supplemented with red wine or vodka. Seven weeks after ameroid placement, all animals underwent reoperative sternotomy.Compared with controls, pericardial adhesion grade was markedly reduced in the vodka group, whereas there was no difference in the wine group. Intramyocardial fibrosis was significantly reduced in the vodka group compared with controls. There was no difference in expression of proteins involved in focal adhesion formation between any groups (focal adhesion kinase, integrin alpha-5, integrin beta-1, paxillin, vinculin, protein  kinase 2, protein kinase C ε, and phosphorylated protein kinase C ε). The wine group exhibited elevated C-reactive protein levels versus the control and vodka groups.Postoperative vodka consumption markedly reduced the formation of pericardial adhesions and intramyocardial fibrosis, whereas red wine had no effect. Analysis of protein expression did not reveal any obvious explanation for this phenomenon, suggesting a post-translational effect of alcohol on fibrous tissue deposition. The difference in adhesion formation in the vodka versus wine groups may be due to increased inflammation in the wine group.Copyright Â© 2012 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

Nitric oxide may, however, not only be scavenged by reaction with endothelium-derived superoxide but also form the potent oxidant and inhibitor of vascular function, peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)).Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits were treated for three days with NTG patches. Normolipidemic New Zealand White rabbits (NZWR) served as controls. Endothelial function was assessed ex vivo with organ chamber experiments and vascular superoxide was quantified using lucigenin (5 and 250 microM) and CLA-enhanced chemiluminescence. Vascular ONOO(-) formation was determined using nitrotyrosine antibodies. The activity of the cGMP-dependent kinase (cGK-I) was assessed by determining the phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein VASP (P-VASP).Nitroglycerin treatment caused endothelial dysfunction in NZWR and WHHL, associated with an increase in superoxide and ONOO(-) production and a substantial drop in cGK-I activity. In vivo NTG-treatment decreased lipophilic antioxidants (alpha- and beta-carotene) in NZWR and WHHL. Treatment of NZWR with NTG also decreased plasma extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD)-activity.Nitroglycerin treatment of WHHL with exogenous NO worsens rather than improves endothelial dysfunction secondary to increased formation of superoxide and/or peroxynitrite leading to decreased cGK-I activity. The decrease in plasma levels of alpha- and beta-carotene may be at least in part due to a decrease in EC-SOD activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12663685>Increased endothelin-induced Ca2+ signaling,  phosphorylation, and coronary artery disease in diabetic dyslipidemic Swine are prevented by atorvastatin.</a></h1><p>Endothelin-1 (ET-1) signaling mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of excess coronary artery disease in diabetic dyslipidemia. We hypothesized that in diabetic dyslipidemia ET-1-induced coronary smooth muscle calcium (Ca2+m) and  phosphorylation would be increased, and the lipid lowering agent, atorvastatin, would inhibit these increases. Male Yucatan miniature swine groups were treated for 20 weeks: normal low-fat fed control, high-fat/cholesterol fed (hyperlipidemic), hyperlipidemic made diabetic with alloxan (diabetic dyslipidemic), and diabetic dyslipidemic treated with atorvastatin (atorvastatin-treated). Blood glucose values were 5-fold greater in diabetic dyslipidemic and atorvastatin-treated versus control and hyperlipidemic. Total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) plasma cholesterol in hyperlipidemic, diabetic dyslipidemic, and atorvastatin-treated were approximately 5-fold greater than control. Intravascular ultrasound detectable coronary disease and hypertriglyceridemia were only observed in diabetic dyslipidemic and were abolished by atorvastatin. In freshly isolated cells, the Ca2+m response to ET-1 in diabetic dyslipidemic was greater than in control, hyperlipidemic, and atorvastatin-treated groups. Selective ET-1 receptor antagonists showed in the control group that the ETB subtype inhibits ETA regulation of Ca2+m. There was almost a complete switch of receptor subtype regulation of Ca2+m from largely ETA in control to an increased inhibitory interaction between ETA and ETB in hyperlipidemic and diabetic dyslipidemic groups, such that neither ETA nor ETB antagonist alone could block the ET-1-induced Ca2+m response. The inhibitory interaction was attenuated in the atorvastatin-treated group. In single cells, basal and ET-1-induced  phosphorylation in diabetic dyslipidemic were more than 3- and 6-fold greater, respectively, than in control, hyperlipidemic, and atorvastatin-treated. Attenuation by atorvastatin of coronary disease and ET-1-induced Ca2+m and  phosphorylation signaling with no change in cholesterol provides strong evidence for direct actions of atorvastatin and/or triglycerides on the vascular wall.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19605464>Membrane localization of protein- phosphatase 1B is essential for its activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 gene expression and consequent hypertriglyceridaemia.</a></h1><p>Protein- phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a major regulator of insulin sensitivity. We have described a novel action of PTP1B in the induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) gene expression through activation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). PTP1B is anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane via its C-terminal tail. We have previously reported that membrane localization of PTP1B is essential for PP2A activation, which is crucial for enhancing SREBP-1 gene expression in in vitro experiments. In this study, we further investigated the physiological importance of membrane localization of PTP1B in vivo. We found that transient liver-specific overexpression of wild-type PTP1B (PTP1B-WT) using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was associated with hypertriglyceridaemia and enhanced hepatic SREBP-1 gene expression in mice. However, overexpression of the C-terminal truncated PTP1B (PTP1BDeltaCT) failed to increase hepatic SREBP-1 expression or serum triglyceride levels, despite causing insulin resistance. Our results indicate that activation of PTP1B in the liver could induce hypertriglyceridaemia and that anchoring of PTP1B to the membrane is crucial for its action.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16098827>Identification of SH2-B as a key regulator of leptin sensitivity, energy balance, and body weight in mice.</a></h1><p>Leptin regulates energy balance and body weight by activating its receptor LEPRb and multiple downstream signaling pathways, including the STAT3 and the IRS2/PI 3-kinase pathways, in the hypothalamus. Leptin stimulates activation of LEPRb-associated JAK2, which initiates cell signaling. Here we identified SH2-B, a JAK2-interacting protein, as a key regulator of leptin sensitivity, energy balance, and body weight. SH2-B homozygous null mice were severely hyperphagic and obese and developed a metabolic syndrome characterized by hyperleptinemia, hyperinsulinemia, , hepatic steatosis, and hyperglycemia. The expression of hypothalamic orexigenic NPY and AgRP was increased in SH2-B(-/-) mice. Leptin-stimulated activation of hypothalamic JAK2 and phosphorylation of hypothalamic STAT3 and IRS2 were significantly impaired in SH2-B(-/-) mice. Moreover, overexpression of SH2-B counteracted PTP1B-mediated inhibition of leptin signaling in cultured cells. Our data suggest that SH2-B is an endogenous enhancer of leptin sensitivity and required for maintaining normal energy metabolism and body weight in mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21457788>Tyrphostin AG490 reduces NAPDH oxidase activity and expression in the aorta of hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice.</a></h1><p>Oxidative stress-induced vascular injury represents a major contributor to the pathoetiology of atherosclerosis. Elevated NADPH oxidase (Nox) activity promotes oxidative injury of the cardiovascular cells. Janus--kinase (Jak) family regulate various aspects of the atherosclerotic process e.g., inflammation, cellular growth, proliferation, and migration. Here, we investigated the potential of Jak2 inhibition to counteract Nox-dependent O(2)(•-) formation in atherogenesis in hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice. Male ApoE(-/-) mice fed a high-fat, cholesterol-rich diet were treated for 5 weeks with either vehicle or tyrphostin AG490 (1 mg/kg), a specific Jak2 inhibitor. Lucigenin-enhanced-chemiluminescence assay, real-time PCR and Western blot analysis revealed that Nox-derived O(2)(•-) generation, Nox1, Nox2, and Nox4 mRNA and protein levels were significantly elevated in the aortas of ApoE(-/-) mice fed a high-fat diet compared to ApoE(-/-) mice fed a normal diet. Treatment with tyrphostin AG490 significantly reduced the up-regulated Nox activity, the expression of each Nox subtype, as well as the protein level of CD68, a macrophage-specific marker. Morphometric analysis showed a marked reduction of atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta of AG490-treated animals. These data provide new insights into the regulation of vascular Nox by tyrphostins in the cardiovascular system. Since Jak2 transduces the signals of various cardiovascular risk factors, pharmacological manipulation of this signaling pathway may represent a novel strategy to reduce oxidative stress in atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Thirty-two patients received daily erlotinib and sirolimus. The doses of erlotinib and sirolimus were 150 mg and 5 mg for patients not on concurrent CYP3A-inducing anti-epileptics (EIAEDS), and 450 mg and 10 mg for patients on EIAEDS. Evaluations were performed every two months. The primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival and secondary endpoints included safety and overall survival. Archival tumor samples were assessed for EGFR, EGFRvIII, PTEN, pAKT and pS6. Enrolled patients were heavily pre-treated including 53% who had received three or more prior chemotherapy agents and 28% who had received prior bevacizumab therapy. The most common grade > or = 2 adverse events were rash (59%), mucositis (34%) and diarrhea (31%). Grade 3 or higher events were rare. Best radiographic response included stable disease in 15 patients (47%); no patients achieved either a CR or PR. The estimated 6-month progression-free survival was 3.1% for all patients. Progression-free survival was better for patients not on EIAEDs (P = 0.03). Tumor markers failed to show an association with PFS except for increased pAKT expression which achieved borderline significance (P = 0.045). Although neither rash nor diarrhea had an association with outcome,  was associated with longer PFS (P = 0.029).

The aim of this study was to analyze semen and sperm function in diet-induced hypercholesterolemic rabbits. Twelve adult White New Zealand male rabbits were fed ad libitum a control diet or a diet supplemented with 0.05% cholesterol. Rabbits under cholesterol-enriched diet significantly increased total cholesterol level in the serum. Semen examination revealed a significant reduction in semen volume and sperm motility in hypercholesterolemic rabbits (HCR). Sperm cell morphology was seriously affected, displaying primarily a "folded head"-head fold along the major axe-, and the presence of cytoplasmic droplet on sperm flagellum. Cholesterol was particularly increased in acrosomal region when detected by filipin probe. The rise in cholesterol concentration in sperm cells was determined quantitatively by Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analyses. We also found a reduction of protein  phosphorylation in sperm incubated under capacitating conditions from HCR. Interestingly, the addition of Protein Kinase A pathway activators -dibutyryl-cyclic AMP and iso-butylmethylxanthine- to the medium restored sperm capacitation. Finally, it was also reported a significant decrease in the percentage of reacted sperm in the presence of progesterone. In conclusion, our data showed that diet-induced hypercholesterolemia adversely affects semen quality and sperm motility, capacitation and acrosomal reaction in rabbits; probably due to an increase in cellular cholesterol content that alters membrane related events.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18497479>Effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor antagonist combination on nitric oxide bioavailability and atherosclerotic change in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits.</a></h1><p>We investigated the effects of co-administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) on nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability in genetically hyperlipidemic rabbits with our newly developed NO sensor. Plasma NO was measured using the new NO sensor in the abdominal aorta of anesthetized Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits. Acetylcholine (ACh)-stimulated (20 microg in 5 min into the aortic arch) NO production was recorded after an 8 week per os pretreatment with 1) vehicle (control), 2) the ACEI enalapril (E: 3 mg/kg/day), 3) the ARB losartan (L: 30 mg/kg/day) and 4) enalapril (1.5 mg/kg/day)+losartan (15 mg/kg/day) (E+L). Intra-aortic infusion of ACh produced an increase in plasma NO concentration, which was significantly greater with all the drug treatments than with the control. E increased ACh-induced NO significantly more than L (by 6.9 nmol/L, and 4.7 nmol/L, respectively). E+L increased ACh-induced NO by 9.5 nmol/L, significantly more than either E or L. Plasma peroxynitrite concentration was 1.2 pmol/mg protein in the control group and significantly less than in the E- and L-group. The lowest peroxynitrite concentration was observed in the E+L group (0.5 pmol/mg protein), which was significantly lower than in the E-group and the L-group. Optical coherence tomography and histology of the thoracic aorta revealed that the plaque area decreased significantly more with the combination than with the monotherapy (p<0.01).

HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors are commonly used in HC, but their effects on renal haemodynamics and function in HC are poorly understood.Pigs were studied after a 12-week normal diet, a 2% high-cholesterol diet (HC) or an HC diet supplemented with simvastatin (HC+simvastatin, 80 mg/day) (n=6-8 each group). Renal haemodynamics and function were quantified in vivo with electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT). Shock-frozen renal tissue was subsequently studied using immunohistochemistry.LDL cholesterol was similarly increased in HC and HC+simvastatin. Simvastatin-treated animals showed increased expression of endothelial nitric-oxide-synthase (eNOS), and decreased expression of the ox-LDL receptor LOX-1 in renal endothelial cells. Simvastatin also decreased tubular immunoreactivity of inducible-NOS, nitrotyrosine, nuclear-factor-kappaB, and tubuloglomerular trichrome staining. These were associated with a significant increase in cortical (6.1+/-0.1 vs 5.0+/-0.3 and 5.0+/-0.1 ml/min/cc, respectively, P<0.001) and medullary perfusion in HC+simvastatin compared to normal and HC.Simvastatin attenuated the inflammatory and pro-oxidative environment as well as fibrosis in kidneys in pigs with diet-induced HC, in association with enhanced renal perfusion.

Apheresis was efficient in reduction of atherogenic lipoproteins, complement, fibrinogen, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and oxidative parameters including phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide (PCOOH), malonaldehyde, methylguanidine, and diotyrosine. Apheresis itself, however, activated leukocytes to increase ROS activity and reduced the plasma ROS scavenging activity. Ascorbate administration selectively diminished apheresis-enhanced H2O2 and inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Chronically dyslipidemic and uremic patients undergoing biweekly apheresis plus ascorbate treatment had lower levels of C-reactive protein and PCOOH than did those without ascorbate treatment during a 6-month follow-up study period.We demonstrate that apheresis with ascorbate treatment provides a therapeutic potential in reducing atherosclerotic risk via inhibition of H2O2-induced oxidative stress in patients with uremia or dyslipidemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23722270>MicroRNA-25-dependent up-regulation of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) mediates hypercholesterolemia-induced oxidative/nitrative stress and subsequent dysfunction in the heart.</a></h1><p>Diet-induced hypercholesterolemia leads to oxidative/nitrative stress and subsequent myocardial dysfunction. However, the regulatory role of microRNAs in this phenomenon is unknown. We aimed to investigate, whether hypercholesterolemia-induced myocardial microRNA alterations play a role in the development of oxidative/nitrative stress and in subsequent cardiac dysfunction. Male Wistar rats were fed with 2% cholesterol/0.25% cholate-enriched or standard diet for 12weeks. Serum and tissue cholesterol levels were significantly elevated by cholesterol-enriched diet. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was significantly increased in cholesterol-fed rats both in vivo and in isolated perfused hearts, indicating diastolic dysfunction. Myocardial expression of microRNAs was affected by cholesterol-enriched diet as assessed by microarray analysis. MicroRNA-25 showed a significant down-regulation as detected by microarray analysis and QRT-PCR. In silico target prediction revealed NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) as a putative target of microRNA-25. NOX4 protein showed significant up-regulation in the hearts of cholesterol-fed rats, while NOX1 and NOX2 remained unaffected. Cholesterol-feeding significantly increased myocardial oxidative/nitrative stress as assessed by dihydroethidium staining, protein oxidation assay, and nitro- ELISA, respectively. Direct binding of microRNA-25 mimic to the 3' UTR region of NOX4 was demonstrated using a luciferase reporter assay. Transfection of a microRNA-25 mimic into primary cardiomyocytes decreased superoxide production, while a microRNA-25 inhibitor resulted in an up-regulation of NOX4 protein and an increase in oxidative stress that was attenuated by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium. Here we demonstrated for the first time that hypercholesterolemia affects myocardial microRNA expression, and by down-regulating microRNA-25 increases NOX4 expression and consequently oxidative/nitrative stress in the heart. We conclude that hypercholesterolemia-induced microRNA alterations play an important role in the regulation of oxidative/nitrative stress and in consequent myocardial dysfunction.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Wistar rats fed HFr for 12 wk were treated orally with C. oil (300 mg/kg) in the last two weeks. To examine the protective effect of C. oil, blood glucose, serum insulin, platelet aggregation, thrombosis and inflammatory markers were assessed in these animals.Animals fed with HFr diet for 12 wk demonstrated , hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia, alteration in insulin sensitivity indices, increased lipid peroxidation, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, platelet free radical generation,  phosphorylation, aggregation, adhesion and intravascular thrombosis. Curcuma oil treatment for the last four weeks in hamsters ameliorated HFr-induced , hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, platelet activation, and thrombosis. In HFr fed hamsters, the effect of C. oil at 300 mg/kg [ ] was comparable with the standard drug fenofibrate. Curcuma oil treatment in the last two weeks in rats ameliorated HFr-induced hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia by modulating hepatic expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator 1 (PGC-1)α and PGC-1β genes known to be involved in lipid and glucose metabolism.High fructose feeding to rats and hamsters led to the development of insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia, endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress. C. oil prevented development of thrombotic complications associated with insulin resistance perhaps by modulating genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. Further studies are required to confirm these findings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31262499>GC-MS based metabolomics strategy to distinguish three types of acute pancreatitis.</a></h1><p>Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a progressive systemic inflammatory response with high morbidity and high mortality, which is mainly caused by alcohol, bulimia, gallstones and . The early diagnosis of different types of AP and further explore potential pathophysiological mechanism of each type of AP is beneficial for optimized treatment strategies and better patient's care. In this study, a metabolomics approach based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and random forests algorithm was established to distinguish biliary acute pancreatitis (BAP),  acute pancreatitis (HLAP), and alcoholic acute pancreatitis (AAP), from healthy controls. The classification accuracies for BAP, HLAP, and AAP patients compared with healthy control, were 0.886, 0.906 and 0.857, respectively, by using 5-fold cross-validation method. And some special metabolites for each type of AP were discovered, such as l-Lactic acid, (R)-3-Hydroxybutyric acid, Phosphoric acid, Glycine, Erythronic acid, l-Phenylalanine, d-Galactose, , Arachidonic acid, Glycerol 1-hexadecanoate. Furthermore, associations between these metabolites with the metabolism of amino acids, fatty acids were identified. Our studies have illuminated the biomarkers and physiological mechanism of disease in a clinical setting, which suggested that metabolomics is a valuable tool for identifying the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the etiology of BAP, AAP, HLAP and thus novel therapeutic targets.Copyright © 2019.

However, knowledge of these relationships is lacking in children, despite the growing public health problem posed by childhood obesity. The aim of this study was to assess whether plasma-free amino acid profiles can serve as useful biomarkers of lifestyle-related diseases in children with obesity.This retrospective study used the medical records of 26 patients (15 male, 11 female) aged 9 or 10 years presenting with moderate to severe obesity and  between April 2015 and March 2017. A degree of obesity of 30% or more was defined as moderate or severe. Amino acid levels were compared between obese children with and without impaired glucose tolerance using a t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. In addition, the influence of factors such as intima media thickness, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, amino acids, and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were analyzed pairwise using Pearson's correlation or Spearman's rank correlation.HOMA-IR was positively correlated with valine, leucine (Leu), isoleucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, threonine, lysine, alanine, , glutamate (Glu), proline, arginine, ornithine, total free amino acids (all P < 0.01), and aspartate (P = 0.010). Moreover, blood uric acid levels were positively correlated with Leu (P = 0.005) and Glu (P = 0.019), and negatively correlated with serine, glycine, and asparagine (P = 0.007, P = 0.003, and P = 0.013, respectively).Amino acid profile reflects impaired glucose tolerance and hyperuricemia at an early stage of obesity. It is therefore a useful marker to inform early intervention in children with obesity, as in adults.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18282574>Lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) acts as a receptor for remnant-like lipoprotein particles (RLPs) and mediates RLP-induced migration of vascular smooth muscle cells.</a></h1><p>Remnant-like lipoprotein particles (RLPs) have been implicated in atherogenesis especially by diabetic dyslipidemia; however, their receptor(s) and effects on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) remain unclear. In this study, we examined if lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) acts as a receptor for RLPs and its biological effects in VSMCs.RLPs were isolated from human plasma by immunoaffinity gel containing anti-apolipoprotein A-I and anti-apolipoprotein B-100 monoclonal antibodies. DiI-labeled RLPs were taken up by CHO-K1 cells stably expressing LOX-1 but not by wild-type CHO-K1 cells. RLPs induced LOX-1 expression and cell migration in bovine VSMCs (BVSMCs), which were significantly suppressed by transfection with LOX-1 specific siRNAs. Inhibitors of metalloproteinases, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor  kinase, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), MAPK kinase (MEK1) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) significantly blocked RLP-induced LOX-1 expression and cell migration of BVSMCs.The present study provides direct evidence that LOX-1 is a novel receptor for RLPs in VSMCs. LOX-1-mediated uptake of RLPs may thus play important roles in atherogenesis by inducing LOX-1 expression and VSMC migration especially in the settings of postprandial , diabetes and metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26997520>A study on the association between  and hypothyroidism and the response to TKIs in metastatic renal cell carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Vascular endothelial growth facto receptor- kinase inhibitors (VEGFR-TKIs) are widely used for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).

All patients received first-line TKI therapy. Survival analysis was performed with a significance level of 0.05 using a Kaplan-Meier curve. The χ(2) test was used for the intergroup comparison. The Cox regression model was used for the analysis of multiple factors affecting survival.The median survival for the whole group (n = 155) was 36.2 months. A total of 57 patients (36.8 percent) developed hypothyroidism and 85 patients (54.9 percent) experienced . The response rate (RR) and median progression-free survival (mPFS) for patients with normal thyroid function were 32.7 percent and 9.1 months, respectively, 54.5 percent and 13.7 months with grade I hypothyroidism, 70.8 percent and 23.8 months with grade II hypothyroidism (P values of 0.001 and 0.017, respectively). The RR and mPFS for patients with normal blood lipids were 23.9 percent and 8.0 months, respectively, 54.0 percent and 12.9 months with grade I , 60.7 percent and 14.0 months with grade II , and 100.0 percent and 22.2 months with grade III . Significant differences in the RR and mPFS were seen between groups (the P values were 0.000 and 0.005, respectively).Hypothyroidism or  may be effective predictive factors for response to treatment with VEGFR-TKIs in mRCC patients.

Obese Zucker rats exhibit hyperphagia, obesity, insulin resistance, , and glomerulosclerosis and are frequently used as a model to study hereditary form of metabolic syndrome. Nitric oxide plays a major role in preservation of renal function and structure. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that renal disease in this model may be associated with down-regulation of endothelial (eNOS) and neuromal NO synthases (nNOS) in the kidney. The study further sought to explore expressions of caveolin-1, phospho AKt, and calmodulin, which regulate activities of constituitive NOS isoforms, as well as soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which is involved in NO signaling.Twenty-two-week-old male obese and lean Zucker rats were studied. Body weight, serum lipids, urine albumin excretion, and renal tissue abundance of the above proteins were determined.Serum glucose and arterial pressure were unchanged, whereas urinary NO metabolite (NO(chi)) excretion and renal tissue nitrotyrosine abundance were markedly reduced (denoting depressed NO production) in the obese versus lean Zucker rats. This was accompanied by significant glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial damage, renal immune cell infiltration, marked down-regulations of renal tissue eNOS and nNOS, mild reduction of caveolin-1, and unchanged calmodulin, phospho-AKt, and sGC.Hereditary obesity can result in down-regulations of kidney eNOS and nNOS, marked reduction of NO production, and glomerulosclerosis prior to the onset of frank diabetes and hypertension.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18469500>Effects of atorvastatin and pravastatin on signal transduction related to glucose uptake in 3T3L1 adipocytes.</a></h1><p>A number of patients with  are prescribed 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors that are concomitantly used along with the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The effects of atorvastatin and pravastatin on insulin-induced glucose uptake and the related signal transduction in 3T3L1 adipocytes were studied. 3T3L1 fibroblasts were differentiated into adipocytes, pretreated with atorvastatin or pravastatin, and then exposed to insulin. Glucose uptake and the amount of insulin signal proteins were measured. Atorvastatin significantly decreased insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake in 3T3L1 adipocytes associated with the prevention of translocation of GLUT4 into the plasma membrane. The amounts of Rab4 and RhoA that required lipid modification with farnesyl or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, in the membrane fraction were decreased by atorvastatin. Insulin-induced  phosphorylation of IRS-1 and serine/threonine phosphorylation of Akt were reduced by atorvastatin. Pravastatin did not modify these insulin-induced changes in the signal transduction. Inhibitors of the RhoA/Rho kinase system, C3 and Y27632, as well as atorvastatin reduced insulin-induced changes in signal transduction. Atorvastatin and pravastatin did not affect messenger RNA expression, protein level, and  phosphorylation of insulin receptors. In conclusion, hydrophobic atorvastatin decreases the glucose uptake by 3T3L1 adipocytes since it can enter the cell and prevents lipid modification of some proteins that are involved in the insulin signal transduction process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25486251>Amelioration of hypercholesterolemia by an EGFR  kinase inhibitor in mice with liver-specific knockout of Mig-6.</a></h1><p>Mitogen-inducible gene 6 (Mig-6) is a negative feedback inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. We previously found that Mig-6 plays a critical role in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis and in bile acid synthesis. In this study, we investigated the effects of EGFR inhibition to identify a potential new treatment target for hypercholesterolemia. We used a mouse model with conditional ablation of the Mig-6 gene in the liver (Albcre/+Mig-6f/f; Mig-6d/d) to effectively investigate the role of Mig-6 in the regulation of liver function. Mig-6d/d mice were treated with either the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib or statin for 6 weeks after administration of a high-fat or standard diet. We then compared lipid profiles and other parameters among each group of mice. After a high-fat diet, Mig-6d/d mice showed elevated serum levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose, characteristics resembling hypercholesterolemia in diabetic patients. We observed decreases in serum levels of lipids and glucose in high-fat-diet-fed Mig-6d/d mice after 6 weeks of treatment with gefitinib or statin. Furthermore gefitinib-treated mice showed significantly greater decreases in serum levels of total, HDL and LDL cholesterol compared with statin-treated mice. Taken together, these results suggest that EGFR inhibition is effective for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in high-fat-diet-fed Mig-6d/d mice, and our findings provide new insights into the development of possible treatment targets for hypercholesterolemia via modulation of EGFR inhibition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24843732>Palmitate induces reactive oxygen species production and β-cell dysfunction by activating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase through Src signaling.</a></h1><p>Chronic  impairs pancreatic β-cell function, referred to as lipotoxicity. We have reported an important role of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction by activation of Src, a non-receptor  kinase, in impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion (GIIS) from diabetic rat islets. In the present study, we investigated the role of ROS production by Src signaling in palmitate-induced dysfunction of β-cells.After rat insulinoma INS-1D cells were exposed to 0.6 mmol/L palmitate for 24 h (palmitate exposure); GIIS, ROS production and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX) activity were examined with or without exposure to10 μmol/L 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2), a Src inhibitior, for 30 or 60 min.Exposure to PP2 recovered impaired GIIS and decreased ROS overproduction as a result of palmitate exposure. Palmitate exposure increased activity of NOX and protein levels of NOX2, a pathological ROS source in β-cells. Palmitate exposure increased the protein level of p47 (phox) , a regulatory protein of NOX2, in membrane fraction compared with control, which was reduced by PP2. Transfection of small interfering ribonucleic acid of p47 (phox) suppressed the augmented p47 (phox) protein level in membrane fraction, decreased augmented ROS production and increased impaired GΙIS by palmitate exposure. In addition, exposure to PP2 ameliorated impaired GIIS and decreased ROS production in isolated islets of KK-A(y) mice, an obese diabetic model with .Activation of NOX through Src signaling plays an important role in ROS overproduction and impaired GΙIS caused by chronic exposure to palmitate, suggesting a lipotoxic mechanism of β-cell dysfunction of obese mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11697231>PPAR gamma/RXR as a molecular target for diabetes.</a></h1><p>Type 2 diabetes is associated with insulin resistance in peripheral tissues, such as muscle and fat. Novel therapies that improve insulin action include ligands that bind and activate the nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator activating receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) and retinoid X receptor (RXR). PPAR gamma/RXR form heterodimers that regulate transcription of genes involved in insulin action, adipocyte differentiation, lipid metabolism and inflammation. PPAR gamma activators include prostanoids, fatty acids, thiazolidinediones and N-(2-benzoylphenyl) analogues. RXR ligands include naturally occurring retinoic acid and synthetic rexinoids. Selective ligands for these receptors improve metabolic abnormalities associated with type 2 diabetes, such as hyperglycemia, , insulin resistance and other cardiovascular risk factors. Although adipose tissue mediates some of the effects of PPAR gamma/RXR ligands, other tissues also regulate the effects of these receptors. The activity of the PPAR gamma/RXR heterodimer is influenced by posttranslational modifications, receptor turnover, polymorphisms, splice variants, coactivators and corepressors. This article reviews recent developments in research on these receptors, with particular emphasis on metabolic effects, ligand selectivity, structure and regulation of the PPAR gamma/RXR heterodimer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24400094>Phosphoproteomic analysis of platelets activated by pro-thrombotic oxidized phospholipids and thrombin.</a></h1><p>Specific oxidized phospholipids (oxPCCD36) promote platelet hyper-reactivity and thrombosis in  via the scavenger receptor CD36, however the signaling pathway(s) induced in platelets by oxPCCD36 are not well defined. We have employed mass spectrometry-based , serine, and threonine phosphoproteomics for the unbiased analysis of platelet signaling pathways induced by oxPCCD36 as well as by the strong physiological agonist thrombin. oxPCCD36 and thrombin induced differential phosphorylation of 115 proteins (162 phosphorylation sites) and 181 proteins (334 phosphorylation sites) respectively. Most of the phosphoproteome changes induced by either agonist have never been reported in platelets; thus they provide candidates in the study of platelet signaling. Bioinformatic analyses of protein phosphorylation dependent responses were used to categorize preferential motifs for (de)phosphorylation, predict pathways and kinase activity, and construct a phosphoproteome network regulating integrin activation. A putative signaling pathway involving Src-family kinases, SYK, and PLCγ2 was identified in platelets activated by oxPCCD36. Subsequent ex vivo studies in human platelets demonstrated that this pathway is downstream of the scavenger receptor CD36 and is critical for platelet activation by oxPCCD36. Our results provide multiple insights into the mechanism of platelet activation and specifically in platelet regulation by oxPCCD36.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16950138>A CD36-dependent signaling cascade is necessary for macrophage foam cell formation.</a></h1><p>Accumulation of macrophage foam cells in atherosclerotic blood vessel intima is a critical component of atherogenesis mediated by scavenger receptor-dependent internalization of oxidized LDL. We demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down assays that the macrophage scavenger receptor CD36 associates with a signaling complex containing Lyn and MEKK2. The MAP kinases JNK1 and JNK2 were specifically phosphorylated in macrophages exposed to oxLDL. Using cells isolated from SRA, TLR2, or CD36 null mice, and phospholipid ligands specific for either SRA or CD36, we showed that JNK activation was mediated by CD36. Both foam cell formation and activation of JNK2 in hyperlipidemic mice were diminished in the absence of CD36. Furthermore, inhibition of Src or JNK blocked oxLDL uptake and inhibited foam cell formation in vitro and in vivo. These findings show that a specific CD36-dependent signaling pathway initiated by oxLDL is necessary for foam cell formation and identify potential targets for antiatherosclerosis therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20697842>Long-term response with everolimus for metastatic renal cell carcinoma refractory to sunitinib.</a></h1><p>A 70-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma developed progressive liver metastases after 8 weeks of treatment with the multitargeted  kinase inhibitor (TKI) sunitinib.

Each extract was examined for melanin synthesis inhibitory and anti-allergy activity on B16-melanoma and RBL-2H3 cells using IgE and A23187 as a stimulant for β-hexosaminidase release, respectively. We also evaluated the inhibition of two enzymes, lipase and acetylcholine esterase, and of the bacterial growth of two species, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureaus. The anti-oxidant activity was determined using oxygen radical anti-oxidant capacity, ORAC assay and its relation to the phenolic content was estimated using the Folin-Ciocalteu method. Besides, the protective effect of the extracts against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in mouse neuroblastoma, Neuro-2A cells was investigated.The most active extract exhibiting melanin synthesis inhibition (63%) and at the same time with low cytotoxicity (15%) was the ethanol extract of roots at 20 µg/ml, followed by the ethanol extract of stems (57% inhibition, 5% cytotoxicity). On the other hand, the highest inhibitions of β-hexosaminidase release were recorded for the ethanol extract of leaves with IC50 value of 6.89 µg/ml followed by the water extract of the seeds and leaves with IC50 value of 78.32 and 88.44 µg/ml, respectively. For anti-lipase assay, ethanol extracts of the stems and roots showed the strongest inhibition with IC50 values of 204.06 and 216.24 µg/ml, respectively. None of the examined extracts showed any activity against Escherichia coli. while the ethanol extract of the roots and stems showed moderate inhibition for Staphylococcus aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration of 400 µg/ml. Ethanol extract of the roots showed only 30% inhibition of acetylcholine esterase enzyme.

In this study, we examined whether isohumulones ameliorate renal injury. Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats were fed a low-salt diet (LS), a high-salt diet (HS) or a high-salt diet containing 0.3% isohumulones (HS+IH) for 4 weeks. Urinary nitrite/nitrate (NOx) excretion was measured at 4 weeks along with blood pressure and urinary protein excretion. Renal injury was evaluated histologically and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) production in the renal cortex was visualized. Oxidative stress and NO synthase (NOS) expression were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis. Mean blood pressure was significantly decreased in the HS+IH group compared with the HS group at 4 weeks (158.1+/-8.7 vs. 177.5+/-3.7 mmHg; p<0.05). Isohumulones prevented the development of proteinuria in the HS+IH group compared with the HS group at 2 weeks (61.7+/-26.8 vs. 117.2+/-9.8 mg/day; p<0.05). Glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis scores were significantly decreased in the HS+IH group compared with the HS group (0.61+/-0.11 vs. 1.55+/-0.23, 23.7+/-6.8 vs. 36.1+/-3.5%; p<0.05 for both). In the HS group, increased ROS and decreased NO were observed in glomeruli in vivo. Isohumulones reduced the ROS production, leading to the restoration of bioavailable NO. Urinary NOx excretion was significantly increased in the HS+IH group compared with the HS group. Furthermore, renal nitrotyrosine was increased in the HS group compared with the LS group, and this effect was prevented by isohumulones. Renal NOS expression did not differ among the three groups.

These changes were also associated with a reduction in motility percentage and appearance of abnormal sperm morphology. The present study was carried out to evaluate the effect of dietary olive oil (OO, 7% v/w) administration to several male hypercholesterolemic rabbits (hypercholesterolemic rabbits, HCR) with altered fertility parameters. These HCR males were achieved by feeding normal rabbits with a high-fat diet (0.05% chol). HCR were associated with a modest non-significant increase in body weight (standard diet, 4.08±0.17 Kg, versus high-fat diet, 4.37±0.24 Kg). Hypercholesterolemic rabbits presented a marked decrease in semen volume, sperm cell count, and percentage of sperm motility, associated with a significant increase in sperm cell abnormalities. Moreover, sperm capacitation measured by the characteristic phosphorylated protein pattern in and induced acrosomal reaction were also altered suggesting sperm dysfunction. However, the administration of OO (for 16 weeks) to rabbits that were fed with 50% of the high-fat diet normalized serum chol. Curiously, OO supply succeeded to attenuate the seminal and sperm alterations observed in HCR group. Administration of OO alone did not cause any significant changes in above mentioned parameters. These data suggest that OO administration to HCR male rabbits recovers the loss of semen quality and sperm functionality.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16371644>Imatinib and .</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19005075>Maternal high-fat diet and fetal programming: increased proliferation of hypothalamic peptide-producing neurons that increase risk for overeating and obesity.</a></h1><p>Recent studies in adult and weanling rats show that dietary fat, in close association with circulating lipids, can stimulate expression of hypothalamic peptides involved in controlling food intake and body weight. In the present study, we examined the possibility that a fat-rich diet during pregnancy alters the development of these peptide systems in utero, producing neuronal changes in the offspring that persist postnatally in the absence of the diet and have long-term consequences. The offspring of dams on a high-fat diet (HFD) versus balanced diet (BD), from embryonic day 6 to postnatal day 15 (P15), showed increased expression of orexigenic peptides, galanin, enkephalin, and dynorphin, in the paraventricular nucleus and orexin and melanin-concentrating hormone in the perifornical lateral hypothalamus. The increased density of these peptide-expressing neurons, evident in newborn offspring as well as P15 offspring cross-fostered at birth to dams on the BD, led us to examine events that might be occurring in utero. During gestation, the HFD stimulated the proliferation of neuroepithelial and neuronal precursor cells of the embryonic hypothalamic third ventricle. It also stimulated the proliferation and differentiation of neurons and their migration toward hypothalamic areas where ultimately a greater proportion of the new neurons expressed the orexigenic peptides. This increase in neurogenesis, closely associated with a marked increase in lipids in the blood, may have a role in producing the long-term behavioral and physiological changes observed in offspring after weaning, including an increase in food intake, preference for fat, , and higher body weight.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29095654></a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29129236>Effects of betaine supplementation on nitric oxide metabolism, atherosclerotic parameters, and fatty liver in guinea pigs fed a high cholesterol plus methionine diet.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of high cholesterol (CHOL) and CHOL + methionine (MET) diets on atherogenic and oxidative index parameters and on the factors that influence nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability.

However, these changes were not clinically significant or progressive. No dose-related effects were observed in the incidence of abnormal renal test results in the total population of patients, or subpopulation of diabetic patients or patients with renal dysfunction at baseline. The incidence of acute kidney injury [serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dL (26.5 μM) increases from baseline or ≥1.5 × baseline] in 2'MOE ASO-treated patients (2.4%) was not statistically different from placebo (1.7%, P = 0.411). In conclusion, in this database, encompassing 32 clinical trials and 11 different 2'MOE ASOs, we found no evidence of clinically significant renal dysfunction up to 52 weeks of randomized-controlled treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18645051>Renin inhibitor aliskiren improves impaired nitric oxide bioavailability and protects against atherosclerotic changes.</a></h1><p>We investigated whether aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, improves NO bioavailability and protects against spontaneous atherosclerotic changes. We also examined the effects of cotreatment with aliskiren and valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, on the above-mentioned outcomes. Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits were treated with vehicle (control), aliskiren, valsartan, or aliskiren plus valsartan for 8 weeks. Then, acetylcholine-induced NO production was measured as a surrogate index of endothelium protective function, and both superoxide and vascular peroxynitrite were measured. Tetrahydrobiopterin in aortic segments was assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Plaque area was quantified by histology. Increase in plasma NO concentration in response to intra-aortic acetylcholine infusion was significantly greater in all of the test groups than in controls. Aliskiren+valsartan cotreatment increased acetylcholine-induced NO by 6.2 nmol/L, which was significantly higher than that with either aliskiren or valsartan alone. Vascular superoxide and peroxynitrite levels were both significantly higher in controls and significantly lower in the aliskiren+valsartan group than in the aliskiren or valsartan group. The highest tetrahydrobiopterin levels were observed after aliskiren+valsartan cotreatment. Histology of the thoracic aorta revealed that the plaque area was significantly decreased with combination therapy compared with monotherapy. Treatment with a direct renin inhibitor has protective effects on endothelial function and atherosclerotic changes. Furthermore, cotreatment with a direct renin inhibitor and an angiotensin II receptor blocker has additive protective effects on both.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30890623>Clinical Management of Adverse Events Associated with Lorlatinib.</a></h1><p>Lorlatinib is a novel, highly potent, brain-penetrant, third-generation ALK/ROS1  kinase inhibitor (TKI), which has broad-spectrum potency against most known resistance mutations that can develop during treatment with crizotinib and second-generation ALK TKIs. The safety profile of lorlatinib was established based on 295 patients who had received the recommended dose of lorlatinib 100 mg once daily. Adverse events associated with lorlatinib are primarily mild to moderate in severity, with hypercholesterolemia (82.4%), hypertriglyceridemia (60.7%), edema (51.2%), peripheral neuropathy (43.7%), and central nervous system effects (39.7%) among the most frequently reported. These can be effectively managed with dose modification and/or standard supportive medical therapy, as indicated by a low incidence of permanent discontinuations due to adverse reactions. Most patients (81.0%) received at least one lipid-lowering agent. Prescription of supportive therapy should also consider the potential for drug-drug interactions with lorlatinib via engagement of specific CYP450 enzymes. This article summarizes the clinical experience from lorlatinib phase I investigators and was generated from discussion and review of the clinical study protocol and database to provide an expert consensus opinion on the management of the key adverse reactions reported with lorlatinib, including , central nervous system effects, weight increase, edema, peripheral neuropathy, and gastrointestinal effects. Overall, lorlatinib 100 mg once daily has a unique safety profile to be considered when prescribed, based on the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with a second-generation ALK TKI. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Despite the advancement of second-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)  kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the emergence of resistance and progression of central nervous system metastases remain clinically significant problems in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. Lorlatinib is a potent, brain-penetrant, third-generation, macrocyclic ALK/ROS1 TKI, with broad-spectrum potency against most known resistance mutations that can develop during treatment with existing first- and second-generation ALK TKIs.

In the present study, we examined whether another metabolic disease, prolonged uremia, affects ischemia/reperfusion injury and cardioprotection by ischemic preconditioning. Uremia was induced by partial nephrectomy in male Wistar rats. The development of uremia was verified 29 wk after surgery. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to monitor cardiac function. At week 30, hearts of nephrectomized and sham-operated rats were isolated and subjected to a 30-min coronary occlusion followed by 120 min reperfusion with or without preceding preconditioning induced by three intermittent cycles of brief ischemia and reperfusion. In nephrectomized rats, plasma uric acid, carbamide, and creatinine as well as urine protein levels were increased as compared with sham-operated controls. Systolic anterior and septal wall thicknesses were increased in nephrectomized rats, suggesting the development of a minimal cardiac hypertrophy. Ejection fraction was decreased and isovolumic relaxation time was shortened in nephrectomized rats demonstrating a mild systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Infarct size was not affected significantly by nephrectomy itself. Ischemic preconditioning significantly decreased infarct size from 24.8 ± 5.2% to 6.6 ± 1.3% in the sham-operated group and also in the uremic group from 35.4 ± 9.5% to 11.9 ± 3.1% of the area at risk. Plasma ANG II and nitrotyrosine were significantly increased in the uremic rats. We conclude that although prolonged experimental uremia leads to severe metabolic changes and the development of a mild myocardial dysfunction, the cardioprotective effect of ischemic preconditioning is still preserved.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18599593>Endothelial and vascular dysfunctions and insulin resistance in rats fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet.</a></h1><p>This study was designed to examine the effects of a high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet on vascular and metabolic actions of insulin. Male rats were randomized to receive an HFHS or regular chow diet for 4 wk. In a first series of experiments, the rats had pulsed Doppler flow probes and intravascular catheters implanted to measure blood pressure, heart rate, and regional blood flows. Insulin sensitivity and vascular responses to insulin were assessed during a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp performed in conscious rats. In a second series of experiments, new groups of rats were used to examine skeletal muscle glucose transport activity and to determine in vitro vascular reactivity, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression in muscle and vascular tissues and endothelin content, nitrotyrosine formation, and NAD(P)H oxidase protein expression in vascular tissues. The HFHS-fed rats displayed insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, , elevated blood pressure, and impaired insulin-mediated renal and skeletal muscle vasodilator responses. A reduction in endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, accompanied by a decreased eNOS protein expression in muscles and blood vessel endothelium, and increased vascular endothelin-1 protein content were also noted in HFHS-fed rats compared with control rats. Furthermore, the HFHS diet induced a reduced insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity in muscles and increased levels of NAD(P)H oxidase protein and nitrotyrosine formation in vascular tissues. These findings support the importance of eNOS protein in linking metabolic and vascular disease and indicate the ability of a Westernized diet to induce endothelial dysfunction and to alter metabolic and vascular homeostasis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14593182>Prevention of organ allograft rejection by a specific Janus kinase 3 inhibitor.</a></h1><p>Because of its requirement for signaling by multiple cytokines, Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) is an excellent target for clinical immunosuppression. We report the development of a specific, orally active inhibitor of JAK3, CP-690,550, that significantly prolonged survival in a murine model of heart transplantation and in cynomolgus monkeys receiving kidney transplants. CP-690,550 treatment was not associated with hypertension, , or lymphoproliferative disease. On the basis of these preclinical results, we believe JAK3 blockade by CP-690,550 has potential for therapeutically desirable immunosuppression in human organ transplantation and in other clinical settings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23747249>Diet1 functions in the FGF15/19 enterohepatic signaling axis to modulate bile acid and lipid levels.</a></h1><p>We identified a mutation in the Diet1 gene in a mouse strain that is resistant to  and atherosclerosis. Diet1 encodes a 236 kD protein consisting of tandem low-density lipoprotein receptor and MAM (meprin-A5-protein  phosphatase mu) domains and is expressed in the enterocytes of the small intestine. Diet1-deficient mice exhibited an elevated bile acid pool size and impaired feedback regulation of hepatic Cyp7a1, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis. In mouse intestine and in cultured human intestinal cells, Diet1 expression levels influenced the production of fibroblast growth factor 15/19 (FGF15/19), a hormone that signals from the intestine to liver to regulate Cyp7a1. Transgenic expression of Diet1, or adenoviral-mediated Fgf15 expression, restored normal Cyp7a1 regulation in Diet-1-deficient mice. Diet1 and FGF19 proteins exhibited overlapping subcellular localization in cultured intestinal cells. These results establish Diet1 as a control point in enterohepatic bile acid signaling and lipid homeostasis.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The injury of vascular endothelium of these rats was observed after stimulation with FK506 or/and CsA. The mRNA transcription and protein expression of the vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF), decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and C reactive protein (CRP) in vascular endothelium of rats were measured. The serum reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected.Compared with FK506, CsA was more likely to cause injury of vascular endothelium, damaging the integrity of endothelium of hyperlipidemic rats. CsA inhibited the expression of VEGF and the complement inhibitor DAF and increased the expression of CRP of vascular endothelial cells. CsA also up-regulated the serum level of ROS. FK506 showed no such impacts.CsA can damage vascular endothelium of hyperlipidemic rats by activating the complement system induced by VEGF/DAF and ROS/CRP pathway. FK506 has no influence on the VEGF/DAF pathway and the expression of ROS/CRP.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22832337>Chlorpyrifos acute exposure induces hyperglycemia and  in rats.</a></h1><p>In this study we evaluated the hyperglycemic and hyperlipidemic effects of chlorpyrifos (CPF) after an acute exposure in rats. The mechanisms involved in hyperglycemia induced by CPF were studied. A single dose of CPF (50 mg kg(-1), subcutaneous, s.c.) was administered to overnight-fasted rats. Glucose and corticosterone levels, lipid status and paraoxonase (PON1) activity were determined in plasma of rats. Cardiovascular risk factors and the atherogenic index were calculated. Glycogen levels,  aminotransferase (TAT) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activities were determined in livers of rats. Cerebral acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was also determined. CPF caused an increase in glucose and glycogen levels as well as in TAT and G6Pase activities. The CPF exposure caused an increase in corticosterone levels, an inhibition of AChE activity and a reduction of PON1 activity. Regarding the lipid status, CPF induced an increase in triglycerides (TG) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL) levels and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels associated with an increase of cardiovascular risk factors and the atherogenic index. The present study demonstrated that a single CPF administration caused hyperglycemia and  in rats. The activation of the gluconeogenesis pathway, probably elicited by hypercorticosteronemia, is involved in the hyperglycemic effect of CPF in rats.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Separate groups of normal and hyperlipidemic rats were injected twice intraperitoneally with 2 x 20 micromol/kg FeTPPS (5,10,15,20-tetrakis-[4-sulfonatophenyl]-porphyrinato-iron[III]), a ONOO(-) decomposition catalyst, 24 h and 1 h before isolation of the hearts.A cholesterol diet significantly decreased myocardial NO content, however, myocardial Ca(2+)-dependent and Ca(2+)-independent NO synthase activity and NO synthase protein level did not change. Myocardial superoxide formation and xanthine oxidase activity were significantly increased; however, cardiac superoxide dismutase activity did not change in the cholesterol-fed group. Dityrosine in the perfusate, a marker of cardiac ONOO(-) formation, and plasma nitrotyrosine, a marker for systemic ONOO(-) formation, were both elevated in hyperlipidemic rats. In cholesterol-fed rats, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was significantly elevated as compared to controls. Administration of FeTPPS normalized LVEDP in the cholesterol-fed group.We conclude that cholesterol-enriched diet-induced  leads to an increase in cardiac ONOO(-) formation and a decrease in the bioavailability of NO which contributes to the deterioration of cardiac performance and may lead to further cardiac pathologies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12196346>Distinct renal injury in early atherosclerosis and renovascular disease.</a></h1><p>Atherosclerotic renovascular disease may augment deterioration of renal function and ischemic nephropathy compared with other causes of renal artery stenosis (RAS), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that concurrent early atherosclerosis and hypoperfusion might have greater early deleterious effects on the function and structure of the stenotic kidney.Regional renal hemodynamics and function at baseline and during vasoactive challenge (acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside) were quantified in vivo in pigs by electron-beam computed tomography after a 12-week normal (n=7) or hypercholesterolemic (HC, n=7) diet, RAS (n=6), or concurrent HC and a similar degree of RAS (HC+RAS, n=7). Flash-frozen renal tissue was studied ex vivo. Basal cortical perfusion and single-kidney glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were decreased similarly in the stenotic RAS and HC+RAS kidneys, but tubular fluid reabsorption was markedly impaired only in HC+RAS. Perfusion responses to challenge were similarly blunted in the experimental groups. Stimulated GFR increased in normal, HC, and RAS (38.3+/-3.6%, 36.4+/-7.6%, and 60.4+/-9.3%, respectively, P<0.05), but not in HC+RAS (6.5+/-15.1%). These functional abnormalities in HC+RAS were accompanied by augmented perivascular, tubulointerstitial, and glomerular fibrosclerosis, inflammation, systemic and tissue oxidative stress, and tubular expression of nuclear factor-kappaB and inducible nitric oxide synthase.Early chronic HC+RAS imposes distinct detrimental effects on renal function and structure in vivo and in vitro, evident primarily in the tubular and glomerular compartments. Increased oxidative stress may be involved in the proinflammatory and progrowth changes observed in the stenotic HC+RAS kidney, which might potentially facilitate the clinically observed progression to end-stage renal disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20596261>Hypothyroidism - new aspects of an old disease.</a></h1><p>Hypothyroidism is divided in primary, caused by failure of thyroid function and secondary (central) due to the failure of adequate thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion from the pituitary gland or thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. Secondary hypothyroidism can be differentiated in pituitary and hypothalamic by the use of TRH test. In some cases, failure of hormone action in peripheral tissues can be recognized. Primary hypothyroidism may be clinical, where free T(4) (FT(4)) is decreased and TSH is increased or subclinical where FT(4) is normal and TSH is increased. In secondary hypothyroidism FT(4) is decreased and TSH is normal or decreased. Primary hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, less common causes being radioiodine treatment and thyroidectomy. Salt iodination, which is performed routinely in many countries, may increase the incidence of overt hypothyroidism. The incidence of clinical hypothyroidism is 0.5-1.9% in women and <1% in men and of subclinical 3-13.6% in women and 0.7-5.7% in men. It is important to differentiate between clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism as in clinical symptoms are serious, even coma may occur, while in subclinical symptoms are less and may even be absent. Subclinical hypothyroidism may be transformed to clinical and as recent research has shown it may have various consequences, such as  and increased risk for the development of cardiovascular disease, even heart failure, somatic and neuromuscular symptoms, reproductive and other consequences. The administration of novel  kinase inhibitors for the treatment of neoplastic diseases may induce hypothyroidism.

However, the mechanisms responsible for their anti-inflammatory and antiatherosclerotic effects remain largely unknown. The present study tested the hypothesis that a PPARgamma agonist may exert significant endothelial protection by antioxidative and antinitrative effects.Male New Zealand White rabbits were randomized to receive a normal (control) or a high-cholesterol diet and treated with vehicle or rosiglitazone (a PPARgamma agonist) 3 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) for 5 weeks beginning 3 weeks after the high-cholesterol diet. At the end of 8 weeks of a high-cholesterol diet, the rabbits were killed, and the carotid arteries were isolated. Bioactive nitric oxide was determined functionally (endothelium-dependent vasodilatation) and biochemically (the phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, or P-VASP). Vascular superoxide production, PPARgamma, gp91phox, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, and vascular ONOO- formation were determined. Hypercholesterolemia caused severe endothelial dysfunction and reduced P-VASP, despite a marked increase in iNOS expression and total NOx production. Treatment with rosiglitazone enhanced PPARgamma expression, improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, preserved P-VASP, suppressed gp91phox and iNOS expression, reduced superoxide and total NOx production, and inhibited nitrotyrosine formation.The PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone exerted a significant vascular protective effect in hypercholesterolemic rabbits, most likely by attenuation of oxidative and nitrative stresses. The endothelial protective effects of PPARgamma agonists may reduce leukocyte accumulation in vascular walls and contribute to their antiatherosclerotic effect.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15090791>Ritonavir exhibits anti-atherogenic properties on vascular smooth muscle cells.</a></h1><p>HIV protease inhibitors (PI) such as ritonavir have dramatically decreased HIV-related morbidity and mortality. However they exhibit significant side-effects such as , hyperglycemia with or without lipodystrophy, which may increase patients' risk for atherosclerosis. Direct effects of PI on the vascular wall have not been investigated. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a major contributor to atherogenesis.In the present study the effects of ritonavir on PDGF-BB-induced responses of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were evaluated.PDGF-induced proliferation of VSMCs was measured by BrdU-incorporation, and chemotaxis was assessed by utilizing modified Boyden chambers. Cytotoxicity and apoptosis were quantified using LDH-release- and apoptosis-kits. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses were performed to evaluate betaPDGF receptor (betaPDGFR) expression and phosphorylation, and to monitor intracellular signaling.Pretreatment of VSMCs with ritonavir resulted in a significant concentration-dependent inhibition of PDGF-BB-induced cellular responses. At a therapeutic concentration (10 microg/ml), ritonavir significantly reduced PDGF-induced DNA synthesis and chemotaxis by 46.8 +/- 5.5% and 37.2 +/- 3.3%, respectively (P < 0.05 each). In addition it significantly inhibited PDGF-dependent downstream signaling, such as Erk activation. These inhibitory effects were not due to cytotoxicity or apoptosis. Instead, ritonavir inhibited the ligand-induced  phosphorylation of the betaPDGFR, whereas it did not alter betaPDGFR expression.Ritonavir has direct effects on VSMCs at clinically relevant concentrations in vitro, as it inhibits betaPDGFR activation and PDGF-dependent proliferation and migration of VSMCs. Although ritonavir may increase the risk of vascular disease by its metabolic side effects, it may exhibit anti-atherogenic properties on the cellular level.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12890174>Biochemical and morphological characterization of spontaneously hypertensive hyperlipidaemic rats.</a></h1><p>1.

A new strain of spontaneously hypertensive hyperlipidaemic rats (SHHR) was established at generation 10 through selective mating of brothers and sisters (systolic blood pressure > 150 mmHg, plasma cholesterol > 150 mg/dL). Cross-bred Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (SDWKY rats) were used as a control. 3. Adrenaline and noradrenaline levels in the plasma and adrenal medulla of male SHHR were significantly higher than those of male SDWKY rats. The  hydroxylase activity in the adrenal medulla of male SHHR was significantly higher than that of male SDWKY rats. Low-density lipoprotein expression was found in the plasma of male and female SHHR and HLR. Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase mRNA expression in the liver of male SHHR was lower than that of male SDWKY rats. Endothelium lesions and lipid deposition under the endothelium were observed in the aorta of 24-month-old SHHR, especially female SHHR, but not in age-matched HLR and SDWKY rats. 4.

Therefore, popularly used apolipoprotein E knockout mice are not suitable to evaluate PPAR-α agonists. In this study, we aimed to: a) evaluate hamster as a model for insulin resistance,  and atherosclerosis; and b) investigate the effect of a PPAR-α activator, fenofibrate, in this model. A high fat high cholesterol (HFHC) diet increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides, but inclusion of fenofibrate in the diet decreased cholesterol and proatherogenic lipoproteins, VLDL and LDL, in a time-dependent manner. Concomitantly, serum levels of triglycerides also decreased. These reductions were attributed, in part, to the down-regulation of lipogenic genes and upregulation of lipoprotein lipase. The HFHC diet caused body weight gain and mild insulin resistance, both of which were prevented following the treatments with fenofibrate. Insulin resistance was further investigated in high fructose-fed hamsters. Fenofibrate prevented both hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia. The insulin sensitizing activity of fenofibrate appeared to occur via reductions in protein  phophatase-1B. To determine whether lowering of lipids by fenofibrate treatment contributed to the reduced risks of developing atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic hamsters, we measured lipid deposition in the aorta. Our results showed that fenofibrate treatment reduced aortic lipid deposition by 70%. These findings suggest that hamster may be an adequate animal model to evaluate the efficacy of lipid lowering, insulin sensitizing and antiatherosclerotic agents. We also show that fenofibrate is an effective antiatherosclerotic agent in hyperlipidemic hamster model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11514839>A high-fructose diet induces insulin resistance but not blood pressure changes in normotensive rats.</a></h1><p>Rats fed a high-fructose diet represent an animal model for insulin resistance and hypertension. We recently showed that a high-fructose diet containing vegetable oil but a normal sodium/potassium ratio induced mild insulin resistance with decreased insulin receptor substrate-1  phosphorylation in the liver and muscle of normal rats. In the present study, we examined the mean blood pressure, serum lipid levels and insulin sensitivity by estimating in vivo insulin activity using the 15-min intravenous insulin tolerance test (ITT, 0.5 ml of 6 microg insulin, iv) followed by calculation of the rate constant for plasma glucose disappearance (Kitt) in male Wistar-Hannover rats (110-130 g) randomly divided into four diet groups: control, 1:3 sodium/potassium ratio (R Na:K) diet (C 1:3 R Na:K); control, 1:1 sodium/potassium ratio diet (CNa 1:1 R Na:K); high-fructose, 1:3 sodium/potassium ratio diet (F 1:3 R Na:K), and high-fructose, 1:1 sodium/potassium ratio diet (FNa 1:1 R Na:K) for 28 days. The change in R Na:K for the control and high-fructose diets had no effect on insulin sensitivity measured by ITT. In contrast, the 1:1 R Na:K increased blood pressure in rats receiving the control and high-fructose diets from 117 +/- 3 and 118 +/- 3 mmHg to 141 +/- 4 and 132 +/- 4 mmHg (P < 0.05), respectively. Triacylglycerol levels were higher in both groups treated with a high-fructose diet when compared to controls (C 1:3 R Na:K: 1.2 +/- 0.1 mmol/l vs F 1:3 R Na:K: 2.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/l and CNa 1:1 R Na:K: 1.2 +/- 0.2 mmol/l vs FNa 1:1 R Na:K: 2.6 +/- 0.4 mmol/l, P < 0.05). These data suggest that fructose alone does not induce hyperinsulinemia or hypertension in rats fed a normal R Na:K diet, whereas an elevation of sodium in the diet may contribute to the elevated blood pressure in this animal model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12860913>Statins promote potent systemic antioxidant effects through specific inflammatory pathways.</a></h1><p>The pleiotropic actions of hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) include antiinflammatory and antioxidant actions. We recently reported that statins induce reductions in plasma protein levels of nitrotyrosine (NO2Tyr), a modification generated by nitric oxide-derived oxidants. Whether alternative oxidative pathways are suppressed in vivo after statin administration has not yet been reported.As an extension of our prior study, hypercholesterolemic subjects with no known coronary artery disease were evaluated at baseline and after 12 weeks of atorvastatin therapy (10 mg/d). Plasma levels of protein-bound chlorotyrosine, NO2Tyr, dityrosine, and orthotyrosine, specific molecular fingerprints for distinct oxidative pathways upregulated in atheroma, were determined by mass spectrometry. In parallel, alterations in lipoproteins and C-reactive protein were determined. Statin therapy caused significant reductions in chlorotyrosine, NO2Tyr, and dityrosine (30%, 25%, and 32%, respectively; P<0.02 each) that were similar in magnitude to reductions in total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B-100 (25% and 29%, P<0.001 each). Nonsignificant decreases in orthotyrosine and C-reactive protein levels were observed (9% and 11%, respectively; P>0.10 each). Statin-induced reductions in oxidation markers were independent of decreases in lipids and lipoproteins.Statins promote potent systemic antioxidant effects through suppression of distinct oxidation pathways. The major pathways inhibited include formation of myeloperoxidase-derived and nitric oxide-derived oxidants, species implicated in atherogenesis. The present results suggest potential mechanisms that may contribute to the beneficial actions of statins. They also have important implications for monitoring the antiinflammatory and antioxidant actions of these agents.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17292425>Signaling pathways involved in OxPAPC-induced pulmonary endothelial barrier protection.</a></h1><p>Increased tissue or serum levels of oxidized phospholipids have been detected in a variety of chronic and acute pathological conditions such as , atherosclerosis, heart attack, cell apoptosis, acute inflammation and injury. We have recently described signaling cascades activated by oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (OxPAPC)in the human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (EC) and reported potent barrier-protective effects of OxPAPC, which were mediated by small GTPases Rac and Cdc42. In this study we have further characterized signal transduction pathways involved in the OxPAPC-mediated endothelial barrier protection. Inhibitors of small GTPases, protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), Src family kinases and general inhibitors of  kinases attenuated OxPAPC-induced barrier-protective response and EC cytoskeletal remodeling. In contrast, small GTPase Rho, Rho kinase, Erk-1,2 MAP kinase and p38 MAP kinase and PI3-kinase were not involved in the barrier-protective effects of OxPAPC. Inhibitors of PKA, PKC,  kinases and small GTPase inhibitor toxin B suppressed OxPAPC-induced Rac activation and decreased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin. Barrier-protective effects of OxPAPC were not reproduced by platelet activating factor (PAF), which at high concentrations induced barrier dysfunction, but were partially attenuated by PAF receptor antagonist A85783. These results demonstrate for the first time upstream signaling cascades involved in the OxPAPC-induced Rac activation, cytoskeletal remodeling and barrier regulation and suggest PAF receptor-independent mechanisms of OxPAPC-mediated endothelial barrier protection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16801563>Modulating role of estradiol on arginase II expression in hyperlipidemic rabbits as an atheroprotective mechanism.</a></h1><p>We evaluated the effects of a 0.5% cholesterol-enriched diet (HCD) on nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) and arginase expression and the modulating role of 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) on this phenomenon. Thirty oopherectomized rabbits were divided into three groups and treated for 15 weeks. Group I received normal chow; group II, HCD; and group III, HCD plus E(2) pellets. Animals in group II showed an increase in plasma lipids, and they demonstrated atheromatous lesions as well as expression of arginase I and II accompanied by a significant number of BrdU-positive cells in endothelial cells and intimal muscle cells, suggestive of an increase in cellular proliferation. There was significant expression of inducible NOS and increased staining of nitrotyrosine-positive areas. These were not observed in group I animals. In both groups, E(2) levels were low. In group III animals, E(2) supplementation led to a decrease in atheromatous lesions and BrdU-positive cells and reduced expression of both inducible NOS and arginase I and II accompanied by a decrease in nitrotyrosine staining. E(2) levels were increased. Our results suggest that E(2) was responsible for these effects, despite the animals being hyperlipidemic, similar to those in group II. Because arginase is responsible for cell proliferation by converting l-arginine to polyamines, our results indicate that expression of arginase may play an important role in cellular proliferation in atherosclerosis, and inhibition of arginase expression by E(2) may be another potential mechanism in attenuating atherogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20076942>Insulin resistance is associated with a metabolic profile  of altered protein metabolism in Chinese  and Asian-Indian men.</a></h1><p>Insulin resistance (IR) is associated with obesity, but can also develop in individuals with normal body weight. We employed comprehensive profiling methods to identify metabolic events associated with IR, while controlling for obesity.We selected 263 non-obese (BMI approximately 24 kg/m2) Asian-Indian and Chinese men from a large cross-sectional study carried out in Singapore. Individuals taking medication for diabetes or  were excluded. Participants were separated into lower and upper tertiles of IR based on HOMA indices of < or =1.06 or > or =1.93, respectively. MS-based metabolic profiling of acylcarnitines, amino acids and organic acids was combined with hormonal and cytokine profiling in all participants.After controlling for BMI, commonly accepted risk factors for IR, including circulating fatty acids and inflammatory cytokines, did not discriminate the upper and lower quartiles of insulin sensitivity in either Asian- Indian or Chinese men. Instead, IR was correlated with increased levels of alanine, proline, valine, leucine/isoleucine, phenylalanine, , glutamate/glutamine and ornithine, and a cluster of branched-chain and related amino acids identified by principal components analysis. These changes were not due to increased protein intake by individuals in the upper quartile of IR. Increased abdominal adiposity and leptin, and decreased adiponectin and IGF-binding protein 1 were also correlated with IR.These findings demonstrate that perturbations in amino acid homeostasis, but not inflammatory markers or NEFAs, are associated with IR in individuals of relatively low body mass.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11912545>Treatment with atorvastatin ameliorates hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein overproduction in an animal model of insulin resistance, the fructose-fed Syrian golden hamster: evidence that reduced hypertriglyceridemia is accompanied by improved hepatic insulin sensitivity.</a></h1><p>A novel animal model of insulin resistance, the fructose-fed Syrian golden hamster has been previously documented to exhibit considerable hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) overproduction concomitant with the development of whole body insulin resistance. Here, we investigated whether hepatic lipoprotein overproduction can be ameliorated by treatment with a hydroxymethyl glutaryl conenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin, using a series of ex vivo experiments. Hamsters were fed a fructose-enriched diet for 14 days to induce a state of insulin resistance, and then continued on a fructose-enriched diet supplemented with or without 40 mg/kg atorvastatin per day for 14 days. Fructose feeding in the first 2 weeks caused a significant increase in plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. There was a significant decline in plasma triglyceride levels following supplementation with the inhibitor (50% to 59%; P <.05). Experiments with primary hepatocytes revealed a decreased VLDL-apolipoprotein B (apoB) production (37.4% +/- 10.4%; P <.05) in hamsters treated with atorvastatin. Interestingly, atorvastatin treatment partially attenuated (by 23%) the elevated hepatic level of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) induced by fructose feeding. There was molecular evidence of improved hepatic insulin sensitivity with atorvastatin treatment based on assessment of the phosphorylation status of the insulin receptor and the expression of protein  phosphatase-1B. The improvement in insulin signaling was not mediated by a change in hepatic triglyceride accumulation as no significant difference was observed in liver triglyceride levels. Taken together, these data suggest that statins can ameliorate the VLDL-apoB overproduction state observed in a fructose-fed, insulin-resistant hamster model, and may potentially contribute to an enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity.Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA).

A total of 36 myocardial infarction-prone Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHLMI) rabbits equally derived (n=6 per group) were treated with 1) vehicle (control), 2) hydralazine (15 mg/kg/d), 3) the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pitavastatin (P: 0.5 mg/kg/d), 4) the ARB valsartan (V: 5 mg/kg/d), and 5) pitavastatin+valsartan (P+V) together without or 6) with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) for 8 weeks. After treatment, acetylcholine (ACh)-induced NO production was measured as a surrogate for endothelium protective function, and vascular peroxynitrite (a product of superoxide and NO) was measured for assessing dysfunctional endothelial NO synthase activity. Plaque area was quantified by histology as well as optical coherence tomography (OCT). Intra-aortic infusion of ACh produced an increase in plasma NO concentration, which was significantly greater with all drug treatments than with the control. P+V increased ACh-induced NO by 4.1 nmol/L significantly more than either P or V singly. The vascular peroxynitrite concentration was 1.6 pmol/mg protein in the control group and significantly less than those in the P- and V-monotherapy-groups. The lowest peroxynitrite concentration was observed in the P+V group (0.4 pmol/mg protein), which was significantly lower than those in the P- and the V-monotherapy-groups. OCT and histology of the thoracic aorta revealed that the plaque area decreased significantly more with the combination than with the monotherapy. In conclusion, the combined treatment with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and an ARB may have additive protective effects on endothelial function as well as atherosclerotic change.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25944577>Serum lipids and cardiac function correlate with nitrotyrosine and MMP activity in coronary artery disease patients.</a></h1><p>Peroxynitrite-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) signalling has been shown to contribute to myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury and heart failure and to be influenced by  in preclinical models. Therefore, here we investigated the correlation between the markers of peroxynitrite-MMP signalling and  in patients with significant coronary stenosis.Five minutes before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), arterial blood samples were collected from 36 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) selected for elective PCI.Serum nitrotyrosine positively correlated with MMP-9 activity (r = 0·54, P = 0·01), but not with MMP-2 activity. Nitrotyrosine positively correlated with total (r = 0·58; P < 0·01) and LDL cholesterol (r = 0·55; P < 0·01), serum triglyceride (r = 0·47; P < 0·05), and creatinine (r = 0·42; P < 0·05) and negatively correlated with HDL cholesterol (r = -0·46; P < 0·05) and with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; r = -0·55; P < 0·05), respectively. MMP-2 activity correlated positively with total (r = 0·55; P < 0·05) and LDL cholesterol (r = 0·45; P < 0·05). In statin-treated patients, a significantly reduced serum nitrotyrosine was found as compared to statin naives; however, MMP activities and serum cholesterol levels were not different. MMP-9 activity correlated with urea nitrogen (r = 0·42; P < 0·05) and LVEF (r = -0·73; P < 0·01). Serum creatinine correlated negatively with LVEF (r = -0·50, P < 0·01).This is the first demonstration that (i) serum nitrotyrosine correlates with MMP-9 activity, (ii) lipid parameters correlate with nitrotyrosine and MMP-2 activity, (iii) myocardial function correlates with creatinine, nitrotyrosine and MMP-9 activity, and (iv) creatinine correlates with nitrotyrosine and urea nitrogen with MMP-9 activity in patients with CAD.

The urinary metabolites hawkinsin, quinolacetic acid, and pyroglutamic acid can aid in identifying this condition, although their relationship to the clinical manifestations is not known. Herein we describe clinical and laboratory findings in two fraternal twins with hawkinsinuria who presented with failure to thrive and metabolic acidosis. Close clinical follow-up and laboratory testing revealed previously unrecognized hypoglycemia, hypophosphatemia, combined , and anemia, along with the characteristic urinary metabolites, including massive pyroglutamic aciduria. Treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) restored normal growth and normalized or improved most biochemical parameters. The dramatic response to NAC therapy supports the idea that glutathione depletion plays a key role in the pathogenesis of hawkinsinuria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22473497>Fenofibrate down-regulates renal OCT2-mediated organic cation transport via PPARα-independent pathways.</a></h1><p>Fibrate drugs, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) agonists, are widely prescribed for the treatment of . The present study examined the effect of fibrate drugs on renal OCT2 activity in a heterologous cell system [Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells stably transfected with rabbit (rb) OCT2], LLC-PK1, and intact mouse renal cortical slices. We found that both in the CHO-K1 cells expressing rbOCT2 and in LLC-PK1 cells, fenofibrate significantly inhibited [³H]-MPP⁺ uptake whereas clofibrate and WY14643 had no effect. Surprisingly, the inhibitory effect of fenofibrate was not attenuated by GW6471, a PPARα antagonist, indicating that the inhibitory process observed was via a PPARα-independent pathway. Fenofibrate decreased [³H]-MPP⁺ uptakes through a reduction of the maximal transport (J(max)) but without effect on the transporter affinity (K(t)) corresponding to a decrease in membrane expression of OCT2. Since the inhibitory effect of fenofibrate was not prevented by pretreatment with cycloheximide, its inhibitory action did not involve an inhibition of protein synthesis. Similar to the effect seen in the cell-cultured system, the inhibitory effect of fenofibrate was also observed in intact renal cortical slices. Taken together, our data showed that fenofibrate decreased the activity of OCT2 by reducing the number of functional transporters on the membrane, which is likely to be a PPARα-independent pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15051643>Antioxidant intervention attenuates myocardial neovascularization in hypercholesterolemia.</a></h1><p>Hypercholesterolemia (HC) and atherosclerosis can elicit oxidative stress, coronary endothelial dysfunction, and myocardial ischemia, which may induce growth-factor expression and lead to myocardial neovascularization. We tested the hypothesis that chronic antioxidant intervention in HC would attenuate neovascularization and preserve the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).Three groups of pigs (n=6 each) were studied after 12 weeks of normal or 2% HC diet or HC+antioxidant supplementation (100 IU/kg vitamin E and 1 g vitamin C daily). Myocardial samples were scanned ex vivo with a novel 3D micro-CT scanner, and the spatial density and tortuosity of myocardial microvessels were determined in situ. VEGF mRNA, protein levels of VEGF and VEGF receptor-1, HIF-1alpha, nitrotyrosine, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined in myocardial tissue. The HC and HC+antioxidant groups had similar increases in serum cholesterol levels. HC animals showed an increase in subendocardial spatial density of microvessels compared with normal (160.5+/-11.8 versus 95.3+/-8.2 vessels/cm2, P<0.05), which was normalized in HC+antioxidant (92.5+/-20.5 vessels/cm2, P<0.05 versus HC), as was arteriolar tortuosity. In addition, HC induced upregulation of VEGF, HIF-1alpha, and nitrotyrosine expression and decreased SOD expression and activity, all of which were preserved by antioxidant intervention.Changes in myocardial microvascular architecture invoked by HC are accompanied by increases in HIF-1alpha and VEGF expression and attenuated by antioxidant intervention. This underscores a role of increased oxidative stress in modulating myocardial microvascular architecture in early atherogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17264950>Platelet activation by collagen is increased in retinal vein occlusion.</a></h1><p>Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the most common retinal vascular disorder second to diabetic retinopathy. The main risk factors in patients with RVO are hypertension, diabetes, , increased blood viscosity and glaucoma. The pathogenesis of RVO has not yet been clarified. In these events platelets could play a very important role. In the present study the platelet response to collagen was deeply investigated. Experiments were carried out on a selected group of RVO patients, which were compared to a group of healthy subjects matched for age, sex, clinical and metabolic characteristics. In resting and activated platelets of both groups of subjects p72syk phosphorylation, phospholipase Cgamma2 phosphorylation, protein kinase C activation, intra-cellular calcium levels and nitric oxide formation were measured. Results show that platelets of patients were more responsive to collagen or ADP than healthy subjects and that the response was significantly different (p < 0.0005) at low concentrations of these agonists. In platelets of patients stimulated with collagen increased phosphorylation of p72syk and phospholipase Cgamma2 was found. Also protein kinase C was more activated in patients. In addition intracellular calcium rise induced by collagen was significantly higher in patients than in healthy subjects. RVO patients showed a lower basal level of nitric oxide both in resting and stimulated platelets compared to healthy subjects. Altogether these results suggest that the platelet hyperaggregability described in patients might be an important factor in the development of RVO contributing to the thrombogenic effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12970256>Inhibition of the cardiac angiogenic response to surgical FGF-2 therapy in a Swine endothelial dysfunction model.</a></h1><p>Discrepancy exists between the potent effects of therapeutic angiogenesis in laboratory animals and the marginal results observed in patients with advanced coronary artery disease. In vitro and small animal data suggest that angiogenesis may depend on locally available nitric oxide (NO), but the impact of endothelial dysfunction on therapeutic angiogenesis in the myocardium has been unclear. We compared the effects of clinically applicable angiogenesis methods in swine in which endothelial dysfunction was experimentally induced to that observed in normal swine.Miniswine were fed either a regular (N=13) or hypercholesterolemic diet (N=13) for 20 weeks. Hypercholesterolemic swine showed coronary endothelial dysfunction on videomicroscopy. Animals from both groups received 100 microg of perivascular sustained-release fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 in the lateral myocardial territory, previously made ischemic by placement of an ameroid constrictor around the circumflex artery. After 4 weeks of FGF-2 therapy, lateral myocardial perfusion was significantly lower in hypercholesterolemic than in normocholesterolemic swine, both at rest and during pacing (0.44+/-0.04 versus 0.81+/-0.15 mL/min/g at rest, respectively; P=0.006; and 0.50+/-0.06 versus 0.71+/-0.10 mL/min/g during pacing; P=0.02). Hypercholesterolemic swine showed no net increase in perfusion from FGF-2 treatment. Endothelial cell density and FGF receptor-1 expression were significantly lower in the lateral territory of hypercholesterolemic versus normocholesterolemic animals.The cardiac angiogenic response to FGF-2 treatment using clinically applicable methods was markedly inhibited in hypercholesterolemic swine with coronary endothelial dysfunction. These findings suggest that coronary endothelial dysfunction is major obstacle to the efficacy of clinical angiogenesis protocols and constitutes a target toward making angiogenesis more effective in patients with advanced coronary disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21372295>Early inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis are induced by proline-rich  kinase/reactive oxygen species-mediated release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and subsequent activation of the p21Cip1/Ets-1/p300 system.</a></h1><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the initial process of atherosclerosis, whereas it remains to be determined how atherogenic stimulus causes ROS-mediated proinflammatory reactions. Here, we focused on proline-rich  kinase (PYK2)-mediated ROS generation and examined how atherogenic stimulus causes early proinflammatory reactions.PYK2-deficient (knockout [KO]) (PYK2-KO) mice were crossbred with apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient (PYK2-KO/ApoE-KO) mice. PYK2-KO/ApoE-KO mice and endothelial cells (EC) were used for the study. Aortic atherogenic lesions in PYK2-KO/ApoE-KO mice were markedly decreased (55% versus ApoE-KO) after 8 weeks of a Western diet. Aortic PYK2 was activated as early as 7 days after the Western diet, when inflammatory cells were not yet activated. Addition of the proatherogenic oxidized phospholipid lysophosphatidylcholine caused activation of endothelial PYK2. Lysophosphatidylcholine-activated PYK2 induced NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS generation and ROS-mediated synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and p21Cip1/Ets-1. Neutralizing anti-TNFα antibody or knockdown of p21Cip1/Ets-1 system blocked the induction of VCAM-1 and MCP-1. PYK2 deficiency abolished these ROS-mediated proinflammatory reactions. Further analysis revealed that PYK2/ROS-mediated p21Cip1/Ets-1 activation upregulated the transcription of the MCP-1 gene in collaboration with p300 transcription coactivator.PYK2 is a key  kinase activated by high cholesterol exposure, which causes ROS-mediated TNFα release and induces TNFα-dependent expression of proinflammatory molecules via the p21Cip1/Ets-1/p300 transcription system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28750643>Isolated hypercholesterolemia leads to steatosis in the liver without affecting the pancreas.</a></h1><p>Lipid accumulation in the liver and pancreas is primarily caused by combined . However, the effect of isolated hypercholesterolemia without hypertriglyceridemia is not fully described. Therefore, our aim was to investigate whether hypercholesterolemia alone leads to alterations both in hepatic and pancreatic lipid panel and histology in rats.Male Wistar rats were fed with 2% cholesterol +0.25% cholate-supplemented diet or standard chow for 12 weeks. Blood was collected at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12 to measure serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. At week 12, both the pancreas and the liver were isolated for further histological and biochemical analysis. Hepatic and plasma fatty acid composition was assessed by gas chromatography. Expression of mRNA of major enzymes involved in saturated/unsaturated fatty acid synthesis was analyzed by qPCR. In separate experiments serum enzyme activities and insulin levels were measured at week 9.At week 12, rats fed with 2% cholesterol +0.25% cholate-supplemented diet were characterized by elevated serum cholesterol (4.09 ± 0.20 vs. 2.89 ± 0.22 mmol/L, *p < 0.05) while triglyceride (2.27 ± 0.05 vs. 2.03 ± 0.03 mmol/L) and glucose levels (5.32 ± 0.14 vs. 5.23 ± 0.10 mmol/L) remained unchanged. Isolated hypercholesterolemia increased hepatic lipid accumulation, hepatic cholesterol (5.86 ± 0.22 vs. 1.60 ± 0.15 ng/g tissue, *p < 0.05) and triglyceride contents (19.28 ± 1.42 vs. 6.78 ± 0.71 ng/g tissue, *p < 0.05), and hepatic nitrotyrosine level (4.07 ± 0.52 vs. 2.59 ± 0.31 ng/mg protein, *p < 0.05). The histology and tissue lipid content of the pancreas was not affected. Serum total protein level, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities remained unchanged in response to isolated hypercholesterolemia while serum alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) significantly increased. Plasma insulin levels did not change in response to isolated hypercholesterolemia suggesting an intact endocrine function of the pancreas. Isolated hypercholesterolemia caused a significantly increased hepatic and serum fatty acid level associated with a marked alteration of fatty acid composition. Hepatic expression of Δ9-desaturase (SCD1) was increased 4.92×, while expression of Δ5-desaturase and Δ6-desaturase were decreased (0.447× and 0.577×, respectively) due to isolated hypercholesterolemia.Isolated hypercholesterolemia leads to hepatic steatosis and marked alterations in the hepatic lipid profile without affecting the pancreas. Altered fatty acid profile might mediate harmful effects of cholesterol in the liver.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29299589>Hypolipidemic effect and protection ability of liver-kidney functions of melanin from Lachnum YM226 in high-fat diet fed mice.</a></h1><p>In the present study, we investigated the hypolipidemic properties of melanin from Lachnum YM226 (LM) in high-fat diet induced hyperlipidemic mice. After the hyperlipidemic model was established, mice were randomly divided into six groups, as follows: normal control group (NC), hyperlipidemic control group (HC), positive control group (7 mg kg d simvastatin) (PC) and LM groups (50, 100 and 200 mg kg d denoted as LM-50, LM-100 and LM-200, respectively). Subsequently, the body weight, organ indices, lipid metabolism, antioxidant properties and liver-kidney functions of the mice were examined. Moreover, the activities of lipoprotein metabolism enzymes in serum and liver tissue were examined to study the feasible mechanism. The results imply that LM could effectively reduce body weight, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and atherogenic index (AI), and increase high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Moreover, treatment with LM also increased the antioxidant enzymes activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content relative to the HC group. In addition, the liver and kidney damage indices such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), creatinine (CRE), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and uric acid were lowered. LM administration also significantly corrected disturbances of liver-kidney functions with no fatty deposits in the liver, resulting in a protective effect against renal histological alteration. The hypolipidemic effect occurred partly due to the regulation of hepatic lipase (HL) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in serum and liver to markedly decrease TG. This confirms the important role of LM in the prevention of .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18663085>Apolipoprotein CIII links  with vascular endothelial cell dysfunction.</a></h1><p>Apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) is a component of some triglyceride-rich very-low-density and low-density lipoprotein and is elevated in dyslipidemia with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. We previously reported that apoCIII directly activates proinflammatory and atherogenic signaling in vascular endothelial cells through protein kinase C-beta (PKCbeta). Because PKCbeta impairs the response of vascular endothelial cells to insulin, we tested the hypothesis that apoCIII affects insulin signaling in vascular endothelial cells and its function in vitro and in vivo.ApoCIII inhibited insulin-induced  phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), decreasing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt activation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These effects of apoCIII led to reduced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and NO release into the media. ApoCIII activated PKCbeta in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, resulting in IRS-1 dysfunction via serine phosphorylation. ApoCIII also activated mitogen-activated protein kinase through PKCbeta. The impaired insulin signaling was restored by PKCbeta inhibitor or MEK1 inhibitor. ApoCIII-rich very-low-density lipoprotein and apoCIII impaired insulin signaling in the aorta of C57BL/6J mice and in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which was recovered by PKCbeta inhibitor. They also inhibited endothelium-dependent relaxation of the aortas of C57BL/6J mice. In summary, apoCIII in very-low-density lipoprotein impaired insulin stimulation of NO production by vascular endothelium and induced endothelial dysfunction in vivo. This adverse effect of apoCIII was mediated by its activation of PKCbeta, which inhibits the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway.Our results suggest that apoCIII is a crucial link between dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in vascular endothelial cells with consequential deleterious effects on their atheroprotective functions.</p></html>
