Optimized structures of the 1:1 complexes and ΔHbinding for calcium binding as calculated by density functional theory (DFT) confirmed in all complexes a stronger calcium binding and shorter calcium-oxygen bond length in the deprotonated form. In addition, the stronger calcium binding was also accompanied by a binding site shift from carboxylate binding to chelation by α-amino group and carboxylate oxygen for leucine, aspartate, glutamate, alanine, and asparagine. For binary amino acid mixtures, the calcium-binding constant was close to the predicted geometric mean of the individual amino acid binding constants indicating separate binding of calcium to two amino acids when present together in solution. At high pH, corresponding to conditions for calcium absorption, the binding affinity increased in the order  <  < Cys < Gln < Gly ∼ Ala < Asn < His < Leu < Glu< Asp. In a series of glycine peptides, calcium-binding affinity was found to increase in the order Gly-Leu ∼ Gly-Gly < Ala-Gly < Gly-His ∼ Gly--Gly < Glu- < Gly-Glu, an ordering confirmed by DFT calculations for the dipeptides and which also accounted for large synergistic effects in calcium binding for up to 6 kJ/mol when compared to the corresponding amino acid mixtures.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9446726>Purification and structural characterization of insulin and glucagon from the bichir Polypterus senegalis (Actinopterygii: Polypteriformes).</a></h1><p>The Polypteriformes (bichirs and reedfish) are a family of ray-finned fishes of ancient lineage. Insulin has been isolated from an extract of the pancreas and upper gastrointestinal tract of the bichir Polypterus senegalis and its primary structure established as A-chain: Gly-Ile-Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys-Asp-Thr-Pro10-Cys-Ser- Leu-Tyr-Asp-Leu-Glu-Asn-Tyr-Cys20-Asn: B-chain: Ala-Ala-Asn--His-Leu--Ser-His10-Leu-Val- Glu-Ala-Leu-Tyr-Leu-Val-Cys-Gly20-Asn--Gly-Phe- Phe-Tyr-Ile-Pro-Ser-Lys30-Met. Despite the fact that Polypterus insulin contains several unusual structural features that are not found in insulins from other jawed fish (Asp at A-8, Thr at A-9,  at B-4, Asn at B-21, Ile at B-27, Met at B-31), all the residues in human insulin that are involved in receptor binding, dimerization, and hexamerization have been conserved. A comparison of the structures of insulins from a range of species indicates that Polypterus insulin most closely resembles paddlefish insulin II (seven amino acid substitutions). In contrast, Polypterus glucagon (His-Ser- Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Asn-Asp-Tyr10-Thr--Tyr- Gln-Asp-Ser---Ala-Gln20-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln- Trp-Leu-Met-Ser-Asn) most closely resembles the glucagons from the gar Lepisosteus spatula and the bowfin Amia calva (four amino acid substitutions). The data are consistent with the conclusion based on comparison of morphological characteristics that the Polypterids are the most basal living group of the Actinopterygians with evolutionary connections to both the Acipenserids and the Neopterygians.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9204362>Purification and structural characterization of insulin from the lesser siren, Siren intermedia (Amphibia: Caudata).</a></h1><p>Insulin has been isolated from an extract of the pancreas of a salamander, the lesser siren Siren intermedia, and its primary structure was established as: A-chain, Gly-Ile-Val- Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys-His-Asn-Thr10-Cys-Ser-Leu-Tyr-Gln-Leu-Glu-Asn-Tyr- Cys20-Asn, and B-chain, Val-Pro-Asn--Pro- Leu--Ala-His10-Leu-Val-Glu-Val-Met-Tyr-Phe-Val- Cys-Gly20-Asp--Gly-Phe-Phe-Tyr-Pro-Ser-Ser-Thr 30. Although those amino acid residues considered to constitute the receptor-binding region of insulin have been retained, siren insulin contains several substitutions (Gln--> at B4, Ser-->Ala at B9, Ala-->Val at B14, Leu-->Met at B15, Leu-->Phe at B17, Pro-->Ser at B28, and -->Ser at B29) of amino acid residues that are conserved in insulins from species of other amphibian orders. The biological activity of siren insulin was not investigated in this study but the substitutions at B28 (involved in dimer formation) and at B14 and B17 (involved in hexamer formation) may be expected to influence conformation and therefore biological potency. The data are consistent with the view that the Sirenoidea represent an early divergence from the ancestral stock of salamanders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9650713>Isolation and characterization of insulin in Russian sturgeon (Acipenser guldenstaedti).</a></h1><p>Insulin was isolated from the pancreas of Chondrostean fish, the Russian sturgeon, Acipenser guldenstaedti, by acid-ethanol extraction followed by ion-exchange and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographies. The amino acid sequence determined by automated Edman degradation is as follows: A-chain (21-amino-acid peptide), H-Gly-Ile-Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys-His-Ser-Pro-Cys-Ser-Leu-Tyr-Asp-Leu-Glu-As n-Tyr-Cys-Asn-OH; and B-chain (31-amino-acid peptide), H-Ala-Ala-Asn-Gln-His-Leu--Ser-His-Leu-Val-Glu-Ala-Leu-Tyr-Leu-Va l--Glu--Gly-Phe-Phe-Tyr-Thr-Pro-Asn--Val-OH. The sturgeon insulin appears to be identical with one of two forms of paddlefish insulin and differs from the other form by a single substitution in the A-chain, Asp15: His15. The amino acid sequence of sturgeon insulin is more similar to the amino acid sequence of mammalian insulins than of other fish insulins. Sturgeon insulin showed parallel but weaker displacement than porcine insulin and pink salmon insulin in their respective radioimmunoassays and was less potent than porcine insulin in displacing radiolabeled porcine insulin bound to partially purified rat liver plasma membranes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2426267>Purification and amino-terminal sequence of an insulin-like growth factor-binding protein secreted by rat liver BRL-3A cells.</a></h1><p>A protein preparation that specifically binds insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) I and II was purified from medium conditioned by rat liver BRL-3A cells using molecular sieve chromatography in 1 M acetic acid followed by affinity chromatography on IGF-II-agarose. The affinity-purified IGF-binding protein exhibits a single major band with apparent Mr = 36,300 under reducing conditions on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The IGF-binding protein is efficiently and specifically cross-linked to either 125I-IGF-I (human) or 125I-IGF-II (rat) using disuccinimidyl suberate. An IGF-binding protein of similar apparent molecular weight was also affinity purified from rat hepatoma H-35 cell conditioned medium and found to differ from the BRL-3A protein such that potent polyclonal antisera prepared in rabbits against the purified BRL-3A IGF-binding protein exhibited a much lower titer for the H-35 protein in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and upon immunoblotting. In order to determine whether a single BRL-3A IGF-binding protein is present in the affinity-purified preparation, the protein was prepared for sequencing on a Sephacryl S-300 column in 6 M guanidine HCl after reduction and alkylation. The amino acid composition (expressed in percentages) of this IGF-binding protein was determined to be: Cys = 5.5,  = 4.8, His = 2.8,  = 7.8, Asx = 10.2, Thr = 5.1, Ser = 3.9, Glx = 15.7, Gly = 17.4, Ala = 7.3, Val = 4.6, Met = 1.4, Ile = 2.4, Leu = 8.3, Tyr = 1.0, Phe = 1.9. Sequencing of the NH2-terminal portion of this protein led to the identification of 31 amino acids in the following order: Phe--Cys-Pro-Pro-Cys-Thr-Pro-Glu--Leu-Ala-Ala--Pro-Pro-Pro- Asp-Ala-Pro-Cys-Ala-Glu-Leu-Val--Glu-Pro-Gly-Cys. We conclude that rat liver BRL-3A cells secrete a single major IGF-binding protein capable of binding both IGF-I and IGF-II.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8546696>Characterization of an insulin from the three-toed amphiuma (Amphibia: Urodela) with an N-terminally extended A-chain and high receptor-binding affinity.</a></h1><p>Insulin was isolated from an extract of the pancreas of a urodele, the three-toed amphiuma (Amphiuma tridactylum), and its primary structure established as Ala--Gly-Ile-Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys-His10-Asn-Thr-Cys- Ser-Leu-Asn-Gln-Leu-Glu-Asn20-Tyr-Cys-Asn for the A-chain and Ile-Thr-Asn-Gln-Tyr-Leu--Ser-His10-Leu-Val-Glu-Ala- Leu-Tyr-Leu-Val-Cys-Gly20-Asp--Gly-Phe-Phe-Tyr-Ser-Pro- for the B-chain. The N-terminus of the A-chain is extended by two amino acids (Ala-) relative to all other known insulins suggesting an anomalous pathway of post-translational processing in the region of the C-peptide/A-chain junction of proinsulin. In common with chicken and Xenopus insulins, which contain a HisA8, amphiuma insulin was more potent (approx. 5-fold) than porcine insulin in inhibiting the binding of [125I-TyrA14]insulin to the soluble human insulin receptor from transfected 293EBNA cells (an adenovirus-transformed human kidney cell line). This result is consistent with previous data showing that insulin analogues extended at GlyA1 by uncharged groups have reduced binding affinity whereas high affinity is preserved in analogues extended by basic amino acid residues.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3294835>Mass spectrometrically derived amino acid sequence of thioredoxin from Chlorobium, an evolutionarily prominent photosynthetic bacterium.</a></h1><p>The amino acid sequence of the thioredoxin isolated from the photosynthetic green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium thiosulfatophilum was determined chiefly by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry combined with Edman degradation and tandem mass spectrometry. For this purpose, the protein was digested with trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, thermolysin, and Staphylococcus aureus protease or combinations thereof. Chemical cleavage with cyanogen bromide was also used alone or in combination with trypsin. The resulting sequence of 108 amino acids is as follows: Ala-Gly- -Tyr-Phe-Glu-Ala-Thr-Asp--Asn-Phe-Gln- Thr-Glu-Xle-Xle-Asp-Ser-Asp--(Ala-Val)-Xle- Val-Asp-Phe-Trp-Ala-Ser-Trp--(Pro-Cys)- Met-Met-Xle-Gly-Pro-Val-Xle-Glu-Gln-Xle-Ala-Asp- Asp-Tyr-Glu-Gly--Ala-Xle-Xle-Ala--Xle-Asn- Val-Asp-Glu-Asn-Pro-Asn-Xle-Ala-Gly-Gln-Tyr-Gly- Xle--Ser-Xle-Pro-Thr-Met-Xle-Xle-Xle-Ly s- (Gly-Gly-)-Val-Val-Asp-Gln-Met-Val-Gly-Ala- Xle-Pro--Asn-Met-Xle-Ala---Xle-Asp-Glu-His-Il e-Gly (where Xle represents leucine or isoleucine; sequences in parentheses are based on homology considerations). It exhibits less than 53% homology with Escherichia coli thioredoxin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22504498>In vitro and in vivo studies on the antioxidant activity of fish peptide isolated from the croaker (Otolithes ruber) muscle protein hydrolysate.</a></h1><p>Peptide from croaker (Otolithes ruber) muscle protein hydrolysate was purified, characterized and evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activity. Results showed that purified peptide contained the amino acid sequence as -Thr-Phe---His (861.6Da), which were expected to contribute to its antioxidant activities. This peptide efficiently quenched 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl radicals (84.5±1.2 and 62.4±2.9%), and successfully inhibits the lipid peroxidation and DNA damage and proven to be a potent antioxidant at different in vitro systems. It also improved the endogenous cellular antioxidant enzymes in Wistar rat by increasing the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) after supplementation of the peptide (283.6±7.25, 4.3±0.78 and 28.42±1.97) compared to the negative control (196.4±5.65, 1.3±0.45 and 15.1±0.35). Therefore, croaker muscle peptide can increase an endurance capacity and facilitate recovery from oxidative stress.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Mutations were made in this region of the thioredoxin gene and the mutant proteins expressed in E. coli strains lacking thioredoxin. Mutant proteins with a 17-membered or 11-membered disulfide ring were inactive in vivo. However, purified thioredoxin with the active site sequence --Pro-Cys- is still able to serve as a substrate for thioredoxin reductase and a reducing agent in the ribonucleotide reductase reaction, although with greatly reduced catalytic efficiency. A smaller disulfide ring, with the active site sequence Cys-Ala-Cys, does not turn over at a sufficient rate to be an effective reducing agent. Strain in the small ring favors the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. Alteration of the invariant proline to a serine has little effect on redox activity. The function of this residue may be in maintaining the stability of the active site region rather than participation in redox activity or protein-protein interactions. Mutation of the positively charged lysine in the active site to a glutamate residue raises the Km values with interacting enzymes. Although it has been proposed that the positive residue at position 36 is conserved to maintain the thiolate anion on Cys-32 (Kallis & Holmgren, 1985), the presence of the negative charge at this position does not alter the pH dependence of activity or fluorescence behavior. The lysine is most likely conserved to facilitate thioredoxin-protein interactions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10525356>Purification and characterization of insulin from the Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri (Dipnoi).</a></h1><p>The Australian lungfish Neoceratodus forsteri, a facultative air breather, is considered to be the most primitive of the extant Dipnoi and so occupies a uniquely important evolutionary position in the transition from fish to tetrapods. Insulin was isolated from an extract of the pancreas of N. forsteri and its primary structure established as: A-Chain, Gly-Ile-Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys-His-Thr-Pro(10)-Cys-Ser-Leu-Tyr-Gln-Leu-G lu-Asn-Tyr-Cys(20)-Asn-Glu-Thr-Glu; B-Chain, Ala-Ala-Val-Asn-Gln-His-Leu--Ser(10)-His-Leu-Val-Glu-Ala-Leu- Tyr-Phe-Val-Cys(20)-Gly-Glu--Gly-Phe-Phe-Tyr-Leu-Pro- (30)-Gly. This amino acid sequence is more similar to that of human insulin than to insulins from present-day amphibians. All the residues in human insulin that are considered to be important in receptor binding, dimerization, and hexamerization are conserved in lungfish insulin except for the substitution (Leu --> Phe) at the position corresponding to B17 in human insulin. Consistent with the assertion that the Dipnoi is a monophyletic group, insulins from N. forsteri and from the African lungfish Protopterus annectens contain extensions to the C-terminus of the A-chain and to the N-terminus of the B-chain that have not been found in other sarcopterygian species. However, the unusual amino acid substitutions found in insulin from P. annectens (e.g., GlyB21 --> Ala, GluB22 --> Asp, and ArgB23 --> Asn) are not present in N. forsteri insulin, suggesting that they occurred in the Protopterus lineage after divergence of the genera.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3680247>Trigramin. A low molecular weight peptide inhibiting fibrinogen interaction with platelet receptors expressed on glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex.</a></h1><p>Trigramin, a highly specific inhibitor of fibrinogen binding to platelet receptors, was purified to homogeneity from Trimeresurus gramineus snake venom. Trigramin is a single chain (approximately 9 kDa) cysteine-rich peptide with the Glu-Ala-Gly-Glu-Asp-Cys-Asp--Ser-Pro-Ala NH2-terminal sequence. Chymotryptic fragmentation showed the -Gly-Asp sequence in trigramin. Trigramin inhibited fibrinogen-induced aggregation of platelets stimulated by ADP (IC50 = 1.3 X 10(-7)M) and aggregation of chymotrypsin-treated platelets. It did not affect the platelet secretion. Trigramin was a competitive inhibitor of the 125I-fibrinogen binding to ADP-stimulated platelets (Ki = 2 X 10(-8) M). 125I-Trigramin bound to resting platelets (Kd = 1.7 X 10(-7) M; n = 16,500), to ADP-stimulated platelets (Kd = 2.1 X 10(-8) M; n = 17,600), and to chymotrypsin-treated platelets (Kd = 8.8 X 10(-8) M; n = 13,800) in a saturable manner. The number of 125I-trigramin binding sites on thrombasthenic platelets amounted to 2.7-5.4% of control values obtained for normal platelets and correlated with the reduced number of GPIIb-GPIIIa molecules on the platelet surface. EDTA, monoclonal antibodies directed against the GPIIb-GPIIIa complex, and synthetic peptides (-Gly-Asp-Ser and Tyr-Gly-Gln-Gln-His-His-Leu-Gly-Gly-Ala--Gln-Ala-Gly-Asp-Val) blocked both 125I-fibrinogen binding and 125I-trigramin binding to platelets. Fibrinogen binding was more readily inhibited by these compounds than was trigramin binding. Monoclonal antibodies directed either against GPIIb or GPIIIa molecules did not block the interaction of either ligand with platelets. Reduced, S-pyridylethyl, trigramin did not inhibit platelet aggregation and fibrinogen binding to platelets and it did not bind to platelets, suggesting that the secondary structure of this molecule is critical for expression of its biological activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14977973>Relationship between structures and biological activities of mycoplasmal diacylated lipopeptides and their recognition by toll-like receptors 2 and 6.</a></h1><p>The lipopeptide FSL-1 [S-(2,3-bispalmitoyloxypropyl)--Asp-Pro--His-Pro--Ser-Phe, Pam(2)CGDPKHPKSF] synthesized on the basis of the N-terminal structure of a Mycoplasma salivarium lipoprotein capable of activating normal human gingival fibroblasts to induce the cell surface expression of ICAM-1 revealed an activity to induce production of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-8. FSL-1 also activated macrophages to produce tumor necrosis factor alpha as the Mycoplasma fermentans-derived lipopeptide MALP-2 (Pam(2)CGNNDESNISFKEK), a potent macrophage-activating lipopeptide, did. The level of the activity of FSL-1 was higher than that of MALP-2. This result suggests that the difference in the amino acid sequence of the peptide portion affects the activity because the framework structure other than the amino acid sequence of the former is the same as that of the latter. To determine minimal structural requirements for the activity of FSL-1, the diacylglyceryl Cys and the peptide portions were examined for this activity. Both portions did not reveal the activity. A single amino acid substitution from Phe to  and a fatty acid substitution from palmitic acid to stearic acid drastically reduced the activity. Similar results were obtained in measuring the NF-kappaB reporter activity of FSL-1 to human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with Toll-like receptor 2 and 6, together with a NF-kappaB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid. These results suggest that both the diacylglyceryl and the peptide portions of FSL-1 are indispensable for the expression of biological activities and for the recognition by Toll-like receptors 2 and 6 and that the recognition of FSL-1 by Toll-like receptors 2 and 6 appears to be hydrophobic.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11889136>Unconventional activation mechanisms of MMP-26, a human matrix metalloproteinase with a unique PHCGXXD cysteine-switch motif.</a></h1><p>ProMMP-26 has the unique Pro-His(81)--Xaa-Xaa-Asp cysteine-switch motif that discriminates this protease from all other matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) known so far. The conserved, free cysteine residue of the conventional PRCXXPD sequence interacts with the zinc ion of the catalytic domain and provides the fourth coordination site for the catalytic zinc, thereby preventing latent proMMPs from becoming active. MMPs become functionally active when proteolytic cleavage releases the prodomain and the PRCXXPD sequence and exposes the zinc atom. Here, we report that the Pro-His(81)--Xaa-Xaa-Asp motif is not functional in proMMP-26 and consequently is not involved in the activation mechanisms. Organomercurial treatment failed to activate proMMP-26. The autolytic --Gln(59) downward arrow Gln(60)-Phe-His cleavage upstream of the Pro-His(81)--Xaa-Xaa-Asp motif induced the proteolytic activity of recombinant proMMP-26 whereas any further cleavage inactivated the enzyme. The His(81) --> (81) mutation restored the conventional cysteine-switch sequence in the prodomain but failed to induce the cysteine-switch activation mechanism. These data and computer modeling studies allowed us to hypothesize that the presence of His(81) significantly modified the fold of proMMP-26, abolished the functionality of the cysteine-switch motif, and stimulated an alternative intramolecular activation pathway of the proenzyme.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9105886>Pharmacological characterization of protease-activated receptor (PAR-1) in rat astrocytes.</a></h1><p>The proteolytic action of thrombin on its receptor (protease-activated receptor-1 or PAR-1) results in a conformational change in which the new N-terminal sequence auto-activates the receptor. Peptide analogs of this N-terminal sequence (TRAPs) are able to mimic the effect of thrombin and an extensive search has led to the definition of the structural requirement for the agonist and antagonist activity on thrombin receptors in several peripheral systems. Thrombin plays an important role in central and peripheral nervous system development and PAR-1 is present in neurons and astrocytes. We have now characterized thrombin receptors pharmacologically in cultured rat astrocytes by using [3H]thymidine incorporation and reversal of stellation induced by Bt2cAMP as end-points. Thrombin increased [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA with an EC50 of 1 nM and induced a complete reversion of cell stellation. The effects of thrombin on [3H]thymidine incorporation were mimicked by TRAP-14 (EC50 = 3 microM) and a peptide containing non-natural amino acids Ala-Phe(p-F)--Cha-HArg-Tyr-NH2 (A6Y; EC50 = 0.8 microM). Similarly, these two peptides reversed Bt2cAMP-induced stellation. The effect of thrombin, TRAP-14 and A6Y on [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was significantly prevented by L9R, a 9-amino-acid peptide (Leu-Val--D---His-Ser-; IC50 = 180 microM against thrombin and TRAP-14 and 800 microM against A6Y) previously described as an antagonist in human platelet aggregation. L9R antagonized also thrombin effects on astrocyte morphology. These results demonstrate that rat astrocytes express PAR-1 receptors which are pharmacologically similar to those previously characterized in human platelets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1697592>Molecular cloning of cDNA encoding a 55-kDa multifunctional thyroid hormone binding protein of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum.</a></h1><p>A cDNA clone encoding 55-kDa multifunctional, thyroid hormone binding protein of rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum was isolated and sequenced. The cDNA encoded a protein of 509 amino acids, and a comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein indicates that an 18-residue NH2-terminal signal sequence was removed during synthesis. The deduced amino acid sequence of the rabbit muscle clone suggested that this protein is related to human liver thyroid hormone binding protein, rat liver protein disulfide isomerase, human hepatoma beta-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and hen oviduct glycosylation site binding protein. The protein contains two repeated sequences Trp--His-Cys- proposed to be in the active sites of protein disulfide isomerase. Northern blot analysis showed that the mRNA encoding rabbit skeletal muscle form of the protein is present in liver, kidney, brain, fast- and slow-twitch skeletal muscle, and in the myocardium. In all tissues the cDNA reacts with mRNA of 2.7 kilobases in length. The 55-kDa multifunctional thyroid hormone binding protein was identified in isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles using a monoclonal antibody specific to the 55-kDa thyroid hormone binding protein from rat liver endoplasmic reticulum. The mature protein of Mr 56,681 contains 95 acidic and 61 basic amino acids. The COOH-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein is highly enriched in acidic residues with 17 of the last 29 amino acids being negatively charged. Analysis of hydropathy of the mature protein suggests that there are no potential transmembrane segments. The COOH-terminal sequence of the protein, -Asp-Glu-Leu (RDEL), is similar to but different from that proposed to be an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal; -Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) (Munro, S., and Pelham, H.R.B. (1987) Cell 48, 899-907). This variant of the retention signal may function in a similar manner to the KDEL sequence, to localize the protein to the sarcoplasmic or endoplasmic reticulum.

Identification of a peptide sequence at the binding site for 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate.</a></h1><p>2'-O-[(R)-Formyl(adenin-9-yl)-methyl]-(S)-glyceraldehyde 3'-triphosphate (also designated as ATP dialdehyde or ATPDA) was utilized as an affinity label for the 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) binding site of an aryl sulfotransferase. The sulfotransferase employed in these studies was rat hepatic aryl sulfotransferase (AST) IV (also known as tyrosine-ester sulfotransferase, EC 2.8.2.9), for which a cDNA had been previously cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and the resulting enzyme purified to homogeneity. ATPDA was a time-dependent irreversible inhibitor of the recombinant AST IV, and this inhibition was prevented by including either PAPS or adenosine 3',5'-diphosphate (PAP) in the incubation of AST IV with ATPDA. Experiments relating covalent binding of [2,8-3H]ATPDA with catalytic activity indicated that 1 nmol of the affinity label was bound per nmol of AST IV subunit. Incubation of [2,8-3H]ATPDA with the enzyme followed by reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride, proteolysis with trypsin, and separation of the resulting peptides by high pressure liquid chromatography yielded two labeled peptide fractions. Automated sequence analysis showed that both modified peptide fractions were derived from the same sequence in AST IV: 63-Leu-Glu----68. Both the sequencing results and examination of the two peptide fractions by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry indicated that the ATPDA affinity label was bound to the hexapeptide at both lysine 65 and cysteine 66. These affinity labeled amino acids are located within a region of sequence in AST IV that shows considerable homology with various sulfotransferases that possess diverse specificities for acceptor substrates, and this may provide insight into PAPS binding in other sulfotransferases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9350978>Purification and characterization of islet hormones (insulin, glucagon, pancreatic, polypeptide and somatostatin) from the Burmese python, Python molurus.</a></h1><p>Insulin was purified from an extract of the pancreas of the Burmese python, Python molurus (Squamata:Serpentes) and its primary structure established as: A Chain: Gly-Ile-Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys-Glu-Asn-Thr10-Cys-Ser-Leu-Tyr-Glu-Leu- Glu-Asn-Tyr-Cys20-Asn. B-Chain: Ala-Pro-Asn-Gln-His-Leu--Ser-His10-Leu-Val-Glu-Ala-Leu-Tyr- Leu-Val-Cys-Gly20-Asp--Gly-Phe-Tyr-Tyr-Ser-Pro--Ser30. With the exception of the conservative substitution Phe --> Tyr at position B25, those residues in human insulin that comprise the receptor-binding and those residues involved in dimer and hexamer formation are fully conserved in python insulin. Python insulin was slightly more potent (1.8-fold) than human insulin in inhibiting the binding of [125I-Tyr-A14] insulin to the soluble full-length recombinant human insulin receptor but was slightly less potent (1.5-fold) than human insulin for inhibiting binding to the secreted extracellular domain of the receptor. The primary structure of python glucagon contains only one amino acid substitution (Ser28 --> Asn) compared with turtle/duck glucagon and python somatostatin is identical to that of mammalian somatostatin-14.

The hydropathic profile suggests that FA1 contains a transmembrane segment (Phe15-Val40) with only one basic (His31) and one acidic (Asp38) residue. The presence of the phosphate transport protein gene among nuclear genes is suggested from a lack of significant homology between the reverse-translated FA1 (mitochondrial codons) and the bovine mitochondrial genome. The inhibitory action of N-ethylmaleimide on the phosphate transport mechanism is discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2851318>A novel sodium channel inhibitor from Conus geographus: purification, structure, and pharmacological properties.</a></h1><p>A novel toxin, tentatively named conotoxin GS (CGS), has been isolated from a marine snail, Conus geographus. CGS was found to exist as a single polypeptide chain, consisting of 34 amino acid residues, cross-linked by three disulfide bonds. Its amino acid sequence was shown to be Ala-Cys-Ser-Gly--Gly-Ser--Cys-Hyp-Hyp-Gln-Cys-Cys-Met-Gly-Leu--  - -Gly-Asn-Pro-Gln--Cys-Ile-Gly-Ala-His-Gla-Asp-Val. In competition experiments, CGS inhibited the bindings of [3H]-tetrodotoxin ([3H]-TTX) and [3H]propionylconotoxin GIIIA to Electrophorus electricus electroplax membranes, with Ki values of 34 nM and 24 nM, respectively. The toxin inhibited the binding of [3H]-TTX (1 nM) to rat skeletal muscle homogenates with an IC50 value of 880 nM but showed very little effect on this binding to the rat brain P2 fraction at 10 microM. These binding studies indicate that CGS belongs to the same group of Na channel inhibitors as TTX, STX (saxitoxin), and mu-conotoxins. Although CGS, like the mu-conotoxins, is a pharmacological probe for distinguishing between neuronal and muscle Na channel subtypes, the homology in the sequences of CGS and mu-conotoxins is very limited.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11211158>Synthesis, analytical characterization, and osteoblast adhesion properties on RGD-grafted polypyrrole coatings on titanium substrates.</a></h1><p>The covalent attachment of an -Gly-Asp (RGD) containing peptide to polypyrrole(PPy)-coated titanium substrates has been investigated in order to develop a bioactive material of potential use in orthopedic fields. Polypyrrole has been employed as the coating polymer because of its suitability to be electrochemically grown directly onto metallic substrates of different shapes, leading to remarkably adherent films. The synthetic peptide -(-Gly-Asp)-Ser-Pro-, containing the cell-adhesive region of fibronectin (RGD), has been grafted to the polymer substrate via the cysteine residue using a procedure recently developed in the authors laboratory. The effectiveness of grafting was monitored by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which assessed the presence of the peptide grafted onto the polymer surface exploiting the cysteine sulfur as target element. Neonatal rat calvarial osteoblasts were attached to RGD-modified PPy-coated Ti substrates at levels significantly greater than on unmodified PPy-coated Ti and glass coverslip substrates.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2430804>Characterization of the thioredoxin system in the facultative phototroph Rhodobacter sphaeroides Y.</a></h1><p>This paper reports the purification and characterization of a thioredoxin system (thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, NADPH) from the facultative phototroph Rhodobacter sphaeroides Y. Rhodobacter sph. Y thioredoxin was purified to homogeneity with an assay based on the reduction of 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) by NADPH and Escherichia coli thioredoxin reductase. Rhodobacter sph. Y thioredoxin reductase was purified with the same assay using NADPH and E. coli thioredoxin. Rhodobacter sph. Y thioredoxin contained 102 amino acid residues and had a single intrachain disulfide bond. The two half-cystine residues are part of the active site made up of the sequence -Ala-Glu-Trp--Pro-Cys-- which is identical to that of E. coli thioredoxin except for the presence of an  instead of a . Rhodobacter sph. Y thioredoxin contains two tryptophan residues. The fluorescence intensity of the tryptophan residues is quenched in oxidized thioredoxin; on reduction, a much smaller increase is observed with Rhodobacter sph. Y thioredoxin than with the E. coli protein. However, the presence of 5 M guanidine X HCl results in the complete exposure of the two tryptophan residues. Rhodobacter sph. Y thioredoxin reductase has structural and functional similarities to E. coli thioredoxin reductase: it has a molecular mass of 68 kDa, and consists of two, probably identical, subunits. Each subunit has one bound FAD molecule. The enzyme is highly specific for NADPH; it is also highly specific for Rhodobacter sph. Y thioredoxin with a Km value of 3.3 +/- 0.6 microM. A kinetic study of the two thioredoxin systems shows that they have a high degree of cross-reactivity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12455825>Isolation, purification, and N-terminal partial sequence of an antitumor peptide from the venom of the Chinese scorpion Buthus martensii Karsch.</a></h1><p>An antitumor peptide (ANTP) was isolated and purified from the venom of the Chinese scorpion Buthus martensii Karsch. The purification procedure included gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 and Superdex 30 high resolution chromatography, Phenyl Sepharose 6 Fast Flow chromatography, and SP-Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography. Its homogeneity was demonstrated by size exclusion HPLC on TSK G2000 SW. The isoelectric point is more than 10 by pH 3-10 range isoelectric focusing. ANTP has a relative molecular mass of 6280, calculated from the measurement of 16.5% SDS-PAGE. The pharmacological tests showed that ANTP has antitumoral effects in the mouse S-180 fibrosarcoma model and Ehrlich ascites tumor model. Amino acid analysis suggested the ANTP is rich in glycine and does not have histidine and threonine. The sequence of the first 25 N-terminal residues is as follows: Val--Asp-Gly-Tyr-Ile-Ala-Asp-Asp--Asn-Cys-Ala-Tyr-Phe---Asn-Ala-Tyr-Cys-Asp-Asp-Glu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/911879>Purification and characterization of rabbit transcobalamin II.</a></h1><p>Rabbit transcobalamin II has been purified by labile ligand affinity chromatography and G-200 Sephadex gel filtration. Structural studies indicate Stokes' radii of 2.7 nm and 3.0 nm for transocobalamin II saturated and unsaturated with cobalamin. The amino acid content of the protein is very similar to that of human transcobalamin II (Allen, R. H. (1975) Prog. Hematol. 9, 59-84). The aminoterminal sequence for transcobalamin II is reported for the first time: Glu-Ile--Val-Pro--Val-Asp-Ser-Glu-Leu-Val-Glu--Leu-Gly-Gln--Leu-Leu-Pro-(Trp)-Met-Thr). The ultraviolet and circular dichroic spectra of aquo-, hydroxo-, azido- and cyanocobalamin bound to rabbit transcobalamin II are described. On complex formation the molar absorption of the cobalamins increases and the major bands shift to longer wavelengths. The spectra are little affected by change in the fifth ligand, which indicates that the electron density around the cobalt atom is kept fairly constant by the transcobalamin II molecule. This is in contrast to the observations for the same cobalamins attached to human intrinsic factor and human transcobalamin I (Nexo, E. and Olesen, H. (1976) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 446, 143-150).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2043663>Purification and characterization of an antiplatelet peptide, arietin, from Bitis arietans venom.</a></h1><p>By means of Fractogel TSK-50, CM-Sephadex C-50 column chromatography, gel filtrations on Sephadex G-75 and Sephacryl S-200 columns and reverse-phase HPLC, an antiplatelet peptide, arietin, was purified from venom of Bitis arietans. Arietin was shown to be an -Gly-Asp-containing peptide with a NH2-terminus, Ser-Pro-Pro-Val--Asn-- (Mr 8500). Arietin dose-dependently inhibited aggregation of human platelet suspension stimulated by ADP, thrombin, collagen and U46619 with IC50, 1.3-2.7.10(-7) M, while it had no effect on the initial shape changes and only slightly affected ATP release of platelets caused by thrombin and collagen. Arietin also blocked platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma and whole blood, and inhibited thrombin-induced clot retraction of platelet-rich plasma. Furthermore, arietin (6.5.10(-8) M) completely blocked the fibrinogen-induced aggregation of elastase-treated platelets, indicating that arietin interferes with the fibrinogen binding to fibrinogen receptors on platelet membranes. In conclusion, arietin, an -Gly-Asp-containing peptide, inhibits platelet aggregation probably through the blockade of fibrinogen binding to the activated platelets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3929689>Complete amino acid sequence of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase from Drosophila melanogaster.</a></h1><p>The complete amino acid sequence of the Drosophila melanogaster Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase subunit has been determined by automated Edman degradation. Sequence analyses were performed on the intact S-carboxymethylated protein, two fragments derived from CNBr cleavage, and three peptides recovered from mouse submaxillary protease digestion of the reduced and S-carboxymethylated enzyme. The peptides were aligned by characterizing peptides yielded by trypsin and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. All the peptides studied were purified exclusively by reverse-phase columns of HPLC and were analyzed with an improved liquid-phase sequencer. A molecular weight of 15,750 (subunit) was calculated from the 151 residues sequenced. The amino acid sequence of the Drosophila superoxide dismutase subunit is compared with that of four other eucaryotes: man, horse, cow, and yeast. Comparison of the five primary structures reveals very different rates of evolution at different times. Copper-zinc superoxide dismutase appears to be a very erratic evolutionary clock.

In this study, we firstly demonstrate the high expression of receptor for cyclic nine-amino acid peptide LyP-1 (-Asn---Thr--Gly-Cys) in both mouse and human pancreatic cancer. Based on these findings, sub-50 nm multifunctional superparamagnetic mesoporous nanospheres with surface modified with LyP-1 are rationally designed. Theses nanospheres have a core of silica-protected magnetite nanoparticle and a shell of FITC-labeled mesoporous silica, and they are able to specifically recognize and conjugate with the pancreatic cancer cell in vitro, as verified by the combined techniques of fluorescent imaging and T2 weight magnetic resonance imaging. After systematic administration, these LyP-1 immobilized nanospheres are found to actively target to mouse orthotopic xenograft of pancreatic cancer, which opens up the door for applications in early probing and diagnosis of pancreatic cancer by the multimodal imaging.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The predominant amino acids in the phospholipase A2 were cysteine, glycine, arginine, and lysine, suggesting that it is a basic one. The NH2-terminal 34 amino acids were found to be as follows: Asn-Leu-Val-Asn-Phe-His--Met-Ile--Leu-Thr-Thr-Gly--Glu-Ala-Ala-Leu- Ser-Tyr-Gly-Phe-Tyr-Gly-Cys-X--Val-Gly-Gly--Gly The enzyme contains Phe-5, Met-8, Ile-9, Tyr-24, Gly-25, Cys-26, Cys-28, Gly-29, Gly-31, Gly-32, and Gly-34 residues, all of which are conserved in most of the sequenced phospholipase A2. The remarkable feature of this enzyme was the absence of Cys-11, which is conserved in the "Group I" enzyme family. This is the first report concerning partial amino acid sequences of human non-pancreatic phospholipase A2.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3926769>The primary structure of thioredoxin from the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. 7119.</a></h1><p>Thioredoxin from the cyanobacterium Anabaena 7119 serves as electron donor to ribonucleotide reductase and as a protein disulfide reductase. This small, heat-stable protein was found to have structural and functional similarities to thioredoxins from both bacterial and mammalian sources. We here report the complete primary structure of Anabaena thioredoxin. The structure was determined by analysis of peptides obtained after cleavage with cyanogen bromide, Staphylococcus aureus protease, and trypsin. The protein consists of 106 residues with the following amino acid sequence: Ser-Ala-Ala-Ala-Gln-Val-Thr-Asp- Ser-Thr-Phe--Gln-Glu-Val-Leu-Asp-Ser-Asp-Val-Pro-Val-leu-Val-Asp-Phe- Trp-Ala-Pro-Trp--Pro-Cys--Met-Val-Ala-Pro-Val-Val-Asp-Glu- Ile-Ala-Gln-Gln-Tyr-Glu-Gly--Ile--Val-Val--Val-Asn-Thr-Asp- Glu-Asn-Pro-Gln-Val-Ala-Ser-Gln-Tyr-Gly-Ile--Ser-Ile-Pro-Thr-Leu- Met-Ile-Phe--Gly-Gly-Gln--Val-Asp-Met-Val-Val-Gly-Ala-Val-Pro- -Thr-Thr-Leu-Ser-Gln-Thr-Leu-Glu--His-Leu.

AWBP-PEG-PLL was synthesized by the reaction between the vinylsulfone group of PEG-g-PLL and the thiol group of cysteine in AWBP. 1H-NMR analysis confirmed the composition of the obtained polymer and indicated that four mol of AWBP were reacted to one mole of VS-PEG-PLL. The particles of AWBP-PEG-PLL/pDNA complexes were determined spherical with a size of approximately 100 nm by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Agarose gel retardation assay indicated that AWBP-PEG-PLL was able to condense plasmid DNA and reach complete complexation at and above a charge ratio 1/1 (+/-). Transfection efficiency of AWBP-PEG-PLL/pDNA complexes was 150-180 times higher than that of control systems, such as PEG-g-PLL/pDNA and PLL/pDNA, in both bovine aorta endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. Luciferase activities of AWBP-PEG-PLL depended on the amount of free AWBP, while those of the control carriers such as PLL and PEG-g-PLL were not affected by free AWBP. These results supported that gene transfer of AWBP-PEG-PLL/pDNA complexes to bovine aorta wall cells was mediated by specific artery wall cell receptor-mediated endocytosis.</p></html>
