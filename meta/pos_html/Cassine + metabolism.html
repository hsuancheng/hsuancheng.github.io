<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17064038>Application of the aza-Achmatowicz oxidative rearrangement for the stereoselective synthesis of the Cassia and Prosopis alkaloid family.</a></h2><p>cis-2-Methyl-6-substituted piperidin-3-ol alkaloids of the Cassia and Prosopis species are readily prepared by a combination of an aza-Achmatowicz oxidative rearrangement and dihydropyridone reduction followed by a stereoselective allylsilane addition to a N-sulfonyliminium ion. The stereochemical outcome of the reduction reaction can be attributed to steric hindrance between the pseudoaxially oriented 2,6-substituents and the equatorially approaching hydride reagent which explains the exclusive formation of the cis-alcohol by axial approach of the hydride. The unsaturation present in the (E)-methyl-pent-3-enoate side chain was removed by catalytic reduction, and the remaining ester group was converted to the corresponding Weinreb's amide. This key intermediate was utilized for the synthesis of azimic acid, deoxocassine, , and spicigerine. The facile preparation of (S)-N-tosylamidofuran 16 and its conversion to the chiral Achmatowicz oxidation product 18 provide a formal chiral synthesis of these alkaloids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27491706>In vitro evaluation of the schistosomicidal effect of the extracts, fractions and major 3-hydroxy-2,6-dialkyl-substituted piperidine alkaloids from the flowers of Senna spectabilis (Fabaceae).</a></h2><p>In this work, we present the in vitro schistosomicidal activity evaluation of the most active dichloromethane fraction (FDm) (ED50=83.5μg/mL) and of a mixture of the major alkaloids ((-)-/(-)-spectaline, C/E) (ED50=37.4μg/mL) from the flowers of Senna spectabilis against adult worms and cercariae. We also demonstrate other toxic effects including paralysis of the adult worms, inhibition of the secretory activity, tegument lesions and cercaricidal activity. In the association test of Praziquantel (PZQ)-C/E, we observed up to 80% mortality of Schistosoma mansoni in comparison to PZQ monotherapy. Due to the diversity of the toxic effects, the schistosomicidal activity of C/E is likely a result of a multitarget mechanism involving the tegument, secretory system and neuromotor action.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Their stereostructures have been elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic analysis, including 1D and 2D NMR techniques (COSY, ROESY, HSQC and HMBC), and spectrometric methods. The natural compounds and derivatives 13-15 have been tested for their potential as inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication. Five compounds from this series displayed potent antiviral activity with IC(50)s in the micromolar range (1, 3, 4, 7 and 8) being 1 and 8 the most active compounds. The target of these compounds was different from antiretroviral drugs currently licensed as they act as inhibitors of enhancer-dependent transcription. The structure-activity relationships were established based on the regiosubstitution and oxidation degree of the triterpene scaffold, revealing that these aspects were able to modulate the selectivity and intensity of HIV inhibition.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, the absence of chromophores makes their structural elucidation by conventional methods a great challenge. In this context, mass spectrometry emerges as a powerful tool for metabolomics studies.The piperidine alkaloids (-)- and (-)-spectaline and the semisynthetic derivatives (-)-3-O-acetylcassine and (-)-3-O-acetylspectaline were investigated by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) in the positive mode and electron ionization mass spectrometry (EI-MS). ESI fragmentation studies were performed with a quadrupole time-of-flight instrument; N was used as collision gas. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity of the investigated compounds was evaluated by bioautography and microplate screening assays.ESI-MS/MS and EI-MS provided valuable and complementary information about the structure of the piperidine compounds. Collision-induced dissociation experiments (MS/MS) revealed that neutral elimination of water or acetic acid is the major fragmentation pathway, which agrees with the stereochemistry proposed for (-)- and (-)-spectaline and the semisynthetic derivatives (-)-3-O-acetylcassine and (-)-3-O-acetylspectaline.The ESI-MS/MS and EI-MS studies allowed us to propose fragmentation mechanisms for piperidine alkaloids and derivatives. Therefore, mass spectrometry is an important tool for characterizing the structure of these compounds and for supporting further metabolomics studies.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26616281>Alkaloids derived from flowers of Senna spectabilis, (-)- and (-)-spectaline, have antiproliferative activity on HepG2 cells for inducing cell cycle arrest in G1/S transition through ERK inactivation and downregulation of cyclin D1 expression.</a></h2><p>Cancer is one of the most critical problems of public health in the world and one of the main challenges for medicine in this century. Unfortunately, most patients are diagnosed at advanced stage, when the treatment options are palliative. Consequently, the search for novel therapeutic options is imperative. In the context, the plants represent an important source for discovering of novel compounds with pharmacological potential including antineoplastic agents. Herein, we aimed to investigate in vitro antiproliferative and cytotoxic potentials of an alkaloid mixture derived from Senna spectabilis, (−)- (1) and (−)-spectaline (2). These alkaloids reduced cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner of six tumor cell lines. From initial screening, HepG2 cells were selected for further investigations. We show that alkaloids 1/2 have an important antiproliferative activity on HepG2 cells due to their ability in inducing cell cycle arrest in G1/S transition. This effect was associated to ERK inactivation and down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression. In addition, we evidenced a disruption of the microfilaments and microtubules in a consequence of the treatment. Taken together, the data showed by the first time that alkaloids 1/2 strongly inhibit cell proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Therefore, they represent promise antitumor compounds against liver cancer and should be considered for further anticancer in vivo studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17911003>Assessment of the content of phenolics and antioxidant actions of the Rubiaceae, Ebenaceae, Celastraceae, Erythroxylaceae and Sterculaceae families of Mauritian endemic plants.</a></h2><p>There is continued interest in the assessment of the bioefficacy of the active principles in extracts from a variety of traditional medicine and food plants in order to determine their impact on the management of a variety of clinical conditions and maintenance of health. The polyphenolic composition and antioxidant potential of Mauritian endemic plants of the Rubiaceae, Ebenaceae, Celastraceae, Erythroxylaceae and Sterculaceae family were determined. The phenolics level of the plant extracts varied from 1 to 75 mg/g FW, the maximum level measured in Diospyros neraudii (Ebenaceae). Coffea macrocarpa showed the highest flavonoids content with 18+/-0.7 mg/g FW. The antioxidant capacity based on the TEAC and FRAP values were strongly related to total phenolics and proanthocyanidins content, while a weaker correlation was observed with (-) gallic acid. Erythroxylum sideroxyloides showed the highest protective effect in the lipid peroxidation systems with IC(50) of 0.0435+/-0.001 mg FW/ml in the Fe(3+)/ascorbate system and 0.05+/-0.002 mg FW/ml in the AAPH system.  orientalis, E. sideroxyloides, Diospyros mellanida and Chassalia coriancea var. johnstonii were weakly prooxidant only at higher concentration greater of 10 g FW/L indicating potential safety. Mauritian endemic plants, particularly the genus Diospyros, are good sources of phenolic antioxidants and potential candidates for the development of prophylactic agents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20938943>Versatile one-pot reductive alkylation of lactams/amides via amide activation: application to the concise syntheses of bioactive alkaloids (±)-bgugaine, (±)-coniine, (+)-preussin, and (-)-.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042034>LC-MS Metabolomics and Chemotaxonomy of Caffeine-Containing Holly ( Ilex) Species and Related Taxa in the Aquifoliaceae.</a></h2><p>Ilex species have been consumed traditionally as medicinal teas worldwide. Though the presence of caffeine has been reported in several species, little is known about secondary-metabolite diversity within and among these taxa. Leaf samples of Ilex guayusa, Ilex paraguariensis, and Ilex vomitoria were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and comparative metabolite profiling with Ilex  and other Ilex species to identify chemotaxonomic markers, delimit species, and provide an assessment of chemodiversity. Purine alkaloids were detected and quantified in I. guayusa, I. paraguariensis, and I. vomitoria. Reports of caffeine for I.  were not corroborated, suggesting that I. vomitoria was the traditional source of the Native North American tea yaupon. The tetramethyluric acid, theacrine, was detected for the first time in the genus Ilex as a low-level chemotaxonomic marker in I. vomitoria samples. Chemotaxonomy and metabolomics support a close relationship for caffeine-containing Ilex species.</p></html>
