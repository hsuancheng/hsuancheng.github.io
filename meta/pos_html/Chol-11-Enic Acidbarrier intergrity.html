We hypothesized that unsaturated FA could alleviate saturated FA-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurring in intestinal secretory goblet cells, and consequently the reduced synthesis and secretion of mucins that form the protective mucus . To investigate this hypothesis, we treated well-differentiated human colonic LS174T goblet cells with palmitic  (PAL)-the most commonly used inducer of lipotoxicity in in vitro systems-or -9, -6, or -3 unsaturated fatty  alone or in co-treatment with PAL, and measured the impact of such treatments on ER stress and Muc2 production. Our results showed that only eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA)  protect goblet cells against ER stress-mediated altered Muc2 secretion induced by PAL, whereas neither linolenic  nor -9 and -6 FA are able to provide such protection. We conclude that EPA and DHA could represent potential therapeutic nutrients against the detrimental lipotoxicity of saturated fatty , associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity or inflammatory bowel disease. These in vitro data remain to be explored in vivo in a context of dietary obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29875659>Multi-Target Protective Effects of Gintonin in 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-Mediated Model of Parkinson's Disease via Lysophosphatidic  Receptors.</a></h1><p>Gintonin is a ginseng-derived lysophosphatidic  receptor (LPAR) ligand. Although previous  and  studies demonstrated the therapeutic role of gintonin against Alzheimer's disease, the neuroprotective effects of gintonin in Parkinson's disease (PD) are still unknown. We investigated whether gintonin (50 and 100 mg/kg/day, p.o., daily for 12 days) had neuroprotective activities against neurotoxicity in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD. Pre-administration of 100 mg/kg gintonin displayed significantly ameliorating effects in neurological disorders (motor and welfare) as measuring using pole, rotarod, and nest building tests, and in the survival rate. These effects were associated to the reduction of the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons, microglial activation, activation of inflammatory mediators (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor, and cyclooxygenase-2), and alteration of blood-brain  (BBB)  in the substantia nigra pars compacta and/or striatum following MPTP injection. The benefits of gintonin treatment against MPTP also included the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 pathways and the inhibition of phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways. Interestingly, these neuroprotective effects of gintonin were blocked by LPAR1/3 antagonist, Ki16425. Overall, the present study shows that gintonin attenuates MPTP-induced neurotoxicity via multiple targets. Gintonin combats neuronal death, and acts as an anti-inflammatory and an anti-oxidant agent. It maintains BBB . LPA receptors play a key role in gintonin-mediated anti-PD mechanisms. Finally, gintonin is a key agent for prevention and/or treatment of PD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30283130>Caloric restriction promotes functional changes involving short-chain fatty  biosynthesis in the rat gut microbiota.</a></h1><p>Caloric restriction (CR) is known to promote health and longevity, likely via modification of the gut microbiota (GM). However, functional and metabolic changes induced in the GM during CR are still unidentified. Here, we investigated the short- and long-term effects of CR on the rat GM using a metaproteogenomic approach. We show that a switch from ad libitum (AL) low fat diet to CR in young rats is able to induce rapid and deep changes in their GM metaproteomic profile, related to a reduction of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and an expansion of lactobacilli. Specifically, we observed a significant change in the expression of the microbial enzymes responsible for short-chain fatty  biosynthesis, with CR boosting propionogenesis and limiting butyrogenesis and acetogenesis. Furthermore, these CR-induced effects were maintained up to adulthood and started to be reversed after a short-term diet change. We also found that CR alters the abundance of an array of host proteins released in stool, mainly related to epithelial   and inflammation. Hence, our results provide thorough information about CR-induced modifications to GM and host functional activity, and might constitute the basis for novel GM-based approaches aimed at monitoring the effectiveness of dietary interventions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31010378>Doxorubicin-induced neurotoxicity is associated with acute alterations in synaptic plasticity, apoptosis, and lipid peroxidation.</a></h1><p>Cognitive deficits are commonly reported by patients following treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. Anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens are associated with cognitive impairment and reductions in neuronal connectivity in cancer survivors, and doxorubicin (Dox) is a commonly used anthracycline. Although it has been reported that Dox distribution to the central nervous system (CNS) is limited, considerable Dox concentrations are observed in the brain with co-administration of certain medications. Additionally, pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are overproduced in cancer or in response to chemotherapy, can reduce the  of the blood-brain  (BBB). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the acute neurotoxic effects of Dox on hippocampal neurons. In this study, we utilized a hippocampal cell line (H19-7/IGF-IR) along with rodent hippocampal slices to evaluate the acute neurotoxic effects of Dox. Hippocampal slices were used to measure long-term potentiation (LTP), and expression of proteins was determined by immunoblotting. Cellular assays for mitochondrial complex activity and lipid peroxidation were also utilized. We observed reduction in LTP in hippocampal slices with Dox. In addition, lipid peroxidation was increased as measured by thiobarbituric  reactive substances content indicating oxidative stress. Caspase-3 expression was increased indicating an increased propensity for cell death. Finally, the phosphorylation of signaling molecules which modulate LTP including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Akt were increased. This data indicates that acute Dox exposure dose-dependently impairs synaptic processes associated with hippocampal neurotransmission, induces apoptosis, and increases lipid peroxidation leading to neurotoxicity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31405019>Cooked Red Lentils Dose-Dependently Modulate the Colonic Microenvironment in Healthy C57Bl/6 Male Mice.</a></h1><p>Dietary pulses, including lentils, are protein-rich plant foods that are enriched in intestinal health-promoting bioactives, such as non-digestible carbohydrates and phenolic compounds. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of diets supplemented with cooked red lentils on the colonic microenvironment (microbiota composition and activity and epithelial   and function). C57Bl/6 male mice were fed one of five diets: a control basal diet (BD), a BD-supplemented diet with 5, 10 or 20% cooked red lentils (by weight), or a BD-supplemented diet with 0.7% pectin (equivalent soluble fiber level as found in the 20% lentil diet). Red lentil supplementation resulted in increased: (1) fecal microbiota α-diversity; (2) abundance of short-chain fatty  (SCFA)-producing bacteria (e.g.,  and ); (3) concentrations of fecal SCFAs; (4) mRNA expression of SCFA receptors (G-protein-coupled receptors () and tight/adherens junction proteins (Zona Occulden-1 (), Claudin-2, E-cadherin). Overall, 20% lentil had the greatest impact on colon health outcomes, which were in part explained by a change in the soluble and insoluble fiber profile of the diet. These results support recent public health recommendations to increase consumption of plant-based protein foods for improved health, in particular intestinal health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351968>Berberine induces ZIP14 expression and modulates zinc redistribution to protect intestinal mucosal  during polymicrobial sepsis.</a></h1><p>The present study investigated if berberine might induce Zrt-Irt-like protein 14 (ZIP14) and affect zinc redistribution to protect intestinal  in sepsis.Rodent model of sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Plasma endotoxin was assayed by LAL test and plasma zinc was measured by flame atomic spectrophotometer. Gut mucosal permeability was determined by plasma FITC-dextran. Zinc content and ZIP14 mRNA in gut mucosa were assayed by spectrophotometer and qRT-PCR, respectively. Tight junction  of Caco-2 was evaluated by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Tight junction (TJ) protein expression was detected by Western blotting.Berberine and zinc gluconate pretreatment to CLP rats improved survival rate, reduced plasma endotoxin level, alleviated hypozincemia, increased zinc accumulation and ZIP14 mRNA expression in the intestinal mucosa. Berberine and zinc gluconate pretreatment decreased CLP-elicited intestinal hyperpermeability to FITC-dextran. These effects of berberine in vivo were abolished by AG1024. In vitro, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) repressed zinc transfer into Caco-2 cells exposed to zinc gluconate. Berberine and IGF-I treatment increased ZIP14 protein expression and promoted zinc transfer into Caco-2 cells exposed to zinc gluconate plus LPS. Berberine treatment induced TJ protein (claudin-1 and occludin) and raised TEER in LPS-treated Caco-2 cells. These effects of berberine in vitro were partially inhibited by ZIP14 siRNA.The present study reveals that berberine induces ZIP14 expression and affects zinc re- distribution to protect intestinal  in sepsis, which is partially linked with the activation of IGF-I signaling.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Importantly, those skin care products should fulfil specific requirements for specific life phases and specific skin conditions. In this review, we focused on 2 different age groups - namely, infants and the elderly - as well as on 2 specific skin conditions occurring in both age groups - very dry skin (Xerosis) and hyperhydrated skin (diaper rash). The goal in both conditions should be to maintain skin surface in its physiological acidic state, which is in turn crucial for the permeability  function, stratum corneum /cohesion and antimicrobial defense. Skin care products formulated with an effective buffer system at a more acidic pH, for example 4, may be the best option to improve the  mantle and skin  function and thus keep the skin in "good condition."© 2018 S.

Surprisingly, astrocytes exert paradoxical roles during disease development, but the mechanisms remain unknown. Previously, we have reported that administering an interfering peptide (GluA2-G-Gpep) which specifically disrupts the GluA2-GAPDH interaction rescued neurological symptoms in the EAE mouse model of MS. In this study, we validated that the GluA2-GAPDH complex was elevated in LPS-induced primary reactive astrocytes, and GluA2-G-Gpep treatment significantly reduced GFAP expression levels in both EAE mice and reactive astrocytes. Further in vivo and in vitro analyses revealed that GluA2-G-Gpep administration normalized EAAT1 and EAAT2 expression, rescued compromised blood-brain   via AQP4, promoted actin reorganization and changed mitochondrial dynamics. These alterations may partially be explained by changes in the nuclear GAPDH and p53 transcription pathways. Our findings provide critical implications for understanding the astrocyte properties regulated by GluA2-GAPDH associated with MS, and insights for novel treatment options targeting at astrocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31126033>Health Benefits of Heat-Killed (Tyndallized) Probiotics: An Overview.</a></h1><p>Nowadays, the oral use of probiotics is widespread. However, the safety profile with the use of live probiotics is still a matter of debate. Main risks include: Cases of systemic infections due to translocation, particularly in vulnerable patients and pediatric populations; acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes; or interference with gut colonization in neonates. To avoid these risks, there is an increasing interest in non-viable microorganisms or microbial cell extracts to be used as probiotics, mainly heat-killed (including tyndallized) probiotic bacteria (lactic  bacteria and bifidobacteria). Heat-treated probiotic cells, cell-free supernatants, and purified key components are able to confer beneficial effects, mainly immunomodulatory effects, protection against enteropathogens, and maintenance of intestinal  . At the clinical level, products containing tyndallized probiotic strains have had a role in gastrointestinal diseases, including bloating and infantile coli-in combination with mucosal protectors-and diarrhea. Heat-inactivated probiotics could also have a role in the management of dermatological or respiratory allergic diseases. The reviewed data indicate that heat-killed bacteria or their fractions or purified components have key probiotic effects, with advantages versus live probiotics (mainly their safety profile), positioning them as interesting strategies for the management of common prevalent conditions in a wide variety of patients´ characteristics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31352050>Development of a novel human stratum corneum model, as a tool in the optimization of drug formulations.</a></h1><p>Transdermal delivery represents a very attractive administration route that provides various advantages over other methods of administration, including enhanced patient compliance via non-invasive, painless and simple application and reduced side effects. Thereby, the research on suitable drugs for this route continues to increase. However, most of drug candidates face the challenges of low drug permeability across the skin's biologically active  - the stratum corneum (SC). In this context, a low cost, simple screening tool to evaluate penetration of drug candidates in a human SC  model was developed. The in vitro model is based on a modified phospholipid vesicle-based permeation assay (PVPA) with a lipid composition close to human SC layer. The new SC PVPA model can be stored up to 2 weeks at -20 °C, withstand a pH range from 2.0 to 8.0 and the presence of co-solvents (DMSO, oleic  and cremophor®) without losing their . The human mimicking SC PVPA model was able to detect calcein permeability differences when different drugs, applied in the therapy of skin-related diseases, were present. The obtained data correlated well with the well accepted pig ear model, which highlights the potential of this new human SC model.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to hemostasis, Plts also function to stabilize the vasculature and maintain endothelial cell (EC)  . We hypothesized that Plt-EVs would inhibit vascular endothelial cell permeability, similar to fresh Plts. To investigate this hypothesis we utilized in vitro and in vivo models of vascular endothelial compromise and bleeding.In vitro: Plt-EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and characterized for Plt markers and particle size distribution. Effects of Plts and Plt-EVs on endothelial  function was assessed by trans - endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements and histological analysis of endothelial junction proteins. Hemostatic potential of Plt-EVs and Plts were assessed by multiple electrode Plt aggregometry. In vivo: The effects of Plts and Plt-EVs on vascular permeability and bleeding were assessed in NOD-SCID mice by an established Miles Assay of vascular permeability and a tail snip bleeding assay.In vitro: Plt-EVs displayed exosomal size distribution and expressed Plt specific surface markers. Plts and Plt-EVs decreased EC permeability and restored EC junctions after thrombin challenge. Multiplate aggregometry revealed that Plt-EVs enhanced Thrombin Receptor Activating Peptide (TRAP) mediated aggregation of whole blood, whereas Plts enhanced TRAP, Arachidonic  (ASPI), Collagen, and Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) mediated aggregation. In vivo: Plt-EVs are equivalent to Plts in attenuating VEGF-A induced vascular permeability and uncontrolled blood loss in a tail snip hemorrhage model.Our study is the first to report that Plt-EVs might provide a feasible product for transfusion in trauma patients to attenuate bleeding, inhibit vascular permeability and mitigate the endotheliopathy of trauma (EOT).Original Article LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: This is a pre-clinical study so it does not confirm to the level of evidence table for all clinical studies and case reports.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610731>Bone Marrow-Derived Cells Restore Functional  of the Gut Epithelial and Vascular Barriers in a Model of Diabetes and ACE2 Deficiency.</a></h1><p> There is incomplete knowledge of the impact of bone marrow (BM) cells on the gut microbiome and gut  function.  We postulated that diabetes and systemic angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) deficiency would synergize to adversely impact both the microbiome and gut  function.  Bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing and metatranscriptomic analysis were performed on fecal samples from WT, ACE2, Akita (type 1 diabetic, T1D), and ACE2-Akita mice. Gut   was assessed by immunofluorescence, and BM cell extravasation into the small intestine was evaluated by flow cytometry. In the CE2-Akita or Akita mice, the disrupted  was associated with reduced levels of myeloid angiogenic cells (MACs), but no increase in inflammatory monocytes was observed within the gut parenchyma. Genomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of the microbiome of ACE2-Akita mice demonstrated a marked increase in peptidoglycan (PGN) producing bacteria. When compared to control cohorts treated with saline, intraperitoneal administration of MACs significantly decreased the microbiome gene expression associated with PGN biosynthesis and restored epithelial and endothelial gut  . Also indicative of diabetic gut  dysfunction, increased levels of PGN and intestinal fatty  binding protein-2 (FABP-2) were observed in plasma of human subjects with T1D (n=21) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D, n=23) compared to non-diabetic controls (n=23). Using human retinal endothelial cells, we determined that PGN activates a non-canonical Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) associated MyD88-ARNO-ARF6 signaling cascade, resulting in destabilization of p120-catenin and internalization of VE-cadherin as a mechanism of deleterious impact of PGN on the endothelium.  We demonstrate for the first time that the defect in gut  function and dysbiosis in CE2-Akita mice can be favorably impacted by exogenous administration of MACs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31220438>Flavonoids from Citrus aurantium ameliorate TNBS-induced ulcerative colitis through protecting colonic mucus layer integrity.</a></h1><p>Intestinal  injury is recognized as the main reason for ulcerative colitis (UC) which is a chronic inflammatory disease and the effective therapeutic methods remain limited. In this study, we explored the protection effects of naringenin, nobiletin and hesperetin from Citrus aurantium on colonic mucus layer integrity. The UC mice model was induced by trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS). Forty mg/kg/day of naringenin, nobiletin and hesperetin were administrated orally for 7 and 3 days before and after TNBS treatment. Then body weight, disease activity index (DAI) score and colon length were recorded. Colons were collected for immunofluorescence, RT-PCR and western blot assay. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cell-co-culture system of Caco-2 and RAW264.7 cells were used to determine activities on protecting intestinal epithelial monolayers damage. Our results showed that Naringenin, nobiletin and hesperetin alleviated body weight loss and colon shortness, decreased DAI score, and up-regulated claudin-2, occludin and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression significantly. Meanwhile, the flavonoids enhanced trans epithelial electric resistance, decreased the permeability and up-regulated occludin and ZO-1 expression in LPS-damaged epithelial monolayers system. Hence, Naringnien, nobiletin and hesperetin show the regulatory effect on UC by protecting colonic mucosa layer integrity. It is suggested the flavonoids may be new supplements for the treatment of UC.Copyright © 2019.

The present study aimed to investigate whether  polysaccharide (DIP) could modulate the recovery of gut microbiota composition and intestinal  function after broad-spectrum antibiotic-driven dysbiosis. Alteration and restoration in the microbial communities were elucidated by the Illumina MiSeq platform. Colon histology, expression of tight-junction associated proteins, and serum/tissue endotoxin and cytokine levels were evaluated. Two-week daily oral administration of clindamycin and metronidazole resulted in reduced bacterial diversity and richness, and perturbed the microbial flora at various taxonomic levels (altered Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and increased relative abundance of harmful flora (Proteobacteria, and )), whereas DIP administration reversed the dysbiosis and increased beneficial flora, including Lactobacillaceae (lactic -producing bacteria), and Ruminococaceae (butyrate-producing bacteria). In addition, it resulted in the reduction of endotoxemia (through lipopolysaccharides (LPSs)) and pro-inflammatory cytokine (tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 1β (IL-1β)) levels, with the increased expression of tight-junction associated proteins (claudin-1, occludin, and zonula occludens-1).

It is well known that an adequate Sertoli cell function is essential to maintain germ cell development. The aim of the present study was to analyze whether G and R are able to affect Sertoli cell functions, such as energy metabolism and blood-testis  (BTB) . Sertoli cell cultures from 20-day-old rats were exposed to 10 and 100 ppm of G or R, doses which do not decrease cell viability. Neither G nor R caused impairment in lactate production or fatty  oxidation. G and R decreased Transepithelial Electrical Resistance, which indicates the establishment of a Sertoli cell junction . However, neither G nor R modified the expression of claudin11, ZO1 and occludin, proteins that constitute the BTB. Analysis of cellular distribution of claudin11 by immunofluorescence showed that G and R induced a delocalization of the signal from membrane to the cytoplasm. The results suggest that G and R could alter an important function of Sertoli cell such as BTB  and thus they could compromise the normal development of spermatogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The treatment of AD with bath additives remains highly debated. Recent evidence suggests that dilute apple cider vinegar (ACV) may improve skin   in AD, but its safety and efficacy are not well studied. This pilot split-arm study analyzed the effect of dilute apple cider vinegar soaks on skin   in patients with atopic dermatitis as measured by skin transepidermal water loss and skin pH.A total of 22 subjects (11 AD and 11 healthy controls) were enrolled. Subjects soaked both of their forearms for 14 days, with one arm in dilute ACV (0.5% acetic ) and the other in water 10 minutes daily. Transepidermal water loss and pH were measured pre- and post-treatment.In both groups, transepidermal water loss increased and pH decreased at 0 minutes post-ACV treatment, but these effects were not sustained at 60 minutes. In total, 72.7% (16/22) of subjects reported mild side effects from ACV with improvement after discontinuing the soaks.Dilute ACV soaks have no significant effect on skin   but caused skin irritation in a majority of subjects. Study limitations include analysis of a single brand, dilution, and application of ACV.

Fiber-rich common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) promote intestinal health (microbiota and host epithelial  integrity) in lean mice. The objective was to assess the intestinal health promoting effects of navy bean supplementation during high-fat (HF)diet-induced obesity. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a high-fat (HF) diet (60% of kcal from fat) or an isocaloric HF diet supplemented with 15.7% (by weight) cooked navy bean powder (HF+B) for 12 weeks. Compared to HF, the HF+B diet altered the fecal microbiota community structure (16S rRNA gene sequencing), most notably increasing abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila (+19-fold), whose abundance typically decreases in obese humans and rodents. Additionally, HF+B fecal abundance of carbohydrate fermenting, short chain fatty  (SCFA) producing Prevotella (+332-fold) and S24-7 (+1.6-fold) and fecal SCFA levels were increased. HF+B improved intestinal health and epithelial  integrity versus HF, evidenced by reduced serum fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran concentration in an in vivo gut permeability test, and increased intestinal mRNA expression of tight junction components (ZO-1, occludin), anti-microbial defenses (Reg3γ, IgA, Defα5, Defβ2) and mucins (Muc2). Additionally, HF+B improved the systemic obese phenotype via reduced serum HOMA-IR and leptin:adiponectin ratio, and locally via attenuation of epididymal adipose tissue crown-like structure formation, adipocyte size, and inflammatory transcription factor (NFκBp65 and STAT3) activation. Therefore, navy bean supplementation improved obese intestinal health (microbiota and epithelial  integrity) and attenuated the severity of the obese phenotype.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Using a piglet model, our previous study indicated that exogenous faecal microbiota can increase the expressions of tight junction proteins, mucin and antimicrobial peptide in the intestinal mucosa, suggesting a beneficial effect of FMT on gut  and gastrointestinal health. However, specific connections between FMT-induced microbial changes and modulation of the intestinal  remain to be fully illustrated. Here, we aimed to determine the potential role of metabolic function of gut microbiota in the beneficial effects of FMT.The influence of FMT on the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis was assessed by early-life gut microbiota intervention on newborn piglets and subsequent lipopolysaccharide [LPS] challenge. Analysis of the gut microbiome and metabolome was carried out by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and multiple mass spectrometry platforms.FMT modulated the diversity and composition of colonic microbiota and reduced the susceptibility to LPS-induced destruction of epithelial  and severe inflammatory response. Metabolomic analysis revealed functional changes of the gut metabolome along with a significant increase of the typical microbiota-derived tryptophan catabolite indole-3-acetic  in the colonic lumen. In concordance with the metabolome data, metagenomics prediction analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing also demonstrated that FMT modulated the metabolic functions of gut microbiota associated with indole alkaloid biosynthesis, cytochrome P450 and intestinal homeostasis, which coincided with up-regulation of cytokine interleukin-22 and enhanced activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the recipient colon.Our data reveal a regulatory effect of FMT on tryptophan metabolism of gut microbiota in the recipient colon, which may play a potential role in maintenance of the intestinal .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30397350>Human retinoic -regulated CD161 regulatory T cells support wound repair in intestinal mucosa.</a></h1><p>Repair of tissue damaged during inflammatory processes is key to the return of local homeostasis and restoration of epithelial . Here we describe CD161 regulatory T (T) cells as a distinct, highly suppressive population of T cells that mediate wound healing. These T cells were enriched in intestinal lamina propria, particularly in Crohn's disease. CD161 T cells had an all-trans retinoic  (ATRA)-regulated gene signature, and CD161 expression on T cells was induced by ATRA, which directly regulated the CD161 gene. CD161 was co-stimulatory, and ligation with the T cell antigen receptor induced cytokines that accelerated the wound healing of intestinal epithelial cells. We identified a transcription-factor network, including BACH2, RORγt, FOSL2, AP-1 and RUNX1, that controlled expression of the wound-healing program, and found a CD161 T cell signature in Crohn's disease mucosa associated with reduced inflammation. These findings identify CD161 T cells as a population involved in controlling the balance between inflammation and epithelial  healing in the gut.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30291906>Endothelins in inflammatory neurological diseases.</a></h1><p>Endothelins were discovered more than thirty years ago as potent vasoactive compounds. Beyond their well-documented cardiovascular properties, however, the contributions of the endothelin pathway have been demonstrated in several neuroinflammatory processes and the peptides have been reported as clinically relevant biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies report that endothelin-1 significantly contributes to the progression of neuroinflammatory processes, particularly during infections in the central nervous system (CNS), and is associated with a loss of endothelial  at the blood brain  level. Because of the paucity of clinical trials with endothelin-1 antagonists in several infectious and non-infectious neuroinflammatory diseases, it remains an open question whether the 21 amino  peptide is a mediator/modulator rather than a biomarker of the progression of neurodegeneration. This review focuses on the potential roles of endothelins in the pathology of neuroinflammatory processes, including infectious diseases of viral, bacterial or parasitic origin in which the synthesis of endothelins or its pharmacology have been investigated from the cell to the bedside in several cases, as well as in non-infectious inflammatory processes such as neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimers Disease or central nervous system vasculitis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The study objective was to investigate short-term and long-term effects of two emollients on symptoms and skin  functions in xerotic eczema. Randomized, double-blind, study enrolling females/males, with bilateral itching. Two emollients, containing lactic  and refined almond oil with/without polidocanol were administered on left versus right body sides. Itching severity, skin moisture, lipid content, and pH were assessed on Day 1, within 30-120 min after first administration, and on Days 7 and 14, and compared with baseline assessments. Severity of itching decreased 30 min after first administration of both emollients compared with baseline (p < .0001) and reached a maximum reduction of 63% (p < .0001) and 69% (p < .0001) on Day 14. Skin moisture and lipid content increased after first application, and further ameliorated within 14 days of treatment (p < .0001). Both emollients were tolerated well, and only a few adverse events were reported. This study confirmed the clinical efficacy of the two study emollients to substantially reduce itching already after first administration, and restore skin   and thus should be considered as therapeutic approach for xerotic eczema.© 2018 The Authors.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of benzoic  (A),  coagulans (B) and oregano oil (O) combined supplementation on growth performance and intestinal  in piglets challenged with enterotoxigenic  (ETEC). Thirty piglets were randomly assigned to 6 treatments: (1) nonchallenged control (CON); (2) ETEC-challenged control (ETEC); (3) antibiotics + ETEC (AT); (4) A + B + ETEC (AB); (5) A + O + ETEC (AO); (6) A + B + O + ETEC (ABO). On day 22, piglets were orally challenged with ETEC or saline. The trial lasted 26 days. Dietary AO and ABO inhibited the reduction of growth performance and the elevation of diarrhoea incidence in piglets induced by ETEC (<0.05). AB, AO, and ABO prevented the elevation of serum TNF- and LPS concentrations in piglets induced by ETEC (<0.05). ABO alleviated the elevation of TNF- and IL-1 concentrations and the reduction of sIgA level in jejunal mucosa induced by ETEC (<0.05). Furthermore, ABO upregulated mRNA expressions of Claudin-1 and Mucin2 (<0.05), downregulated mRNA abundances of TLR4 and NOD2 signaling pathways related genes in jejunal mucosa (<0.05), and improved the microbiota in jejunal and cecal digesta (<0.05) compared with ETEC group. These results indicated that benzoic ,  coagulans, and oregano oil combined supplementation could improve growth performance and alleviate diarrhoea of piglets challenged with ETEC via improving intestinal mucosal  , which was possibly associated with the improvement of intestinal microbiota and immune status. The combination of 3000 g/t benzoic  + 400 g/t  coagulans + 400 g/t oregano oil showed better effects than other treatments in improving growth performance and intestinal health of piglets, which could be used as a viable substitute for antibiotic.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576180>In vitro safety and performance evaluation of a seawater solution enriched with copper, hyaluronic , and eucalyptus for nasal lavage.</a></h1><p>The common cold is a viral infectious disease with symptoms such as runny nose, sore throat, and mainly, nasal congestion. State-of-the-art therapeutic approaches focus on alleviating the symptoms of this disease by non-invasive and simple-to-use methods. Nasal irrigation is one of the most accepted approaches to ease nasal congestion which, if left untreated, has a negative impact on the quality of life of patients.In this study, the safety and efficacy of a novel hypertonic seawater solution for nasal lavage enriched with hyaluronic , eucalyptus oil, copper, and manganese salts (Stérimar Stop & Protect Cold and Flu; SSPCF) have been investigated in vitro.An in vitro 3D reconstituted human nasal epithelium tissue model, MucilAir™, has been used in this study to investigate the safety of SSPCF on nasal epithelium by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion. The efficacy of SSPCF was measured by mucociliary clearance (MCC), ATP release, Alcian blue and aquaporin (AQP3) stainings.SSPCF treatment respected nasal epithelium tissue  and enhanced  function without inducing a cytotoxic response. Secreted LDH and IL-8 levels were similar to untreated controls. MCC rate was increased 2.5-fold and ATP release decreased 87% upon SSPCF treatment, indicating improved decongestion activity. SSPCF treatment after hypotonic stress helped recover cellular organization, as shown by Alcian blue and AQP3 staining assays.SSPCF appears as a safe and effective nasal irrigation formula that may alleviate the symptoms associated with common cold such as nasal congestion.© 2019 Huang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30636621>O-(2-[18F]-Fluoroethyl)-L-Tyrosine (FET) in Neurooncology: A Review of Experimental Results.</a></h1><p>In recent years, PET using radiolabelled amino  has gained considerable interest as an additional tool besides MRI to improve the diagnosis of cerebral gliomas and brain metastases. A very successful tracer in this field is O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) which in recent years has replaced short-lived tracers such as [11C]-methyl-L-methionine in many neuro-oncological centers in Western Europe. FET can be produced with high efficiency and distributed in a satellite concept like 2- [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. Many clinical studies have demonstrated that FET PET provides important diagnostic information regarding the delineation of cerebral gliomas for therapy planning, an improved differentiation of tumor recurrence from treatment-related changes and sensitive treatment monitoring. In parallel, a considerable number of experimental studies have investigated the uptake mechanisms of FET on the cellular level and the behavior of the tracer in various benign lesions in order to clarify the specificity of FET uptake for tumor tissue. Further studies have explored the effects of treatment related tissue alterations on tracer uptake such as surgery, radiation and drug therapy. Finally, the role of blood-brain   for FET uptake which presents an important aspect for PET tracers targeting neoplastic lesions in the brain has been investigated in several studies. Based on a literature research regarding experimental FET studies and corresponding clinical applications this article summarizes the knowledge on the uptake behavior of FET, which has been collected in more than 30 experimental studies during the last two decades and discusses the role of these results in the clinical context.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30795808>In-feed resin  reduce matrix metalloproteinase activity in the ileal mucosa of healthy broilers without inducing major effects on the gut microbiota.</a></h1><p>The chicken gut is constantly exposed to harmful molecules and microorganisms which endanger the  of the intestinal wall. Strengthening intestinal mucosal  is a key target for feed additives that aim to promote intestinal health in broilers. Recently, dietary inclusion of resin-based products has been shown to increase broiler performance. However, the mode of action is still largely unexplored. Coniferous resin  are known for their anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties, all properties that might support broiler intestinal health. In the current study, the effect of pure resin  on broiler intestinal health was explored. Ross 308 broilers were fed a diet supplemented with coniferous resin  for 22 days, after which the effect on both the intestinal microbiota as well as on the intestinal tissue morphology and activity of host collagenases was assessed. Dietary inclusion of resin  did not alter the morphology of the healthy intestine and only minor effects on the intestinal microbiota were observed. However, resin -supplementation reduced both duodenal inflammatory T cell infiltration and small intestinal matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity towards collagen type I and type IV. Reduced breakdown of collagen type I and IV might indicate a protective effect of resin  on intestinal   by preservation of the basal membrane and the extracellular matrix. Further studies are needed to explore the protective effects of resin  on broiler intestinal health under sub-optimal conditions and to elaborate our knowledge on the mechanisms behind the observed effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31454490>Astrocyte-derived fatty -binding protein 7 protects blood-brain   through a caveolin-1/MMP signaling pathway following traumatic brain injury.</a></h1><p>The astrocyte-endothelial cell interaction is crucial for normal brain homeostasis and blood-brain  (BBB) disruption in pathological conditions. However, the mechanism by which astrocytes control BBB , especially after traumatic brain injury (TBI), remains unclear. Here, we present evidence that astrocyte-derived fatty -binding protein 7 (FABP7), a differentiation- and migration-associated molecule, may function as a modulator of BBB permeability in a rat weight-drop model of TBI. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that TBI induced increased expression of FABP7 in astrocytes, accompanied by caveolin-1 (Cav-1) upregulation in endothelial cells. Administration of recombinant FABP7 significantly ameliorated TBI-induced neurological deficits, brain edema, and BBB permeability, concomitant with upregulation of endothelial Cav-1 and tight junction protein expression, while FABP7 knockdown resulted in the opposite effects. Furthermore, pretreatment with daidzein, a specific inhibitor of Cav-1, reversed the inhibitory effects of recombinant FABP7 on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9 expression and abolished its BBB protection after TBI. Altogether, these findings suggest that astrocyte-derived FABP7 upregulation may represent an endogenous protective response to BBB disruption partly mediated through a Cav-1/MMP signaling pathway following TBI.Copyright © 2019.

We conducted molecular dynamic simulation studies to evaluate the structural properties of the bilayer after lipid peroxidation and to measure the permeability of distinct ROS. The oxidized membrane contains free fatty , ceramide, cholesterol, and 5α-hydroperoxycholesterol (5α-CH). The result of unconstrained molecular dynamic simulations revealed that lipid peroxidation causes area-per-lipid of the bilayer to increase and bilayer thickness to decrease. The simulations also revealed that the oxidized group of 5α-CH (-OOH) moves towards the aqueous layer and its backbone tilts causing lateral expansion of the bilayer membrane. These changes are detrimental to structural and functional properties of the membrane. The measured free energy profile for different ROS (HO, HO, HO, and O) across the peroxidized lipid bilayer showed that the increase in lipid peroxidation resulted in breaching  decrease for all species, allowing easy traversal of the membrane. Thus, lipid peroxidation perturbs the membrane  and imposes oxidative stress resulting into apoptosis. The collective insights increase the understanding of oxidation stress at the atomic level.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30240794>Role of Oleanolic  in maintaining BBB  by targeting p38MAPK/VEGF/Src signaling pathway in rat model of subarachnoid hemorrhage.</a></h1><p>Vasogenic brain edema after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is an independent risk factor for death and poor prognosis. Disruption of the blood-brain  (BBB) is the main cause of vasogenic brain edema induced by SAH. Oleanolic  (OA) is a natural pentacyclic triterpenoid with various biological functions. Previous studies have shown that prophylactic administration of OA could prevent the BBB disruption in autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice. In this context, we speculate that OA may play a neuroprotective role by protecting the  of the BBB and reducing vasogenic cerebral edema after SAH. To validate this hypothesis, a SAH model was established on Sprague Dawley rats using a standard intravascular puncture model. The effects of OA on various physiological indexes were observed, including SAH grades, mortality, neurological function score, brain edema and BBB permeability. Related proteins of the brain endothelial cell junction complex were also detected, including tight junctions (TJs) and adherent junctions (AJs). Results showed that OA significantly reduced the permeability of BBB and relieved brain edema by increasing protein expression of TJs and AJs, and decreased the SAH grades by increasing the protein expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in SAH rats. Additionally, we found OA could inhibit up-regulation of VEGF and the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and suppress p38MAPK/VEGF/Src signaling pathway which involved in BBB disruption following SAH. From the experimental results, we speculate that OA effectively alleviated SAH-induced vasogenic edema by targeting p38 MAPK/VEGF/Src axis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The mechanisms via which the gut microbiota provide colonization resistance (CR) have not been fully elucidated, but they include secretion of antimicrobial products, nutrient competition, support of gut  integrity, and bacteriophage deployment. However, bacterial enteric infections are an important cause of disease globally, indicating that microbiota-mediated CR can be disturbed and become ineffective. Changes in microbiota composition, and potential subsequent disruption of CR, can be caused by various drugs, such as antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, antidiabetics, and antipsychotics, thereby providing opportunities for exogenous pathogens to colonize the gut and ultimately cause infection. In addition, the most prevalent bacterial enteropathogens, including ,  serovar Typhimurium, enterohemorrhagic , , , , , and , can employ a wide array of mechanisms to overcome colonization resistance. This review aims to summarize current knowledge on how the gut microbiota can mediate colonization resistance against bacterial enteric infection and on how bacterial enteropathogens can overcome this resistance.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29897225>Establishment of a Human iPSC- and Nanofiber-Based Microphysiological Blood-Brain  System.</a></h1><p>The blood-brain  (BBB) is an active and complex diffusion  that separates the circulating blood from the brain and extracellular fluid, regulates nutrient transportation, and provides protection against various toxic compounds and pathogens. Creating an in vitro microphysiological BBB system, particularly with relevant human cell types, will significantly facilitate the research of neuropharmaceutical drug delivery, screening, and transport, as well as improve our understanding of pathologies that are due to BBB damage. Currently, most of the in vitro BBB models are generated by culturing rodent astrocytes and endothelial cells, using commercially available transwell membranes. Those membranes are made of plastic biopolymers that are nonbiodegradable, porous, and stiff. In addition, distinct from rodent astrocytes, human astrocytes possess unique cell complexity and physiology, which are among the few characteristics that differentiate human brains from rodent brains. In this study, we established a novel human BBB microphysiologocal system, consisting of a three-dimensionally printed holder with a electrospun poly(lactic- co-glycolic)  (PLGA) nanofibrous mesh, a bilayer coculture of human astrocytes, and endothelial cells, derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), on the electrospun PLGA mesh. This human BBB model achieved significant   with tight junction protein expression, an effective permeability to sodium fluorescein, and higher transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) comparing to electrospun mesh-based counterparts. Moreover, the coculture of hiPSC-derived astrocytes and endothielial cells promoted the tight junction protein expression and the TEER value. We further verified the  functions of our BBB model with antibrain tumor drugs (paclitaxel and bortezomib) and a neurotoxic peptide (amyloid β 1-42). The human microphysiological system generated in this study will potentially provide a new, powerful tool for research on human BBB physiology and pathology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30362723>Penetration of PFASs Across the Blood Cerebrospinal Fluid  and Its Determinants in Humans.</a></h1><p>Laboratory studies indicate that exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) can induce neurobehavioral effects in animals. However, the penetration of PFASs across the brain  and its determining factors are yet to be clarified in humans. We studied PFAS levels in 223 matched-pair serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from hospital in-patients using UPLC/MS/MS. Among the 21 target analytes, PFOA, PFOS, and 6:2 Cl-PFESA were dominant in serum, with mean concentrations of 7.4, 6.8, and 6.2 ng/mL, respectively, contributing 79% to the total PFAS burden in serum. In CSF, PFOA, PFOS, and 6:2 Cl-PFESA were again the dominant PFASs, with mean concentrations of 0.078, 0.028, and 0.051 ng/mL contributing 36%, 13%, and 24%, respectively, to the total PFAS burden in CSF. Furthermore, PFAS penetration ( R, PFAS/PFAS) was positively correlated with the  permeability index R (Albumin/Albumin), indicating that   was the main determinant of PFAS penetration across the blood-CSF . Positive associations between the R values of the main PFASs and serum C-reactive protein were observed, implying that inflammation facilitates the penetration of PFASs across the brain .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154909>Unravelled facets of milk derived opioid peptides: a focus on gut , fractures and obesity.</a></h1><p>Beyond being a source of key nutrients, bovine milk influences physiological functions by synthesising bioactive peptides during the process of digestion. Some of the claimed negative health outcomes associated with milk consumption, such as cardiovascular diseases and type 1 diabetes may be attributed to an opioid peptide, beta-casomorphin-7 (BCM-7), derived from A1 beta-casein. BCM-7 exerts its  by binding to the μ-opioid receptors in the body. It is hypothesised that activation of the μ-opioid receptors in the gut can alter gut microbial composition, impair gut  integrity and bile  metabolism, in addition to increasing gastrointestinal transit time and gut inflammation. Further, it is hypothesised that BCM-7 may influence fractures and obesity via μ-opioid receptor pathways. In conclusion, it appears that BCM-7 might have multiple functions pertinent to human health; however, the evidence is limited and warrants further pre-clinical and clinical studies for hypothesis confirmation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307669>Changes in the intestinal mucosal proteome of turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) infected with haemorrhagic enteritis virus.</a></h1><p>Haemorrhagic enteritis (HE) is a viral disease affecting intestinal  and  function in turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and resulting in a significant economic loss. Sequential Windowed Acquisition of All Theoretical Fragment Ion Mass Spectra (SWATH-MS) was applied to identify crucial proteins involved in HE infection. A total of 938 proteins were identified and used to generate a reference library for SWATH-MS analysis. In total, 523 proteins were reliably quantified, and 64 proteins were found to be differentially expressed, including 49 up-regulated and 15 down-regulated proteins between healthy and HE-affected intestinal mucosa. Functional analysis suggested that these proteins were involved in the following categories of cellular pathways and metabolisms: 1) energy pathways; 2) intestine lipid and amino  metabolism; 3) oxidative stress; 4) intestinal immune response. Major findings of this study demonstrated that natural HE infection is related to the changes in abundance of several proteins involved in cell-intrinsic immune defense against viral invasion, systemic inflammation, modulation of excessive inflammation, B and T cell development and function and antigen presentation. mRNA quantitative expression demonstrated that most of the proteins involved in innate immunity that were found to be differentially abundant were produced by intestinal mucosa, suggesting its direct involvement in immune defences against HE infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study compared the toxicological effects of pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2), yessotoxin (YTX), okadaic  (OA), azaspiracid-1 (AZA1), 13-desmethyl-spirolide C (SPX), and palytoxin (PlTX) on the rat EGC cell line CRL2690. Cell viability, morphology, oxidative stress, inflammation, cell cycle, and specific glial markers were evaluated using RT-qPCR and high content analysis (HCA) approaches. PTX2, YTX, OA, AZA1, and PlTX induced neurite alterations, oxidative stress, cell cycle disturbance, and increase of specific EGC markers. An inflammatory response for YTX, OA, and AZA1 was suggested by the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Caspase-3-dependent apoptosis and induction of DNA double strand breaks (γH2AX) were also observed with PTX2, YTX, OA, and AZA1.

Dysbiosis may cause disruption of the intestinal , which contributes to immune activation by translocation of microbial antigens and metabolites. Intestinal fatty  binding protein (I-FABP) serves as a biomarker of enterocyte damage. The aim of this study was to investigate clinical and metabolic factors affecting plasma concentration of I-FABP in patients with psoriasis. Eighty patients with psoriasis and 40 control subjects were enrolled in the study. Serum I-FABP (243.00 (108.88-787.10) vs. 114.38 (51.60-241.60) pg/ml,  < 0.001) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR; 2.59 (1.96-3.09) vs. 1.72 (1.36-47 2.11),  < 0.01) were significantly increased in patients with psoriasis compared to controls. A significant positive correlation was found between I-FABP and body mass index (BMI) ( = 0.82,  < 0.001), Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) ( = 0.78,  < 0.001) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) ( = 0.24,  < 0.001). Rising quartiles of I-FABP were associated with increasing values of BMI, PASI and NLR. The results of the logistic regression model confirmed an increased risk of higher disease severity with I-FABP concentration - odds ratio 3.34 per 100 pg/mL I-FABP increase. In conclusion, intestinal  in patients with psoriasis is affected by obesity, severity of the disease and systemic inflammation.

Thus, poly(NVCL-co-IA-co-EGDMA) was embedded into chitosan and a new solid dispersion was prepared via spray-drying and ketoprofen was used as carrier. Two different sizes of hydrogel nanoparticles (120.6 nm and 185.9 nm) were evaluated and they exhibited a drug encapsulation efficiency of the 39.6% and 57.8%, respectively. The smaller nanoparticles showed to be faster for releasing of ketoprofen at pH 7.4 and 37 °C due to their larger surface area and higher swelling ability. Chitosan played a role of a secondary  for the ketoprofen diffusion, extending its release compared to hydrogel nanoparticles alone. Among two concentrations (40 wt% and 70 wt%) of hydrogel nanoparticles related to chitosan, the first one induced higher percentages of ketoprofen release: 74.2% against 64.6%. In addition, the interactions between chitosan matrix and poly(NVCL-co-IA-co-EGDMA) did not change the multi-responsive behavior of hydrogels, suggesting the chitosan was efficient for keeping  of nanoparticles hydrogels. Chitosan/poly(NVCL-co-IA-co-EGDMA) hybrid microparticles seems to be a promising new carrier for release of hydrophobic drugs, such as ketoprofen.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, previous mTLE-NHP models have some defects.Thirteen rhesus monkeys were randomly assigned to a control group and epilepsy group. Kainic  (KA) was injected into the left hippocampus and amygdala assisted by a neurosurgical robot system, while the control group received normal saline injection. Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) electrodes were implanted into the hippocampus in the acute and chronic stages to monitor epileptic discharges, with continuous behavior monitoring. The changes in hippocampal volume were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging. Transmission electron microscopy, western blotting and immunofluorescence were performed 3 months after injection to investigate neuronal ultrastructural alteration, blood-brain  (BBB) disruption, neuronal loss and gliosis in multiple brain regions.In the epilepsy group, status epilepticus (SE) and spontaneously recurrent seizures (SRSs) were detected in the acute and chronic stages via video monitoring. SEEG confirmed that the epileptic zone was focused on the injection area. The hippocampal volume was significantly decreased in the chronic stage compared with baseline. Neuronal ultrastructure and BBB  deteriorated in the hippocampus and amygdala of epileptic monkeys. The obvious neuronal loss and gliosis in the CA1-CA4 hippocampal regions were confirmed by western blotting and immunofluorescence; however, the temporal cortex was not affected. Moreover, the neuronal ultrastructural deterioration was detected in other limbic system regions (orbitofrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex).A novel mTLE-NHP model was induced by one-time intra-hippocampal and intra-amygdalar KA injection, with detectable SE and SRS. Severe hippocampal atrophy, neuronal ultrastructural damage, BBB disruption, neuronal loss and gliosis were confirmed in this model, with widespread limbic system damage, which are similar to the pathology of mTLE patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Patients with diabetes mellitus often have other cerebrovascular disease risk factors including hypertension, dyslipidemia, arrhythmia, and atherosclerosis obliterans. However, whether the drugs for these comorbidities are effective for improving HG-induced BBB damage is unclear.We investigated the effect of pitavastatin, candesartan, cilostazol, propranolol, and eicosapentaenoic  on HG-induced BBB damage. In vitro BBB models consisting of primary cultures of rat brain capillary endothelial cells were subjected to HG (55 mM d-glucose).We observed a significant decrease in transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) with HG, showing that HG compromised the  of the in vitro BBB model. No significant decrease in cell viability was seen with HG, but HG increased the production of reactive oxygen species. Pitavastatin and candesartan inhibited decreases in TEER induced by HG.In summary, pitavastatin and candesartan improved HG-induced BBB damage and this in vitro model of HG-induced BBB dysfunction contributes to the search for BBB protective drugs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to determine the effect of dietary FO on the intestinal microenvironment, including the microbial community and epithelial , in a mouse model of high-fat diet induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed (12 weeks) either a high-fat diet (HF, 60% fat as kcal) or an isocaloric HF supplemented with Menhaden FO (5.3% kcal, HF + FO). 16S rRNA sequencing was used to determine changes in fecal microbiota. Intestinal (ileum and colon) and epididymal adipose tissue RNA was used to assess biomarkers of   and inflammatory status, respectively. Serum was used to assess adipokine concentrations and insulin resistance. HF + FO diet altered the fecal microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Firmicutes and increasing the abundance of members of the Bacteroidetes phyla, as well as increasing the abundance of antiobesogenic Akkermansia muciniphila, compared to HF. Intestinal epithelial  functions were improved by HF + FO evidenced by increased mRNA expression of tight junction components, antimicrobial defenses and mucus  components. HF + FO-fed mice exhibited improvements in homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, oral glucose tolerance and serum adipokine concentrations and epididymal mRNA expression (increased adiponectin and decreased leptin) versus HF. HF + FO improved obese intestinal health and attenuated metabolic dysfunction associated with obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Dietary habits are one of the main causative factors for metabolic syndrome, CVD and type 2 diabetes. The human gut microbiota is emerging as an important player in the interaction between diet and metabolic health. Gut microbial communities contribute to human metabolism through fermentation of dietary fibre and the result of intestinal saccharolytic fermentation is production of SCFA. Acetate, propionate and butyrate positively influence satiety, endocrine system, glucose homeostasis, adipogenesis, lipid oxidation, thermoregulation, hepatic gluconeogenesis, endothelial function and gut  , and these mechanisms have all been linked to protection from type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular health. The gut microbiota is also involved in bile  metabolism and regulating their cell signalling potential, which has also been shown to modify pathways involved in metabolic health. Similarly, the gut microbiota renders recalcitrant plant polyphenols into biologically active small phenolic compounds which then act systemically to reduce metabolic disease risk. This review summarises how dietary patterns, specific foods and a healthy lifestyle may modulate metabolic health through the gut microbiota and their molecular cross-talk with the host.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652176>Effect of caseinate glycation with oligochitosan and transglutaminase on the intestinal  function of the tryptic caseinate digest in IEC-6 cells.</a></h1><p>Oligochitosan was used in this study to glycate commercial caseinate under the catalytic action of transglutaminase (TGase), followed by trypsin-mediated digestion. The prepared tryptic digests from both caseinate and oligochitosan-glycated caseinate were assessed and compared for their effects on the intestinal  function of a cell model (IEC-6 cells). Both digests had similar chemical features in the nine amino  (except for Met) and free amino group contents, but had different glucosamine contents. Both digests at 12.5-100 μg mL-1 promoted IEC-6 cell growth by 105.6-135.1% and more importantly improved intestinal epithelial   via increasing trans-epithelial electrical resistance, decreasing paracellular permeability from 100% to 64.1-85.4%, reducing bacterial translocation, and enhancing antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. The obtained qPCR and western-blot assay results also demonstrated that both digests had promoting effects on the expression levels of several tight junction proteins such as ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1. The oligochitosan-glycated caseinate digest always showed higher effects than the caseinate digest in the cells to retain the intestinal epithelial  function. This study thus highlights that the used TGase-type glycation endowed the oligochitosan-glycated caseinate with a potential functional food ingredient to strengthen the epithelial  function, which might be a helpful event to intestinal health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31159179>Towards a Food Pharmacy: Immunologic Modulation through Diet.</a></h1><p>Patients frequently wonder whether their dietary pattern influences the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Many patients even avoid certain foods that aggravate their symptoms. Although interest in nutritional interventions is rising among physicians, the current application of nutritional interventions in the IBD population is limited due to the lack of scientific evidence from clinical trials. Several studies, however, have identified associations between diet, gut microbiota, intestinal epithelial integrity, and mucosal immune responses. In patients consuming predominantly a Western diet high in n-6 poly-unsaturated fatty  (PUFAs), sugars, and meat, and low in fruits and vegetables, an impaired gut epithelial  and disturbances in the intestinal microbiota have been observed, resulting in a chronic mucosal inflammation. An anti-inflammatory diet may restore this disbalance.

Cd accumulates in the kidney, liver and in the nervous tissues, especially the brain. The neurotoxicity of Cd is very high, as it alters the , and increases the permeability, of the blood-brain . Cd penetrates and accumulates in neurons in the brains of rats. This study reveals that Cd decreases antioxidant enzymes and increases oxidative stress in the brain. In addition, Cd increases lipid peroxidation of brain tissues. Cd increases the expression of the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene. It also affects cholinergic, glutamatergic, gamma-Aminobutyric  (GABAergic), dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine neurotransmitters in brain tissue. Consequently, Cd increases the formation of amyloid β, a neurotoxic index, and induces apoptosis by changing the quality and the quantity of Bcl-2, Bax and p53 proteins. In conclusion, both selenium and nanoselenium show potential antioxidant activity and promote recovery from the neurotoxic action of Cd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30496629>Dietary ursolic  improves health span and life span in male Drosophila melanogaster.</a></h1><p>The health and life span of Drosophila melanogaster are partly determined by intestinal  , metabolic rate as well as stress response and the expression of longevity-associated genes, depending on genetic and dietary factors. Ursolic  (UA) is a naturally occurring triterpenoid exhibiting potential antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antiobesity activity and counteracting age-related deficits in muscle strength. In this study, UA was dietarily administered to w D. melanogaster which significantly elongated the health and life span of males. Spargel (srl) is the Drosophila orthologue of mammalian peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 α(PGC1α), an important regulator of energy homeostasis and mitochondrial function. Our results indicate that the health-promoting effect of UA, demonstrated by a significant increase in climbing activity, occurs via an upregulation of srl expression leading to a metabolic shift in the fly without reducing fecundity or gut . Moreover, UA affected the flies' microbiota in a manner that contributed to life span extension. Srl expression and microbiota both seem to be affected by UA, as we determined by using srl-mutant and axenic flies.© 2018 BioFactors, 45(2):169-186, 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847348>Nutritional Intervention for the Intestinal Development and Health of Weaned Pigs.</a></h1><p>Weaning imposes simultaneous stress, resulting in reduced feed intake, and growth rate, and increased morbidity and mortality of weaned pigs. Weaning impairs the intestinal , disturbs digestive and absorptive capacity, and increases the intestinal oxidative stress, and susceptibility of diseases in piglets. The improvement of intestinal development and health is critically important for enhancing nutrient digestibility capacity and disease resistance of weaned pigs, therefore, increasing their survival rate at this most vulnerable stage, and overall productive performance during later stages. A healthy gut may include but not limited several important features: a healthy proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells, an integrated gut  function, a preferable or balanced gut microbiota, and a well-developed intestinal mucosa immunity. Burgeoning evidence suggested nutritional intervention are one of promising measures to enhance intestinal health of weaned pigs, although the exact protective mechanisms may vary and are still not completely understood. Previous research indicated that functional amino , such as arginine, cysteine, glutamine, or glutamate, may enhance intestinal mucosa immunity (i.e., increased sIgA secretion), reduce oxidative damage, stimulate proliferation of enterocytes, and enhance gut  function (i.e., enhanced expression of tight junction protein) of weaned pigs. A number of feed additives are marketed to assist in boosting intestinal immunity and regulating gut microbiota, therefore, reducing the negative impacts of weaning, and other environmental challenges on piglets. The promising results have been demonstrated in antimicrobial peptides, clays, direct-fed microbials, micro-minerals, milk components, oligosaccharides, organic , phytochemicals, and many other feed additives. This review summarizes our current understanding of nutritional intervention on intestinal health and development of weaned pigs and the importance of mechanistic studies focusing on this research area.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29986311>Chlorogenic  improves intestinal  functions by suppressing mucosa inflammation and improving antioxidant capacity in weaned pigs.</a></h1><p>Intestinal  plays key roles in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Inflammation and oxidative damage can severely destroy the intestinal  of mammals. Chlorogenic  (CGA) is a natural polyphenol present in human diet and plants, possessing potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. This study was conducted to investigate the protective effects of CGA and its molecular mechanisms on intestinal  function in a porcine model. Twenty-four weaned pigs were allotted to two groups and fed with a basal diet or a basal diet containing 1000 mg/kg CGA. The results showed that CGA decreased serum D-lactate and diamine oxidase levels, and enhanced the expression and localization of claudin-1 protein in apical intercellular region of small intestinal epithelium. Interestingly, CGA significantly decreased the mucosa histamine and tryptase contents, as well as the tryptase-positive mast cell counts. Moreover, the expression levels of critical inflammation molecules (interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and nuclear factor-κB) were down-regulated by CGA in jejunal and ileal mucosa. However, the expression levels of inflammation repressors (suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 and toll-interacting protein) were up-regulated by CGA. Importantly, CGA decreased the malondialdehyde content but elevated glutathione peroxidase and catalase content in duodenal and jejunal mucosa. The expression levels of critical molecules in antioxidant signaling (nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 and heme oxygenase-1) were elevated by CGA in duodenal and jejunal mucosa. These results suggested that CGA could ameliorate intestinal  disruption in weaned pigs, which might be mediated by suppressing the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and activating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Various amino  have been shown to improve the intestinal tract, but the effect of tryptophan on the intestinal  has been controversial. Here, an in vitro Caco-2 cell model was built to investigate the protective and reparative effects of different concentrations of dietary l-Tryptophan (l-Trp) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intestinal tight junction injury. Lower concentrations (40 μM) of dietary l-Trp protected and repaired the  and permeability injury of the intestinal tight junction induced by LPS, while high concentrations (80 μM) may not have a positive effect. LPS-induced injury led to increased (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of Nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) and Myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), and decreased (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Mitogen-activated protein (MAP), and the treatment of dietary l-Trp alleviated those regulations in different concentrations, which suggests that dietary l-Trp may attenuate LPS-induced injury to tight junctions via inhibiting the NFκB-MLCK signaling pathway and activating the ERK1/2-MAP signaling pathway. And the mRNA and protein expressions of claudin-1, occludin and ZO-1 in LPS-induced injury were all down-regulated to varying degrees, and dietary l-Trp weakened the down-regulation of claudin-1 (P < 0.05) with no significant regulation of the protein expression of occludin and ZO-1 (P > 0.05).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30076847>Immunomodulatory tetracyclines ameliorate DNBS-colitis: Impact on microRNA expression and microbiota composition.</a></h1><p>The use of immunomodulatory antibiotics to simultaneously target different factors involved in intestinal inflammatory conditions is an interesting but understudied pharmacological strategy. A great therapeutic potential has been obtained with minocycline and doxycycline in experimental colitis. Therefore, understanding the contribution of the different activities of immunomodulatory tetracyclines is crucial for the improvement and translation of their use into clinic.A comparative pharmacological study including tetracyclines and other antibiotic or immunomodulatory drugs was performed in 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic  (DNBS)-induced colitis in mice. The correlation between the therapeutic efficacy of each drug and changes in the gut microbiota composition, markers of  , inflammatory mediators, microRNAs and TLRs was analysed to identify the main mechanisms of action.Tetracyclines counteracted most of the markers found altered in DNBS-colitis, which differed from effects of corticosteroid treatment. Of note, administration of tetracyclines led to increased mucosal protection, associated with up-regulated expression of CCL2, miR-142 and miR-375. All drugs with antibiotic activity ameliorated the progression of inflammation and reduced neutrophil-related genes, such as miR-223, despite their effects were not associated with restored intestinal dysbiosis. However, reduced bacterial richness was correlated with increased expression of TLR2 and TLR9 in antibiotic-treated groups and TLR6 was also up-regulated by the immunomodulatory tetracyclines with higher efficacy (doxycycline, minocycline and tigecycline).The anti-inflammatory effect of tetracyclines involves specific modifications in TLR and microRNA expression leading to an improved microbial-derived signalling and mucosal protection. These results support the potential of immunomodulatory tetracyclines to prevent inflammation-associated tissue damage in acute intestinal inflammation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

(1-3)-β-D-Glucan (BDG) is a fungal cell wall component which serves as a biomarker for gut   failure and microbial and fungal translocation. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether higher plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of BDG and suPAR were associated with NCI in PLWH. Paired blood and CSF samples were collected cross-sectionally from 61 male adult PLWH on ART (95% virally suppressed) who underwent a detailed NC assessment as part of the prospective CHARTER study between 2005 and 2015. BDG and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) were measured in frozen blood and CSF samples while soluble CD14 (sCD14), intestinal fatty  binding protein (IFABP), and CD4/CD8 ratio were measured in blood only. Spearman's rho correlation analysis assessed associations between BDG, other biomarkers, and NC performance. Median BDG levels were 18 pg/mL in plasma (range 2-60 pg/mL) and 20 pg/mL in CSF (range 0-830 pg/mL). Higher levels of plasma BDG were associated with worse NC performance (Spearman's rho = - 0.32; p = 0.013) and with the presence of NCI (p = 0.027). A plasma BDG cutoff of > 30 pg/mL was 30% sensitive and 100% specific for NCI. After adjusting for age, higher plasma suPAR levels were also associated with worse NC performance (p < 0.01). No significant associations were observed between the remaining biomarkers and the NC variables. Plasma levels of BDG and age-adjusted suPAR may be new biomarkers for the detection of NCI in PLWH on suppressive ART.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30577574>Dietary l-Tryptophan Supplementation Enhances the Intestinal Mucosal  Function in Weaned Piglets: Implication of Tryptophan-Metabolizing Microbiota.</a></h1><p>l-Tryptophan (Trp) is known to play an important role in the health of the large intestine. However, a role of dietary Trp in the small-intestinal mucosal  and microbiota remains poorly understood. The present study was conducted with weaned piglets to address this issue. Postweaning piglets were fed for 4 weeks a corn- and soybean meal-based diet supplemented with 0 (Control), 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4% Trp. The small-intestinal microbiota and serum amino  were analyzed by bacterial 16S rRNA gene-based high-throughput sequencing methods and high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively. The mRNA levels for genes involved in host defense and the abundances of tight-junction proteins in jejunum and duodenum were measured by real time-PCR and Western blot techniques, respectively. The concentrations of Trp in the serum of Trp-supplemented piglets increased in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with the control group, dietary supplementation with 0.2⁻0.4% Trp reduced the abundances of  and  in the jejunum, increased the abundances of  and  (two species of bacteria that can metabolize Trp) in the jejunum, and augmented the concentrations of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) as well as mRNA levels for porcine β-defensins 2 and 3 in jejunal tissues. Moreover, dietary Trp supplementation activated the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and increased the abundances of tight-junction proteins (zonula occludens (ZO)-1, ZO-3, and claudin-1) in jejunum and duodenum.

In this review, we aimed to discuss the morphological changes in each vessel following aging, and to evaluate the possible role of HS in the cerebrovascular alteration, such as arterial stiffness, microvessel loss, and blood-brain  disruption, with advancing age. Additionally, the review outlines the therapeutic efficacy of the HS-releasing compounds on the cerebrovasculature. In the central nervous system, cerebrovascular aging can lead to the loss of blood-brain , which causes cognitive impairment.

This study aims to investigate the effect of the amination degree of gelatin on the carbodiimide-mediated grafting of thermo-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) segments onto biodegradable protein backbone molecules. Moreover, the potential applications of these carrier materials for intracameral pilocarpine administration in glaucomatous subjects will be considered. The gelatins with different amination degrees that are prepared by controlling the feed amount of adipic  dihydrazide are further used for the synthesis of graft copolymers. The results of chemical characterization and electron microscopy studies showed that both grafting reaction effectiveness and gelling carrier ultrastructure vary in response to biomaterial amination. Compared to unmodified biopolymer thermogel without gel formation, graft copolymers that are composed of aminated gelatin networks showed a more remarkable temperature-triggered pilocarpine capture under physiological conditions. This could create more stable depot-forming carrier systems with improved in vivo pharmacological efficacy. Although the increase in amination degree enhances the biodegradation resistance of graft copolymers for achieving extended drug release profiles and provides significant therapeutic benefits, carriers with excess positive charges may potentiate the cytotoxic actions of oxidative stress signals and may cause damage in cellular  . Consequently, unfavorable ocular tissue responses and poor treatment outcomes are observed in glaucomatous rabbits. For the first time, our findings suggest that the amination degree of gelatin performs a crucial function in guiding the development of structure-property-function relationships of biodegradable thermogels as intracameral drug delivery systems.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Previously we have shown that endothelial activation induced by inflammation and hyperglycemia results in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated intercellular junction alterations accompanied by visual deficits in a tie2-TNF-α transgenic mouse model. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that increased ER stress via O-GlcNAcylation of VE-Cadherin likely contribute to endothelial permeability. We show that ER stress leads to GRP78 translocation to the plasma membrane, increased O-GlcNAcylation of proteins, particularly VE-Cadherin resulting in a defective complex partnering leading to the loss of retinal endothelial   and increased transendothelial migration of monocytes. We further show an association of GRP78 with the VE-Cadherin under these conditions. Interestingly, cells exposed to ER stress inhibitor, tauroursodeoxycholic  partially mitigated all these effects.

Sequencing of the 16S rDNA of gut bacteria, metagenomics, intestinal epithelial transcriptomics, and metabonomics were conducted. Results showed that the dietary interventions altered the microbiota composition of cecal digesta, microbiota-mediated metabolism, and the gene expression profile in intestinal epithelial cells. Compared with red meat-diet-fed mice, fiber-diet-fed mice presented a shift in the gut microbiome toward increased production of butanoate, which was accompanied by up-regulation of microbiota- and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent gene expression and decrease in serum concentrations of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), triglyceride (TG) and glucose (GLU).

Recent studies demonstrate that some probiotic and commensal bacteria secrete metabolites that are capable of affecting the intestinal functions. The present study examined an enhancing effect of bioactive factors secreted by Bifidobacterium breve strain B-3 on the intestinal tight junction (TJ)   in human intestinal Caco-2 cells. Administration of conditioned medium obtained from B. breve strain B-3 (B3CM) to Caco-2 cells for 24 h increased trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TER), a TJ  indicator, across their monolayers. Immunoblot, immunofluorescence, and qPCR analyses demonstrated that B3CM increased an integral TJ protein, claudin-4 expression. In luciferase reporter assay, the administration of B3CM enhanced the claudin-4 promoter activity, indicating the transcriptional upregulation of claudin-4. Site-directed mutation of specificity protein 1 (Sp1) binding sites in the claudin-4 promoter sequence and suppression of Sp1 expression by siRNA technology clearly reduced the enhancing effect of B3CM on claudin-4 promoter activity. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry detected a significant amount of acetic  in B3CM (28.3 mM). The administration of acetic  to Caco-2 cells partially mimicked a B3CM-mediated increase in TER, but failed to increase claudin-4 expression. Taken together, bioactive factors secreted by B. breve B-3 enhanced the TJ   in intestinal Caco-2 cells. Transcriptional regulation of claudin-4 through Sp1 is at least in part one of the underlying molecular mechanisms. In addition, acetic  contributes to the B3CM-mediated  effect independently of claudin-4 expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30078706>Dual Roles of Poly(dA:dT) Tracts in Replication Initiation and Fork Collapse.</a></h1><p>Replication origins, fragile sites, and rDNA have been implicated as sources of chromosomal instability. However, the defining genomic features of replication origins and fragile sites are among the least understood elements of eukaryote genomes. Here, we map sites of replication initiation and breakage in primary cells at high resolution. We find that replication initiates between transcribed genes within nucleosome-depleted structures established by long asymmetrical poly(dA:dT) tracts flanking the initiation site. Paradoxically, long (>20 bp) (dA:dT) tracts are also preferential sites of polar replication fork stalling and collapse within early-replicating fragile sites (ERFSs) and late-replicating common fragile sites (CFSs) and at the rDNA replication fork . Poly(dA:dT) sequences are fragile because long single-strand poly(dA) stretches at the replication fork are unprotected by the replication protein A (RPA). We propose that the evolutionary expansion of poly(dA:dT) tracts in eukaryotic genomes promotes replication initiation, but at the cost of chromosome fragility.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954486>Uric  treatment after stroke modulates the Krüppel-like factor 2-VEGF-A axis to protect brain endothelial cell functions: Impact of hypertension.</a></h1><p>Uric  (UA) is a promising protective treatment in ischaemic stroke, but the precise molecular targets underlying its in vivo beneficial actions remain unclear. High concentrations of UA inhibit angiogenesis of cultured endothelial cells via Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF)-induced downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a pro-angiogenic mediator that is able to increase blood-brain  (BBB) permeability in acute stroke. Here, we investigated whether UA treatment after ischaemic stroke protects brain endothelial cell functions and modulates the KLF2-VEGF-A axis. Transient intraluminal middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion/reperfusion was induced in adult male spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats and corresponding normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Animals received UA (16 mg/kg) or vehicle (Locke's buffer) i.v. at reperfusion. BBB permeability was evaluated by Evans blue extravasation to the brain and in human cerebral endothelial hCMEC/D3 cells under oxygen-glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation. Circulating VEGF-A levels were measured in rats and acute ischaemic stroke patients from the URICO-ICTUS trial. Angiogenesis progression was assessed in Matrigel-cultured MCA. Worse post-stroke brain damage in SHR than WKY rats was associated with higher hyperaemia at reperfusion, increased Evans blue extravasation, exacerbated MCA angiogenic sprouting, and higher VEGF-A levels. UA treatment reduced infarct volume and Evans blue leakage in both rat strains, improved endothelial cell   and KLF2 expression, and lowered VEGF-A levels in SHR rats. Hypertensive stroke patients treated with UA showed lower levels of VEGF-A than patients receiving vehicle. Consistently, UA prevented the enhanced MCA angiogenesis in SHR rats by a mechanism involving KLF2 activation. We conclude that UA treatment after ischaemic stroke upregulates KLF2, reduces VEGF-A signalling, and attenuates brain endothelial cell dysfunctions leading to neuroprotection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of iloprost and nitroglycerin on intestinal mitochondrial function and on mucosal  function . Mitochondrial oxygen consumption (respirometry) was determined in colon homogenates from 16 healthy rats before (baseline) and 15 min after incubation with nitroglycerin (25 and 250 μg/ml) and iloprost (0.1 and 1 μg/ml). State 2 (substrate-dependent oxygen consumption) and state 3 respiration (ADP-dependent oxygen consumption) were assessed and ADP/O ratio (ADP added/oxygen consumed) for complex I and II were calculated. For permeability measurement we used the Caco-2 monolayer. Fluorescein sulfonic  (FS) (200 μg/ml) and the drugs were administered into the apical compartment of the transwell chamber. After 48 h, FS translocation was assessed as basolateral/apical FS. Both concentrations of nitroglycerin and iloprost reduced state 3 by stimulation via both complexes. Iloprost increased ADP/O ratio after stimulation via both complexes at both concentrations. Nitroglycerin increased ADP/O ratio at the higher concentration (250 μg/ml) after stimulation via complex I and at the lower concentration (25 μg/ml) via complex II. Neither nitroglycerin nor iloprost influenced FS translocation.

Milk polar lipids, lipids derived from the milk fat globule membrane, could positively affect the aforementioned obesity-related endpoints. This study aimed to test the hypotheses that milk polar lipids will reduce gut permeability, systemic inflammation, and liver lipid levels, and differentially affect the hepatic expression of genes associated with fatty  synthesis and cholesterol regulation in preexisting obesity. We fed 3 groups of C57BL/6J ob/ob mice (n = 6 per group) for 2 wk: (1) a modified AIN-93G diet (CO) with 34% fat by energy; (2) CO with milk gangliosides (GG) at 0.2 g/kg of diet; and (3) CO with milk phospholipids (PL) at 10 g/kg of diet. The GG and PL were provided as semi-purified concentrates and replaced 2.0% and 7.2% of dietary fat by energy. The GG and PL did not affect total food intake, weight gain, fasting glucose, or gut permeability. The PL decreased liver mass and the mesenteric fat depot compared with the CO. The GG increased tight junction protein occludin in colon mucosa compared with the CO. The GG and PL decreased tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 in jejunum mucosa compared with the CO. Plasma endotoxin increased during the study but was unaffected by the treatments. Compared with the CO and GG, the PL increased plasma sphingomyelin and plasma IL-6. The GG and PL differentially regulated genes associated with lipid metabolism in the liver compared with the CO. Regarding general effects on lipid metabolism, the GG and PL decreased lipid levels in the liver and the mesenteric depot, and increased lipid levels in the plasma. Diet consumption decreased significantly when the ob/ob mice were kept in metabolic cages, which were not big enough and resulted in unwanted animal deaths. Future studies may keep this in mind and use better metabolic equipment for ob/ob mice. In conclusion, dietary milk polar lipids may have limited beneficial effects on gut  , systemic inflammation, and lipid metabolism in the context of severe obesity.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) form a physiochemical  that separates the intestinal lumen from the host's internal milieu and is strongly involved in the mucosal inflammatory response and immune response. Recent research indicates the involvement of the stimulator of interferons genes (STING) pathway in uncontrolled inflammation and gut mucosal immune response.We investigated the role of STING signaling in sepsis and intestinal  function using intestinal biopsies from human patients with abdominal sepsis and with an established model of abdominal sepsis in mice.In human abdominal sepsis, STING expression was elevated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and intestinal biopsies compared with healthy controls, and the degree of STING expression in the human intestinal lamina propria correlated with the intestinal inflammation in septic patients. Moreover, elevated STING expression was associated with high levels of serum intestinal fatty  binding protein that served as a marker of enterocyte damage. In mice, the intestinal STING signaling pathway was markedly activated following the induction of sepsis induced by cecal ligation perforation (CLP). STING knockout mice showed an alleviated inflammatory response, attenuated gut permeability, and decreased bacterial translocation. Whereas mice treated with a STING agonist (DMXAA) following CLP developed greater intestinal apoptosis and a more severe systemic inflammatory response. We demonstrated that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was released during sepsis, inducing the intestinal inflammatory response through activating the STING pathway. We finally investigated DNase I administration at 5 hours post CLP surgery, showing that it reduced systemic mtDNA and inflammatory cytokines levels, organ damage, and bacterial translocation, suggesting that inhibition of mtDNA-STING signaling pathway protects against CLP-induced intestinal  dysfunction.Our results indicate that the STING signaling pathway can contribute to lethal sepsis by promoting IEC apoptosis and through disrupting the intestinal . Our findings suggest that regulation of the mtDNA-STING pathway may be a promising therapeutic strategy to promote mucosal healing and protect the intestinal  in septic patients.

The present study aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of CA against hypoxic cerebral edema. Male mice were randomly divided into one normoxia group and three hypoxia groups, which were gavaged with sterilized water, CA, or dexamethasone, respectively, once daily for 4 days. The mice were then exposed to normoxia or hypoxia (9.5% O) for 24 h. The results showed that the brain water content (BWC) and blood-brain- permeability were significantly lower in the CA treatment group than in the hypoxia vehicle group. Mice in the CA treatment group showed good blood-brain- ; increased Na-K-ATPase activity and mitochondrial membrane potential; decreased oxidative stress and inflammation; and increased occludin protein levels. Prophylactic administration of CA and dexamethasone exerted similar effects against hypoxic cerebral edema.

Outcomes showed that both EA preconditioning and regular intervention could relieve CI by reducing toxicity of excitatory amino  (glutamate, aspartate) and TLR4/NF-κB-mediated inflammatory cascade reaction to relieve inflammatory injury. Moreover, EA preconditioning also could suppress the expression of pro-apoptosis genes and proteins to relieve apoptosis, regulate activation of microglia, and down-regulate the expression of blood brain  integrity-related matrix metalloprotein 9. Regular EA intervention also could promote angiogenesis to increase supply of blood and oxygen, facilitate regeneration, proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells via triggering activation of Notch and Shh signaling pathways, and promote the secretion of neurotrophin by up-regulating the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor /Trk A receptor, and promote expression of axon growth and synaptic remodeling-related factor (Ephrin B2/Eph B2) and sr-GTPase activating protein 1 and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42, axon growth and orientated down-stream molecules). However, up to now, the conclusion is still fragmentary and one-sided, and can not explain the specific mechanism of electroacupuncture in MCAO rats, needing further in-depth study.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30556045>Regulatory T Cells Restrict Permeability to Bacterial Antigen Translocation and Preserve Short-Chain Fatty  in Experimental Cirrhosis.</a></h1><p>Intestinal permeability to translocation of bacterial products is increased in cirrhosis. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) remain central to the interplay between the host and microbial milieu. We propose that Tregs are involved in promoting gut   and a balanced interaction with gut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty  (SCFAs). Carbon tetrachloride cirrhosis was induced in wild-type and recombination activating gene 1 () mice. Naive T cells and Treg cells were transferred into   mice. Intestinal permeability was assessed  after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) oral administration, and bacterial DNA presence was evaluated in mesenteric lymph nodes. Transcript and protein levels of tight-junction (TJ) proteins were measured in colonic tissue. Intestinal T helper profile in response to  () was determined by flow cytometry. SCFAs were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in colonic content before and after  challenge.   mice showed significantly increased permeability to LPS and bacterial DNA translocation rate compared with control mice. Naive T and Treg cotransfer significantly reduced gut permeability to bacterial antigen translocation and restored TJ protein expression in   mice. Naive T and Treg replenishment in   mice restrained proinflammatory differentiation of intestinal lymphocytes in response to . The main SCFA concentration resulted in significant reduction in   mice after  administration but remained unaltered after naive T and Tregs cotransfer. The reduced expression of SCFA receptors induced by  was reestablished following naive T and Treg reconstitution in   mice.  The restriction of gut permeability, local inflammatory differentiation, and loss of bacteria-derived SCFAs foster the value of Tregs in preventing bacterial translocation in cirrhosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30359717>Buccal delivery of small molecules - Impact of levulinic , oleic , sodium dodecyl sulfate and hypotonicity on ex vivo permeability and spatial distribution in mucosa.</a></h1><p>Studies of drug permeability rate and localization in buccal mucosa are essential to gain new knowledge of means such as chemical enhancers or osmolality to enhance buccal drug transport in the development of new buccal drug products. The transport of caffeine, diazepam and mannitol across porcine buccal mucosa was studied in modified Ussing chambers with a hypotonic donor solution, in the presence of levulinic  (LA), oleic  (OA), propylene glycol (PG) as well as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Subsequently, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization - mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) was applied to image the spatial distribution of caffeine, mannitol and SDS in cross-sections of porcine buccal mucosa. The results revealed that none of the permeation enhancing strategies improved the permeability of caffeine or diazepam, despite impact on the tissue  by OA and SDS, as seen by an increased permeability of mannitol. Further studies are needed with OA since PG solvent may have concealed the possible impact of OA. SDS decreased the permeability of caffeine and diazepam, a decrease which can be explained by micellar lipid extraction and encapsulation in micelles. MALDI-MSI showed that SDS permeated into approximately one-third of the epithelium, and it therefore appears that the main permeability  for mannitol is located in the outer epithelium. MALDI-MSI was shown to be a useful method for imaging spatial distribution of drugs and permeations enhancers in buccal mucosa.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Influence of size, shape and capping agent.</a></h1><p>Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have biomedical application on imaging and due to increased optical performance, star-shaped AuNPs are of special interest. Because shape, size and capping greatly influence their toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics, a systematic multiparametric comparative study of the influence of these parameters on the cytotoxicity, internalization, and in vitro permeability was conducted in human Cerebral Microvascular Endothelial Cell line (hCMEC/D3), an  model of the human blood-brain  (BBB). AuNPs of different size (14 nm and ∼50 nm), shape (spheres and stars), and coating (11-mercaptoundecanoic  or MUA and sodium citrate) were synthesized and fully characterized. The time- and concentration-dependent cytotoxic profile of the tested AuNPs differed for the different AuNPs. Generally, toxicity was greater for stars relative to sphere-shaped AuNPs, and citrate coating was more toxic than MUA. Regarding the influence of size, smaller-sized AuNPs were more cytotoxic when compared at the same Au concentration. However, when the concentration of AuNPs was expressed as the number of AuNPs/mL, a higher degree of cytotoxicity was noted for the larger ̴50 nm AuNPs. To understand the influence of size, shape and capping, a systematic study design, in which only one of the variables changes, is determinant for correct data interpretation. Considering the results herein presented, for the sake of comparison of differently-sized AuNPs, it is preferable to design the study based upon the number of nanoparticles, since at a fixed Au concentration the number of particles available to promote effect is higher for smaller-sized AuNPs. Cellular internalization also differed among the tested AuNPs; although all were unable to cross the in vitro BBB, the intracellularly accumulated AuNPs can induce cell damage and later compromise BBB  and permeability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31532211>Methionine and Its Hydroxyl Analogues Improve Stem Cell Activity To Eliminate Deoxynivalenol-Induced Intestinal Injury by Reactivating Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling.</a></h1><p>The intestinal epithelium is derived from intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and has direct contact with nutrients and toxins. However, whether methionine (Met) or a methionine hydroxyl analogue (2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)butanoic  (HMB)) can alleviate deoxynivalenol (DON)-induced intestinal injury remains unknown. Mice were treated orally with Met or HMB on days 1-11 and with DON on days 4-8. On day 12, the mice were sacrificed, and the jejunum was collected for crypt isolation and culture. Mouse enteroids were treated with DON and Met or HMB ex vivo. The results showed that Met and HMB increased the average daily feed intake and average daily gain of the mice. Met and HMB also improved the jejunal structure and   and promoted ISC expansion, as indicated by the increased enteroid formation efficiency and area, under DON-induced injury conditions. In addition, DON-induced decreases in ISC activity were rescued Wnt/β-catenin signaling reactivation by Met or HMB in vivo and ex vivo. Collectively, our findings reveal that Met and HMB alleviated DON-induced intestinal injury by improving ISC expansion and reactivating Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Our aim was to evaluate whether a probiotic product (Lactoflorene Plus) can prevent alterations in the immune response associated with self-reported stress and microbiota composition. Healthy adult volunteers who self-reported psychological stress were enrolled and randomised into a placebo and a probiotic group. Salivary stress markers (α-amylase, cortisol, chromogranin A) and immunological parameters (sIgA, NK cell activity, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α) in feces and the composition of intestinal microbiota were evaluated. Administration of the product did not exert a direct effect on the salivary stress markers or NK cell activity but did reduce abdominal pain and increase faecal IgA and IL-10 levels. The probiotic product induced a moderate increase in  and  spp., as expected, and in  spp., and decreased the size of the  spp. and  and  populations.

Here, piglets received a PBS vehicle or PBS suspension (2 ml, 10 CFU/ml) containing the  by oral gavage once a day during the period of 6-20 days of age prior to early weaning. Our data demonstrated that oral administration of  significantly improved the intestinal mucosal  and decreased the serum endotoxin and D-lactic  levels in early-weaned piglets (26 days of age). The intestinal tight junction proteins (including ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1) were significantly up-regulated by  administration. The serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, intestinal secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) levels, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) levels were significantly increased by  administration. Furthermore, our data revealed that oral administration of  significantly increased the relative abundances of health-promoting microbes (including ,  LA39, , and ) and decreased the relative abundances of opportunistic pathogens (including  and ). Functional alteration of the intestinal bacterial community by  administration was characterized by the significantly increased fatty  and protein metabolism and decreased diseases-associated metabolic pathways.

Besides its effect in blood pressure reduction, ZGXFD is also known to be a radical therapy with little or no side effects. Compared with western medicines, Chinese medicinal formulas have the advantage of simultaneously attacking multiple targets. However, such a property brings trouble to the pharmacological studies of Chinese medicines. This study investigated the composition of gut microbiota in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) treated with ZGXFD. ZGXFD was shown to cause similar effects in the treatment group as benazepril: both were able to reduce in SHR the microbial diversity, Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio and coccus to bacillus (C/B) ratio. Meanwhile, ZGXFD can maintain the  of intestinal mechanistic  and elevate the percentage of bacteria producing short chain fatty  (SCFA). By investigating renin-angiotensin system (RAS) system, we found that ZGXFD can decrease the expression of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) in lungs, which in turn causes a increase in AngI produces angiotensin1-7 (Ang1-7) and decrease in AngII.

A plant-based diet appears to be beneficial for human health by promoting the development of more diverse and stable microbial systems. Additionally, vegans and vegetarians have significantly higher counts of certain -related operational taxonomic units compared to omnivores. Fibers (that is, non-digestible carbohydrates, found exclusively in plants) most consistently increase lactic  bacteria, such as , and , and reduce  and  species. Polyphenols, also abundant in plant foods, increase  and , which provide anti-pathogenic and anti-inflammatory effects and cardiovascular protection. High fiber intake also encourages the growth of species that ferment fiber into metabolites as short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), including acetate, propionate, and butyrate. The positive health effects of SCFAs are myriad, including improved immunity against pathogens, blood-brain  , provision of energy substrates, and regulation of critical functions of the intestine. In conclusion, the available literature suggests that a vegetarian/vegan diet is effective in promoting a diverse ecosystem of beneficial bacteria to support both human gut microbiome and overall health. This review will focus on effects of different diets and nutrient contents, particularly plant-based diets, on the gut microbiota composition and production of microbial metabolites affecting the host health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30205690>Carbon nanodots: Opportunities and limitations to study their biodistribution at the human lung epithelial tissue .</a></h1><p>Inhalation of combustion-derived ultrafine particles (≤0.1 m) has been found to be associated with pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. However, correlation of the physicochemical properties of carbon-based particles such as surface charge and agglomeration state with adverse health effects has not yet been established, mainly due to limitations related to the detection of carbon particles in biological environments. The authors have therefore applied model particles as mimics of simplified particles derived from incomplete combustion, namely, carbon nanodots (CNDs) with different surface modifications and fluorescent properties. Their possible adverse cellular effects and their biodistribution pattern were assessed in a three-dimensional (3D) lung epithelial tissue model. Three different CNDs, namely, nitrogen, sulfur codoped CNDs ( ) and nitrogen doped CNDs (  and ), were prepared by microwave-assisted hydrothermal carbonization using different precursors or different microwave systems. These CNDs were found to possess different chemical and photophysical properties. The surfaces of nanodots  and  were positively charged or neutral, respectively, arguably due to the presence of amine and amide groups, while the surfaces of  were negatively charged, as they bear carboxylic groups in addition to amine and amide groups. Photophysical measurements showed that these three types of CNDs displayed strong photon absorption in the UV range. Both  and  showed weak fluorescence emission, whereas  showed intense emission. A 3D human lung model composed of alveolar epithelial cells (A549 cell line) and two primary immune cells, i.e., macrophages and dendritic cells, was exposed to CNDs via a pseudo-air-liquid interface at a concentration of 100 g/ml. Exposure to these particles for 24 h induced no harmful effect on the cells as assessed by cytotoxicity, cell layer , cell morphology, oxidative stress, and proinflammatory cytokines release. The distribution of the CNDs in the lung model was estimated by measuring the fluorescence intensity in three different fractions, e.g., apical, intracellular, and basal, after 1, 4, and 24 h of incubation, whereby reliable results were only obtained for . It was shown that  translocate rapidly, i.e., >40% in the basal fraction within 1 h and almost 100% after 4 h, while ca. 80% of the  and  were still located on the apical surface of the lung cells after 1 h. This could be attributed to the agglomeration behavior of  or . The surface properties of the  bearing amino and amide groups likely induce greater uptake as  could be detected intracellularly. This was less evident for , which bear carboxylic  groups on their surface. In conclusion, CNDs have been designed as model systems for carbon-based particles; however, their small size and agglomeration behavior made their quantification by fluorescence measurement challenging. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that the surface properties and agglomeration affected the biodistribution of the particles at the lung epithelial  .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580918>Phospholipids across scales: lipid patterns and plant development.</a></h1><p>Phospholipids are major building blocks of cell membranes and as such they have a key structural role in maintaining their  as a hydrophobic .

Rainbow trout were exposed to polystyrene (PS) MPs (100-400 μm) via feed for a period of 4 weeks. Fish were fed four types of diets: control, diets containing virgin PS particles, or particles exposed to two different environmental matrices (sewage or harbor effluent). Extrinsic  disturbance in intestinal tissue was evaluated via histology. The paracellular permeability toward ions and molecules was examined using Ussing chambers and mRNA expression analysis of tight junction proteins. Active transport was monitored as transepithelial potential difference, short-circuits current and uptake rate of amino  H-lysine. Immune status parameters were measured through mRNA expression level of cytokines, lysozyme activity, and hematological analysis of immune cells.

There is an urgent need to find alternatives to antibiotics as many salmonellae are now multidrug resistant. As such, specific beneficial bacteria and dietary fibers can be an alternative as they may prevent  Typhimurium (STM) infection and spreading by strengthening intestinal  function.  We tested whether immune active long-chain inulin-type fructans and/or  W37,  W63, and  W56 can strengthen   of intestinal Caco-2 cells in the presence and absence of a STM. Effects of the ingredients on intestinal  function were first evaluated by quantifying trans-epithelial electric resistance (TEER) and regulation of gene expression by microarray.

Based on computational docking studies, transcriptional activation experiments and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein immunofluorescence localization assays in cultured cells, 16α-hydroxytrametenolic  (HTA) was discovered as a novel GR agonist in this study. HTA ameliorates TNF-α-induced Caco-2 monolayer intestinal epithelial  damage and suppressed activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt), which attenuated downstream IκB and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) phosphorylation through GR activation.

Recent studies have shown that PDT can also open the blood-brain  (BBB). However, there are no optimized parameters of PDT for patients at different ages. To determine whether there are age differences in PDT effects on the BBB, we studied PDT-related BBB opening through the optical clearing skull window in healthy 4- and 8-week-old mice.In this work, we realized BBB opening by combining PDT with the optical clearing skull window by using different radiant exposures (635 nm, 10-20-30-40 J/cm ) and 5-aminole-vulinic  (5-ALA, 20 mg/kg). Then, we evaluated BBB permeability by: (i) spectrofluorimetric measuring of Evans Blue dye (EBd) leakage; (ii) confocal imaging of 70 kDa FITC-dextran extravasation and the BBB ; and (iii) histological analysis of brain tissues.Using the skull optical clearing method, we demonstrated PDT-induced BBB opening to EBd and FITC-dextran in a radiant exposure manner. The histological analysis revealed the different severities of vasogenic edema corresponding to radiant exposures. Besides, the PDT-related increase in the BBB permeability to high weight molecules (EBd and FITC-dextran) and solutes (vasogenic edema) was more pronounced in 4-week-old mice than in 8-week-old mice.The more pronounced PDT-induced BBB disruption in juvenile mice compared with adult mice suggests age differences in PDT-related BBB opening. This might be an important informative platform for a new application of PDT as a method for brain drug delivery, especially for post-surgical treatment of MGs. Lasers Surg.

To better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in acute HS-induced neurodegeneration we used a broad-spectrum proteomic analysis approach to identify key molecules and molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of acute HS-induced neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. Mice were subjected to acute inhalation exposure of up to750 ppm of HS. HS induced behavioral deficits and severe lesions including hemorrhage in the inferior colliculus (IC). The IC was microdissected for proteomic analysis. Tandem mass tags (TMT) liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based quantitative proteomics was applied for protein identification and quantitation. LC-MS/MS identified 598, 562, and 546 altered proteomic changes at 2 h, and on days 2 and 4 post-HS exposure, respectively. Of these, 77 proteomic changes were statistically significant at any of the 3 time points. Mass spectrometry data were subjected to Perseus 1.5.5.3 statistical analysis, and gene ontology heat map clustering. Expressions of several key molecules were verified to confirm HS-dependent proteomics changes. Webgestalt pathway overrepresentation enrichment analysis with Panther engine revealed HS exposure disrupted several biological processes including metabotropic glutamate receptor group 1 and inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathways among others. Further analysis showed that energy metabolism,  of blood-brain , hypoxic, and oxidative stress signaling pathways were also implicated. Collectively, this broad-spectrum proteomics data has provided important clues to follow up in future studies to further elucidate mechanisms of HS-induced neurotoxicity.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Notably, DEHP-induced testicular toxicity is related to oxidative stress, but the specific mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, we sought to investigate this mechanism and determine whether vitamin C and vitamin E administration would attenuate the BTB impairment induced by DEHP in vivo and by Mono-(2-Ethylhexyl) Phthalate (MEHP) in vitro, respectively.

Furthermore, Vitamin E and vitamin C could alleviate the oxidative stress, block DEHP-induced spermatogenesis dysfunction and BTB disruption by inhibiting p38 MAPK signaling pathway. In summary, vitamin E and vitamin C are good candidates for the treatment of DEHP-induced male infertility.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, therapeutic strategies to ameliorate lung injury without exerting side effects are not available. Functional amino  have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects under various conditions. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that arginine, glutamine, or glycine supplementation ameliorated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury in mice. Mice pretreated with aerosolized arginine, glutamine, or glycine were exposed to aerosolized LPS to induce lung injury. Results showed that arginine or glycine pretreatment beneficially reduced LPS-induced collagen deposition, apoptosis of alveolar cells, expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages in lung tissues of mice, thus contributing to improved alveolar  and function. Glutamine administration reduced LPS-induced collagen deposition and inflammatory cytokines without affecting any other parameters examined in the study. Our findings indicated that arginine or glycine pretreatment effectively alleviated LPS-induced lung injury by inhibiting the accumulation of lymphocytes, the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and the apoptosis of alveolar cells. Supplementation of arginine or glycine may be a novel nutritional strategy to reduce deleterious effects of bacterial infection on alveolar function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639376>The interplay among gut microbiota, hypertension and kidney diseases: The role of short-chain fatty .</a></h1><p>The bacteria community living in the gut maintains a symbiotic relationship with the host and its unbalance has been associated with progression of a wide range of intestinal and extra intestinal conditions. Hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are closely associated diseases with high incidence rates all over the world. Increasing data have supported the involvement of gut microbiome in the blood pressure regulation and the impairment of CKD prognosis. In hypertension, the reduced number of short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) producing bacteria is associated with modifications in gut environment, involving reduction of the hypoxic gut profile and worsening of the microbial balance, leading to a loss of epithelial  , development of gut inflammation and the reduction of SCFAs plasma levels. These modifications compromise the blood pressure regulation and, as a consequence, favor the end organ damage, also affecting the kidneys. In CKD, impaired renal function leads to accumulation of high levels of uremic toxins that reach the intestine and cause alterations in bacteria composition and fecal metabolite profile, inducing a positive feedback that allows translocation of endotoxins into the bloodstream, which enhances local kidney inflammation and exacerbate kidney injury, compromising even more CKD prognosis. In line with these data, the use of prebiotics, probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation are becoming efficient therapies to improve the gut dysbiosis aiming hypertension and CKD treatment. This review describes how changes in gut microbiota composition can affect the development of hypertension and the progression of kidney diseases, highlighting the importance of the gut microbial composition uncovering to improve human health maintenance and, especially, for the development of new alternative therapies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It is widely used as ingredients in a variety of food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. Animal studies have shown that consumption of aloe or purified aloin cause intestinal goblet cell hyperplasia, and malignancy. Here, we tested antibacterial effects of aloin, against intestinal commensal microbiota. Minimum inhibitory concentration of aloin for several human commensal bacterial species (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) ranged from 1 to 4 mg/ml. Metabolism studies indicated that  was capable of degrading aloin into aloe-emodin at a slower-rate compared to  spp. As a proof of concept, we incubated 3% rat fecal-slurry (an  model to simulate human colon content) with 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/ml of aloin to test antimicrobial properties. Low aloin concentrations showed minor perturbations to intestinal bacteria, whereas high concentration increased  sp. counts. Aloin also decreased butyrate-production in fecal microbiota in a dose-dependent manner after 24 h exposure. The 16S rRNA sequence-data revealed that aloin decreases the abundance of butyrate-producing bacterial species. Transepithelial resistant result revealed that aloin alters the intestinal barrier-function at higher concentrations (500 μM). In conclusion, aloin exhibits antibacterial property for certain commensal bacteria and decreases butyrate-production in a dose -dependent manner. HIGHLIGHTS     -Aloin exhibits antibacterial properties for certain intestinal commensal bacteria.     -In rat fecal slurry (an  model to simulate human colon content), longer aloin exposure (24 h) decreases the butyrate production in dose dependent manner.     -The 16s rRNA sequencing data show that aloin decreased the abundance of butyrate producing bacterial species.     -Rat intestinal commensal bacteria metabolized aloin into aloe-emodin.     -Aloin altered the intestinal epithelial cells barrier integrity, however, the metabolic product of aloin - Aloe-emodin did not alter epithelial cells permeability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31139758>Serum Bovine Immunoglobulins Improve Inflammation and Gut  Function in Persons with HIV and Enteropathy on Suppressive ART.</a></h1><p>Systemic inflammation persists in chronic HIV infection and is associated with increased rates of non-AIDS events such as cardiovascular and liver disease. Increased gut permeability and systemic exposure to microbial products are key drivers of this inflammation. Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) supports gut healing in other conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease.In this randomized, double-blind study, participants receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) with chronic diarrhea received placebo or SBI at 2.5 g BID or 5 g BID for 4 weeks, followed by a 20-week placebo-free extension phase with SBI at either 2.5 or 5 g BID. Intestinal fatty  binding protein (I-FABP), zonulin, flagellin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-binding protein, and inflammatory markers were measured by ELISA or multiplex assays. Non-parametric tests were used for analysis.One hundred three participants completed the study. By week 24 SBI significantly decreased circulating levels of I-FABP (-0.35 ng/μL, =0.002) and zonulin (-4.90 ng/μL, 0.003), suggesting improvement in gut damage, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (-0.40 pg/μL, =0.002), reflecting improvement in systemic inflammation. In participants with the lowest quartile of CD4+ T-cell counts at baseline (189-418 cells/μL), CD4+ T-cell counts increased significantly (26 cells/μL; =0.002).Oral SBI may decrease inflammation and warrants further exploration as a potential strategy to improve gut  and decrease systemic inflammation among persons receiving prolonged suppressive ART.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30923519>A Novel Postbiotic From  GG With a Beneficial Effect on Intestinal  Function.</a></h1><p>It has long been known that probiotics can be used to maintain intestinal homeostasis and treat a number of gastrointestinal disorders, but the underlying mechanism has remained obscure. Recently, increasing evidence supports the notion that certain probiotic-derived components, such as bacteriocins, lipoteichoic , surface layer protein and secreted protein, have a similar protective role on intestinal  function as that of live probiotics. These bioactive components have been named 'postbiotics' in the most recent publications. We previously found that the  GG (LGG) culture supernatant is able to accelerate the maturation of neonatal intestinal defense and prevent neonatal rats from oral  K1 infection. However, the identity of the bioactive constituents has not yet been determined. In this study, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, we identified a novel secreted protein (named HM0539 here) involved in the beneficial effect of LGG culture supernatant. HM0539 was recombinated, purified, and applied for exploring its potential bioactivity  and . Our results showed that HM0539 exhibits a potent protective effect on the intestinal , as reflected by enhancing intestinal mucin expression and preventing against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-induced intestinal  injury, including downregulation of intestinal mucin (MUC2), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and disruption of the intestinal . Using a neonatal rat model of  K1 infection via the oral route, we verified that HM0539 is sufficient to promote development of neonatal intestinal defense and prevent against  K1 pathogenesis. Moreover, we further extended the role of HM0539 and found it has potential to prevent dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis as well as LPS/D-galactosamine-induced bacterial translocation and liver injury. In conclusion, we identified a novel LGG postbiotic HM0539 which exerts a protective effect on intestinal  function. Our findings indicated that HM0539 has potential to become a useful agent for prevention and treatment of intestinal  dysfunction- related diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481750>Small heat shock protein CRYAB inhibits intestinal mucosal inflammatory responses and protects   through suppressing IKKβ activity.</a></h1><p>Alpha B-crystallin (CRYAB) is an important member of the small heat shock protein family, and plays a protective and therapeutic role in neurological inflammation. CRYAB expression was assessed in cultured HT29 and Caco-2 cells and inflamed mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colitis models in mice. Lentivirus-overexpressing and CRSIPR/Cas9 systems were used in different cells to upregulate and silence CRYAB expression, respectively. Cell permeable recombined fusion protein TAT-CRYAB was injected intraperitoneally into dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice to assess its anti-inflammatory effects. CRYAB was found to be significantly decreased in the inflamed mucosa from IBD patients and DSS-induced colitis in mice, and negatively correlated with the levels of TNF-α and IL-6, respectively. Enforced expression of CRYAB suppressed expression of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8) via inhibiting the IKK complex formation, whereas lack of CRYAB expression markedly enhanced proinflammatory responses. Consistently, administration of TAT-CRYAB fusion protein significantly alleviated DSS- or TNBS-induced colitis in mice and protected intestinal  . CRYAB regulates inflammatory response in intestinal mucosa by inhibiting IKKβ-mediated signaling and may serve as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30354988>Angioedema and Hemorrhage After 4.5-Hour tPA (Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator) Thrombolysis Ameliorated by T541 via Restoring Brain Microvascular .</a></h1><p>Background and Purpose- tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator) is the only recommended intravenous thrombolytic agent for ischemic stroke. However, its application is limited because of increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation beyond the time window. T541 is a Chinese compound medicine with potential to attenuate ischemia and reperfusion injury. This study was to explore whether T541-benefited subjects underwent tPA thrombolysis extending the time window. Methods- Male C57BL/6 N mice were subjected to carotid artery thrombosis by stimulation with 10% FeCl followed by 10 mg/kg tPA with/without 20 mg/kg T541 intervention at 4.5 hours. Thrombolysis and cerebral blood flow were observed dynamically until 24 hours after drug treatment. Neurological deficit scores, brain edema and hemorrhage, cerebral microvascular junctions and basement membrane proteins, and energy metabolism in cortex were assessed then. An in vitro hypoxia/reoxygenation model using human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells was used to evaluate effect of T541 on tight junctions and F-actin in the presence of tPA. Results- tPA administered at 4.5 hours after carotid thrombosis resulted in a decrease in thrombus area and survival rate, whereas no benefit on cerebral blood flow. Study at 24 hours after tPA administration revealed a significant angioedema and hemorrhage in the ischemia hemisphere, a decreased expression of junction proteins claudin-5, zonula occludens-1, occludin, junctional adhesion molecule-1 and vascular endothelial cadherin, and collagen IV and laminin. Meanwhile, ADP/ATP, AMP/ATP, and ATP5D (ATP synthase subunit) expression and activities of mitochondria complex I, II, and IV declined, whereas malondialdehyde and 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine increased and F-actin arrangement disordered. All the insults after tPA treatment were attenuated by addition of T541 dose dependently. Conclusions- The results suggest T541 as a potential remedy to attenuate delayed tPA-related angioedema and hemorrhage and extend time window for tPA treatment. The potential of T541 to upregulate energy metabolism and protect blood-brain  is likely attributable to its effects observed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30634696>Calcium Pyruvate Exerts Beneficial Effects in an Experimental Model of Irritable Bowel Disease Induced by DCA in Rats.</a></h1><p>Pyruvate is a normal constituent of the body that participates in carbohydrate metabolism and functions as a scavenger of free radicals. Calcium pyruvate monohydrate (CPM) is a more stable derivative that has proved its anti-inflammatory effect in experimental colitis, among other disorders, and that could also be considered a source of calcium. Thus, it would be useful for the treatment of diseases with an inflammatory component and a high prevalence of osteoporosis like the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of CPM in a rat model of chronic post-inflammatory visceral pain induced by deoxycholic  (DCA) that resembles IBS. Rats were administered DCA for three days intracolonically and then treated daily with CPM (40 and 100 mg/kg) or gabapentin (70 mg/kg) (positive control) by oral gavage for 17 days. The treatments reduced the visceral hypersensitivity measured by response to colorectal distension and referred pain. DCA induced changes in the colonic immune response characterized by increased expression of the cytokine  and the inducible enzyme , which was reduced by the treatments. DCA also decreased the gut expression of the mucins  and , which was normalized by CPM, whereas gabapentin only increased significantly . Moreover, DCA increased the expression of , which was decreased to basal levels by all the treatments. However, the serotonin receptor , which was also elevated, was not affected by any of the treatments, indicating no effect through this signalling pathway. In conclusion, CPM ameliorated the visceral hypersensitivity and the referred pain caused by DCA, being as effective as the control drug. Furthermore, it improved the immune status of the animals, which could contribute to the visceral analgesia and the regeneration of the intestinal epithelial  .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980845>The effects of dihydroxyphenyl lactic  on alleviating blood-brain  injury following subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats.</a></h1><p>In this study, the protective effects of 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl lactic  (DLA) on blood-brain  (BBB) injury following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has been explored.Male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight 300-350 g) were used to establish the SAH model using the endovascular perforation method. The animals were randomly divided into four groups: sham (n = 40), SAH (n = 46), SAH + vehicle (n = 44), and SAH + DLA (n = 40) treatment groups. At 1 h after SAH, either DLA (10 mg/kg) or normal saline (vehicle) was administered by femoral vein injection. The effects of DLA on mortality, neurological function, brain water content, and BBB were observed. Additionally, immunohistochemistry and western blot techniques were applied to investigate the mechanism of action of DLA.We found that the administration of DLA (10 mg/kg) following SAH could improve neurological functions, reduce brain water content, and maintain BBB . The expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic factors such as toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), NF-κB (p-p65), tumor necrosis factor-α, p-p38 MAPK, p-p53, and caspase-3 were significantly increased after SAH. These same factors were markedly attenuated following treatment with DLA.These findings showed that DLA can alleviate BBB injury following SAH through its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects via suppression of TLR4 and its downstream NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

To this end, anti-inflammatory mechanisms of several phytochemicals such as curcumin, resveratrol, propolis, polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs), and ginsenosides have been extensively studied. However, correlation of the phytochemicals with neuroinflammation or brain nutrition is not fully considered, especially in their therapeutic mechanism for neuronal damage or dysfunction. In this article, we review the advance in antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of phytochemicals and discuss the potential communication with brain microenvironment by improved gastrointestinal function, enhanced systemic immunity, and neuroprotective outcomes. These data show that phytochemicals may modulate and suppress neuroinflammation of the brain by several approaches: (1) reducing systemic inflammation and infiltration via the blood-brain  (BBB), (2) direct permeation into the brain parenchyma leading to neuroprotection, (3) enhancing  of disrupted BBB, and (4) vagal reflex-mediated nutrition and protection by gastrointestinal function signaling to the brain. Therefore, many phytochemicals have multiple potential neuroprotective approaches contributing to therapeutic benefit for pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, and development of strategies for preventing these diseases represents a considerable public health concern and socioeconomic burden.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30983357>Large-Scale Quantitative Comparison of Plasma Transmembrane Proteins between Two Human Blood-Brain  Model Cell Lines, hCMEC/D3 and HBMEC/ciβ.</a></h1><p>Transmembrane (TM) proteins localized at the plasma membrane, such as transporters and receptors, play important roles in regulating the selective permeability of the blood-brain  (BBB). The purpose of the present study was to clarify the differences in the expression levels of TM proteins in the plasma membrane between two established human BBB model cell lines, hCMEC/D3 and HBMEC/ciβ, in order to assist researchers in selecting the most appropriate cell line for particular purposes. We first confirmed that plasma membranes could be enriched sufficiently for a quantitative proteomics study by using the Plasma Membrane Protein Extraction Kit provided by BioVision with a modified protocol. This method was applied to hCMEC/D3 and HBMEC/ciβ cells, and fractions were used for untargeted quantitative proteomics based on sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment-ion spectra. In the plasma membrane fractions, 345 TM proteins were quantified, among which 135 showed significant expression differences between the two cell lines. In hCMEC/D3 cells, amino  transporters SNAT1, SNAT2, SNAT5, ASCT1, CAT1, and LAT1; adenosine 5'-triphosphate-binding cassette transporters P-gp and MRP4; and GLUT1 were more highly expressed. The transferrin receptor expression was also 4.56-fold greater in hCMEC/D3 cells. In contrast, HBMEC/ciβ cells expressed greater levels of IgG transporter neonatal Fc receptor, as well as tight-junction proteins PECAM1, JAM1, JAM3, and ESAM. Our results suggest that hCMEC/D3 cells have greater efflux transport, amino  transport, and transferrin receptor-mediated uptake activities, whereas HBMEC/ciβ cells have greater IgG-transport activity and tight-junction .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574297>Plant protein diet suppressed immune function by inhibiting spiral valve intestinal mucosal  , anti-oxidation, apoptosis, autophagy and proliferation responses in amur sturgeon (Acipenser schrenckii).</a></h1><p>An 8-week growth trial was conducted to investigate the effects of replacing dietary fishmeal with a plant protein blend on the growth performance, mucosal   and the related regulation mechanism in Amur Sturgeon (Acipenser schrenckii) with initial weight of 87.48 g. Three isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets were prepared.

Although essential amino , fatty , and available phosphorus had been balanced according to the nutrient requirement of sturgeon, compared with the fish of P0 and P50, the full plant protein diet (P100) significantly reduced growth performance and survival, and accompanied with serious spiral valve intestinal (SVI) damage. The increased tissue necrosis and failed responses in anti-oxidation, programming apoptosis, autophagy and cell proliferation system were regulated by inhibiting ERK1 phosphorylation, which indicated that SVI hypoimmunity and functional degradation were the main reasons for the high mortality and low utilization ability of plant protein in Amur sturgeon.Copyright © 2019.

The VDR is activated by 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and plays an important role in maintaining  of the intestinal mucosal . LCA can also substitute for vitamin D to carry out the in vivo functions of vitamin D. However, it is unclear whether activation of the VDR by LCA affects mucosal  function. In the present study, we researched the protective effect of LCA on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced intestinal epithelial  dysfunction in Caco-2 cells of the human epithelial intestinal adenocarcinoma cell line. Caco-2 cell monolayers were pretreated with LCA and then exposed to 100 ng/mL TNF-α. The results showed that LCA alleviated the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in FITC-Dextran flux induced by TNF-α. LCA ameliorated the TNF-α-induced decrease in protein expression and distribution of ZO-1, E-cadherin, Occludin, and Claudin-1, which are tight junction markers. Additionally, the LCA treatment effectively counteracted TNF-α-mediated downregulation of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1, which are related to oxidative stress. Increases in NF-κB p-p65 and p-IκB-α induced by TNF-α were significantly inhibited by LCA. Considering all these, the present study indicates that LCA has a significant protective effect on TNF-α-induced injury of intestinal  function through the VDR and suggests that suppressing NF-κB signaling and activating the SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway might be one of the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of LCA.Copyright © 2019.

Growing evidence suggests that human homeostasis depends on a mutualistic relationship with gut bacteria that produce a number of biologically active compounds. Therefore, enteric microbiota dysbiosis with gut  disruption may be an important factor in the development of chronic inflammatory diseases. The aim of our study was to assess non-invasive markers of intestinal   in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. Concentrations of claudin-3 (intestinal epithelial tight junction structure) and intestinal fatty  binding protein (I-FABP; marker of enterocyte damage) were determined in the blood of patients with chronic plaque psoriasis (n = 20) and healthy individuals (n = 20) using commercially available enzyme-linked immunoassay test kits. Claudin-3 concentration was higher in patients with psoriasis compared with healthy control (median, 54.07 vs 42.36 ng/mL; P < 0.001). Patients with psoriasis also had elevated concentration of plasma I-FABP (median, 708.8 vs 147.1 pg/mL; P < 0.05). Our results support the hypothesis that dysfunction of the intestinal  in psoriasis disturbs the homeostatic equilibrium between the microbiota and immune system.

Due to the time-limited treatment window, within 4.5 h of stroke onset, and a variety of potentially deadly complications related to delayed administration, particularly hemorrhagic transformation (HT), clinical use of tPA is limited. Combination therapies with other interventions, drug or nondrug, have been hypothesized as a logical approach to enhancing tPA effectiveness. Here, we discuss various potential pharmacological and nondrug treatments to minimize adverse effects, primarily HT, associated with delayed tPA administration. Pharmacological interventions include many that support the  of the blood-brain  (i.e., atorvastatin, batimastat, candesartan, cilostazol, fasudil, and minocycline), promote vascularization and preserve cerebrovasculature (i.e., coumarin derivative IMM-H004 and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor), employing other mechanisms of action (i.e., oxygen transporters and ascorbic ). Nondrug treatments are comprised of stem cell transplantation and gas therapies with multi-faceted approaches. Combination therapy with tPA and the aforementioned treatments demonstrated promise for mitigating the adverse complications associated with delayed tPA treatment and rescuing stroke-induced behavioral deficits. Therefore, the conjunctive therapy method is a novel therapeutic approach that can attempt to minimize the limitations of tPA treatment and possibly increase the therapeutic window for ischemic stroke treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040055>Epstein-Barr Virus dUTPase Induces Neuroinflammatory Mediators: Implications for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.</a></h1><p>Neuroinflammation is a common feature in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), affecting 85%-90% of all patients, yet the underlying mechanism or mechanisms responsible for the initiation and/or promotion of this process is largely unknown. Multiple reports, however, have suggested a role for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), in particular, in ME/CFS, but its potential role, if any, in the neuroinflammatory process has not been addressed. In support of this premise, studies by our group have found that the EBV protein deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) induces anxiety and sickness behaviors in female mice. We also found that a small subset of patients with ME/CFS exhibited prolonged and significantly elevated neutralizing antibodies against EBV dUTPase protein in serum, which inversely correlated with ME/CFS symptoms. A larger ME/CFS case-control cohort study further confirmed that a significant percentage of patients with ME/CFS (30.91%-52.7%) were simultaneously producing antibodies against multiple human herpesviruses-encoded dUTPases and/or human dUTPase. Altogether, these findings suggest that EBV dUTPase protein may be involved in the neuroinflammatory process observed in ME/CFS. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the EBV dUTPase protein could contribute to neuroinflammation by altering the expression of genes involved with maintaining blood-brain  (BBB)  and/or modulating synaptic plasticity.With the use of human immortalized astrocytes, microglia, and cerebral microvascular endothelial cells, we conducted time-course (0-24 h) experiments with EBV dUTPase protein (10 μg/mL) to determine what effect(s) it may have on the expression of genes involved with BBB permeability, astrocytes and microglia cell function, tryptophan metabolism, and synaptic plasticity by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In parallel, in vivo studies were conducted in female C57Bl/6 mice. Mice were injected by the intraperitoneal route with EBV dUTPase protein (10 μg) or vehicle daily for 5 days, and the brains were collected and processed for further qRT-PCR analysis of the in vivo effect of the dUTPase on the dopamine/serotonin and γ-aminobutyric /glutamate pathways, which are important for brain function, using RT Profiler PCR Arrays.EBV dUTPase protein altered the expression in vitro (12 of 15 genes and 32 of 1000 proteins examined) and in vivo (34 of 84 genes examined) of targets with central roles in BBB /function, fatigue, pain synapse structure, and function, as well as tryptophan, dopamine, and serotonin metabolism.The data suggest that in a subset of patients with ME/CFS, the EBV dUTPase could initiate a neuroinflammatory reaction, which contributes to the fatigue, excessive pain, and cognitive impairments observed in these patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we characterize acute pathophysiological changes in the brain of sheep exposed to smoke inhalation, with- and without third-degree skin burn that models the injuries sustained by human victims of fire accidents. Blood-brain   and hemorrhage were analyzed throughout the brain using specific histological stains: Hematoxylin & Eosin, Luxol fast blue, Periodic -Schiff (PAS), and Martius, Scarlet and Blue (MSB). Our data show that, following smoke inhalation injury, alone and in combination with third-degree skin burn, there was a significant increase in the number of congested and dilated blood vessels in the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, amygdala, hippocampus, pons, cerebellum, and pituitary gland as compared to sham-injured controls. Positive PAS staining confirmed damage to the basement membrane of congested and dilated blood vessels throughout the brain. Severe rupturing of blood vessels, microvascular hemorrhaging and bleeding throughout the brain was also observed in the injured groups. No significant changes in hemodynamics and PaO2 were observed. Our data demonstrate for the first time that acute smoke inhalation alone results in diffuse blood-brain  dysfunction and massive bleeding in the brain in the absence of hypoxia and changes in hemodynamics. These findings provide critical information and prompt further mechanistic and interventional studies necessary to develop effective and novel treatments aimed at alleviating CNS dysfunction in patients with smoke and burn injuries.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31086953>Recent advances in intestinal alkaline phosphatase, inflammation, and nutrition.</a></h1><p>In recent years, much new data on intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) have been published, and major breakthroughs have been disclosed. The aim of the present review is to critically analyze the publications released over the last 5 years. These breakthroughs include, for example, the direct implication of IAP in intestinal tight junction  and  function maintenance; chronic intestinal challenge with low concentrations of Salmonella generating long-lasting depletion of IAP and increased susceptibility to inflammation; the suggestion that genetic mutations in the IAP gene in humans contribute to some forms of chronic inflammatory diseases and loss of functional IAP along the gut and in stools; stool IAP as an early biomarker of incipient diabetes in humans; and omega-3 fatty  as direct inducers of IAP in intestinal tissue. Many recent papers have also explored the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of IAP and other alkaline phosphatase (AP) isoforms in various experimental settings and diseases. Remarkably, nearly all data confirm the potent anti-inflammatory properties of (I)AP and the negative consequences of its inhibition on health. A simplified model of the body AP system integrating the IAP compartment is provided. Finally, the list of nutrients and food components stimulating IAP has continued to grow, thus emphasizing nutrition as a potent lever for limiting inflammation.© The Author(s) 2019.

The ECM provides a porous substrate critical for nutrient exchange and cellular adhesion. The enterocytes within the epithelial monolayer possess proteins such as transporters, carriers, pumps and channels that participate in the movement of drugs, metabolites, ions and amino  and whose function can be regulated or altered by the properties of the ECM. Here, we characterized expression and function of proteins involved in transport across the human small intestinal epithelium grown on two different culture platforms. One strategy employs a conventional scaffolding method comprised of a thin ECM film overlaying a porous membrane while the other utilizes a thick ECM hydrogel placed on a porous membrane. The thick hydrogel possesses a gradient of chemical cross-linking along its length to provide a softer substrate than that of the ECM film-coated membrane while maintaining mechanical stability.The monolayers on both platforms possessed goblet cells and abundant enterocytes and were impermeable to Lucifer yellow and fluorescein-dextran (70 kD) indicating high  . Multiple transporter proteins were present in both primary-cell culture formats at levels similar to those present in freshly isolated crypts/villi; however, expression of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) in the monolayers on the conventional scaffold was substantially less than that on the gradient cross-linked scaffold and freshly isolated crypts/villi. Monolayers on the conventional scaffold failed to transport the BCRP substrate prazosin while cells on the gradient cross-linked scaffold successfully transported this drug to better mimic the properties of in vivo small intestine.The results of this comparison highlight the need to create in vitro intestinal transport platforms whose characteristics mimic the  in order to accurately recapitulate epithelial function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29874129>Retinoic  signaling is essential for maintenance of the blood-retinal .</a></h1><p>The predominant function of the blood-retinal  (BRB) is to maintain retinal homeostasis by regulating the influx and efflux between the blood and retina. Breakdown of the BRB occurs in a number of ocular diseases that result in vision loss. Understanding the molecular and cellular pathways involved in the development and maintenance of the BRB is critical to developing therapeutics for these conditions. To visualize the BRB in vivo, we used the transgenic Tg(l-fabp:DBP-EGFP:flk1:mCherry) zebrafish model that expresses vitamin D binding protein (a member of the albumin gene family) tagged to green fluorescent protein. Retinoic  (RA) plays a number of important roles in vertebrate development and has been shown to play a protective role during inflammation-induced blood-brain  disruption. The role of RA in BRB development and maintenance remains unknown. To disrupt RA signaling, Tg(l-fabp:DBP-EGFP:flk1:mCherry) zebrafish were treated with N, N-diethylaminobenzaldehyde and 4-[(1 E)-2-[5,6-dihydro-5,5-dimethyl-8-(2-phenylethynyl)-2-naphthalenyl]ethenyl]benzoic , which are antagonists of retinal dehydrogenase and the RA receptor, respectively. Treatment with either compound resulted in BRB disruption and reduced visual acuity, whereas cotreatment with all- trans RA effectively rescued BRB . Additionally, transgenic overexpression of Cyp26a1, which catalyzes RA degradation, resulted in breakdown of the BRB. Our results demonstrate that RA signaling is critical for maintenance of the BRB and could play a role in diseases such as diabetic macular edema.-Pollock, L. M., Xie, J., Bell, B. A., Anand-Apte, B.

In this study, we described that  sphingomyelinase (ASM) derived from endothelial cells plays a critical role in BBB disruption in aging. ASM levels were elevated in the brain endothelium and plasma of aged humans and mice, resulting in BBB leakage through an increase in caveolae-mediated transcytosis. Moreover, ASM caused damage to the caveolae-cytoskeleton via protein phosphatase 1-mediated ezrin/radixin/moesin dephosphorylation in primary mouse brain endothelial cells. Mice overexpressing brain endothelial cell-specific ASM exhibited acceleration of BBB impairment and neuronal dysfunction. However, genetic inhibition and endothelial specific knock-down of ASM in mice improved BBB disruption and neurocognitive impairment during aging. Results of this study revealed a novel role of ASM in the regulation of BBB  and neuronal function in aging, thus highlighting the potential of ASM as a new therapeutic target for anti-aging.

Systemic delivery requires crossing of the air-blood , however with molecular size-dependent limitations in lung absorption of large molecules. Systemic availability after inhalation can be improved by absorption enhancers, such as bile salts. Enhancers may potentially interfere with the different constituents of the lungs, e.g. the lung surfactant lining the alveoli or the lung epithelium. We used two in vitro models to investigate the potential effects of bile salts on lung surfactant function (with the constrained drop surfactometer) and on the epithelium in the proximal airways (with the MucilAir™ cell system), respectively. In addition, we measured direct effects on respiration in mice inhaling bile salt aerosols. The bile salts inhibited lung surfactant function at different dose levels, however they did not affect the  of ciliated cells at the tested doses. Furthermore, the bile salt aerosols induced changes in the breathing pattern of mice indicative of pulmonary irritation. The bile salts were ranked according to potency in vitro for surfactant function disruption and in vivo for induction of pulmonary irritation. The ranking was the same, suggesting a correlation between the interference with lung surfactant and the respiratory response.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Following stimulation with cyclophosphamide, the inhibition of the elevated levels of TAK1/NF-κB and phospho-TAK1/NF-κB by ESWT and GPR120 agonists in RT4 cells was associated with a suppression of NF-κB translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus. Accordingly, this anti-inflammatory effect was abolished by GPR120 antagonist and knockdown of GPR120. Histologically, bladder inflammation in cyclophosphamide-treated rats was suppressed by GW9508 or ESWT. Masson's trichrome and Sirius red staining revealed that cyclophosphamide treatment enhanced synthesis of extracellular matrix in rats that was reversed by GW9508 or ESWT. Upregulated pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines in the cyclophosphamide-treated rats were also suppressed in the GW9508- or ESWT-treated rats. The significantly increased inflammatory cell infiltration as well as the impaired urothelial  of the bladder after cyclophosphamide treatment were reversed by treatment with GW9508 or ESWT.These findings suggest that GPR120, the sensing receptor for ESWT, may be useful in the treatment of interstitial cystitis by inhibiting inflammatory response in bladder cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30724927>Protective effects of a novel probiotic strain, Lactococcus lactis ML2018, in colitis: in vivo and in vitro evidence.</a></h1><p>Multiple articles have confirmed that an imbalance of the intestinal microbiota is closely related to aberrant immune responses of the intestines and to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Probiotic strains have been identified for the treatment and prevention of IBDs. The aim of this study was to screen a new probiotic strain with anti-inflammatory activity and investigate the potential mechanisms underlying its activity. We identified a new probiotic strain, L. lactis ML2018, that has anti-inflammatory properties and was isolated from traditional fermented food. In an in vitro experiment, L. lactis ML2018 prevented the release of nitric oxide (NO) and the production of inflammatory factors induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in RAW264.7 cells. The in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of L. lactis ML2018 were evaluated using a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced animal model of colitis. Oral administration of L. lactis ML2018 significantly ameliorated colitis induced by DSS, which included preventing a decrease in body weight, shortening of the colon length and apoptosis of epithelial cells. L. lactis ML2018 could inhibit DSS-induced intestinal inflammation by preventing the overproduction of proinflammatory factors, suppressing the infiltration of macrophages, controlling the fibrosis, improving the  of the intestinal epithelial  and upregulating the concentrations of short-chain fatty  (SCFAs). Moreover, L. lactis ML2018 could prevent inflammation by inhibiting the activation of the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. These data suggest that L. lactis ML2018 could have therapeutic potential for treating IBDs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31556210>Abundance of Probiotics and Butyrate-Production Microbiome Manages Constipation via Short-Chain Fatty  Production and Hormones Secretion.</a></h1><p>The characteristics of gut microbiota and host metabolism are hypothesized to be associated with constipation status, but the regulation mechanism is not fully understood. Thus, the current study investigates the effect of constipation symptoms on gut functionality following the modulation of gut microbiota and metabolites via dietary fiber intervention.Constipation causes a significantly reduced short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) production and a higher level of iso-butyrate. The feces of constipated people are characterized with inhibited Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcaceae and Roseburia abundance. Desulfovibrionaceae is identified to be an important endotoxin producer in constipated patients, and a butyrate-enriched SCFAs profile achieved by dietary fiber supplement accelerates gastrointestinal transit and increases the thickness of the mucosal layer, possibly through triggering the secretion of colonic hormones and enhancing the expression of tight junction proteins for maintaining intestinal  . More importantly, an interacting regulatory mechanism among SCFAs, in particular butyrate and propionate, may be involved in signaling between the microbiome and host cells in the colon.Gut microbiota, characterized with enriched butyrate-producing and depressed Desulfovibrionaceae bacteria, attenuates constipation symptoms through promoting intestinal hormones secretion and maintaining gut  .© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, such sites are often rare in the genome and could result from mutational processes or technical artifacts. Few methods are yet available to specifically detect footprints of trans-species balancing selection without using trans-species polymorphic sites. In this study, we develop summary- and model-based approaches that are each specifically tailored to uncover regions of long-term balancing selection shared by a set of species by using genomic patterns of intraspecific polymorphism and interspecific fixed differences. We demonstrate that our trans-species statistics have substantially higher power than single-species approaches to detect footprints of trans-species balancing selection, and are robust to those that do not affect all tested species. We further apply our model-based methods to human and chimpanzee whole-genome sequencing data. In addition to the previously established major histocompatibility complex and malaria resistance-associated FREM3/GYPE regions, we also find outstanding genomic regions involved in   and innate immunity, such as the GRIK1/CLDN17 intergenic region, and the SLC35F1 and ABCA13 genes. Our findings not only echo the significance of pathogen defense but also reveal novel candidates in maintaining balanced polymorphisms across human and chimpanzee lineages. Finally, we show that these trans-species statistics can be applied to and work well for an arbitrary number of species, and integrate them into open-source software packages for ease of use by the scientific community.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605678>Parabacteroides distasonis Alleviates Obesity and Metabolic Dysfunctions via Production of Succinate and Secondary Bile .</a></h1><p>We demonstrated the metabolic benefits of Parabacteroides distasonis (PD) on decreasing weight gain, hyperglycemia, and hepatic steatosis in ob/ob and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Treatment with live P. distasonis (LPD) dramatically altered the bile  profile with elevated lithocholic  (LCA) and ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) and increased the level of succinate in the gut. In vitro cultivation of PD demonstrated its capacity to transform bile  and production of succinate.

Gavage with a mixture of LCA and UDCA reduced hyperlipidemia by activating the FXR pathway and repairing gut  . Co-treatment with succinate and LCA/UDCA mirrored the benefits of LPD. The binding target of succinate was identified as fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, the rate-limiting enzyme in IGN.

The PVN is a major source of excitatory drive to the spinal sympathetic outflow via both direct and indirect projections. In this review, we discuss the role of the PVN in the regulation of sympathetic output in normal physiological conditions and in hypertension. In normal healthy animals, the PVN presympathetic neurons do not appear to have a major role in sustaining resting sympathetic vasomotor activity or in regulating sympathetic responses to short-term homeostatic challenges such as acute hypotension or hypoxia. Their role is, however, much more significant during longer-term challenges, such as sustained water deprivation, chronic intermittent hypoxia, and pregnancy. The PVN also appears to have a major role in generating the increased sympathetic vasomotor activity that is characteristic of multiple forms of hypertension. Recent studies in the spontaneously hypertensive rat model have shown that impaired inhibitory and enhanced excitatory synaptic inputs to PVN presympathetic neurons are the basis for the heightened sympathetic outflow in hypertension. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the presynaptic and postsynaptic alterations in GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs to PVN presympathetic neurons in hypertension. In addition, we discuss the ability of exercise training to correct sympathetic hyperactivity by restoring blood-brain  , reducing angiotensin II availability, and decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation in the PVN.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30563553>Hyperpolarized [1-13C] pyruvate MR spectroscopy detect altered glycolysis in the brain of a cognitively impaired mouse model fed high-fat diet.</a></h1><p>Higher dietary intakes of saturated fatty  increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and dementia, and even in people without diabetes higher glucose levels may be a risk factor for dementia. The mechanisms causing neuronal dysfunction and dementia by consuming high-fat diet degrading the  of the blood-brain  (BBB) has been suggested but are not yet fully understood, and metabolic state of the brain by this type of insult is still veiled. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of high-fat diet on the brain metabolism by a multimodal imaging method using the hyperpolarizedcarbon 13 (C)-pyruvate magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging in conjunction with the biochemical assay and the behavior test in a mouse model fed high-fat diet (HFD). In mice were fed 60% HFD for 6 months, hyperpolarized [1-C] pyruvate MR spectroscopy showed decreased perfusion (p < 0.01) and increased conversion from pyruvate to lactate (p < 0.001) in the brain. The hippocampus and striatum showed the highest conversion ratio. The functional  of the blood-brain  tested by dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging showed no difference to the control. Lactate was increased in the cortex (p < 0.01) and striatum (p < 0.05), while PDH activity was decreased in the cortex (p < 0.01) and striatum (p < 0.001) and the phosphorylated PDH was increased in the striatum (p < 0.05). Mice fed HFD showed less efficiency in learning memory compared with control (p < 0.05). To determine whether hyperpolarized C-pyruvate magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy could detect a much earier event in the brain. Mice fed HFD for 3 months did not show a detectable cognitive decline in water maze based learning memory. Hyperpolarized [1-C] pyruvate MR spectroscopy showed increased lactate conversion (P < .001), but no difference in cerebral perfusion. These results suggest that the increased hyperpolarized [1-C] lactate signal in the brain of HFD-fed mice represent that altered metabolic alteration toward to glycolysis and hypoperfusion by the long-term metabolic stress by HFD further promote to glycolysis. The hyperpolarized [1-C] pyruvate MR spectroscopy can be used to monitor the brain metabolism and will provide information helpful to understand the disease process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31211921>Gut microbiota determines the prevention effects of  (L.) Roem supplementation against obesity and associated metabolic disorders induced by high-fat diet.</a></h1><p>The gut microbiota, identified as the target for vegetables, can affect the development of obesity and associated metabolic syndromes. As a medicinal and edible plant,  (L.) Roem (LC) has abundant nutrients that can effectively reduce obesity risk. However, the interaction between the prevention effects of LC against obesity and the modulating gut microbiota of LC remain obscure. This study demonstrated LC supplementation improved high-fat diet (HFD)-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis and significantly enhanced short-chain fatty  (SCFA)-producing bacteria (, ) along with SCFA content accumulation in the gut. Meanwhile, LC supplementation substantially restored gut  damage in long-term HFD treatment. Moreover, LC supplementation improved HFD-induced overweight, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation. Gene expression profiles showed that LC displayed an important impact on hepatic lipid transport and lipid synthesis (sterol regulatory element binding transcriptional factor 1cperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ signaling pathway). More importantly, an antibiotic treatment experiment demonstrated that the beneficial effects of LC in reducing obesity risk largely depended on the gut microbiota, especially SCFA-producing bacteria (, ). Therefore, LC supplementation improved gut microbiota dysbiosis  enhancing SCFA-producing bacteria (, ), maintained gut  integrity, and alleviated the development of obesity. Overall, LC would provide a potential dietary intervention strategy against obesity and enteral homeostasis dysbiosis through modulating the gut microbiota.-Zhang, L., Shi, M., Ji, J., Hu, X., Chen, F.

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a single fat-rich meal on  functions and inflammatory status on human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs), furthermore we assess the effects of mixture of palmitic  and 25-hydroxycholesterol (PA +25OHCH) on  of endothelial cells and their inflammatory properties. HUVECs were induced with serum of healthy volunteers taken before, and 3 h after, the consumption of a meal with a standardized daily required dose of fats. In addition, endothelial cells were induced with PA +25OHCH (800 μM/L+10 μg/mL). Total cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high sensitivity c-reactive protein, and glucose were measured at fasting and postprandially. HUVEC  was measured in the RTCA-DP xCELLigence system. mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-33, IL-32, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), CX3C-chemokine, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) occludin, and VE-cadherin was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Viability and apoptosis were assessed in flow cytometry. The level of VEGF and IL-33 in fasting and postprandial serum was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Three hours after consumption of a fatty meal, all patients displayed increased levels of TGs and Toll-like receptors (110 ± 37 mg/dL versus 182 ± 64 mg/dL  < 0.05) (24 ± 11 mg/dL versus 42 ± 14 mg/dL  < 0.05). Postprandial serum and PA +25OHCH caused >20% decrease of HUVEC  than fasting serum ( < 0.001). HUVEC disintegration was accompanied by a decrease of occludin mRNA expression as compared with fasting serum ( < 0.05). The fatty meal affected neither VE-cadherin mRNA expression nor its apoptosis ( > 0.05). Mixture of PA +25OHCH caused decrease of VE-cadherin mRNA expression as compared with fasting serum ( < 0.01). PA +25OHCH did not affect HUVEC apoptosis ( > 0.05). Postprandial serum and PA +25OHCH caused increase of IL-33, MCP-1, ICAM-1, IL-32, VEGF, and CX3C-chemokine mRNA expression as compared with fasting serum ( < 0.05). Moreover, level of VEGF in fatty serum was significantly higher ( < 0.001).

However, the underlying mechanisms require further investigation.The aim of this study was to determine the role of butyrate, an SCFA, in the regulation of obesity, low-grade chronic inflammation, and alterations of microbiota composition in mice.Male C57BL/6J mice, 4-5 wk of age, were divided into 3 groups (n = 8 mice/group): low-fat diet (LFD; 10% energy from fat), high-fat diet (HFD; 45% energy from fat), or high-fat diet plus sodium butyrate (HSB). HSB mice received sodium butyrate at a concentration of 0.1 M in drinking water for 12 wk. Measures of inflammation, obesity, and intestinal  were assessed. Serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations were measured in the 3 groups. Fecal samples were collected for gut microbiota analysis.In HFD mice, body weight gain and hepatic triglyceride (TG), serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), and serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels were 1-4 times higher than those in LFD mice (P < 0.05); they were 34-42% lower in HSB mice compared with HFD mice (P < 0.05). The HFD group had 28%-48% lower mRNA expression of both Tjp1 and Ocln in the ileum and colon compared with levels in LFD or HSB mice (P < 0.05), whereas there was no difference in expression levels between LFD and HSB mice. Furthermore, in HSB mice, serum LPS concentration was 53% lower compared with that in HFD mice but still 23% higher than that in LFD mice (P < 0.05). Results from principal component analysis showed that HSB and LFD mice had a similar gut microbiota structure, which was significantly different from that in HFD mice (P < 0.05).Sodium butyrate administration beneficially changed HFD-induced gut microbiota composition and improved intestinal , leading to lower serum LPS concentrations.

We hypothesize that alterations in intestinal metabolite and microbiota profiles specific to each monosaccharide are involved. Two groups of six adult C57BL/6 mice were fed for 10-weeks with diets with glucose (G) or fructose (F) as sole carbohydrates, and a third group was fed with a normal chow carbohydrate mixture (N). Fecal metabolites were profiled by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and microbial composition by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Although N, G and F mice exhibited similar weight gains (with slight slower gains for F) and glucose tolerance, multivariate analysis of NMR data indicated that F mice were separated from N and G, with decreased butyrate and glutamate and increased fructose, succinate, taurine, tyrosine, and xylose. The different sugar diets also resulted in distinct intestinal microbiota profiles. That associated with fructose seemed to hold more potential to induce host metabolic disturbances compared to glucose, mainly by promoting bile  deconjugation and taurine release and compromising intestinal  . This may reflect the noted nonquantitative intestinal fructose absorption hence increasing its availability for microbial metabolism, a subject for further investigation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471875>A Method to Prepare Claudin-Modulating Recombinant Proteins.</a></h1><p>The epithelium forms tight junctions by sealing the paracellular space, and tight junctions prevent the free movement of solutes. Claudin is an important structural and functional component of tight junctions and contributes to the formation of paracellular pathways for different populations of size- and charge-selective solutes. Therefore, modulation of tight junctions is important to develop drug delivery strategies. Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) causes food poisoning in humans and is a 35-kDa polypeptide, consisting of 319 amino  and two functional regions. The C-terminal region of CPE (C-CPE) is not cytotoxic and binds to its receptor claudin, which in turn modulates the epithelial tight junction . Thus, claudin binders, such as C-CPE, are useful tools for drug delivery targeting tight junctions.

Diabetes increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Primary bile  are synthesized in hepatocytes and are transformed to secondary bile  in the intestine by gut bacteria. Bile  are nutrient sensors and metabolic integrators that regulate lipid, glucose, and energy homeostasis by activating nuclear farnesoid X receptor and membrane Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5. Bile  control gut bacteria overgrowth, species population, and protect the  of the intestinal . Gut bacteria, in turn, control circulating bile  composition and pool size.

UDCA is also a long-established drug, largely used for the dissolution of cholesterol gallstones, the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis and other hepatobiliary disorders. The history of UDCA is briefly retraced here as well as its multifactorial mechanism of action, based on its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cytoprotective activities. The present review is centred around the anticancer properties of UDCA and synthetic antitumor derivatives designed over the past 20 years. Paradoxically, depending on the conditions, UDCA exhibits both pro- and anti-apoptotic properties toward different cell types. In particular, the UDCA drug can protect epithelial cells from damages and apoptosis while inducing inhibition of proliferation and apoptotic and/or autophagic death of cancer cells. The effects of UDCA on cancer cell migration, cancer stem cells and drug-induced dysbiosis are also evoked. The drug has revealed modest activities against colon and gastric cancers but may be useful to improve treatments of hepatocellular carcinoma, notably in combination with other drugs such as sorafenib. UDCA can also protect from damages induced by cancer chemotherapeutic agents. The potential of UDCA in cancer, as a chemo-protecting or chemotherapeutic agent, is highlighted here as well as the design of tumour-active derivatives, including UDCA-drug conjugates.

Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare changes between groups and linear regression models to quantify associations between gut markers, insulin resistance, body mass index (BMI), and visceral, subcutaneous, and total adipose tissue (VAT, SAT, and TAT).: 90% were male and 48% were White non-Hispanic. The median age was 36 years, HIV-1 ribonucleic  was 4.56 log10 copies/mL, and CD4 count was 338 cells/µL. An overall 1.7-fold increase in I-FABP was observed throughout 96 weeks, with no difference between arms. Zonulin levels increased with RAL compared to protease inhibitor-based regimens (week 96, P = .02); minimal changes in I-BABP or LBP levels were observed. Higher baseline I-FABP levels were associated with increases in VAT, TAT, and BMI (16%, 9%, and 2.5%, respectively; P < .04) over 96 weeks.While ART induces changes in the markers of gut  dysfunction, the extent to which they improve or worsen the gut  function remains unclear. Nevertheless, markers of gut  dysfunction in ART-naive individuals predict increases in total and visceral abdominal fat with treatment initiation.© The Author(s) 2018.

Corneal  was determined by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Quantitative PCR arrays were utilized to investigate expression of 84 phase I/II metabolizing enzymes and 84 drug transporter genes. Permeability was evaluated using model compounds with a wide range of hydrophobicity, molecular weight, and excipients. Finally, different formulations of latanoprost and bimatoprost were administered and drug absorption and tissue viability and  were investigated.Histologic assessment and TEER of the corneal tissue model revealed tissue structure, thickness, and  formation (1000 ± 146 Ω·cm2) comparable to native human corneal epithelium. The 3D corneal tissue expressed tight junctions, mucins, and key corneal epithelial detoxification enzymes. Drug-metabolizing enzyme and transporter gene expression in 3D corneal tissue and excised human corneal epithelium were highly correlated (r2 = 0.87). Coefficients of permeation for model drugs in the tissue model and excised rabbit corneas also showed a high correlation (r2 = 0.94). As expected, latanoprost and bimatoprost free  had much lower permeability (Papp = 1.2 × 10-6 and 1.9 × 10-6) than the corresponding prodrugs (Papp = 2.5 × 10-5 and 5.6 × 10-5), respectively. The presence of 0.02% benzalkonium chloride in ophthalmic formulations significantly affected tissue  and viability.The newly developed 3D corneal tissue model appears to be very useful for evaluation of corneal drug permeability and safety during ophthalmic drug development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30248349>p-Coumaric  as a prophylactic measure against normobaric hypoxia induced pulmonary edema in mice.</a></h1><p>Previous studies indicate that the anti-hypoxia effects of Tibetan Turnip (Brassica rapa ssp. rapa) were closely related to its characteristic components being p-coumaric  (CA) and p-coumaric ‑β‑d‑glucopyranoside (CAG). Since CAG would be converted to CA in vivo, this study aims to further examine the efficacy and mechanism of CA against pulmonary edema induced by normobaric hypoxia.Male ICR mice were assigned to the normoxia group and several hypoxia groups, given sterile water, CA or dexamethasone orally, once daily for four consecutive days. One hour after the final gavage, mice in the above hypoxia groups were put into the normobaric hypoxia chamber (9.5% O) for 24 h while mice in normoxia group remained outside the chamber. After hypoxia exposure, lung water content (LWC), pulmonary vascular permeability, the protein content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), plasma total nitrate/nitrite (NO) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) content, histological and ultra-microstructure analyses were performed. Expression of occludin was assayed by immunohistochemistry.In a hypoxic environment of 9.5% O, mice treated with 100 mg/kg body wt CA had significantly lower LWC and BALF protein content than mice in the hypoxia vehicle group. Meanwhile, mice in CA group showed intact lung blood-gas-, increased levels of plasma total NO, decreased levels of plasma ET-1 and upregulation of occludin expression.CA exerts preventive effects against normobaric hypoxic pulmonary edema in mice, its mechanisms involved improving the  of the lung , inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

A substantial body of literature now points to E4 as a driver of multiple impairments seen in AD, including blunted brain insulin signaling, mismanagement of brain cholesterol and fatty , reductions in blood brain  (BBB) , and decreased cerebral glucose uptake. Various neuroimaging techniques, in particular positron emission topography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have been instrumental in characterizing these metabolic and vascular deficits associated with this important AD risk factor.

The aim of this study was to determine the nature and source of metabolic  contributing to acidosis in patients with severe falciparum malaria.A prospective observational study was conducted to characterize circulating  in adults with P. falciparum malaria (n = 107) and healthy controls (n = 45) from Bangladesh using high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics. Additional in vitro P. falciparum culture studies were performed to determine if parasites release the  detected in plasma from patients with severe malaria acidosis.We identified previously unmeasured plasma  strongly associated with acidosis in severe malaria. Metabolomic analysis of P. falciparum parasites in vitro showed no evidence that these  are released by the parasite during its life cycle. Instead, 10 of the plasma  could be mapped to a gut microbial origin. Patients with malaria had low L-citrulline levels, a plasma marker indicating reduced gut  . Longitudinal data showed the clearance of these newly identified  was delayed in fatal cases.These data suggest that a compromise in intestinal  function may contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of life-threatening acidosis in severe falciparum malaria..© The Author(s) 2018.

A total of 120 1-d-old male broilers (Ross 308) were assigned to 4 treatment groups with 6 replicates of 5 birds per cage. The experiment was designed in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with LH (0 or 120 mg/kg) and LPS (injection of saline or 1.5 mg/kg body weight) as treatments. On days 14, 16, 18, and 20 of the trial, broilers were intraperitoneally injected with LPS or physiological saline. Compared with the control group, LPS-challenged broilers showed impaired growth performance (P < 0.05) from day 15 to day 21 of the trial, increased serum diamine oxidase (DAO) and D-lactic  (D-LA) levels coupled with reduced glutathione (GSH) content and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity (duodenal and jejunal mucosa), reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content (duodenal, jejunal, and ileal mucosa), and compromised morphological structure of the duodenum and jejunum. Additionally, LPS challenge increased (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes and reduced tight junction (TJ) protein expression in the jejunum. However, dietary LH prevented LPS-induced reductions in average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) in broilers. It also alleviated LPS challenge-induced increases in serum DAO levels, MDA content (duodenal and jejunal mucosa), and jejunal crypt depth (P < 0.05) but reduced villus height, GSH content (jejunal mucosa), and T-SOD activity (duodenal and jejunal mucosa) (P < 0.05). Additionally, LH supplementation significantly downregulated the mRNA expression of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and upregulated the mRNA expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and Occludin in the jejunal mucosa induced by LPS (P < 0.05). On the other hand, LH administration prevented LPS-induced activation of the p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and attenuated IkB alpha (IκBα) phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB (p65) in the jejunal mucosa. In conclusion, dietary LH supplementation attenuates intestinal mucosal disruption mainly by accelerating the expression of TJ proteins and inhibiting activation of the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway.© The Author(s) 2019.

Taking into account the beneficial health-promoting effects of GABA, the presence of the  gene, encoding glutamate decarboxylase that converts L-glutamate to GABA, was analyzed in Lactic  Bacteria (LAB) natural isolates from Zlatar cheese. The results revealed that 52% of tested  spp. and 8% of  spp. isolates harbor the  gene. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of GABA production performed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed the highest GABA production by  BGZLS10-17. Since high GABA-producing LAB natural isolates are the most valuable source of naturally produced GABA, the probiotic properties of BGZLS10-17 were characterized. This study demonstrated high adhesion of BGZLS10-17 strain to Caco-2 cells and the ability to decrease the adhesion of  ATCC25922 and  C29039. Treatment of differentiated Caco-2 cells monolayer with BGZLS10-17 supernatant containing GABA alleviated inflammation (production of IL-8) caused by IL-1β and significantly stimulated the expression of tight junction proteins (zonulin, occludin, and claudin 4), as well as the expression of  cytokine leading to the conclusion that immunosuppression and strengthening the tight junctions can have significant role in the maintenance of intestinal epithelial  . Taken together the results obtained in this study support the idea that using of GABA producing BGZLS10-17 probiotic strain could be a good strategy to modulate immunological response in various inflammatory diseases, and at the same time, it could be a good candidate for adjunct starter culture for production of GABA-enriched dairy foods and beverages offering new perspectives in designing the novel functional foods.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30339173>Deoxycholic  disrupts the intestinal mucosal  and promotes intestinal tumorigenesis.</a></h1><p>High-fat diet, which leads to an increased level of deoxycholic  (DCA) in the intestine, is a major environmental factor in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, evidence relating to bile  and intestinal tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of DCA on the intestinal mucosal  and its impact on the development of CRC. Here we showed that DCA disrupted cell monolayer  and increased proinflammatory cytokine production in intestinal cancer and precancerous cell lines (Caco-2 and IMCE). Apcmin/+ mice receiving DCA increased the number and size of intestinal adenomas and promoted the adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence. Importantly, DCA induced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, increased the production of inflammatory cytokines, and led to intestinal low grade inflammation. A reduction of tight junction protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and the number of intestinal cells including goblet cells and Paneth cells was also observed after DCA treatment. Moreover, DCA significantly reduced the level of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), and promoted the polarization of M2 macrophages in the intestine of Apcmin/+ mice. In conclusion, these data suggested that DCA induced intestinal low grade inflammation and disrupted the mucosal physical and functional barriers, aggravating intestinal tumorigenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31419514>Microbiota-driven gut vascular  disruption is a prerequisite for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis development.</a></h1><p>Fatty liver disease, including non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH), has been associated with increased intestinal  permeability and translocation of bacteria or bacterial products into the blood circulation. In this study, we aimed to unravel the role of both intestinal   and microbiota in NAFLD/NASH development.C57BL/6J mice were fed with high-fat diet (HFD) or methionine-choline-deficient diet for 1 week or longer to recapitulate aspects of NASH (steatosis, inflammation, insulin resistance). Genetic and pharmacological strategies were then used to modulate intestinal  .We show that disruption of the intestinal epithelial  and gut vascular  (GVB) are early events in NASH pathogenesis. Mice fed HFD for only 1 week undergo a diet-induced dysbiosis that drives GVB damage and bacterial translocation into the liver. Fecal microbiota transplantation from HFD-fed mice into specific pathogen-free recipients induces GVB damage and epididymal adipose tissue enlargement. GVB disruption depends on interference with the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, as shown by genetic intervention driving β-catenin activation only in endothelial cells, preventing GVB disruption and NASH development. The bile  analogue and farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic  (OCA) drives β-catenin activation in endothelial cells. Accordingly, pharmacologic intervention with OCA protects against GVB disruption, both as a preventive and therapeutic agent. Importantly, we found upregulation of the GVB leakage marker in the colon of patients with NASH.We have identified a new player in NASH development, the GVB, whose damage leads to bacteria or bacterial product translocation into the blood circulation. Treatment aimed at restoring β-catenin activation in endothelial cells, such as administration of OCA, protects against GVB damage and NASH development.The incidence of fatty liver disease is reaching epidemic levels in the USA, with more than 30% of adults having NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), which can progress to more severe non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Herein, we show that disruption of the intestinal epithelial  and gut vascular  are early events in the development of NASH. We show that the drug obeticholic  protects against  disruption and thereby prevents the development of NASH, providing further evidence for its use in the prevention or treatment of NASH.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

In addition to hemostasis, Plts also function to stabilize the vasculature and maintain endothelial cell (EC)  . We hypothesized that Plt-EVs would inhibit vascular EC permeability, similar to fresh Plts. To investigate this hypothesis, we used in vitro and in vivo models of vascular endothelial compromise and bleeding.In the vitro model, Plt-EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and characterized for Plt markers and particle size distribution. Effects of Plts and Plt-EVs on endothelial  function were assessed by transendothelial electrical resistance measurements and histological analysis of endothelial junction proteins. Hemostatic potential of Plt-EVs and Plts was assessed by multiple electrode Plt aggregometry. Using an in vivo model, the effects of Plts and Plt-EVs on vascular permeability and bleeding were assessed in non-obese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice by an established Miles assay of vascular permeability and a tail snip bleeding assay.In the in vitro model, Plt-EVs displayed exosomal size distribution and expressed Plt-specific surface markers. Platelets and Plt-EVs decreased EC permeability and restored EC junctions after thrombin challenge. Multiplate aggregometry revealed that Plt-EVs enhanced thrombin receptor-activating peptide-mediated aggregation of whole blood, whereas Plts enhanced thrombin receptor-activating peptide-, arachidonic -, collagen-, and adenosine diphosphate-mediated aggregation. In the in vivo model, Plt-EVs are equivalent to Plts in attenuating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A-induced vascular permeability and uncontrolled blood loss in a tail snip hemorrhage model.Our study is the first to report that Plt-EVs might provide a feasible product for transfusion in trauma patients to attenuate bleeding, inhibit vascular permeability, and mitigate the endotheliopathy of trauma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30382478>Dietary Zinc-Amino  Complex Does Not Affect Markers of Mammary Epithelial  or Heat Stability of Milk in Mid-Lactating Cows.</a></h1><p>Supplying dietary zinc in excess of traditional requirements has clear impacts on the gut epithelium, but little research has explored whether similar impacts on the mammary epithelium may occur. Our objective was to determine the effects of supplemental Zn sources, in excess of minimal requirements, on markers of mammary epithelial  in blood and in milk as well as the heat stability of milk in mid-lactation cows. Twelve multiparous Holstein cows (132 ± 21 days in milk and 51 ± 3 kg/day milk) were blocked according to milk yield and enrolled in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square experiment. Experimental periods were 21 days, with 17 days allowed for diet adaptation and 4 days for sampling. Treatment sequences were randomly assigned to animals and treatments were as follows: (1) 0.97 g Zn/day provided as ZnSO (34.5 mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 30-ZS), (2) 1.64 g Zn/day provided as ZnSO (56.5 mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 60-ZS), and (3) 0.55 g Zn/day provided as ZnSO plus 1.13 g Zn/day provided as a zinc-methionine complex (58.2 mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 60-ZM). Treatments were administered once daily as an oral bolus containing all supplemental trace minerals. Rumen-bypass methionine was also included in the 30-ZS and 60-ZS boluses to provide metabolizable methionine equivalent to that provided in 60-ZM rations. Milk samples were assessed for electrolytes, somatic cell transcript abundance of genes related to zinc metabolism, and heat coagulation time. Whole blood samples were analyzed for Na and K concentrations, and plasma samples were analyzed for lactose concentration. Cows fed 60-ZS or 60-ZM had greater zinc intake compared to 30-ZS. Dry matter intake and milk fat content tended to be greater in 60-ZS and 60-ZM cows compared to 30-ZS. Somatic cell linear score was similar among treatments. Treatments neither affected markers of mammary epithelial  in blood nor in milk of cows, including plasma concentration of lactose, milk concentrations of Na and K, and SLC30A2 and CLU transcript abundance. Treatments had no effect on milk N fractions or heat coagulation time. This study provided no evidence that supplemental Zn above the established requirements can improve blood-milk epithelial  or heat stability of milk in healthy mid-lactation dairy cows.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129422>Pharmacological stimulation of G-protein coupled receptor 40 alleviates cytokine-induced epithelial  disruption in airway epithelial Calu-3 cells.</a></h1><p>Impairment of airway tight junctions induced by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines is implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory airway diseases. Pharmacological stimulation of G-protein coupled receptor (GPR) 40, a receptor of polyunsaturated fatty , have recently been shown to promote tight junction assembly in airway epithelial cells under non-inflammatory conditions. However, roles of GPR40 in regulating airway epithelial  in response to inflammatory insults are unknown. This study was aimed to investigate the effect of GPR40 stimulation on proinflammatory cytokine (TNFα and IL-1β)-induced tight junction disruption in human airway epithelial Calu-3 cells using GW9508, a GPR40 agonist. We found that stimulation of GPR40 by GW9508 attenuated the cytokine-induced airway epithelial  leakage as analyzed by measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance and transepithelial flux of fluorescently labeled dextran (molecular weight of 4 kDa). Furthermore, GW9508 prevented the cytokine-induced dislocalization of zonula occludens (ZO)-1, occludin and claudin-1. The -protective effect of GW9508 was abolished by a GPR40 antagonist, but not a GPR120 antagonist. Immunofluorescence staining of NF-ĸB indicated that GW9508 had no effect on cytokine-induced NF-ĸB activation. Intriguingly, GW9508 inhibited cytokine-induced airway epithelial  disruption through suppression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in a phospholipase C (PLC) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta (CaMKKβ)-dependent manner. Collectively, this study uncovered the novel role of GPR40 in preventing cytokine-induced tight junction disruption in airway epithelial cells through mechanisms involving PLC-CaMKKβ-mediated suppression of ERK signaling. Pharmacological stimulation of GPR40 may be beneficial in the treatment of airway diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we find that  sphingomyelinase (ASM) is a critical factor for regulating brain endothelial  . ASM is increased in brain endothelium and/or plasma of aged humans and aged mice, leading to BBB disruption by increasing caveolae-mediated transcytosis. Genetic inhibition and endothelial-specific knockdown of ASM in mice ameliorated BBB breakdown and neurocognitive impairment during aging. Using primary mouse brain endothelial cells, we found that ASM regulated the caveolae-cytoskeleton interaction through protein phosphatase 1-mediated ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) dephosphorylation and apoptosis. Moreover, mice with conditional ASM overexpression in brain endothelium accelerated significant BBB impairment and neurodegenerative change. Overall, these results reveal a novel role for ASM in the control of neurovascular function in aging, suggesting that ASM may represent a new therapeutic target for anti-aging.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Serum/plasma concentrations of zonulin (a regulator of enterocyte tight junctions), tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin), intestinal fatty  binding protein (IFABP)/ileal bile  binding protein (IBABP), D-lactate, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein were measured.Zonulin concentrations were significantly higher when a concurrent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of blood-brain  (BBB) disruption (Gad+ RRMS) and were correlated with tight junction proteins. IBABP and D-lactate were elevated in people with RRMS compared to controls, but did not discriminate between Gad+ and Gad- subgroups. Baseline zonulin concentrations were associated with 1-year disease progression in progressive MS.People with MS have altered biomarkers of intestinal  . Zonulin concentrations are associated with 1-year disease progression in progressive MS and closely mirror BBB breakdown in RRMS. Zonulin may mediate breakdown of both the intestinal  and the BBB in gut dysbiosis through the regulation of tight junctions.

In this study, we measured circulating nucleic  in patient-derived orthotopically implanted xenograft (PDOX) models of GBM ( = 64) and show that tumor size and cell proliferation, but not the  of the blood-brain  or cell death, affect the release of ctDNA in treatment-naïve GBM PDOX. Analysis of fragment length profiles by shallow genome-wide sequencing (<0.2× coverage) of host (rat) and tumor (human) circulating DNA identified a peak at 145 bp in the human DNA fragments, indicating a difference in the origin or processing of the ctDNA. The concentration of ctDNA correlated with cell death only after treatment with temozolomide and radiotherapy. Digital PCR detection of plasma tumor mitochondrial DNA (tmtDNA), an alternative to detection of nuclear ctDNA, improved plasma DNA detection rate (82% vs. 24%) and allowed detection in cerebrospinal fluid and urine. Mitochondrial mutations are prevalent across all cancers and can be detected with high sensitivity, at low cost, and without prior knowledge of tumor mutations via capture-panel sequencing. Coupled with the observation that mitochondrial copy number increases in glioma, these data suggest analyzing tmtDNA as a more sensitive method to detect and monitor tumor burden in cancer, specifically in GBM, where current methods have largely failed. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that detection of tumor mitochondrial DNA is more sensitive than circulating tumor DNA analysis to detect and monitor tumor burden in patient-derived orthotopic xenografts of glioblastoma.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30394384>An In Vivo Method for Evaluating the Gut-Blood  and Liver Metabolism of Microbiota Products.</a></h1><p>The gut-blood  (GBB) controls the passage of nutrients, bacterial metabolites and drugs from intestinal lumen to the bloodstream. The GBB  is disturbed in gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, which may result in easier access of biologically active compounds, such as gut bacterial metabolites, to the bloodstream. Thus, the permeability of the GBB may be a marker of both intestinal and extraintestinal diseases. Furthermore, the increased penetration of bacterial metabolites may affect the functioning of the entire organism. Commonly used methods for studying the GBB permeability are performed ex vivo. The accuracy of those methods is limited, because the functioning of the GBB depends on intestinal blood flow. On the other hand, commonly used in vivo methods may be biased by liver and kidney performance, as those methods are based on evaluation of urine or/and peripheral blood concentrations of exogenous markers. Here, we present a direct measurement of GBB permeability in rats using an in vivo method based on portal blood sampling, which preserves intestinal blood flow and is virtually not affected by the liver and kidney function. Polyurethane catheters are inserted into the portal vein and inferior vena cava just above the hepatic veins confluence. Blood is sampled at baseline and after administration of a selected marker into a desired part of the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we present several applications of the method including (1) evaluation of the colon permeability to TMA, a gut bacterial metabolite, (2) evaluation of liver clearance of TMA, and (3) evaluation of a gut-portal blood-liver-peripheral blood pathway of gut bacteria-derived short-chain fatty . Furthermore, the protocol may also be used for tracking intestinal absorption and liver metabolism of drugs or for measurements of portal blood pressure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31245390>Physiological Effects of Dietary Amino  on Gut Health and Functions of Swine.</a></h1><p>Gut health has significant implications for swine overall health status and nutrient utilization, due to its various functions including digestion and absorption of nutrients, secretion of mucins and immunoglobulins, and selective  protection against harmful antigens and pathogens. Both the basic anatomical structure of the gut (such as epithelial cells) and its luminal microbiota play important roles for maintaining gut health and functions. The interactions between epithelial cells and luminal microbiota have significant impact on host nutrition and health through the metabolism of dietary components. Amino , which are major nutrients for pigs, are not only obligatory for maintaining the intestinal mucosal mass and integrity, but also for supporting the growth of microorganisms in the gut. Dietary amino  are the major fuel of the small intestinal mucosa. Particularly, glutamate, glutamine, and aspartate are the major oxidative fuel of the intestine. Emerging evidence shows that arginine activates the mTOR signaling pathway in the small intestine. Utilization of glycine by the small intestinal mucosa to synthesize glutathione is a very important physiological pathway, and the role of glycine as a powerful cytoprotectant has also been recognized. The major end products of methionine and cysteine metabolism are glutathione, homocysteine and taurine, which play important roles in the intestinal immune and anti-oxidative responses. Threonine is highly utilized by the gut and is particularly important for mucin synthesis and maintenance of gut  integrity. Moreover, either a deficiency or an excess of dietary threonine can reduce the synthesis of intestinal mucosal proteins and mucins in young pigs. Various new functions of amino  on gut health and functions have been discovered in recent years. Thus, this review is to provide some up-to-date knowledge for industry application of dietary amino  in order to enhance swine gut health and functions, and also it is to provide a comprehensive reference for further scientific research in this regard.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647994>Palmitic  damages gut epithelium  and initiates inflammatory cytokine production.</a></h1><p>The mechanisms leading to the low-grade inflammation observed during obesity are not fully understood. Seeking the initiating events, we tested the hypothesis that the intestine could be damaged by repeated lipid supply and therefore participate in inflammation. In mice, 1-5 palm oil gavages increased intestinal permeability via decreased expression and mislocalization of junctional proteins at the cell-cell contacts; altered the intestinal bacterial species by decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, segmented filamentous bacteria, and Clostridium leptum; and increased inflammatory cytokine expression. This was further studied in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2/TC7 cells using the two main components of palm oil, i.e., palmitic and oleic .

Inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis prevented part of these effects. Altogether, our data show that short exposure to palm oil or palmitic  induces intestinal dysfunctions targeting   and inflammation.

The production of 20-HETE is elevated after the onset of both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes; on the other hand, subjects with genetic variants in  and  that reduce 20-HETE production are more susceptible to stroke. This review summarizes recent genetic variants in  and  influencing 20-HETE production and discusses the role of 20-HETE in hypertension and the susceptibility to the onset, progression, and prognosis of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30287477>The Phosphate Binder Ferric Citrate Alters the Gut Microbiome in Rats with Chronic Kidney Disease.</a></h1><p>In chronic kidney disease (CKD), the gut microbiome is altered and bacterial-derived uremic toxins promote systemic inflammation and cardiovascular disease. Ferric citrate complex is a dietary phosphate binder prescribed for patients with end-stage kidney disease to treat hyperphosphatemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Iron is an essential nutrient in both microbes and mammals. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that the large iron load administered with ferric citrate in CKD may significantly change the gut microbiome. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 5/6 nephrectomy to induce CKD. Normal control and CKD rats were randomized to regular chow or a 4% ferric citrate diet for 6 weeks. Fecal and cecal microbial DNA was analyzed via 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq system. CKD rats had lower abundances of Firmicutes and  compared with normal rats and had lower overall gut microbial diversity. CKD rats treated with ferric citrate had improved hemoglobin and creatinine clearance and amelioration of hyperphosphatemia and hypertension. Ferric citrate treatment increased bacterial diversity in CKD rats almost to levels observed in control rats. The tryptophanase-possessing families Verrucomicrobia, Clostridiaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae were increased by ferric citrate treatment. The uremic toxins indoxyl sulfate and -cresyl sulfate were not increased with ferric citrate treatment. Verrucomicrobia was largely represented by , which has important roles in mucin degradation and gut  . In summary, ferric citrate therapy in CKD rats was associated with significant changes in the gut microbiome and beneficial kidney and blood pressure parameters.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30558299>Deoxynivalenol Impairs Porcine Intestinal Host Defense Peptide Expression in Weaned Piglets and IPEC-J2 Cells.</a></h1><p>Host defense peptides (HDPs) are efficient defense components of the innate immune system, playing critical roles in intestinal homeostasis and protection against pathogens. This study aims to investigate the interference effects of DON on the intestinal porcine HDPs expression in piglets and intestinal porcine epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) cells, and elucidate the underlying mechanisms through which it functions. In an animal experiment, intestinal HDPs were determined in weaned piglets fed control and 1.28 mg/kg or 2.89 mg/kg DON-contaminated diets. Dietary exposure to DON significantly decreased piglet average daily gain, increased intestinal permeability and depressed the expression of porcine β-defensin1 (pBD1), pBD2, pBD3, epididymis protein 2 splicing variant C (pEP2C), PMAP23, and proline/arginine-rich peptide of 39 amino  (PR39) in the intestine ( < 0.05). In IPEC-J2 cells, DON decreased cell viability and inhibited the expression of pBD1, pBD3, pEP2C, PG1-5, and PR39 ( < 0.05). NOD2, key regulator that is responsible for HDPs production, was markedly downregulated, whereas caspase-12 was activated in the presence of DON. In conclusion, DON induced caspase-12 activation and inhibited the NOD2-mediated HDPs production, which led to an impaired intestinal   of weaned piglets. Our study provides a promising target for future therapeutic strategies to prevent the adverse effects of DON.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31143767>Identification of Serum Biomarkers for Intestinal Integrity in a Broiler Chicken Malabsorption Model.</a></h1><p>Intestinal health is essential for feed efficiency and growth in animal agriculture and is dependent on  , inflammation and dysbiosis. Our laboratory has published a nutritional model to induce gut inflammation using rye as a source of energy in poultry. More recently, we have used this model as an assessment of a nutritional rehabilitation model for better understanding of childhood undernutrition. The objective of this brief research report was to use a well-establish malabsorption model in broiler chickens using corn and rye as an energy source to identify several intestinal health biomarkers in the serum. To screen for inflammatory biomarkers, seven commercially available tests were used including Griess, superoxide dismutase, thiobarbituric  reactive substances, Total antioxidant capacity, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase, Citrulline, and Interferon-ɤ; total IgA from cloacal swab was also measured. In the present study, chickens fed rye had a significant ( < 0.05) reduction in body weight and body weight gain at 10 day when compared with chickens that received the corn diet. In the second phase of the experiment, chickens that remain with the corn diet had significant differences in body weight and body weight gain. No significant differences were observed for any of the four antioxidant biomarkers evaluated in the sera ( > 0.05). However, significant differences were observed in serum citrulline and IFN-ɤ, as well as in cloacal IgA, in broiler chickens fed with rye, suggesting their potential use as biomarkers to study intestinal inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29922168>Co-expression Analysis of Sirtuins and Related Metabolic Biomarkers in Juveniles of Gilthead Sea Bream () With Differences in Growth Performance.</a></h1><p>Sirtuins (SIRTs) represent a conserved protein family of deacetylases that act as master regulators of metabolism, but little is known about their roles in fish and livestock animals in general. The present study aimed to assess the value of SIRTs for the metabolic phenotyping of fish by assessing their co-expression with a wide-representation of markers of energy and lipid metabolism and intestinal function and health in two genetically different gilthead sea bream strains with differences in growth performance. Fish from the fast-growing strain exhibited higher feed intake, feed efficiency and plasma IGF-I levels, along with higher hepatosomatic index and lower mesenteric fat (lean phenotype). These observations suggest differences in tissue energy partitioning with an increased flux of fatty  from adipose tissue toward the liver. The resulting increased risk of hepatic steatosis may be counteracted in the liver by reduced lipogenesis and enhanced triglyceride catabolism, in combination with a higher and more efficient oxidative metabolism in white skeletal muscle. These effects were supported by co-regulated changes in the expression profile of SIRTs (liver,  skeletal muscle,  adipose tissue, ) and markers of oxidative metabolism (α), mitochondrial respiration uncoupling () and fatty  and triglyceride metabolism (αγ) that were specific to each strain and tissue. The anterior intestine of the fast-growing strain was better suited to cope with improved growth by increased expression of markers of nutrient absorption (), epithelial   () and immunity (β, ), which were correlated with low expression levels of  and markers of fatty  oxidation (). In the posterior intestine, the fast-growing strain showed a consistent up-regulation of  and  concurrently with increased expression levels of markers of cell proliferation (), oxidative metabolism () and immunity (). Together, these findings indicate that SIRTs may play different roles in the regulation of metabolism, inflammatory tone and growth in farmed fish, arising as powerful biomarkers for a reliable metabolic phenotyping of fish at the tissue-specific level.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31321013> GG attenuates tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-induced bone loss in male mice  gut-microbiota-dependent anti-inflammation.</a></h1><p>Although antiretroviral agents trigger bone loss in human immunodeficiency virus patients, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) induces more severe bone damage, such as osteoporosis. While, the mechanisms are unclear, probiotic supplements may be effective against osteoporosis.C57BL6/J mice were administered with  GG (LGG)+TDF, TDF, and zoledronic +TDF, respectively. Bone morphometry and biomechanics were evaluated using microcomputed tomography, bone slicing, and flexural tests. The lymphocyte, proinflammatory cytokines, and intestinal permeability levels were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and flow cytometry. The gut microbiota composition and metabolomics were analyzed using 16S recombinant deoxyribonucleic  pyrosequencing and ultra-performance liquid-chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.LGG administered orally induced marked increases in trabecular bone microarchitecture, cortical bone volume, and biomechanical properties in the LGG+TDF group compared with that in the TDF-only group. Moreover, LGG treatment increased intestinal  , expanded regulatory T cells, decreased Th17 cells, and downregulated osteoclastogenesis-related cytokines in the bone marrow, spleen, and gut. Furthermore, LGG reconstructed the gut microbiota and changed the metabolite composition, especially lysophosphatidylcholine levels. However, the amount of N-acetyl-leukotriene E4 was the highest in the TDF-only group.LGG reconstructed the community structure of the gut microbiota, promoted the expression of lysophosphatidylcholines, and improved intestinal  to suppress the TDF-induced inflammatory response, which resulted in attenuation of TDF-induced bone loss in mice.

This study investigated the effects of CYP on the intestinal microbiota and gut defence  of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). Different groups of experimental fish were fed a normal control diet (NC), a low CYP diet (LYP) and a high CYP diet (HYP) for 8 weeks. After the feeding trial, the fish were assessed for intestinal enzyme activity, intestinal histology, immune-related gene expression, intestinal SCFAs and intestinal microbiota. Our results indicated that the intestinal  and antioxidant enzyme (CAT and SOD) activity in the common carp were enhanced following CYP supplementation. The mRNA levels of anti-inflammatory (TGF-β), tight binding protein (occludin and ZO-1) and pathway factor genes (TLR4 and NF-κB) were significantly upregulated in the HYP group (P＜0.05), which was accompanied by an increase in the level of pro-inflammatory IL-1β in the gut (P＜0.05). High-throughput sequencing revealed that Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes bacteria were most abundant in the microbial community in the gut of the common carp. The relative abundances of Bacteroides, Flavobacterium and Lactobacillus were increased, while the abundances of pathogenic microorganisms such as Enterobacteriaceae, Shewanella, Pseudomonas and Vibrio were reduced after treatment with CYP. Furthermore, the concentrations of acetic , propionic , butyric  and total short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) in the gut were also increased (P＜0.05). Finally, our results revealed correlations between gut microbiota, SCFAs, non-specific immunity and antioxidant enzymes in CYP-fed carp. These results suggest that CYP-supplemented feed could improve the immunity of the common carp by modulating the intestinal microflora and enhancing the gut defence  and has the potential to be used as an immunostimulating feed additive in aquaculture.Copyright © 2019.

It remained largely unknown how antibiotic-induced dysbiosis confers the risk for enhanced inflammatory response. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that SCFAs, their receptors and transporters mediate the antibiotic long-term effects on the functional state of colonic mucosa and susceptibility to the experimental colitis. Male Wistar rats were treated daily for 14 days with antibiotic ceftriaxone (300 mg/kg, i.m.) or vehicle; euthanized by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation in 1, 14 or 56 days after antibiotic withdrawal. We found increased cecum weight and sustained changes in microbiota composition after ceftriaxone treatment with increased number of conditionally pathogenic enterobacteria, E. coli, Clostridium, Staphylococcus spp. and hemolytic bacteria even at 56 days after antibiotic withdrawal. The concentration of SCFAs was decreased after ceftriaxone withdrawal. We found decreased immunoreactivity of the FFA2, FFA3 receptors, SMCT1 and increased MCT1 & MCT4 transporters of SCFAs in colon mucosa. These changes evoked a significant shift in colonic mucosal homeostasis: the disturbance of oxidant-antioxidant balance; activation of redox-sensitive transcription factor HIF1α and ERK1/2 MAP kinase; increased colonic epithelial permeability and bacterial translocation to blood; morphological remodeling of the colonic tissue. Ceftriaxone pretreatment significantly reinforced inflammation during experimental colitis 56 days after ceftriaxone withdrawal, which was confirmed by increased histopathology of colitis, Goblet cell dysfunction, colonic dilatation and wall thickening, and increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-10). Since the recognition of the importance of microbiota metabolic activity rather than their composition in the development of inflammatory disorders, e.g. IBD, the present study is the first report on the role of the SCFA system in the long lasting side effects of antibiotic treatment and its implication in IBD development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30210332>Hydrogen Sulfide Ameliorates Blood-Spinal Cord  Disruption and Improves Functional Recovery by Inhibiting Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Dependent Autophagy.</a></h1><p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) induces the disruption of blood-spinal cord  (BSCB), which elicits neurological deficits by triggering secondary injuries. Hydrogen sulfide (HS) is a gaseous mediator that has been reported to have neuroprotective effect in the central nervous system. However, the relationship between HS and BSCB disruption during SCI remains unknown. Therefore, it is interesting to evaluate whether the administration of NaHS, a HS donor, can protect BSCB  against SCI and investigate the potential mechanisms underlying it. In present study, we found that SCI markedly activated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy in a rat model of complete crushing injury to the spinal cord at T9 level. NaHS treatment prevented the loss of tight junction (TJ) and adherens junction (AJ) proteins both  and . However, the protective effect of NaHS on BSCB restoration was significantly reduced by an ER stress activator (tunicamycin, TM) and an autophagy activator (rapamycin, Rapa). Moreover, SCI-induced autophagy was remarkably blocked by the ER stress inhibitor (4-phenylbutyric , 4-PBA). But the autophagy inhibitor (3-Methyladenine, 3-MA) only inhibited autophagy without obvious effects on ER stress. Finally, we had revealed that NaHS significantly alleviated BSCB permeability and improved functional recovery after SCI, and these effects were markedly reversed by TM and Rapa. In conclusion, our present study has demonstrated that NaHS treatment is beneficial for SCI recovery, indicating that HS treatment is a potential therapeutic strategy for promoting SCI recovery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680990>Dysbiosis-Associated Enteric Glial Cell Immune-Activation and Redox Imbalance Modulate Tight Junction Protein Expression in Gulf War Illness Pathology.</a></h1><p>About 14% of veterans who suffer from Gulf war illness (GWI) complain of some form of gastrointestinal disorder but with no significant markers of clinical pathology. Our previous studies have shown that exposure to GW chemicals resulted in altered microbiome which was associated with damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release followed by neuro and gastrointestinal inflammation with loss of gut  . Enteric glial cells (EGC) are emerging as important regulators of the gastrointestinal tract and have been observed to change to a reactive phenotype in several functional gastrointestinal disorders such as IBS and IBD. This study is aimed at investigating the role of dysbiosis associated EGC immune-activation and redox instability in contributing to observed gastrointestinal   loss in GWI via altered tight junction protein expression. Using a mouse model of GWI and  studies with cultured EGC and use of antibiotics to ensure gut decontamination we show that exposure to GW chemicals caused dysbiosis associated change in EGCs. EGCs changed to a reactive phenotype characterized by activation of TLR4-S100β/RAGE-iNOS pathway causing release of nitric oxide and activation of NOX2 since gut sterility with antibiotics prevented this change. The resulting peroxynitrite generation led to increased oxidative stress that triggered inflammation as shown by increased NLRP-3 inflammasome activation and increased cell death. Activated EGCs  and  were associated with decrease in tight junction protein occludin and selective water channel aquaporin-3 with a concomitant increase in Claudin-2. The tight junction protein levels were restored following a parallel treatment of GWI mice with a TLR4 inhibitor SsnB and butyric  that are known to decrease the immunoactivation of EGCs. Our study demonstrates that immune-redox mechanisms in EGC are important players in the pathology in GWI and may be possible therapeutic targets for improving outcomes in GWI symptom persistence.Copyright © 2019 Kimono, Sarkar, Albadrani, Seth, Bose, Mondal, Li, Kar, Nagarkatti, Nagarkatti, Sullivan, Janulewicz, Lasley, Horner, Klimas and Chatterjee.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29988553>Aquaporin-4 Autoantibodies From Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder Patients Induce Complement-Independent Immunopathologies in Mice.</a></h1><p>Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are central nervous system inflammatory disorders causing significant morbidities and mortality. The majority of NMOSD patients have autoimmunity against aquaporin-4 (AQP4), evidenced by seropositivity for autoantibodies against aquaporin-4 (AQP4-IgG). AQP4-IgG is pathogenic with neuroinflammation initiated upon binding of AQP4-IgG to astrocytic AQP4. Complement activation contributes to astrocytic cytotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and tissue necrosis in NMOSD, but the role of complement-independent mechanisms is uncertain. We studied the complement-independent pathogenic effects of AQP4-IgG by passive transfer of IgG from NMOSD patients to mice with breached blood-brain  (BBB). Mice, pretreated with bacterial proteins, received daily intraperitoneal injections of IgG purified from AQP4-IgG-seropositive NMOSD patients [IgG], or IgG from AQP4-IgG-seronegative patients [IgG] or healthy subjects [IgG] for 8 days. Motor function was tested by walking across narrow beams, and spinal cords were collected for immunofluorescent analysis. We found that human IgG infiltrated into cord parenchyma of mice with breached BBB without deposition of complement activation products. Spinal cord of mice that received IgG demonstrated loss of AQP4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (suggestive of astrocyte loss), decrease in excitatory amino  transporter 2, microglial/macrophage activation, neutrophil infiltration, patchy demyelination, and loss in axonal . Mice that received IgG required longer time with more paw slips to walk across narrow beams indicative of motor slowing and incoordination. Our findings suggest that AQP4-IgG induces complement-independent cord pathologies, including astrocytopathy, neuroinflammation, demyelination, and axonal injuries/loss, which are associated with subtle motor impairments. These complement-independent pathophysiologies likely contribute to early NMOSD lesion development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30352713>Kojyl cinnamate esters are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α/γ dual agonists.</a></h1><p>Adiponectin is an adipocytokine with insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherosclerotic, and anti-aging properties. Compounds with the ability to promote adiponectin secretion are of interest for the development of anti-aging drugs to improve skin-aging phenotypes. In the phenotypic assay to measure adiponectin secretion during adipogenesis in human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAT-MSCs), kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives increased adiponectin secretion. A target identification study showed that the kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives competitively bound to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α/γ (PPARα/γ). The upregulation of adiponectin production induced by kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives was significantly correlated with PPARα and PPARγ binding activities. Kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives significantly increased the transcription of genes encoding cholesterol and fatty  synthesizing enzymes in hAT-MSCs. Notably, the kojyl cinnamate esters upregulated the gene transcription of lipid metabolic enzymes in human epidermal keratinocytes, which are important in the  of skin permeability . In addition, the kojyl cinnamate esters that function as PPARα/γ dual modulators inhibited ultraviolet B irradiation-induced inflammation in human epidermal keratinocytes. Therefore, kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives are a novel class of PPARα/γ dual agonists with the potential to improve skin-aging phenotypes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we demonstrate a single-step, waterborne approach to prepare additive-free flame-retardant and self-extinguishing, mechanical high-performance nanopapers based purely on surface-deacetylated chitin nanofibrils (ChNFs). We show that the flammability can be critically reduced by exchanging the counterions, e.g. to the phosphate type, using the respective  providing electrostatic stabilization in the preparation of the ChNFs. This exchange renders beneficial elemental combinations of high contents of N/P (nitrogen/phosphorus) in the final nanopapers, known to provide outstanding performance in halogen- and heavy metal-free flame-retardant materials. Full fire  nanopapers can even be obtained by hybridizing the ChNF with nanoclay. Comprehensive fire retardancy tests, including vertical and horizontal flame tests and microscale cone combustion calorimetry, as well as fire breakthrough tests elucidate excellent flame-retardant properties and high structural  when being burned.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a multistrain probiotic on cognitive function, risk of falls, and inflammatory response in patients with cirrhosis. Consecutive outpatients with cirrhosis and cognitive dysfunction (defined by a Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score [PHES] < -4) and/or falls in the previous year were randomized to receive either a sachet of a high-concentration multistrain probiotic containing 450 billion bacteria twice daily for 12 weeks or placebo.

We showed that carnosol pretreatment suppressed tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)-induced cell viability, affected the production of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increased the produce of nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, carnosol promotes the protein expression of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) to keep the  of intercellular junctions, which indicated that it protected microvascular  in oxidative stress. Meanwhile, we investigated that carnosol can interrupt Nrf2-Keap1 protein-protein interaction and stimulated antioxidant-responsive element (ARE)-driven luciferase activity in vitro. Mechanistically, we showed that carnosol promotes the expression of heme oxygenase 1(HO-1) and nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2(Nrf2). It can also promote the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).

G-protein coupled receptor (GPR) 40 has been identified as a receptor of polyunsaturated fatty . This study aimed to investigate the function of GPR40 in regulating tight junction assembly in human airway epithelial cells (Calu-3 cells) using GW9508, a GPR40 agonist. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analyses showed that Calu-3 cells expressed both types of polyunsaturated fatty  receptors including GPR40 and GPR120. Intracellular Ca measurements confirmed that GW9508 stimulated GPR40, but not GPR120. In Ca switch assays, GW9508 promoted the recovery of transepithelial electrical resistance and re-localization of zonula occludens (ZO)-1 to intercellular areas. These effects were suppressed by inhibitors of GPR40 and phospholipase C (PLC). Interestingly, GW9508 enhanced tight junction assembly in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner. The effect of GW9508 on inducing tight junction assembly was also confirmed in 16HBE14o- cells. Our results indicate that GPR40 stimulation by GW9508 leads to AMPK activation via calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ). Collectively, this study reveals an unprecedented role of GPR40 in facilitating airway epithelial tight junction assembly via PLC-CaMKKβ-AMPK pathways. GPR40 represents a novel regulator of airway epithelial  and its stimulation may be beneficial in the treatment of airway diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399314>Retinoic  promotes  functions in human iPSC-derived intestinal epithelial monolayers.</a></h1><p>Vitamin A (VA) is a fat-soluble micronutrient that plays essential roles in various biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. In the intestine, VA are known to promote mucosal homeostasis and immunity. However, the effect of VA in intestinal development has not been well elucidated. In the present study, we generated human intestine organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and investigated the effect of the VA active metabolite all-trans retinoic  (RA), on differentiation into intestinal organoids. As a result, RA increased the gene expression of a drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4, as a functional molecule of intestinal mature development, in iPSC-derived intestinal organoids. In addition, RA increased transepithelial electrical resistance, an indicator of epithelial , and decreased the permeability of monolayers to fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran in intestinal epithelial monolayers. Finally, RA increased the expression of ZO-1, a marker of tight junctions, which are essential for intestinal epithelial  function. Taken together, these results indicate that RA promotes  functions of iPSC-derived intestinal epithelial monolayers by increasing ZO-1 expression.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide, and reactive nitrogen species, such as nitric oxide and peroxynitrite, play essential roles in normal brain capillary endothelial cell functioning; however, chronically elevated oxidative and nitrosative stress can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and damage to the blood-brain . Activated microglia, redox control of which is mediated by nitric oxide synthases and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases, secrete neurotoxic molecules such as reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, prostaglandin, cyclooxygenase-2, quinolinic , several chemokines (including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1], C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 [CXCL-1] and macrophage inflammatory protein 1α [MIP-1α]) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, which can exert a detrimental effect on blood-brain   and function. Similarly, reactive astrocytes produce neurotoxic molecules such as prostaglandin E2 and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can cause a 'leaky brain'.Chronic inflammatory and oxidative and nitrosative stress is associated with the development of a 'leaky gut'. The following evidence-based approaches, which address the leaky gut and blood-brain  dysfunction, are suggested as potential therapeutic interventions for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders: melatonin, statins, probiotics containing Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, N-acetylcysteine, and prebiotics containing fructo-oligosaccharides and galacto-oligosaccharides.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29920917>Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG increases cyclooxygenase-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 secretion in colonic myofibroblasts via a MyD88-dependent mechanism during homeostasis.</a></h1><p>Prostaglandin E2 (PGE ) plays a critical role in intestinal mucosal tolerance and  . Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-dependent PGE production involves mobilisation of arachidonic . Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LbGG) is one of the most widely used probiotics reported to colonise the colonic mucosa. LbGG contributes to the protection of the small intestine against radiation injury through the repositioning of mucosal COX-2 expressing cells. However, it is unknown if LbGG modulates PGE production in the colonic mucosa under homeostasis and the major cellular elements involved in these processes. Colonic epithelial and CD90 mesenchymal stromal cells, also known as (myo) fibroblasts (CMFs), are abundant innate immune cells in normal colonic mucosa able to produce PGE . Herein, we tested the hypothesis that under colonic mucosal homeostasis, LbGG modulates the eicosanoid pathway resulting in increased PGE production in both epithelial and stromal cells. Among the five tested human colonic epithelial cell lines, only exposure of Caco-2 to LbGG for 24 hr led to the mobilisation of arachidonic  with concomitant increase in the components within the leukotriene and COX-2-dependent PGE pathways. By contrast, CMFs isolated from the normal human colonic mucosa responded to LbGG with increased expression of COX-2 and PGE in the prostaglandin pathway, but not 5-LO in the leukotriene pathway. Oral gavage of C57BL/6 mice for 5 days with LbGG (5 × 10 Colony-Forming Unit (CFU)/dose) increased COX-2 expression in the colonic mucosa. The majority of cells upregulating COX-2 protein expression were located in the colonic lamina propria and colocalised with α-SMA cells corresponding to the CMF phenotype. This process was myeloid differentiation factor-88-dependent, because silencing of myeloid differentiation factor-88 expression in CMFs abrogated LbGG-induced upregulation of COX-2 in culture and in vivo. Taken together, our data suggest that LbGG increases release of COX-2-mediated PGE , contributing to the maintenance of mucosal homeostasis in the colon and CMFs are among the major contributors to this process.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30236608>Inhibition of Aeromonas hydrophila-induced intestinal inflammation and mucosal  function damage in crucian carp by oral administration of Lactococcus lactis.</a></h1><p>This study explored the immunomodulatory effect and inhibition effects of the candidate probiotic Lactococcus lactis 16-7, which was isolated from crucian carp, on Aeromonas hydrophila infection in crucian carp. The experimental fish were divided into two groups; one was fed a diet supplemented with L. lactis, while the other was fed the control probiotic-free diet. After feeding for 42 d with the experimental diets, the fish that received the diet supplemented with probiotics exhibited a significantly enhanced serum superoxide dismutase activity, phagocytic activities of innate immune cells, and the expression levels of immune-related genes [interferon-γ (INF-γ), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-11 (IL-11), tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)], indicating that L. lactis 16-7 could activate the non-specific immune system of crucian carp. At the end of the feeding trial, the crucian carps in each group were orally infected with A. hydrophila NJ-35. The results show that L. lactis 16-7 could prevent the increase in d-lactic  concentration and inflammatory response caused by A. hydrophila in crucian carp. Compared with A. hydrophila group, L. lactis 16-7 preserved the  of intestinal villi and mitigated A. hydrophila-induced reduce in the transcriptional levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin, indicating that L. lactis 16-7 could reduce intestinal mucosal  damage and inflammation induced by A. hydrophila in crucian carp. In addition, L. lactis 16-7 could effectively antagonize the colonization of A. hydrophila in the intestine. Overall, these data clearly indicate that L. lactis 16-7 has the potential to be developed as a probiotic agent against A. hydrophila infection in aquaculture.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Ongoing research suggests that these aberrations may be contributing to heightened immune signals that have the potential to disrupt neuronal homeostasis and exacerbate behavioural deficits. The current study aimed to determine whether the well-characterized animal model of neuropsychopathology, the maternal immune activation (MIA) model, produced GI inflammation and  disruptions in association with anxiety-like behaviour.Pregnant Wistar rats were exposed to the viral mimetic polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidilic  (polyI:C) on gestational days (GD) 10 and 19. Evidence of ANS activation, GI inflammation, and GI   was assessed in both neonatal (postnatal day, P7) and adult (P84) offspring. Anxiety-like behaviour was assessed at P100.Neonatal MIA offspring exhibited an altered intestinal inflammatory profile and evidence of an increase in lymphoid aggregates. MIA neonates also displayed disruptions to GI  tight junction protein mRNA. In addition, adult MIA offspring exhibited an increase in anxiety-like behaviours.These results indicate that the MIA rat model, which is well documented to produce behavioural, neurochemical, and neuroanatomical abnormalities, also produces GI inflammation and  disruptions. We suggest that this model may be a useful tool to elucidate biological pathways associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.© 2018 S.

There is limited clinical experience concerning pediatric NAFLD patients, and thus the therapeutic options are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefits of exercise on gut microbiota composition and functionality balance, and consequent effects on early obesity and NAFLD onset in an  model. Juvenile (21-day-old) male Wistar rats fed a control diet or a high-fat diet (HFD) were subjected to a combined aerobic and resistance training protocol. Fecal microbiota was sequenced by an Illumina MiSeq system, and parameters related to metabolic syndrome, fecal metabolome, intestinal  , bile  metabolism and transport, and alteration of the gut-liver axis were measured. Exercise decreased HFD-induced body weight gain, metabolic syndrome and hepatic steatosis, as a result of its lipid metabolism modulatory capacity. Gut microbiota composition and functionality were substantially modified as a consequence of diet, age and exercise intervention. In addition, the training protocol increased ,  and  genera, correlating with a beneficial metabolomic profile, whereas ,  and  showed an opposite pattern. Exercise effectively counteracted HFD-induced microbial imbalance, leading to intestinal  preservation, which, in turn, prevented deregulation of the gut-liver axis and improved bile  homeostasis, determining the clinical outcomes of NAFLD. In conclusion, we provide scientific evidence highlighting the benefits of gut microbiota composition and functionality modulation by physical exercise protocols in the management of early obesity and NAFLD development.© 2019.

Emerging evidence supports the role of gut microbiota in mediating the interaction between the host and environment by extracting energy from food otherwise indigestible by the host and producing metabolites and cytokines that affect host metabolism. Furthermore, gut microbial imbalance or dysbiosis has been shown in metabolic diseases including obesity, and recent studies are beginning to unravel the mechanisms involved. The gut microbiota affects host metabolism and obesity through several pathways involving gut  , production of metabolites affecting satiety and insulin resistance, epigenetic factors, and metabolism of bile  and subsequent changes in metabolic signaling. While the field of gut microbiome and its role in obesity is early in its stage of development, it holds a promising future in providing us with novel therapeutic targets that may restore the gut microbiome to a healthy state and help in the prevention and treatment of obesity.© 2019 New York Academy of Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081119>High-fat diet intake modulates maternal intestinal adaptations to pregnancy and results in placental hypoxia, as well as altered fetal gut  proteins and immune markers.</a></h1><p>Maternal obesity has been associated with shifts in intestinal microbiota, which may contribute to impaired  function Impaired  function may expose the placenta and fetus to pro-inflammatory mediators We investigated the impacts of diet-induced obesity in mice on maternal and fetal intestinal structure and placental vascularization Diet-induced obesity decreased maternal intestinal short chain fatty  and their receptors, impaired gut   and was associated with fetal intestinal inflammation. Placenta from obese mothers showed blood vessel immaturity, hypoxia, increased transcript levels of inflammation, autophagy and altered levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers. These data suggest that maternal intestinal changes probably contribute to adverse placental adaptations and also impart an increased risk of obesity in the offspring via alterations in fetal gut development.Shifts in maternal intestinal microbiota have been implicated in metabolic adaptations to pregnancy. In the present study, we generated cohorts of female C57BL/6J mice fed a control (17% kcal fat, n = 10-14) or a high-fat diet (HFD 60% kcal from fat, n = 10-14; ad libitum) aiming to investigate the impact on the maternal gut microbiota, intestinal inflammation and gut  , placental inflammation and fetal intestinal development at embryonic day 18.5. HFD was associated with decreased relative abundances of short-chain fatty  (SCFA) producing genera during pregnancy. These diet-induced shifts paralleled decreased maternal intestinal mRNA levels of SCFA receptor Gpr41, modestly decreased cecal butyrate, and altered mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines and immune cell markers in the maternal intestine. Maternal HFD resulted in impaired gut  , with corresponding increases in circulating maternal levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumour necrosis factor. Placentas from HFD dams demonstrated blood vessel immaturity and hypoxia; decreased free carnitine, acylcarnitine derivatives and trimethylamine-N-oxide; and altered mRNA levels of inflammation, autophagy, and ER stress markers. HFD exposed fetuses had increased activation of nuclear factor-kappa B and inhibition of the unfolded protein response in the developing intestine. Taken together, these data suggest that HFD intake prior to and during pregnancy shifts the composition of the maternal gut microbiota and impairs gut  , resulting in increased maternal circulating LPS, which may ultimate contribute to changes in placental vascularization and fetal gut development.© 2019 The Authors.

Beyond a pure  separating the inner space of the cell from the outer, the plasma membrane is a scaffold and player in cell-to-cell communication and the initiation of intracellular signals among other functions. Critical to this function is the plasma membrane compartmentalization in lipid microdomains that control the localization and productive interactions of proteins involved in cell signal propagation. In addition, cells are divided into compartments limited by other membranes whose  and homeostasis are finely controlled, and which determine the identity and function of the different organelles. Here, we review current knowledge on membrane lipid composition in the plasma membrane and endomembrane compartments, emphasizing its role in sustaining organelle structure and function. The correct composition and structure of cell membranes define key pathophysiological aspects of cells.

Previously, we have reported the skin anti-aging effects of  HY7714 (HY7714) in a clinical trial. To prove the protective skin effects of HY7714 through the intestinal tight junction (TJ), we investigated the effects of HY7714 on the intestines through tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α induced TJ defects in Caco-2 cells. Specifically, 24 h treatment with HY7714 restored the decreased expression of zonula occludens-1, occludin, and claudin-1 compared to the TNF-α-treated groups (<0.05). It also attenuated the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6, 8, and 1β. Further, increases in the mRNA levels of Elk-1, nuclear factor-κB, and myosin light chain kinase expression induced by TNF-α were recovered by HY7714. These findings imply that HY7714 improves intestinal   and is a potential therapeutic agent for dysfunctions derived from TJ defects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31005999>Dietary mannan oligosaccharide ameliorates cyclic heat stress-induced damages on intestinal oxidative status and   of broilers.</a></h1><p>This study investigated protective effects of mannan oligosaccharide (MOS) inclusion on growth performance, intestinal oxidative status, and   of cyclic heat-stressed broilers. A total of 240 one-day-old chicks were allocated into 3 treatments of 10 replicates each. Control broilers reared at a thermoneutral temperature were fed a basal diet, whereas broilers in heat stress and MOS groups raised at a cyclic high temperature (32 to 33°C for 8 h/d) were given the basal diet supplemented with 0 or 250 mg/kg MOS, respectively. Compared with control group, heat stress decreased (P < 0.05) average daily gain and feed conversion ratio during grower, finisher, and entire periods, average daily feed intake during finisher and entire periods, and ileal superoxide dismutase activity at 42 D, whereas increased (P < 0.05) rectal temperature at 21 and 42 D and jejunal malondialdehyde content at 42 D. Dietary MOS increased (P < 0.05) average daily gain, average daily feed intake, and feed conversion ratio during finisher and entire periods, but decreased (P < 0.05) jejunal malondialdehyde concentration of heat-stressed broilers at 42 D. Heat stress decreased (P < 0.05) jejunal villus height (VH) and claudin-3 gene expression at 21 D, and VH and VH: crypt depth (CD) ratio in jejunum and ileum as well as mRNA abundances of jejunal mucin 2 and occludin, and ileal mucin 2, zonula occludens-1, and occludin, and claudin-3 at 42 D, whereas increased (P < 0.05) serum D-lactate  content at 21 and 42 D, and serum diamine oxidase activity and jejunal CD at 42 D. The MOS supplementation increased (P < 0.05) jejunal VH at 21 D, VH and VH: CD of jejunum and ileum at 42 D, mRNA abundances of jejunal occludin and ileal mucin 2, zonula occludens-1, and occludin at 42 D, whereas reduced (P < 0.05) ileal CD at 42 D.

Previous studies demonstrated that deletion of SurA renders bacteria more sensitive to toxins that compromise the  of the outer membrane. Inhibitors of SurA will perturb the folding of OMPs, leading to disruption of the outer membrane  and making the cell more vulnerable to toxic insults.

Our laboratory has screened over 10,000,000 compoundsin silicoby computationally docking these compounds onto the crystal structure of SurA. Through this screen and a screen of fragment compounds (molecular weight less than 250 g/mol), we found twelve commercially readily available candidate compounds that bind to the putative client binding site of SurA. We confirmed binding to SurA by developing and employing a competitive fluorescence anisotropy-based binding assay. Our results show that one of these compounds, Fmoc-β-(2-quinolyl)-d-alanine, binds the client binding site with high micromolar affinity. Using this compound as a lead, we also discovered that Fmoc-l-tryptophan and Fmoc-l-phenylalanine, but not Fmoc-l-tyrosine, bind SurA with similar micromolar affinity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a competitive fluorescence anisotropy assay developed for the identification of inhibitors of the chaperone SurA, and the identification of three small molecules that bind SurA at its client binding site.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The transcription factor Grainyhead-like 3 (GRHL3) is essential for maintaining   and preventing development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC); however, how loss of this factor, which in the skin is expressed exclusively within suprabasal epidermal layers triggers proliferation of basal keratinocytes, had thus far remained elusive. Our present study identifies thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) as a novel soluble chemokine mediator of keratinocyte proliferation following loss of GRHL3. Knockdown of GRHL3 in human keratinocytes showed that of 42 cytokines examined, TARC was the only significantly upregulated chemokine. Mouse skin lacking Grhl3 presented an inflammatory response with hallmarks of TARC activation, including heightened induction of blood clotting, increased infiltration of mast cells and pro-inflammatory T cells, increased expression of the pro-proliferative/pro-inflammatory markers CD3 and pSTAT3, and significantly elevated basal keratinocyte proliferation. Treatment of skin cultures lacking Grhl3 with the broad spectrum anti-inflammatory 5-aminosalicylic  (5ASA) partially restored epidermal differentiation, indicating that abnormal keratinocyte proliferation/differentiation balance is a key driver of  dysfunction following loss of Grhl3, and providing a promising therapeutic avenue in the treatment of GRHL3-mediated epidermal disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31170451>Retinoic : A potential therapeutic agent for cryptorchidism infertility based on investigation of flutamide-induced cryptorchid rats in vivo and in vitro.</a></h1><p>Cryptorchidism is a common disorder in children and may cause infertility in adults. The BTB is essential for maintaining the microenvironment necessary for normal spermatogenesis. This study investigated whether retinoic  (RA) may regulate the proteins that are essential for integrity of the BTB in cryptorchidism. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were administrated flutamide during late pregnancy to induce a model of cryptorchidism in male offspring. The concentrations of RA and BTB tight and gap junction protein levels were significantly lower in untreated cryptorchid pups compared with normal pups, but almost normal in cryptorchid pups given RA. Studies in vitro corroborated these findings. The sperm quality of RA-treated model pups was better compared with the untreated model.

Proper epithelial function mainly depends on tight junctions (TJs), which act as both ion channels and a  against noxious molecules. TJs are multiprotein complexes consisting of transmembrane and membrane-associated proteins. Because the intestine in piglets is immature and incomplete, its structure and function are easily impaired by various stresses, infections, and food-related factors. Certain nutrients have been demonstrated to participate in intestinal TJ regulation. Probiotics, amino , fibers, oligosaccharide, and certain micronutrients can enhance   and counteract infections through elevated TJ protein expression and distribution.

This study was undertaken to investigate whether a 2,2'-bipyridine containing natural product, collismycins C, can modulate PolyP-mediated inflammatory responses in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and in mice. After HUVECs or mice were activated with PolyP, cells or mice were post-treated with collismycins C. The anti-inflammatory activities of collismycins C were determined by measuring permeability, leukocytes adhesion and migration, and activation of pro-inflammatory proteins in PolyP-activated HUVECs and mice. In addition, the beneficial effects of collismycins C on survival rate in PolyP-injected mice. Collismycins C inhibits PolyP-mediated  disruption, the expressions of cell adhesion molecules, and leukocyte to HUVEC adhesion/migration. Interestingly, PolyP-induced NF-κB activation and the productions of TNF-α and IL-6 were inhibited by collismycins C in HUVECs. These anti-inflammatory functions of collismycins C were confirmed in PolyP injected mice. In conclusion, based on the anti-inflammatory effects of collismycins C in PolyP-mediated septic response, collismycins C have therapeutic potential for various systemic inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2019.

The microbiota ensures the  of the gut  through multiple mechanisms, either by releasing antibacterial molecules (bacteriocins) and anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty  or by activating essential cell receptors for the immune response. Experimental studies have confirmed the role of the intestinal microbiota in the epigenetic modulation of the gut  through posttranslational histone modifications and regulatory mechanisms induced by epithelial miRNA in the epithelial lumen. Any quantitative or functional changes of the intestinal microbiota, referred to as dysbiosis, alter the immune response, decrease epithelial permeability and destabilize intestinal homeostasis. Consequently, the overgrowth of pathobionts (, and Escherichia ) favors intestinal translocations with Gram negative bacteria or their endotoxins and could trigger sepsis, septic shock, secondary peritonitis, or various intestinal infections. Intestinal infections also induce epithelial lesions and perpetuate the risk of bacterial translocation and dysbiosis through epithelial ischemia and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, the decline of protective anaerobic bacteria ( and ) and inadequate release of immune modulators (such as butyrate) affects the release of antimicrobial peptides, de-represses microbial virulence factors and alters the innate immune response. As a result, intestinal germs modulate liver pathology and represent a common etiology of infections in HIV immunosuppressed patients. Antibiotic and antiretroviral treatments also promote intestinal dysbiosis, followed by the selection of resistant germs which could later become a source of infections. The current article addresses the strong correlations between the intestinal  and the microbiota and discusses the role of dysbiosis in destabilizing the intestinal  and promoting infectious diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30270529>Lactic and lactobionic  as typically moisturizing compounds.</a></h1><p>Recently more attention has been drawn to alpha hydroxy and polyhydroxy  (AHA and PHA) due to their excellent moisturizing and antioxidant properties.

We evaluated the usefulness of three inflammatory and gut-wall- biomarkers to assess the degree of intestinal histo-morphological damage in piglets. Piglets were orally challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) to get a variable range of response according to individual variability. Forty-eight piglets were challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium and seventy-two with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli K88. Clinical signs and faecal score were recorded. At Days 4 and 8 post-inoculation, blood was sampled, animals euthanised and distal ileum dissected. Morphological measures were obtained from the gut tissue, and serum tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), pig major acute-phase protein (Pig-MAP) and intestinal fatty -binding protein (I-FABP) were determined. Animals developed mild-to-severe diarrhoea after the challenge. When analysing the complete set of analytical results, a high correlation was found among the three serum biomarkers. The most representative morphological indicator was the villus:crypt ratio (V:C), which showed a strong negative correlation with all three biomarkers. Regression analyses between faecal score and the previous variable showed linear relations. When the range of V:C was analysed, based on the quartile distribution of each serum variable, a marked increase in their concentration was observed with greater villus damage.

In this Series paper, we propose that age-associated changes in gut commensal microbes, otherwise known as the microbiota, facilitate cancer development and growth by compromising immune fitness. Ageing is associated with a reduction in the beneficial commensal microbes, which control the expansion of pathogenic commensals and maintain the  of the intestinal  through the production of mucus and lipid metabolites, such as short-chain fatty . Expansion of gut dysbiosis and leakage of microbial products contributes to the chronic proinflammatory state (inflammaging), which negatively affects the immune system and impairs the removal of mutant and senescent cells, thereby enabling tumour outgrowth. Studies in animal models and the importance of commensals in cancer immunotherapy suggest that this status can be reversible. Thus, interventions that alter the composition of the gut microbiota might reduce inflammaging and rejuvenate immune functions to provide anticancer benefits in frail elderly people.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Indeed, the resident gut bacteria are needed for multiple vital functions, such as nutrient and drug metabolism, the production of energy, defense against pathogens, the modulation of the immune system and support of the integrity of the gut mucosal . The bacteria are collected in communities that vary in density and composition within each segment of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Therefore, every change in the gut ecosystem has been connected to an increased susceptibility or exacerbation of various GI disorders. The aim of this review is to summarize the recently available data on PPI-related microbiota alterations in each segment of the GI tract and to analyze the possible involvement of PPIs in the pathogenesis of several specific GI diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202650>Effect of fermented milk from Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris strain JFR1 on Salmonella invasion of intestinal epithelial cells.</a></h1><p>The process of fermentation contributes to the organoleptic properties, preservation, and nutritional benefits of food. Fermented food may interfere with pathogen infections through a variety of mechanisms, including competitive exclusion or improving intestinal  integrity. In this study, the effect of milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris JFR1 on Salmonella invasion of intestinal epithelial cell cultures was investigated. Epithelial cells (HT29-MTX, Caco-2, and cocultures of the 2) were treated for 1 h with Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris JFR1 fermented milk before infection with Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica Typhimurium. Treatment with fermented milk resulted in increased transepithelial electrical resistance, which remained constant for the duration of infection (up to 3 h), illustrating a protective effect. After gentamicin treatment to remove adhered bacterial cells, enumeration revealed a reduction in numbers of intracellular Salmonella. Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR data indicated a downregulation of Salmonella virulence genes hilA, invA, and sopD after treatment with fermented milk. Fermented milk treatment of epithelial cells also exhibited an immunomodulatory effect reducing the production of proinflammatory IL-8. In contrast, chemically acidified milk (glucono delta-lactone) failed to show the same effect on monolayer integrity, Salmonella Typhimurium invasion, and gene expression as well as immune modulation. Furthermore, an oppA knockout mutant of Salmonella Typhimurium infecting treated epithelial cells did not show suppressed virulence gene expression. Collectively, these results suggest that milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris JFR1 is effective in vitro in the reduction of Salmonella invasion into intestinal epithelial cells. A functional OppA permease in Salmonella is required to obtain the antivirulence effect of fermented milk.The Authors.

Transient lactose intolerance, due to loss of intestinal brush border lactase, also complicates SAM, thus milk based feeds may not be optimal for nutritional rehabilitation. Since the gut epithelial  can be supported by short chain fatty , derived from microbiota fermentation by particular fermentable carbohydrates, we postulated that an energy-dense nutritional feed comprising of legume-based fermentable carbohydrates, incorporated with lactose-free versions of standard World Health Organization (WHO) F75/F100 nutritional feeds will enhance epithelial  function in malnourished children, reduce and promote resolution of diarrhoea and improve overall outcome.  We will investigate in an open-label trial in 160 Ugandan children with SAM, defined by mid-upper arm circumference <11.5cm and/or presence of kwashiorkor. Children will be randomised to a lactose-free, chickpea-enriched feed containing 2 kcal/ml, provided in quantities to match usual energy provision (experimental) or WHO standard treatment F75 (0.75 kcal/ml) and F100 (1 kcal/ml) feeds on a 1:1 basis, conducted at Mbale Regional Referral Hospital nutritional rehabilitation unit. The primary outcomes are change in MUAC at day 90 and survival to day 90. Secondary outcomes include: i) moderate to good weight gain (>5 g/kg/day), ii)  development of diarrhoea (>3 loose stools/day), iii) time to diarrhoea resolution (if >3 loose stools/day), and iv) time to oedema resolution (if kwashiorkor) and change in intestinal biomarkers (faecal calprotectin).  We hypothesize that, if introduced early in the management of malnutrition, such lactose-free, fermentable carbohydrate-based feeds, could safely and cheaply improve global outcome by reducing lactose intolerance-related diarrhoea, improving mucosal  and enhancing immunity, and limiting the risk of systemic infection and associated broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance.

We hypothesize that reduced SCFA levels are associated with systemic inflammation, endotoxemia, and more severe hemodynamic alterations in cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis referred for a hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement ( = 62) or a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement ( = 12) were included. SCFAs were measured in portal (when available), hepatic, and peripheral blood samples by GC-MS. Serum endotoxins, proinflammatory cytokines, and NO levels were quantified. SCFA levels were significantly higher in portal  hepatic and peripheral blood. There were inverse relationships between SCFAs and the severity of disease. SCFAs (mainly butyric ) inversely correlated with the model for end-stage liver disease score and were further reduced in patients with history of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. There was an inverse relationship between butyric  and HVPG values. SCFAs were directly related with systemic vascular resistance and inversely with cardiac index. Butyric  inversely correlated with inflammatory markers and serum endotoxin. A global reduction in the blood levels of SCFA in patients with cirrhosis is associated with a more advanced liver disease, suggesting its contribution to disease progression.-Juanola, O., Ferrusquía-Acosta, J., García-Villalba, R., Zapater, P., Magaz, M., Marín, A., Olivas, P., Baiges, A., Bellot, P., Turon, F., Hernández-Gea, V., González-Navajas, J.

Children experiencing gastroesophageal and extraesophageal reflux are often prescribed proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to reduce gastric  associated damage to esophageal and airway mucosa. The potential of pepsin and gastric fluid, from children that were either on or off PPI therapy, to cause inflammation and damage using a human in vitro co-culture model of the airway mucosa was evaluated herein. Exposure of the airway model to acidic solutions caused cellular damage and loss of viability, however,  alone did not disrupt   or instigate neutrophil trans-epithelial migration without pepsin. Gastric fluid from patients on PPI therapy exhibited only a slightly higher pH yet had significantly higher concentrations of pepsin and elicited more  disruption and neutrophil trans-epithelial migration compared to gastric fluid from patients off PPIs. Inflammatory and damaging responses observed with gastric fluid from patients on PPIs were largely driven by pepsin. These results indicate the potential for PPI usage to raise concentrations of pepsin in gastric fluid, which may enhance the pathological impact of micro-aspirations in children with extraesophageal reflux.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30404545>Safety of sodium hyaluronate eye drop with C12-benzalkonium chloride.</a></h1><p>In this study, we investigated the effects of commercially available multi-dose sodium hyaluronate 0.1% (Hyalein; Santen, Osaka, Japan) containing 0.003% C12-benzalkonium chloride (BAC) on the Corneal epithelium and its degree of safety.Japanese white male rabbits were divided into four groups. The corneas of each group exposed to one of the following solutions: sodium hyaluronate 0.1%, C12-BAC, C12, 14, 16-BAC Mixture, and Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (as control), respectively. Corneal transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) changes after 60 s of exposure to the above solutions were measured in living rabbits. TER reflects the  function of the epithelium. In addition, scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the acute effects of the above solutions on the  of the corneal epithelium of four groups.There was no significant decrease in the corneal TER after exposure of the cornea to Hyalein eye drops as compared to HBSS control eyes. Also, BAC mixture solution and C12-BAC did not produce any significant decrease in the corneal TER as compared to HBSS control eyes. All the corneal epithelium exposed to Hyalein, 0.003% C12-BAC and 0.003% BAC mixture exhibited a regular appearance of the superficial cells with a high density of microvilli.This study confirms that Hyalein has no acute hazardous effect on corneal epithelium.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671075>SDR9C7 catalyzes critical dehydrogenation of acylceramides for skin  formation.</a></h1><p>The corneocyte lipid envelope composed of covalently bound ceramides and fatty  is important to the  of the permeability  in the stratum corneum, and its absence is a prime structural defect in various skin diseases associated with defective skin  function. SDR9C7 encodes a short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 9C member 7 (SDR9C7) recently found mutated in ichthyosis. In a patient with SDR9C7 mutation and a mouse Sdr9c7 knockout model we show loss of covalent binding of epidermal ceramides to protein, a structural fault in the . For reasons unresolved, protein binding requires lipoxygenase-catalyzed transformations of linoleic  (18:2) esterified in ω-O-acylceramides. In Sdr9c7-/- epidermis, quantitative LC-MS assays revealed almost complete loss of a species of ω-O-acylceramide esterified with linoleate-9,10-trans-epoxy-11E-13-ketone; other acylceramides related to the lipoxygenase pathway were in higher abundance. Recombinant SDR9C7 catalyzed NAD+-dependent dehydrogenation of linoleate 9,10-trans-epoxy-11E-13-alcohol to the corresponding 13-ketone, while ichthyosis mutants were inactive. We propose, therefore, that the critical requirement for lipoxygenases and SDR9C7 is in producing acylceramide containing the 9,10-epoxy-11E-13-ketone, a reactive moiety known for its non-enzymatic coupling to protein. This suggests a mechanism for coupling of ceramide to protein and provides important insights into skin  formation and pathogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31402631>Influence of Alkyl Chains of Modified Polysuccinimide-Based Polycationic Polymers on Polyplex Formation and Transfection.</a></h1><p>The development of polymers with low toxicity and efficient gene delivery remains a significant  of nonviral gene therapy. Modification and tuning of chemical structures of carriers is an attractive strategy for efficient nucleic  delivery. Here, polyplexes consisting of plasmid DNA (pDNA) and dodecylated or non-dodecylated polysuccinimide (PSI)-based polycations are designed, and their transfection ability into HeLa cells is investigated by green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing cells quantification. All cationic polymers show lower cytotoxicity than those of branched polyethyleneimine (bPEI). PSI and bPEI-based polyplexes have comparable physicochemical properties such as size and charge. Interestingly, a strong interaction between dodecylated polycations and pDNA caused by the hydrophobic moiety is observed in dodecylated PSI derivatives. Moreover, the decrease of GFP expression is associated with lower dissociation of pDNA from polyplexes according to the heparin displacement assay. Besides, a hydrophobization of PSI cationic derivatives with dodecyl side chains can modulate the  of polyplexes by hydrophobic interactions, increasing the binding between the polymer and the DNA. These results provide useful information for designing polyplexes with lower toxicity and greater stability and transfection performance.© 2019 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Additionally, neuroprotective activities of α-lipoic  (LA) and Ginkgo biloba (GB) were investigated.Forty adults rats were enrolled into; Control, AgNPs (50 mg/kg), LA (100 mg/kg) + AgNPs, and GB (120 mg/kg) + AgNPs. After 30 days, neuronal changes were assessed biochemically and histopathologically. Brain tissues oxidative indices, mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines and tight-junction proteins and pro-apoptotic biomarker, caspase-3 were investigated.AgNPs exposure enhanced lipid peroxidation (+195%) along with declines in glutathione (-43%), glutathione peroxidase (-34%), glutathione S-transferase (-31%), catalase (-43%), and superoxide dismutase (-38%) activities in brain tissues. The apparent brain oxidative damage was associated with obvious neuronal dysfunction that was ascertained by neuropathological lesions. AgNPs lowered serum acetylcholine esterase, iron and copper levels, and increased creatine phosphokinase and creatine phosphokinase-brain type activities. Following AgNPs exposure, brain silver and iron contents were increased, but the copper level was decreased. AgNPs up-regulated TNF-α (6.5-fold) and IL-1β (8.9-fold) transcript levels, and simultaneously over-expressed the caspase-3 protein in cerebrum and cerebellum inducing cell apoptosis. Moreover, AgNPs down-regulated the transcript levels of tight-junction proteins; JP-1 (0.65-fold) and JAM-3(0.81-fold).LA and relatively GB improved the serious effects of AgNPs on the blood-brain  function and tight-junction proteins through their antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic efficacies. Co-treatment with LA or GB may be favorable in ameliorating the neurotoxic side effects of AgNPs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Microbial products, such as the short-chain fatty  butyrate, can have positive effects on wound healing. We used an in vitro model of T84 colonic epithelial cells to determine if the Snail genes Slug () and Snail (), implemented in keratinocyte monolayer healing, are involved in butyrate-enhanced colonic epithelial wound healing. Using shRNA-mediated Slug/Snail knockdown, we found that knockdown of Slug (Slug-KD), but not Snail (Snail-KD), impairs wound healing in scratch assays with and without butyrate. Slug and Snail had differential effects on T84 monolayer  , measured by transepithelial resistance, as Snail-KD impaired the  (with or without butyrate), whereas Slug-KD enhanced the , again with or without butyrate. Targeted transcriptional analysis demonstrated differential expression of several tight junction genes, as well as focal adhesion genes. This included altered regulation of Annexin A2 and ITGB1 in Slug-KD, which was reflected in confocal microscopy, showing increased accumulation of B1-integrin protein in Slug-KD cells, which was previously shown to impair wound healing. Transcriptional analysis also indicated altered expression of genes associated with epithelial terminal differentiation, such that Slug-KD cells skewed toward overexpression of secretory cell pathway-associated genes. This included trefoil factors TFF1 and TFF3, which were expressed at lower than control levels in Snail-KD cells. Since TFFs can enhance the  in epithelial cells, this points to a potential mechanism of differential modulation by Snail genes. Although Snail genes are crucial in epithelial wound restitution, butyrate responses are mediated by other pathways as well. Although butyrate can promote colonic mucosal healing, not all of its downstream pathways are understood. We show that the Snail genes Snail and Slug are mediators of butyrate responses. Furthermore, these genes, and Slug in particular, are necessary for efficient restitution of wounds and barriers in T84 epithelial cells even in the absence of butyrate. These effects are achieved in part through effects on regulation of β1 integrin and cellular differentiation state.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30638239>Lentinan modulates intestinal microbiota and enhances   in a piglet model challenged with lipopolysaccharide.</a></h1><p>The intestinal microbiota plays a vital role in metabolism, pathogen resistance, and immune development in host cells, and is modifiable by dietary change. Lentinan (LNT), a type of mushroom polysaccharide, is known to ameliorate intestinal inflammation with the potential of therapeutic effect on digestive diseases. We hypothesized that LNT could alleviate Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intestinal injury via regulating the composition and metabolites of intestinal microbiota in a piglet model. Twenty-four weaned piglets were used in a 2 × 2 factorial design, and the main factors included a dietary treatment (basal or LNT diet) and immunological challenge (LPS or saline). After feeding basal or LNT diet for 21 days, pigs were injected with LPS or saline. At 4 h post-injection, pigs were killed and jejunum, ileum and cecal digesta were collected. LNT improved intestinal morphology and  function. LNT also inhibited inflammatory signaling pathways (toll-like receptor 4 and nucleotide binding oligomerization domain protein) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β and interleukin-6) expression, as well as up-regulated the heat shock protein 70 expression in small intestine. In addition, LNT enhanced the concentrations of propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate and isovalerate in cecal digesta, resulting in a significant increase in histone acetylation without affecting the protein level of G protein-coupled receptor 41 (GPR41), a short chain fatty  receptor. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing showed that LNT had a great impact on gut microbiota composition at different taxonomic levels. Moreover, the correlation analysis revealed some potential relationships between cecal metabolites and certain intestinal microbiota. These results indicate that LNT promotes intestinal health, in part, through altering intestinal microbiota composition and increasing the short chain fatty  synthesis, which subsequently lead to a reduction in inflammation and hyper-acetylation of histones.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30215189>Biocompatibility Studies of Gadolinium Complexes with Iminodiacetic  Derivatives.</a></h1><p>Apart from using as radiopharmaceuticals, iminodiacetic  derivatives, after complexation with gadolinium, have been also tested as MRI CAs (magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents) since they show high affinity to hepatocytes and therefore provide high-resolution MRI of the liver. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biocompatibility of four gadolinium complexes with iminodiacetic  (IDA) derivatives differing in substituent in aromatic ring by estimating their influence on plasma hemostasis,  of erythrocyte membrane, and toxicity towards human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The influence of gadolinium-based CAs on plasma hemostasis was evaluated by measuring PT (prothrombin time), APTT (activated partial tromboplastin time), and TT (thrombin time). The effects of tested compounds on RBCs (Red Blood Cells) were assessed using hemolysis assay and microscopy studies. The influence of gadolinium complexes on the  properties of HUVECs was assessed by means of real-time method based on the measurements of the impedance changes of the cells. Gadolinium complexes did not affect significantly PT and TT. APTT measurements revealed significant prolongation in the presence of all tested gadolinium complexes at the concentration higher than 0.5 μmol/mL. Hemolysis assay showed that compounds with alkyl substituents in benzene ring without halogen atom (1-3) do not exert unfavorable effect on the  of erythrocyte membrane over the entire concentration range. All gadolinium complexes at 1.0 μmol/mL contribute to the decrease in HUVEC viability and .

DC., known as rock tea (RT), is traditionally used in Spain as a digestive due to its beneficial properties in bowel disorders. The pharmacological nature of these properties has not been established yet. The aim of this work was to evaluate the therapeutic utility of RT in experimental colitis and to identify chemical constituents with anti-inflammatory and/or anti-oxidative properties. RT extract was prepared with ethanol in a Soxhlet apparatus and analysed by HPLC-DAD. Superoxide radical scavenging properties, xanthine oxidase and lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibitory activity, and capability to lower nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) levels were measured in cell-free and cell-based assays. In the 2.5%-dextran-sodium sulphate (DSS) injury-repair model of ulcerative colitis (UC), mice were daily treated with sulfasalazine (SSZ, as reference drug, 100 mg/kg bw), RT (5, 25 and 50 mg/kg bw, p.o.), or vehicle over 20 days. Colitis was scored daily. Colon samples were examined macroscopically and histopathologically. Protein levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukins 6, and 10 (IL-6, IL-10), inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were studied as markers of oxidative stress and inflammatory activity. The  of the apical epithelial layer was assessed by immunofluorescence staining of zonula ocludens-1 (ZO-1). Finally, intestinal contractility was also evaluated by isometric myography. Fifteen phenolic compounds and three pigments were identified and quantified, of which caffeoylquinic , and the flavonoid, quercetin-3-O-galactoside, were the most abundant. RT extract significantly scavenged superoxide radicals, inhibited 5-LOX activity, and lowered NO and TNF-α levels. DSS-treated mice receiving RT scored clinically lower than controls during the first 3 days of DSS treatment and during the recovery period. SSZ was less effective than RT. Anatomical and histological examination of colon samples revealed that RT significantly prevented colon shortening, increased colon thickness, and lowered the macroscopic damage score. RT also significantly prevented the increase of MPO activity, IL-6 levels, iNOS and COX-2 expression, the loss of ZO-1 apical expression, and normalized contractility disturbances. In conclusion, daily administration of RT showed therapeutic properties in the DSS-model of UC. The benefits of RT can likely be attributed to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant phenolic and flavonoid constituents.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31290452>Hyodeoxycholic  protects the neurovascular unit against oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation-induced injury .</a></h1><p>Calculus bovis is commonly used for the treatment of stroke in traditional Chinese medicine. Hyodeoxycholic  (HDCA) is a bioactive compound extracted from calculus bovis. When combined with cholic , baicalin and jas-minoidin, HDCA prevents hypoxia-reoxygenation-induced brain injury by suppressing endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptotic signaling. However, the effects of HDCA in ischemic stroke injury have not yet been studied. Neurovascular unit (NVU) dysfunction occurs in ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of HDCA on the NVU under ischemic conditions in vitro. We co-cultured primary brain microvascular endothelial cells, neurons and astrocytes using a transwell chamber co-culture system. The NVU was pre-treated with 10.16 or 2.54 μg/mL HDCA for 24 hours before exposure to oxygen-glucose deprivation for 1 hour. The cell counting kit-8 assay was used to detect cell activity. Flow cytometry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling were used to assess apoptosis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, and neurotrophic factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. Oxidative stress-related factors, such as superoxide dismutase, nitric oxide, malondialdehyde and γ-glutamyltransferase, were measured using kits. Pretreatment with HDCA significantly decreased blood-brain  permeability and neuronal apoptosis, significantly increased transendothelial electrical resistance and γ-glutamyltransferase activity, attenuated oxidative stress damage and the release of inflammatory cytokines, and increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor expression. Our findings suggest that HDCA maintains NVU morphological  and function by modulating inflammation, oxidation stress, apoptosis, and the expression of neurotrophic factors. Therefore, HDCA may have therapeutic potential in the clinical management of ischemic stroke.

The catabolism of C3G in the gastrointestinal tract could produce bioactive phenolic metabolites, such as protocatechuic , phloroglucinaldehyde, vanillic , and ferulic , which enhance C3G bioavailability and contribute to both mucosal  and microbiota. To get an overview of the function and mechanisms of C3G and its phenolic metabolites, we review the accumulated data of the absorption and catabolism of C3G in the gastrointestine, and attempt to give crosstalk between the phenolic metabolites, gut microbiota, and mucosal innate immune signaling pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31390532>Chlorogenic  attenuates cadmium-induced intestinal injury in Sprague-Dawley rats.</a></h1><p>Chronic exposure to cadmium (Cd) causes remarkable damage to the liver and gastrointestinal tract. Previous studies have revealed that chlorogenic  (CGA) could improve the intestinal   for weaned rats. Hence, this study sought to investigate the protective effects of CGA from pure reagent and sunflower seed extract (SSE) on growth performance, antioxidant indicators, inflammatory biomarkers and intestinal  function in Cd treated rats. A total of 32 Sprague-Dawley female rats with similar weights were randomly allotted to four treatments: control, CdCl (6 mg/kg BW), co-treatment of Cd (6 mg/kg BW) and pure CGA (50 mg/kg BW), and co-treatment of Cd (6 mg/kg BW) and SSE (50 mg/kg BW) for 14 days. The data indicated that, CGA or SSE with Cd sequestration and good antioxidative ability decreased Cd absorption and accumulation in the jejunum and increased fecal Cd levels in Cd-exposed rats. Compared with the Cd group, co-treatment with CGA or SSE also alleviated inflammation, ameliorated the villus damage, reversed the disruption of tight junctions, and recovered weight gain of rats. These results suggest that CGA or SSE can protect the intestinal , which is related to the alleviation of Cd-induced oxidative stress and growth decrease.Copyright © 2019.

As an endotoxin, LPS induces neuroinflammation, which is associated with the blood-brain  impairment. Lactate is a metabolite with some significant physiological functions within the neurovascular unit/blood-brain  (BBB). Accumulation of extracellular and cerebrospinal fluid lactate is a specific feature of bacterial meningitis. However, the role of lactate production, transport, and sensing by lactate receptors GPR81 in the pathogenesis of bacterial neuroinflammation is still unknown.In this study, we analyzed effects of LPS on the expression of GPR81 and MCT-1 and proliferation of cerebral endothelial cells in the BBB model in vitro. We used molecular profiling methods to measure the expression of GPR81, MCT-1, IL-1β, and Ki67 in the cerebral endothelium after treatment with different concentrations of LPS followed by measuring the level of extracellular lactate, transendothelial electric resistance, and permeability of the endothelial cell layer.Our findings showed that exposure to LPS results in neuroinflammatory changes associated with decreased expression of GPR81 and MCT-1 in endothelial cells, as well as overproduction of IL-1β and elevation of lactate concentrations in the extracellular space in a dose-dependent manner. LPS treatment reduced JAM tight junction protein expression in cerebral endothelial cells and altered BBB structural  in vitro.The impairment of lactate reception and transport might contribute to the alterations of BBB structural and functional  caused by LPS-mediated neuroinflammation.</p></html>
