In this report, we reveal that the methanol-ethyl  partitioned fraction from Chinese olive fruits (MEO), of which ellagic acid accounted for 12%, exhibited profound anti-proliferative activities in the human  cell line, HCT116. Additionally, oral administration of MEO remarkably inhibited the tumor growth of subcutaneously implanted CT26 cells, a mouse  carcinoma cell line, in BALB/c mice. Treatment with MEO induced a significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells and resulted in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, suggesting that MEO inhibits  cell proliferation by promoting apoptosis. Our study also showed that MEO exerted the most potent effect on the inhibition of NF-κB-mediated signaling among the partitioned fractions from Chinese olives. This process employed the use of reporter-based bio-platforms that are capable of detecting the activation of NF-κB. In addition, phosphorylation of NF-κB signaling-associated proteins, IKKα/β, IκBα, and p65, was reduced in MEO-incubated  cells, indicating that MEO suppresses NF-κB activation. Moreover, MEO treatment significantly suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced  cell proliferation, demonstrating that MEO promotes  cell apoptosis through the inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the methanol-ethyl  partitioned fraction from Chinese olive fruits inhibits  cell proliferation and tumor growth by promoting apoptosis through the suppression of NF-κB signaling. Therefore, the Chinese olive fruit has promising potential in  treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29881727>Colorectal  Cells Increase the Production of Short Chain Fatty Acids by  Impacting on  Cells Survival.</a></h2><p> is a commercially relevant bacterium with probiotic potential. This bacterium can exert protective effects particularly against colorectal  (CRC), via the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), namely  and propionate. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the performance and adaptation capacity of  to a simulated digestive stress using different culture media, namely YEL, Basal medium, Mimicking the Content of the Human  medium (MCHC) and DMEM. The effect of the fermented culture broth on CRC cells survival and of CRC cells conditioned media on the bacteria performance was also evaluated. Basal medium was found to be the best for  to produce SCFA. MCHC medium, despite being the medium in which lower amounts of  and propionate were produced, showed higher  and propionate yields as compared to other media. We also observed that the presence of lactate in CRC cells conditioned growth medium resulting from cell metabolism, leads to an increased production of SCFA by the bacteria. The bacterial fermented broth successfully inhibited CRC cells proliferation and increased cell death. Our results showed for the first time that  performance might be stimulated by extracellular lactate produced by CRC metabolic switch also known as "Warburg effect," where  cells "ferment" glucose into lactate. Additionally, our results suggest that  could be potentially used as a probiotic in CRC prevention at early stages of the carcinogenesis process and might help in CRC therapeutic approaches.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30314700>Alisol B-23-, a tetracyclic triterpenoid isolated from Alisma orientale, induces apoptosis in human lung  cells via the mitochondrial pathway.</a></h2><p>Alisol B-23- (AB23A), a tetracyclic triterpenoid isolated from the rhizome of Alisma orientale, has been reported to exert anti-proliferative activities in human , ovarian and gastric  cells. However, the anti- effect of this compound on human lung  cells has not yet been thoroughly elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the effects of AB23A on the cell viability and apoptosis in human lung  A549 and NCI-H292 cells. The results indicated that AB23A inhibited the growth of A549 and NCI-H292 cells in dose- and time-dependent manner, however, there was only weak cytotoxicity on normal bronchial epithelial cells. The induction of apoptosis by AB23A was demonstrated by DAPI and annexin-V-FITC/PI staining. Further investigation revealed that AB23A decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and up regulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Meanwhile, the increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, activated caspase-3, caspase-9 and PARP were observed. In addition, AB23A increased the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and the translocation of apoptotic inducing factor (AIF) into nuclei. Taken together, these results indicated that AB23A induced apoptosis by activating the intrinsic pathway, and suggested that AB23A can be used as a potential modulating agent in lung .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzyme overexpression observed in the majority of cancers is responsible for tumor suppressor gene silencing and activation of proto-oncogenes to oncogenes. Cinnamic acid derivatives exhibit anti- potential through HDAC enzyme inhibition. We have synthesized a few cinnamyl sulfonamide hydroxamate derivatives (NMJ-1, -2 and -3) by already published in-house procedures and their purity, and chemical characterization were performed by NMR, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. The anti- activities were also evaluated against . The rationale for synthesis was based on bioisosterism concept. To take the work forward, these compounds were considered for in vitro anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic activities in  cells. The effectiveness of these compounds was determined by SRB assay. The compounds showed  cell cytotoxicity (IC50 range of 5.7 ± 0.43 to 20.5 ± 1.9 μM). The mechanism of compound-induced cell death involves an intrinsic apoptosis pathway which was supported by the following: increase in apoptotic index, arrest in cell cycle at G2/M phase, increase in annexin V binding and induction of p21(Waf1/Cip1) expression in the treated cells. Further, their target modulating effect, measured as the expression of acetyl-H3 histone and acetyl α-tubulin was determined by Western blots. Hyper acetylation of H3 histone and α-tubulin were observed. Furthermore, increased expression of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, total Bad was estimated by ELISA. The anti-angiogenic effect was examined through cobalt (II) chloride (CoCl2)-induced HIF-1α expression, where the compounds reduced the expression of induced HIF-1α. In addition, their anti-metastatic ability was determined through phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA)-induced expression of MMP-2 and -9 by Western blotting and gelatin zymography. Inhibition of malignant cell migration was assessed by scratch wound assay. The compounds showed a decrease in cell migration and inhibition of induced MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. NMJ-2 exhibited comparable activity to that of standard SAHA. Our findings indicate that NMJ series of compound have potent in vitro anti-, anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic activity through HDAC enzyme inhibition.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Dietary interventions with these foods should be explored for modulating colorectal  risk.A randomized-controlled pilot clinical trial investigated the effects of eating SRB (30 g/day) or cooked navy bean powder (35 g/day) on gut microbiota and metabolites (). Twenty-nine overweight/obese volunteers with a prior history of colorectal  consumed a study-provided meal and snack daily for 28 days. Volunteers receiving SRB or NBP showed increased gut bacterial diversity and altered gut microbial composition at 28 days compared to baseline. Supplementation with SRB or NBP increased total dietary fiber intake similarly, yet only rice bran intake led to a decreased Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio and increased SCFA (propionate and ) in stool after 14 days but not at 28 days.These findings support modulation of gut microbiota and fermentation byproducts by SRB and suggest that foods with similar ability to increase dietary fiber intake may not have equal effects on gut microbiota and microbial metabolism.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Therefore, using modern therapeutic approaches with lower toxicity bring higher chance for successful treatment and reduced adverse effects in such patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of avocado fruit extracts on inhibition of the growth of  cells in comparison with normal cells. In an experimental study, ethanol, chloroform, ethyl , and petroleum extracts of avocado (Persea americana) fruit were prepared. Then, the effects if the extracts on the growth of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and  adenocarcinoma cell lines were evaluated in comparison with the control group using the MTT test in the cell culture medium. Effects of the four extracts of avocado fruit on three cells lines of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and  adenocarcinoma were tested. The results showed that avocado fruit extract is effective in inhibition of  cell growth in comparison with normal cells (P<0.05). Avocado fruit is rich in phytochemicals, which play an important role in inhibition of growth of  cells. The current study for the first time demonstrates the anti- effect of avocado fruit extracts on two cancers common in Iran. Therefore, it is suggested that the fruit extracts can be considered as appropriate complementary treatments in treatment of esophageal and  cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27832690>Cytotoxic Potential of Centaurea bruguierana ssp. belangerana: The MTT Assay.</a></h2><p>The genus Centaurea with an extensive background in Iranian traditional medicine represents more than 70 species in Iran that some of them are endemic to Iran. A variety of secondary metabolites has been isolated from this genus thus far. Sesquiterpene lactones and flavonoids have been reported as main compounds of C.bruguierana. Methanolic extract and different fractions of the whole fruiting samples of Centaurea bruguierana ssp.belangerana (Asteraceae) were examined for cytotoxicity against various cell lines using MTT cytotoxicity assay in order to identify active fraction(s). The chloroform and ethyl  fractions of plant have demonstrated significant cytotoxicity against  adenocarcinoma and breast ductal carcinoma cell lines, which chloroform fraction, exhibited the most potent in vitro cytotoxic activity against  adenocarcinoma cell line, and therefore, can be considered as the potential fraction through main compounds of plant against the adenocarcinoma  cell line. Moreover, only chloroform fraction was moderately active against Swiss embryo fibroblast cell lines while the other fractions were nontoxic. To summarize, the chloroform fraction of C.bruguierana demonstrated better cytotoxic activity against all of the tested cell lines compared with the other fractions; and promisingly in some cases represented moderate to very good cytotoxicity that suggests more investigations about its phytochemical properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28717897>Development of a fast and cost-effective gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method for the quantification of short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids in human biofluids.</a></h2><p>The quantification of short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids is becoming more and more relevant in fecal and plasma samples due to their biological impact, which has been associated with  rectal  and fiber consumption. For these reasons, a fast, cost-effective, and reproducible analytical method is highly required. In this research, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method based on full scan and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) acquisition modes were optimized and validated for the analysis of short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids in three biological samples: human fecal water, fecal fermentation supernatants, and human plasma. Several extraction solvents (acidified water, diethyl ether, dichloromethane, ethyl , and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) were further evaluated, demonstrating that the latter was clearly the most suitable solvent with recoveries from 75.4 to 124.4% and coefficient of variations lower than 20%. The applicability of the GC-MS method was tested, for instance, acetic acid was quantified by using samples of plasma and feces from healthy donors at mean values of 66.9 μM and 24.5 mM, respectively. The optimized protocol could successfully find applications within multi-compartment human studies. In parallel, a second pilot experiment on fecal fermentation supernatants indicated that the proposed protocol is suitable to follow the formation of SCFAs during in vitro fermentation by the human gut microbiota. In summary, the present work provided an improved GC-MS method for precise and accurate quantification of SCFAs and MCFAs in human feces and plasma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25444642>Dietary phytic acid modulates characteristics of the  luminal environment and reduces serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines in rats fed a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>Dietary phytic acid (PA; myo-inositol [MI] hexaphosphate) is known to inhibit  carcinogenesis in rodents. Dietary fiber, which is a negative risk factor of , improves characteristics of the  environment, such as the content of organic acids and microflora. We hypothesized that dietary PA would improve the  luminal environment in rats fed a high-fat diet. To test this hypothesis, rats were fed diets containing 30% beef tallow with 2.04% sodium PA, 0.4% MI, or 1.02% sodium PA + 0.2% MI for 3 weeks. Compared with the control diet, the sodium PA diet up-regulated cecal organic acids, including , propionate, and n-butyrate; this effect was especially prominent for cecal butyrate. The sodium PA + MI diet also significantly increased cecal butyrate, although this effect was less pronounced when compared with the sodium PA diet. The cecal ratio of Lactobacillales, cecal and fecal mucins (an index of intestinal barrier function), and fecal β-glucosidase activity were higher in rats fed the sodium PA diet than in those fed the control diet. The sodium PA, MI, and sodium PA + MI diets decreased levels of serum tumor necrosis factor α, which is a proinflammatory cytokine. Another proinflammatory cytokine, serum interleukin-6, was also down-regulated by the sodium PA and sodium PA + MI diets. These data showed that PA may improve the composition of cecal organic acids, microflora, and mucins, and it may decrease the levels of serum proinflammatory cytokines in rats fed a high-fat, mineral-sufficient diet.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The product of above two scores was the final score.). Association of ACSS2 expression with clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed. Small interfering RNA (siRNA, including A and B group) was used to knock down the expression of ACSS2 in colorectal cell lines (Lovo, HCT116) and their proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (E-cadherin and Snail as markers) after knocking down were observed.The expression of ACSS2 was significant higher in CRC tissue than that in normal colorectal tissue (tumor average score 6.284, normal tissue average score 3.625, P<0.01) and the percentage of positive cell was higher than that in normal tissue (tumor 69.9%, normal tissue 45.1%, P=0.000).

Here we show that RGC-32 expression in macrophages is induced by IL-4 and reduced by LPS, indicating a link between RGC-32 expression and M2 polarization. We demonstrated that the increased expression of RGC-32 is characteristic of alternatively activated macrophages, in which this protein suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and promotes the production of the anti-inflammatory mediator TGF-β. Consistent with in vitro data, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) express high levels of RGC-32, and this expression is induced by tumor-derived ascitic fluid in an M-CSF- and/or IL-4-dependent manner.

TRPM5 was required for PMA and ATP-induced secretion of MUC5AC from the post-Golgi secretory granules. Stable knockdown of TRPM5 reduced a TRPM5-like current and ATP-mediated Ca(2+) signal. ATP-induced MUC5AC secretion depended strongly on Ca(2+) influx, which was markedly reduced in TRPM5 knockdown cells. The difference in ATP-induced Ca(2+) entry between control and TRPM5 knockdown cells was abrogated in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+) and by inhibition of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX). Accordingly, MUC5AC secretion was reduced by inhibition of NCX. Thus TRPM5 activation by ATP couples TRPM5-mediated Na(+) entry to promote Ca(2+) uptake via an NCX to trigger MUC5AC secretion.

Stool samples were collected from healthy adults (n = 10) and colorectal  patients (n = 11) prior to  resection surgery at the University of Colorado Health-Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, CO. The V4 region of the 16s rRNA gene was pyrosequenced and both short chain fatty acids and global stool metabolites were extracted and analyzed utilizing Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). There were no significant differences in the overall microbial community structure associated with the disease state, but several bacterial genera, particularly butyrate-producing species, were under-represented in the CRC samples, while a mucin-degrading species, Akkermansia muciniphila, was about 4-fold higher in CRC (p<0.01). Proportionately higher amounts of butyrate were seen in stool of healthy individuals while relative concentrations of  were higher in stools of CRC patients. GC-MS profiling revealed higher concentrations of amino acids in stool samples from CRC patients and higher poly and monounsaturated fatty acids and ursodeoxycholic acid, a conjugated bile acid in stool samples from healthy adults (p<0.01). Correlative analysis between the combined datasets revealed some potential relationships between stool metabolites and certain bacterial species.

Developing oral drug delivery systems based on commercially available materials is becoming more challenging due to the demand for simultaneously delivering physicochemically different drugs for treating complex diseases. A novel architecture, namely nanotube-in-microsphere, was developed as a drug delivery platform by encapsulating halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) in a pH-responsive hydroxypropyl methylcellulose  succinate polymer using microfluidics. HNTs were selected as orally acceptable clay mineral and their lumen was enlarged by selective acid etching. Model drugs (atorvastatin and celecoxib) with different physicochemical properties and synergistic effect on  prevention and inhibition were simultaneously incorporated into the microspheres at a precise ratio, with atorvastatin and celecoxib being loaded in the HNTs and polymer matrix, respectively. The microspheres showed spherical shape, narrow particle size distribution and pH-responsive dissolution behavior. This nanotube/pH-responsive polymer composite protected the loaded drugs from premature release at pH⩽6.5, but allowed their fast release and enhanced the drug permeability, and the inhibition of  cell proliferation at pH 7.4. Overall, the nano-in-micro drug delivery composite fabricated by microfluidics is a promising and flexible platform for the delivery of multiple drugs for combination therapy.Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) are attracting increasing attention for drug delivery applications. However, conventional HNTs-based oral drug delivery systems are lack of the capability to precisely control the drug release at a desired site in the gastrointestinal tract. In this study, a nanotube-in-microsphere drug delivery platform is developed by encapsulating HNTs in a pH-responsive polymer using microfluidics. Drugs with different physicochemical properties and synergistic effect on  therapy were simultaneously incorporated in the microspheres. The prepared microspheres prevented the premature release of the loaded drugs after exposure to the harsh conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, but allowed their simultaneously fast release, and enhanced the drug permeability and the inhibition of  cell proliferation in response to the  pH.Copyright © 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

Loss of β-catenin activity has previously been found to facilitate  cell dissociation and migration. Here, we aimed to investigate whether epigenetic silencing of β-catenin induces human  cell migration and/or invasion.HCT-116, Caco-2, HT-29 and SW620 cell migration and invasion capacities were assessed using scratch wound healing and Matrigel invasion assays, respectively. Confocal microscopy, qRT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to determine gene expression levels, whereas methylation-specific quantitative real-time PCR was used to assess the extent of β-catenin gene (CTNNB1) promoter methylation after treatment of the cells with TPA, hydrogen peroxide, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and/or VAS2870.We found that treatment of HT-29 and Caco-2 cells (differentiated and low metastatic) with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13- (TPA; a tumor promoter) suppressed E-cadherin and β-catenin expression at both the mRNA and protein levels and, in addition, enhanced cell migration. Furthermore, we found that the CTNNB1 gene promoter methylation levels were higher in the more invasive HCT-116 and SW620  cells than in HT-29 and CCD-841 (normal  epithelial) cells. We also found that TPA or hydrogen peroxide induced CTNNB1 gene promoter methylation to a higher extent in HT-29 and CCD-841 cells than in HCT-116 and SW620 cells, and that the degree of CTNNB1 gene promoter methylation positively correlated with cell dissociation and migration. In addition, we found that co-treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine, a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor) and VAS2870 (a NADPH oxidase inhibitor) almost completely blocked the invasion of TPA-treated HT-29 and TPA-untreated HCT-116 and SW620 cells, and that these inhibitions surpassed those of the cells treated with decitabine or VAS2870 alone.From our data we conclude that the extent of CTNNB1 gene promoter methylation by reactive oxygen species correlates with the migratory and invasive abilities of  cells. Our results suggest that epigenetic regulation of CTNNB1 may serve as a novel avenue to block  cell migration and invasion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26916801>Anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activities of the wild edible cruciferous: Diplotaxis simplex.</a></h2><p>Context The present study deals with new biological properties of the wild edible Diplotaxis simplex (Viv.) Spreng (Brassicaceae). Objectives The current study evaluates the antioxidant, the anti-inflammatory and the anti- properties of ethyl  and ethanol extracts from D. simplex flowers. Materials and methods The anti-proliferative activity of the extracts (10-70 μg/mL) was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) against human  cell line Caco-2. The anti-inflammatory potential was evaluated by the inhibitory effect of the extracts (1.5-7.5 mg/mL) on phospholipase A2 activity as well as on carrageenan-induced paw oedema in mice. Extracts (200 mg/kg) or indomethacin (50 mg/kg) as positive control were injected intraperitoneally for albino mice prior to the induction of the oedema by carrageenan. Antioxidant activities were investigated using various complementary methods. Results Flower extracts contained a high level of polyphenolics (17.10-52.70 mg GAE/g) and flavonoids (74.20-100.60 mg QE/g), which correlate with its appreciable antioxidant potential in β-carotene peroxidation (IC50 value: 12.50-27.10 μg/mL), DPPH(•) radical-scavenging (IC50 value: 0.20-0.40 mg/mL), Fe(3+ )reducing (EC50 value: 0.10-0.14 mg/mL) and Fe(2+ )chelating (IC50 value: 0.20-0.60 mg/mL) assays. These extracts were effective in inhibiting  cell growth (IC50 value: 62.0-63.25 μg/mL). Besides, the ethyl  extract inhibited phospholipase A2 activity (IC50 value: 2.97 mg/mL) and reduced the paw oedema in mice (from 0.38 ± 0.01 to 0.24 ± 0.01 cm), 4 h post-carrageenan challenge.

This review summarizes recent research results for dysregulated glucose metabolism of SCFAs, which could be initiated by gut microbiome of CRC. Moreover, the relationship between SCFA transporters and glycolysis, which may correlate with the initiation and progression of CRC, are also discussed. Additionally, this review explores the linkage of BT to transport of SCFAs expressions between normal and cancerous colonocyte cell growth for tumorigenesis inhibition in CRC. Furthermore, the link between gut microbiota and SCFAs in the metabolism of CRC, in addition, the proteins and genes related to SCFAs-mediated signaling pathways, coupled with their correlation with the initiation and progression of CRC are also discussed. Therefore, targeting the SCFA transporters to regulate lactate generation and export of BT, as well as applying SCFAs or gut microbiota and natural compounds for chemoprevention may be clinically useful for CRCs treatment. Future research should focus on the combination these therapeutic agents with metabolic inhibitors to effectively target the tumor SCFAs and regulate the bacterial ecology for activation of potent anticancer effect, which may provide more effective application prospect for CRC therapy.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25427913>Acetaldehyde and retinaldehyde-metabolizing enzymes in  and pancreatic cancers.</a></h2><p>Colorectal  (CRC) and pancreatic  are two very significant contributors to -related deaths. Chronic alcohol consumption is an important risk factor for these cancers. Ethanol is oxidized primarily by alcohol dehydrogenases to acetaldehyde, an agent capable of initiating tumors by forming adducts with proteins and DNA. Acetaldehyde is metabolized by ALDH2, ALDH1B1, and ALDH1A1 to . Retinoic acid (RA) is required for cellular differentiation and is known to arrest tumor development. RA is synthesized from retinaldehyde by the retinaldehyde dehydrogenases, specifically ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3, and ALDH8A1. By eliminating acetaldehyde and generating RA, ALDHs can play a crucial regulatory role in the initiation and progression of cancers. ALDH1 catalytic activity has been used as a biomarker to identify and isolate normal and  stem cells; its presence in a tumor is associated with poor prognosis in  and pancreatic . In summary, these ALDHs are not only biomarkers for CRC and pancreatic  but also play important mechanistic role in  initiation, progression, and eventual prognosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26173414>ALDH2 Deficiency Promotes Ethanol-Induced Gut Barrier Dysfunction and Fatty Liver in Mice.</a></h2><p>Acetaldehyde, the toxic ethanol (EtOH) metabolite, disrupts intestinal epithelial barrier function. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) detoxifies acetaldehyde into . Subpopulations of Asians and Native Americans show polymorphism with loss-of-function mutations in ALDH2. We evaluated the effect of ALDH2 deficiency on EtOH-induced disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions and adherens junctions, gut barrier dysfunction, and liver injury.Wild-type and ALDH2-deficient mice were fed EtOH (1 to 6%) in Lieber-DeCarli diet for 4 weeks. Gut permeability in vivo was measured by plasma-to-luminal flux of FITC-inulin, tight junction and adherens junction integrity was analyzed by confocal microscopy, and liver injury was assessed by the analysis of plasma transaminase activity, histopathology, and liver triglyceride.EtOH feeding elevated  mucosal acetaldehyde, which was significantly greater in ALDH2-deficient mice. ALDH2(-/-) mice showed a drastic reduction in the EtOH diet intake. Therefore, this study was continued only in wild-type and ALDH2(+/-) mice. EtOH feeding elevated mucosal inulin permeability in distal , but not in proximal , ileum, or jejunum of wild-type mice. In ALDH2(+/-) mice, EtOH-induced inulin permeability in distal  was not only higher than that in wild-type mice, but inulin permeability was also elevated in the proximal , ileum, and jejunum. Greater inulin permeability in distal  of ALDH2(+/-) mice was associated with a more severe redistribution of tight junction and adherens junction proteins from the intercellular junctions. In ALDH2(+/-) mice, but not in wild-type mice, EtOH feeding caused a loss of junctional distribution of tight junction and adherens junction proteins in the ileum. Histopathology, plasma transaminases, and liver triglyceride analyses showed that EtOH-induced liver damage was significantly greater in ALDH2(+/-) mice compared to wild-type mice.These data demonstrate that ALDH2 deficiency enhances EtOH-induced disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions, barrier dysfunction, and liver damage.Copyright © 2015 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24324366>Modulation of β-catenin signaling by the inhibitors of MAP kinase, tyrosine kinase, and PI3-kinase pathways.</a></h2><p>Aberrant activation of β-catenin signaling plays an important role in human tumorigenesis. However, molecular mechanisms behind the β-catenin signaling deregulation are mostly unknown because genetic alterations in this pathway only account for a small fraction of tumors. Here, we investigator if other major pathways can regulate β-catenin signaling activity. By employing a panel of chemical activators and/or inhibitors of several cellular signaling pathways, we assess these modulators' effects on luciferase reporter driven by β-catenin/TCF4-responsive elements. We find that lithium-stimulated β-catenin activity is synergistically enhanced by protein kinase C activator PMA. However, β-catenin-regulated transcriptional (CRT) activity is significantly inhibited by casein kinase II inhibitor DRB, MEK inhibitor PD98059, G-proteins and their receptor uncoupling agent suramin, protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, and PI-3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin, suggesting that these cellular pathways may participate in regulating β-catenin signaling. Interestingly, the Ca⁺⁺/calmodulin kinase II inhibitor HDBA is shown to activate β-catenin activity at low doses. Furthermore, Wnt3A-stimulated and constitutively activated CRT activities, as well as the intracellular accumulation of β-catenin protein in human  cells, are effectively suppressed by PD98059, genistein, and wortmannin. We further demonstrate that EGF can activate TCF4/β-catenin activity and induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin protein. Thus, our results should provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Wnt/β-catenin activation. This knowledge should facilitate our efforts to develop efficacious and novel therapeutics by targeting these pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555288>Isolation, synthesis and biological evaluation of phenylpropanoids from the rhizomes of Alpania galanga.</a></h2><p>Bioactivity guided investigation of the DCM: MeOH (1:1) extract from the rhizomes of Alpinia galanga led to the isolation of phenylpropanoids (1-9) and their structures were established by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR a nd LC-MS/MS.

The activity of SphK1 was assayed by autoradiography, the cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay, cell migration and invasion were examined by Boyden chamber assay, concentrations of sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 were assayed by ELISA, and RT-PCR and Western blot were used to evaluate the mRNA and protein expression in the cells.The activity of SphK1 was efficiently induced by PMA and significantly suppressed by DMS. PMA induced cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. On the contrast, DMS suppressed cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. After treating with PMA, the number of migrating and invasing cells were increased to 143.36 ± 8.73 and 118.46 ± 6.25, significantly higher than those of the control group (75.48 ± 6.12 and 64.19 ± 5.36).

No effect was observed in women treated with estrogen alone. This suggests that progesterone, or more specifically the progestin MPA may have chemopreventive activity. The effect of MPA on colorectal carcinogenesis has been difficult to study in animal models. Most models are not affected by either depleting female hormones by ovariectomy or treatment with MPA. Importantly, an ovariectomy fails to reproduce one of the hall marks of the postmenopausal state in women with intact ovaries. That is, the continued production of androgens by the atrophic postmenopausal ovaries. Here we show that adenoma incidence is increased in the vinyl cylcohexene diepoxide (VCD) mouse model of the menopause compared to age matched fertile female mice. Treatment with MPA protected VCD treated mice from adenomagenesis, but had no effect on adenoma numbers in age-matched fertile female mice.

Artemisia nilagirica (AR) has a long history of use in Indian traditional medicine to combat a wide variety of diseases including .Considering the vast potential of traditional healing plants to deliver safer, less toxic and efficient chemotherapeutics, we have examined anticancer activity of ethanolic extract, bioactive fractions and sub-fractions of AR against different human  cell lines along with their phytochemical analysis to understand the insights of novel anticancer activities for further preclinical studies.Fresh plant material of AR was procured from the wild, dried and ground. The grinded materials was extracted in ethanol (AR-01) and fractionated into butanol (AR-02), ethyl  (AR-03), hexane (AR-04) and water (AR-05). The cytotoxicity was evaluated against three different human  cell lines, i.e.  (DLD-1), lung (A-549), and breast (MCF-7) using Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay along with non-cancerous VERO cells as control and doxorubicin (DOX) as positive control.

Phytochemical analysis was performed through HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS fragmentation.Ethyl  (AR-03) and hexane (AR-04) fractions were found to be the most cytotoxic against all the tested cell lines. Further, AR-03E and AR-04A sub-fractions were found more specific cytotoxic selectively against DLD-1  cell lines at 100µg/ml concentration. HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS determination revealed the presence of 17 compounds in AR-01. Among them, 4 compounds were reported for the first time in this species.

While the host provides the place and food for the bacteria to colonize and live, the bacteria in turn help the host in energy and nutritional homeostasis, development and maturation of the mucosal immune system, and protection against inflammation and carcinogenesis. In this review, we highlight the molecular mediators of the effective communication between the bacteria and the host, focusing on selective metabolites from the bacteria that serve as messengers to the host by acting through selective receptors in the host . These bacterial metabolites include the short-chain fatty acids , propionate, and butyrate, the tryptophan degradation products indole-3-aldehyde, indole-3-acetic, acid and indole-3-propionic acid, and derivatives of endogenous bile acids. The targets for these bacterial products in the host include the cell-surface G-protein-coupled receptors GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109A and the nuclear receptors aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), and farnesoid X receptor (FXR). The chemical communication between these bacterial metabolite messengers and the host targets collectively has the ability to impact metabolism, gene expression, and epigenetics in  epithelial cells as well as in mucosal immune cells.

Several possible  chemopreventive agents are found in edible plants. Amorphophallus campanulatus (Roxb.) Blume (family: Araceae) is a tuber crop, largely cultivated throughout the plains of India for using its corm as food. This tuber has also been traditionally used for the treatment of abdominal tumors, liver diseases, piles etc. The aim of this study was to evaluate the dose-dependent cytotoxic and apoptosis inducing effects of the sub fractions of A. campanulatus tuber methanolic extract (ACME) viz. petroleum ether fraction (PEF), chloroform fraction (CHF), ethyl  fraction (EAF) and methanolic fraction (MEF) on the  cell line, HCT-15. Antiproliferative effects of the sub fractions of ACME were studied by MTT assay. Apoptotic activity was assessed by DAPI, Annexin V-FITC and JC-1 fluorescent staining. The chemotherapeutic drug, 5-flurouracil (5-FU) was used as positive drug control. The sub fractions of ACME significantly inhibited the proliferation of HCT-15 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the extracts were found to induce apoptosis and were confirmed by DAPI, Annexin V-FITC and JC-1 fluorescent staining. A pronounced results of cytotoxic and apoptotic activities were observed in the cells treated with 5-FU and CHF, whereas, EAF and MEF treated cells exhibited a moderate result and the least effect was observed in PEF treated cells. Our results suggested that, among the sub fractions of ACME, CHF had potent cytotoxic and apoptotic activity and thus it could be explored as a novel target for anticancer drug development. Furthermore, these findings confirm that the sub fractions of ACME dose-dependently suppress the proliferation of HCT-15 cells by inducing apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24583351>Anti-proliferative activity of 2,6-dichloro-9- or 7-(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)-9H- or 7H-purines against several human solid tumour cell lines.</a></h2><p>As leads we took several benzo-fused seven- and six-membered scaffolds linked to the pyrimidine or purine moieties with notable anti-proliferative activity against human breast,  and melanoma cancerous cell lines.

The prepared microcomposites showed monodisperse size distribution, multistage pH-response, precise ratiometric controlled loading degree towards the simultaneously loaded drug molecules, and tailored release kinetics of the loaded cargos. This attractive microcomposite platform protects the payloads from being released at low pH-values, and enhances their release at higher pH-values, which can be further used for  prevention and treatment.

GPR109A expresses in  and intestinal epithelial sites, and involves in DNA methylation and cellular apoptosis. Therefore, it may be assumed that PA has similar action like nicotinic acid and may be effective against colorectal carcinoma (CRC). CRC was produced via subcutaneous injection of dimethylhydrazine (DMH) at 40 mg/kg body weight once in a week for 4 weeks. After that, PA was administered orally at 2 doses of 10 and 25 mg/kg daily for 15 d to observe the antiproliferative effect. Various physiologic, oxidative stress, molecular parameters, histopathology, RT-PCR and NMR based metabolomics were performed to evaluate the antiproliferative potential of PA. Our results collectively suggested that PA reduced body weight, tumor volume and incidence no. to normal. It restored various oxidative stress parameters and normalized IL-2, IL-6, and COX-2 as compared with carcinogen control. In molecular level, overexpressed IL-6 and COX-2 genes became normal after PA administration. Again, normal tissue architecture was prominent after PA administration. Score plots of PLS-DA models exhibited that PA treated groups were significantly different from CRC group. We found that CRC rat sera have increased levels of , glutamine, o-acetyl-glycoprotein, succinate, citrulline, choline, o-acetyl choline, tryptophan, glycerol, creatinine, lactate, citrate and decreased levels of 3-hydroxy butyrate, dimethyl amine, glucose, maltose, myoinositol.

The surface marker and cytokine profiles suggested that secreted CRC factors differentiated THP-1 cells into a "mixed" M1/M2 phenotype, although HT-29 and Colo205 supernatants induced THP-1p cells into predominantly M1-like macrophages and M2-like macrophages, respectively. Further, all three CRC supernatants enhanced the phagocytic capacity and migration of THP-1 and THP-1p cells, altering their phenotype to a more M2-kind.

The authors propose to describe the key microbiora using term 'phylometabolic core of intestinal microbioca which more accurately reflects the functional importance of metabolically active microbiota. Phylometabolic core includes functional groups of microorganisms that perform similar metabolic functions: butyrate-producing bacteria, propionate-producing bacteria, -produc- ing bacteria (acerogens), hydrogenosrophic microorganisms (reductive acetogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogens), lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing bacteria, bacteria involved in bile acids metabolism, bacteria that metabolize proteins and amino acids, vitamin-producing microorganisms, oxalate-degrading bacteria and others. The hypothesis that disturbance of microbial metabolism is the root of many human diseases is discussed. The microbial dysmexabo- lism leads to the metabolic dysbiosis (a particular form of dysbiosis) that is primarily characterized by metabolic abnormalities (e.g. serum, urinary, fetal or exhaled air). Metabolic dysbiosis is not necessarily accompanied by appreciable quantitative and/or qualitative changes in microbiora composition that called taxonomic dysbiosis. Since in the metabolic dysbiosis metabolic pathways can be switched only, it means the need for completely different approaches to its assessment using metabolomics (metabolic fingerprinting, metabolic profiling, meta-metabolomics). Metabolites concentrations in  (feces, biopsy samples), blood (serum, plasma), urine or exhaled air, as well as metabolic profiles of examined substrates can serve as biomarkers. The main clinical variants of metabolic dysbiosis are due to the disturbances in microbial synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (primarily butyrate and propionate) and due to increasing bacterial production of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and secondary bile acids (particularly deoxycholic acid). These kinds of metabolic dysbiosis can eventually lead to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or colorectal  (CRC). The metabolic dysbiosis due to bacterial choline dysmetabolism followed by overproduction of trimethylamine (TMA), arherogenic precursor of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), is associated with atherogenesis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Dysmetabolism of aromatic amino acids leads to changes in the microbial production of phenylalanine and tyrosine derivatives (phenyl carboxylic acid, p-cresol) and tryptophan indole derivatives (indole carboxylic acid, indole) and contributes to pathogenesis in lBS. IBD, CRC, chronic liver and kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, autism and schizophrenia. Metabiotics, a new class of therapeutic agents, e.g. based on microbial metabolites, can correct metabolic dysbiosis, prevent diet- and microbiota-relared diseases and increase the effectiveness of treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26921846>Function and clinical implications of short-chain fatty acids in patients with mixed refractory constipation.</a></h2><p>The present study was designed to investigate the function and clinical implications of stool short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in patients with mixed refractory constipation.Ascending  specimens obtained from 30 patients with ascending  were regarded as the control group. Ascending  specimens obtained from patients with mixed refractory constipation were regarded as the experimental group and were divided into three subgroups, according to Wexner scores [A constipation scoring system to simplify evaluation and management of constipated patients.

The expression of G protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) and of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) were detected by immunofluorescence, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting of  samples.The levels of , propionate and butyrate were significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the densitometric quantification and mean density of GPR43 and ChAT proteins, and expression of GPR43 and CHAT genes, were significantly decreased in the patients with mixed refractory constipation (P < 0.05).In the patients with mixed refractory constipation, the levels of stool SCFAs, including , propionate and butyrate, as well as the levels of GPR43 and ChAT expressed in the , which were all negatively correlated with the Wexner score, were decreased and may be associated with the pathogenesis of mixed refractory constipation.Colorectal Disease © 2016 The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28017997>Nutraceutical properties of cumin residue generated from Ayurvedic industries using cell line models.</a></h2><p>Spent cumin (SC), generated from Ayurvedic industry, was evaluated for its nutraceutical potential in terms of antioxidant, antidiabetic and anticancer properties, and compared with that of the raw cumin (RC). SC and RC seeds were extracted with ethyl  (E) and methanol (M).

The contents of , propionate, butyrate and lactate were quantified in the fermented products, and the growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effects on a human  cell line (HCT-116 cells) were assessed. Most of these strains increased contents of , propionate and butyrate, and promoted lactate conversion. Correlation analysis suggested that butyrate and lactate in the fermentation products were positively and negatively correlated with the measured inhibition ratios (p < .05). The results were mostly consistent with the verification trial results using standard acid solutions. The fermentation products could cause apoptosis via inducing DNA fragmentation and increasing total apoptotic populations in the treated cells. Moreover, the fermentation products with higher growth-inhibitory activities demonstrated the increased apoptosis-inducing properties. In conclusion, these strains could cooperate with adult faecal microbiota to confer inulin fermentation products with higher anti- activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23860197>Rapid diagnosis and staging of colorectal  via high-resolution magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (HR-MAS NMR) spectroscopy of intact tissue biopsies.</a></h2><p>To develop novel metabolite-based models for diagnosis and staging in colorectal  (CRC) using high-resolution magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (HR-MAS NMR) spectroscopy.Previous studies have demonstrated that  cells harbor unique metabolic characteristics relative to healthy counterparts. This study sought to characterize metabolic properties in CRC using HR-MAS NMR spectroscopy.Between November 2010 and January 2012, 44 consecutive patients with confirmed CRC were recruited to a prospective observational study. Fresh tissue samples were obtained from center of tumor and 5 cm from tumor margin from surgical resection specimens. Samples were run in duplicate where tissue volume permitted to compensate for anticipated sample heterogeneity. Samples were subjected to HR-MAS NMR spectroscopic profiling and acquired spectral data were imported into SIMCA and MATLAB statistical software packages for unsupervised and supervised multivariate analysis.A total of 171 spectra were acquired (center of tumor, n = 88; 5 cm from tumor margin, n = 83).  tissue contained significantly increased levels of lactate (P < 0.005), taurine (P < 0.005), and isoglutamine (P < 0.005) and decreased levels of lipids/triglycerides (P < 0.005) relative to healthy mucosa (R2Y = 0.94; Q2Y = 0.72; area under the curve, 0.98).  samples (n = 49) contained higher levels of  (P < 0.005) and arginine (P < 0.005) and lower levels of lactate (P < 0.005) relative to rectal  samples (n = 39). In addition unique metabolic profiles were observed for tumors of differing T-stage.HR-MAS NMR profiling demonstrates -specific metabolic signatures in CRC and reveals metabolic differences between  and rectal cancers. In addition, this approach reveals that tumor metabolism undergoes modification during local tumor advancement, offering potential in future staging and therapeutic approaches.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24075343>Identification of an anticancer compound against HT-29 cells from Phellinus linteus grown on germinated brown rice.</a></h2><p>To isolate and identify the anticancer compound against proliferation of human  cells from ethyl  (EtOAc) extract of Phellinus linteus grown on germinated brown rice (PB).EtOAc extract of PB was partitioned with n-hexane, EtOAc, and water-saturated n-butanol.

Allium species have received much attention owing to their diverse pharmacological properties, including antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities. However, A. victorialis var. platyphyllum needs more study.The chemopreventive potential of A. victorialis var. platyphyllum methanol extracts was examined by measuring 12-O-tetra-decanoylphorbol 13- (TPA)-induced superoxide anion production in the differentiated HL-60 cells, TPA-induced mouse ear edema, and Ames/Salmonella mutagenicity. The apoptosis-inducing capabilities of the extracts were evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, and the DNA fragmentation assay in human  HT-29 cells. Antimetastatic activities of the extracts were also investigated in an experimental mouse lung metastasis model.The methanol extracts of A. victorialis var. platyphyllum rhizome (AVP-R) and A. victorialis var. platyphyllum stem (AVP-S) dose-dependently inhibited the TPA-induced generation of superoxide anion in HL-60 cells and TPA-induced ear edema in mice, as well as 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) -induced bacterial mutagenesis. AVP-R and AVP-S reduced cell viability in a dose-related manner and induced apoptotic morphological changes and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in HT-29 cells. In the experimental mouse lung metastasis model, the formation of tumor nodules in lung tissue was significantly inhibited by the treatment of the extracts.AVP-R and AVP-S possess antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, proapoptotic, and antimetastatic activities.

Because natural products are a significant source of anticancer drugs, it is important to explore cytotoxic activity of novel compounds from natural origin.The aim of this work is to evaluate the cytotoxic capacity of hirsutanone, a diarylheptanoid isolated from Alnus glutinosa leaves. Hirsutanone cytotoxic way of action was also studied.The cytotoxic ability of Alnus glutinosa leaves ethyl  extract was studied over HeLa and PC-3 cell lines, with the MTT colorimetric assay. Hirsutanone was isolated from this extract using chromatographic methods, and its structure elucidated by spectroscopic analysis. HT-29 cell viability after hirsutanone treatment was determined using SRB assay. In order to understand hirsutanone way of action, cytotoxicity was evaluated adding the diarylheptanoid and antioxidants. DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) poison activity, was also evaluated using purified topo II and a supercoiled form of DNA that bears specific topo II recognition and binding region; topo II poisons stabilize normally transient DNA-topo II cleavage complexes, and lead an increased yield of linear form as a consequence of a lack of double-strand breaks rejoining.The diarylheptanoid hirsutanone was isolated from Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn. (Betulaceae) leaves extract that showed cytotoxic activity against PC-3 and HeLa cell lines. Hirsutanone showed cytotoxic activity against HT-29 human  carcinoma cells. Pre-treatment with the antioxidants NAC (N-acetylcysteine) and MnTMPyP (Mn(III)tetrakis-(1-methyl-4-pyridyl)porthyrin) reduced this activity, suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) participate in hirsutanone-induced  cell death. Using human topo II and a DNA supercoiled form, hirsutanone was found to stabilize topo II-DNA cleavage complexes, acting as a topo II poison.Our data suggest that, like curcumin, an induction of oxidative stress and topo II-mediated DNA damage may play a role in hirsutanone-induced  cell death. Since both compounds share similar structure and cytotoxic profile, and curcumin is in clinical trials for the treatment of , our results warrant further studies to evaluate the anticancer potential of hirsutanone.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

Some physicians implicate natural progesterone in an increase in the risk of breast . The chemical structure of natural progesterone (P4) is quite different from chemically altered, synthetic chemicals called progestins, which results in different actions at the cell level. Objective • The research team intended to review the literature to examine the benefits and safety of natural progesterone and determine whether it can cause an increase or decrease in breast  risk. Design • A review of the medical literature to examine the benefits and safety of natural progesterone as compared with synthetic progestins. Intervention • Studies examined compared controls not receiving hormone therapy with women receiving estrogen alone and in combination with natural progesterone and with various synthetic progestins, such as medroxyprogesterone -the most commonly used synthetic progestin. Outcome Measures • Outcome measures included factors such as progression and survival of breast and other cancers and other epidemiological and laboratory data. Results • A meta-analysis of 3 studies involving 86 881 postmenopausal women reported that the use of natural progesterone was associated with a significantly lower risk of breast  compared with synthetic progestins. Anovulation and low levels of serum progesterone have been associated with a significantly higher risk of breast  in premenopausal women. Use of progesterone has been linked to lower rates of uterine and  cancers and may also be useful in treating other cancers such as ovarian, melanoma, mesothelioma, and prostate. Progesterone may also be helpful in preventing cardiovascular disease and preventing and treating neurodegenerative conditions such a stroke and traumatic brain injury. Conclusions • Physicians should have no hesitation prescribing natural progesterone. The evidence is clear that progesterone does not cause breast .

Dietary fibers are non-digestible polysaccharides that are composed of complex carbohydrates. Based on their relative solubility in water, dietary fibers can be divided into insoluble and soluble forms. An important property of insoluble fibers is their ability to bind with carcinogens, mutagens, and other toxic chemicals that are formed during digestion of food and eliminate them through the feces. Soluble fibers can often be degraded to short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, propionate, and  by microbial fermentation. This review discusses mechanisms of action of fibers and their beneficial effects on the GI tract as well as on other organs. Among short-chain fatty acids, butyrate has been most extensively studied and the effects of sodium butyrate on cell culture and animal models are discussed in order to emphasize its potential value in prevention of certain diseases.Copyright © 2018.

Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), a prototypical PAH compound is released into the environment from automobile exhausts, cigarette smoke, and industrial emissions. Additionally, considerable intake of BaP is expected in people who consume barbecued foods and a diet rich in saturated fat. In exposed animals, BaP becomes activated to potent metabolites that interfere with target organ function and as a consequence cause toxicity and . Therefore, knowledge of BaP metabolism in the digestive system will be of importance in the management of cancers of the digestive tract. The objective of our study was to study the metabolism of BaP by subcellular fractions (nuclear, cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal) of the gastrointestinal tract and liver. Subcellular fractions were isolated by differential centrifugation from the stomach, jejunum, , and liver tissues of Apc(Min) mice that received a subchronic dose of 25 μg/kg BaP. The fractions were incubated with 1 and 3 μM BaP. Subsequent to incubation, samples were extracted with ethyl  and analyzed for BaP metabolites by reverse-phase HPLC equipped with fluorescence detection. Among the different fractions tested, microsomal BaP metabolism was higher than the rest of the fractions in all the samples analyzed. Additionally, a BaP exposure concentration-dependent effect on metabolite levels generated by the subcellular fractions was recorded. The BaP metabolites identified were the following: BaP-9,10-diol; BaP-4,5-diol; BaP-7,8-diol; 9(OH) BaP; 3(OH) BaP; BaP-3,6-dione; and BaP-6,12-dione. While the diol group of metabolites was frequently detected, among diones, the 3,6 and 6,12-dione metabolites were infrequently detected. Among the diol metabolites, the preponderance of BaP-7,8-dihydrodiol is interesting, since this metabolite is a precursor to the DNA-reactive BaP-7,8-dihydrodiol epoxide (BPDE) that has been linked to BaP-induced .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30250967>Involvement of butyrate in electrogenic K secretion in rat rectal .</a></h2><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as , propionate, and butyrate, are synthesized from dietary carbohydrates by  bacterial fermentation. These SCFAs supply energy, suppress , and affect ion transport. However, their roles in ion transport and regulation in the intracellular environment remain unknown. In order to elucidate the roles of SCFAs, we measured short-circuit currents (I) and performed RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses of ion transporters in rat rectal . The application of 30 mM butyrate shifted I in a negative direction, but did not attenuate the activity of epithelial Na channels (ENaC). The application of bumetanide, a Na-K-2Cl cotransporter inhibitor, to the basolateral side reduced the negative I shift induced by butyrate. The application of XE991, a KCNQ-type K channel inhibitor, to the apical side decreased the I shift induced by butyrate in a dose-dependent manner. The I shift was independent of HCO and insensitive to ibuprofen, an SMCT1 inhibitor. The mucosa from rat rectal  expressed mRNAs of H-coupled monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1, MCT4, and MCT5, also referred to as SLC16A1, SLC16A3, and SLC16A4, respectively).

Here, we asked whether other MAPKs regulate M3R agonist-induced  expression. In addition to activating ERK1/2, we found that treating  cells with acetylcholine (ACh) stimulated robust time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Unlike ERK1/2 activation, ACh-induced p38 phosphorylation was EGFR-independent and blocked by inhibiting protein kinase C-α (PKC-α). Inhibiting activation of PKC-α, EGFR, ERK1/2, or p38-α/β alone attenuated, but did not abolish ACh-induced  expression, a finding that predicted potentiating interactions between these pathways. Indeed, ACh-induced  expression was abolished by incubating cells with either an EGFR or MEK/ERK1/2 inhibitor combined with a p38-α/β inhibitor.

This study evaluated the chemopreventive properties of an ethyl  extract of A. muricata leaves (EEAML) on azoxymethane-induced  aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in rats. Moreover, the cytotoxic compound of EEAML (Annomuricin E) was isolated, and its apoptosis-inducing effect was investigated against HT-29  cell line using a bioassay-guided approach. This experiment was performed on five groups of rats: negative control,  control, EEAML (250 mg/kg), EEAML (500 mg/kg) and positive control (5-fluorouracil). Methylene blue staining of colorectal specimens showed that application of EEAML at both doses significantly reduced the  ACF formation compared with the  control group. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed the down-regulation of PCNA and Bcl-2 proteins and the up-regulation of Bax protein after administration of EEAML compared with the  control group. In addition, an increase in the levels of enzymatic antioxidants and a decrease in the malondialdehyde level of the  tissue homogenates were observed, suggesting the suppression of lipid peroxidation. Annomuricin E inhibited the growth of HT-29 cells with an IC50 value of 1.62 ± 0.24 μg/ml after 48 h. The cytotoxic effect of annomuricin E was further substantiated by G1 cell cycle arrest and early apoptosis induction in HT-29 cells. Annomuricin E triggered mitochondria-initiated events, including the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the leakage of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Prior to these events, annomuricin E activated caspase 3/7 and caspase 9.

Several years ago, Human Microbiome Project (HMP) researchers generated a list of "most wanted" taxa: bacteria both prevalent among healthy volunteers and distantly related to any sequenced organisms. Unfortunately, the challenge of assembling high-quality genomes from a tangle of metagenomic reads has slowed progress in learning about these uncultured bacteria. Here, we describe how recent advances in sequencing and analysis allowed us to assemble "most wanted" genomes from metagenomic data collected from four stool samples. Using a combination of both de novo and guided assembly methods, we assembled and binned over 100 genomes from an initial data set of over 1,300 Gbp. One of these genome bins, which met HMP's criteria for a "most wanted" taxa, contained three essentially complete genomes belonging to a previously uncultivated species. This species is most closely related to Eubacterium desmolans and the clostridial cluster IV/Clostridium leptum subgroup species Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum (71-76% average nucleotide identity). Gene function analysis indicates that the species is an obligate anaerobe, forms spores, and produces the anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids  and butyrate. It also appears to take up metabolically costly molecules such as cobalamin, methionine, and branch-chained amino acids from the environment, and to lack virulence genes. Thus, the evidence is consistent with a secondary degrader that occupies a host-dependent, nutrient-scavenging niche within the gut; its ability to produce butyrate, which is thought to play an anti-inflammatory role, makes it intriguing for the study of diseases such as  and inflammatory bowel disease. In conclusion, we have assembled essentially complete genomes from stool metagenomic data, yielding valuable information about uncultured organisms' metabolic and ecologic niches, factors that may be required to successfully culture these bacteria, and their role in maintaining health and causing disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30037062>Identification and Growth Inhibitory Activity of the Chemical Constituents from  Aerial Part Ethyl  Extract.</a></h2><p> (L.) Raeusch. (IMP) aerial part ethyl  extract has anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and pro-oxidative effects towards colorectal  in vitro. The chemical constituents of IMP aerial part ethyl  extract were isolated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and identified with tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) in combination with ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry and 400 MHz NMR.

Fluorescence microscopy, using DAPI and acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO-ETBR), was carried out to evaluate the effect of germanicol on cellular morphology and apoptosis induction. Apoptosis quantification was performed by Annexin V-FITC assay, while cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry using propidium iodide (PI).The results revealed that germanicol showed selective, potent and dose-dependent cytotoxicity in HCT-116 and HT29 human  cells, while it showed lower cytotoxicity in normal  cells (human  fibroblast, CCD-18Co). LDH assay also showed that germanicol induced dose-dependent cell death in HCT-116 and HT29 cells. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that germanicol induced apoptosis via chromatin condensation and DNA damage in HCT-116  cells. It also revealed that the percentage of cells with orange and red fluorescence increased when adding a germanicol dose, indicating apoptosis. Germanicol also inhibited  cell migration.The current findings reveal that germanicol exhibits selective antiproliferative activity against two human  cells. The normal cell line was less affected by the drug, as compared to the two  cell lines, indicating that germanicol will not target normal living cells. The antiproliferative effect was shown to be mediated through the induction of apoptosis and suppression of cell migration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058564>Chemopreventive Potential of Apple Pulp Callus Against Colorectal  Cell Proliferation and Tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>This study focused on the evaluation of the chemopreventive potential of tissue  culture of the "Mela Rosa Marchigiana" apple (MRM callus) that allows the amplification of secondary metabolites. The MRM pulp and MRM callus chemopreventive potential was evaluated in terms of antiproliferative activity, inhibition of tumorigenesis in soft agar cultures, cell cycle and western blotting analyses in CaCo2 and LoVo  cell lines and in JB6 promotion-sensitive (JB6 P) cells. MRM callus induced a strong concentration-dependent inhibition of  cell proliferation and suppressed 12-o-tetra-decanoyl-phorbol-13--induced tumorigenesis of JB6 P cells in soft agar cultures. MRM callus inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK, p38, and eIF2alpha.

Some studies have suggested an increased  risk among MS patients treated with immunosuppressive (IS) therapies.  risk among Finnish MS patients has previously been studied from an incidence cohort from 1964 to 1993 followed until year 1999. The objective of this nested case-control study was to assess the  risk among Finnish MS patients in a hospital district cohort from southwest Finland during the DMT era.Patients with MS and  comorbidity were identified from the hospital administrative data at the Hospital District of Southwest Finland during a period from 1.1.2004 to 31.12.2012. Case ascertainment for MS diagnosis by the McDonald criteria was performed by review of medical records. During the follow-up 1074 confirmed MS cases were treated in the hospital district, including the deceased cases after 1.1.2004 (5.9%, n = 70). The randomly chosen 10-fold control population was matched by birth year and gender to calculate the coincident risks (odds ratio, OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each  diagnosis. Another separate control population from the same patient pool was used to verify the stability of the results. The Kaplan-Meier analysis and ANOVA test log rank test was applied to study cumulative index proportion and age (years) at breast  diagnosis in the MS and in the control group.A total of 61 (5,7%) of the MS patients and 757 (7,0%) of the controls were diagnosed with  during the study period. The overall risk of  in the MS cohort did not significantly differ form the controls (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.6-1.0, p = 0.092). The age at breast  diagnosis in the MS cohort was statistically significantly higher in comparison to the control cohort (61,7 vs. 55.7 years, ANOVA test p-value 0.010). However, the risk for breast  did not statistically significantly differ between MS patients and controls (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.5-1.4, p-value 0.566). In the MS cohort we observed an increased risk of oral cavity cancers (OR 10, CI 1.1-94.2, p-value 0.04),  (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-5.2, p-value 0.037), lung  (OR 4.4, CI 1.5-13.0, p-value 0.007), renal  (OR 3.6, CI 1.2-10.6, p-value 0.018), brain  (OR 5, 95% CI 1.1-23.0, p-value 0.039) and thyroid  (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.2-10.6, p-value 0.018), and a decreased risk for prostate  (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.8, p-value 0.026), although for these  subtypes the patient numbers were small.Overall risk of  in our MS cohort did not significantly differ from the controls. However, the age at diagnosis of breast  was statistically significantly higher among the MS patients in comparison with a control population from the same patient pool. Further population-based larger studies spanning longer follow-up periods and longer exposure to emerging MS therapies are needed to evaluate  risk related to MS treatments and breast  risk in particular.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Propolis is a widely used natural product by different ancient cultures and known to exhibit biological activities beneficial for health. The large number of studies conducted with propolis had shown that its chemical composition differs as a function of the climate, plant diversity and bee species and plays an important role on its therapeutic properties. The aim of this study was to analyse the phytochemical profile of the ethanolic extract of red propolis (EEP) and its fractionation, antioxidant action of EEP and its fractions hexane, cloroform and ethyl  and cytotoxic activity of EEP on human tumour cell lines SF-295 (glioblastoma), OVCAR-8 (ovary) and HCT-116 ().EEP was obtained by maceration with absolute ethanol, then it was concentrated in rotaevaporator up to complete evaporation of the solvent. The crude extract was fractionated with hexane, ethyl , chloroform and methanol and they were subjected to phytochemical screening and total phenolic compounds. Antioxidant activity of EEP and fractions was done by means of the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) method. Biomarkers of red propolis were identified by LC-Orbitrap-FTMS. To assess cytotoxic activity of the extract, cells were exposed to EEP over 72 h. Cell viability was assessed by means of MTT assay. The percentage of cell growth inhibition (IC50) was analysed by means of non-linear regression, and the absorbance values of the various investigated concentrations were subjected to one-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's or Tamhane's tests (α = 0.05).The results obtained using phytochemical screening and LC-Orbitrap-FTMS indicated the presence of phlobaphene tannins, catechins, chalcones, aurones, flavonones, flavonols, xanthones, pentacyclic triterpenoids and guttiferones in Brazilian red propolis. EEP and its hexane, chloroform and ethyl  fractions obtained by liquid-liquid partitioning exhibited satisfactory antioxidant percentages. EEP (IC50 < 34.27 μg/mL) exhibited high levels of cytotoxicity on all human tumour cell lines tested when compared to negative control.C-Orbitrap-FTMS was useful to establish the chemical profile of the red propolis. Brazilian red propolis has antioxidant properties and decreases substantially the percentage of cell survival of human tumour cells; thus, it has potential to serve as an anticancer drug.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28242546>Characterization and evaluation of bioactive polyphenolic constituents from Zanthoxylum armatum DC., a traditionally used plant.</a></h2><p>Zanthoxylum armatum or Timoor has been used in different traditional system of medicine due to its aromatic properties and also in the treatment of , diarrhea and cholera. In the present investigation, four chemically distinct compounds namely Tambulin (6), Prudomestin (7), Ombuin (8) and 3, 4, 5, 3', 4', 5'-hexahydroxydiphenyl ether (9) have been isolated and quantified from the fruits. To explore the biological activities, we have further studied the antiproliferative, antimicrobial and antioxidant efficacy. Tambulin which was also found in maximum amount (0.125%) in fruits revealed significant antiproliferative activity (IC 37.96±0.36 to 48.7±0.21μg/mL) against breast, liver,  and skin  cell lines corroborated by resilient binding interaction with SDH (-6.76Kcal/mol) and inhibition constant (Ki: 11.02μM). Hexane and ethyl  fraction exhibited moderate antibacterial efficacy (MIC: 250-1000μg/mL) against selected pathogenic microbes while Ombuin displayed broad spectrum antibacterial effect with MIC ranges from 125 to 500μg/mL. Total phenolic content (5.27±0.06 to 46.12±0.40mg/g of gallic acid equivalents), total flavonoids content (6.05±0.24 to 14.46±0.73mg/g of quercetin equivalents), ferric reducing power (42.35±0.85 to 62.52±0.66mg/g of ferrous sulfate equivalents) and percent free radical scavenging activity (59.56±0.38 to 64.85±1.78) were also estimated. Our findings infer that Tambulin exhibited significant antiproliferative activity whereas Ombuin was found to display broad spectrum antibacterial activity which adds one more positive attribute to its traditional usage.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Using Cyp1a1 mRNA as an Ah-responsive end point, we observed that the tryptophan metabolites were weak AhR agonists and partial antagonists in YAMC cells, and the pattern of activity was different from that previously observed in CaCo2  cells. However, expansion of the end points to other Ah-responsive genes including the Cyp1b1, the AhR repressor (Ahrr), and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-inducible poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (TiParp) revealed a highly complex pattern of AhR agonist/antagonist activities that were both ligand- and gene-dependent. For example, the magnitude of induction of Cyp1b1 mRNA was similar for TCDD, tryptamine, and indole-3-, whereas lower induction was observed for indole and indole-3-aldehyde was inactive. These results suggest that the tryptophan metabolites identified in microbiota are selective AhR modulators.Copyright © 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25368192>Sex disparity in  adenomagenesis involves promotion by male hormones, not protection by female hormones.</a></h2><p>It recently has been recognized that men develop  adenomas and carcinomas at an earlier age and at a higher rate than women. In the Apc(Pirc/+) (Pirc) rat model of early  , this sex susceptibility was recapitulated, with male Pirc rats developing twice as many adenomas as females. Analysis of large datasets revealed that the Apc(Min/+) mouse also shows enhanced male susceptibility to adenomagenesis, but only in the . In addition, WT mice treated with injections of the carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) showed increased numbers of  adenomas in males. The mechanism underlying these observations was investigated by manipulation of hormonal status. The preponderance of  adenomas in the Pirc rat model allowed a statistically significant investigation in vivo of the mechanism of sex hormone action on the development of  adenomas. Females depleted of endogenous hormones by ovariectomy did not exhibit a change in prevalence of adenomas, nor was any effect observed with replacement of one or a combination of female hormones. In contrast, depletion of male hormones by orchidectomy (castration) markedly protected the Pirc rat from adenoma development, whereas supplementation with testosterone reversed that effect. These observations were recapitulated in the AOM mouse model. Androgen receptor was undetectable in the  or adenomas, making it likely that testosterone acts indirectly on the tumor lineage.

In most cases, a dose- and time-dependent inhibition on the proliferation of the  cells was observed. This was most significant in WiDr () cells, where the percentages of viability reduced to as low as 6%, 5%, and 17% (at 1000 µg 72 h) by extracts from Diamond shell, Storm shell, and Tua tua species, respectively. A549 (lung) cells were the least susceptible to the treatment, with viability percentages at 82%, 15%, and 45%, under the same conditions. Induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis and alterations to the cell cycle further supported the observed morphological analysis. The ethanol, petroleum ether, and ethyl  fractions of NZ surf clam, rich in lipids and proteins, were more potent than their water-based counterpart. This is the first demonstration where extracts from NZ surf clams show the ability to inhibit the growth and proliferation of  cell lines.

Because inflammation frequently accompanies the progress of colorectal  (CRC), we have evaluated the anticancer properties of the ethanolic extract from the bark (EEB) of S. aegyptiaca, a Salix species endogenous to the Middle East, using HCT-116 and HT29 CRC cell lines. Fresh bark from S. aegyptiaca was extracted with ethanol, fractionated by solvent-solvent partitioning and the fractions were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Catechin, catechol, and salicin were the most abundant constituents of the extract. Interestingly, EEB showed the highest anticancer effect in the  cells followed by its fractions in ethyl  and water, with catechin, catechol, and salicin showing the least efficacy. EEB could strongly reduce the proliferation of the  cells, but not of CCD-18Co, normal  fibroblast cell line. Accompanying this was cell cycle arrest at G1/S independent of DNA damage in the  cells, induction of apoptosis through a p53 dependent pathway and an inhibition of PI3K/Akt and MAP Kinase pathways at levels comparable to known commercial inhibitors. We propose that the combination of the polyphenols and flavonoids in EEB contributes toward its potent anticarcinogenic effects. [Supplementary materials are available for this article.

Although fluorescence dyes or genetically encoded biosensors have been developed, CL is still used due to its high sensitivity, ease of use, and low cost. While initially established and used to measure high levels of ROS in phagocytic cells, CL assays are not ideal for measuring low levels of ROS. Here, we developed a newly modified CL assay using a chemiluminescent imaging system for measuring low concentrations of ROS in nonphagocytic cells. We found that dissolving luminol in NaOH, rather than DMSO, increased the HO-induced CL signal and that the addition of 4-iodophenylboronic acid (4IPBA) further increased CL intensity. Our new system also increased the rate and intensity of the CL signal in phorbol 12-myristate 13-- (PMA-) treated HT-29  cells compared to those in luminol only. We were able to quantify ROS levels from both cells and media in parallel using an HO standard. A significant benefit to our system is that we can easily measure stimulus-induced ROS formation in a real-time manner and also investigate intracellular signaling pathways from a single sample simultaneously. We found that PMA induced tyrosine phosphorylation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), protein tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2), and Src, and increased actin stress fiber formation in a ROS-dependent manner. Interestingly, treatment with either N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) reduced the PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of these PTKs, implicating a potential role in cellular ROS signaling. Thus, our newly optimized CL assay using 4IPBA and a chemiluminescent imaging method provides a simple, real-time, and low-cost method for the quantification of low levels of ROS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27240338>Preparative Purification of Anti-Proliferative Diarylheptanoids from Betula platyphylla by High-Speed Counter-Current Chromatography.</a></h2><p>A simple and rapid method using high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC), along with bioassay-guided fractionation based on the anti-proliferative activity against renal and  cells, has been developed for the preparative separation of aceroside VIII (1) and platyphylloside (2) from Betula platyphylla.

We established an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) method, equipped with hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) column coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for the simultaneous determination of 19 amino acids and 2 related derivatives in human cell lines. Chromatographic separation was achieved within 20min using a BEH amide column, with aqueous mobile phase containing 20mM ammonium  and 20mM ammonium hydroxide, and acetonitrile as the organic mobile phase. Amino acids were analyzed in positive ion multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode without the need of derivatization. Intra- and inter-day precisions were less than 13.7%. The method was successfully applied to simultaneously detect the 21 compounds in a human  cell line DLD1. Moreover, metabolite fate of glutamine-derived carbons into amino acids in DLD1 cells was successfully traced by using [U-C] glutamine as the isotope tracer. Metabolic consequences of glutaminolysis inhibition on amino acid metabolism were evaluated. Analysis of C- and U-C-labeled amino acids revealed the significantly decreased incorporation of [U-C]-glutamine derived carbons into aspartate, alanine and ornithine, indicating impaired metabolic flux via the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the urea cycle.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that ATRA inhibited colorectal  cells RKO (human  adenocarcinoma cell) migration by downregulating cell movement and increasing cell adhesion. ATRA inhibited the expression and activation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in RKO cells, while the expression level of MLC phosphatase (MLCP) had no change in RKO cells treated with or without ATRA. The expression and activity of MLC was also inhibited in RKO cells exposed to ATRA. Intriguingly, ATRA increased the expression of occludin messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein and its localization on cell membrane. However, ATRA did not change the expression of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), but increased the accumulation of ZO-1 on RKO cells membrane. ML-7, an inhibitor of MLCK, significantly inhibited RKO cell migration. Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous MLCK expression inhibited RKO migration. Mechanistically, we showed that MAPK-specific inhibitor PD98059 enhanced the inhibitory effect of ATRA on RKO migration. In contrast, phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) attenuated the effects of ATRA in RKO cells. Moreover, knocking down endogenous extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) expression inhibited MLCK expression in the RKO cells. In conclusion, ATRA inhibits RKO migration by reducing MLCK expression via extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/Mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/MAPK) signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30525244>Esculentoside H inhibits  cell migration and growth through suppression of MMP-9 gene expression via NF-kB signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>A water-soluble saponin, Esculentoside H (EsH), 3-O-(O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-β-d-xylopyranosyl)-28-β-d-glucopyranosylphytolaccagenin has been isolated and purified from the root extract of perennial plant Phytolacca esculenta. EsH is known to be an anticancer compound, having a capacity for TNF-α release. However, the effects of EsH on migration and growth in tumor cells have not yet been reported. In the current study, the suppressive effects of EsH on phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA)-induced cell migration were examined in murine  CT26 cells and human  HCT116 cells. Interestingly, the transwell assay and wound healing show that EsH suppresses the PMA-induced migration and growth potential of HCT116 and CT26  cells, respectively. EsH dose-dependently suppressed matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) expression that was upregulated upon PMA treatment in messenger RNA levels and protein secretion. Since the expression of MMP-9 is correlated with nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling, it has been examined whether EsH inhibits PMA-induced IκB phosphorylation that leads to the suppression of NK-κB nuclear translocation. EsH repressed the phosphorylation level of JNK, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 signaling when the cells were treated with PMA. Overall, these results demonstrated that EsH could suppress  migration through blockage of the JNK1/2 and NF-κB signaling-mediated MMP-9 expression.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26562762>A deterministic oscillatory model of microtubule growth and shrinkage for differential actions of short chain fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Short chain fatty acids (SCFA), principally , propionate, butyrate and valerate, are produced in pharmacologically relevant concentrations by the gut microbiome. Investigations indicate that they exert beneficial effects on  epithelia. There is increasing interest in whether different SCFAs have distinct functions which may be exploited for prevention or treatment of  diseases including colorectal  (CRC), inflammatory bowel disease and obesity. Based on experimental evidence, we hypothesised that odd-chain SCFAs may possess anti-mitotic capabilities in  cells by disrupting microtubule (MT) structural integrity via dysregulation of β-tubulin isotypes. MT dynamic instability is an essential characteristic of MT cellular activity. We report a minimal deterministic model that takes a novel approach to explore the hypothesised pathway by triggering spontaneous oscillations to represent MT dynamic behaviour. The dynamicity parameters in silico were compared to those reported in vitro. Simulations of untreated and butyrate (even-chain length) treated cells reflected MT behaviour in interphase or untreated control cells. The propionate and valerate (odd-chain length) simulations displayed increased catastrophe frequencies and longer periods of MT-fibre shrinkage. Their enhanced dynamicity was dissimilar to that observed in mitotic cells, but parallel to that induced by MT-destabilisation treatments. Antimicrotubule drugs act through upward or downward modulation of MT dynamic instability. Our computational modelling suggests that metabolic engineering of the microbiome may facilitate managing CRC risk by predicting outcomes of SCFA treatments in combination with AMDs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28114805>Change in Caco-2 cells following treatment with various lavender essential oils.</a></h2><p>Lavender is an aromatic evergreen shrub diffused in the Mediterranean basin appreciated since antiquity. The genus Lavandula is part of Lamiaceae family and includes more than 20 species, among which true lavender (L. vera D.C. or L. angustifolia Miller.) and spike lavender (L. latifolia Medikus); there are also numerous hybrids known as lavandins (L. hybrida Rev.). L. vera, spike lavender and several hybrids are the most intensely used breeding species for the production of essential oils. Lavender and lavandin essential oils have been applied in food, pharmaceutical and other agro industries as biological products. In their chemical composition, terpenes linalool and linalyl  along with terpenoids such as 1,8-cineole are mostly responsible for biological and therapeutic activities. This study evaluates cytotoxic activity of essential oils derived from four lavender species on human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells.

Ethanol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH), catalase or cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) to acetaldehyde, which is then further oxidized to  by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Acetaldehyde has been classified by the International Agency for Research on  (IARC) as a Group 1 carcinogen to humans. The acetaldehyde level in the stomach and  is locally influenced by gastric colonization by  or  microbes, as well as polymorphisms in the genes encoding tissue alcohol metabolizing enzymes, especially ALDH2. Alcohol stimulates the uptake of carcinogens and their metabolism and also changes the composition of enteric microbes in a way to enhance the aldehyde level. Alcohol also undergoes chemical coupling to membrane phospholipids and disrupts organization of tight junctions, leading to nuclear translocation of β-catenin and ZONAB, which may contributes to regulation of genes involved in proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Alcohol also generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) by suppressing the expression of antioxidant and cytoprotective enzymes and inducing expression of CYP2E1 which contribute to the metabolic activation of chemical carcinogens. Besides exerting genotoxic effects by directly damaging DNA, ROS can activates signaling molecules involved in inflammation, metastasis and angiogenesis. In addition, alcohol consumption induces folate deficiency, which may result in aberrant DNA methylation profiles, thereby influencing -related gene expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29303970>Cytotoxic Effects and Anti-Angiogenesis Potential of Pistachio (Pistacia vera L.)

The current study was designed to evaluate the anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic potentials of PVLH extracts. The cytotoxic effects of hexane, ethyl , methanol, and water PVLH extracts toward human  (HT-29 and HCT-116), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), lung adenocarcinoma (H23), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), cervical  (Ca Ski), and normal fibroblast (BJ-5ta) cells were assessed using a MTT cell viability assay. Apoptosis induction was evaluated through the different nuclear staining assays and confirmed by flow cytometry analysis. Anti-angiogenic activities were also determined using chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. PVLH ethyl  extracts (PVLH-EAE) demonstrated a suppressive effect with an IC value of 21.20 ± 1.35, 23.00 ± 1.2 and 25.15 ± 1.85 µg/mL against MCF-7, HT-29 and HCT-116, respectively, after 72 h of treatment. Morphological assessment and flow cytometry analysis showed the potential of PVLH-EAE to induce apoptosis. PVLH-EAE at the highest concentration demonstrated significant inhibition of angiogenesis as comparing with control group. Also the expression of Bax increased and the expression of Bcl-2 decreased in treated MCF-7 cells. Thus, the apoptosis induction and angiogenesis potential of PVLH-EAE make it to be the most suitable for further  research study to deal with selective antitumor active substances to human cancers especially breast .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480498>Qualitative Chemical Characterization and Multidirectional Biological Investigation of Leaves and Bark Extracts of  (DC.)

Based on the published literature, there has been no attempt to conduct a comparative assessment of the biological activity and the phytochemical profiles of the leaves and stem bark of  extracted using methanol, ethyl , and water. By high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-ESI-MS) analysis, quinic, shikimic, gallic, and protocatechuic acids were tentatively identified from all the extracts, while chlorogenic, caffeic, ferulic, and dodecanedioic acids were only characterised from the leaves extracts. Additionally, a pharmacological study was carried out to evaluate potential protective effects that are induced by the extracts in rat  and  HCT116 cell line. In general, the methanol and water extracts of  leaves and stem bark showed potent radical scavenging and reducing properties. It was noted that the stem bark extracts were more potent antioxidants as compared to the leaves extracts. The methanol extract of  leaves showed the highest acetyl (4.68 mg galantamine equivalent/g) and butyryl (4.0 mg galantamine equivalent/g) cholinesterase inhibition. Among ethyl  extracts, the pharmacological investigation suggested stem bark ethyl  extracts to be the most promising. This extract revealed ability to protect rat  from lipopolysaccharide-induced oxidative stress, without exerting promoting effects on HCT116 cell line viability and migration.

Accumulating epidemiological and experimental evidences suggest that intake of high protein diet (HPD) is associated with colitis-associated , however, most of the studies were confined in . Systemic influence of HPD on inflammation indices in different tissues of an organism has never been studied. We therefore investigated the effect of HPD on mouse skin and  inflammation using the well characterized inflammation induction protocol in both tissues (12--tetradecanoylphorbol-13- [TPA] for skin and dextran sodium sulfate [DSS] for ). ICR mice were grouped to normal diet (ND, 20% casein) or HPD (50% casein) groups. In each diet group, mice were treated with either vehicle (acetone or HO), TPA, TPA and DSS, or DSS. Experimental diet was fed for total 4 weeks. After 1 week of diet feeding, 6.5 nmol of TPA was topically applied twice a week for 2 weeks on the shaved mouse dorsal skin. Drinking water containing 2% DSS was administered for 7 days at the final week of experiment. The results showed that TPA-induced skin hyperplasia, epidermal cell proliferation, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression were reduced in HPD group compared to ND group. In contrast, HPD increased DSS-induced  mucosal hyperplasia, colonocyte proliferation, COX-2 expression, and plasma nitric oxide compared to ND group. This suggests that HPD exerts differential effect on different tissue inflammation which implies efficacy of protein intervention to human also should be monitored more thoroughly.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29269607>Identification and Characterization of a Novel NADPH Oxidase 1 (Nox1) Inhibitor That Suppresses Proliferation of  and Stomach  Cells.</a></h2><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (Nox)1 mediate cellular signalings involved in normal physiological processes, and aberrant control of Nox1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases. Therefore, Nox1 could have great potential as a therapeutic target. Here, we identified a novel Nox1 inhibitor, NOS31 secreted from Stretomyces sp. and analyzed its chemical structure. Furthermore, NOS31 was found to selectively inhibit Nox1-mediated ROS generation, with only a marginal effect on other Nox isoforms (Nox2-5) and no ROS scavenging activity. This compound blocked both Nox organizer 1 (NOXO1)/Nox activator 1 (NOXA1)-dependent and phorbol 12-myristate 13--stimulated Nox1-mediated ROS production in  cells. NOS31 inhibited the proliferation of several  carcinoma and gastric  cell lines that upregulate the Nox1 system, whereas it had no appreciable effect on normal cells with low levels of Nox1. The finding suggests that NOS31 is a unique, potent Nox1 inhibitor of microbial origin and raises its possibility as a therapeutic agent for inhibiting gastrointestinal  cell growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742104>Apoptosis induction in  cell lines and alteration of aberrant crypt foci in rat  by purple rice (Oryza sativa L. var. glutinosa) extracts.</a></h2><p>Crude ethanol extracts (CEE) of purple rice was fractionated to obtain hexane soluble (HSF) and ethyl  soluble fractions (EASF). Total antioxidant capacity was higher in CEE than the HSF and EASF. However, HSF exhibited strong antiproliferation and apoptosis induction against  cell lines, both p53 wild-type (RKO) and mutant (SW620) strains. Then, the CEE was used to determine the effects on the progression of aberrant crypt foci (ACF), a preneoplastic lesion seen in  carcinogenesis in rats. Male Wistar rats were subcutaneously injected of 40 mg/kg body weight dimethylhydrazin (DMH) once weekly for 2 wk. After 2 wk, rats were orally administered ethanol extract at 100 and 1000 mg/kg body weight, for 4 wk. Rats fed with only the high dose of CEE had significantly decreased numbers of ACF per rat (45.56%) and crypt multiplicity (AC/focus) (16.67%) compared to rats that received DMH alone. The result also demonstrated that CEE induced apoptosis in  epithelium cells of rat received  carcinogen as detected the increasing of caspase-3 activity.

Research has shown that dietary fibre mixtures may be more beneficial for colorectal  prevention than a single dietary fibre type. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of green cincau extract on short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in anaerobic batch cultures inoculated with human faecal slurries and to compare these to results obtained using different dietary fibre types (pectin, inulin, and cellulose), singly and in combination. Furthermore, fermentation supernatants (FSs) were evaluated in Caco-2 cells for their effect on cell viability, differentiation, and apoptosis. Cincau increased total SCFA concentration by increasing  and propionate, but not butyrate concentration. FSs from all dietary fibre sources, including cincau, reduced Caco-2 cell viability. However, the effects of all FSs on cell viability, cell differentiation, and apoptosis were not simply explainable by their butyrate content. In conclusion, products of fermentation of cincau extracts induced cell death, but further work is required to understand the mechanism of action.

In the current study, methanolic crude extracts and various fractions of  eggs extracted in other solvents were tested for effects on cell viability of human colorectal  cells (HCT116) and melanoma cells (B16F10) using an MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. A methanolic crude extract of eggs was obtained by cold maceration, followed by fractionation to obtain hexane, chloroform, ethyl , n-butanol, and aqueous fractions. The methanolic crude extract decreased cell viability of HCT-116 and B16F10 cell lines at higher concentrations. The other fractions were evaluated using a cell viability assay, and chloroform and hexane showed the highest activity at significantly lower concentrations than did the methanolic fraction. Full scan profiles of the methanolic crude extract and the chloroform and hexane fractions were obtained by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the resultant compounds were identified by comparing their spectral data to those available in spectral matching libraries. ROS generation assay, flow cytometry, and western blot analysis provided supporting evidence that the hexane and chloroform fractions induced cell death in HCT116 and B16-F10 cell lines. All fractions were further tested for antibacterial activity against , among which the hexane fraction showed the highest zone of inhibition on LB nutrient agar plates.

However, the comprehensive and holistic effects of its bioactive fractions for various antitumor therapeutic effects have not been unraveled. This is the first study to scientifically elucidate the holistic effect of Chinese medicine formula for treating , hence allowing a better understanding of the essence of Chinese medicine formula, through the comparison of the actions of TXL and its functional constituent fractions, including ethyl  (EA), butanol (BU), and aqueous (WA) fractions. Tissue-specific proliferative/antiproliferative effects of these fractions on human colorectal carcinoma HT-29 cells and splenocytes were studied by using the MTT assay. Their modulations on the expression of markers of antiproliferation, antimetastasis, reversion of multidrug resistance in treated HT-29 cells were examined with real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, and their modulations in a xenografted nude mouse model were examined by Western blot analysis. Results revealed that EA fraction slightly inhibited the proliferation of HT-29 cells, but tissue-specifically exerted the most potent antiproliferative effect on splenocytes. On the contrary, only TXL and BU fraction tissue-specifically contributed to the proliferation of splenocytes, but inhibited the proliferation of HT-29 cells. WA fraction exerted the most potent antiproliferative effect on HT-29 cells and also the strongest inhibitory action on tumor size in the nude mouse model in our previous study. In the HT-29 model, TXL and WA fraction exerted the most pronounced effect on upregulation of p21 mRNA and protein; TXL, and EA and WA fractions exerted the effect on downregulation of G1 phase cell cycle protein, cyclin D1 mRNA and protein; EA and BU fractions exerted the most prominent anti-invasive effect on anti-invasion via downregulation of MMP-1 mRNA; TXL potently reversed most multidrug resistance via downregulation of MDR-1 protein. In conclusion, the comprehensive and holistic effects of TXL were demonstrated with ( a) mutual accentuation and mutual enhancement, ( b) mutual counteraction and mutual suppression, and ( c) mutual antagonism among the 3 constituent fractions.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to measure mRNA and protein levels, respectively. siRNA transfection was used to assess involvement of genes in  invasion, which were identified by Matrigel transwell invasion assay. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to identify transcription factors linked to gene expression.Under basal conditions, less invasive human  cells (HT29 and Caco-2) showed low MMP-7 expression but high NOX1 expression and AMPK phosphorylation. Treatment of HT29 and Caco-2 cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA) induced an invasive phenotype response along with corresponding increases in ROS production and NOX2 and MMP-7 expression as well as reduced AMPK phosphorylation, which resemble basal conditions of highly invasive human  cells (SW620 and HCT116). In addition, inverse regulation between AMPK phosphorylation and NOX2 and MMP-7 expression was observed in HT29 cells treated with different concentrations of exogenous hydrogen peroxide. TPA-induced invasive phenotype in HT29 cells was abolished by treatment with Vit. E, DPI, apocynin, and NOX2 siRNA but not NOX1 siRNA, indicating NOX2-derived ROS production induced an invasive phenotype. TPA-induced induction of MMP-7 expression was suppressed by AP-1, NF-κB, and MAPK (ERK, p38, and JNK) inhibitors, whereas TPA-induced expression of NOX2 and its regulators, p47phox and p67phox, was blocked by p38 and NF-κB inhibitors.Molecular switch from NOX1 to NOX2 in  cells induces ROS production and subsequently enhances MMP-7 expression by deactivating AMPK, which otherwise inhibits stimulus-induced autoregulation of ROS and NOX2 gene expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26941530>Crude Extracts of Marine-derived and Soil Fungi of the Genus Neosartorya Exhibit Selective Anticancer Activity by Inducing Cell Death in , Breast and Skin  Cell Lines.</a></h2><p>The crude ethyl  extracts of marine-derived fungi Neosartorya tsunodae KUFC 9213 (E1) and N. laciniosa KUFC 7896 (E2), and soil fungus N. fischeri KUFC 6344 (E3) were evaluated for their in vitro anticancer activities on a panel of seven human  cell lines.The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was performed, after 48 h treatments with different concentrations of extracts, to determine their concentration of the extract or Dox that inhibits cell viability by 50% for each cell line. The effects of the crude extracts on DNA damage, clonogenic potential and their ability to induce cell death were also assessed.E1 was found to the void of anti-proliferative effects. E2 was shown to decrease the clonogenic potential in human colorectal carcinoma cell line (HCT116), human malignant melanoma cell line (A375), human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF7), and human caucasian  adenocarcinoma Grade II cell line (HT29) cells, whereas E3 showed such effect only in HCT116 and MCF7 cells. Both extracts were found to increase DNA damage in some cell lines. E2 was found to induce cell death in HT29, HCT116, MCF7, and A375 cells while extract E3 increased cell death in MCF7 and HCT116 cell lines.The results reveal that E2 and E3 possess anticancer activities in human  carcinoma, breast adenocarcinoma, and melanoma cells, validating the interest for an identification of molecular targets involved in the anticancer activity.The crude ethyl  extract of N. tsunodae (E1) did not decrease cell viability in any of the tested cell linesThe crude ethyl  extracts of N. laciniosa (E2) and N. fischeri (E3) decreased cell proliferation in some human  cell lines tested at both short- and long-termN. laciniosa (E2) induced a significant increase in the number of cell death, in part, due to the induction of DNA damageN. fischeri (E3) induce cell death but in some cell lines without induction of DNA damage detected by comet assayCrude ethyl extracts of N. laciniosa (E2) and N. fischeri (E3) exert an anticancer activity in human  carcinoma, breast adenocarcinoma, and malignant melanoma cells.

The limitations of cisplatin-based chemotherapy have prompted intense interest among scientists to search for alternative metal-based anticancer medicines. Gold(III) complexes have been among the most widely investigated since they showed higher cytotoxicity than cisplatin and promising in vitro and in vivo anticancer activities in CRC but their clinical usefulness has been limited by their poor stability under physiological conditions. A novel gold(III) porphyrin complexes [gold(III) porphyrin-adamantane chloride (SN1) and gold(III) porphyrin mono- chloride (SN2)] with improved aqueous stability were synthesized. SN1 and SN2 reduced the survival of human CRC HT-29 and HCT-116 cell lines, caused cell cycle arrest in G/M phase, and we observed downregulation of the expression of cyclin B1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) along with up-regulation of the active form of p53, p21 and Bcl-2-associated X (Bax). Furthermore, SN1 and SN2 induced apoptosis by the intrinsic pathway, since they lead to the cleavage of caspase 9, caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and up-regulating Bax. Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) are important for cell survival and proliferation. SN1 and SN2 lead to decrease in the activity of Akt where the phosphorylated form decreased with time as well as they caused an important decrease in the phosphorylation of ERK and activity of NF-κB. Finally, SN1 and SN2 complexes affected p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway then we recorded an increase in the cyclooxygenase-2 expression and its enzymatic product prostaglandin E.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This compound was tested on the HT-29 human  adenocarcinoma cell line using MTT (method of transcriptional and translational) cell proliferation assay. The results of MTT assay showed that DMHE exhibited good cytotoxic effect on HT-29 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner but no cytotoxic effect on the MRC-5 cell line after 72 h incubation. Morphological features of apoptotic cells upon treatment by DMHE, e.g., cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing, were examined by an inverted and phase microscope. Other features, such as chromatin condension and nuclear fragmentation were studied using acridine orange and propidium iodide staining under the fluorescence microscope.

They can used as initial compounds for synthesis of several heterocyclic compounds. The compounds with the backbone of chalcones have been reported to possess various biological activities.Pyridine and thioamide derivatives were obtained from the reaction of 3-(furan-2-yl)-1-(p-tolyl)prop-2-en-1-one with the appropriate amount of malononitrile, benzoylacetonitrile, ethyl cyanoacetate and thiosemicarbazide in the presence of ammonium . The reaction of 3,5-di(furan-2-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carbothioamide with ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate, 3-chloropentane-2,4-dione or ethyl chloroacetate produced thiazole derivatives. Pyrano[2,3-d]thiazole derivatives were obtained as well from thiazolone to arylidene malononitrile. The structures of the title compounds were clarified by elemental analyses, and FTIR, MS and NMR spectra. Some compounds were screened against various microorganisms (i.e., bacteria +ve, bacteria -ve and fungi).

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and matrix metalloproteinase‑9 (MMP-9) are highly expressed in various cancers, such as , lung and breast , and enhance cell migration and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, the effects of proton beam irradiation on COX-2 and MMP-9 expression levels in MDA-MB‑231 human breast  cells were investigated, along with the signaling pathway involved in the proton beam irradiation‑mediated antimetastatic effect. The results revealed that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13‑‑induced increases in COX-2 and MMP-9 expression levels were reversed by proton beam irradiation in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, proton beam irradiation inhibited phosphorylation of protein kinase B (also known as Akt) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which are activated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) stimulation. MMP-9 and COX-2 expression levels are regulated by PI3K/Akt and/or protein kinase C/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways that enhance NF-κB and activator protein-1 transcriptional activities. Therefore, the results suggest that proton beam irradiation inhibited the  cell growth and metastasis associated with COX-2 and MMP-9 expression in MDA-MB‑231 human breast  cells, and that the antimetastatic effect of proton beam irradiation is achieved by the suppression of NF-κB phosphorylation via inhibition of Akt activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24212079>Total alkaloids of Tripterygium hypoglaucum (levl.)

To evaluate the in vitro and in vivo antitumor properties of the total alkaloids of THH (THHta).THHta was extracted in pilot-scale. HCT116 cells were chose to establish human  xenograft model. The in vitro anti-tumor activity of THHta was tested by Cell malignant transformation test, Soft agar colony formation assay and MTT assay. The in vivo anti-tumor effect of THHta was confirmed by xenograft mouse model. THHta-induced apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. The levels of apoptosis-related proteins were investigated by Western blot.TPA-induced cell transformation was significantly inhibited by THHta in JB6 Cl41 cells. THHta inhibits the growth of  cells in vitro in a significant dose-dependent manner. Compared to the control set, i.p. administration of THHta to xenograft mice signiﬁcantly reduced both tumor weight and volume. Apoptosis induction of THHta was mediated by activation of caspase-3, PARP and inhibiting of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and XIAP.THHta was effective in inhibiting tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo at less toxic concentrations by inducing apoptosis which suggested it could be developed as a potential anticancer agent.© 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this study, the antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of the crude aqueous methanol and fractionated extracts of Alpinia pahangensis against five different  and one normal cell lines were investigated. The total phenolic content of each extract and its fractions were also quantified. This is the first report on the antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of Alpinia pahangensis extract.In the current study, the crude methanol and fractionated extract of the rhizomes of Alpinia pahangensis were investigated for their antioxidant activity using four different assays namely, the DPPH scavenging activity, superoxide anion scavenging, β-carotene bleaching and reducing power assays whilst their phenolic contents were measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu's method.In vitro neutral red cytotoxicity assay was employed to evaluate the cytotoxic activity against five different  cell lines,  (HCT 116 and HT-29), cervical  (Ca Ski), breast  (MCF7) and lung  (A549) cell lines, and one normal cell line (MRC-5). The extract that showed high cytotoxic activity was further investigated for its chemical constituents by GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) analysis.The ethyl  fraction showed the strongest DPPH radical scavenging (0.35 ± 0.094 mg/ml) and SOD activities (51.77 ± 4.9%) whilst the methanol extract showed the highest reducing power and also the strongest antioxidant activity in the β-carotene bleaching assays in comparison to other fractions. The highest phenolic content was found in the ethyl  fraction, followed by the crude methanol extract, hexane and water fractions. The results showed a positive correlation between total phenolic content with DPPH radical scavenging capacities and SOD activities. The hexane fraction showed potent cytotoxic effect against KB, Ca Ski and HCT 116 cell lines with IC₅₀ of 5.8 ± 0.1 and 9.1 ± 2.0 ug/ml, respectively. The major components of hexane fraction analysed by GC-MS analysis were mostly methyl esters.The current study suggests that the methanol extract and ethyl  fraction of A. pahangensis is a potential source of natural antioxidant for protective as well as prevention of life-threatening diseases.

Therefore, radioprotective measures, against both acute and chronic biological effects of radiation, require frequent intake of nontoxic natural products, which have practical oral administration. The goal of this study was to characterize the radioprotective, radiomitigative and radiation-induced bystander effect-inhibiting properties of endogenous metabolites: phenylacetate, ursodeoxycholate and tauroursodeoxycholate. Compounds were administered pre- and postirradiation as well as in donor and recipient bystander flasks to analyze whether these might adequately protect against radiation injury as well as facilitate recovery from the exposures. The clonogenic HCT116 p53 wild-type  cell line in this study shares characteristics of stem cells, such as high reproductive viability, which is an effective marker to demonstrate compound effectiveness. Clonogenic assays were therefore used to characterize radioprotective, radiomitigative and bystander inhibiting properties of treatment compounds whereby cellular responses to radiation were quantified with macroscopic colony counts to measure cell survival in flasks. The results were statistically significant for phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate when administered preirradiation, conferring radioprotection up to 2 Gy, whereas administration postirradiation and in bystander experiments did not confer radioprotection . These findings suggest that phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate might be effective radioprotectors, although they possess no radiomitigative properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26771233>The probiotic Propionibacterium freudenreichii as a new adjuvant for TRAIL-based therapy in colorectal .</a></h2><p>TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) is a well-known apoptosis inducer, which activates the extrinsic death pathway. TRAIL is pro-apoptotic on  cells, while not cytotoxic towards normal healthy cells. However, its clinical use is limited by cell resistance to cell death which occurs in approximately 50% of  cells. Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA) are also known to specifically induce apoptosis of  cells. In accordance, we have shown that food grade dairy propionibacteria induce intrinsic apoptosis of  cells, via the production and release of SCFA (propionate and ) acting on mitochondria. Here, we investigated possible synergistic effect between Propionibacterium freudenreichii and TRAIL. Indeed, we hypothesized that acting on both extrinsic and intrinsic death pathways may exert a synergistic pro-apoptotic effect. Whole transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that propionibacterial supernatant or propionibacterial metabolites (propionate and ), in combination with TRAIL, increased pro-apoptotic gene expression (TRAIL-R2/DR5) and decreased anti-apoptotic gene expression (FLIP, XIAP) in HT29 human  cells. The revealed synergistic pro-apoptotic effect, depending on both death receptors (TRAIL-R1/DR4, TRAIL-R2/DR5) and caspases (caspase-8, -9 and -3) activation, was lethal on  cells but not on normal human intestinal epithelial cells (HIEC), and was inhibited by Bcl-2 expression. Finally, milk fermented by P. freudenreichii induced HT29 cells apoptosis and enhanced TRAIL cytotoxic activity, as did P. freudenreichii DMEM culture supernatants or its SCFA metabolites. These results open new perspectives for food grade P. freudenreichii-containing products in order to potentiate TRAIL-based  therapy in colorectal .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29745075>Geraniol and geranyl  induce potent anticancer effects in  Colo-205 cells by inducing apoptosis, DNA damage and cell cycle arrest.</a></h2><p> ranks second in mortality among all human malignancies, creating thus a need for exploration of novel molecules that would prove effective, cost-effective and with lower toxicity. In the recent past monoterpenes have gained tremendous attention for their anticancer activity. In the present study we evaluated the anticancer effects of two important monoterpenes, geraniol and geranyl  against colo-205  cells.The antiproliferative activity was determined by MTT assay. Apoptosis was assessed by DAPI staining and DNA damage was checked by comet assay. The cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry and protein expression was examined by western blotting.The results showed that both geraniol and geranyl  exhibited significant anticancer activity against colo-205  cell line with IC50 values of 20 and 30 μM respectively. To find out the underlying mechanism, DAPI staining was carried out and it was observed that both the monoterpenes, geraniol and geranyl , induced apoptosis in colo-205 cells. The apoptosis was also associated with upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2 expressions, indicative of mitochondrial apoptosis. Moreover, these two monoterpenes could trigger DNA damage and G2/M cell cycle arrest in colo-205 cells.Taken together, we propose that geraniol and geranyl  may prove to be important lead molecular candidates for the treatment of .

An MTT assay was performed to measure the cytotoxicity of these two extracts on the H460 lung  and the Caco-2  cell lines. An elastase assay kit, based on the digestion of a non-fluorescent elastin substrate to highly fluorescent fragments by elastase, was used for the elastase inhibition assay. Tyrosinase inhibition activity was investigated using the dopachrome method with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) as a substrate. The data obtained in this study demonstrated that the extracts were nontoxic to H460 and Caco-2 cell lines. The elastase inhibition activities of ethanol (250 μg/ml) and ethyl  (125 μg/ml) extracts were found to be significantly higher than that of the negative control. The tyrosinase inhibition activities of ethanol and ethyl  extracts, in terms of the mean inhibition concentration (IC), were 1,078 and 1,467 μg/ml, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the present study has demonstrated for the first time that marigold flower extracts possess tyrosinase inhibition activity.

The cytotoxic activity of 1 and 2 was reduced in the presence of the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and Mn(III) Tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin pentachloride (MnTMPyP), therefore suggesting that reactive oxygen species generation participates in the cytotoxic activity of these dihydrochalcones.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345579>Bioactives in cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) stems possess potent antioxidant and pro-apoptotic activities through COX-2 involvement.</a></h2><p>Bioactives extracted from cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) stems were investigated for their chemopreventive activities using human  cells in vitro. The bioactives present in crude extracts were detected and quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography.Among all the extracts, such as hexane, ethyl  (EtOAc), acetone, methanol (MeOH), and MeOH:water (80:20), the MeOH extract had the highest amount of polyphenolic compounds and the acetone extract exhibited the most potent effect at scavenging the 2,2,-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS(•+) ) radical. In addition, most of the extracts, with the exception of hexane, exhibited significant cytotoxicity in human SW480  and MCF7 breast  cells. Overall, the SW480 cells were more sensitive than the MCF7 cells to the cytotoxic effect of the O. ficus-indica extracts (OFEs). Cell death by OFE treatment caused significant inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 and increased the Bax/Bcl2 ratio in both SW480 and MCF7 cell lines. However, degradation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase was significantly increased by OFE only in the MCF7 cells, thereby inducing apoptosis.These findings demonstrate the health-benefit roles, including anti-oxidative and anti-proliferative activities as well as pro-apoptotic effects, of bioactive compounds in OFEs, suggesting a chemopreventive role in human  cells.© 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23957353>Antrodia camphorata grown on germinated brown rice inhibits HT-29 human  carcinoma proliferation through inducing G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis by targeting the β-catenin signaling.</a></h2><p>Antrodia camphorata (AC) has been used as a traditional medicine to treat food and drug intoxication, diarrhea, abdominal pain, hypertension, pruritis (skin itch), and liver  in East Asia. In this study, we investigated anticancer activities of AC grown on germinated brown rice (CBR) in HT-29 human  cells. We found that the inhibitory efficacy of CBR 80% ethanol (EtOH) extract on HT-29 and CT-26 cell proliferation was more effective than ordinary AC EtOH 80% extract. Next, 80% EtOH extract of CBR was further separated into four fractions; hexane, ethyl  (EtOAc), butanol (BuOH), and water. Among them, CBR EtOAc fraction showed the strongest inhibitory activity against HT-29 cell proliferation. Therefore, CBR EtOAc fraction was chosen for further studies. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining data indicated that CBR EtOAc fraction induced apoptosis. Induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest on human  carcinoma cell was observed in CBR EtOAc fraction-treated cells. We found that CBR decreased the level of proteins involved in G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. CBR EtOAc fraction inhibited the β-catenin signaling pathway, supporting its suppressive activity on the level of cyclin D1. High performance liquid chromatography analysis data indicated that CBR EtOAc fraction contained adenosine. This is the first investigation that CBR has a greater potential as a novel chemopreventive agent than AC against .

Saponins are a natural soapy constituent found within plants. A 2012 study suggested that saponins may be present in jewelweed which could be responsible for its efficacy in preventing rash development following contact with Toxicodendron radicans (L.) Kuntze (poison ivy). This study validated this hypothesis and demonstrated additional biological activity of the jewelweed saponin containing extract.Fresh I. capensis leaves were extracted with methanol and further partitioned between ethyl  and water, with a final separation between water and n-butanol, to obtain a saponin containing extract. The presence of saponins in the extract was demonstrated by the observation of foaming and using a vanillin colorimetric assay for total saponins. Efficacy of the saponin containing extracts in rash reduction was tested by brushing poison ivy (PI) onto the forearms of volunteers (N=23) in six locations and treating these PI exposed areas with distilled water (control), saponin containing extracts, fresh plant mashes, and soaps made with and without plant extracts. Saponin containing extracts were further tested for biological activity against both gram negative and gram positive bacteria and against  cell lines A-375, HT-29, and MCF-7. Additionally, because saponins have been shown to have a stimulatory effect in cardiac muscle 2 µl saponin extract was applied superficially to black worms, Lumbriculus variegatus (N=5).Both saponin containing extracts and all soaps tested were effective in reducing poison ivy dermatitis; thus, saponin content correlates with PI rash prevention. No apparent antibiosis was observed against any bacteria tested; however, dose response cytotoxicity was documented against MCF-7 breast  cells and cytostatic activity was seen against the HT-29  cell lines. Lumbriculus variegatus exhibited a 138% increase in heart rate over baseline rate five minutes post treatment implying a possible positive chronotropic effect.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The substances were characterized mainly by spectroscopic methods (¹H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, DEPT-45, DEPT-90, DEPT-135, 2D-NMR). In our study, a new specific thin layer chromatographic method was developed for determination of ergosterol and ergosterol peroxide in H. aurantiaca extract. The method is based on the separation of n-hexane extract on silica gel (Silica Gel G) TLC plates using the optimized solvent system toluene/ethyl  (3:1; v/v). The main advantages of the developed method are the simplicity of operation and the low cost. The in vitro study results revealed the antiproliferative properties of ergosterol peroxide against LS180 human  cells. The described effect was attributed both to altered mitochondrial activity and decreased DNA synthesis. Additionally, in the same concentration range the investigated compound was not toxic to CCD 841 CoTr human  epithelial cells. The present study suggests that fruit bodies of H. aurantiaca have great potential for producing substances and extracts with potential applications in medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23835448>Design and synthesis of pyrido[3,2-α]carbazole derivatives and their analogues as potent antitumour agents.</a></h2><p>A series of pyrido[3,2-α]carbazole derivatives and their analogues have been prepared and evaluated for their antitumour activity against human lung  A549 cells and  HT29 cells. The intermediates 4a-4k are successfully synthesized from 1a-1k and ethyl 2-(3-bromopyridin-2-yl) by Knoevenagel condensation and intramolecular Heck-type reaction, and this is a novel and efficient synthetic approach to the core scaffold of the target compounds. These target compounds have shown an interesting antitumour profile towards the tested cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 0.07 μM to 4.45 μM. Among all the compounds synthesized, 8 compounds show higher potency than R16, 12 compounds are as potent as R16, and 6 compounds are less potent than R16. The best compound 24 is 7 times and approximately 10 times as potent as R16 against A549 and HT29 cells, respectively.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Short-chain fatty acids influence  health through various mechanisms. In vitro and ex vivo studies show that SCFAs have anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic effects, play an important role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in colonocytes, and protect colonocytes from external harm. Animal studies have found substantial positive effects of SCFAs or dietary fiber on  disease, but convincing evidence in humans is lacking. Most human intervention trials have been conducted in the context of inflammatory bowel disease. Only a limited number of those trials are of high quality, showing little or no favorable effect of SCFA treatment over placebo. Opportunities for future research include exploring the use of combination therapies with anti-inflammatory drugs, prebiotics, or probiotics; the use of prodrugs in the setting of carcinogenesis; or the direct application of SCFAs to improve mucosal healing after  surgery.© The Author(s) 2017.

(LEGE06113) and the Synechocystis salina (LEGE06155) on the RKO  adenocarcinoma cell line.Cytotoxicity was analysed by MTT. Effects on cells were evaluated by mRNA expression of cell cycle and apoptotic genes, flow cytometry (cell cycle), qualitative and quantitative fluorescence microscopy (apoptosis), and quantitative proteomics.IC50 values were 27.01 and 8.03 μg/ml for Cyanobium sp., and 37.71 and 17.17 μg/ml for Synechocystis salina, after 24 h and 48 h, respectively. Exposure to the Cyanobium sp. fraction increased 2.5 fold BCL-2 mRNA expression (p < 0.05), and altered proteins (13, p < 0.05) belonged to apoptosis (PSMA5, PSMA7, TPT1, UBE2K), cell cycle (EIF4E, PCNA), cellular metabolism (AHSG, GLO1, ATP5H, HSP90AB1, NME1, HNRNPC) and cell structure (KRT10). Exposure to the Synechocystis salina fraction decreased 2fold CCNB1 mRNA expression (p < 0.05). Accordingly, flow cytometry demonstrated a decrease of cells in the G0/G1 and S phase (p < 0.05), indicating a cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed a higher level of apoptosis compared to the solvent control group (p < 0.01). Altered proteins (6, p < 0.05) belonged to apoptosis (HSPD1, UBE2K), protein metabolism (PKM, PDIA3) and cell structure (KRT10, KRT1).Since induction of cytotoxicity is a very broad parameter, the study demonstrates the potential of picocyanobacteria to produce bioactive compounds that target  cells via different molecular mechanisms.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

[(18)F]-fluoroacetate ((18)F-FACE) is an [(18)F] fluorinated , which is known to be converted into fatty acids, incorporated in membrane and is expected to be a promising oncologic PET tracer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of (18)F-FACE as an oncologic PET tracer in preclinical study in healthy volunteers and in patients with liver tumors.Twenty-four healthy volunteers (age 48.2 ± 12.9 years old; 15 male and 9 female) and ten patients with liver tumor (age 72.1 ± 7.0 years old; 6 male and 4 female) were included. We performed whole-body static PET/CT scan using (18)F-FACE (n = 34) and (18)F-FDG (n = 5 for volunteers, n = 8 for patients) on each day, respectively. Qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis of tumors (5 HCCs, 1 cholangiocellular carcinoma, 4 metastatic tumors from  and P-NET) were performed using SUVmax and tumor-to-normal liver ratio (TNR).In healthy volunteers, (18)F-FACE was metabolically stable in vivo and its biodistribution was almost similar to blood pool, basically uniformly independent of age and gender during PET scan time (up to 3 h). Normal physiological uptake of (18)F-FACE at each organ including liver (SUVmean 1.8 ± 0.2) was lower than that of blood pool (SUVmean 2.3 ± 0.3) at 1 h after injection. Chronic inflammatory uptake around femur of post-operative state of femoral osteotomy and faint uptake of benign hemangioma were observed in a case of healthy volunteer. (18)F-FACE (SUVmax 2.7 ± 0.6, TNR 1.5 ± 0.4) of liver tumors was significantly lower than those of (18)F-FDG uptake (6.5 ± 4.2, 2.6 ± 1.7, respectively). In qualitative analysis, (18)F-FDG was positive in 4 tumors (3 HCCs, 1 CCC) and negative in the other 6 tumors, while (18)F-FACE was also positive in 4 tumors which were the same tumors with positive (18)F-FDG uptake.Biodistribution of (18)F-FACE was appropriate for oncologic imaging. Tumor (18)F-FACE uptake was positive in four patients with HCC and CCC, but the uptake pattern was similar to (18)F-FDG.

It was established that propolis from T. incisa presented the highest in vitro cytotoxicity against the SW620  cell line (6% cell survival in 20 μg/mL).Propolis from T. incisa was extracted with methanol and further partitioned with n-hexane, ethyl  and methanol. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the extracts was assessed by the MTT assay against human  (SW620), liver (Hep-G2), gastric (KATO-III), lung (Chago) and breast (BT474)  derived cell lines. The active fractions were further enriched by silica gel quick column, absorption and size exclusion chromatography. The purity of each fraction was checked by thin layer chromatography. Cytotoxicity in BT-474 cells induced by cardanol compared to doxorubicin were evaluated by MTT assay, induction of cell cycle arrest and cell death by flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide and annexin-V stained cells.A cardol isomer was found to be the major compound in one active fraction (F45) of T. incisa propolis, with a cytotoxicity against the SW620 (IC50 of 4.51±0.76 μg/mL), KATO-III (IC50 of 6.06±0.39 μg/mL), Hep-G2 (IC50 of 0.71±0.22 μg/mL), Chago I (IC50 of 0.81±0.18 μg/mL) and BT474 (IC50 of 4.28±0.14 μg/mL) cell lines. Early apoptosis (programmed cell death) of SW620 cells was induced by the cardol containing F45 fraction at the IC50 and IC80 concentrations, respectively, within 2-6 h of incubation.

The bioassay-guided fractionation of microbial cultured ethyl  extract of the strain, led to isolation of macrotetrolide compound 1 (Dinactin) and compound 2 (1-(2,4-dihydroxy-6-methylphenyl)-ethanone). Structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated by [corrected] interpretation of NMR and other spectroscopic data including HR-ESI-MS, FT-IR. These compounds are reported for first time from Streptomyces Puniceus. Compound 1 exhibited strong anti-microbial activity against all tested bacterial pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The MIC values of compound 1 against Gram negative and Gram positive bacterial pathogens ranged between 0.019 - 0.156μgml and 1μgml against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Dinactin exhibited marked anti-tumor potential with IC of 1.1- 9.7μM in various human cancerous cell lines and showed least cytotoxicity (IC∼80μM) in normal cells (HEK-293). Dinactin inhabited cellular proliferation in  cells, reduced their clonogenic survival as validated by clonogenic assay and also inhabited cell migration and invasion characteristics in  (HCT-116) cells.

With regard to such muscle loss, despite extensive study in a range of models, there is ongoing debate as to whether a reduction in protein synthesis, an increase in degradation or a combination of both is the more relevant. Each model differs in terms of key mediators and the pathways activated in skeletal muscle. Certain models do suggest that decreased synthesis accompanied by enhanced protein degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP) is important. Murine models tend to involve rapid development of cachexia and may represent more acute muscle atrophy rather than the chronic wasting observed in humans. There is a paucity of human data both at a basic descriptive level and at a molecular/mechanism level. Progress in treating the human form of  cachexia can only move forwards through carefully designed large randomised controlled clinical trials of specific therapies with validated biomarkers of relevance to underlying mechanisms.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of anti-tumor activity for  have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of melatonin on migration in human  RKO cells and the potential molecular mechanisms.The viability of RKO cells was investigated by MTT assay after treatment with melatonin, SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) and phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA, MAPK activator) alone or in combination for 48h. The effects of melatonin, and ML-7, a selective inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), and SB203580, and PMA on the migration of RKO cells were analyzed by in vitro scratch-wound assay. The relative mRNA levels of MLCK was assessed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Western blotting analysis was performed to examine the expression of MLCK, phosphorylation of myosin light chain (pMLC) and p38 (pp38).The proliferation and migration of human  RKO cells were inhibited significantly after treatment with melatonin. The expression levels of MLCK and phosphorylation of MLC of RKO cells were reduced, and real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed that melatonin had significant effects on suppressing the expression of MLCK. Furthermore, the phosphorylation level of p38, which showed the same trend, was also reduced when cells were treated by melatonin. In addition, ML-7 (25umol/l) could down-regulate the phosphorylation of p38.Melatonin could inhibit the proliferation and migration of RKO cells, and further experiments confirmed that p38 MAPK plays an important role in regulating melatonin-induced migration inhibition through down-regulating the expression and activity of MLCK.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25845382>Inhibitory effects of proton beam irradiation on integrin expression and signaling pathway in human  carcinoma HT29 cells.</a></h2><p>Proton radiotherapy has been established as a highly effective modality used in the local control of tumor growth. Although proton radiotherapy is used worldwide to treat several types of  clinically with great success due to superior targeting and energy deposition, the detailed regulatory mechanisms underlying the functions of proton radiation are not yet well understood. Accordingly, in the present study, to assess the effects of proton beam on integrin-mediated signaling pathways, we investigated the expression of integrins related to tumor progression and integrin trafficking, and key molecules related to cell adhesion, as well as examining phosphorylation of signaling molecules involved in integrin-mediated signaling pathways. Proton beam irradiation inhibited the increase in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA)-induced integrin β1 protein expression and the gene expression of members of the integrin family, such as α5β1, α6β4, αvβ3, and αvβ6 in human colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells. Simultaneously, the gene expression of cell adhesion molecules, such as FAK and CDH1, and integrin trafficking regulators, such as RAB4, RAB11, and HAX1, was decreased by proton beam irradiation. Moreover, proton beam irradiation decreased the phosphorylation of key molecules involved in integrin signaling, such as FAK, Src, and p130Cas, as well as PKC and MAPK, which are known as promoters of cell migration, while increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and the gene expression of Rab IP4 involved in the inhibition of cell adhesion and cell spreading. Taken together, our findings suggest that proton beam irradiation can inhibit metastatic potential, including cell adhesion and migration, by modulating the gene expression of molecules involved in integrin trafficking and integrin-mediated signaling, which are necessary for tumor progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28755574>Impact of the Cu(II) ions on the chemical and biological properties of goserelin - coordination pattern, DNA degradation, oxidative reactivity and in vitro cytotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Goserelin  (Gos) as a synthetic analog of the mammalian gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is widely used in the treatment of sex hormone-related conditions. In this paper we present the chemical and biological aspects of its interaction with Cu(II) ions. The mode of Cu(II) binding and the thermodynamic stability of the obtained complexes were characterized by potentiometry, UV-Vis and CD spectroscopic methods. The DFT calculations were applied in order to investigate and confirm the molecular structure of the studied systems. The experimental and theoretical results clearly indicated the involvement of three nitrogens from the peptide and two oxygens from the  moieties in the Cu(II) coordination under physiological conditions. The investigated metallopeptide caused single- and/or double cleavage of the sugar-phosphate backbone of the plasmid DNA in the reaction accompanied by endogenous substances such as hydrogen peroxide or ascorbic acid. The degradation of the DNA molecule occurred via the free radical mechanism. Calculations based on measured spectra allowed determining the kinetic parameters of OH formation.

Though diffusion in protonated form is a significant route, carrier-mediated mechanisms constitute the major route for the entry of SCFA in their anionic form into  epithelium. Several transport systems operate in cellular uptake of SCFA. MCT1 (SLC16A1) and MCT4 (SLC16A3) are H+-coupled and mediate electroneutral transport of SCFA (H+: SCFA stoichiometry; 1:1). MCT1 is expressed both in the apical membrane and basolateral membrane of  epithelium whereas MCT4 specifically in the basolateral membrane. SMCT1 (SLC5A8) and SMCT2 (SLC5A12) are Na+-coupled; SMCT1-mediated transport is electrogenic (Na+: SCFA stoichiometry; 2:1) whereas SMCT2-mediated transport is electroneutral (Na+: SCFA stoichiometry; 1:1). SMCT1 and SMCT2 are expressed exclusively in the apical membrane. An anion-exchange mechanism also operates in the apical membrane in which SCFA entry in anionic form is coupled to bicarbonate efflux; the molecular identity of this exchanger however remains unknown. All these transporters are subject to regulation, notably by their substrates themselves; this process involves cell-surface receptors with SCFA as signaling molecules. There are significant alterations in the expression of these transporters in ulcerative colitis and . The tumor-associated changes occur via transcriptional regulation by p53 and HIF1α and by promoter methylation. As SCFA are obligatory for optimal  health, the transporters responsible for the entry and transcellular transfer of these bacterial products in  epithelium are critical determinants of  function under physiological conditions and in disease states. © 2018 American Physiological Society.

We developed a rapid, sensitive, high-throughput and reliable quantitative method to simultaneously profile 20 endogenous nucleosides and nucleotides in  cell lines based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC- MS/MS) by using a porous graphitic carbon column and basic mobile phase. The results indicated that high pH value of mobile phase containing 0.12% diethylamine (DEA) and 5mM NHOAC (pH 11.5) was the critical factor to prevent the adsorption of multi-phosphorylated species, and significantly improved peak shape and sensitivity. The optimized method was successfully validated with satisfactory linearity, sensitivity, accuracy, precision, matrix effects, recovery and stability for all analytes. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was in the range of 0.6-6nM (6-60 fmol on column). The validated method was applied to the extract of three epithelial  cell lines, and the significant difference in the profiling of the nucleosides and nucleotides among the  cell lines enables discrimination of breast  cell line from the  cell line and the lung  cell line. This quantified analytical method of 20 endogenous nucleosides and nucleotides in  cell lines meets the requirement of quantification in specific expanded metabolomics studies, with good selectivity and sensitivity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Soft corals of genus Sarcophyton were reported to contain compounds that are active against brine shrimp and promote paclitaxel cytotoxicity in the human  Caco-2 cell line. The n-hexane extract of the soft coral Sarcophyton tiocheliophorum induced significant dose-dependent toxicity (LC₅₀ 96.7 ppm) compared with ethyl  (LC₅₀. 120 ppm). We reported the most active cytotoxic level to be correspondence to LC₅₀ values of 20.2, 59.2 ppm and 18.9 and 26 ppm. Accordingly, bio-assay guided fractionation was conducted to identi- fy the bioactive compounds. Arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid were characterized based on GC-MS analyses.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the anticancer properties of ethyl  extract of Annona muricata leaves (EEAM) on HT-29 and HCT-116  cells and the underlying mechanisms.The effect of EEAM on the cell proliferation of HT-29 and HCT-116 cells was analyzed by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium) assay. High content screening system (HCS) was applied to investigate the cell membrane permeability, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), nuclear condensation and cytochrome c translocation from mitochondria to cytosol. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and activation of caspase-3/7, -8 and -9 were measured while treatment. Flow cytometric analysis was used to determine the cell cycle distribution and phosphatidylserine externalization. The protein expression of Bax and Bcl-2 was determined using immunofluorescence analysis. In addition, the potential of EEAM to suppress the migration and invasion of  cells was also examined.EEAM exerted significant cytotoxic effects on HCT-116 and HT-29 cells as determined by MTT and LDH assays. After 24 h treatment, EEAM exhibited the IC₅₀ value of 11.43 ± 1.87 µg/ml and 8.98 ± 1.24 µg/ml against HT-29 and HCT-116 cells, respectively. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated the cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and phosphatidylserine externalization confirming the induction of apoptosis. EEAM treatment caused excessive accumulation of ROS followed by disruption of MMP, cytochrome c leakage and activation of the initiator and executioner caspases in both  cells. Immunofluorescence analysis depicted the up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2 proteins while treated with EEAM. Furthermore, EEAM conspicuously blocked the migration and invasion of HT-29 and HCT-116 cells.These findings provide a scientific basis for the use of A. muricata leaves in the treatment of , although further in vivo studies are still required.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol metabolism, lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the . High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), which are risk factors for  inflammation and . In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs , propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the . Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate  cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related .

No symptoms of toxicity or mortality were observed. The mice survived being active and healthy during all 14 days of observation. In addition, the weight measurement of the left and right kidneys, heart, and liver shows no significant difference between the control, 5 g/kg, and 10 g/kg. All extracts (aqueous, petroleum ether, dichloromethane, ethyl , methanolic, and depleted aqueous extracts) of  tested against both types of  cells showed a more pronounced cytotoxic effect against breast cell line MDA-MB-231 than  cells line HT-29 cells. The most marked effect is that of the ethyl  extract with IC 30.90 ± 1.39 and 50.11 ± 1.44 (g/ml), respectively.

We have investigated gut bacterial changes induced by the whole date fruit extract (digested date extract; DDE) and its polyphenol-rich extract (date polyphenol extract; DPE) using faecal, pH-controlled, mixed batch cultures mimicking the distal part of the human large intestine, and utilising an array of microbial group-specific 16S rRNA oligonucleotide probes. Fluorescence microscopic enumeration indicated that there was a significant increase in the growth of bifidobacteria in response to both treatments, whilst whole dates also increased bacteroides at 24 h and the total bacterial counts at later fermentation time points when compared with DPE alone. Bacterial metabolism of whole date fruit led to the production of SCFA, with  significantly increasing following bacterial incubation with DDE. In addition, the production of flavonoid aglycones (myricetin, luteolin, quercetin and apigenin) and the anthocyanidin petunidin in less than 1 h was also observed. Lastly, the potential of DDE, DPE and metabolites to inhibit Caco-2 cell growth was investigated, indicating that both were capable of potentially acting as antiproliferative agents in vitro, following a 48 h exposure. This potential to inhibit growth was reduced following fermentation. Together these data suggest that consumption of date fruits may enhance  health by increasing beneficial bacterial growth and inhibiting the proliferation of  cells. This is an early suggestion that date intake by humans may aid in the maintenance of bowel health and even the reduction of colorectal  development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511712>In vitro anti  activity of ethanol extract fractions of Aerva lanata L.</a></h2><p>To explore in vitro anticancer potential of Aerva lanata L.

The above findings seem to relate to or indicate a shift to non-oxidative metabolic pathways in . In contrast to normal cells,  cells may lose the ability to utilize aerobic respiration due to either defective mitochondria or hypoxia within the tumor microenvironments. Glucose was shown to be the major energy source in  cells where it utilizes aerobic /anaerobic glycolysis with the resultant lactic acid formation. The role of energetic modulations and use of glycolytic inhibitors on /normal cell survival is not clearly established in the literature. We hypothesize that natural intermediates of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle will differentially and negatively impact the  phenotype in contrast to their no effects on the normal cell phenotype. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate six potential glycolytic modulators namely, Pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, Zn , sodium citrate, fructose diphosphate (FDP) and sodium bicarbonate at μM concentrations on growing A549 (lung ) and MRC-5 (normal; human lung fibroblast) cell lines with the objective of determining their influence on visual impact, cell metabolic activity, cell viability and end-point cell survival. Exposed and non-exposed cells were tested with phase-contrast micro-scanning, survival/death and metabolic activity trends through MTT-assays, as well as death end-point determinations by testing re-growth on complete media and T4 cellometer counts. Results showed that oxalic acid and Zn  both influenced the pH of the medium and resulted in differential massive cell debris within the exposure period. Pyruvic acid, sodium citrate, sodium bicarbonate and FDP did not cause pH changes; however, they caused detectable cell disfigurement and loss of metabolic activity, viability and survival/ death end points with the resultant death of the A549 cell line. The MRC-5 cell line was differentially unaffected by exposure to pyruvic acid, sodium citrate, sodium bicarbonate, FDP and Zn , underwent complete recovery and remained both attached and healthy for 6 weeks upon subculture when transferred to a new complete medium. Oxalic acid did not show differential modulation with the consequent loss of survival and death of the MRC-5 cell line. Phase contrast, metabolic activity, cell counts as well as death end-point findings confirmed our hypothsis.

We have demonstrated that in humans, inflammatory conditions that predispose to development of skin and  tumors are associated with accumulation in tissues of CD33+S100A9+ cells, the phenotype typical for myeloid-derived suppressor cells in  or immature myeloid cells (IMCs) in tumor-free hosts. To identify the direct role of these cells in tumor development, we used S100A9 transgenic mice to create the conditions for topical accumulation of these cells in the skin in the absence of infection or tissue damage. These mice demonstrated accumulation of granulocytic IMCs in the skin upon topical application of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA), resulting in a dramatic increase in the formation of papillomas during epidermal carcinogenesis. The effect of IMCs on tumorigenesis was not associated with immune suppression, but with CCL4 (chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 4)-mediated recruitment of IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells. This chemokine was released by activated IMCs. Elimination of CD4+ T cells or blockade of CCL4 or IL-17 abrogated the increase in tumor formation caused by myeloid cells. Thus, this study implicates accumulation of IMCs as an initial step in facilitation of tumor formation, followed by the recruitment of CD4+ T cells.© 2015 Ortiz et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30515005>The Level Short Chain Fatty Acids and HSP 70 in Colorectal  and Non-Colorectal .</a></h2><p>Microbial involvement in colorectal  (CRC) is now well established.

Nevertheless, the water-insolubility and short biological half-life limit its further development. In the present study, polyethylene glycol-modified, Amoitone B-loaded long circulating nanostructured lipid carriers (AmB-PEG-NLC) were prepared by the emulsion-evaporation and low temperature-solidification method. The in vitro antitumor activity and intracellular uptake of AmB-PEG-NLC in the human  SW620 cells and liver  HepG2 cells were evaluated in detail. MTT assay was employed to investigate the inhibition effect on cellular viability. Propidium iodide and DAPI staining were performed to visually examine the fluorescent morphology changes of the cells incubated with AmB-PEG-NLC. Flow cytometry was utilized to determine the influence of AmB-PEG-NLC on apoptosis of SW620. The intracellular uptake was observed by rhodamine B, a fluorescent maker. Cytotoxicity assay, observation of morphological changes and apoptosis examination revealed that AmB-PEG-NLC could markedly enhance the cytotoxicity of AmB against  cell compared to AmB solution and AmB-NLC. An increased uptake of PEG-NLC was obtained compared with NLC in SW620 cells, which might attribute to the effect of PEG. Based on these results, AmB-PEG-NLC could be a promising delivery system for AmB with effective  therapy.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated the variation trend of CD4+CD29+T cells together with MPO, VCAM-1 in different periods of rat UC model and UC patients. We also evaluated the relationship between CD4+CD29+T cells and disease severity. UC model was induced by administering DNCB liquid and  solution.

The current treatments for CIM are palliative and have limited benefit. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist is a natural antagonist of interleukin-1. Our previous studies showed the protective effect of recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (rhIL-1Ra) on the intestine in mice after 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy. In this study, we further evaluated rhIL-1Ra in the treatment of CIM induced by different chemoagents and their combination. Normal as well as tumor-bearing mice were administered oxaliplatin (L-OHP), 5-fluorouracil, or their combination to induce intestinal mucositis and mortality. rhIL-1Ra administered after the chemotherapy, but not after the onset of diarrhea, significantly improved mouse survival, attenuated body weight loss, and reduced the incidence, severity, and duration of diarrhea. Histological examination showed that rhIL-1Ra-treated mice had a relatively intact mucosa structure, more proliferating crypt cells, and higher acid mucin content than the vehicle-treated mice. rhIL-1Ra suppressed crypt apoptosis by reducing the levels of proapoptotic proteins in wild-type, but not in IL-1RI or p53 mice. In addition, rhIL-1Ra was as effective as octreotide  in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea, but with the advantage of reducing the epithelial apoptosis, the major cause of CIM. Importantly, the tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy was not affected by rhIL-1Ra. Thus, our data strongly suggest that rhIL-1Ra may be useful for the treatment of intestinal mucositis and improving the quality of life for  patients on chemotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31257531>Propionate of a microbiota metabolite induces cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in lung .</a></h2><p>Short‑chain fatty acids (SCFAs; butyrate, propionate and ) are metabolites derived from the gut microbiota via dietary fiber fermentation.

Diet and host genetics play critical roles in shaping the composition of gut microbiota. Whether diet and host genes interact with each other to bring specific changes in gut microbiota that affect intestinal carcinogenesis is unknown. Ability of dietary fibre to specifically increase beneficial gut microbiota at the expense of pathogenic bacteria in vivo via unknown mechanism is an important process that suppresses intestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis. Free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2 or GPR43) is a receptor for short-chain fatty acids (, propionate and butyrate), metabolites of dietary fibre fermentation by gut microbiota. Here, we show FFAR2 is down modulated in human  cancers than matched adjacent healthy tissue. Consistent with this, Ffar2(-/-) mice are hypersusceptible to development of intestinal carcinogenesis. Dietary fibre suppressed  carcinogenesis in an Ffar2-dependent manner. Ffar2 played an essential role in dietary fibre-mediated promotion of beneficial gut microbiota, Bifidobacterium species (spp) and suppression of Helicobacter hepaticus and Prevotellaceae. Moreover, numbers of Bifidobacterium is reduced, whereas those of Prevotellaceae are increased in human  cancers than matched adjacent normal tissue. Administration of Bifidobacterium mitigated intestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis in Ffar2(-/-) mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that interplay between dietary fibre and Ffar2 play a key role in promoting healthy composition of gut microbiota that stimulates intestinal health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24657612>Research on the in vitro anticancer activity and in vivo tissue distribution of Amoitone B nanocrystals.</a></h2><p>Amoitone B, a natural agonist to Nur77, is a promising anticancer drug.

Through comparison of cytotoxicity towards sensitive and multi-drug resistant cell lines, we identified that the semisynthetic esters sipholenol A-4-O- and sipholenol A-4-O-isonicotinate potently reversed P-gp-mediated MDR but had no effect on MRP1/ABCC1 and BCRP/ABCG2-mediated MDR. The results from [3H]-paclitaxel accumulation and efflux studies suggested that these two triterpenoids were able to increase the intracellular accumulation of paclitaxel by inhibiting its active efflux. In addition, western blot analysis revealed that these two compounds did not alter the expression levels of P-gp when treated up to 72 h. These sipholenol derivatives also stimulated the ATPase activity of P-gp membranes, which suggested that they might be substrates of P-gp.

The same dose in a human would require three cups of tomato powder three times daily. To reduce the volume, we sought a method to concentrate 6F. Remarkably, extracting the transgenic freeze-dried tomato overnight in ethyl  with 5% acetic acid resulted in a 37-fold reduction in the amount of transgenic tomato needed for biologic activity. In a mouse model of dyslipidemia, adding 0.06% by weight of the tomato concentrate expressing the 6F peptide (Tg6F) to a WD significantly reduced plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides (P < 0.0065). In a mouse model of  metastatic to the lungs, adding 0.06% of Tg6F, but not a control tomato concentrate (EV), to standard mouse chow reduced tumor-associated neutrophils by 94 ± 1.1% (P = 0.0052), and reduced tumor burden by two-thirds (P = 0.0371). Adding 0.06% of either EV or Tg6F by weight to standard mouse chow significantly reduced tumor burden in a mouse model of ovarian ; however, Tg6F was significantly more effective (35% reduction for EV vs. 53% reduction for Tg6F; P = 0.0069). Providing the same dose of tomato concentrate to humans would require only two tablespoons three times daily making this a practical approach for testing oral apoA-I mimetic therapy in the treatment of dyslipidemia and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30208917>Mucosal associated invariant T cells from human breast ducts mediate a Th17-skewed response to bacterially exposed breast carcinoma cells.</a></h2><p>Antimicrobial T cells play key roles in the disease progression of cancers arising in mucosal epithelial tissues, such as the . However, little is known about microbe-reactive T cells within human breast ducts and whether these impact breast carcinogenesis.Epithelial ducts were isolated from primary human breast tissue samples, and the associated T lymphocytes were characterized using flow cytometric analysis. Functional assays were performed to determine T-cell cytokine secretion in response to bacterially treated human breast carcinoma cells.We show that human breast epithelial ducts contain mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, an innate T-cell population that recognizes specific bacterial metabolites presented by nonclassical MR1 antigen-presenting molecules. The MAIT cell population from breast ducts resembled that of peripheral blood in its innate lymphocyte phenotype (i.e., CD161, PLZF, and interleukin [IL]-18 receptor coexpression), but the breast duct MAIT cell population had a distinct T-cell receptor Vβ use profile and was markedly enriched for IL-17-producing cells compared with blood MAIT cells. Breast carcinoma cells that had been exposed to Escherichia coli activated MAIT cells in an MR1-dependent manner. However, whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-/ionomycin stimulation induced the production of both interferon-γ and IL-17 by breast duct MAIT cells, bacterially exposed breast carcinoma cells elicited a strongly IL-17-biased response. Breast carcinoma cells also showed upregulated expression of natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) ligands compared with primary breast epithelial cells, and the NKG2D receptor contributed to MAIT cell activation by the carcinoma cells.These results demonstrate that MAIT cells from human breast ducts mediate a selective T-helper 17 cell response to human breast carcinoma cells that were exposed to E. coli. Thus, cues from the breast microbiome and the expression of stress-associated ligands by neoplastic breast duct epithelial cells may shape MAIT cell responses during breast carcinogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31267009>Liposomal formulation of Galbanic acid improved therapeutic efficacy of pegylated liposomal Doxorubicin in mouse  carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Galbanic acid (Gba), a sesquiterpene coumarin, with strong antiangiogenic activity could serve as an excellent anti- agent. However, Gba is a poor water-solube which hampered its clinical application. In this study, a pegylated liposomal Gba (PLGba) with HSPC/Cholesterol/mPEG-DSPE (56.2, 38.3, 5.3% molar ratio) was developed by the thin film hydration plus extrusion and calcium  gradient remote loading method, to address the issue of poor Gba solubility. Moreover, an integrin-targeting ligand (RGD peptide, cyclo[Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Tyr-Cys]) was post-inserted into liposomes in order to increase Gba cell delivery. Using fluorescently-labeled model liposomes, it was found that the targeting could improve the integrin-mediated cellular uptake of the liposomes in vitro in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and in vivo as evidenced by chicken chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis (CAM) model. It also could enrich the liposome accumulation in C26 tumor. Interestingly, co-treatment with PLGba and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD, also known as Doxil) had a synergistic and antagonistic antiproliferative effect on the C26 tumor cell line and the normal HUVEC, respectively. In C26 tumor bearing BALB/c mice, the PLGba and PLD combinatorial therapy improved the antitumor efficacy of the treatment as compared to those of single agents.

This study aimed to provide scientific evidence to therapeutic properties by determining cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic activity of HPLC fractions from leaves on HCT116 human  carcinoma and A549 human lung carcinoma cell lines. Ethanolic extraction was performed on V globosa leaves followed by hexane and ethyl  partitioning. Silica gel column chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) produced MP1, MP2 and MP3 fractions. Cytotoxic activity of the fractions was determined through MTT assay against the  cell lines HCT116 and A549 and the non- AA8 Chinese hamster ovarian cell line. Pro-apoptotic activities of the most active fractions were further assessed through DAPI staining, TUNEL assay and JC-1 mitochondrial membrane potential assay with HCT116 cells. While the MP1 fraction exerted no significant activity against all cell lines tested, MP2 and MP3 fractions demonstrated high toxicity against HCT116 and A549 cells. The MP3 fraction induced formation of apoptotic bodies, condensed DNA and other morphological changes consistent with apoptosis of HCT116 cells and TUNEL assay showed significant increase in DNA fragmentation over time. In these cells, the MP3 fraction also induced mitochondrial membrane destabilization, which is generally associated with the beginning of apoptosis. Phytochemical analysis demonstrated the presence only of saponins and terpenoids in the MP3 fraction. The results indicate that the MP3 fraction exerts cytotoxic activity on HCT116 cells via induction of apoptosis triggered by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential crucial for cell survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30103409>Phenolic Compounds and Bioactivity of  Pourr.</a></h2><p>The present study focuses on the chemical composition, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antiproliferative activities of the ethyl  and aqueous extracts obtained from the aerial parts of  Pourr.

The ethanol crude and fractions (hexane, ethyl  and water) of D. bulbifera were subjected to cell viability MTT assay against various  cell lines. The lowest IC50 of the extract and fractions on selected  cells were selected for further apoptosis assay and western blot analysis. HCT116  cells were treated with D. bulbifera and stained with Annexin/PI or Hoechst 33342/PI for preliminary confirmation of apoptosis. The dissipation of mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) was determined by flow cytometry. The protein expressions of apoptosis-related proteins such as Bcl-2 family, caspases, Fas, PARP, ERK1/2 and JNK were detected by western blot analysis. Moreover, the HCT116 cells were treated with UO126 and SP600125 inhibitors to verify the involvement of ERK1/2 and JNK protein expressions in inducing apoptotic cell death. Based on the result, D. bulbifera ethyl  fraction (DBEAF) exhibited the most compelling cytotoxicity on HCT116 cells with an IC50 of 37.91 ± 1.30 µg/mL. The induction of apoptosis was confirmed by phosphatidylserine externalization and chromatin condensation. Depolarization of MMP further conferred the induction of apoptosis was through the regulation of Bcl-2 family proteins. Activation of caspase cascades (caspase-3, -9, -8 and -10) was elicited followed by the observation of cleaved PARP accumulation in DBEAF-treated cells. Furthermore, death receptor, Fas was activated upon exposure to DBEAF. Collective apoptotic evidences suggested the involvement of intrinsic and extrinsic pathways by DBEAF in HCT116 cells. Interestingly, the attenuation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation accompanied by the activation of JNK was detected in DBEAF-treated cells. In conclusion, the findings revealed that DBEAF induced apoptosis through intrinsic and extrinsic pathways involving ERK1/2 and JNK.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Of these, IB-F002C was the most active with IC values 24.75, 47.91, 52.37, 34.17, 46.07, and 25.89 μg/ml against breast, -1, -2, ovary, lung, and head/neck  cell lines, respectively. The bioassay-guided isolation from IB-F002C afforded a glucocerebroside, which showed 10.51%, 12.19%, 16.14%, and 34.05% inhibition of head and neck, breast-1, -1, and ovarian  cell lines, respectively. Octadecyl coumarate, 7-hydroxycoumarin, and 6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin that showed different antioxidant potentials were also identified in this study.

Bioactive food ingredients such as prebiotics have protective potential in . Data on galacto-oligosaccharides (GalOS) against CRC are very limited and GalOS used in this study have β-1,6 and β-1,3 as major glycosidic linkages and, to our best knowledge, were never used before against any  treatment. This study aims to investigate the protective role of novel GalOS against various biomarkers of CRC including aberrant crypt foci (ACF), bacterial enzymes and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) in a rodent model induced with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH). Inulin group was taken as positive control in present study to compare novel GalOS protective effects. GalOS doses of 76-151 mg and inulin doses of 114 mg were given to different groups treated with DMH. Results showed that ACF formation was significantly ( ≤ 0.05) less in high dose GalOS group (27.3%). GalOS also had protective effects against DMH-induced body weight loss and showed higher level of cecal and fecal SCFA (, propionate and butyrate). High doses of GalOS also resulted in significant ( ≤ 0.05) reduction of bacterial enzymatic activities. Increased populations of beneficial bacteria (bifidobacteria and lactobacilli) and decreased concentrations of harmful bacteria were observed in all prebiotics treatment groups. It can be concluded that novel GalOS exhibit robust protective activity against ACF formation in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24871557>Inhibitory effects of Baccharis dracunculifolia on 1,2-dimethylhidrazine-induced genotoxicity and preneoplastic lesions in rat .</a></h2><p>Baccharis dracunculifolia (Asteraceae), the main botanical source of green propolis, also known as 'alecrim-do-campo' and 'vassourinha', is a shrub of the Brazilian 'cerrado' and is native to the South and Southeast of Brazil. The effects of B. dracunculifolia ethyl  extract (Bd-EAE) were evaluated on the 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced DNA damage and aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the  of male Wistar rats by the comet and ACF assays, respectively. The animals were treated by gavage with doses of 6, 12, and 24 mg/kg body weight/day. Animals were also administered a single subcutaneous injection of 40 mg/kg DMH and were killed after 4 h for evaluation of DNA damage. Also, two doses of 40 mg/kg of DMH were administered weekly for 2 weeks, and animals were killed 2 weeks after the last injection for evaluation of ACF development in the . The results showed a significant reduction in the frequency of DNA damage and ACF in the group treated with the Bd-EAE plus DMH in comparison with those treated with DMH alone, suggesting that Bd-EAE reduced DNA damage and suppressed the formation of ACF and also exerted a protective affect against  carcinogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27378626>Isolation and characterization of alborixin from Streptomyces scabrisporus: A potent cytotoxic agent against human  (HCT-116)  cells.</a></h2><p>The ethyl  extract from the fermentation broth of an actinomycete strain, identified as Streptomyces scabrisporus isolated from soil of Kashmir Himalayas - India, exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against a panel of human  cell lines. The active fraction subjected to column chromatography led to the isolation of pharmacologically potent anticancer compound whose structure was established to be alborixin on the basis of spectral data analysis. The compound exhibited antiproliferative activity against panel of cell lines N2a, MCF-7, MiaPaca-2, PC-3, HCT-116, MDA-MB-231, HL-60 and A-549 cells with IC50 of 9.7, 15.4, 7.2, 8.1, 3.2, 9.7, 7.5 and 11.5 μM respectively. Alborixin displayed the maximum cytotoxic activity against HCT-116 human  carcinoma cells and therefore further studies were carried on this cell line. Alborixin decreased the clonogenic potential of HCT-116 cells in a dose dependent manner. It induced apoptotic cell death in HCT116 cells that were confirmed by Flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V/PI staining and microscopic examination of cellular morphology through DAPI-stained cells. Biochemical evidence of apoptosis came from elevating the intracellular ROS level that was accompanied by mitochondrial membrane potential loss, decreasing the expression profile of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, whereas it augments cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP-1, activates caspase-8 and 9 with concomitant increase in expression of proapoptotic protein Bax in a dose dependent manner. These results indicate that alborixin obtained from Streptomyces scabrisporus IIIM55 induces apoptotic cell death in  cells HCT-116 and can be further evaluated for its potential as an anticancer agent.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Decidualization involves proliferation of the endometrial stromal cells, with differentiation into morphologically distinct decidual cells. Previous reports involving nonpregnant rhesus monkeys have described local- ized and widespread endometrial decidualization in response to administration of progesterone and synthetic progestogens. Ectopic decidua or 'deciduosis' describes the condition in which groups of decidual cells are located outside of the endometrium, most often in the ovaries, uterus and cervix but also in various other organs. In humans, most cases of deciduosis are associated with normal pregnancy, and ectopic decidua can be found in the ovary in nearly all term pregnancies. Here we describe pronounced endometrial decidualization in 2 rhesus macaques. Both macaques had been treated long-term with medroxyprogesterone  for presumed endometriosis, which was confirmed in one of the macaques at postmortem examination. In one animal, florid extrauterine and peritoneal serosal decidualization was admixed multifocally with carcinomatosis from a primary  adenocarcinoma. Cells constituting endometrial and serosal decidualization reactions were immunopositive for the stromal markers CD10, collagen IV, smooth muscle actin, and vimentin and immunonegative for cytokeratin. In contrast, carcinomatous foci were cytokeratin-positive. To our knowledge, this report describes the first cases of serosal peritoneal decidualization in rhesus macaques. The concurrent presentation of serosal peritoneal decidualization with carcinomatosis is unique.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25905289>Management of Neuroendocrine Tumors of the GI Tract.</a></h2><p>Somatostatin, a tetradecapeptide, is a small cyclic peptide. It circulates in the blood in two biologically active forms: somatostatin 14 and somatostatin 28 (429;430), processed from their precursor pre- and pre-pro-somatostatin molecules. Somatostatin inhibits the secretion and action of a number of peptide hormones, neurotransmitters, and exocrine secretions of the GEP axis. It also inhibits a variety of gastrointestinal functions including gastrointestinal motility, gastric acid production, pancreatic enzyme secretion bile secretion and  secretions. It inhibits secretion of a number of gastrointestinal and pancreatic hormones such as insulin, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide, secretin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. In addition to it functions as a regulator of neurotransmission and gastric and intestinal hormone secretions, it may control cell proliferation in normal tissues and in tumors(429;431;432). Its clinical use is limited because of its short half-life of 1 to 2 minutes, the need to give it intravenously and the multifarious effects and the rebound of secretions when it was stopped (433). Development (433) of its potent, long-acting octapeptide analogue (Sandostatin, octreotide ) with a half-life of over 100 minutes was a breakthrough for clinical application. Other analogues such as somatuline (BIM 23014 C) are being investigated. Thus far, their effectiveness and toxicity rates appear to be similar to those of octreotide. Several aspects of treatment of GEP , including symptom reduction, hormone suppression, tumor growth, and survival, are discussed here.Copyright © 2000-2019, MDText.com, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25482948>Butyrylated starch affects colorectal  markers beneficially and dose-dependently in genotoxin-treated rats.</a></h2><p>Population studies suggest that greater dietary fiber intake may lower colorectal  (CRC) risk, possibly through the  bacterial fermentative production of butyrate. Butyrylated starch delivers butyrate to the  of humans with potential to reduce CRC risk but high doses may exacerbate risk through promoting epithelial proliferation. Here we report the effects of increasing dietary butyrylated high amylose maize starch (HAMSB) on azoxymethane (AOM) induced distal  DNA damage, cell proliferation, mucus layer thickness and apoptosis in rats. Five groups of 15 rats were fed AIN-93G based diets containing 0-40% HAMSB for 4 weeks then injected with (AOM) and killed 6 hours later. Large bowel total SCFA,  and butyrate pools and hepatic portal venous plasma total SCFA,  and butyrate concentrations were higher with greater HAMSB intake. Distal  epithelial apoptotic index and  mucus thickness increased, while DNA single strand breaks decreased dose-dependently with greater HAMSB intake. Colonocyte proliferation rates were unaffected by diet. These data suggest that increasing large bowel butyrate may reduce the risk of CRC in a dose dependent manner by enhancing apoptotic surveillance in the  epithelium for damaged cells without promoting the risk of tumorigenesis through increased cell proliferation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24281857>Combined incubation of  carcinoma cells with phorbol ester and mitochondrial uncoupling agents results in synergic elevated reactive oxygen species levels and increased γ-glutamyltransferase expression.</a></h2><p>The NADPH oxidase (NOX) is a significant determinant for the expression and activity of γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), which is frequently upregulated after increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress. Earlier studies on human  carcinoma HT-29 cells have shown that treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) activates NOX thus increasing the intracellular level of ROS and upregulating GGT. Another important source of cellular ROS is the mitochondria, and treatment with the mitochondria uncoupler carbonylcyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (FCCP) results in increased ROS levels. The present study shows that when HT-29 cells were simultaneously treated with both agents, a significant and synergic increase in intracellular ROS was detected. NOX activity contributed at least 50 % of this increase as inhibiting NOX activity with apocynin or downregulating the NOX activity using siRNA against p22 phox reduced the synergic ROS production. The combined FCCP and PMA treatment also provoked highly increased GGT mRNA levels after 24 h whereas only minor and delayed increases in GGT protein and enzyme activity levels were detected. The results strongly indicate that ROS production by both mitochondria and NOX is involved in the regulation of GGT expression in  carcinoma cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26220166>CD161(int)CD8+ T cells: a novel population of highly functional, memory CD8+ T cells enriched within the gut.</a></h2><p>The C-type lectin-like receptor CD161 is expressed by lymphocytes found in human gut and liver, as well as blood, especially natural killer (NK) cells, T helper 17 (Th17) cells, and a population of unconventional T cells known as mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. The association of high CD161 expression with innate T-cell populations including MAIT cells is established. Here we show that CD161 is also expressed, at intermediate levels, on a prominent subset of polyclonal CD8+ T cells, including antiviral populations that display a memory phenotype. These memory CD161(int)CD8+ T cells are enriched within the  and express both CD103 and CD69, markers associated with tissue residence. Furthermore, this population was characterized by enhanced polyfunctionality, increased levels of cytotoxic mediators, and high expression of the transcription factors T-bet and eomesodermin (EOMES). Such populations were induced by novel vaccine strategies based on adenoviral vectors, currently in trial against hepatitis C virus. Thus, intermediate CD161 expression marks potent polyclonal, polyfunctional tissue-homing CD8+ T-cell populations in humans. As induction of such responses represents a major aim of T-cell prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines in viral disease and , analysis of these populations could be of value in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29848266>The Role of Diet Related Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Colorectal  Metabolism and Survival: Prevention and Therapeutic Implications.</a></h2><p>Colorectal  (CRC) is a major cause of -related death worldwide. CRC increased risk has been associated with alterations in the intestinal microbiota, with decreased production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs produced in the human  are the major products of bacterial fermentation of undigested dietary fiber and starch. While colonocytes use the three major SCFAs, namely , propionate and butyrate, as energy sources, transformed CRC cells primarily undergo aerobic glycolysis. Compared to normal colonocytes, CRC cells exhibit increased sensitivity to SCFAs, thus indicating they play an important role in cell homeostasis. Manipulation of SCFA levels in the intestine, through changes in microbiota, has therefore emerged as a potential preventive/therapeutic strategy for CRC. Interest in understanding SCFAs mechanism of action in CRC cells has increased in the last years. Several SCFA transporters like SMCT-1, MCT-1 and aquaporins have been identified as the main transmembrane transporters in intestinal cells. Recently, it was shown that  promotes plasma membrane re-localization of MCT-1 and triggers changes in the glucose metabolism. SCFAs induce apoptotic cell death in CRC cells, and further mechanisms have been discovered, including the involvement of lysosomal membrane permeabilization, associated with mitochondria dysfunction and degradation. In this review, we will cover the current knowledge on the transport of SCFAs by CRC cells and their effects on CRC metabolism and survival. The impact of increasing SCFA production by manipulation of  microbiota on the prevention/therapy of CRC will also be addressed.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31218963>Synthesis, Characterization, Antimicrobial Activity and Anticancer of some new pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines and pyrazolo[5,1-c]1,2,4-triazines.</a></h2><p>Pyrazole and its derivatives are known to exhibit significant biological and pharmacological activities such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, analgesic, antiviral, antimicrobial, antifunga, anti-glycemic, antiamoebic, and antidepressive . Considering the immense biological properties, pyrazole is one of the most wide studied nitrogen-containing heterocyclic nuclei. Fused pyrazole derivatives are composed of the pyrazole nucleus attached to other heterocyclic moieties.The objective of this article is the synthesis of some new pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine and pyrazolo[5,1-c]1,2,4-triazine derivatives with potential anticancer and antimicrobial activities.To evaluate The in vitro growth inhibitory rates (%) and inhibitory growth activity (as measured by IC50) of the newly synthesized compounds were determined against the MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cell line in comparison with the well-known anticancer drug doxorubicin as the standard, using the MTT viability assay. Data generated were used to plot a dose response curve from which the concentration (µM) of tested compounds required to kill 50% of cell population (IC50) was determined. Cytotoxic activity was expressed as the mean IC50 of three independent experiments. The difference between inhibitory activities of all compounds with different concentrations was statistically significant p lt; 0.001. All compounds were structurally characterized by different spectroscopic techniques EI-MS, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and evaluated for their anticancer and antimicrobial activities (antibacterial and antifungal).Several pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine derivatives were synthesized from the reaction of 2-(4-(5-amino-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)phenyl)-1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione with the appropriate active methylene compounds in a boiling ethanol. Also, pyrazolo[5,1-c]triazines were obtained through the reaction of 2-(4-(5-(chlorodiazenyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)phenyl)-1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione with various active methylene compounds in ethanol containing sodium  at 0-5 0C. The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were elucidated on the basis of elemental analysis, spectral data, and alternative synthetic routes whenever possible. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antitumor activity against a breast  cell line (MCF-7) and a human  cell line (HCT-116). The results revealed that the tested compounds showed high variation in the inhibitory growth rates and activities against the tested tumor cell lines. All newly synthesized compounds screen towards microorganisms e.g. Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria and Fungi.2-(4-(5-Amino-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)phenyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione proved to be a useful precursor for synthesis of various pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine and pyrazolo[5,1-c]-1,2,4-triazines. The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by spectral data and elemental analyses. The newly synthesized compounds were tested in-vitro against the MCF-7, HCT-116 human  cell line and compared with doxorubicin as the standard, using the MTT viability assay.

Each fungal endophytic strain was identified by sequencing of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of rDNA. Ethyl  extracts were prepared from each endophyte cultivated in vitro and tested for their respective antibacterial activities and antiproliferative activities against human  cells. Antibacterial screening was carried out against two bacterial strains: Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, by the broth dilution method. Cell viability was evaluated by the MTT procedure after exposure of MCF7 breast  cells and HT29 or HCT116 human  adenocarcinoma cells to each endophytic extract. Of interest, Byssochlamys spectabilis isolated from Euphorbia prostata showed cytotoxicity (IC50 = 1.51 ± 0.2 μg mL(-1)) against MCF7 cells, but had a low effect against HT29 or HCT116 cells (IC50 > 20 μg mL(-1)). Cladosporium cladosporioides 2, isolated from Vernonia amygdalina leaves, showed antiproliferative activities against MCF7 cells (IC50 = 10.5 ± 1.5 μg mL(-1)) only. On the other hand, B. spectabilis and Alternaria sp. extract had antibacterial activities against the S. aureus strain. The findings of this work revealed that endophytic fungi associated with medicinal plants from Sudan could be considered as an attractive source of new therapeutic compounds.© FEMS 2016.

Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a crucial event promoting malignant transformation, is regulated by inflammation and Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) plays an important role in this process. Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, was shown to prevent  tumors in different settings. We recently found that an extra-pure formulation of EPA as Free Fatty Acid (EPA-FFA) protects from  development in a mouse model of Colitis-Associated  (CAC) through modulation of NOTCH1 signalling. In this study, we exposed  cells to an inflammatory stimulus represented by a cytokine-enriched Conditioned Medium (CM), obtained from THP1-differentiated macrophages. We found, for the first time, that CM strongly up-regulated NOTCH1 signalling and EMT markers, leading to increased invasiveness. Importantly, NOTCH1 signalling was dependent on MMP9 activity, upon CM exposure. We show that a non-cytotoxic pre-treatment with EPA-FFA antagonizes the effect of inflammation on NOTCH1 signalling, with reduction of MMP9 activity and invasiveness. In conclusion, our data suggest that, in CRC cells, inflammation induces NOTCH1 activity through MMP9 up-regulation and that this mechanism can be counteracted by EPA-FFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089393>Metabolomics Analysis in Serum from Patients with Colorectal Polyp and Colorectal  by H-NMR Spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Colorectal  (CRC) is one of the leading causes of -related death worldwide. Colorectal adenomatous polyps are at high risk for the development of CRC. In this report, we described the metabolic changes in the sera from patients with colorectal polyps and CRC by using the NMR-based metabolomics. 110 serum samples were collected from patients and healthy controls, including 40 CRC patients, 32 colorectal polyp patients, and 38 healthy controls. The metabolic profiles and differential metabolites of sera were analyzed by multivariate statistical analysis (MSA), including principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) methods. A total of 23 differential metabolites were identified from MSA. According to the pathway analysis and multivariate ROC curve-based exploratory analysis by using the relative concentrations of differential metabolites, we found abnormal metabolic pathways and potential biomarkers involved with the colorectal polyp and CRC. The results showed that the pyruvate metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism were activated in colorectal polyps. And the glycolysis and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism were activated in CRC. The changed metabolism may promote cellular proliferation. In addition, we found that the rates of /glycerol and lactate/citrate could be the potential biomarkers in colorectal polyp and CRC, respectively.

The compound was evaluated in two human  cell lines for its cytotoxic effect and the most sensitive cell line, SW-480, was selected for the mechanistic evaluation of its anticancer and chemopreventive efficacy. The non-toxic nature of [6]-gingerol was confirmed by viability assays on rapidly dividing normal mouse  cells. [6]-gingerol inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis as evidenced by externalization of phosphatidyl serine in SW-480, while the normal  cells were unaffected. Sensitivity to [6]-gingerol in SW-480 cells was associated with activation of caspases 8, 9, 3 &7 and cleavage of PARP, which attests induction of apoptotic cell death. Mechanistically, [6]-gingerol down-regulated Phorbol Myristate  (PMA) induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK MAP kinases and activation of AP-1 transcription factor, but had only little effects on phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and activation of NF-kappa B. Additionally, it complemented the inhibitors of either ERK1/2 or JNK MAP kinase in bringing down the PMA-induced cell proliferation in SW-480 cells.

Although malignant  and gastric  have been reported in CCS, reports of distant metastasis have been rare in CCS.A 58-year-old male was referred from a nearby hospital with diarrhea and weight loss. The patient was hypoproteinemia (17.9 g/L), and multiple polyps were observed in the large intestine. He also had alopecia, onychatrophia, and dysgeusia.The presence of multiple polyps and associated symptoms of alopecia, onychatrophia, pigmentation, and dysgeusia informed the diagnosis of CCS.He was treated with 20mg dexamethasone  per day for about 3 months, 10 mg for about 9 month, 5 mg for about 1 year, and then maintained on 5 mg daily. Three years after starting treatment, colonoscopy revealed  and  adenomas. A sigmoidectomy revealed 4 well-differentiated adenocarcinomas of the ulcerating type in the sigmoid , and tubularadenomas throughout the rest of the large intestine. He was treated with FOLFOX6 for 6 months. At this stage liver metastasis was found. A right hepatectomy was performed confirming hepatic metastasis of  adenocarcinoma, which was GPC-3(-), CD34(-), CK20(+), CDX-2(+), Hep(-), CK19(+), and CK8(+).The patient received 3 courses of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy.The patient's status has been stable for more than 2 years, and there was no tumor recurrence or metastasis occurred.CCS is a rare cause of multiple polyposis most often treated with hormone therapy. Regular follow-ups are very important to ensure discovery of malignant tumors at an early stage.

Eight compounds including rutamarin were isolated from the active chloroform extract and evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against HT29 human  carcinoma cell line and CCD-18Co noncancer cells. Further studies on the induction of apoptosis such as morphological examinations, biochemical analyses, cell cycle analysis, and caspase activation assay were conducted in rutamarin-treated HT29 cells.Rutamarin exhibited remarkable cytotoxic activity against HT29 cells (IC value of 5.6 μM) but was not toxic to CCD-18Co cells. The morphological and biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis including activation of caspases 3, 8, and 9 were observed in rutamarin-treated HT29 cells.

Betanin treatment at the concentration of 100 μM for 24 h increased DNA damage assessed by comet assay in IBD patients' neutrophils. A similar effect although less pronounced was observed in Caco-2 cells. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with H2O2 caused a 4-fold increase of DNA strand breaks in comparison to untreated cells, but pre-treatment with betanin reduced DNA damage in these cells. Betanin also induced procaspase-3 cleavage and caspase-3 activity accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, indicating its pro-apoptotic activity. These results suggest that betanin may support mechanisms that lead to the release of ROS and apoptotic cell death. In this way betanin may exert anti-inflammatory and potentially  preventive activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31118064>Aberrant activation of CYR61 enhancers in colorectal  development.</a></h2><p>High expression of secreted matricellular protein cysteine-rich 61 (CYR61) correlates with poor prognosis in colorectal  (CRC). Aberrant enhancer activation has been shown to correlate with expression of key genes involved in  progression. However, such mechanisms in CYR61 transcription regulation remain unexplored.Expression of CYR61 was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting (WB) in CRC patients paraffin specimens and  cell lines. ChIP-seq data of enhancer-characteristic histone modifications, in CRC tissues from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, were reanalyzed to search for putative enhancers of CYR61. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to detected enhancer activity. Physical interactions between putative enhancers and CYR61 promoter were detected by chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay. Histone modification and transcription factors (TFs) enrichment were detected by ChIP-qPCR. Additionally, biological function of enhancers was investigated by transwell migration assays.CRC tissues and cell lines expressed higher level of CYR61 than normal  mucosa. Three putative enhancers located downstream of CYR61 were found in CRC tissues by ChIP-seq data reanalysis. Consistent with the ChIP-seq analysis results in the GEO database, the normal  mucosal epithelial cell line NCM460 possessed no active CYR61 enhancers, whereas  cells exhibited different patterns of active CYR61 enhancers. HCT116 cells had an active Enhancer3, whereas RKO cells had both Enhancer1 and Enhancer3 active. Pioneer factor FOXA1 promoted CYR61 expression by recruiting CBP histone acetyltransferase binding and increasing promoter-enhancer looping frequencies and enhancer activity. CBP knockdown attenuated H3K27ac enrichment, promoter-enhancer looping frequencies, and enhancer activity. Small molecule compound 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13- (TPA) treatment, which stimulated CYR61 expression, and verteporfin (VP) treatment, which inhibited CYR61 expression, confirmed that the enhancers regulated CYR61 expression. Knockdown and ectopic expression of CYR61 rescued cell migration changes induced by over-expressing and knockdown of FOXA1, respectively.CYR61 enhancer activation, mediated by FOXA1 and CBP, occurs during CRC progression to up-regulate CYR61 expression and promote cell migration in CRC, suggesting inhibition of recruitment of FOXA1 and/or CBP to CYR61 enhancers may have therapeutic implications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24854101>Clove extract inhibits tumor growth and promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Cloves (Syzygium aromaticum) have been used as a traditional Chinese medicinal herb for thousands of years. Cloves possess antiseptic, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties, but their potential anticancer activity remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects and biological mechanisms of ethyl  extract of cloves (EAEC) and the potential bioactive components responsible for its antitumor activity. The effects of EAEC on cell growth, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis were investigated using human  cell lines. The molecular changes associated with the effects of EAEC were analyzed by Western blot and (qRT)-PCR analysis. The in vivo effect of EAEC and its bioactive component was investigated using the HT-29 tumor xenograft model. We identified oleanolic acid (OA) as one of the components of EAEC responsible for its antitumor activity. Both EAEC and OA display cytotoxicity against several human  cell lines. Interestingly, EAEC was superior to OA and the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil at suppressing growth of  tumor xenografts. EAEC promoted G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with EAEC and OA selectively increased protein expression of p21(WAF1/Cip1) and γ-H2AX and downregulated expression of cell cycle-regulated proteins. Moreover, many of these changes were at the mRNA level, suggesting transcriptional regulation by EAEC treatment. Our results demonstrate that clove extract may represent a novel therapeutic herb for the treatment of colorectal , and OA appears to be one of the bioactive components.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24369485>Antioxidant Capacity, Cytotoxicity, and Acute Oral Toxicity of Gynura bicolor.</a></h2><p>Gynura bicolor (Compositae) which is widely used by the locals as natural remedies in folk medicine has limited scientific studies to ensure its efficacy and nontoxicity. The current study reports the total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, cytotoxicity, and acute oral toxicity of crude methanol and its fractionated extracts (hexane, ethyl , and water) of G. bicolor leaves. Five human  cell lines (HT-29, HCT-15, SW480, Caco-2, and HCT 116), one human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF7), and one human normal  cell line (CCD-18Co) were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of G. bicolor. The present findings had clearly demonstrated that ethyl  extract of G. bicolor with the highest total phenolic content among the extracts showed the strongest antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging assay and metal chelating assay), possessed cytotoxicity, and induced apoptotic and necrotic cell death, especially towards the HCT 116 and HCT-15  cells. The acute oral toxicity study indicated that methanol extract of G. bicolor has negligible level of toxicity when administered orally and has been regarded as safe in experimental rats. The findings of the current study clearly established the chemoprevention potential of G. bicolor and thus provide scientific validation on the therapeutic claims of G. bicolor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25312134>Evaluation of antioxidant, in vitro cytotoxicity of micropropagated and naturally grown plants of Leptadenia reticulata (Retz.) Wight & Arn.-an endangered medicinal plant.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the antioxidant and anti proliferative potential of different solvent extract of micropropagated and naturally grown plants of Leptadenia reticulata against various  cell lines.In this study different extract were tested for cytotoxicity against human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7, human  adenocarcinoma grade II cell line HT-29 and non  skeletal muscle cell line L6 through 3-(4, 5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. The total antioxidant potential was estimated by three different antioxidant model diphenylpicrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging activity, H2O2 scavenging activity and FeCl3 reducing activity.The ethyl  extract of both naturally grown plant and tissue cultured plant exhibited significant cytotoxicity with IC50 values of 21 µg/mL, 26 µg/mL and 22 µg/mL; 20 µg/mL, 30 µg/mL and 18 µg/mL respectively against three cell lines. The diphenylpicrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging activity was found to be highest with IC50 value of 267.13 µg/mL in ethyl  extract. The methanolic extract exhibited moderate antioxidant activity with IC50 value of 510.15 µg/mL. A highly positive correlation was observed between the antioxidant potential and cytotoxic activity of the plant.The strong cytotoxicity of ethyl  extract revealed anti carcinogenic potential of the plant which supports its traditional use as medicine. The present investigation is new to literature till date and will provide better scientific basis for future pharmacological, in vivo studies and novel source of pure bioactive compounds having anti  properties in this plant.Copyright © 2014 Hainan Medical College.

Initial studies with butyrate demonstrated that this compound significantly increased expression of Ah-responsive genes such as Cyp1a1/CYP1A1 in YAMC mouse colonocytes and Caco-2 human  cell lines. Butyrate synergistically enhanced AhR ligand-induced Cyp1a1/CYP1A1 in these cells with comparable enhancement being observed for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and also microbiota-derived AhR ligands tryptamine, indole and 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA). The effects of butyrate on enhancing induction of Cyp1b1/CYP1B1, AhR repressor (Ahrr/AhRR) and TCDD-inducible poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (Tiparp/TiPARP) by AhR ligands were gene- and cell context-dependent with the Caco-2 cells being the most responsive cell line. Like butyrate and propionate, the prototypical hydroxyamic acid-derived histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors Panobinostat and Vorinostat also enhanced AhR ligand-mediated induction and this was accompanied by enhanced histone acetylation.  also enhanced basal and ligand-inducible Ah responsiveness and histone acetylation, demonstrating that  was an HDAC inhibitor. These results demonstrate SCFA-AhR ligand interactions in YAMC and Caco-2 cells where SCFAs synergistically enhance basal and ligand-induced expression of AhR-responsive genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31266879>Fecal Short-Chain Fatty Acids Are Not Predictive of  Tumor Status and Cannot Be Predicted Based on Bacterial Community Structure.</a></h2><p> bacterial populations are thought to have a role in the development of colorectal  with some protecting against inflammation and others exacerbating inflammation. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and are produced in large quantities by  bacteria that produce SCFAs by fermenting fiber. We assessed whether there was an association between fecal SCFA concentrations and the presence of  adenomas or carcinomas in a cohort of individuals using 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic shotgun sequence data. We measured the fecal concentrations of , propionate, and butyrate within the cohort and found that there were no significant associations between SCFA concentration and tumor status. When we incorporated these concentrations into random forest classification models trained to differentiate between people with healthy colons and those with adenomas or carcinomas, we found that they did not significantly improve the ability of 16S rRNA gene or metagenomic gene sequence-based models to classify individuals. Finally, we generated random forest regression models trained to predict the concentration of each SCFA based on 16S rRNA gene or metagenomic gene sequence data from the same samples. These models performed poorly and were able to explain at most 14% of the observed variation in the SCFA concentrations. These results support the broader epidemiological data that questions the value of fiber consumption for reducing the risks of colorectal . Although other bacterial metabolites may serve as biomarkers to detect adenomas or carcinomas, fecal SCFA concentrations have limited predictive power. Considering that colorectal  is the third leading -related cause of death within the United States, it is important to detect colorectal tumors early and to prevent the formation of tumors. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are often used as a surrogate for measuring gut health and for being anticarcinogenic because of their anti-inflammatory properties. We evaluated the fecal SCFA concentrations of a cohort of individuals with different  tumor burdens who were previously analyzed to identify microbiome-based biomarkers of tumors. We were unable to find an association between SCFA concentration and tumor burden or use SCFAs to improve our microbiome-based models of classifying people based on their tumor status. Furthermore, we were unable to find an association between the fecal community structure and SCFA concentrations. Our results indicate that the association between fecal SCFAs, the gut microbiome, and tumor burden is weak.Copyright © 2019 Sze et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23978504>Transporters and receptors for short-chain fatty acids as the molecular link between  bacteria and the host.</a></h2><p>The mutually beneficial relationship between  bacteria and the host has been recognized but the molecular aspects of the relationship remain poorly understood.

The GSLs hydrolytic products are volatile compounds, which are known to exhibit bioactivities like antioxidant, fungicidal, bioherbicidal and anticancer. Among the Brassicaceae family,  is very well known for high content of GSLs. In the present study, the isolation of volatile oil of  var. raya was done by hydrodistillation method using clevenger apparatus and further there extraction was done by solvents ethyl  and dichloromethane. The volatile compounds present in the extract were analysed by gas chromatography/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/GC-MS). Fatty acid esters, sulphur and/or nitrogen compounds, carbonyl compounds and some other volatile compounds were also identified. Besides the analytical studies, the extracts were analysed for their bioactivities including radical scavenging activity by using DNA nicking assay and cytotoxic effect using different human  cell lines viz. breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), prostate (PC-3), lung (A-549), cervix (HeLa) and  (HCT116) by MTT assay. The oil extracts were efficiently able to reduce the increase of  cells in a dose-dependent manner. Among all cell lines, the most effective anticancer activity was observed in case of breast (MCF-7)  cell line. So, MCF-7 cells were used for further mechanistic studies for analysing the mechanism of anticancer activity. Confocal microscopy was done for analysing morphological changes in the cells and the images confirmed the features typical of apoptosis. For evaluating the mode of cell death, spectrofluorometric determination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was done. The volatile oil extract treated MCF-7 cells had a significant increase in number of ROS, also there was a rise in percentage of cells with increased disruption of MMP. So, the present study marks necessary indication that  (raya) oil extracts significantly induces apoptosis in all the above mentioned  cells lines through a ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway and thus play a remarkable role in death of  cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30510485>Proapoptotic and Antimigratory Effects of  and  on  Cell Lines.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study is to investigate cytotoxic, proapoptotic, antimigratory and pro-antioxidant effects of methanol, acetone and ethyl  extracts of lichens  and  on colorectal  (HCT-116 and SW-480) cell lines. We compared the cytotoxic effects on colorectal  cells with the effects obtained from normal human fibroblast (MRC-5) cell line. Tetrazolium (MTT) test evaluated the cytotoxic effects, Transwell assay evaluated cell migration, acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) fluorescent method followed the apoptosis, while prooxidant/antioxidant effects were determined spectrophotometrically through concentration of redox parameters. The tested extracts showed considerable cytotoxic effect on  cells with no observable cytotoxic effect on normal cells. Ethyl  and acetone extract of  induced the highest cytotoxicity (IC=(21.2±1.3) µg/mL on HCT-116, and IC=(51.3±0.8) µg/mL on SW-480 cells, respectively, after 72 h), with noteworthy apoptotic and prooxidant effects, and antimigratory potential of methanol extract.  extracts induced cytotoxic effects on HCT-116 cells after 72 h (IC<40 μg/mL), while only methanol and acetone extracts had cytotoxic effects on SW-480 cells after 24 h, with proapoptotic/necrotic activity, as a consequence of induced oxidative stress. In conclusion, lichen extracts changed to a great extent cell viability and migratory potential of colorectal  cell lines. HCT-116 cells were more sensitive to treatments,  had better proapoptotic and antimigratory effects, and both investigated lichen species might be a source of substances with anticancer activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28539711>Flavonoids Isolated From the Flowers of  and their  Antitumor Evaluation.</a></h2><p>, a halophytic species, can grow in saline or saline-alkali soil, is well known as a traditional Chinese medicine.

In addition, affinity for TSPO (IC50 = 18.64 nM), cellular uptake (ca. 2 times greater than that of oxaliplatin in LoVo  cells, after 24 h treatment), and perturbation of cell cycle progression were investigated. Although the new compound was less active than oxaliplatin and did not exploit a synergistic proapoptotic effect due to the presence of the TSPO ligand, it appears to be promising in a receptor-mediated drug targeting context towards TSPO-overexpressing tumors, in particular colorectal  (IC50 = 2.31 μM after 72 h treatment).</p></html>
