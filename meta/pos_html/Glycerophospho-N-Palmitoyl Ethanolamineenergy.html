Liquid hot water (LHW) pretreatment is a truly green pretreatment due to its zero chemical use, but has the disadvantages of low lignin removal and pseudo-lignin formation. A modified liquid hot water (MLHW) process based on in situ synthesis of deep eutectic solvent (DES) could efficiently improve delignification of Roystonea regia leaves (LR) and leaf sheaths (LSR). LSR was less recalcitrant than LR, and its characteristics of higher porosity (34.8%) and thinner cell walls (5.2 μm) for LSR contributed it higher lignin removal (53.6%) and lower choline chloride (ChCl) consumption (HO-ChCl mass ratio of 2:1) than those (44.6% and 1:2) from LR. Moreover, a great improvement of 309.0% in bio-methane yield was achieved for the MLHW-treated LSR. In addition, in situ DES in MLHW had good biocompatibility with cellulase, microalgae, and yeast.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The major problem of sNRIs lines in their delayed onset of action and partial- or non-responses, which makes NDRIs distinguished in drug efficacy. Understanding of the differential binding modes of these 2 types of drugs to their corresponding targets can give great insights into the discovery of privileged drug-like scaffolds with improved efficacy. So far, no such study has been carried out.A combinatorial computational strategy, integrating homology modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) and binding free  calculation, was employed to analyze the binding modes of 8 clinically important ADHD drugs in their targets.Binding modes of 2 types of ADHD drugs (sNRIs and NDRIs) in their targets was identified for the first time by MD simulation, and 15 hot spot residues were discovered as crucial for NDRIs' binding in hNET and hDAT. Comparing to sNRIs, a clear reduction in the hydrophobic property of NDRIs' one functional group was observed, and the depth of drugs' aromatic ring stretched into the pocket of both targets was further identified as key contributors to drugs' selectivity.The hydrophobic property of NDRI ADHD drugs' one functional group contributes to their selectivity when bind hNET and hDAT.These results provide insights into NDRI ADHD drugs' binding mechanisms, which could be utilized as structural blueprints for assessing and discovering more efficacious drugs for ADHD therapy.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although genetically encoded PKA sensors have been developed, single-cell imaging of PKA activity in living mice has not been established. Here, we used two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (2pFLIM) to visualize genetically encoded PKA sensors in response to the neuromodulators norepinephrine and dopamine. We screened available PKA sensors for 2pFLIM and further developed a variant (named tAKARα) with increased sensitivity and a broadened dynamic range. This sensor allowed detection of PKA activation by norepinephrine at physiologically relevant concentrations and kinetics, and by optogenetically released dopamine. In vivo longitudinal 2pFLIM imaging of tAKARα tracked bidirectional PKA activities in individual neurons in awake mice and revealed neuromodulatory PKA events that were associated with wakefulness, pharmacological manipulation, and locomotion. This new sensor combined with 2pFLIM will enable interrogation of neuromodulation-induced PKA signaling in awake animals. VIDEO ABSTRACT.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The present work is undertaken to investigate the protective effect of the ethanolic extract of Azolla microphylla (EAM) against the Isoproterenol (ISO) induced cardiotoxicity in rats. Rats were pre-treated with EAM (250 and 500mg/kg b.w.) for 28 days along with ISO (85mg/kg; s.c.) on the 29th and 30th days. ISO-induced rats displayed significant diminution in cardiac antioxidant enzymes activities, increased lipid peroxidation and alteration in cardiac marker enzymes. The same group also displayed an increase in levels of serum lipid profiles and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) accompanied with a significant reduction in the anti-inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-10). Moreover, the histopathological investigations in the heart tissue of ISO-induced group exhibited myocardial necrosis and inflammation, which correlated with the increased immunoreactivity for Bax/iNOS, whereas an absence of reactivity for Bcl-2 proteins. However, in EAM pre-treated rats, the activities of antioxidant enzymes, cardiac marker enzymes, membrane-bound ATPases together with the levels of lipid profile, non-enzymatic antioxidants, pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines were maintained at normalcy that was further supported by improving histopathological changes and myocardial architecture. The IHC results of EAM pre-treated rats indicate up-regulated and down-regulated expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax/iNOS proteins, respectively. Thus, the present study reveals that A. microphylla alleviates myocardial damage in ISO-induced cardiac injury and demonstrates cardioprotective potential which could be attributed to its potent antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity. A possible mechanism for the protective effect is the elevated expression of endogenous antioxidant defense enzymes, anti-inflammatory cytokines, degraded lipid peroxidation products and improved  metabolism of cardiac mitochondria, thus attenuating necrosis of the myocytes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

When corrosion occurs in pipelines, equipment, and containers in petrochemical enterprises, minute amounts of metal ions are released. In this study, the thermal decomposition and nonisothermal kinetics of monoethanolamine (MEA) and MEA mixed with copper and zinc ions were analyzed using thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The TG tests revealed that MEA mixed with copper (II) and zinc (II) began thermal decomposition at 75.2 and 60.3 °C, respectively, whereas pure MEA began thermal decomposition at 89.7 °C. Two exothermic peaks were observed in the DSC curves for MEA mixed with copper (II) and zinc (II), and thermokinetic parameters were obtained from DSC data. The apparent activation  (E) of each stage was calculated using several nonisothermal kinetic methods, namely the ASTM E698, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose, Starink, and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa methods. The E of pure MEA was 28.7 ± 2.5 kJ/mol, whereas that of the copper and zinc mixtures were 80.5 ± 1.1 and 46.8 ±1.7 kJ/mol, respectively. The results can be used to improve the intrinsic safety of storage tanks and petrochemical plants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28414329>Alternatively activated macrophages do not synthesize catecholamines or contribute to adipose tissue adaptive thermogenesis.</a></h1><p>Adaptive thermogenesis is the process of heat generation in response to cold stimulation. It is under the control of the sympathetic nervous system, whose chief effector is the catecholamine norepinephrine (NE). NE enhances thermogenesis through β3-adrenergic receptors to activate brown adipose tissue and by 'browning' white adipose tissue. Recent studies have reported that alternative activation of macrophages in response to interleukin (IL)-4 stimulation induces the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a key enzyme in the catecholamine synthesis pathway, and that this activation provides an alternative source of locally produced catecholamines during the thermogenic process. Here we report that the deletion of Th in hematopoietic cells of adult mice neither alters  expenditure upon cold exposure nor reduces browning in inguinal adipose tissue. Bone marrow-derived macrophages did not release NE in response to stimulation with IL-4, and conditioned media from IL-4-stimulated macrophages failed to induce expression of thermogenic genes, such as uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1), in adipocytes cultured with the conditioned media. Furthermore, chronic treatment with IL-4 failed to increase  expenditure in wild-type, Ucp1 and interleukin-4 receptor-α double-negative (Il4ra) mice. In agreement with these findings, adipose-tissue-resident macrophages did not express TH. Thus, we conclude that alternatively activated macrophages do not synthesize relevant amounts of catecholamines, and hence, are not likely to have a direct role in adipocyte metabolism or adaptive thermogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29552726>α- and α-Adrenoceptors as Potential Targets for Dopamine and Dopamine Receptor Ligands.</a></h1><p>The poor norepinephrine innervation and high density of Gi/o-coupled α- and α-adrenoceptors in the striatum and the dense striatal dopamine innervation have prompted the possibility that dopamine could be an effective adrenoceptor ligand. Nevertheless, the reported adrenoceptor agonistic properties of dopamine are still inconclusive. In this study, we analyzed the binding of norepinephrine, dopamine, and several compounds reported as selective dopamine D-like receptor ligands, such as the D receptor agonist 7-OH-PIPAT and the D receptor agonist RO-105824, to α-adrenoceptors in cortical and striatal tissue, which express α-adrenoceptors and both α- and α-adrenoceptors, respectively. The affinity of dopamine for α-adrenoceptors was found to be similar to that for D-like and D-like receptors. Moreover, the exogenous dopamine receptor ligands also showed high affinity for α- and α-adrenoceptors. Their ability to activate Gi/o proteins through α- and α-adrenoceptors was also analyzed in transfected cells with bioluminescent resonance  transfer techniques. The relative ligand potencies and efficacies were dependent on the Gi/o protein subtype. Furthermore, dopamine binding to α-adrenoceptors was functional, inducing changes in dynamic mass redistribution, adenylyl cyclase activity, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Binding events were further studied with computer modeling of ligand docking. Docking of dopamine at α- and α-adrenoceptors was nearly identical to its binding to the crystallized D receptor. Therefore, we provide conclusive evidence that α- and α-adrenoceptors are functional receptors for norepinephrine, dopamine, and other previously assumed selective D-like receptor ligands, which calls for revisiting previous studies with those ligands.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29982159>Derivative synchronous spectrofluorimetry: Application to the analysis of two binary mixtures containing codeine in dosage forms.</a></h1><p>Two binary mixtures containing codeine (COD) with either ibuprofen (IBU), mixture 1, or with phenylephrine hydrochloride (PE), mixture 2, were analyzed using three simple eco-friendly spectrofluorimetric methods without the need to a prior separation step. The first method is derivative emission spectrofluorimetry using λ = 236 nm and 275 nm for mixtures 1 and 2, respectively. The second method is constant-wavelength synchronous spectrofluorimetry using ∆λ = 100 nm and 60 nm for mixtures 1 and 2, respectively. The last method is constant- synchronous spectrofluorimetry where a wave number interval of -7000 cm was used for the analysis of the two binary mixtures. All measurements were performed in acetate buffer pH 5 and thus no toxic volatile solvents were used increasing method greenness. High sensitivity was attained for the three studied drugs where the lower limits of quantitation of COD, IBU and PE reached 0.064, 0.512 and 0.087 μg/mL, respectively. Analysis of the two binary mixtures in their tablet and liquid dosage forms was performed with good accuracy and precision using the developed methods. The results of the proposed and reported methods were statistically evaluated using one-way ANOVA test and no significant difference among them was obtained. In addition, all aspects of ICH guidelines on analytical method validation were conducted.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here, using a chemically defined medium, two regulatory factors that affect EA utilization were examined. First, the functional consequences of loss of the small RNA (sRNA) EutX on the efficacy of EA utilization were investigated. One effect observed, as loss of this negative regulator causes an increase in  gene expression, was a concomitant increase in the number of catabolic acterial icroompartments (BMCs) formed. However, despite this increase, the growth of the strain was repressed, suggesting that the overall efficacy of EA utilization was negatively affected. Second, utilizing a deletion mutant and a complement, carbon catabolite control protein A (CcpA) was shown to be responsible for the repression of EA utilization in the presence of glucose. A predicted  site in one of the three EA-inducible promoters, , was identified as the target of CcpA. However, CcpA was shown to affect the activation of all the promoters indirectly through the two-component system EutV and EutW, whose genes are under the control of the  promoter. Moreover, a bioinformatics analysis of bacteria predicted to contain CcpA and  sites revealed that a preponderance of BMC-containing operons are likely regulated by carbon catabolite repression (CCR).

In this work, we investigated two regulatory factors that control this process. One factor, a small RNA (sRNA), is shown to be important for generating the right levels of gene expression for maximum efficiency. The second factor, a transcriptional repressor, is important for preventing expression when other preferred sources of  are available.

The effect of prolonged caloric restriction on ECs in relation to fat distribution and cardiac function is still unknown. Therefore, our aim was to investigate this relationship in obese T2D patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).In a prospective intervention study, obese T2D patients with CAD (n = 27) followed a 16 week very low calorie diet (VLCD; 450-1000 kcal/day). Cardiac function and fat accumulation were assessed with MRI and spectroscopy. Plasma levels of lipid species, including ECs, were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.VLCD decreased plasma levels of virtually all measured lipid species of the class of N-acylethanolamines including the EC anandamide (AEA; -15%, p = 0.016), without decreasing monoacylglycerols including the EC 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Baseline plasma AEA levels strongly correlated with the volume of subcutaneous white adipose tissue (SAT; R = 0.44, p < 0.001). VLCD decreased the volume of SAT (-53%, p < 0.001), visceral white adipose tissue (VAT) (-52%, p < 0.001), epicardial white adipose tissue (-15%, p < 0.001) and paracardial white adipose tissue (-28%, p < 0.001). VLCD also decreased hepatic (-86%, p < 0.001) and myocardial (-33%, p < 0.001) fat content. These effects were accompanied by an increased left ventricular ejection fraction (54.8 ± 8.7-56.2 ± 7.9%, p = 0.016).Caloric restriction in T2D patients with CAD decreases AEA levels, but not 2-AG levels, which is paralleled by decreased lipid accumulation in adipose tissue, liver and heart, and improved cardiovascular function. Interestingly, baseline AEA levels strongly correlated with SAT volume. We anticipate that dietary interventions are worthwhile strategies in advanced T2D, and that reduction in AEA may contribute to the improved cardiometabolic phenotype induced by weight loss.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001937>Bronchial Thermoplasty in Patients with Severe Uncontrolled Asthma: First Korean Cases.</a></h1><p>Bronchial thermoplasty is a nonpharmacological treatment for severe asthma that delivers thermal  to the bronchial walls and reduces hypertrophied smooth muscle mass. Previous studies have shown its efficacy and safety, resulting in approval from the Food and Drug Administration in 2010. In Korea, the first bronchial thermoplasty was carried out in 2014; 4 patients have undergone the procedure so far. This case series presents the medical history and treatment outcomes of these 4 patients. All patients presented with uncontrolled asthma despite optimal medical treatment. Bronchial thermoplasty was performed at the right lower lobe, left lower lobe, and both upper lobes in order at 3-week intervals. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia. Two patients had significant decreases in exacerbations and required a lower dose of inhaled corticosteroids after the procedure. One patient had slightly fewer exacerbations but failed to reduce the use of systemic corticosteroids. One patient had no change in symptoms. One limitation of bronchial thermoplasty is the difficulty of predicting clinical responders. However, since more therapeutic options are needed in the management of severe asthma, especially T2-low asthma, discussion with experts about the feasibility and necessity of bronchial thermoplasty will ensure the best possible care.© 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30871207>Study of Catalytic CO₂ Absorption and Desorption with Tertiary Amine DEEA and 1DMA-2P with the Aid of Solid Acid and Solid Alkaline Chemicals.</a></h1><p>Studies of catalytic CO₂ absorption and desorption were completed in two well-performed tertiary amines: diethylmonoethanolamine (DEEA) and 1-dimethylamino-2-propanol (1DMA-2P), with the aid of CaCO₃ and MgCO₃ in the absorption process, and with the aid of γ-Al₂O₃ and H-ZSM-5 in the desorption process. The batch process was used for CO₂ absorption with solid alkalis, and the recirculation process was used for CO₂ desorption with solid acid catalysts. The CO₂ equilibrium solubility and pKa were also measured at 293 K with results comparable to the literature. The catalytic tests discovered that the heterogeneous catalysis of tertiary amines on both absorption and desorption sides were quite different from monoethanolamine (MEA) and diethanolamine (DEA). These results were illustrative as a start-up to further study of the kinetics of heterogeneous catalysis of CO₂ to tertiary amines based on their special reaction schemes and base-catalyzed hydration mechanism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28941830>Experimental and computational study of the effect of breath-actuated mechanism built in the NEXThaler dry powder inhaler.</a></h1><p>The breath-actuated mechanism (BAM) is a mechanical unit included in NEXThaler with the role of delaying the emission of the drug until the inhalation flow rate of the patient is sufficiently high to detach the drug particles from their carriers. The main objective of this work was to analyse the effect of the presence of BAM on the size distribution of the emitted drug and its airway deposition efficiency and distribution. Study of the hygroscopic growth of the emitted drug particles and its effect on the deposition was another goal of this study. Size distributions of Foster NEXThaler drug particles emitted by dry powder inhalers with and without BAM have been measured by a Next Generation Impactor. Three characteristic inhalation profiles of asthmatic patients (low, moderate and high flow rates) were used for both experimental and modelling purposes. Particle hygroscopic growth was determined by a new method, where experimental measurements are combined with simulations. Upper airway and lung deposition fractions were computed assuming 5s and 10s breath-hold times. By the inclusion of BAM the fine particle fraction of the steroid component increased from 24 to 30% to 47-51%, while that of bronchodilator from 25-34% to 52-55%. The predicted upper airway steroid and bronchodilator doses decreased from about 60% to 35-40% due to BAM. At the same time, predicted lung doses increased from about 20%-35% (steroid) and from 22% to 38% (bronchodilator) for the moderate flow profile and from about 25% to 40% (steroid) and from 29% to 47% (bronchodilator) for the high inhalation flow profile. Although BDP and FF upper airway doses decreased by a factor of about two when BAM was present, lung doses of both components were about the same in the BAM and no-BAM configurations at the weakest flow profile. However, lung dose increased by 2-3% even for this profile when hygroscopic growth was taken into account. In conclusion, the NEXThaler BAM mechanism is a unique feature enabling high emitted fine particle fraction and enhanced drug delivery to the lungs.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

NAFLD is generally exhibited by non-progressive simple steatosis. However, a significant subset of patient's progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that is defined by the presence of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte injury with fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD or NASH and therefore therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Niclosamide is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anthelmintic drug that mediates its effect by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Niclosamide and its salt forms, Niclosamide  (NEN), and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have shown efficacy in murine models of diet induced obesity characterized by attenuation of the prominent fatty liver disease phenotype and improved glucose metabolism. While the exact mechanism(s) underlying these changes remains unclear, the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased  expenditure and lipid metabolism or attenuation of PKA mediated glucagon signaling in the liver have been proposed. Unfortunately, niclosamide has very poor water solubility, leading to low oral bioavailability. This, in addition to mitochondrial uncoupling activity and potential genotoxicity have reduced enthusiasm for its clinical use. More recently, salt forms of niclosamide, NEN and NPP, have demonstrated improved oral bioavailability while retaining activity. This suggests that development of safer more effective niclosamide derivatives for the treatment of NAFLD and Type 2 Diabetes may be possible. Herein we explored the ability of a series of N-substituted phenylbenzamide derivatives of the niclosamide salicylanilide chemotype to attenuate hepatic steatosis using a novel phenotypic in vitro model of fatty liver and the high fat diet-fed mouse model of diet induced obesity. These studies identified novel compounds with improved pre-clinical properties that attenuate hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. These compounds with improved drug properties may be useful in alleviating symptoms and protection against disease progression in patients with metabolic syndrome and NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30879673>Preparation, characterization and application of rod-like chitin nanocrystal by using p-toluenesulfonic acid/choline chloride deep eutectic solvent as a hydrolytic media.</a></h1><p>Chitin nanocrystal (ChiNC) was fabricated based on p-toluenesulfonic acid -choline chloride deep eutectic solvent treatment.

To determine the impact acetate supplementation has on a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, we quantified the effect treatment had on injury progression, spinal cord lipid content, phospholipase levels, and myelin structure in mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). EAE was induced by inoculating mice with a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide fragment (MOG ), and acetate supplementation was maintained with 4 g/kg glyceryl triacetate by a daily oral gavage. Acetate supplementation prevented the onset of clinical signs in mice subject to EAE compared to control-treated mice. Furthermore, acetate supplementation prevented the loss of spinal cord  and choline glycerophospholipid and phosphatidylserine in mice subjected to EAE compared to EAE animals treated with water. Treatment increased saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid levels in phosphatidylserine compared to controls suggesting that acetate was utilized to increase spinal cord fatty acid content. Also, acetate supplementation prevented the loss of spinal cord cholesterol in EAE animals but did not change cholesteryl esters. Treatment significantly increased GD3 and GD1a ganglioside levels in EAE mice when compared to EAE mice treated with water. Treatment returned levels of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated cytosolic phospholipase A (cPLA ) levels back to baseline and based on FluoroMyelin™ histochemistry maintained myelin structural characteristics. Overall, these data suggest that acetate supplementation may modulate lipid metabolism in mice subjected to EAE.© 2017 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28521971>Comparison of early sequential hypothermia and delayed hypothermia on neurological function after resuscitation in a swine model.</a></h1><p>We utilized a porcine cardiac arrest model to compare early sequential hypothermia (ESH) with delayed hypothermia (DH) and no hypothermia (NH) to investigate the different effects on cerebral function after resuscitation.After return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), resuscitated 24 pigs divided into three groups. The ESH group implemented early sequential hypothermia immediately, and the DH group implemented delayed hypothermia at 1 h after ROSC. The core temperature, hemodynamic parameters and oxygen metabolism were recorded. Cerebral metabolism variables and neurotransmitter in the extracellular fluid were collected through the microdialysis tubes. The bloods were analyzed for venous jugular bulb oxygen saturation, lactate and neuron specific nolase. The cerebral function was evaluated using the cerebral performance category and neurologic deficit score at 72h after ROSC and cerebral histology in the right posterior frontal lobe were collected.ESH reached the target temperature earlier and showed more favorable outcomes of neurological function than DH. Specifically, early sequential hypothermia reduced cerebral oxygen and  consumption and decreased extracellular accumulation of neurotransmitters after resuscitation and protected the integrity of the BBB during reperfusion.Early sequential hypothermia could increase the protection of neurological function after resuscitation and produce better neurological outcomes.

The abundance of E. faecalis in the intestine of silkworm is affected by fluoride exposure. However, the response mechanism of E. faecalis toward fluoride remains largely unknown. In this study, a strain of E. faecalis (named TV4), which is a symbiotic bacteria of silkworm, was isolated and characterized. Inhibition assay showed that fluoride could significantly inhibit the growth of the TV4 strain (P<0.05) after culture for 4 h. Finally, Illumina X-Ten platform was used to investigate the response mechanism of E. faecalis TV4 under fluoride exposure. We found that the TV4 strain demonstrated significant changes in its carbohydrate transport and metabolism and  metabolism. The transcriptome sequencing results revealed that 237 genes were differentially expressed for TV4 grown after fluoride exposure, i.e., 92 genes were differentially up-regulated and 145 genes were differentially down-regulated. Many of the down-regulated genes were involved in cell carbohydrate transport and metabolism and  production, whereas the up-regulated genes were mostly related to  utilization and amino acid synthesis and metabolism. Our results revealed that strain TV4 reduced its carbohydrate metabolism and  metabolism and increased  utilization and amino acid metabolism to adapt and survive under fluoride exposure. This study enhances our understanding about the response mechanism of E. faecalis after fluoride exposure and has important implications for investigations on the three-way interaction among fluoride, symbiotic bacteria and silkworm.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Membrane damage is often identified as a major mechanism of this toxicity. Prior efforts to strengthen the microbial membrane by changing the phospholipid distribution have largely focused on the fatty acid tails. Herein, a novel strategy of phospholipid head engineering is demonstrated in Escherichia coli. Specifically, increasing the expression of phosphatidylserine synthase (+pssA) was found to significantly increase both the tolerance and production of octanoic acid, a representative membrane-damaging solvent. Tolerance of other industrially-relevant inhibitors, such as furfural, acetate, toluene, ethanol and low pH was also increased. In addition to the increase in the relative abundance of the phosphoethanolamine (PE) head group in the +pssA strain, there were also changes in the fatty acid tail composition, resulting in an increase in average length, percent unsaturation and decreased abundance of cyclic rings. This +pssA strain had significant changes in: membrane integrity, surface potential, electrochemical potential and hydrophobicity; sensitivity to intracellular acidification; and distribution of the phospholipid tails, including an increase in average length and percent unsaturation and decreased abundance of cyclic rings. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the +PE membrane had increased resistance to penetration of ethanol into the hydrophobic core and also the membrane thickness. Further hybrid models in which only the head group distribution or fatty acid tail distribution was altered showed that the increase in PE content is responsible for the increase in bilayer thickness, but the increased hydrophobic core thickness is due to altered distribution of both the head groups and fatty acid tails. This work demonstrates the importance of consideration of the membrane head groups, as well as a modeling approach, in membrane engineering efforts.Copyright © 2017 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

The pungent component of mustard, allyl-isothiocyanate (AITC), activates the extreme cold receptor transient receptor potential channel, subfamily A, member 1 and may thus induce  expenditure and metabolic changes. The objective of our study was to evaluate the potential of mustard AITC to induce thermogenesis (primary outcome) and alter body temperature, cold and hunger sensations, plasma metabolic parameters, and  intake (secondary outcomes).  expenditure in mice was measured after subcutaneous injection with vehicle, 1 mg norepinephrine/kg, or 5 mg AITC/kg.

Subjects were randomly selected for the placebo and capsulated mustard intervention; 9 of 11 subjects received the uncapsulated mustard as the final intervention because this could not be blinded. After the experiments,  intake was measured with the universal eating monitor in a test meal. In mice, AITC administration induced a 32% increase in  expenditure compared with vehicle (17.5 ± 4.9 J · min · mouse compared with 12.5 ± 1.2 J · min · mouse,  = 0.03). Of the 11 randomly selected participants, 1 was excluded because of intercurrent illness after the first visit and 1 withdrew after the second visit.  expenditure did not increase after ingestion of capsulated or uncapsulated mustard compared with placebo. No differences in substrate oxidation, core temperature, cold and hunger scores, or plasma parameters were found, nor was the  intake at the end of the experiment different between the 3 conditions. The highest tolerable dose of mustard we were able to use did not elicit a relevant thermogenic response in humans.

Adrenergic hormones are known to stimulate metabolism in adult mammals and are essential for embryonic development, but relatively little is known about their effects on metabolism in the embryonic heart. Here, we show that embryos lacking adrenergic stimulation have ∼10-fold less cardiac ATP compared with littermate controls. Despite this deficit in steady-state ATP, neither the rates of ATP formation nor degradation was affected in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts, suggesting that ATP synthesis and hydrolysis mechanisms were fully operational. We thus hypothesized that adrenergic hormones stimulate metabolism of glucose to provide chemical substrates for oxidation in mitochondria. To test this hypothesis, we employed a metabolomics-based approach using LC/MS. Our results showed glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate concentrations were not significantly altered, but several downstream metabolites in both glycolytic and pentose-phosphate pathways were significantly lower compared with controls. Furthermore, we identified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase as key enzymes in those respective metabolic pathways whose activity was significantly ( < 0.05) and substantially (80 and 40%, respectively) lower in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts. Addition of pyruvate and to a lesser extent ribose led to significant recovery of steady-state ATP concentrations. These results demonstrate that without adrenergic stimulation, glucose metabolism in the embryonic heart is severely impaired in multiple pathways, ultimately leading to insufficient metabolic substrate availability for successful transition to aerobic respiration needed for survival.© 2018 Peoples et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28752649>Safety, Efficacy, and Mechanistic Studies Regarding Citrus aurantium (Bitter Orange) Extract and p-Synephrine.</a></h1><p>Citrus aurantium L. (bitter orange) extracts that contain p-synephrine as the primary protoalkaloid are widely used for weight loss/weight management, sports performance, appetite control, , and mental focus and cognition. Questions have been raised about the safety of p-synephrine because it has some structural similarity to ephedrine. This review focuses on current human, animal, in vitro, and mechanistic studies that address the safety, efficacy, and mechanisms of action of bitter orange extracts and p-synephrine. Numerous studies have been conducted with respect to p-synephrine and bitter orange extract because ephedra and ephedrine were banned from use in dietary supplements in 2004. Approximately 30 human studies indicate that p-synephrine and bitter orange extracts do not result in cardiovascular effects and do not act as stimulants at commonly used doses. Mechanistic studies suggest that p-synephrine exerts its effects through multiple actions, which are discussed. Because p-synephrine exhibits greater adrenergic receptor binding in rodents than humans, data from animals cannot be directly extrapolated to humans. This review, as well as several other assessments published in recent years, has concluded that bitter orange extract and p-synephrine are safe for use in dietary supplements and foods at the commonly used doses.Copyright © 2017 The Authors Phytotherapy Research Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100914>Powder flow analysis: A simple method to indicate the ideal amount of lactose fines in dry powder inhaler formulations.</a></h1><p>Many efforts have been made in the past to understand the function of lactose fines which are given as a ternary component to carrier-based dry powder inhaler formulations. It is undisputed that fines can significantly improve the performance of such formulations, but choosing the right amount of fines is a crucial point, because too high concentrations can have negative effects on the dispersion performance. The aim of this study was to indicate the optimal concentration of fines with a simple test method. For this purpose, mixtures with salbutamol sulfate and two different lactose carriers were prepared with a high shear mixer, measured with a FT4 powder rheometer and tested for fine particle delivery with two different inhaler devices. A correlation between the fluidization , measured with the aeration test set up, and the fine particle fractions (FPF) could be proven. This also applied for the aeration ratio, as well as the permeability of the powder samples. In addition, drug-free mixtures hardly differed in their rheological properties from mixtures containing the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), which indicates that the method could be suitable for cost-saving screening trials. Furthermore, important aspects that explain the function of fines, such as the saturation of active sites, the formation of agglomerates and an increase in fluidization , could be shown in this study.Copyright © 2017.

We first examined whether SNS activity toward discrete adipose depots changes in response to a weight loss diet in mice. We found that SNS activity toward each adipose depot is unique in timing, pattern of activation, and habituation with the most dramatic contrast between visceral and subcutaneous adipose depots. Sympathetic drive toward visceral epididymal adipose is more than doubled early in weight loss and then suppressed later in the diet when weight loss plateaued. Coincident with the decline in SNS activity toward visceral adipose is an increase in activity toward subcutaneous depots indicating a switch in lipolytic sources. In response to calorie restriction, SNS activity toward retroperitoneal and brown adipose depots is unaffected. Finally, pharmacological blockage of sympathetic activity on adipose tissue using the β3-adrenergic receptor antagonist, SR59230a, suppressed loss of visceral adipose mass in response to diet. These findings indicate that SNS activity toward discrete adipose depots is dynamic and potentially hierarchical. This pattern of sympathetic activation is required for  liberation and loss of adipose tissue in response to calorie-restricted diet.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29860242>Gut microbiota metabolites, amino acid metabolites and improvements in insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism: the POUNDS Lost trial.</a></h1><p>Alterations in gut microbiota have been linked to host insulin resistance, diabetes and impaired amino acid metabolism. We investigated whether changes in gut microbiota-dependent metabolite of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and its nutrient precursors (choline and L-carnitine) were associated with improvements in glucose metabolism and diabetes-related amino acids in a weight-loss diet intervention.We included 504 overweight and obese adults who were randomly assigned to one of four -reduced diets varying in macronutrient intake. The 6-month changes (Δ) in TMAO, choline and L-carnitine levels after the intervention were calculated.Greater decreases in choline and L-carnitine were significantly (p<0.05) associated with greater improvements in fasting insulin concentrations and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at 6 months. The reduction of choline was significantly related to 2-year improvements in glucose and insulin resistance. We found significant linkages between dietary fat intake and ΔTMAO for changes in fasting glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR (p <0.05); a greater increase in TMAO was related to lesser improvements in the outcomes among participants who consumed a high-fat diet. In addition, ΔL-carnitine and Δcholine were significantly related to changes in amino acids (including branched-chain and aromatic amino acids). Interestingly, the associations of ΔTMAO, Δcholine and ΔL-carnitine with diabetes-related traits were independent of the changes in amino acids.Our findings underscore the importance of changes in TMAO, choline and L-carnitine in improving insulin sensitivity during a weight-loss intervention for obese patients. Dietary fat intake may modify the associations of TMAO with insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism..© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2019.

We explored the role of glycogen as a fuel source for neuromodulation using the noradrenergic stimulation of glia in a computational model of the neural-glial-vasculature ensemble (NGV). The detection of norepinephrine (NE) by the astrocyte and the coupled cAMP signal are rapid and largely insensitive to the distance of the locus coeruleus projection release sites from the glia, implying a diminished impact for volume transmission in high affinity receptor transduction systems. Glucosyl-conjugated units liberated from glial glycogen by NE-elicited cAMP second messenger transduction winds sequentially through the glycolytic cascade, generating robust increases in NADH and ATP before pyruvate is finally transformed into lactate. This astrocytic lactate is rapidly exported by monocarboxylate transporters to the associated neuron, demonstrating that the astrocyte-to-neuron lactate shuttle activated by glycogenolysis is a likely fuel source for neuromodulation and enhanced neural activity. Altogether, the  supply for both astrocytes and neurons can be supplied rapidly by glycogenolysis upon neuromodulatory stimulus.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29886099>Effect of delayed pMDI actuation on the lung deposition of a fixed-dose combination aerosol drug.</a></h1><p>Lack of coordination between the beginning of the inhalation and device triggering is one of the most frequent errors reported in connection with the use of pMDI devices. Earlier results suggested a significant loss in lung deposition as a consequence of late actuation. However, most of our knowledge on the effect of poor synchronization is based on earlier works on CFC devices emitting large particles with high initial velocities. The aim of this study was to apply numerical techniques to analyse the effect of late device actuation on the lung dose of a HFA pMDI drug emitting high fraction of extrafine particles used in current asthma and COPD therapy. A computational fluid and particle dynamics model was combined with stochastic whole lung model to quantify the amount of drug depositing in the extrathoracic airways and in the lungs. High speed camera measurements were also performed to characterize the emitted spray plume. Our results have shown that for the studied pMDI drug late actuation leads to reasonable loss in terms of lung dose, unless it happens in the second half of the inhalation period. Device actuation at the middle of the inhalation caused less than 25% lung dose reduction relative to the value characterizing perfect coordination, if the inhalation time was between 2 and 5 s and inhalation flow rate between 30 and 150 L/min. This dose loss is lower than the previously known values of CFC devices and further support the practice of triggering the device shortly after the beginning of the inhalation instead of forcing a perfect synchronization and risking mishandling and poor drug deposition.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is largely responsible for the degradation of NAEs. However, at high concentrations of  and unesterified fatty acids, FAAH can also catalyze the reverse reaction, producing NAEs. Several brain insults such as ischemia and hypoxia increase brain unesterified fatty acids. Because FAAH can catalyze the synthesis of NAE, we aimed to test whether FAAH was necessary for CO -induced hypercapnia/ischemia increases in NAE. To test this, we examined levels of NAEs, 1- and 2-arachidonoylglycerols as well as their corresponding fatty acid precursors in wild-type and mice lacking FAAH (FAAH-KO) with three Kill methods: (i) head-focused, high- microwave irradiation (microwave), (ii) 5 min CO followed by microwave irradiation (CO + microwave), and (iii) 5 min CO only (CO ). Both CO -induced groups increased, to a similar extent, brain levels of unesterified oleic, arachidonic, and docosahexaenoic acid and 1- and 2-arachidonoylglycerols compared to the microwave group in both wild-type and FAAH-KO mice. Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA), and docosahexaenoylethanolamide (DHEA) levels were about 8-, 7-, and 2.5-fold higher, respectively, in the FAAH-KO mice compared with the wild-type mice. Interestingly, the concentrations of OEA, AEA, and DHEA increased 2.5- to 4-fold in response to both CO -induced groups in wild-type mice, but DHEA increased only in the CO group in FAAH-KO mice. Our study demonstrates that FAAH is necessary for CO - induced increases in OEA and AEA but not DHEA. Targeting brain FAAH could impair the production of NAEs in response to brain injuries.© 2017 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28687925>Locus coeruleus.</a></h1><p>The locus coeruleus (LC) contains norepinephrine (NE)-synthesizing neurons that send diffuse projections throughout the central nervous system. The LC-NE system has a major role in arousal, attention and stress responses. In the brain, NE may also contribute to long-term synaptic plasticity, pain modulation, motor control,  homeostasis and control of local blood flow. The LC is severely affected in neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson disease (PD). Involvement of the noradrenergic neurons of the LC precedes that of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and has been increasingly recognized as a potential major contributor to cognitive manifestations in early PD, particularly impaired attention. Abnormal noradrenergic signaling may also potentially contribute to motor manifestations of the disease.This makes the LC-NE system a major contributor to the pathobiology and potential target for therapy of PD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28856768>Meat and nutritional quality comparison of purebred and crossbred pigs.</a></h1><p>Crossbreeding is an effective method of improving the efficiency and profit of production in commercial pig operations. To understand the effect of crossbreeding on meat and nutrient quality, a combination including three purebred (Duroc, D; Landrace, L; Yorkshire, Y) and two crossbred pig lines (Landrace × Yorkshire, LY; Duroc × (Landrace × Yorkshire), DLY) frequently used internationally were studied. The results showed that meat from the LY and DLY crosses had lower values for lightness L24h∗, shear force and epinephrine and higher values for drip loss, C18:1, insulin, glucagon and monounsaturated fatty acids than D, L and Y pigs. Moreover, LY had higher values for post mortem pH and lower values for a* and b* than the purebreds. In contrast, DLY had lower values for pH and higher values for a* and b* than the purebreds. Meat quality-related gene analysis showed that the CAST, IGF2 and MC4R gene expression levels in the LY and DLY pigs were significantly higher than those in the D, L and Y pigs. These results indicate that crossbreeding can alter the meat quality, nutritive value,  metabolism and gene expression of pigs.

In this work, a novel choline chloride-acrylic acid (ChCl-AA) DES polymer, on a 2D magnetic base, was prepared for the recognition of β-lactoglobulin (β-LG) biomacromolecules in milk and for the inhibition of common bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas fluorescens (P. fluorescens), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis). The ChCl-AA DESs were polymerized on the surface of 2D MoS sheets doped with nano FeO particles, and the resulting polymer was abbreviated poly(ChCl-AA DES)@FeO@MoS. The free  (ΔG=-92) of ChCl-AA DES was calculated using the Gaussian software, the composition and structure of poly(ChCl-AA DES)@FeO@MoS were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, etc., the qualitative and quantitative analyses of β-LG were done by fluorescence spectra, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and high performance liquid chromatography, and the bioactivity of bacteria was analyzed by flat colony counting. Based on the present analysis, poly(ChCl-AA DES)@FeO@MoS specifically recognized β-LG in a good fitting Langmuir isotherm (R = 0.9909) and second-order kinetic model (R = 0.9989) by affinity, and evidently inhibited three bacteria, namely, E. coil (65%), S. aureus (50%), and B. subtilis (54%), effectively reducing the relative colony number. As the poly(ChCl-AA DES)@FeO@MoS material did not only exhibit specific recognition of biomacromolecules, but also had an antimicrobial effect against common bacteria, it could be an ideal separation media or carrier for biomacromolecules in real samples.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Three-hundred-sixty 28-wk-old Hy-line W-36 laying hens were randomly allocated to one of the 5 dietary treatments, each treatment with 6 replicates of 12 birds each. All diets included 2% Schizochytrium powder (docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], 137.09 mg/g). The control group was not supplemented with any additional phospholipids, whereas the other 4 experimental diets were supplemented with 1,000 mg/kg choline (CHO), 1,000 mg/kg monoethanolamine (MEA), 1,000 mg/kg lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), or 500 mg/kg LPC + 500 mg/kg MEA (LPC + MEA). The experimental diets were isocaloric (metabolizable , 11.15 MJ/kg) and isonitrogenous (crude protein, 16.60%). The feeding trial lasted 28 days. Laying hen performance and egg quality were not affected (P > 0.05) by the diets used. The monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) level was reduced in the LPC group at d 28 (P < 0.01), whereas the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) level was increased (P < 0.05). The omega-6 (n-6) PUFA level of the egg yolks in the LPC group had a trend to increase in comparison to the control (P = 0.07). The CHO and LPC groups had higher omega-3 (n-3) PUFA and DHA levels and lower n-6/n-3 ratios than the other groups at d 28 (P < 0.01). The DHA content in egg yolk reached a plateau after the laying hens consumed the experimental diets for 14 days, and higher yolk DHA contents were observed in the CHO and LPC groups as compared with the other groups at d 14. It was concluded that dietary choline supplementation for more than 14 d enhanced egg yolk enrichment with n-3 PUFA and DHA when laying hen diets were supplemented with 2% Schizochytrium powder. All the diets had no adverse effect on hen performance, egg quality, or egg components under the experimental condition.© 2017 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30576736>Insight into impact of choline-based ionic liquids on bovine β-lactoglobulin structural analysis: Unexpected high thermal stability of protein.</a></h1><p>In this present work, we report the effects of different concentrations of various cholinium-based ionic liquids (ILs) on the structural and thermal stability of β-lactoglobulin (β-LG). Results indicated that anions in ILs have played an important role in affecting the thermal and structural stability of β-LG. Biomolecular interactions between β-LG and ILs are carried out by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), different spectroscopic and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Analysis of experimental data revealed that an excellent thermal stability of β-LG is obtained in presence of choline dihydrogen phosphate [Chn][Dhp] and choline bitartrate [Chn][Bit] where T value of β-LG increased to 93.58 and 93.22 °C, respectively, as compared to T of β-LG in buffer at 72.48 °C. Similarly, in presence of choline acetate [Chn][Ac] and choline chloride [Chn][Cl] thermal stability of β-LG also increased, however, it was not possible to calculate T values in case of choline iodide [Chn][I], because of obtaining two endothermic peaks in DSC curves. On the other hand, choline hydroxide [Chn][OH] acts as complete destabilizer for β-LG native structure as no T is obtained in its presence. The obtained results are further confirmed by estimating the thermodynamic parameters such as Gibbs free  of unfolding (ΔG), enthalpy of unfolding (ΔH), heat capacity change (ΔCp) and total entropy change during protein unfolding (ΔS). Molecular docking studies of β-LG and various choline-based ILs are also performed to know the probable binding conformations using AutoDock Vina and AutoDock tools 1.5.6, results obtained are in correlation with spectroscopic and biothermodynamic data. The combined study by DSC, spectroscopy techniques and molecular docking studies suggest that some of these ILs can be used as industrial green solvents for different biocatalytic processes and also can help in resolving the problems involving protein unfolding and thermal stability studies.Copyright © 2018.

AKI incidence has increased; however, its diagnosis has limitations and physiopathological mechanisms are underexplored. We investigated urine samples, aiming to identify major metabolite changes during human AKI evolution. Metabolic signatures found were further explored for a potential link to severity of injury. Twenty-four control subjects and 38 hospitalized patients with AKI were recruited and urine samples were collected at the time of diagnosis, during follow-up and at discharge. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used in a first discovery phase for identifying potential metabolic differences. Target metabolites of interest were confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in an independent group. Underlying metabolic defects were further explored by kidney transcriptomics of murine toxic AKI. Urinary 2-hydroxybutyric acid, pantothenic acid, and hippuric acid were significantly downregulated and urinary N-acetylneuraminic acid, phosphoethanolamine, and serine were upregulated during AKI. Hippuric acid, phosphoethanolamine, and serine showed further downregulation/upregulation depending on the metabolite in acute tubular necrosis (ATN) AKI compared to prerenal AKI. Kidney transcriptomics disclosed decreased expression of cystathionase, cystathionine-β-synthase, and -phosphate cytidylyltransferase, and increased N-acetylneuraminate synthase as the potentially underlying cause of changes in urinary metabolites. A urinary metabolite panel identified AKI patients and provided insight into intrarenal events. A urine fingerprint made up of six metabolites may be related to pathophysiological changes in oxidative stress,  generation, and HS availability associated with AKI.The urinary metabolome reflects AKI evolution and severity of injury.

However, evidence in humans is scarce. We aim to investigate the association between serum choline and betaine levels with body composition in general population.This is an observational cross-sectional study performed in 1081 subjects from the CODING (Complex Disease in Newfoundland population: Environment and Genetics) study. Serum choline and betaine levels were measured based on liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry technology. Body composition was measured using dual- X-ray absorptiometry following a 12-hour fast. Major confounding factors including age, sex, total calorie intake and physical activity level were controlled in all analyses.Significantly inverse correlations were found between serum betaine levels and all obesity measurements in males (r ranged from -0.12 to -0.23, and p<0.01 for all) but not in females. Serum choline was negatively associated with total percent body fat (%BF), percent trunk fat (%TF), weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (r ranged from -0.11 to -0.19, and p<0.05 for all) in males and positively associated with weight, BMI and WC (r ranged from 0.09 to 0.10, and p<0.05 for all) in females. The negative associations between serum choline and betaine levels with obesity in males were more profound in those not on any medication than those taking medications. Moreover, obese males had the lowest serum choline and betaine levels, followed by overweight males, and normal weight males having the highest serum choline and betaine levels, especially in those not taking medications (p<0.05). Likewise, subjects with the highest serum levels of both had the lowest obesity indexes, especially those not taking medications.Higher serum choline and betaine levels were associated with a more favorable body composition (lower body fat and higher lean body mass) in males and the favorable association was more pronounced in non-medication users.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29775125>Influence of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) on the microbial properties of anaerobic granular sludge acclimated to isoplophyl alcohol (IPA) wastewater under psychrophilic conditions.</a></h1><p>In this study, a continuous flow experiment was conducted in which a lab-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor at psychrophilic conditions (18-19°C) was fed with artificial wastewater, containing tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and isoplophyl alcohol (IPA), from the electronics industry. This was done to evaluate process performance and microbial properties of the granular sludge that was retained in the reactor. The inoculated granular sludge was precultured with IPA containing wastewater but not TMAH; as a result, no degradation was observed in 30 days of operation. To enhance degradation, the reactor was seeded with 2% weight of the TMAH-enriched sludge, after which TMAH was enhanced. Consequently, the total COD removal efficiency reached 90% at an organic loading rate of 7.5 kg COD/m/day. The TMAH inflow decreased the diameter of the retained granular sludge, but the sludge retained its settleability. The proliferation of the Methanometylovorans microorganisms present in the enrichment culture was confirmed by analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene in the retained sludge. In addition, TMAH degradation was inhibited by addition chloroform, a methanogen inhibitor. These results suggested species in the genus Methanometylovorans in the granular sludge contributed significantly to methanogenic TMAH degradation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28715671>Adipose triglyceride lipase protein abundance and translocation to the lipid droplet increase during leptin-induced lipolysis in bovine adipocytes.</a></h1><p>Proper regulation of lipid metabolism is critical for preventing the development of metabolic diseases. It is clear that leptin plays a critical role in the regulation of  homeostasis by regulating  intake. However, leptin can also regulate  homeostasis by inducing lipolysis in adipocytes, but it is unclear how the major lipases are involved in leptin-stimulated lipolysis. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine if (1) leptin acts directly to induce lipolysis in bovine adipocytes, (2) the potential lipases involved in leptin-induced lipolysis in bovine adipocytes, and (3) increases translocation of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) during leptin-stimulated lipolysis in bovine stromal vascular cell-derived adipocytes. As hypothesized, leptin induced a lipolytic response (P = 0.02) in isolated adipocytes which was accompanied by an increase in phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 (P = 0.03), a well-documented secondary messenger of leptin, and ATGL protein abundance (P < 0.01). Protein abundance of STAT3, perilipin, HSL, and phosphorylation of HSL by PKA and AMPK were not altered during leptin-stimulated lipolysis (P > 0.05). Immunostaining techniques were employed to determine the location of HSL and ATGL. Both lipases translocated to the lipid droplet after 2 h of exposure to isoproterenol (P < 0.02). However, only ATGL was translocated to the lipid droplet during leptin-stimulated lipolysis (P = 0.04), indicating ATGL may be the active lipase in leptin-stimulated lipolysis. In summary, leptin stimulates lipolysis in bovine adipocytes. The lack of phosphorylated HSL and translocation of HSL to the lipid droplet during leptin-stimulated lipolysis suggest minimal activity by PKA. Interestingly, leptin-stimulated lipolysis is accompanied by an increase in ATGL protein abundance and translocation to the lipid droplet, indicating its involvement in leptin-stimulated lipolysis either due to an increase in protein abundance or through a novel lipolytic cascade.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Due to their fast multiplication rates, algae can provide a sustainable supply of biomass, and are attractive because they do not compete with food crops for habitat. Here we show that biomass derived from Chlorella vulgaris and Spirulina platensis can be pretreated with low cost choline amino acid based ionic liquids to effectively yield lipids (30.6% and 51% total lipids) and sugars (71% and 26% total sugars). The ionic liquids dissolve the lipids, leaving behind a carbohydrate rich solid. The lipids were extracted with hexane, and the solid was subjected to enzyme hydrolysis to release fermentable sugars. These results open new pathways towards the dual production of biodiesel and bioethanol from algae, using low cost ionic liquids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28641546>Targeting Astrocytes for Treating Neurological Disorders: Carbon Monoxide and Noradrenaline-Induced Increase in Lactate.</a></h1><p>There are at least three reasons why brain astrocytes represent a new target for treating neurological disorders. First, although the human neocortex represents over 80% of brain mass, neurons are outnumbered by non-neuronal cells, including astrocytes, a neuroglial cell type. Second, as in neurons, vesicle-based release of transmitters is present in astrocytes, however with much slower kinetics than in neurons. Third, astrocytes contain glycogen, which can be transformed to L-lactate in glycolysis. L-lactate is considered to be a fuel and a signalling molecule involved in cognition and neuroprotection. The mechanisms of neuroprotection are unclear but may be linked to carbon monoxide, a product of the heme oxygenase, an evolutionarily conserved cellular cytoprotectant. Increased levels of local carbon monoxide arising from heme oxygenase activity may increase L-lactate, but direct measurements of cytosolic L-lactate are lacking. A fluorescence resonance  transfer-based nanosensor selective for L-lactate was used to monitor cytosolic levels of L-lactate while cultured astrocytes were exposed to carbon monoxide. The results revealed that in astrocytes exposed to carbon monoxide there is no significant increase in L-lactate, however, when noradrenaline, a potent glycogenolytic agent, is applied, cytosolic levels of Llactate are increased, but strongly attenuated in astrocytes pretreated with carbon monoxide. These first measurements of carbon monoxide-modulated L-lactate levels in astrocytes provide evidence that the L-lactate and heme oxygenase neuroprotective systems may interact. In conclusion, not only the abundance of astrocytes but their signalling capacity using vesicles and metabolites, such as L-lactate, are valid targets for neurological disorders.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28241996>Ginkgo biloba extract alleviates oxidative stress and some neurotransmitters changes induced by aluminum chloride in rats.</a></h1><p>In the present study, twenty four adult male albino rats were classified into four groups. The control group received normal diet and water; the second group was treated daily with oral dose of Ginkgo biloba (200 mg/kg body weight [b.wt]) for 3 mo; the third group was treated daily with oral dose of aluminum chloride (10 mg/kg b.wt) for 3 mo; and the fourth group was treated with both Ginkgo biloba and aluminum chloride (200 and 10 mg/kg b.wt, respectively) using a stomach tube for 3 mo. The results showed that administration of AlCl to rats induced significant increase (P < 0.05) in thiobarbituric acid reactive substance and decrease (P < 0.05) in glutathione, catalase, and superoxide dismutase in brain and testis homogenates. The data also showed significant decrease (P < 0.05) in noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin (5-HT) levels in brain tissue. The rats administered AlCl showed significant decrease (P < 0.05) in serum zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu), significant increase (P < 0.05) in serum iron (Fe), and non-significant decrease in magnesium (Mg). Furthermore, significant increase (P < 0.05) in serum alkaline phosphatase and acid phosphatase and significant decrease (P < 0.05) in testosterone were recorded. The histologic examination showed some degenerative changes in both brain and testis tissues while significant improvement in biochemical and histologic changes were observed in the aluminum chloride plus Ginkgo biloba group. It could be concluded that the protective effect of Ginkgo biloba may be attributed to its antioxidant properties.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Recent studies have demonstrated that white and brown adipocytes also function as endocrine cells and regulate systemic metabolism by secreting factors that act locally and systemically. However, a comparative proteomic analysis of secreted factors from white and brown adipocytes and their responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation has not been reported yet. Therefore, we studied and compared the secretome of white and brown adipocytes, with and without norepinephrine (NE) stimulation. Our results reveal that carbohydrate-metabolism-regulating proteins are preferably secreted from white adipocytes, while brown adipocytes predominantly secrete a large variety of proteins. Upon NE stimulation, an increased secretion of known adipokines is favored by white adipocytes while brown adipocytes secreted higher amounts of novel adipokines. Furthermore, the secretory response between NE-stimulated and basal state was multifaceted addressing lipid and glucose metabolism, adipogenesis, and antioxidative reactions. Intriguingly, NE stimulation drastically changed the secretome in brown adipocytes. In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive catalogue of novel adipokine candidates secreted from white and brown adipocytes with many of them responsive to NE. Given the beneficial effects of brown adipose tissue activation on its endocrine function and systemic metabolism, this study provides an archive of novel batokine candidates and biomarkers for activated brown adipose tissue.© 2018 Ali Khan et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31363868>Effect of Roughness on the Dispersion of Dry Powders for Inhalation: a Dynamic Visualization Perspective.</a></h1><p>Dry powder inhalers have attracted more interest over the years in every aspect related to them. Interestingly, when focusing on the effects of particle morphology of the active or carrier (excipient), it is generally regarded particle size and shape to influence drug availability of aerosolized particles. However, to date, few studies have examined the effect of texture, i.e., roughness, on this relationship. The main objective of the present work is to gain a closer understanding of the influence of carrier morphology on the aerosolization performance of dry powder inhaler formulations. Image analysis and microscopy were used to visualize the aerosolization process. It is considered that the scale of morphological features on the surface of the carrier particles is responsible for the dispersion of the powder formulation, separation of the drug/carrier, and entrainment from a dry powder inhaler. Thus, for this study, the carrier particles of different surface roughness were mixed with micronized salbutamol sulphate. Aerosolization in vitro testing was used to evaluate the performance. The results indicate a connection between the qualitative surface roughness of coarse carriers and aerosolization performance during powder dispersibility. This investigation demonstrated that indeed, powder dispersion, a dynamic process, is influenced by the scale of the carrier morphology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29730527>Evolutionary analysis of the carnitine- and choline acyltransferases suggests distinct evolution of CPT2 versus CPT1 and related variants.</a></h1><p>Carnitine/choline acyltransferases play diverse roles in  metabolism and neuronal signalling. Our knowledge of their evolutionary relationships, important for functional understanding, is incomplete. Therefore, we aimed to determine the evolutionary relationships of these eukaryotic transferases. We performed extensive phylogenetic and intron position analyses. We found that mammalian intramitochondrial CPT2 is most closely related to cytosolic yeast carnitine transferases (Sc-YAT1 and 2), whereas the other members of the family are related to intraorganellar yeast Sc-CAT2. Therefore, the cytosolically active CPT1 more closely resembles intramitochondrial ancestors than CPT2. The choline acetyltransferase is closely related to carnitine acetyltransferase and shows lower evolutionary rates than long chain acyltransferases. In the CPT1 family several duplications occurred during animal radiation, leading to the isoforms CPT1A, CPT1B and CPT1C. In addition, we found five CPT1-like genes in Caenorhabditis elegans that strongly group to the CPT1 family. The long branch leading to mammalian brain isoform CPT1C suggests that either strong positive or relaxed evolution has taken place on this node. The presented evolutionary delineation of carnitine/choline acyltransferases adds to current knowledge on their functions and provides tangible leads for further experimental research.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Due to the highly stable two-dimensional layer structure, large surface area and pore volume, graphene materials were seemed as ideal carrier for enzyme immobilization. In this paper, pristine few layer graphene (FLG) was applied to interact with laccase to synthesize laccase-graphene composite and the results of AFM, FT-IR and adsorption isotherm suggested that laccase was loaded on the FLG with a very high loading dosage (221.1 mg g). Based on the measured interaction force and binding type between laccase and graphene, we proposed that the great enzyme loading on FLG is likely due to the non-covalent π-π stacking in addition to the large surface area of FLG. The composite has better stability to the variance of pH and storage temperature than free laccase. The synthesized composite can effectively transform beta-blocker labetalol with an enhanced efficiency, though the possible reaction pathways kept not changing. We further performed molecular simulation study on the crystal structure variation of laccase binding on FLG and proposed that catalytic activity enhancement may be attributed to the more exposure extent of the catalytic center of laccase. In addition, the laccase-graphene composite can be reused more than ten times in catalyzing the labetalol removal.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Seventeen healthy subjects volunteered to participate in a double-blind and randomised experimental design composed of four identical experimental trials. On four trials separated by 72 h, participants ingested a placebo or 1, 2 or 3 mg/kg of p-synephrine. After resting for 60 min to allow substance absorption, participants performed an exercise test of increasing intensity on a cycle ergometer while gas exchange was measured continuously. None of the doses of p-synephrine affected  expenditure or heart rates during the test. The highest rate of fat oxidation with the placebo (0.35 ± 0.05 g/min) was reached at 38.0 ± 1.9% of VO . The ingestion of 1 mg/kg increased maximal fat oxidation to 0.47 ± 0.11 g/min (p = 0.01) but did not change the intensity at which it was obtained (42.0 ± 9.4% of VO ). The ingestion of 2 and 3 mg/kg of p-synephrine increased maximal fat oxidation to 0.55 ± 0.14 g/min (p < 0.01), although only 3 mg/kg slightly changed the intensity at which it was obtained (43.0 ± 9.5% of VO , p < 0.01).

In the nematode , the biogenic amines serotonin (5-HT) and octopamine regulate a number of food-related behaviors. Using a novel method for long-term quantitative behavioral imaging, we show that 5-HT and octopamine jointly influence locomotor activity and quiescence in feeding and fasting hermaphrodites, and we define the neural circuits through which this modulation occurs. We show that 5-HT produced by the ADF neurons acts via the SER-5 receptor in muscles and neurons to suppress quiescent behavior and promote roaming in fasting worms, whereas 5-HT produced by the NSM neurons acts on the MOD-1 receptor in AIY neurons to promote low-amplitude locomotor behavior characteristic of well fed animals. Octopamine, produced by the RIC neurons, acts via SER-3 and SER-6 receptors in SIA neurons to promote roaming behaviors characteristic of fasting animals. We find that 5-HT signaling is required for animals to assume food-appropriate behavior, whereas octopamine signaling is required for animals to assume fasting-appropriate behavior. The requirement for both neurotransmitters in both the feeding and fasting states enables increased behavioral adaptability. Our results define the molecular and neural pathways through which parallel biogenic amine signaling tunes behavior appropriately to nutrient conditions. Animals adjust behavior in response to environmental changes, such as fluctuations in food abundance, to maximize survival and reproduction. Biogenic amines, such as like serotonin, are conserved neurotransmitters that regulate behavior and metabolism in relation to  status. Disruptions of biogenic amine signaling contribute to human neurological diseases of mood, appetite, and movement. In this study, we investigated the roles of the biogenic amines serotonin and octopamine in regulating locomotion behaviors associated with feeding and fasting in the roundworm  We identified neural circuits through which these signals work to govern behavior. Understanding the molecular pathways through which biogenic amines function in model organisms may improve our understanding of dysfunctions of appetite and behavior found in mammals, including humans.Copyright © 2017 the authors 0270-6474/17/377811-13$15.00/0.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30771961>Ratio fluorometric determination of ATP base on the reversion of fluorescence of calcein quenched by Eu(III) ion using carbon dots as reference.</a></h1><p>A kind of nitrogen doped carbon dots (NCDs) with excellent stable luminescence performance was prepared by pyrolysis using  as precursor. By simply mixing solution of NCDs and calcein-Eu, a ratio fluorometric probe with carbon dots as "internal reference" and calcein-Eu as recognition group was constructed for ATP detection. The fluorescence of the calcein can be selectively quenched by Eu, and can be restored when ATP was added because Eu ions exhibit higher affinity to the oxygen-donor atoms originated from phosphates than that from carboxylate groups. Meanwhile, fluorescence of NCDs was not affected by Eu, calcein or ATP. By adding NCDs as "internal reference" in the above system, a new ratiometric strategy for detecting ATP was conducted. The dynamic linear range for ATP detection was 5.0 × 10 mol L~ 2.0 × 10 mol L, and the detection limit was 2.0 × 10 mol L.The method was successfully applied to detecting ATP in adenosine disodium triphosphate injection.

Physical (sprinting, jumping) and technical (shooting, dribbling) performance was assessed.Blood glucose and plasma insulin (both P < 0.001) concentrations varied by trial with isomaltulose maintaining > 13% higher blood glucose concentrations between 75 and 90 min versus maltodextrin (P < 0.05). A decline in glycaemia at 60 min in maltodextrin was attenuated with isomaltulose (-19 versus -4%; P = 0.015). Carbohydrates attenuated elevations in plasma epinephrine concentrations (P < 0.05), but isomaltulose proved most effective at 90 and 120 min. Carbohydrates did not attenuate IL-6 increases or reductions in physical or technical performances (all P > 0.05).

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of two lipotropic factors (choline and carnitine) on growth performance, oxidative stability of leg and breast muscles and carcass characteristics in broiler chickens fed diets differing in metabolisable  (ME) levels. 2. A total of 540 one-d-old Ross 308 broiler chicks were allotted to 9 experimental diets, including three ME levels (control, or 0.42 or 0.84 MJ/kg higher ME) and three types of supplemental lipotropic factors (control, 1000 mg/kg of choline or 100 mg/kg of carnitine) as a 3 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments. Average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were recorded during the starter (1-14 d of age), grower (15-28 d of age) and finisher (29-42 d of age) periods. 3. Results showed that the increase in dietary ME level had no impact on ADFI during the starter and grower periods. In the finisher period, increasing dietary ME decreased (P < 0.001) ADFI. Raising dietary ME level by 0.84 MJ/kg resulted in the greater ADG during the grower (P < 0.05) and finisher (P < 0.001) periods. Moreover, an improvement in FCR was observed with feeding the +0.84 MJ/kg diet. Dietary supplementation of lipotropic factors improved FCR values in birds fed the control and +0.84 MJ/kg diets during the grower and finisher periods (P < 0.01). 4. Dietary supplementation of both choline and carnitine increased (P < 0.05) moisture content of leg muscle, although malondialdehyde content of leg muscle was decreased (P < 0.01) in the presence of both lipotropic factors. Dietary supplementation of carnitine decreased (P < 0.01) leg fat content, and this effect was more obvious with higher ME levels, giving a significant ME × lipotrope interaction (P < 0.05). Higher dietary ME level (+0.84 MJ/kg) reduced (P < 0.05) protein content of breast muscle, but this factor was increased (P < 0.05) by dietary supplementation of choline. 5. Although dietary ME level had no marked effect on carcass yield and internal organ weight, supplemental choline increased (P < 0.01) carcass yield. 6. The results from this trial indicated that dietary supplementation with lipotropic factors can improve feed efficiency in high  diets.

NT‑PGC‑1α exhibits stronger anti‑obesity effects in adipose tissue than PGC‑1α; however, NT‑PGC‑1α has not yet been investigated in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). The present study aimed to investigate the role of NT‑PGC‑1α in mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism and its possible regulatory mechanism in NRCMs. NRCMs were exposed to phenylephrine (PE) or angiotensin II (Ang II) to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Following this, NRCMs were infected with adenovirus expressing NT‑PGC‑1α, and adenosine 5'‑triphsophate (ATP) levels, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial membrane potential were subsequently detected. In addition, western blotting, lipid droplet staining and oxygen consumption assays were performed to examine the function of NT‑PGC‑1α in fatty acid metabolism. NT‑PGC‑1α was demonstrated to be primarily expressed in the cytoplasm, which differed from full‑length PGC‑1α, which was predominantly expressed in the nucleus. NT‑PGC‑1α overexpression alleviated mitochondrial function impairment, including ATP generation, ROS production and mitochondrial membrane potential integrity. Furthermore, NT‑PGC‑1α overexpression alleviated the PE‑induced suppression of fatty acid metabolism‑associated protein expression, increased extracellular oxygen consumption and decreased lipid droplet accumulation in NRCMs. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that NT‑PGC‑1α alleviated PE‑induced mitochondrial impairment and decreased lipid droplet accumulation in NRCMs, indicating that NT‑PGC‑1α may have ameliorated mitochondrial  defects in NRCMs, and may be considered as a potential target for the treatment of heart failure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30445039>Food Perception Primes Hepatic ER Homeostasis via Melanocortin-Dependent Control of mTOR Activation.</a></h1><p>Adaptation of liver to the postprandial state requires coordinated regulation of protein synthesis and folding aligned with changes in lipid metabolism. Here we demonstrate that sensory food perception is sufficient to elicit early activation of hepatic mTOR signaling, Xbp1 splicing, increased expression of ER-stress genes, and phosphatidylcholine synthesis, which translate into a rapid morphological ER remodeling. These responses overlap with those activated during refeeding, where they are maintained and constantly increased upon nutrient supply. Sensory food perception activates POMC neurons in the hypothalamus, optogenetic activation of POMC neurons activates hepatic mTOR signaling and Xbp1 splicing, whereas lack of MC4R expression attenuates these responses to sensory food perception. Chemogenetic POMC-neuron activation promotes sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) subserving the liver, and norepinephrine evokes the same responses in hepatocytes in vitro and in liver in vivo as observed upon sensory food perception. Collectively, our experiments unravel that sensory food perception coordinately primes postprandial liver ER adaption through a melanocortin-SNA-mTOR-Xbp1s axis.

Is the reduced signalling of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of  homeostasis in the heart, responsible for the reduced β-adrenergic responsiveness of the heart in obesity? What is the main finding and its importance? Inhibition of AMPK in isolated hearts prevented the reduced cardiac β-adrenergic responsiveness of obese rats, which was accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of AMPK, a proxy of AMPK activity. This suggests a direct functional link between β-adrenergic responsiveness and AMPK signalling in the heart, and it suggests that AMPK might be an important target to restore the β-adrenergic responsiveness in the heart in obesity.The obesity epidemic impacts heavily on cardiovascular health, in part owing to changes in cardiac metabolism. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key regulator of  homeostasis in the heart and is regulated by β-adrenoceptors (β-ARs) in normal conditions. In obesity, chronic sympathetic overactivation leads to impaired cardiac β-AR responsiveness, although it is unclear whether AMPK signalling, downstream of β-ARs, contributes to this dysfunction. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether reduced AMPK signalling is responsible for the reduced β-AR responsiveness in obesity. In isolated hearts of lean and obese Zucker rats, we tested β-AR responsiveness to the β -AR agonist isoprenaline (ISO, 1 × 10 to 5 × 10  m) in the absence and presence of the AMPK inhibitor, compound C (CC, 10 μm). The β -AR expression and AMPK phosphorylation were assessed by Western blot. β-Adrenergic responsiveness was reduced in the hearts of obese rats (logEC of ISO-developed pressure dose-response curves: lean -8.53 ± 0.13 × 10  m versus obese -8.35 ± 0.10 × 10  m ; P < 0.05 lean versus obese, n = 6 per group). This difference was not apparent after AMPK inhibition (logEC of ISO-developed pressure curves: lean CC -8.19 ± 0.12 × 10  m versus obese CC 8.17 ± 0.13 × 10  m, P < 0.05, n = 6 per group). β -Adrenergic receptor expression and AMPK phosphorylation were reduced in hearts of obese rats (AMPK at Thr : lean 1.73 ± 0.17 a.u. versus lean CC 0.81 ± 0.13 a.u., and obese 1.18 ± 0.09 a.u. versus obese CC 0.81 ± 0.16 a.u., P < 0.05, n = 6 per group). Thus, a direct functional link between β-adrenergic responsiveness and AMPK signalling in the heart exists, and AMPK might be an important target to restore the reduced cardiac β-adrenergic responsiveness in obesity.© 2018 The Authors.

The molecular control of brown adipocyte differentiation and function has been extensively studied in mice, but relatively little is known about such regulatory mechanisms in humans, which in part is due to lack of human brown adipose tissue derived cell models. Here, we used retrovirus-mediated overexpression to stably integrate human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) into stromal-vascular cell fractions from deep and superficial human neck adipose tissue biopsies from the same donor. The brown and white pre-adipocyte cell models (TERT-hBA and TERT-hWA, respectively) displayed a stable proliferation rate and differentiation until at least passage 20. Mature TERT-hBA adipocytes expressed higher levels of thermogenic marker genes and displayed a higher maximal respiratory capacity than mature TERT-hWA adipocytes. TERT-hBA adipocytes were UCP1-positive and responded to β-adrenergic stimulation by activating the PKA-MKK3/6-p38 MAPK signaling module and increasing thermogenic gene expression and oxygen consumption. Mature TERT-hWA adipocytes underwent efficient rosiglitazone-induced 'browning', as demonstrated by strongly increased expression of UCP1 and other brown adipocyte-enriched genes. In summary, the TERT-hBA and TERT-hWA cell models represent useful tools to obtain a better understanding of the molecular control of human brown and white adipocyte differentiation and function as well as of browning of human white adipocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29447836>Sensory denervation of inguinal white fat modifies sympathetic outflow to white and brown fat in Siberian hamsters.</a></h1><p>White adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) have sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and sensory innervations. Previous studies from our laboratory revealed central neuroanatomical evidence of WAT sensory and BAT SNS crosstalk with double labeling of inguinal WAT (IWAT) sensory and interscapular BAT (IBAT) SNS neurons. We previously demonstrated that WAT lipolysis increases IBAT temperature, but this effect is absent when IWAT afferents are surgically denervated, which severs both sensory and SNS nerves. It is possible that WAT sensory feedback can regulate SNS drive to itself and other WAT and BAT depots, and thus contribute to the existence of differential SNS outflow to fat during different  challenges. Here we selectively denervated IWAT sensory nerves in Siberian hamsters using capsaicin and measured norepinephrine turnover (NETO) i.e., SNS drive to WAT and BAT depots, IBAT uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression, body mass, fat mass, blood glucose, and food consumed after a 24-h cold exposure. IWAT sensory denervation decreased both IWAT and IBAT NETO and IBAT UCP1 expression. IWAT sensory denervation, however, increased mesenteric WAT (MWAT) NETO after the 24-h cold exposure and did not modify epididymal WAT (EWAT) and retroperitoneal WAT (RWAT) NETO compared with respective controls. Body mass, fat mass, blood glucose, and food consumed were unchanged across groups. RWAT and EWAT mass decreased in capsaicin-injected hamsters, but did not in the vehicle hamsters. These results functionally demonstrate the existence of IWAT sensory and IBAT SNS crosstalk and that a disruption in this sensory-SNS feedback mechanism modifies SNS drive to IWAT, IBAT, and MWAT, but not EWAT and RWAT.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNT) were successfully functionalized with the aid of nitric acid and confirmed by the Raman spectral data. Functionalized carbon nanotubes (fCNT) were dispersed in chitosan solution and the resulting bio-nanocomposite was used for the fabrication of sensor surface by drop and cast method. Electrochemical characteristics of the fabricated sensor were understood using cyclic, differential pulse voltammetry (CV, DPV) and electrochemical impedance analysis for the detection of Epn in phosphate buffer (pH7.4). CV and impedance analysis revealed that the Chit-fCNT modified electrode enhances the electrodic reaction of Epn and facilitated the electron transfer more readily compared to that of bare electrode. Applying DPV for the detection of Epn, achieved 30nM as the lowest detection limit in the determination range of 0.05-10μM and the analytical time as low as 10s. Selective determination of Epn against the coexistence of a number of biological electroactive interferents and reproducible results for the determination of Epn were demonstrated. The present biosensor has been found efficient for successful direct determination of Epn from pharmaceutical adrenaline formulations and urine samples.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Pregnant, nonlactating multiparous Holstein cows (n = 77) were blocked by body condition score (3.59 ± 0.33) and assigned to treatment at 64 ± 10 d before calculated calving date. Dietary treatments were top-dressing of 0, 30, 60, 90, or 120 g/d of ruminally protected choline (RPC; Balchem Corp., New Hampton, NY) ions to supply the equivalent of 0, 6.5, 12.9, 19.4, and 25.8 g/d of choline ions. Diets were formulated to exceed nutrient requirements for maintenance and pregnancy and fed in ad libitum amounts for the first 5 d. From d 6 to 15, cows were restricted to consume approximately 31% of their net  requirements to simulate early lactating cows in negative  balance. Methionine intake was maintained throughout each 15-d period. Liver was biopsied at 5 and 14 d and analyzed for TAG and glycogen. Blood was sampled on d 5 and 14 and plasma analyzed for glucose, insulin, cholesterol, β-hydroxybutyrate, long-chain fatty acids, and haptoglobin. On d 14, a mixture of saturated long-chain fatty acids, ground corn, and dried molasses (50:37:13) was offered (908 g, as-is basis) 10 h after the single daily feeding. Blood samples were collected for 19 h and plasma analyzed for TAG and cholesterol to assess apparent absorption of dietary fat. Mean dry matter intake and  balance decreased from means of 9.5 to 3.3 kg/d and from 0.6 to -9.2 Mcal of net  for lactation/d during the ad libitum and restricted feeding periods, respectively. Plasma concentrations of the lipid-soluble choline biomolecules, namely total phosphatidylcholines, total lysophosphatidylcholines, and sphingomyelin, increased with choline supplementation. Feed restriction increased plasma concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate and free long-chain fatty acids, whereas those of glucose, insulin, and total cholesterol decreased. During feed restriction, concentration of hepatic TAG and plasma haptoglobin decreased linearly, whereas concentration of hepatic glycogen tended to increase quadratically with increasing intake of RPC. After fat supplementation, mean plasma concentration of TAG increased by an average of 21% with intake of RPC ions, peaking at intakes of ≥6.5 g/d of RPC ion. In summary, feeding RPC ions to cows in negative  balance had increasing lipotropic effects on the liver when consumed up to 25.8 g/d, whereas feeding only 6.5 g/d increased concentrations of hepatic glycogen and TAG in the blood.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

However, scientific information is lacking about the effects of combining these substances on substrate oxidation during exercise. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the isolated and combined effects of p-synephrine and caffeine on fat oxidation rate during exercise.In a double-blind randomized experiment, 13 healthy subjects participated in four experimental trials after the ingestion of a capsule containing a placebo, 3 mg·kg of caffeine, 3 mg·kg of p-synephrine, or the combination of these doses of caffeine and p-synephrine.  expenditure and substrate oxidation rates were measured by indirect calorimetry during a cycle ergometer ramp test from 30% to 90% of V˙O2max.In comparison with the placebo, the ingestion of caffeine, p-synephrine, or p-synephrine + caffeine did not alter total  expenditure or heart rate during the whole exercise test. However, the ingestion of caffeine (0.44 ± 0.15 g·min, P = 0.03), p-synephrine (0.43 ± 0.19 g·min, P < 0.01), and p-synephrine + caffeine (0.45 ± 0.15 g·min, P = 0.02) increased the maximal rate of fat oxidation during exercise when compared with the placebo (0.30 ± 0.12 g·min). The exercise intensity that elicited maximal fat oxidation was similar in all trials (~46.2% ± 10.2% of V˙O2max).Caffeine, p-synephrine, and p-synephrine + caffeine increased the maximal rate of fat oxidation during exercise compared with a placebo, without modifying  expenditure or heart rate.

We examined the central role of NPS for body temperature,  expenditure, locomotor activity and adrenal hormone secretion in rats. Intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of NPS increased body temperature in a dose-dependent manner.  consumption and locomotor activity were also significantly increased by icv injection of NPS. In addition, icv injection of NPS increased the peripheral blood concentration of adrenalin and corticosterone. Pretreatment with the β1- and β2-adrenergic receptor blocker timolol inhibited the NPS-induced increase of body temperature. The expression of both NPS mRNA in the brainstem and NPSR mRNA in the hypothalamus showed a nocturnal rhythm with a peak occurring during the first half of the dark period. To examine whether the endogenous NPS is involved in regulation of body temperature, NPSR antagonist SHA68 was administered one hour after darkness. SHA68 attenuated the nocturnal rise of body temperature. These results suggest that NPS contributes to the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

While enzyme-based sensing of this type of neurotransmitter has been a research interest for years, non-enzymatic approaches are gaining more attention because of their stability and low cost. Accordingly, this focused review aims to give a summary of the state of the art of non-enzymatic electrochemical sensors used for detection of neurotransmitter that lack an electrochemically active component. In place of using enzymes, transition metal materials such as those based on nickel show an acceptable level of catalytic activity for neurotransmitter sensing. They benefit from fast electron transport properties and high surface  and their catalytic activity can be much improved if their surface is modified with nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and platinum nanoparticles. However, a general comparison reveals that the performance of non-enzymatic biosensors is still lower than those that use enzyme-based methods. Nevertheless, their excellent stability demonstrates that non-enzymatic neurotransmitter sensors warrant additional research in order to advance them toward becoming an acceptable replacement for the more expensive enzyme-based sensors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29391192>Comparative study of the antioxidant properties of monocarbonyl curcumin analogues C66 and B2BrBC in isoproteranol induced cardiac damage.</a></h1><p>To test the antioxidant properties of the newly synthesized (2E,6E)-2,6-bis(2-bromobenzylidene)cyclohexanone (B2BrBC) in parallel with C66 in rats with cardiac hypertrophy.The protective effects of both C66 and B2BrBC against oxidative stress in rats with cardiac hypertrophy, was studied by evaluating the activity of antioxidant enzymes, the relationship between the ratio of the activities of the antioxidant enzymes R = SOD/(GPx + CAT) and levels of thiols and lipid peroxidation in the heart. In order to gain better understanding of the antioxidant properties of the studied compounds, computational methods were utilized. The properties of selected structurally related derivatives were obtained on optimized geometries for ground states, using semi-empirical PM3 quantum mechanical calculations.The ratio R shows disequilibrium in rats with induced hypertrophy (p < 0.001). Coextending changes were detected in total and free sulfhydryl group content (p = 0.011 for t-SH and p = 0.008, for free SH, respectively). The results with the B2BrBC, indicated strong thiol prevention reflected in the levels of both t-SH and f-SH. Taking into account the HOMO energies of B2BrBC (-9.398 eV) and C66 (-9.667), it can be concluded that B2BrBC has lower HOMO , which makes it a better electron donor and a better antioxidant.The obtained results indicated that the antioxidant ability of B2BrBC is positively associated with the catalytic SOD and GPx activities expressed through preserved t-SH levels. It seems plausible that for a compound to exhibit antioxidant activity, as most of the 2,6-bis(benzylidene)cyclohexanones do, they should be good electron donors.Understanding the relationship between cardiac hypertrophy induced oxidative injuries and supporters of endogenous reparatory machinery will help in establishing the beneficial role of adequate antioxidant supplementation. In this study reliable data on the preventive effects of newly synthesized symmetric monocarbonyl curcumin analogue B2BrBC and its role in the prevention of oxidative injuries on three levels (enzymatic, protein and lipid), in the heart hypertrophic onset, were obtained.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Adrenal medulla is one of the important organs that involves in glucose homeostasis through secretion of catecholamines. The catecholamines biosynthesis pathway utilizes various enzymes and protein kinases. The aims of this study are to investigate the effects of age on the biosynthetic pathway of catecholamines in adrenal medulla by determining the level of blood glucose and blood catecholamines, the gene and protein expression of biosynthetic catecholamine enzymes (TH, DBH and PNMT) as well as protein kinase substrates that involved in the phosphorylation of TH in 2DG-induced rats.Adrenal medulla from male Sprague Dawley rats at the age of 3-months (n=12) and 24-months (n=12) were further divided into two groups: 1) treatment group with 2DG to create glucoprivation condition and 2) the vehicle group which received normal saline as control.The results showed that the level of glucose, adrenaline and noradrenaline were increased in response to acute glucoprivation conditions in both young and old rats. No age-related differences were found in the basal gene expression of the enzymes that involved in the catecholamines biosynthesis pathway. Interestingly the expressions of TH and DBH protein as well as the level of TH phosphorylation at Ser40, PKA, PKC and ERK1/2 substrates were higher in basal condition of the aged rats. However, contradicted findings were obtained in glucoprivic condition, which the protein expressions of DBH, pERK1/2 and substrates for pPKC were increased in young rats. Only substrate for pCDK was highly expressed in the old rats in the glucoprivic condition, while pPKC and pERK1/2 were decreased significantly. The results demonstrate that adrenal medulla of young and old rats are responsive to glucose deficit and capable to restore the blood glucose level by increasing the levels of blood catecholamines.The present findings also suggest that, at least in rats, aging alters the protein expression of the biosynthetic catecholamine enzymes as well as protein kinase substrates that may attenuate the response to glucoprivation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31419122>Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effects Resolve Low-Temperature Substrate Radical Reaction Pathways and Steps in B-Dependent  Ammonia-Lyase.</a></h1><p>The first-order reaction kinetics of the cryotrapped 1,1,2,2-H-aminoethanol substrate radical intermediate state in the adenosylcobalamin (B)-dependent  ammonia-lyase (EAL) from  serovar Typhimurium are measured over the range of 203-225 K by using time-resolved, full-spectrum electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The studies target the fundamental understanding of the mechanism of EAL, the signature enzyme in  utilization metabolism associated with microbiome homeostasis and disease conditions in the human gut. Incorporation of H into the hydrogen transfer that follows the substrate radical rearrangement step in the substrate radical decay reaction sequence leads to an observed H/H isotope effect of approximately 2 that preserves, with high fidelity, the idiosyncratic piecewise pattern of rate constant versus inverse temperature dependence that was previously reported for the H-labeled substrate, including a monoexponential regime ( ≥ 220 K) and two distinct biexponential regimes ( = 203-219 K). In the global kinetic model, reaction at ≥220 K proceeds from the substrate radical macrostate, , and at 203-219 K along parallel pathways from the two sequential microstates,  and , that are distinguished by different protein configurations. Decay from , or  and , is rate-determined by radical rearrangement (H) or by contributions from both radical rearrangement and hydrogen transfer (H). Non-native direct decay to products from  is a consequence of the free  barrier to the native  →  protein configurational transition.

Recently, the gut microbiota has emerged as a potential factor in the development of MS, with a number of studies having shown that patients with MS exhibit gut dysbiosis. The gut microbiota helps the host remain healthy by regulating various functions, including food metabolism,  homeostasis, maintenance of the intestinal barrier, inhibition of colonization by pathogenic organisms, and shaping of both mucosal and systemic immune responses. Alteration of the gut microbiota, and subsequent changes in its metabolic network that perturb this homeostasis, may lead to intestinal and systemic disorders such as MS. Here we discuss the findings of recent MS microbiome studies and potential mechanisms through which gut microbiota can predispose to, or protect against, MS. These findings highlight the need of an improved understanding of the interactions between the microbiota and host for developing therapies based on gut commensals with which to treat MS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29698395>Personalizing physical exercise in a computational model of fuel homeostasis.</a></h1><p>The beneficial effects of physical activity for the prevention and management of several chronic diseases are widely recognized.

Non-affected twins discordant for schizophrenia, who developed a psychotic disorder within 5 years follow-up showed lower anandamide (P = 0.042) and 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol levels (P = 0.049) than twins who remained healthy.We suggest that the protective upregulation of endocannabinoid signalling reflects either a hereditary trait or mirrors a modulating response to genetically influenced cerebral function involving, e.g., other neurotransmitters or  metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29705701>Protective role of AgRP neuron's PDK1 against salt-induced hypertension.</a></h1><p>In the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC), orexigenic agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons regulate feeding behavior and  homeostasis. The 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) in AgRP neurons serves as a major signaling molecule for leptin and insulin, the hormones regulating feeding behavior,  homeostasis and circulation. However, it is unclear whether PDK1 in AGRP neurons is also involved in regulation of blood pressure. This study explored it by generating and analyzing AgRP neuron-specific PDK1 knockout (Agrp-Pdk1) mice and effect of high salt diet on blood pressure in KO and WT mice was analyzed. Under high salt diet feeding, systolic blood pressure (SBP) of Agrp-Pdk1 mice was significantly elevated compared to Agrp-Cre mice. When the high salt diet was switched to control low salt diet, SBP of Agrp-Pdk1 mice returned to the basal level observed in Agrp-Cre mice within 1 week. In Agrp-Pdk1 mice, urinary noradrenalin excretion and NUCB2 mRNA expression in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) were markedly upregulated. Moreover, silencing of NUCB2 in the PVN counteracted the rises in urinary noradrenalin excretions and SBP. These results demonstrate a novel role of PDK1 in AgRP neurons to counteract the high salt diet-induced hypertension by preventing hyperactivation of PVN nesfatin-1 neurons.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Vitamins B6, B8, and B12 have been shown not only to reduce psychiatric symptoms but also shorten the duration of illness. Vitamin B9, also known as folate or folic acid, has also been associated with psychiatric symptoms. However, when patients lack a specific genetic enzyme, which converts folate/folic acid to its most usable form, L-methylfolate, the neuroprotective and neuropsychiatric benefits are lost. L-methylfolate allows for the synthesis of the three major neurochemicals-serotonin, nor-epinephrine, and dopamine-across the blood-brain barrier.

Among the various treatments, the NDMA (sausage-free) group demonstrated the most remarkable changes. Phenylalanine was decreased followed by an increase, and tyrosine persistently declined, both of which were elevated in the NDMA group. In addition, the histopathological result was consistent with that of the serum metabolomic analysis, and the changes in serum metabolites in each sausage diet group and the NDMA group were consistently associated with disorders of lipids, amino acid, and  metabolism.This work indicates that excessive NDMA content in sausage may cause liver damage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28262321>Exploration of potential biomarkers and related biological pathways for PCB exposure in maternal and cord serum: A pilot birth cohort study in Chiba, Japan.</a></h1><p>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been associated with adverse human reproductive and fetal developmental measures or outcomes because of their endocrine-disrupting effects; however, the biological mechanisms of adverse effects of PCB exposure in humans are not currently well established. In this study, we aimed to identify the biological pathways and potential biomarkers of PCB exposure in maternal and umbilical cord serum using a hydrophilic interaction chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS) metabolomics platform. The median concentration of total PCBs in maternal (n=93) and cord serum (n=93) were 350 and 70pgg wet wt, respectively. PCB levels in maternal and fetal serum from the Chiba Study of Mother and Children's Health (C-MACH) cohort are comparable to those of earlier cohort studies conducted in Japan, the USA, and European countries. We used the random forest model with the metabolome profile to predict exposure levels of PCB (first quartile [Q1] and fourth quartile [Q4]) for pregnant women and fetuses. In the prediction model for classification of Q1 versus Q4 (area-under-curve [AUC]: pregnant women=0.812 and fetuses=0.919), citraconic acid level in maternal serum and , p-hydroxybenzoate, and purine levels in cord serum had >0.70 AUC values. These candidate biomarkers and metabolite included in composited models were related to glutathione and amino acid metabolism in maternal serum and the amino acid metabolism and ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis in cord serum (FDR <0.10), indicating disruption of metabolic pathways by PCB exposure in pregnant women and fetuses. These results showed that metabolome analysis might be useful to explore potential biomarkers and related biological pathways for PCB exposure. Thus, more detailed studies are needed to verify sensitivity of the biomarkers and clarify the biochemical changes resulting from PCB exposure.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

However, so far, occurrence data in the environment are lacking. Within this study NEB has been found for the first time in effluent samples of wastewater treatment plants in Germany with an average concentration of 13 ng L. Its photodegradation behavior in the environment and in technical processes is largely unknown. To fill this gap, three different UV treatment procedures (UV-C at 254 nm, UV-B at 312 nm and UV-A at 365 nm) were investigated in three different matrices: pure water, pure water in presence of the hydroxyl radical (OH) scavenger tert.-butanol and real wastewater. No elimination was observed during UV-A treatment. In contrast, NEB degradation during UV-B and UV-C treatment followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics, with highest removal rate during UV-C treatment in pure water (k = 7.8 × 10 s). The rate constant for UV-C irradiation decreased to 2.9 × 10 s in the presence of the OH scavenger and in the presence of the wastewater matrix. The rate constant for the UV-B lamp was 4.4 × 10 s, Three transformation products were identified after UV-B and UV-C photolytic degradation using high resolution mass spectrometry. The main photoreaction is the substitution of the fluorine atoms of NEB by hydroxyl groups. A photolytic cleavage of the CF bond can be excluded as the high bond dissociation  of aromatic CF bonds (525 kJ mol), exceeds the  of electromagnetic radiation applied in the present study (≥254 nm, i.e., max. 471 kJ E). The quantum yields for NEB degradation for the UV-C lamp achieved in pure water, the OH scavenged system and wastewater matrix were Φ = 0.53, 0.19 and 0.22, respectively. For UV-B Φ was 0.023 ± 0.003, noticeable differences in quantum yield were not found. The photooxidation involves reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and singlet oxygen. These oxidative species may be formed upon reaction of photo-excited NEB with oxygen.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Achieving consistency across these scenarios has presented a significant challenge, especially for combination products that contain more than one drug. This study characterized the delivered dose and aerosol properties of glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate metered dose inhaler (GFF MDI; Bevespi Aerosphere™). GFF MDI, a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, glycopyrrolate (18 μg, equivalent to glycopyrronium 14.4 μg), and a long-acting β-agonist, formoterol fumarate (9.6 μg; equivalent to formoterol fumarate dihydrate 10 μg), is formulated using innovative co-suspension delivery technology, which suspends micronized drug crystals with spray-dried phospholipid porous particles in hydrofluoroalkane propellant. In this study, delivered dose uniformity was assessed through the labeled number of doses, and aerosol properties, such as percent fine particle fraction (FPF) and mass median aerodynamic diameter, were determined by cascade impaction. GFF MDI achieved reproducible dose delivery and an FPF greater than 55%, whether formulated and delivered as a monocomponent or dual FDC. The performance of GFF MDI was maintained across various manufacturing batches, under extended storage, and with variations in flow rate. Furthermore, unlike a GFF drug crystal-only suspension, drug delivery remained consistent for GFF MDI when simulated patient-handling errors were applied, such as reduced shake  and delays between shaking and actuation. These results demonstrate that co-suspension delivery technology overcomes well-known sources of variability in MDI drug delivery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31252195>EXCITATION study: Unexplained in-custody deaths: Evaluating biomarkers of stress and agitation.</a></h1><p>Law enforcement personnel often confront violent and dangerous individuals suffering from Excited Delirium Syndrome (ExDS) who need emergent medical evaluation and treatment to optimize the best outcomes for this potentially lethal medical emergency. These subjects typically require physical restraint and use of force measures to control them. We sought to determine if stress-related biomarkers can differentiate ExDS subjects when compared with agitation and stress under other circumstances, including agitation and extreme physical exhaustion and restraint coupled with emotional stressors.This was a prospective multi-center study enrolling a convenience sample of patients who presented with agitation or ExDS. Patients were enrolled from three academic emergency departments (ED), two in the United States and one in Canada. Three study groups (SG) included: SG1) patients brought to the ED with ExDS based on the use of standardized clinical criteria; SG2) ED patients with acute agitation who were not in a clinical state of ExDS but required sedation; SG3) a laboratory control group of subjects exercised to physical exhaustion, restrained, and psychologically stressed with threat of Conducted  Device (CED) activation. We examined a panel of stress-related biomarkers, including norepinephrine (NE), cortisol, copeptin, orexin A, and dynorphin (Dyn) from the blood of enrolled subjects.A total of 82 subjects were enrolled: 31 in the agitation group, 21 in the ExDS group, and 30 in the laboratory control group. Data were analyzed, comparing the findings between ExDS and the two other groups to determine if specific stress-related biomarkers are associated with ExDS. Biomarker comparisons between subjects identified with ExDS, agitation, and control groups demonstrated that cortisol levels were more elevated in the ExDS group compared with the other groups. Orexin was only significant in ExDs (with Agitated tendency but lot of variability in the group). NE and Dyn increased as response to stress in Agitated and ExDS.Cortisol levels were more elevated in subjects in the ExDS group compared with the other comparison groups and orexin was elevated in ExDS compared to controls, a trend that did not reach statistical significance in the agitated group. The clinical or diagnostic significance of these difference have yet to be defined and warrants further study.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

A trade-off between the absorption capacity and phase separation ratio is critical for developing an advanced biphasic solvent. Typically, water content in the biphasic solvent can be manipulated to tune the phase separation behavior. To explore the relationship between water content and phase separation behavior, an inert organic solvent, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, was added as a substitute for water in a biphasic solvent, specifically a triethylenetetramine (TETA) and 2-(diethylamino)ethanol (DEEA) blend. Moreover, the water content-kinetics and thermodynamics relationships were also evaluated. Experimental results revealed that reducing the water content was beneficial for phase separation but adverse for adsorption capacity. Kinetic analysis indicated that the water content did not significantly affect the rate of CO absorption at a rich loading. Furthermore, the regeneration heat decreased with the water content. The regeneration heat of TETA-DEEA with a water content of 20 wt % was almost 50% less than that of MEA solution. C nuclear magnetic resonance analysis revealed that the water content did not affect the reaction mechanism between CO and amines.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29777633>Hypertrophic effect of inhaled beta -agonist with and without concurrent exercise training: A randomized controlled trial.</a></h1><p>Due to a high prevalence of asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in elite athletes, there is a high use of beta -adrenoceptor agonists (beta -agonists) in the athletic population. While anabolic in rodents, no study has been able to detect hypertrophy in humans after chronic beta -agonist inhalation. We investigated whether inhaled beta -agonist, terbutaline, alters body composition and metabolic rate with and without concurrent exercise training in healthy young men. Sixty-seven participants completed a 4-week intervention of daily terbutaline (8 × 0.5 mg) or placebo treatment without concurrent training (habitual; n = 23), with resistance (n = 23) or endurance (n = 21) training 3 times weekly. Before and after the interventions, participant's body composition was determined by dual- X-ray absorptiometry and resting metabolic rate and substrate oxidation by indirect calorimetry. Terbutaline increased lean body mass by 1.03 kg (95% CI 0.29-1.76; P < .05) and 1.04 kg (95% CI 0.16-1.93; P < .05) compared to placebo in the habitual and resistance training group, respectively, but had no effect compared to placebo in the endurance training group [-0.56 kg (95% CI -1.74-0.62; P > .05)]. Fat mass, bone mineral content, and resting metabolic rate did not change differently between treatments with the intervention. Daily inhalation of terbutaline in near-therapeutic doses induces skeletal muscle growth. This observation should be a concern for antidoping authorities.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

This diet induces a type 2 diabetes/metabolic syndrome phenotype with hypertension. In diabetic meriones, body weight increase was associated with hyperglycemia, increased insulinemia, and insulin resistance. Compared to lean meriones, diabetic meriones showed decreased aorta contraction to noradrenaline, which was normalized after NOS inhibition. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to carbachol was enhanced, while relaxing effects of the NO donor SNAP and of diazoxide were unchanged. Insulin-evoked relaxation was depressed in aorta from diabetic meriones, and L-arginine relaxed contracted arteries from diabetic meriones, but not from lean meriones. Urine NOX level and iNOS mRNA muscle expression were significantly higher in diabetic meriones compared to lean animals. These data strongly suggest that iNOS may have a pathogenic role in vascular dysfunction observed in diet-induced diabetic meriones.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29460446>Effect of sotalol on heart rate, QT interval, and atrial fibrillation cycle length in horses with atrial fibrillation.</a></h1><p>Based on its pharmacokinetic profile and electrophysiological effects in healthy horses, sotalol potentially could be used as a long-term PO antiarrhythmic drug in horses.To evaluate the effect of sotalol on heart rate (HR), QT interval, atrial fibrillatory rate, and success of cardioversion in horses with naturally occurring chronic atrial fibrillation (AF).Twenty-eight horses referred for transvenous electrical cardioversion of AF were treated with 2 mg/kg sotalol PO q12h for 3 days before cardioversion, and 13 horses underwent the same protocol without sotalol administration.Retrospective study. Before and after sotalol or no treatment, the HR was measured at rest and during an exercise test. The QT interval and atrial fibrillation cycle length (AFCL) were measured at rest using tissue Doppler velocity imaging.In the control group, no significant differences were found between the 2 examinations. In the sotalol group, the HR at rest and during exercise was significantly lower after sotalol treatment, whereas the QT interval and AFCL measured by tissue Doppler increased significantly. Cardioversion to sinus rhythm was achieved in 25/28 horses in the sotalol group and all horses in the control group, but the median number of shocks and  at cardioversion were significantly lower in the sotalol group.In horses with AF, sotalol administration results in class III antiarrhythmic effects and β-blocking activity, with moderate HR reduction during exercise.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Here, we assessed whether the catecholamine noradrenalin directly modulates the activity of these neurons in mice. Perforated patch clamp recordings showed that noradrenalin changes the activity of these functionally antagonistic neurons in opposite ways, increasing the activity of the orexigenic NPY/AgRP neurons and decreasing the activity of the anorexigenic POMC neurons. Cell type-specific transcriptomics and pharmacological experiments revealed that the opposing effect on these neurons is mediated by the activation of excitatory α - and β- adrenergic receptors in NPY/AgRP neurons, while POMC neurons are inhibited via α - adrenergic receptors. Thus, the coordinated differential modulation of the key hypothalamic neurons in control of  homeostasis assigns noradrenalin an important role to promote feeding.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28201733>Low STAT3 expression sensitizes to toxic effects of β-adrenergic receptor stimulation in peripartum cardiomyopathy.</a></h1><p>The benefit of the β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR) agonist dobutamine for treatment of acute heart failure in peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is controversial. Cardiac STAT3 expression is reduced in PPCM patients. Mice carrying a cardiomyocyte-restricted deletion of STAT3 (CKO) develop PPCM. We hypothesized that STAT3-dependent signalling networks may influence the response to β-AR agonist treatment in PPCM patients and analysed this hypothesis in CKO mice.Follow-up analyses in 27 patients with severe PPCM (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤25%) revealed that 19 of 20 patients not obtaining dobutamine improved cardiac function. All seven patients obtaining dobutamine received heart transplantation (n = 4) or left ventricular assist devices (n = 3). They displayed diminished myocardial triglyceride, pyruvate, and lactate content compared with non-failing controls. The β-AR agonist isoproterenol (Iso) induced heart failure with high mortality in postpartum female, in non-pregnant female and in male CKO, but not in wild-type mice. Iso induced heart failure and high mortality in CKO mice by impairing fatty acid and glucose uptake, thereby generating a metabolic deficit. The latter was governed by disturbed STAT3-dependent signalling networks, microRNA-199a-5p, microRNA-7a-5p, insulin/glucose transporter-4, and neuregulin/ErbB signalling. The resulting cardiac  depletion and oxidative stress promoted dysfunction and cardiomyocyte loss inducing irreversible heart failure, which could be attenuated by the β1-AR blocker metoprolol or glucose-uptake-promoting drugs perhexiline and etomoxir.Iso impairs glucose uptake, induces  depletion, oxidative stress, dysfunction, and death in STAT3-deficient cardiomyocytes mainly via β1-AR stimulation. These cellular alterations may underlie the dobutamine-induced irreversible heart failure progression in PPCM patients who frequently display reduced cardiac STAT3 expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28741686>GPR55 receptor antagonist decreases glycolytic activity in PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cell line and tumor xenografts.</a></h1><p>The Warburg effect is a predominant metabolic pathway in cancer cells characterized by enhanced glucose uptake and its conversion to l-lactate and is associated with upregulated expression of HIF-1α and activation of the EGFR-MEK-ERK, Wnt-β-catenin, and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. (R,R')-4'-methoxy-1-naphthylfenoterol ((R,R')-MNF) significantly reduces proliferation, survival, and motility of PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells through inhibition of the GPR55 receptor. We examined (R,R')-MNF's effect on glycolysis in PANC-1 cells and tumors. Global NMR metabolomics was used to elucidate differences in the metabolome between untreated and (R,R')-MNF-treated cells. LC/MS analysis was used to quantify intracellular concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate, carnitine, and l-lactate. Changes in target protein expression were determined by Western blot analysis. Data was also obtained from mouse PANC-1 tumor xenografts after administration of (R,R')-MNF. Metabolomics data indicate that (R,R')-MNF altered fatty acid metabolism,  metabolism, and amino acid metabolism and increased intracellular concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate and carnitine while reducing l-lactate content. The cellular content of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and hexokinase 2 was reduced consistent with diminished PI3K-AKT signaling and glucose metabolism. The presence of the GLUT8 transporter was established and found to be attenuated by (R,R')-MNF. Mice treated with (R,R')-MNF had significant accumulation of l-lactate in tumor tissue relative to vehicle-treated mice, together with reduced levels of the selective l-lactate transporter MCT4. Lower intratumoral levels of EGFR, pyruvate kinase M2, β-catenin, hexokinase 2, and p-glycoprotein were also observed. The data suggest that (R,R')-MNF reduces glycolysis in PANC-1 cells and tumors through reduced expression and function at multiple controlling sites in the glycolytic pathway.© 2017 UICC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29511334>Psychostimulant drug effects on glutamate, Glx, and creatine in the anterior cingulate cortex and subjective response in healthy humans.</a></h1><p>Prescription psychostimulants produce rapid changes in mood, , and attention. These drugs are widely used and abused. However, their effects in human neocortex on glutamate and glutamine (pooled as Glx), and key neurometabolites such as N-acetylaspartate (tNAA), creatine (tCr), choline (Cho), and myo-inositol (Ins) are poorly understood. Changes in these compounds could inform the mechanism of action of psychostimulant drugs and their abuse potential in humans. We investigated the acute impact of two FDA-approved psychostimulant drugs on neurometabolites using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H MRS). Single clinically relevant doses of d-amphetamine (AMP, 20 mg oral), methamphetamine (MA, 20 mg oral; Desoxyn®), or placebo were administered to healthy participants (n = 26) on three separate test days in a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, within-subjects crossover design. Each participant experienced all three conditions and thus served as his/her own control. H MRS was conducted in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), an integrative neocortical hub, during the peak period of drug responses (140-150 m post ingestion). D-amphetamine increased the level of Glu (p = .0001), Glx (p = .003), and tCr (p = .0067) in the dACC. Methamphetamine increased Glu in females, producing a significant crossover interaction pattern with gender (p = .02). Drug effects on Glu, tCr, and Glx were positively correlated with subjective drug responses, predicting both the duration of AMP liking (Glu: r = +.49, p = .02; tCr: r = +.41, p = .047) and the magnitude of peak drug high to MA (Glu: r = +.52, p = .016; Glx: r = +.42, p = .049). Neither drug affected the levels of tNAA, Cho, or Ins after correction for multiple comparisons. We conclude that d-amphetamine increased the concentration of glutamate, Glx, and tCr in the dACC in male and female volunteers 2/ hours after drug consumption. There was evidence that methamphetamine differentially affects dACC Glu levels in women and men. These findings provide the first experimental evidence that specific psychostimulants increase the level of glutamatergic compounds in the human brain, and that glutamatergic changes predict the extent and magnitude of subjective responses to psychostimulants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28425435>FRET biosensor uncovers cAMP nano-domains at β-adrenergic targets that dictate precise tuning of cardiac contractility.</a></h1><p>Compartmentalized cAMP/PKA signalling is now recognized as important for physiology and pathophysiology, yet a detailed understanding of the properties, regulation and function of local cAMP/PKA signals is lacking. Here we present a fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET)-based sensor, CUTie, which detects compartmentalized cAMP with unprecedented accuracy. CUTie, targeted to specific multiprotein complexes at discrete plasmalemmal, sarcoplasmic reticular and myofilament sites, reveals differential kinetics and amplitudes of localized cAMP signals. This nanoscopic heterogeneity of cAMP signals is necessary to optimize cardiac contractility upon adrenergic activation. At low adrenergic levels, and those mimicking heart failure, differential local cAMP responses are exacerbated, with near abolition of cAMP signalling at certain locations. This work provides tools and fundamental mechanistic insights into subcellular adrenergic signalling in normal and pathological cardiac function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30682691>Can photolysis of the CoC bond in coenzyme B-dependent enzymes be used to mimic the native reaction?</a></h1><p>Coenzyme B (Adenosylcobalamin = AdoCbl)-dependent enzymes catalyze complex molecular transformations where cleavage of the CoC bond initiates the catalytic cycle. Alternatively, the CoC bond can be cleaved with light. In both cases, rupture of the CoC bond results in the formation of Co(II)/Ado radical pair (RP). Within the field of B chemistry, there has been a suspicion that photolytic cleavage can be used as a probe or a direct comparison of the native reaction. Herein, we seek to resolve what the connection between light induced RP formation and the native catalytic cycle is. We used a combined QM/MM approach to construct PESs for AdoCbl-dependent  ammonia-lyase (EAL) as a function of axial bonds to describe the reaction mechanism. We have found that there is no direct comparison that can be made between photolysis and enzymatic cleavage as the mechanism associated with these involves different electronic states. With that being said, we have explored an alternate hypothesis for the connection which involves the one-electron reduced form of the AdoCbl cofactor. This hypothesis is in line with the concept based on proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET), which involves the formation of AdoCbl cofactor-tyrosine diradical complex. The topology of the PES for the one-electron reduced (D) cofactor is very similar to the PES associated with photo-induced cleavage (S). Both surfaces contain two  minima that are, similarly, the result of two distinct electronic states. Thus, it appears that the reaction mechanism associated with the D surface and the S surface are very similar, providing a plausible connection between photolysis and native catalysis.Copyright © 2018.

It is observed that the fluorescein (FAM)-labeled single-stranded DNA (FAM-DNA) is absorbed on the surface of GO if SP is absent. This causes that fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET) from PFP to FAM is inefficient when adding PFP into FAM-DNA/GO complex. If SP is added to FAM-DNA/GO complex, FAM-DNA is desorbed from GO surface due to the competitive binding of SP and FAM-DNA toward GO. In this case, FAM-DNA is close to PFP in the presence of PFP through strong electrostatic interaction, leading to the occurrence of efficient FRET. Based on the above phenomenon, we demonstrate a method to amplify fluorescence signal of traditional GO-based SP assay by introducing PFP. In comparison to the use of single GO, the combination of PFP with GO-based strategy displays high turn-on ratio and enhanced sensitivity with a limit of detection as low as 7.3 ng mL for SP detection. Satisfactory results in practical samples are also obtained by the recovery experiments, demonstrating the potential application of cationic conjugated polymer in plant-derived small molecule.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that consumption of a specific combination of amino acids (arginine, alanine, and phenylalanine; A-mix) may be involved in secretion of glucagon, and when combined with exercise may promote fat catabolism. Ten healthy male volunteers were randomized in a crossover study to ingest either A-mix (3 g/dose) or placebo (3 g of dextrin/dose). Thirty minutes after ingesting, each condition subsequently performed workload trials on a cycle ergometer at 50% of maximal oxygen consumption for 1 h. After oral intake of A-mix, the concentrations of plasma ketone bodies and adrenalin during and post-exercise were significantly increased. The area under the curve for glycerol and glucagon was significantly increased in the post-exercise by A-mix administration.

We previously reported positive associations between plasma free choline and bone mineral density (BMD). Animal studies suggest an impact of dietary choline on bone metabolism, but the role of dietary intake of choline and betaine for human bone health is unknown. The main aims were to examine the associations of dietary choline, choline species, and betaine with BMD and to study the relations between dietary and plasma free choline and betaine. Study subjects were participants in the Hordaland Health Study, including 2649 women and 1983 men (aged 46-49 or 71-74 y). BMD was measured by dual- X-ray absorptiometry, and dietary intake was obtained by using a validated 169-item food-frequency questionnaire. Risk associations were assessed by logistic regression and correlations by ρ (Spearman's bivariate rank order correlation). Subjects in the lowest compared with the highest tertile of dietary total choline, free choline, glycerophosphocholine, phosphocholine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin had a higher risk of low-femoral neck BMD, defined as the lowest BMD quintile. Particularly strong associations were found among middle-aged men for intake of free choline (OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.24, 2.69;  = 0.002) and glycerophosphocholine (OR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.43, 3.16;  < 0.001) and among elderly women for total choline (OR: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.33, 2.88;  = 0.001) and phosphatidylcholine (OR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.33, 2.84:  = 0.001) intake. No significant associations were observed between dietary betaine and BMD. Dietary total choline, free choline, glycerophosphocholine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin correlated weakly with plasma free choline (ρ: 0.07, 0.05, 0.07, 0.07, and 0.05, respectively;  < 0.01). Dietary betaine correlated with plasma betaine (ρ: 0.23;  < 0.001).

Recently, a new class of sustainable solvents named deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have been developed, which share the promising solvent characteristics of ILs, such as thermal and chemical stability, low vapor pressure and design ability. In addition, the major advantages of DESs over ILs are their lower prices and easier preparation. Therefore, DESs have been considered to be a potential alternative to replace conventional organic solvents and ILs. Currently, the developed DESs may be classified into ionic and nonionic liquids. Typically, choline chloride (ChCl)/urea (1:2) is an ionic DES, while glucose/sucrose (1:1) is a nonionic DES. Although several reviews have covered advancements in DESs, in this review, we aim to provide a general insight into DESs, particularly ionic DESs, like choline-based DES, in terms of their preparation and application in the extraction of natural products (NPs) mainly from traditional Chinese medicines and the recovery of extracted compounds from their extracts. Additionally, various factors affecting the extraction efficiency of DESs are discussed.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we investigated the effects of local injection of ACh on fMRI and neural signals in the primary visual cortex (V1) of anesthetized macaques by combining pharmaco-based MRI (phMRI) with electrophysiological recordings, using single electrodes and electrode arrays. We found that local injection of ACh elicited two distinct profiles of fMRI and neurophysiological activity, depending on the distance from the injector. Near the injection site, we observed an increase in the baseline blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses, while their visual modulation decreased. In contrast, further from the injection site, we observed an increase in the visually induced BOLD and CBF modulation without changes in baseline. Neurophysiological recordings suggest that the spatial correspondence between fMRI responses and neural activity does not change in the gamma, high-gamma, and multiunit activity (MUA) bands. The results near the injection site suggest increased inhibitory drive and decreased metabolism, contrasting to the far region. These changes are thought to reflect the kinetics of ACh and its metabolism to choline.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

The development of a stable and diverse gut microbiota is essential to various host physiologic functions such as immunoregulation, pathogen prevention,  harvest, and metabolism. At the same time, a dysbiotic gut microbiota associated with disease is altered in structure and function, and often characterized by a decrease in species richness and proliferation of pathogenic bacterial taxa. As a shared substrate between the host and the gut microbiota, diet significantly impacts the health and disease states of the host both directly and through gut microbial metabolite production. This is demonstrated in the examples of short-chain fatty acid and trimethylamine production via bacterial metabolism of dietary complex carbohydrates and choline, respectively. In disorders related to mucosal immune dysregulation such as inflammatory bowel disease, the dysbiotic gut microbiota and diet contribute to its pathogenesis. Reversal of dysbiosis through fecal microbiota transplantation and dietary interventions may thus represent important strategies to modify the gut microbiota and its metabolite production for health maintenance as well as disease prevention and management.© 2017 Nestec Ltd., Vevey/S.

If this finding extends to the response to a meal, it could have important implications for the role of the sympathetic nervous system in  balance and weight gain. We hypothesized high muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) would be associated with a low sympathetically mediated component of  expenditure following a meal. Fourteen young, healthy adults completed two visits randomized to continuous saline (control) or intravenous propranolol to achieve systemic -adrenergic blockade. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity and REE were measured (indirect calorimetry) followed by a liquid mixed meal (Ensure). Measures of  expenditure continued every 30 min for 5 h after the meal and are reported as an area under the curve (AUC). Sympathetic support of  expenditure was calculated as the difference between the AUC during saline and -blockade (AUC-AUC, -REE) and as a percent (%) of control (AUC÷AUC × 100). -REE was associated with baseline sympathetic activity, such that individuals with high resting MSNA (bursts/100 heart beats) and plasma NE had the greatest sympathetically mediated component of  expenditure following a meal (MSNA: -REE =-0.58,  0.03; %REE  = -0.56, 0.04; NE: -REE = -0.55,  = 0.0535; %REE  = -0.54,  = 0.0552). Contrary to our hypothesis, high resting sympathetic activity is associated with a greater sympathetically mediated component of  expenditure following a liquid meal. These findings may have implications for weight maintenance in individuals with varying resting sympathetic activity.© 2017 The Authors.

We hypothesized that neuromuscular, immune and stress indicators will be higher after  demanding sprint interval exercise (SIE) than to mechanically demanding stretch-shortening cycle exercise (SSE). The main aim of this study was to assess and compare the kinetics of blood brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), norepinephrine (NE) and cortisol (as stress indicators) and proinflammatory (IL-6) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines within 24 hours after metabolically demanding SIE and after muscle damage inducing SSE. Twenty healthy physically active young men randomly assigned to two equal groups to complete 12 bouts of 5 s stationary cycling sprints every 3 min (SIE) or 200 drop-jumps with 30 s interval between each jump (SSE), respectively. Quadriceps muscle maximal voluntary contraction torque and voluntary activation and soreness were measured and blood samples collected before and 2 min, 1 hour, 12 hours and 24 hours after the SIE and SSE. The BDNF, cortisol, IL-6 and NE levels increased more at 2 min after SIE than SSE (P < 0.05); however, the IL-10 level did not differ between SIE and SSE. BDNF and cortisol levels were decreased at 24 h after both SIE and especially after SSE. The higher was the initial BDNF level, the greater was its decrease at 24 h after both type of exercise. Before exercise BDNF level correlated closely with the change in central fatigue (decrease in voluntary activation) after both SIE and SSE. We thus conclude that both metabolically demanding SIE and muscle damage inflicting SSE induced long-lasting decrease in circulating BDNF which may not promote brain health. The level of circulating BDNF, but not cortisol, IL-6, IL-10 or NE, was associated with changes in central motor fatigue.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28763749>Protective effects of ethanolic peel and pulp extracts of Citrus macroptera fruit against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats.</a></h1><p>Increases in the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) have aroused strong interest in identifying antioxidants from natural sources for use in preventive medicine. Citrus macroptera (C. macroptera), commonly known as "Satkara", is an important herbal and medicinal plant reputed for its antioxidant, nutritious and therapeutic uses. The aim of the present study was to investigate the cardio-protective effects of ethanol extracts of C. macroptera peel and pulp against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in rats. Male albino Wistar rats (n=36) were pre-treated with peel and pulp extracts (500mg/kg) for 45days. They received a challenge with ISO (85mg/kg) on the 44th and 45th days. Our findings indicated that subcutaneous injection of ISO induced severe myocardial injuries associated with oxidative stress, as confirmed by elevated lipid peroxidation (LPO) and decreased cellular reduced glutathione (GSH) and anti-peroxidative enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione-S-transferase, compared with levels observed in control animals. Pre-treatment with C. macroptera peel and pulp extracts prior to ISO administration however, significantly improved many of the investigated biochemical parameters, i.e., cardiac troponin I, cardiac marker enzymes, lipid profile and oxidative stress markers. The fruit peel extract showed stronger cardio-protective effects than the pulp extract. The biochemical findings were further confirmed by histopathological examinations. Overall, the increased endogenous antioxidant enzyme activity against heightened oxidative stress in the myocardium is strongly suggestive of the cardio-protective potential of C. macroptera.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The phase-splitting phenomenon was observed after the CO loading level had exceeded 0.73 mol CO/L, thereby generating a CO-rich MEA upper layer and a lower layer containing sulfolane. Sulfolane facilitated CO absorption because of its strong affinity with acid gases, which resulted in an absorption rate 2.7 times higher than that of the conventional MEA process. The process simulation using Aspen Plus indicated that the regeneration heat with the MEA/sulfolane mixture as a solvent substantially decreased to 2.67 GJ/t-CO, which was 31% lower than that of the conventional MEA process (3.85 GJ/t-CO). Moreover, the sensible heat and vaporization heat of MEA/sulfolane were markedly decreased by 62.4% and 47.9%, which could be ascribed to the decreased stripping volume and relatively high CO partial pressure caused by liquid-liquid phase separation. The proposed system is proved to be a promising candidate for the advancement of CO capture techniques with high CO absorption capacity, rapid absorption rate, and low- penalty.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30715867>Rheological Behavior of Environmentally Friendly Viscoelastic Solutions Formed by a Rosin-Based Anionic Surfactant.</a></h1><p>It is of great significance to explore novel applications of renewable resources. In this study, a rosin-based anionic surfactant (abbreviated R-11-2-Na), which contains a large hydrophobic group of 30 carbon atoms, was synthesized. R-11-2-Na forms wormlike micelles in the presence of the equimolar organic salt choline chloride, endowing solutions with strong viscoelasticity. The wormlike micellar solutions were investigated using rheology, small-angle X-ray scattering, and freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy (FF-TEM) methods at 25 °C. Due to the strong van der Waals interactions caused by the large hydrophobic group contained in R-11-2-Na, the zero-shear viscosity (η) of solutions showed extremely strong dependence on the concentration with an exponent of 23.4. The cross-sectional diameter of the wormlike micelles in the present system was significantly larger than that of the wormlike micelles formed by surfactants containing conventional alkyl tails. This finding may be attributed to the steric hindrance brought by the bulky and rigid dehydroabietic acid unit in the hydrophobic part. The wormlike micelles also showed high tolerance to the organic salt concentration. The present study reveals the notable qualities of rosin-based derivatives in forming complex fluids and facilitates new utilizations of forest resources.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31246477>Interfacial Aromatics Mediating Cation-π Interactions with Choline-Containing Lipids Can Contribute as Much to Peripheral Protein Affinity for Membranes as Aromatics Inserted below the Phosphates.</a></h1><p>Membrane-binding interfaces of peripheral proteins are restricted to a small part of their exposed surface, so the ability to engage in strong selective interactions with membrane lipids at various depths in the interface, both below and above the phosphates, is an advantage. Driven by their hydrophobicity, aromatic amino acids preferentially partition into membrane interfaces, often below the phosphates, yet enthalpically favorable interactions with the lipid headgroups, above the phosphate plane, are likely to further stabilize high interfacial positions. Using free- perturbation, we calculate the energetic cost of alanine substitution for 11 interfacial aromatic amino acids from 3 peripheral proteins. We show that the involvement in cation-π interactions with the headgroups (i) increases the ΔΔ as compared with insertion at the same depth without cation-π stabilization and (ii) can contribute at least as much as deeper insertion below the phosphates, highlighting the multiple roles of aromatics in peripheral membrane protein affinity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29880645>Choline transport links macrophage phospholipid metabolism and inflammation.</a></h1><p>Choline is an essential nutrient that is required for synthesis of the main eukaryote phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine. Macrophages are innate immune cells that survey and respond to danger and damage signals. Although it is well-known that  metabolism can dictate macrophage function, little is known as to the importance of choline homeostasis in macrophage biology. We hypothesized that the uptake and metabolism of choline are important for macrophage inflammation. Polarization of primary bone marrow macrophages with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in an increased rate of choline uptake and higher levels of PC synthesis. This was attributed to a substantial increase in the transcript and protein expression of the choline transporter-like protein-1 (CTL1) in polarized cells. We next sought to determine the importance of choline uptake and CTL1 for macrophage immune responsiveness. Chronic pharmacological or CTL1 antibody-mediated inhibition of choline uptake resulted in altered cytokine secretion in response to LPS, which was associated with increased levels of diacylglycerol and activation of protein kinase C. These experiments establish a previously unappreciated link between choline phospholipid metabolism and macrophage immune responsiveness, highlighting a critical and regulatory role for macrophage choline uptake via the CTL1 transporter.© 2018 Snider et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28953873>Inflammasome-driven catecholamine catabolism in macrophages blunts lipolysis during ageing.</a></h1><p>Catecholamine-induced lipolysis, the first step in the generation of  substrates by the hydrolysis of triglycerides, declines with age. The defect in the mobilization of free fatty acids in the elderly is accompanied by increased visceral adiposity, lower exercise capacity, failure to maintain core body temperature during cold stress, and reduced ability to survive starvation. Although catecholamine signalling in adipocytes is normal in the elderly, how lipolysis is impaired in ageing remains unknown. Here we show that adipose tissue macrophages regulate the age-related reduction in adipocyte lipolysis in mice by lowering the bioavailability of noradrenaline. Unexpectedly, unbiased whole-transcriptome analyses of adipose macrophages revealed that ageing upregulates genes that control catecholamine degradation in an NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent manner. Deletion of NLRP3 in ageing restored catecholamine-induced lipolysis by downregulating growth differentiation factor-3 (GDF3) and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) that is known to degrade noradrenaline. Consistent with this, deletion of GDF3 in inflammasome-activated macrophages improved lipolysis by decreasing levels of MAOA and caspase-1. Furthermore, inhibition of MAOA reversed the age-related reduction in noradrenaline concentration in adipose tissue, and restored lipolysis with increased levels of the key lipolytic enzymes adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). Our study reveals that targeting neuro-immunometabolic signalling between the sympathetic nervous system and macrophages may offer new approaches to mitigate chronic inflammation-induced metabolic impairment and functional decline.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29475899>The Phosphate Fast-Responsive Genes  and  Affect Phosphocholine and Phosphoethanolamine Content.</a></h1><p>Phosphate starvation-mediated induction of the HAD-type phosphatases PPsPase1 (AT1G73010) and PECP1 (AT1G17710) has been reported in Arabidopsis (). However, little is known about their in vivo function or impact on plant responses to nutrient deficiency. The preferences of PPsPase1 and PECP1 for different substrates have been studied in vitro but require confirmation in planta. Here, we examined the in vivo function of both enzymes using a reverse genetics approach. We demonstrated that PPsPase1 and PECP1 affect plant phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine content, but not the pyrophosphate-related phenotypes. These observations suggest that the enzymes play a similar role in planta related to the recycling of polar heads from membrane lipids that is triggered during phosphate starvation. Altering the expression of the genes encoding these enzymes had no effect on lipid composition, possibly due to compensation by other lipid recycling pathways triggered during phosphate starvation. Furthermore, our results indicated that PPsPase1 and PECP1 do not influence phosphate homeostasis, since the inactivation of these genes had no effect on phosphate content or on the induction of molecular markers related to phosphate starvation. A combination of transcriptomics and imaging analyses revealed that PPsPase1 and PECP1 display a highly dynamic expression pattern that closely mirrors the phosphate status. This temporal dynamism, combined with the wide range of induction levels, broad expression, and lack of a direct effect on Pi content and regulation, makes PPsPase1 and PECP1 useful molecular markers of the phosphate starvation response.© 2018 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The Key Role of Transmembrane Domain 6 in Human Serotonin and Norepinephrine Transporters Revealed by Molecular Dynamics Simulation.</a></h1><p>Dual inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (hSERT and hNET) gives greatly improved efficacy and tolerability for treating major depressive disorder (MDD) compared with selective reuptake inhibitors. Pioneer studies provided valuable information on structure, function, and pharmacology of drugs targeting both hSERT and hNET (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, SNRIs), and the differential binding mechanism between SNRIs and selective inhibitors of 5-HT (SSRIs) or NE (sNRIs) to their corresponding targets was expected to be able to facilitate the discovery of a privileged drug-like scaffold with improved efficacy. However, the dual-target mechanism of SNRIs was still elusive, and the binding mode distinguishing SNRIs from SSRIs and sNRIs was also unclear. Herein, an integrated computational strategy was adopted to discover the binding mode shared by all FDA approved SNRIs. The comparative analysis of binding free  at the per-residue level discovered that residues Phe335, Leu337, Gly338, and Val343 located at the transmembrane domain 6 (TM6) of hSERT (the corresponding residues Phe317, Leu319, Gly320, and Val325 in hNET) were the determinants accounting for SNRIs' dual-acting inhibition, while residues lining TM3 and 8 (Ile172, Ser438, Thr439, and Leu443 in hSERT; Val148, Ser419, Ser420, and Met424 in hNET) contributed less to the binding of SNRIs than that of SSRIs and sNRIs. Based on these results, the distances between an SNRI's centroid and the centroids of its two aromatic rings (measuring the depth of rings stretching into hydrophobic pockets) were discovered as the key to the SNRIs' dual-targeting mechanism. This finding revealed SNRIs' binding mechanism at an atomistic level, which could be further utilized as structural blueprints for the rational design of privileged drug-like scaffolds treating MDD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29903607>Improvement of physical activity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by pulmonary rehabilitation and pharmacological treatment.</a></h1><p>Physical activity (PA) is defined as bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles with  expenditure beyond resting levels. PA is closely related to reduced morbidity and mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Self-report questionnaires are often subject to recall bias, correlating poorly with objectively qualified PA, and do not provide an accurate estimate of free-living  expenditure. PA may be objectively evaluated by newly developed tri-axial accelerometers by quantifying steps or body movements over a period of time. Low-intensity, home-based pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) using pedometer feedback improves PA. Improvement in physiological factors correlates with increased walking time in stable elderly COPD patients. This review focuses on the effects of PR and pharmacological treatment on PA in COPD patients. We selected 32 studies from our literature search evaluating the effects of PR and 11 studies examining the effects of pharmacological treatment on PA. Findings in both categories were inconsistent. Nineteen studies showed a positive effect with PR whereas 13 showed no effect. Eight studies showed a positive effect, while three revealed no effect from pharmacological intervention. As both interventions increase exercise capacity without a consistent effect on PA, counseling with behavioral changes may be necessary to achieve a significant and lasting increase in PA. Changing PA behavior in COPD patients requires an interdisciplinary approach involving specialists in respiratory medicine, rehabilitation, social, and behavioral sciences. Future research in this area is warranted to advance our knowledge in this area, specifically with regard to the interaction of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.Copyright © 2018.

However, the predictive power of these models is presently limited by the immature state of the cells. Here we show that this fundamental limitation can be overcome if cardiac tissues are formed from early-stage iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes soon after the initiation of spontaneous contractions and are subjected to physical conditioning with increasing intensity over time. After only four weeks of culture, for all iPSC lines studied, such tissues displayed adult-like gene expression profiles, remarkably organized ultrastructure, physiological sarcomere length (2.2 µm) and density of mitochondria (30%), the presence of transverse tubules, oxidative metabolism, a positive force-frequency relationship and functional calcium handling. Electromechanical properties developed more slowly and did not achieve the stage of maturity seen in adult human myocardium. Tissue maturity was necessary for achieving physiological responses to isoproterenol and recapitulating pathological hypertrophy, supporting the utility of this tissue model for studies of cardiac development and disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30788574>Effect of norepinephrine treatment on Haemonchus contortus and its excretory products.</a></h1><p>Haemonchus contortus is a highly pathogenic gastrointestinal nematode of small ruminant animals. In modern intensive farming, livestock often suffer from different types of stress. However, whether host stress hormones influence H. contortus infection is largely unknown. Therefore, we treated H. contortus with norepinephrine (NE) and analyzed the changes in its excretory/secretory products (ESPs). Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis was used to identify differences in body proteins and ESPs between the control and NE-treated groups. We also investigated the changes in ESP action by analyzing cytokine secretion and goat peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation after incubation with ESPs secreted by NE-treated H. contortus. Thirty-two proteins in the body samples and 137 in the ESPs were differentially expressed between the groups. Gene ontology (GO) annotation showed that the functions of these different proteins might be involved in  metabolism, protein metabolism, lipid metabolism, redox homeostasis, ion channel, and cell structure. NE treatment caused oxidative stress in H. contortus and changed the expression levels of some immunogenic proteins, such as the 15-kDa ESP. Meanwhile, the ESPs secreted by NE-treated H. contortus significantly decreased PBMC proliferation and the interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and interferon-gamma contents. Thus, NE treatment significantly affected the H. contortus body and ESP expression, and changes in the ESPs influenced PBMC function. The results reveal a relationship between host hormones and parasites and provide new clues to explain some of the variation in individual responses to infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30778122>Metabolic adaptation of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli to exposure to bile salts.</a></h1><p>The adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), which colonize the ileal mucosa of Crohn's disease patients, adhere to intestinal epithelial cells, invade them and exacerbate intestinal inflammation. The high nutrient competition between the commensal microbiota and AIEC pathobiont requires the latter to occupy their own metabolic niches to survive and proliferate within the gut. In this study, a global RNA sequencing of AIEC strain LF82 has been used to observe the impact of bile salts on the expression of metabolic genes. The results showed a global up-regulation of genes involved in degradation and a down-regulation of those implicated in biosynthesis. The main up-regulated degradation pathways were , 1,2-propanediol and citrate utilization, as well as the methyl-citrate pathway. Our study reveals that  utilization bestows a competitive advantage of AIEC strains that are metabolically capable of its degradation in the presence of bile salts. We observed that bile salts activated secondary metabolism pathways that communicate to provide an  benefit to AIEC. Bile salts may be used by AIEC as an environmental signal to promote their colonization.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30014712>Effects of feeding diets containing essential oils and betaine to heat-stressed growing-finishing pigs.</a></h1><p>This study was to evaluate the effects of dietary essential oils (EO) and betaine on growth performance, nutrient digestibility and serum hormones in growing-finishing pigs under heat stress conditions. A total of 96 crossed pigs [(Landrace × Yorkshire) × Duroc] with an initial body weight (BW) of 24.7 ± 0.27 kg were used in an 18-week trial. Pigs were randomly allocated to four treatments according to BW and gender. There were six replication pens in each treatment, with four pigs (two barrows and two gilts) per pen. Treatment groups were: (1) control group (CON), basal diet + 23°C for 24 h; (2) heat stress group (HC) with basal diet + 37°C for 9 h, 23°C for 15 h; (3) group HEO, HC with 0.01% EO; (4) group HBE, HC with 0.1% betaine. During the overall period, groups HEO and HBE had higher (p < 0.05) average daily gain than group HC.

At 47 ± 6 d before the expected calving date, 93 multiparous Holstein cows were assigned randomly to 1 of 4 dietary treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Cows were fed  to excess [EXE; 1.63 Mcal of net  for lactation/kg of dry matter (DM)] or to maintenance (MNE; 1.40 Mcal of net  for lactation/kg of DM) in ad libitum amounts throughout the nonlactating period. The RPC was top-dressed for 17 ± 4.6 d prepartum through 21 d postpartum (PP). After calving, cows were fed the same methionine-balanced diet, apart from RPC supplementation, through 15 wk PP. Liver was biopsied at -14, 7, 14, and 21 d relative to parturition. Cows fed EXE or MNE diets, respectively, consumed 40 or 10% more Mcal/d than required at 15 d before parturition. Cows fed the MNE compared with the EXE diet prepartum consumed 1.2 kg/d more DM postpartum but did not produce more milk (41.6 vs. 43.1 kg/d). Thus, PP cows fed the EXE diet prepartum were in greater mean negative  balance, tended to have greater mean concentrations of circulating insulin, fatty acids, and β-hydroxybutyrate, and had greater triacylglycerol in liver tissue (8.3 vs. 10.7% of DM) compared with cows fed the MNE diet prepartum. Cows fed RPC in transition tended to produce more milk (43.5 vs. 41.3 kg/d) and -corrected milk (44.2 vs. 42.0 kg/d) without increasing DM intake (23.8 vs. 23.2 kg/d) during the first 15 wk PP, and tended to produce more milk over the first 40 wk PP (37.1 vs. 35.0 kg/d).  balance of cows fed RPC was more negative at wk 2, 3, and 6 PP, but mean circulating concentrations of fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate did not differ from those of cows not fed RPC. Despite differences in  balance at 2 and 3 wk PP, mean concentration of hepatic triacylglycerol did not differ between RPC treatments. Feeding RPC reduced the daily prevalence of subclinical hypocalcemia from 25.5 to 10.5%, as defined by concentrations of total Ca of <8.0 mg/dL in serum in the first 7 d PP. Pregnancy at first artificial insemination tended to be greater for cows fed RPC (41.3 vs. 23.6%), but the proportion of pregnant cows did not differ by 40 wk PP. Heifers born from singleton calvings from cows fed RPC tended to experience greater daily gain between birth and 50 wk of age than heifers from cows not supplemented with RPC. Feeding RPC for approximately 38 d during the transition period tended to increase yield of milk for 40 wk regardless of amount of  consumed during the pregnant, nonlactating period.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

In addition to the classical "Two-hit" theory, NAFLD has been recognized as a typical gut microbiota-related disease because of the intricate role of gut microbiota in maintaining human health and disease formation. Moreover, gut microbiota is even regarded as a "metabolic organ" that play complementary roles to that of liver in many aspects. The mechanisms underlying gut microbiota-mediated development of NAFLD include modulation of host  metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and bile acid and choline metabolism. As a result, gut microbiota have been emerging as a novel therapeutic target for NAFLD by manipulating it in various ways, including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and herbal components.

The lipophilic antioxidant vitamin E (α-tocopherol; VitE) has an established role in neurological health and cognitive function, but the biological rationale for this action remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated behavioral perturbations due to chronic VitE deficiency in adult zebrafish fed from 45 days to 18-months of age diets that were either VitE-deficient (E-) or VitE-sufficient (E+). We hypothesized that E- zebrafish would display cognitive impairments associated with elevated lipid peroxidation and metabolic disruptions in the brain. Quantified VitE levels at 18-months in E- brains (5.7 ± 0.1 nmol/g tissue) were ~20-times lower than in E+ (122.8 ± 1.1; n = 10/group). Using assays of both associative (avoidance conditioning) and non-associative (habituation) learning, we found E- vs E+ fish were learning impaired. These functional deficits occurred concomitantly with the following observations in adult E- brains: decreased concentrations of and increased peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (especially docosahexaenoic acid, DHA), altered brain phospholipid and lysophospholipid composition, as well as perturbed  (glucose/ketone), phosphatidylcholine and choline/methyl-donor metabolism. Collectively, these data suggest that chronic VitE deficiency leads to neurological dysfunction through multiple mechanisms that become dysregulated secondary to VitE deficiency. Apparently, the E- animals alter their metabolism to compensate for the VitE deficiency, but these compensatory mechanisms are insufficient to maintain cognitive function.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesized that this might also be the case for bubbles, which can be used as ultrasound (US) contrast agents. Therefore, we have compared a series of mixed distearoyl phosphatidylcholine-distearoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DSPC-DPSG) bubbles and with bubbles containing either DSPC or DSPG (and distearoyl -polyethyleneglycol 2000, DSPE-PEG2k). Here, we describe the development, examination of stability  and attenuation of broad frequency US pulses. Novel lipid-stabilized freeze-dried formulations for US applications, using the phospholipids DSPC, DSPG, and PEGylated DSPE-PEG2k and perfluoropropane gas were developed. It was found that the bubbles could effectively be preserved by freeze-drying and then re-constituted by addition of water. Average bubble sizes were around 2 µm for all bubbles after re-constitution. Bubble stability was assessed by evaluating the decay of the US backscattering signal . Bubbles containing DSPG were more stable than bubbles with only DSPC. The composition DSPC:DSPG:DSPE-PEG2k 30:60:10 (molar ratio) was the most stable with an effective half-life of 9.12 min, compared to bubbles without DSPG, which had half-life of 2.05 min. Bubble attenuation of US depended highly on the compositions. Bubbles without DSPG had the highest attenuation indicating higher oscillation the most but were also destroyed by higher  US.

The broad range of potential technological applications makes the use of lipid and lately also polymeric materials a popular choice for constructing biomimetic membranes, where the barrier properties can be controlled by the composition of the membrane constituent elements. Here we investigate the membrane properties reported by the light-induced proton pumping activity of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) reconstituted in three vesicle systems of different membrane composition. Specifically we quantify how the resulting proton influx and efflux rates are influenced by the membrane composition using a variety of membrane modulators. We demonstrate that by adding hydrocarbons to vesicles with reconstituted bR formed from asolectin lipids the resulting transmembrane proton fluxes changes proportional to the carbon chain length when compared against control. We observe a similar proportionality in single-component 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine model membranes when using cholesterol. Lastly we investigate the effects of adding the amphiphilic di-block co-polymer polybutadiene-polyethyleneoxide (PB-PEO) to phospholipid membranes formed from 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine, and 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine. The proton pumping activity of bR (measured as a change in extra-vesicular pH) in mixed lipid/PB-PEO lipid systems is up to six-fold higher compared to that observed for bR containing vesicles made from PB-PEO alone. Interestingly, bR inserts with apparent opposite orientation in pure PB-PEO vesicles as compared to pure lipid vesicles. Addition of equimolar amounts of lipids to PB-PEO results in bR orientation similar to that observed for pure lipids. In conclusion our results show how the barrier properties of the membranes can be controlled by the composition of the membrane. In particular the use of mixed lipid-polymer systems may pave the way for constructing biomimetic membranes tailored for optimal properties in various applications including drug delivery systems, biosensors and  conservation technology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28624789>Pediatric and adult glioblastoma radiosensitization induced by PI3K/mTOR inhibition causes early metabolic alterations detected by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.</a></h1><p>Poor outcome for patients with glioblastomas is often associated with radioresistance. PI3K/mTOR pathway deregulation has been correlated with radioresistance; therefore, PI3K/mTOR inhibition could render tumors radiosensitive. In this study, we show that NVP-BEZ235, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, potentiates the effects of irradiation in both adult and pediatric glioblastoma cell lines, resulting in early metabolic changes detected by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. NVP-BEZ235 radiosensitises cells to X ray exposure, inducing cell death through the inhibition of CDC25A and the activation of p21cip1(CDKN1A). Lactate and phosphocholine levels, increased with radiation, are decreased after NVP-BEZ235 and combination treatment, suggesting that inhibiting the PI3K/mTOR pathway reverses radiation induced metabolic changes. Importantly, NVP-BEZ235 potentiates the effects of irradiation in a xenograft model of adult glioblastoma, where we observed a decrease in lactate and phosphocholine levels after seven days of combination treatment. Although tumor size was not affected due to the short length of the treatment, a significant increase in CASP3 mRNA was observed in the combination group. Taken together, our data suggest that NMR metabolites could be used as biomarkers to detect an early response to combination therapy with PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and radiotherapy in adult and pediatric glioblastoma patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30955643>Integration of proteomics and metabolomics data of early and middle season Hass avocados under heat treatment.</a></h1><p>Ripening heterogeneity of Hass avocados results in inconsistent quality fruit delivered to the triggered and ready to eat markets. This research aimed to understand the effect of a heat shock (HS) prior to controlled atmosphere (CA) storage on the reduction of ripening heterogeneity. HS prior to CA storage reduces more drastically the ripening heterogeneity in middle season fruit. Via correlation network analysis we show the different metabolomics networks between HS and CA. High throughput proteomics revealed 135 differentially expressed proteins unique to middle season fruit triggered by HS. Further integration of metabolomics and proteomics data revealed that HS reduced the glycolytic throughput and induced protein degradation to deliver  for the alternative ripening pathways. l-isoleucine, l-valine, l-aspartic and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase involved in protein degradation were positively correlated to HS samples. Our study provides new insights into the effectiveness of HS in synchronizing ripening of Hass avocados.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is unknown what effect β-agonists have on  expenditure in overweight individuals. Furthermore, the influence of β-agonist R- and S-enantiomer ratio for the increased  expenditure is insufficiently explored.Nineteen males were included in the study of which 14 completed. Subjects were 31.6 (±3.5) years [mean (±95% CI)] and had a fat percentage of 22.7 (±2.1)%. On separate days, subjects received either placebo or inhaled racemic (rac-) formoterol (2 × 27 µg). After an overnight fast,  expenditure and substrate oxidation were estimated by indirect calorimetry at rest and during submaximal exercise. Plasma (R,R)- and (S,S)-formoterol enantiomer levels were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry.At rest,  expenditure and fat oxidation were 12% (P ≤ 0.001) and 38% (P = 0.006) higher for rac-formoterol than placebo. Systemic (R,R):(S,S) formoterol ratio was correlated with change in  expenditure at rest in response to rac-formoterol (r = 0.63, P = 0.028), whereas no association was observed between fat percentage and rac-formoterol-induced change in  expenditure. During exercise,  expenditure was not different between treatments, although carbohydrate oxidation was 15% higher (P = 0.021) for rac-formoterol than placebo. Rac-formoterol-induced shift in substrate choice from rest to exercise was related to plasma ln-rac-formoterol concentrations (r = 0.75, P = 0.005).Selective β-adrenoceptor agonism effectively increases metabolic rate and fat oxidation in overweight individuals. The potential for weight loss induced by β-agonists may be greater for R-enantiopure formulations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30392525>A Randomised Clinical Trial of Buffered Tumescent Local Anaesthesia During Endothermal Ablation for Superficial Venous Incompetence.</a></h1><p>Endovenous thermal ablation (EVTA) is the recommended first line intervention for superficial venous incompetence (SVI). While the infiltration of perivenous tumescent local anaesthesia (TLA) is key to procedural success, it is paradoxically the predominant source of patient reported discomfort. This randomised controlled trial investigates the potential to reduce peri-procedural pain and improve patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), including quality of life (QoL) using TLA buffered to physiological pH.Patients undergoing great saphenous vein EVTA with concomitant phlebectomies were randomised to either standard (ST) or buffered (BT) TLA. Follow up assessments were performed at weeks 1, 6, and 12. The primary outcome was patient reported peri-procedural pain on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes were one week post-procedural pain VAS and analgesia use, QoL (disease specific: Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire [AVVQ]; generic: Short Form-36 [SF-36] and EuroQol 5 Dimensions Questionnaire [EQ-5D]), patient satisfaction VAS, technical success on duplex ultrasound (DUS) examination, and complications.Ninety-seven patients were randomised: 50 to ST and 47 to BT. The groups had comparable baseline demographics, Clinical Etiologic Anatomic Pathological, Venous Clinical Severity Score, QoL, and DUS parameters. Equally, intra-procedural parameters (volume of TLA, length of ablation, and linear  delivered) were also comparable. Peri-procedural pain scores were significantly lower in the BT group with a mean ± SD score of 2.86 ± 3.57 versus 4.44 ± 2.94 (p = .001). Pain scores and analgesia use over the subsequent week were equivalent. SF-36 Bodily Pain domain scores were significantly better in the BT group at week 1 (77 vs. 62; p = .008). AVVQ, SF-36, and EQ-5D scores were otherwise similar between the groups throughout follow up, significantly improving over baseline. Technical success was high in both groups, with no major complications and few minor complications.Buffered TLA offers a significantly lower peri-procedural pain experience for patients undergoing EVTA and should replace current tumescent formulae.Copyright © 2018.

We showed that adrenaline increases, and reserpine decreases aerobic capacity (inferred by cytochrome oxidase activity) in tissue modifying the hepatic content of mitochondrial proteins without changing mitochondrial aerobic capacity. The changes in tissue cytochrome oxidase activity, which agreed with the expression levels of factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, such as PGC-1, NRF-1, and NRF-2, were associated with similar changes in tissue and mitochondrial State 3 respiration. Adrenaline and reserpine induced extensive lipid and protein oxidative damage in tissue and mitochondria. The increase in HO release by respiring mitochondria and the decrease in the activities of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and reductase contributed to the reserpine effect on oxidative damage. The adrenaline effect is more difficult to explain, since the hormone increased the antioxidant enzyme activities but, in respiring mitochondria, increased ROS release rate in the presence of succinate and decreased it in the presence of pyruvate/malate. These opposite changes were due to the increased content of the autoxidizable electron carrier located at complex III and decreased content of that located at complex I. Our data suggest that adrenaline can be involved in the mitochondrial population adaptation which verify in conditions in which an increased body  expenditure verify such as cold exposure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29172718>Lack of effects of myo-inositol on metabolism of primary rat adipocytes.</a></h1><p>Myo-inositol is a ubiquitous cyclitol, has an important regulatory role, and its intracellular depletion is associated with pathological changes. Effects of myo-inositol on adipose tissue are poorly elucidated. In this report, short-term influence of 20, 100, and 500 µM myo-inositol on metabolism of the isolated rat adipocytes was studied. Cells were incubated for 90 min with glucose and insulin with or without myo-inositol and glucose conversion to lipids and lactate release were measured. Moreover, effects of myo-inositol on lipolysis and on the antilipolytic action of insulin were also studied. It was demonstrated that lipogenesis and lactate release were unchanged by myo-inositol. Moreover, lipolytic response to epinephrine and dibutyryl-cAMP was also unchanged. Myo-inositol was also found to be without influence on the antilipolytic action of insulin. Results of this study show that metabolism of the isolated rat adipocytes is not affected by short-term exposure of these cells to myo-inositol.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058350>Sensitive enantioseparation and determination of isoprenaline in human plasma and pharmaceutical formulations.</a></h1><p>A simple, sensitive and fast RPHPLC method was developed and validated for the enantioselective determination of (RS)-isoprenaline (Ipn) in human plasma. The enantiomers were converted to diastereomeric derivatives using s-triazine (cyanuric chloride) based chiral derivatizing reagents. l-isoleucine and l-methionine were introduced as chiral auxiliary in s-triazine and two new monochloro-s-triazine reagents were synthesized. These reagents were characterized and used for synthesis of diastereomeric derivatives of (RS)-Ipn spiked in human plasma. (RS)-Ipn was isolated (purified and characterized) from a commercial pharmaceutical formulation and was used as the standard racemic sample. Structures of the two diastereomeric derivatives were optimized for lowest  using the Gaussian 09 Rev A. 02 program and hybrid density functional B3LYP with 6-31G* basis set which showed the spatial orientation of hydrophobic groups on stereogenic centers in the diastereomeric derivatives. The results were correlated with the mechanism of separation and elution order. Limit of detection values were found to be 24.6 and 26.8 ng mL for the first and second eluting diastereomeric derivatives, respectively.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30986392>Mechanism and impact of catecholamine conversion by Vibrio cholerae.</a></h1><p>Bacterial pathogens are influenced by signaling molecules including the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline which are host-derived hormones and neurotransmitters. Adrenaline and noradrenaline modulate growth, motility and virulence of bacteria. We show that adrenaline is converted by the pathogen Vibrio cholerae to adrenochrome in the course of respiration, and demonstrate that superoxide produced by the respiratory, Na - translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (NQR) acts as electron acceptor in the oxidative conversion of adrenaline to adrenochrome. Adrenochrome stimulates growth of V. cholerae, and triggers specific responses in V. cholerae and in immune cells. We performed a quantitative proteome analysis of V. cholerae grown in minimal medium with glucose as carbon source without catecholamines, or with adrenaline, noradrenaline or adrenochrome. Significant regulation of proteins participating in iron transport and iron homeostasis, in  metabolism, and in signaling was observed upon exposure to adrenaline, noradrenaline or adrenochrome. On the host side, adrenochrome inhibited lipopolysaccharide-triggered formation of TNF-α by THP-1 monocytes, though to a lesser extent than adrenaline. It is proposed that adrenochrome produced from adrenaline by respiring V. cholerae functions as effector molecule in pathogen-host interaction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

After an overnight fast, participants ingested either a placebo or 150mg of octopamine 60min prior to exercise. Trials consisted of 30min of cycle exercise at 55% peak power output, followed by a 30min performance task whereby participants completed as much work (kJ) as possible.Performance was similar between the experimental trials (placebo: 352.8±39kJ; octopamine: 350.9±38.3kJ; Cohen's d effect size=0.05; p=0.380). Substrate oxidation and circulating concentrations of free fatty acids, prolactin and cortisol were similar between trial conditions (all p>0.05). There were also no differences across trials for heart rate or perceived exertion during exercise (both p>0.05).Acute supplementation with a low dose of octopamine did not influence endurance cycle performance, substrate oxidation or circulating hormonal concentrations, which could be due to the low serum octopamine concentrations observed.

Extracts of the bitter orange and other preparations containing p-synephrine have been used worldwide to promote weight loss and for sports performance. The purpose of the study was to measure the action of p-synephrine on hepatic enzyme activities linked to carbohydrate and  metabolism and the levels of adenine mononucleotides. Enzymes and adenine mononucleotides were measured in the isolated perfused rat liver and in vivo after oral administration of the drug (50 and 300 mg/kg) by using standard techniques. p-Synephrine increased the activity of glycogen phosphorylase in vivo and in the perfused liver. It decreased, however, the activities of pyruvate kinase and pyruvate dehydrogenase also in vivo and in the perfused liver. p-Synephrine increased the hepatic pools of adenosine diphosphate and adenosine triphosphate. Stimulation of glycogen phosphorylase is consistent with the reported increased glycogenolysis in the perfused liver and increased glycemia in rats. The decrease in the pyruvate dehydrogenase activity indicates that p-synephrine is potentially capable of inhibiting the transformation of carbohydrates into lipids. The capability of increasing the adenosine triphosphate-adenosine diphosphate pool indicates a beneficial effect of p-synephrine on the cellular energetics.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29793144>Structural confirmation and spectroscopic study of a biomolecule: Norepinephrine.</a></h1><p>The present work deals with the conformational and vibrational spectroscopic study of an important bio-molecule named norepinephrine in gas phase. The FTIR and FTRaman spectrum of norepinephrine in amorphous form were recorded in wavenumber range 4000-400 cm and 4000-50 cm respectively. We have investigated twenty-seven stable conformational structures of norepinephrine molecule. All the calculations have been done using Density Functional Theory with exchange functional B3LYP incorporated with the 6-31++G(d, p) basis set. The effect of hydrochloride on different bond lengths, bond angles and dihedral angles in the most stable conformer has also been studied. The total potential  distribution for both the most stable conformer and the most stable conformer in hydrochloride was performed with the help Normal coordinate analysis method. Most of the calculated vibrational frequencies are in good agreement with the experimental frequencies. The natural bond orbital analysis was also performed to ensure the stability of electronic structures of norepinephrine.

ZnO has been well-documented as an excellent electron-transport material. However, the poor chemical compatibility between ZnO and organo-metal halide perovskite makes it highly challenging to obtain highly efficient and stable PSCs using ZnO as the electron-transport layer. It is demonstrated in this work that the surface passivation of ZnO by a thin layer of MgO and protonated  (EA) readily makes ZnO as a very promising electron-transporting material for creating hysteresis-free, efficient, and stable PSCs. Systematic studies in this work reveal several important roles of the modification: (i) MgO inhibits the interfacial charge recombination, and thus enhances cell performance and stability; (ii) the protonated EA promotes the effective electron transport from perovskite to ZnO, further fully eliminating PSCs hysteresis; (iii) the modification makes ZnO compatible with perovskite, nicely resolving the instability of ZnO/perovskite interface. With all these findings, PSCs with the best efficiency up to 21.1% and no hysteresis are successfully fabricated. PSCs stable in air for more than 300 h are achieved when graphene is used to further encapsulate the cells.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Diagnosis and management of PCa is very complex because the detection of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) has several drawbacks. Metabolomics brings promise for cancer biomarker discovery and for better understanding PCa biochemistry. In this study, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based metabolomic profiling of PCa cell lines was performed. The cell lines include 22RV1 and LNCaP from PCa with androgen receptor (AR) expression, DU145 and PC3 (which lack AR expression), and one normal prostate cell line (PNT2). Regarding the metastatic potential, PC3 is from an adenocarcinoma grade IV with high metastatic potential, DU145 has a moderate metastatic potential, and LNCaP has a low metastatic potential. Using multivariate analysis, alterations in levels of several intracellular metabolites were detected, disclosing the capability of the endometabolome to discriminate all PCa cell lines from the normal prostate cell line. Discriminant metabolites included amino acids, fatty acids, steroids, and sugars.

Participants were in a room calorimeter during and after the exercise challenge. Food intake was adjusted to obtain  balance across 23 h. REE was measured after 22 h after all conditions. Twenty-three-hour urine norepinephrine concentration and serum creatine kinase activity (CrKact) were obtained. Muscle biopsies were obtained in a subset of 15 participants to examine muscle mitochondrial state 2, 3, and 4 fat oxidation.REE was increased 22 h after MIC (64 ± 119 kcal) and HII (103 ± 137 kcal). Markers of muscle damage (CrKact) increased after HII (9.6 ± 25.5 U·L) and MIC (22.2 ± 22.8 U·L), whereas sympathetic tone (urine norepinephrine) increased after HII (1.1 ± 10.6 ng·mg). Uncoupled phosphorylation (states 2 and 4) fat oxidation were related to REE (r = 0.65 and r = 0.55, respectively); however, neither state 2 nor state 4 fat oxidation increased after MIC or HII. REE was not increased after 8 wk of aerobic training when exercise was restrained for 60 h.Under  balance conditions, REE increased 22 h after both moderate-intensity and high-intensity exercise. Exercise-induced muscle damage/repair and increased sympathetic tone may contribute to increased REE, whereas uncoupled phosphorylation does not. These results suggest that moderate- to high-intensity exercise may be valuable for increasing  expenditure for at least 22 h after the exercise.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29705696>MicroRNA-139-5p suppresses myosin heavy chain I and IIa expression via inhibition of the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that are widely involved in a variety of biological processes. Different skeletal muscle fiber type composition exhibits characteristic differences in functional properties and  metabolism of skeletal muscle. However, the molecular mechanism by which miRNAs control the different type of muscle fiber formation is still not fully understood. In the present study, we characterized the role of microRNA-139-5p (miR-139-5p) in the regulation of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoform expression and its underlying mechanisms. Here we found that the expression of miR-139-5p was significantly higher in mouse slow-twitch muscle than in fast-twitch muscle. Overexpression of miR-139-5p downregulated the expression of MyHC I and MyHC IIa, whereas inhibition of miR-139-5p upregulated them. We also found that the levels of calcineurin (CaN), NFATc1, MEF2C and MCIP1.4, which are the components of CaN/NFAT signaling pathway that has shown to positively regulate slow fiber-selective gene expression, were notably inhibited by miR-139-5p overexpression. Furthermore, treatment of phenylephrine (PE), a α1-adrenoceptor agonist, abolished the inhibitory effect of miR-139-5p on MyHC I and MyHC IIa expression. Together, our findings indicated that the role of miR-139-5p in regulating the MyHC isoforms, especially MyHC I and MyHC IIa, may be achieved through inhibiting CaN/NFAT signaling pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This study was performed in a double-blind, randomized crossover fashion consisting of two exhaustive exercise protocols. On each visit the participants consumed either a CA + C (100 mg of CA and 100 mg of C) or placebo (dextrose) capsule. After consumption, participants were monitored throughout a 45-min ingestion period, then completed a repeated Wingate protocol, and were then monitored throughout a 45-min recovery period. Metabolic function was measured through blood glucose, plasma insulin, plasma triglycerides, and plasma catecholamines: epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE). Biomarkers were taken at four different time points; Ingestion period: baseline (I1), post-ingestion period (I2); Recovery period: immediately post-exercise (R1), post-recovery period (R2).A repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant time-dependent increases in plasma E and NE at I2 only in the CA + C trial (p < 0.05), and a significant decrease in blood glucose at I2 in the PLA trial (p < 0.05); however, no meaningful changes in glucose was observed following CA + C ingestion. No changes in insulin or triglycerides were observed during the ingestion period. No trial-dependent differences were observed in the Recovery period. All biomarkers of metabolic recovery were equivalent when evaluating R1 v R2. Participants recovered in a similar time-dependent manner in all markers of metabolism following the PLA and CA + C trials.The findings of this study suggested that normal recommended dosages of 100 mg CA + 100 mg C is sufficient to promote glucose sparing at rest, with modest increases in SNS activity; however, the individual role of CA or C in this response cannot be determined.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29925015>Protein Configurational States Guide Radical Rearrangement Catalysis in  Ammonia-Lyase.</a></h1><p>The adenosylcobalamin- (coenzyme B) dependent  ammonia-lyase (EAL) plays a key role in aminoethanol metabolism, associated with microbiome homeostasis and Salmonella- and Escherichia coli-induced disease conditions in the human gut. To gain molecular insight into these processes toward development of potential therapeutic targets, reactions of the cryotrapped (S)-2-aminopropanol substrate radical EAL from Salmonella typhimurium are addressed over a temperature (T) range of 220-250 K by using T-step reaction initiation and time-resolved, full-spectrum electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The observed substrate radical reaction kinetics are characterized by two pairs of biexponential processes: native decay to diamagnetic products and growth of a non-native radical species and Co(II) in cobalamin. The multicomponent low-T kinetics are simulated by using a minimal model, in which the substrate-radical macrostate, S, is partitioned by a free- barrier into two sequential microstates: 1) S, a relatively high-entropy/high-enthalpy microstate with a protein configuration that captures the nascent substrate radical in the terminal step of radical-pair separation; and 2) S, a relatively low-enthalpy/low-entropy microstate with a protein configuration that enables the rearrangement reaction. The non-native, destructive reaction of S at T ≤ 250 K is caused by a prolonged lifetime in the substrate-radical capture state. Monotonic S decay over 278-300 K indicates that the free- barrier to S and S interconversion is latent at physiological T-values. Overall, the low-temperature studies reveal two protein-configuration microstates and connecting protein-configurational transitions that specialize the S macrostate for the dual functional roles of radical capture and rearrangement enabling. The identification of new, to our knowledge, intermediate states and specific protein-fluctuation contributions to the reaction coordinate represent an advance toward development of novel therapeutic targets in EAL.Copyright © 2018 Biophysical Society.

It has been widely used for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases in China. Although terpene glycoside (TG), the major component in CS, has been shown to possess cardioprotective properties, the mechanism underlying CS-TG's preventive effect against myocardial ischemia injury is unknown. This study was conducted to explore the protective and curative effects of CS-TG against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial ischemic injury in rats and investigate the underlying myocardial protective mechanisms.A rat model of ISO-induced myocardial ischemia was established to evaluate the protective effect of CS-TG in ameliorating heart injury. Myocardial ischemia was induced by administering ISO (40mg/kg/d) subcutaneously for 2 days. Serum was collected and analyzed for the levels of different cardiac biomarkers, and heart tissues were isolated and prepared for ATP analysis, glycogen content determination, histopathology assay, and ultrastructure observation. The regulatory effects of CS-TG on myocardial apoptosis in rats were studied by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, and the levels of cleaved caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 were detected by western blotting. Furthermore, in vitro experiments were conducted to examine whether the CS-TG's cardioprotective effects were linked to the inhibition of apoptosis via activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/serine-threonine kinase AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway.CS-TG (300mg/kg/d) significantly decreased serum levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in ISO-induced myocardial ischemic rats. Analysis of ATP and glycogen contents, myocardial ultrastructure, and pathological examination showed that CS-TG (300mg/kg/d) significantly improved  metabolism and alleviated myocardial injury in vivo. In addition, the expression of p-AKT and p-mTOR in rats subjected to CS-TG significantly elevated, while the levels of caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 dramatically reduced. Moreover, treatment with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, abrogated CS-TG (200μg/mL) induced down-regulation of cleaved caspase-3, Bax/Bcl-2 in the serum.CS-TG protects the heart from ISO-induced myocardial ischemia, potentially by improving cardiac  metabolism and inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis via activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Thus, CS -TG might be a potential therapeutic candidate for the prevention and treatment of myocardial ischemia.Copyright © 2017.

Here we provide evidence for the usefulness of a Drosophila larva model to investigate genetic influence on vulnerability to sugar overconsumption. Using genetic and RNA interference approaches, we show that the activity of the Oamb gene, which encodes a receptor for octopamine (OA, the invertebrate homologue of norepinephrine), plays a major role in controlled sugar consumption. Furthermore, Oamb appears to suppress sugar food intake in fed larvae in an acute manner, and neurons expressing this Oamb receptor do not overlap with neurons expressing Octβ3R, another OA receptor previously implicated in hunger-driven exuberant sugar intake. Together, these results suggest that two separate sub-circuits, defined by Oamb and Octβ3R respectively, co-regulate sugar consumption according to changes in  needs.

Junctional sites at the interface between the two cell types have been observed, although whether direct neurocardiac coupling has a role in heart physiology has not been clearly demonstrated to date. We investigated the dynamics of SN/cardiomyocyte intercellular signalling, both by fluorescence resonance  transfer-based imaging of cAMP in co-cultures, as a readout of cardiac β-adrenergic receptor activation, and in vivo, using optogenetics in transgenic mice with SN-specific expression of Channelrhodopsin-2. We demonstrate that SNs and cardiomyocytes interact at specific sites in the human and rodent heart, as well as in co-cultures. Accordingly, neuronal activation elicited intracellular cAMP increases only in directly contacted myocytes and cell-cell coupling utilized a junctional extracellular signalling domain with an elevated NE concentration. In the living mouse, optogenetic activation of cardiac SNs innervating the sino-atrial node resulted in an instantaneous chronotropic effect, which shortened the heartbeat interval with single beat precision. Remarkably, inhibition of the optogenetically elicited chronotropic responses required a high dose of propranolol (20-50 mg kg ), suggesting that sympathetic neurotransmission in the heart occurs at a locally elevated NE concentration. Our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that the control of cardiac function by SNs occurs via direct intercellular coupling as a result of the establishment of a specific junctional site.© 2018 The Authors.

Sixteen subjects visited the laboratory on 6 occasions and were given (in randomized double-blind manner) 103-mg p-synephrine (S), 233-mg caffeine + 104-mg p-synephrine, 240-mg caffeine, 337-mg caffeine + 46-mg p-synephrine, 325-mg caffeine, or a placebo (PL). The subjects sat quietly for 3 hr while completing mood state questionnaires every 30 min. Venous blood samples were collected at baseline (pre) and 3 hr (post) to determine immune, lipid, and chemistry panels. Compared with PL, no significant supplement differences were observed during the S trial with the exception of differential time effects seen in hematocrit (decrease in PL, no change in S), triglycerides and very low-density lipoproteins (no changes in PL, significant decreases in S), and iron (no change in PL, significant elevation in S). Supplements containing caffeine showed increased feelings of attention, excitement, , and vigor. These data indicate that consumption of 103-mg p-synephrine does not negatively impact acute blood parameters, does not augment the effects of caffeine, or produce stimulant-like perceptual mood effects.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30286437>H NMR-based dynamic metabolomics delineates the therapeutic effects of Baoyuan decoction on isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy.</a></h1><p>Cardiac hypertrophy (CH) is a major risk factor for many serious heart diseases. Sustained CH is catastrophic, resulting in cardiac dysfunction that eventually leads to heart failure (HF). Baoyuan decoction (BYD) is a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula for supplementing and reinforcing Qi, clinically used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, the therapeutic effects of BYD on CH remain unidentified. We herein investigated the effect of BYD on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced CH in rats and the underlying mechanisms by comprehensive pharmacodynamics and H NMR-based dynamic metabolomics analysis of the plasma and urine samples. Results showed that BYD treatment markedly attenuated ISO-induced CH as evidenced by decreasing the left ventricular wall thickness, pathological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, myocardial collagen fiber deposition and apoptosis, and plasma natriuretic peptide levels. Multivariate trajectory analysis revealed that the BYD treatment could restore the CH-disturbed plasma and urinary metabolite profiles towards the normal metabolic status featuring with a time-dependent tendency. Moreover, the key metabolic alterations in CH rats at different BYD-treated time stages involved  metabolism, oxidative stress responses, amino acid metabolism, and gut microbiota metabolism. Of particularly, the significant roles of BYD for treating CH lie in the improvement of cardiac  generation and antioxidant capacity. Our investigation provides a holistic view of BYD for therapeutic intervention of CH through monitoring of the dynamic metabolic changes and the results indicate that BYD may be applied as a potential agent for treating CH.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated whether a single convulsive crisis affects brain glucose/lactate availability and mitochondrial  production. Adult male Wistar rats received a single injection of pentylentetrazol (PTZ, 60 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of glucose and lactate, mitochondrial respirometry, [C]-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake, glycogen content and cell viability in hippocampus were measured. CSF levels of glucose and lactate (mean ± SD) in control animals were 68.08 ± 11.62 mg/dL and 1.17 ± 0.32 mmol/L, respectively. Tonic-clonic seizures increased glucose levels at 10 min (96.25 ± 13.19) peaking at 60 min (113.03 ± 16.34) returning to control levels at 24 h (50.12 ± 12.81), while lactate increased at 10 min (3.23 ± 1.57) but returned to control levels at 360 min after seizures (1.58 ± 0.21). The hippocampal [C]-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake, glycogen content, and cell viability decreased up to 60 min after the seizures onset. Also, an uncoupling between mitochondrial oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis via FoF1-ATP synthase was observed at 10 min, 60 min and 24 h after seizures. In summary, after a convulsive seizure glucose and lactate levels immediately rise within the brain, however, considering the acute impact of this metabolic crisis, mitochondria are not able to increase  production thereby affecting cell viability.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, we explored naturally occurring compounds that induce beige adipocytes by screening for activity to induce mRNA expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells cultured in beige adipocyte differentiation medium. Through screening, p-synephrine, a compound isolated from Citrus unshiu Marcov., was found to be an active compound that increased UCP1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner from a concentration of 3.12 µM, which induced morphological changes specific for beige adipocytes. Similar effects were also observed in SVF cells prepared from db/db obese mice. While investigating the underlying mechanism of p-synephrine-induced beige adipocyte differentiation, we found that the effects of p-synephrine were abolished by the β3-adrenoceptor antagonist SR58894. Intriguingly, p-synephrine increased UCP1 mRNA levels in SVF cells cultured in beige adipocyte differentiation medium lacking insulin to an extent different from those by the β-agonist isoprenaline. Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 decreased isoprenaline-induced UCP1 mRNA levels in the early phase of beige adipocyte differentiation and p-synephrine-induced UCP1 mRNA levels in fully differentiated beige adipocytes. Thus, p-synephrine appears to elicit signals via β3-adrenoceptor combined with some part of the insulin signaling pathway, finally resulting in efficient stimulation of beige adipocyte differentiation with the support of certain beige adipocyte differentiation-inducing factors. The present results suggest the potential of p-synephrine for prophylaxis and treatment of obesity and its associated diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Adenosine and A receptor (A2AR) agonism activate BAT in rodents, and endogenous adenosine is released locally in BAT as a by-product of noradrenaline, but physiological data from humans is lacking. The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the effects of exogenous adenosine on human BAT perfusion, and to determine the density of A2ARs in human BAT in vivo for the first time, using PET/CT imaging.Healthy, lean men (n = 10) participated in PET/CT imaging with two radioligands. Perfusion of BAT, white adipose tissue (WAT) and muscle was quantified with [O]HO at baseline, during cold exposure and during intravenous administration of adenosine. A2AR density of the tissues was quantified with [C]TMSX at baseline and during cold exposure.Adenosine increased the perfusion of BAT even more than cold exposure (baseline 8.3 ± 4.5, cold 19.6 ± 9.3, adenosine 28.6 ± 7.9 ml/100 g/min, p < 0.01). Distribution volume of [C]TMSX in BAT was significantly lower during cold exposure compared to baseline. In cold, low [C]TMSX binding coincided with high concentrations of noradrenaline.Adenosine administration caused a maximal perfusion effect in human supraclavicular BAT, indicating increased oxidative metabolism. Cold exposure increased noradrenaline concentrations and decreased the density of A2AR available for radioligand binding in BAT, suggesting augmented release of endogenous adenosine. Our results show that adenosine and A2AR are relevant for activation of human BAT, and A2AR provides a future target for enhancing BAT metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28875318>Influence of gut microbiota on the development and progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by the presence of steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, with or without fibrosis. The prevalence of NASH has increased with the obesity epidemic, but its etiology is multifactorial. The current studies suggest the role of gut microbiota in the development and progression of NASH. The aim is to review the studies that investigate the relationship between gut microbiota and NASH. These review also discusses the pathophysiological mechanisms and the influence of diet on the gut-liver axis.The available literature has proposed mechanisms for an association between gut microbiota and NASH, such as: modification  homeostasis, lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-endotoxemia, increased endogenous production of ethanol, and alteration in the metabolism of bile acid and choline. There is evidence to suggest that NASH patients have a higher prevalence of bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine and changes in the composition of the gut microbiota. However, there is still a controversy regarding the microbiome profile in this population. The abundance of Bacteroidetes phylum may be increased, decreased, or unaltered in NASH patients. There is an increase in the Escherichia and Bacteroides genus. There is depletion of certain taxa, such as Prevotella and Faecalibacterium.Although few studies have evaluated the composition of the gut microbiota in patients with NASH, it is observed that these individuals have a distinct gut microbiota, compared to the control groups, which explains, at least in part, the genesis and progression of the disease through multiple mechanisms. Modulation of the gut microbiota through diet control offers new challenges for future studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28934191>Effects of aerobic exercise on brain metabolism and grey matter volume in older adults: results of the randomised controlled SMART trial.</a></h1><p>There is mounting evidence that aerobic exercise has a positive effect on cognitive functions in older adults. To date, little is known about the neurometabolic and molecular mechanisms underlying this positive effect. The present study used magnetic resonance spectroscopy and quantitative MRI to systematically explore the effects of physical activity on human brain metabolism and grey matter (GM) volume in healthy aging. This is a randomised controlled assessor-blinded two-armed trial (n=53) to explore exercise-induced neuroprotective and metabolic effects on the brain in cognitively healthy older adults. Participants (age >65) were allocated to a 12-week individualised aerobic exercise programme intervention (n=29) or a 12-week waiting control group (n=24). The main outcomes were the change in cerebral metabolism and its association to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels as well as changes in GM volume. We found that cerebral choline concentrations remained stable after 12 weeks of aerobic exercise in the intervention group, whereas they increased in the waiting control group. No effect of training was seen on cerebral N-acetyl-aspartate concentrations, nor on markers of neuronal  reserve or BDNF levels. Further, we observed no change in cortical GM volume in response to aerobic exercise. The finding of stable choline concentrations in the intervention group over the 3 month period might indicate a neuroprotective effect of aerobic exercise. Choline might constitute a valid marker for an effect of aerobic exercise on cerebral metabolism in healthy aging.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28895788>Association between Serum Unmetabolized Folic Acid Concentrations and Folic Acid from Fortified Foods.</a></h1><p>To investigate the association between serum unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA) concentrations and folic acid from fortified foods and nutrients known as dietary methyl-group donors (folate, methionine, choline, betaine and vitamins B2, B6 and B12) in participants exposed to mandatory fortification of wheat and maize flours with folic acid.Cross-sectional study carried out with 144 healthy Brazilian participants, both sexes, supplement nonusers. Serum folate, UMFA, vitamin B12 and total plasma homocysteine (tHcy) were biochemically measured. Dietary intake was assessed by 2 non-consecutive 24-hour dietary recalls (24-HRs) and deattenuated -adjusted nutrient data were used for statistical analysis.Ninety eight (68.1%) participants were women. Median (interquartile range) age was 35.5 (28.0-52.0) years. Elevated serum folate concentrations (>45 nmol/L) were found in 17 (11.8%), while folate deficiency (<7 nmol/L) in 10 (6.9%) participants. No one had vitamin B12 deficiency (<148 pmol/L). An elevated serum UMFA concentration was defined as > 1 nmol/L (90th percentile). UMFA concentrations were positively correlated with folic acid intake and negatively correlated to choline, methionine and vitamin B6 intakes. Participants in the lowest quartile of UMFA concentrations had lower dietary intake of total folate (DFEs) and folic acid, and higher dietary intake of methionine, choline and vitamin B6 than participants in the highest quartile of UMFA. Folic acid intake (OR [95% CI] = 1.02 [1.01-1.04)] and being a male (OR [95% CI] = 0.40 [0.19-0.87) were associated with increased and reduced odds for UMFA concentrations > 0.55 nmol/L (median values), respectively.UMFA concentrations were directly influenced by folic acid intake from fortified foods in a healthy convenience sample of adult Brazilians exposed to mandatory flour fortification with folic acid.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28389413>Influence of cell confluence on the cAMP signalling pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells.</a></h1><p>The influence of cell confluence on the β-adrenoceptor (β-AR)/cAMP/phosphodiesterase (PDE) pathway was investigated in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs). Cells were plated either at low density (LD: 3·10cells/cm) or high density (HD: 3·10cells/cm) corresponding to non-confluent or confluent cells, respectively, on the day of experiment. β-AR-stimulated cAMP was monitored in real-time using the fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET)-based cAMP sensor, Epac2-camps. A brief application (15s) of the β-AR agonist isoprenaline (Iso) induced a typical transient FRET signal, reflecting cAMP production followed by its rapid degradation. The amplitude of this response, which increased with the concentration of Iso (10 or 100nM), was higher in HD than in LD cells, whatever the Iso concentration used. However, activation of adenylyl cyclase by L-858051 (100μM) induced a similar saturating response in both LD and HD cells. A β-AR antagonist (CGP 20712A, 100nM) reduced the Iso (100nM) response in HD but not LD cells, whereas a β-AR antagonist (ICI 118,551, 5nM) reduced this response in HD cells and almost abolished it in LD cells. Competitive [I]-ICYP binding experiments with betaxolol, a β-AR ligand, identified two binding sites in HD cells, corresponding to β- and β-ARs with a proportion of 11% and 89%, respectively, but only one binding site in LD cells, corresponding to β-ARs. Total cAMP-PDE activity (assessed by a radioenzymatic assay) was increased in HD cells compared to LD cells. This increase was associated with a rise in mRNA expression of five cAMP-PDEs subtypes (PDE1A, 3A, 4A, 4B and 7B) in HD cells, and a decrease in basal [cAMP] (assessed by an EIA assay). PDE4 inhibition with Ro-20-1724 (10μM) strongly prolonged the Iso response in LD and HD cells, whereas PDE3 inhibition with cilostamide (1μM) slightly prolonged Iso response only in LD cells. Interestingly, inhibition of PDE4 unmasked an effect of PDE3 in HD cells. Our results show that in cultured RASMCs, the β-AR/cAMP/PDE signalling pathway is substantially modulated by the cell density. In HD cells, Iso response involves both β- and β-AR stimulation and is mainly controlled by PDE4, PDE3 being recruited only after PDE4 inhibition. In LD cells, Iso response involves only β-AR stimulation and is controlled by PDE4 and to a lower degree by PDE3. This low density state is associated with an absence of membrane expression of the β-AR, a lower cAMP-PDE activity and a higher basal [cAMP]. This study highlights the critical role of the cellular environment in controlling the vascular β-AR signalling.Copyright © 2017.

This new system can improve treatment of intermittent fecal incontinence.The low-temperature system was integrated with a hollow microneedle to maintain the low temperature of the sol formulation. Various sol-gel formulations using Pluronic F-127 (PF-127) and Hydroxy-propyl-methyl-cellulose (HPMC) were prepared, and their gelation temperature, flow property, and diffusion retardation were observed. Resting anal sphincter pressure in response to a phenylephrine (PE) sol-gel formulation was measured using an air-charged catheter. The biocompatibility of the sol-gel PE formulation was evaluated by observing the immunological response.When the PF-127 25%, HPMC 1% and PE formulation (PF25-HPMC1-PE) was injected through the peri-anal skin of the rat in vivo, the highest pressure on the anal sphincter muscle occurred at 6-8 h and anal pressure increased and lasted twice as long as with the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-PE formulation. There was no significant difference in the number of mast cells after administration into the rat in vivo between the PF25-HPMC1-PE formulation and the PBS-PE formulation.The combination of a low-pain hollow microneedle system and an injectable sol-gel formulation improved the efficacy of treatment of intermittent fecal incontinence. A low-temperature hollow microneedle system using a sol-gel formulation has many applications in medical treatments that require depot effect, local targeting, and pain control.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28962788>Choline chloride vs choline ionic liquids for starch thermoplasticization.</a></h1><p>Native starch containing 12% water was melt processed in presence of 23% of various plasticizers at 120°C, either by simple compression molding or by extrusion using a laboratory scale microcompounder. Glycerol, a typical starch plasticizer, was used as a reference and compared to three choline salts: raw choline chloride (which is a solid in dry state with a melting point above 300°C), and two ionic liquids synthesized from this precursor (choline acetate and choline lactate, liquids below 100°C). These ionic plasticizers were shown to allow a more efficient melting of native starch in both processes. The investigation of macromolecular structure changes during processing shows that this efficiency can be ascribed to a starch chain scission mechanism, resulting in lower specific mechanical  input need for starch thermoplasticization compared to glycerol plasticized starch. Compared to the synthesized ionic liquids, raw commercial choline chloride leads to a good compromise between limited chain scission, and final water uptake and thermomechanical properties.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Norepinephrine (NE), a stress-related hormone and 17-β-estradiol (E2) thought to influence tau phosphorylation (p-tau) and AD pathology. The controversy around the impact of NE and E2 requires further clarification. Moreover, the combination effect of physiological and psychological stress and estrogen alteration during menopause, which affect p-tau, has not been addressed. Exposure to E2 is believed to reduce NE release, however, the link between these two hormones and AD at cellular level was also remained unknown. Here, we examined whether NE and E2 treatment of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells affected tau phosphorylation. The involvement of adenosine monophosphate kinase protein kinase (AMPK) and target of Rapamycin (mTOR) as the possible mechanisms, underlying this effect was also investigated. Subsequent to SH-SY5Y differentiation to mature neurons, we treated the cells with NE, E2 and NE plus E2 in presence and absence of Compound C and Rapamycin. Cell viability was not affected by our treatment while our Western blot and immunofluorescent findings showed that exposure to NE and E2 separately, and in combination enhanced p-tau (Ser) and (Ser)/tau but not (Ser/Thr)/tau. Blocking AMPK by Compound C reduced p-tau (Ser) and (Ser), while GSK-3β and PP2A activities were remained unchanged. We also found that blocking mTOR by Rapamycin did not change increased p-tau (Ser) and (Ser) due to NE + E2 treatment. Collectively, our results suggested that tau hyperphosphorylation due to exposure to NE/E2 was mediated by AMPK, the main  regulator of cells during stress with no significant involvement of mTOR, GSK-3β and PP2A.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Numerous methods have been reported for the analysis of GA and UA in various real samples. However, the development of a simple, rapid and practical sensor still remains a great challenge. Here, a carbon paste electrode (CPE) was modified by nanocomposite containing zirconia nanoparticles (ZrONPs), Choline chloride (ChCl) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to construct ZrO-ChCl-AuNPs/CPE as electrochemical sensor for the simultaneous electro-oxidation of GA and UA. Characterization was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy and  dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The modified electrode was investigated by different methods including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Kinetic parameters such as charge transfer coefficient, standard heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant and other parameters were calculated via voltammetry techniques. Differential pulse voltammetry was used for simultaneous determination of GA and UA applying the ZrO-ChCl-AuNPs/CPE electrode. At the optimum conditions, this sensor showed a linear response in the ranges 0.22- 55 and 0.12-55 µM for GA and UA, respectively. In addition, low detection limits of 25 and 15 nM were obtained for GA and UA, respectively. Furthermore, ZrO-ChCl-AuNPs/CPE was successfully applied for the independent determination of GA in green tea and fruit juice as well as the simultaneous determination of GA and UA in human urine samples.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we demonstrated that inflamed dysfunctional adipose tissue plays a crucial role in cholesterol-induced NMS. Control (C), high cholesterol (HC) and HC with 10% fructose in drinking water (HCF) diets were fed to Sprague-Dawley rats for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, the body weights of the C- and HC-fed rats were comparable, but the weights of the HCF-fed rats were relatively low. Cholesterol caused metabolic problems such as high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia and hypoinsulinemia. The HCF-fed rats exhibited whole-body insulin resistance with low circulating high-density lipoprotein levels. Increases in the tumor necrosis factor α level in the plasma, the number of CD68+ macrophages and the free nuclear factor-κB level in gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) resulted in local inflammation, which appeared as inflamed dysfunctional gWAT. Reduced superoxide dismutases (SODs) deteriorate natural antioxidant defense systems and induce reactive oxygen species in gWAT. Dysregulation of plasma levels of catecholamine, adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipin in cholesterol-induced inflamed adipose tissue contributed to increased lipolysis and increased circulating nonesterified fatty acids. Cholesterol activated inflammation, lipolysis and cell death in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, Chol-3T3-CM reduced the population of M2-type Raw264.7 macrophages, indicating that the macrophage polarization is mediated by cholesterol. Together, our findings indicate that inflamed dysfunctional adipocytes are critical in NMS, supporting the development of anti-inflammatory agents as potential therapeutic drugs for treating NMS.© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30247032>Calculating Kinetic Rates and Membrane Permeability from Biased Simulations.</a></h1><p>We present a simple approach to calculate the kinetic properties of lipid membrane crossing processes from biased molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that by using biased simulations, one can obtain highly accurate kinetic information with significantly reduced computational time with respect to unbiased simulations. We describe how to conveniently calculate the transition rates to enter, cross, and exit the membrane in terms of the mean first passage times. To obtain free  barriers and relaxation times from biased simulations only, we constructed Markov models using the dynamic histogram analysis method (DHAM). The permeability coefficients that are calculated from the relaxation times are found to correlate highly with experimentally evaluated values. We show that more generally, certain calculated kinetic properties linked to the crossing of the membrane layer (e.g., barrier height and barrier crossing rates) are good indicators of ordering drugs by permeability. Extending the analysis to a 2D Markov model provides a physical description of the membrane crossing mechanism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28277146>Efficacy of gold nanoparticles against isoproterenol induced acute myocardial infarction in adult male albino rats.</a></h1><p>This study was undertaken to investigate the role of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) of 50 nm diameter on isoproterenol (ISO) induced acute myocardial infarction in adult male albino rats. Forty five adult Wistar male albino rats were equally divided into three groups. Control (group I) was further subdivided into three subgroups. In group II, the rats received ISO subcutaneously at a dose of 100 mg/kg for three days. In group III, rats received ISO as group II and then GNPs (400 μg/kg/day) intravenously for 14 consecutive days. Echocardiography was performed. Left ventricular specimens were prepared for H&E, van Gieson staining, immunohistochemical analysis for (eNOs and Bcl-2), and Electron microscope examination.  dispersive X-ray microanalysis was also performed. Cardiac markers such as creatine Kinase-MB (CK-MB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) were measured. Group II revealed cardiomyocytes with deeply stained acidophilic cytoplasm, small dark nuclei, intracellular vacuolations, wide intercellular spaces, and extravasated red blood cells. Increased collagen fibers were observed. Electron microscope examination showed cardiomyocyte with small and irregular outlined nuclei, mitochondria with irregular cristae and others with ruptured mitochondrial membrane, abnormal alignment of myofibrils, dilated cisternae of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and disorganized intercalated discs. Group III showed that most cardiomyocytes preserved the normal architecture. Increased expression of eNOs immunoreaction and decreased Bcl-2 immunoreaction were detected in group II as compared to the control and GNP-treated groups. These ﬁndings suggested that GNPs of 50 nm diameter improved myocardial injury after ISO-induced myocardial infarction in rats.Myocardial infarction (MI), Isoproterenol (ISO), Nitric oxide (NO), Neuronal NOS (nNOs), Endothelial NOs (eNOs), Gold nanoparticle (GNPs), Diamiobenzidine (DAB), Serum Creatine Kinase-MB (CK-MB), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Cardiac troponin T (cTnT), Electrochemiluminiscence (ECLIA), Cardiomyocytes (CMC), Peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor (PPARs), Reactive oxygen species (ROS).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29361592>Stress decreases pollen foraging performance in honeybees.</a></h1><p>Foraging in honeybees is energetically demanding. Here, we examined whether stressors, which generally increase metabolic demands, can impair foraging performance. A controlled non-pathogenic stressor (immune challenge) resulted in a change in the foraging preferences of bees. It reduced pollen foraging and increased the duration of trips in pollen foragers. Stress also reduced the amount of octopamine in the brain of pollen foragers (a biogenic amine involved in the regulation of foraging and flight behaviour in insects). According to the literature, flight metabolic rate is higher during pollen foraging than during nectar foraging, and nectar gives a higher energetic return relative to the foraging effort when compared with pollen. We thus propose that stress might be particularly detrimental to the performance of pollen foragers, and stressed bees prefer the -rich resource of nectar. In conclusion, stress, even at low levels, could have consequences for bee foraging behaviour and thereby the nutritional balance of the colony.© 2018.

Exogenous fatty acid uptake was detected in melanoma tumor nodules by PET using the palmitic acid surrogate tracer 14(R,S)-18F-fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid ([18F]-FTHA), consistent with upregulation of genes associated with fatty acid uptake found through microarray analysis. DESI-MS imaging revealed that FTHA uptake in tumors was heterogeneous. Transcriptome and lipidome analyses further highlighted dysregulation of glycerophospholipid pathways in melanoma tumor nodules, including increased abundance of phosphatidyl  and phosphatidyl choline species, corroborated by DESI-MS, which again revealed heterogeneous phospholipid composition in tumors. Overexpression of the gene encoding lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which was upregulated in zebrafish melanocyte tumor nodules and expressed in the majority of human melanomas, accelerated progression of oncogenic RAS-driven melanocyte neoplasia in zebrafish. Depletion or antagonism of LPL suppressed human melanoma cell growth; this required simultaneous fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibition when FASN expression was also elevated. Collectively, our findings implicate fatty acid acquisition as a possible therapeutic target in melanoma, and the methods we developed for monitoring fatty acid uptake have potential for diagnosis, patient stratification, and monitoring pharmacologic response. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate the translational potential of monitoring fatty acid uptake and identify lipoprotein lipase as a potential therapeutic target in melanoma.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29053759>Molecular dynamic simulations reveal suboptimal binding of salbutamol in T164I variant of β2 adrenergic receptor.</a></h1><p>The natural variant C491T (rs1800088) in ADRB2 gene substitutes Threonine to Isoleucine at 164th position in β2AR and results in receptor sequestration and altered binding of agonists. Present investigation pursues to identify the effect of T164I variation on function and structure of β2AR through systematic computational approaches. The study, in addition, addresses altered binding of salbutamol in T164I variant through molecular dynamic simulations. Methods involving changes in free , solvent accessibility surface area, root mean square deviations and analysis of binding cavity revealed structural perturbations in receptor to incur upon T164I substitution. For comprehensive understanding of receptor upon substitution, OPLS force field aided molecular dynamic simulations were performed for 10 ns. Simulations revealed massive structural departure for T164I β2AR variant from the native state along with considerably higher root mean square fluctuations of residues near the cavity. Affinity prediction by molecular docking showed two folds reduced affinity of salbutamol in T164I variant. To validate the credibility docking results, simulations for ligand-receptor complex were performed which demonstrated unstable salbutamol-T164I β2AR complex formation. Further, analysis of interactions in course of simulations revealed reduced ligand-receptor interactions of salbutamol in T164I variant. Taken together, studies herein provide structural rationales for suboptimal binding of salbutamol in T164I variant through integrated molecular modeling approaches.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28429671> Metabolism in the Mammalian Gastrointestinal Tract: Mechanisms, Patterns, and Importance.</a></h1><p>Nutritional exchanges and cooperation between bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract and the mammalian host play an important role in health and disease.  is an essential dietary lipid nutrient for animals and is abundant in both intestinal and bacterial cell membranes.  can be utilized by intestinal eukaryotic cells via the cytidine phosphoethanolamine pathway for de novo synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine, and certain bacteria are able to catabolize it as a major carbon and/or nitrogen source with the help of  utilization proteins. In addition,  utilization dramatically affects lipid metabolism and short-chain fatty acid biosynthesis.  metabolism plays a significant role in the renewal and proliferation of intestinal cells and intestinal inflammation, and  may be a nutritional target to diagnose or treat diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease. This review summarizes the mechanisms of  metabolism in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract and its influence on intestinal health and immunity, thus providing a theoretical reference for further studies on mammalian nutrition and disease.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30326592>Maternal Choline and Betaine Supplementation Modifies the Placental Response to Hyperglycemia in Mice and Human Trophoblasts.</a></h1><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is characterized by excessive placental fat and glucose transport, resulting in fetal overgrowth. Earlier we demonstrated that maternal choline supplementation normalizes fetal growth in GDM mice at mid-gestation. In this study, we further assess how choline and its oxidation product betaine influence determinants of placental nutrient transport in GDM mice and human trophoblasts. C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat (HF) diet 4 weeks prior to and during pregnancy to induce GDM or fed a control normal fat (NF) diet. The HF mice also received 25 mM choline, 85 mM betaine, or control drinking water. We observed that GDM mice had an expanded placental junctional zone with an increased area of glycogen cells, while the thickness of the placental labyrinth zone was decreased at E17.5 compared to NF control mice ( < 0.05). Choline and betaine supplementation alleviated these morphological changes in GDM placentas. In parallel, both choline and betaine supplementation significantly reduced glucose accretion ( < 0.05) in in vitro assays where the human choriocarcinoma BeWo cells were cultured in high (35.5 mM) or normal (5.5 mM) glucose conditions. Expression of angiogenic genes was minimally altered by choline or betaine supplementation in either model. In conclusion, both choline and betaine modified some but not all determinants of placental transport in response to hyperglycemia in mouse and in vitro human cell line models.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29935920>Profiling plasma N-Acylethanolamine levels and their ratios as a biomarker of obesity and dysmetabolism.</a></h1><p>N-acylethanolamines play different roles in  balance; anandamide (AEA) stimulates  intake and storage, N-palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) counters inflammation, and N-oleoylethanolamide (OEA) mediates anorectic signals and lipid oxidation. Inconsistencies in the association of plasma N-acylethanolamines with human obesity and cardiometabolic risk have emerged among previous studies, possibly caused by heterogeneous cohorts and designs, and by unstandardized N-acylethanolamine measurements. We aimed to characterize changes in the plasma profile, including N-acylethanolamine levels and ratios associated with obesity, menopause in women, and ageing in men, and to define the significance of such a profile as a biomarker for metabolic imbalance.Adult, drug-free women (n = 103 premenopausal and n = 81 menopausal) and men (n = 144) were stratified according to the body mass index (BMI) into normal weight (NW; BMI: 18.5-24.9 kg/m), overweight (OW; BMI: 25.0-29.9 kg/m), and obese (OB; BMI ≥30.0 kg/m). Anthropometric and metabolic parameters were determined. Validated blood processing and analytical procedures for N-acylethanolamine measurements were used. We investigated the effect of BMI and menopause in women, and BMI and age in men, as well as the BMI-independent influence of metabolic parameters on the N-acylethanolamine profile.BMI and waist circumference directly associated with AEA in women and men, and with PEA in premenopausal women and in men, while BMI directly associated with OEA in premenopausal women and in men. BMI, in both genders, and waist circumference, in women only, inversely associated with PEA/AEA and OEA/AEA. Menopause increased N-acylethanolamine levels, whereas ageing resulted in increasing OEA relative abundance in men. AEA and OEA abundances in premenopausal, and PEA and OEA abundances in lean menopausal women, were directly associated with hypertension. Conversely, PEA and OEA abundances lowered with hypertension in elderly men. Insulin resistance was associated with changes in N-acylethanolamine ratios specific for premenopausal (reduced PEA/AEA and OEA/AEA), menopausal (reduced OEA/AEA) women and men (reduced OEA/AEA and OEA/PEA). PEA and OEA levels increased with total cholesterol, and OEA abundance specifically increased with HDL-cholesterol. Elevated triglyceride levels were associated with increased N-acylethanolamine levels only in menopausal women.Obesity-related N-acylethanolamine hypertone is characterized by imbalanced N-acylethanolamine ratios. The profile given by a combination of N-acylethanolamine absolute levels and ratios enables imbalances to be identified in relationship with different metabolic parameters, with specific relevance according to gender, menopause and age, representing a useful means for monitoring metabolic health. Finally, N-acylethanolamine system appears a promising target for intervention strategies.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

These oxides were synthesized by combustion method using cobalt nitrate, manganese acetate and ferric nitrate as precursors in the presence of sugar and . The crystallite size, shape and morphology of nano material were characterized by X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and -dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) techniques. The crystallite sizes of synthesized nano-particles (nps) were in the range from 10 to 12 nm (calculated using Debye-Scherrer equation) with cubic crystal system. These particles were utilized as electrode modified with graphite for simultaneous detection of paracetamol and dopamine through cyclic voltammetry and Differential pulse voltammetry techniques and was found to be superior to reported literatures. The minimum detection limit of paracetamol and dopamine at CoFeO/GP electrode were 250 nM and 350 nM while at MnFeO/GP electrode it was 300 nM and 400 nM, respectively. Both the electrodes exhibited the linearity range from3 μM to 200 μM & 3 μM-160 μM for paracetamol and 3 μM-180 μM & 5 μM to 200 for dopamine, respectively. Two oxidation peaks of paracetamol and dopamine were well separated in phosphate buffer (pH = 6) in mixture with 100 mVs and 50 mVs scan rate for cyclic voltammetry and Differential pulse voltammetry, respectively. Both the electrodes demonstrated satisfactory results in real samples of paracetamol and dopamine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29719233>Toward an Understanding of How Immune Cells Control Brown and Beige Adipobiology.</a></h1><p>Immune cells were recently found to have an unexpected involvement in controlling the thermogenic activity of brown and beige adipose tissue. Here, we review how macrophages, eosinophils, type 2 innate lymphoid cells, and T lymphocytes are linked to this process. In particular, the recruitment of alternatively activated macrophages and eosinophils is associated with brown fat activation and white fat browning. Conversely, pro-inflammatory immune cell recruitment represses the thermogenic activity of brown and beige adipose tissues via cytokines that inhibit noradrenergic signaling. Macrophages also influence the noradrenergic tone by degrading norepinephrine locally and by inhibiting sympathetic innervation over time.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

To define the ability of methyl donor supplementation (MDS) to reduce hepatic lipid content and modify the plasma lipidome, 30 multiparous Holstein cows (2.04 ± 0.69 lactations; 689 ± 58 kg of body weight; 3.48 ± 0.10 units of body condition score) were fed a ration with or without rumen-protected methyl donors (22 g/d of Met, 10 g/d of choline chloride, 3 g/d of betaine, 96 mg/d of riboflavin, and 1.4 mg/d of vitamin B) from d -28 before expected calving through d 14 postpartum. Cows were randomly enrolled based on predefined selection criteria (body condition score and parity). Base diets without MDS were formulated for gestation (15.4% crude protein with a predicted Lys-to-Met ratio of 3.25; 1.44 Mcal of net  for lactation/kg of dry matter) and lactation (16.6% crude protein with a predicted Lys-to-Met ratio of 3.36; 1.64 Mcal of net  for lactation/kg of dry matter). Blood sampling occurred from d -28 relative to expected calving through d 14 postpartum. Liver tissue was biopsied at d -28 relative to expected calving and on d 5 and 14 postpartum. In addition to routine analyses, serum AA concentrations on d 10 and 12 were quantified using mass spectrometry. Plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) and cholesteryl esters (CE) were qualitatively measured using time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed using a mixed model with repeated measures. Dry matter intake and milk yield were not modified by MDS. The transition from d -28 relative to expected parturition to d 14 postpartum was characterized by increased plasma fatty acid (0.15 to 0.71 mmol/L) and β-hydroxybutyrate (0.34 to 0.43 mmol/L) levels and liver lipid content (3.91 to 9.16%). Methyl donor supplementation increased the serum Met level by 26% and decreased the serum Lys-to-Met ratio by 21% on d 10 and 12, respectively. Moreover, the increase in hepatic lipid content from d 5 through 14 postpartum was suppressed with MDS relative to control (3.57 vs. -0.29%). Dietary MDS modified the TAG and CE lipidome. For example, MDS increased plasma TAG 46:3 (carbon number:double bond) by 116% relative to control cows on d 5 postpartum. Moreover, MDS tended to increase plasma CE 34:6. In contrast, MDS lowered plasma TAG 54:8 by 39% relative to control cows on d 5 postpartum. We concluded that in the absence of gains in dry matter intake and milk and milk protein yields, dietary MDS slows the progression of hepatic lipid accumulation and modifies the plasma TAG lipidome in transition cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Twelve multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows that calved in late winter in a seasonally calving pasture-based dairying system were managed for a 670-d lactation by delaying rebreeding. In each of four 40-d experimental periods commencing at 73, 217, 422, and 520 (±9.1) d in milk (DIM), cows were offered a diet of perennial ryegrass (73 and 422 DIM) or pasture hay and silage (217 and 520 DIM), supplemented with 1 (CON; n = 6) or 6 kg of grain (GRN; n = 6) as a ration. Daily  intake was approximately 160 and 215 MJ of metabolizable /cow for the CON and GRN treatments, respectively. At all other times, cows were managed as a single herd and grazed pasture supplemented with grain to an estimated daily total intake of 180 MJ of metabolizable /cow. Cows were fitted with a jugular catheter during the final week of each experimental period. Two doses of epinephrine (0.1 and 1.6 µg/kg of body weight) were infused via the catheter 2 h apart to each cow at approximately 100, 250, 460, and 560 DIM. Blood plasma concentrations of glucose and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) were measured before and after infusions. Cows in the GRN treatment had greater milk yield, milk fat and protein yields, and body weight than cows in the CON treatment. The maximum plasma glucose concentration was observed at 100 DIM for both the low and high doses of epinephrine. Thus, sensitivity and responsiveness to exogenous epinephrine were greater during early lactation, coinciding with increased priority of milk synthesis. Both the sensitivity and responsiveness to epinephrine decreased with decreasing milk yield, as measured by the acute appearance of NEFA in the plasma. Increased plasma glucose and NEFA clearance rates before 300 DIM indicated greater uptake of these substrates by the mammary gland for milk synthesis in early and mid lactation. These results support previous findings that major changes occur in terms of adipose tissue metabolism during extended lactations. Overall, sensitivity to epinephrine was not affected by diet, but responsiveness was greater in cows fed the GRN diet. The endocrine regulation of nutrient partitioning throughout traditional and extended lactations is complex, with many interactions between stage of lactation, diet, and milk yield potential.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

However, whether alternatively activated macrophages produce catecholamine and substantially promote adaptive thermogenesis in adipose tissue remains controversial. Here, we show that tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrH), a rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis, was expressed and phosphorylated in adipose-resident macrophages. In addition, the plasma level of adrenaline was increased by cold stress in mice, and treatment of macrophages with adrenaline stimulated phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and TyrH. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of CaMKII or PKA signaling diminished adrenaline-induced phosphorylation of TyrH in primary macrophages. Consistently, overexpression of constitutively active CaMKII upregulated basal TyrH phosphorylation, while suppressing the stimulatory effect of adrenaline on TyrH in macrophages. Myeloid-specific disruption of CaMKIIγ suppressed both the cold-induced production of norepinephrine and adipose UCP1 expression in vivo and the stimulatory effect of adrenaline on macrophage-dependent activation of brown adipocytes in vitro. Lack of CaMKII signaling attenuated catecholamine production mediated by cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, key inducers of type 2 immune response in primary macrophages. Taken together, these results suggest a feedforward mechanism of adrenaline in adipose-resident macrophages, and that myeloid CaMKII signaling plays an important role in catecholamine production and subsequent beige fat activation.© The Author (2017).

The observed first-order rate constants display a piecewise-continuous Arrhenius dependence, with linear regions over 295 → 220 K (monoexponential) and 214 → 203 K (biexponential) that are delineated by a kinetic bifurcation and kinks at 219 and 217 K, respectively. The results are interpreted by using a free  landscape model and derived microscopic kinetic mechanism. The bifurcation and kink transitions correspond to the effective quenching of two distinct sets of native collective protein configurational fluctuations that (1) reconfigure the protein within the substrate radical free  minimum, in a reaction-enabling step, and (2) create the protein configurations associated with the chemical step. Below 217 K, the substrate radical decay reaction persists. Increases in activation enthalpy and entropy of both the microscopic enabling and reaction steps indicate that this non-native reaction coordinate is conducted by local, incremental fluctuations. Continuity in the Arrhenius relations indicates that the same sets of protein groups and interactions mediate the rearrangement over the 295 to 203 K range, but with a repertoire of configurations below 217 K that is restricted, relative to the native configurations accessible above 219 K. The experimental features of a culled reaction step, first-order kinetic measurements, and wide room-to-cryogenic temperature range, allow the direct demonstration and kinetic characterization of protein dynamical contributions to the core adiabatic, bond-making/bond-breaking reaction in EAL.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28823463>Role of hindbrain adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in hypothalamic AMPK and metabolic neuropeptide adaptation to recurring insulin-induced hypoglycemia in the male rat.</a></h1><p>Glucose counter-regulatory dysfunction correlates with impaired activation of the hypothalamic metabolic sensor adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Hypothalamic AMPK is controlled by hindbrain  status; we examined here whether hindbrain AMPK regulates hypothalamic AMPK and metabolic neurotransmitter maladaptation to recurring insulin-induced hypoglycemia (RIIH). Brain tissue was harvested after single versus serial insulin (I) dosing for Western blot analysis of AMPK, phospho-AMPK (pAMPK), and relevant biosynthetic enzyme/neuropeptide expression in micro-punch dissected arcuate (ARH), ventromedial (VMH), dorsomedial (DMH) nuclei and lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) tissue. The AMPK inhibitor compound c (Cc) or vehicle was administered to the caudal fourth ventricle ahead of antecedent I injections. RIIH caused site-specific elevation (ARH, VMH, LHA) or reduction (DMH) of total AMPK protein versus acute hypoglycemia; Cc respectively exacerbated or attenuated this response in the ARH and VMH. Hindbrain AMPK correspondingly inhibited or stimulated LHA and DMH pAMPK expression during RIIH. RIIH elicited Cc-reversible augmentation of VMH glutamate decarboxylase profiles, but stimulated (ARH pro-opiomelanocortin; LHA orexin-A) or decreased (VMH nitric oxide synthase) other metabolic neurotransmitters without hindbrain sensor involvement. Results demonstrate acclimated up-regulation of total AMPK protein expression in multiple hypothalamic loci during RIIH, and document hindbrain sensor contribution to amplification of this protein profile in the VMH. Concurrent lack of net change in ARH and VMH tissue pAMPK implies adaptive reductions in local sensor activity, which may/may not reflect positive gain in  state. It remains unclear if 'glucose-excited' VMH GABAergic and/or ARH pro-opiomelanocortin neurons exhibit AMPK habituation to RIIH, and whether diminished sensor activation in these and other mediobasal hypothalamic neurotransmitter populations may contribute to HAAF.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

As reported recently, the AtPECP1 gene encodes a phosphatase with in vitro substrate specificity for phosphoethanolamine and phosphocholine. The putative substrates suggested that AtPECP1 is related to phospholipid metabolism; however, the biological function of AtPECP1 is as yet not understood. In addition, whereas lipid remodelling processes as part of the phosphorus starvation response have been extensively studied, knowledge of the polar head group metabolism and its regulation is lacking. We found that AtPECP1 is expressed in the cytosol and exerts by far its strongest activity in roots of phosphate-starved plants. We established a novel LC-MS/MS-based method for the quantitative and simultaneous measurement of the head group metabolites. The analysis of Atpecp1 null mutants and overexpression lines revealed that phosphoethanolamine, but not phosphocholine is the substrate of AtPECP1 in vivo. The impact on head group metabolite levels is greatest in roots of both loss-of-function and gain-of-function transgenic lines, indicating that the biological role of AtPECP1 is mainly restricted to roots. We suggest that phosphoethanolamine hydrolysis by AtPECP1 during Pi starvation is required to down-regulate the -consuming biosynthesis of phosphocholine through the methylation pathway.© The Author(s) 2017.

However, only limited body weight reductions are achieved with SGLT2i administration. Hyperphagia is reportedly one of the causes of this limited weight loss. However, the effects of SGLT2i on systemic  expenditure have not been fully elucidated. We investigated the acute effects of dapagliflozin, an SGLT2i, on systemic  expenditure in mice. Eighteen hours after dapagliflozin administration, oxygen consumption and brown adipose tissue (BAT) expression of ucp1, a thermogenesis-related gene, were significantly decreased as compared with those after vehicle administration. In addition, dapagliflozin significantly suppressed norepinephrine (NE) turnover in BAT and c-fos expression in the rostral raphe pallidus nucleus (rRPa), which contains the sympathetic premotor neurons responsible for thermogenesis. These findings indicate that the dapagliflozin-mediated acute decrease in  expenditure involves a reduction in BAT thermogenesis via decreased sympathetic nerve activity from the rRPa. Furthermore, common hepatic branch vagotomy abolished the reductions in ucp1 expression, NE contents in BAT, and c-fos expression in the rRPa. In addition, alterations in hepatic carbohydrate metabolism, such as decreases in glycogen contents and upregulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, occurred prior to the suppression of BAT thermogenesis, e.g., 6 h after dapagliflozin treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that SGLT2i acutely suppresses  expenditure in BAT via regulation of an interorgan neural network consisting of the common hepatic vagal branch and sympathetic nerves.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28634884>A Nanosensor Based on Carbon Dots for Recovered Fluorescence Detection Clenbuterol in Pork Samples.</a></h1><p>Clenbuterol (CLB), a member of β-agonist family, has now been a serious threat to human health due to its illegal usage in the animal feed. In this paper, we designed a fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET) system consisting of carbon dots (C-dots) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for recovered fluorescence detecting of CLB. In the presence of CLB, CLB molecules can interact with AuNPs via Au-N bonds, preventing the interaction of C-dots and AuNPs, which induced the recover of the fluorescent intensity. Under the optimal conditions, the limit of detection for CLB was 3 nM, with a wide concentration linear range of 8-200 nM (S/N = 3).

To determine the role of the eut system in C. perfringens growth, an in-frame deletion of the eutABC genes was made in strain HN13 to generate the eutABC-deleted mutant strain HY1701. Comparison of HN13 and HY1701 growth in media supplemented with 1.0% glucose and/or 1.0% EA showed that glucose enhanced the growth of both strains, whereas EA enhanced HN13 growth, but not that of HY1701, indicating that the eut system is necessary for C. perfringens to utilize EA. The two-component regulatory system EutVW is needed to induce eut gene expression in response to EA whereas the global virulence regulator VirRS differentially controlled eut gene expression depending on glucose and EA availability. To assess the role of the eut system in vivo, an equal number of HN13 and HY1701 cells were injected into the right thigh muscles of mice. Mice infected with HY1701 showed fewer symptoms than those injected with HN13. The mortality rate of mice infected with HY1701 tended to be lower than for mice infected with HN13. In addition, in infected tissues from mice injected with a mixture of HN13 and HY1701, HN13 outnumbered HY1701. PCR screening demonstrated that C. perfringens isolated from gas gangrene and sporadic diarrhea cases carried both eut genes and the perfringolysin O gene (pfoA) as well as the phospholipase C gene (plc). However, pfoA was not detected in isolates from food poisoning patients and healthy volunteers. Culture supernatants prepared from HN13 grown in media containing 7.5% sheep red blood cells induced significantly higher eutB expression levels compared to those from plc- and/or pfoA-deletion mutants. Together, these results indicate that the eut system plays a nutritional role for C. perfringens during histolytic infection.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Isoproterenol (ISO) administration induced the myocardial injury as evidenced by the altered ECG pattern with ST-segment elevation and an increase in the levels of cardiac injury markers including troponin-I, creatine kinase-MB, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase; inflammatory markers, interleukine-6 and tumor necrosis factor. In this group, there was also an increase in cardiac lipid peroxidation and a decrease in cellular antioxidants. However, pretreatment with ACC maintained the normal ECG pattern and nearly normal levels of all the cardiac markers in ISO-induced animals. Electron microscopic and histological studies also showed marked reduction in ISO-induced cardiac damages including infarct size by ACC.

However, the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis in kwashiorkor is uncertain. Our objective was to develop a mouse model of childhood undernutrition in order to test the hypothesis that feeding a maize vegetable diet (MVD), like that consumed by children at risk for kwashiorkor, will cause hepatic steatosis which is prevented by supplementation with choline. A MVD was developed with locally sourced organic ingredients, and fed to weanling mice ( = 9) for 6 or 13 days. An additional group of mice ( = 4) were fed a choline supplemented MVD. Weight, body composition, and liver changes were compared to control mice ( = 10) at the beginning and end of the study. The MVD resulted in reduced weight gain and hepatic steatosis. Choline supplementation prevented hepatic steatosis and was associated with increased hepatic concentrations of the methyl donor betaine. Our findings show that (1) feeding a MVD to weanling mice rapidly induces hepatic steatosis, which is a hallmark disturbance of kwashiorkor; and that (2) hepatic steatosis associated with feeding a MVD is prevented by choline supplementation. These findings support the concept that insufficient choline intake may contribute to the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis in kwashiorkor.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30101351>Dietary intake of one-carbon metabolism nutrients and DNA methylation in peripheral blood.</a></h1><p>Folate and other one-carbon metabolism nutrients are essential to enable DNA methylation to occur, but the extent to which their dietary intake influences methylation in adulthood is unclear.We assessed associations between dietary intake of these nutrients and DNA methylation in peripheral blood, overall and at specific genomic locations.We conducted a cross-sectional study using baseline data and samples from 5186 adult participants in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS). Nutrient intake was estimated from a food-frequency questionnaire. DNA methylation was measured by using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array (HM450K). We assessed associations of intakes of folate, riboflavin, vitamins B-6 and B-12, methionine, choline, and betaine with methylation at individual cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs), and with median (genome-wide) methylation across all CpGs, CpGs in gene bodies, and CpGs in gene promoters. We also assessed associations with methylation at long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1), satellite 2 (Sat2), and Arthrobacter luteus restriction endonuclease (Alu) repetitive elements for a subset of participants. We used linear mixed regression, adjusting for age, sex, country of birth, smoking,  intake from food, alcohol intake, Mediterranean diet score, and batch effects to assess log-linear associations with dietary intake of each nutrient. In secondary analyses, we assessed associations with low or high intakes defined by extreme quintiles.No evidence of log-linear association was observed at P < 10-7 between the intake of one-carbon metabolism nutrients and methylation at individual CpGs. Low intake of riboflavin was associated with higher methylation at CpG cg21230392 in the first exon of PROM1 (P = 5.0 × 10-8). No consistent evidence of association was observed with genome-wide or repetitive element measures of methylation.Our findings suggest that dietary intake of one-carbon metabolism nutrients in adulthood, as measured by a food-frequency questionnaire, has little association with blood DNA methylation. An association with low intake of riboflavin requires replication in independent cohorts.

Besides providing nutrients to the infant, human milk also contains metabolites which form an intricate system between maternal lifestyle, such as the mother's diet and the gut microbiome, and infant outcomes. This study investigates the variation of these human milk metabolites from five different countries. Human milk samples ( = 109) were collected one month postpartum from Australia, Japan, the USA, Norway, and South Africa and were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance. The partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) showed separation between either maternal countries of origin or ethnicities. Variation between countries in concentration of metabolites, such as 2-oxoglutarate, creatine, and glutamine, in human milk, between countries, could provide insights into problems, such as mastitis and/or impaired functions of the mammary glands. Several important markers of milk production, such as lactose, betaine, creatine, glutamate, and glutamine, showed good correlation between each metabolite. This work highlights the importance of milk metabolites with respect to maternal lifestyle and the environment, and also provides the framework for future breastfeeding and microbiome studies in a global context.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30463326>Hydrogen Production from  Poplar Preceded by MEA Pre-Treatment and Enzymatic Hydrolysis.</a></h1><p>The need to pre-treat lignocellulosic biomass prior to dark fermentation results primarily from the composition of lignocellulose because lignin hinders the processing of hard wood towards useful products. Hence, in this work a two-step approach for the pre-treatment of  poplar, including alkaline pre-treatment and enzymatic saccharification followed by fermentation has been studied. Monoethanolamine (MEA) was used as the alkaline catalyst and diatomite immobilized bed enzymes were used during saccharification. The response surface methodology (RSM) method was used to determine the optimal alkaline pre-treatment conditions resulting in the highest values of both total released sugars (TRS) yield and degree of lignin removal. Three variable parameters (temperature, MEA concentration, time) were selected to optimize the alkaline pre-treatment conditions. The research was carried out using the Box-Behnken design. Additionally, the possibility of the re-use of both alkaline as well as enzymatic reagents was investigated. Obtained hydrolysates were subjected to dark fermentation in batch reactors performed by  with a final result of 22.99 mL H₂/g  poplar (0.6 mol H₂/mol TRS).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29183191>Mechanisms governing the fragmentation of glycerophospholipids containing choline and  polar head groups.</a></h1><p>Glycerophospholipids are the major amphiphilic molecules found in the plasma membrane bilayer of all vertebrate cells. Involved in many biological processes, their huge structural diversity and large concentration scale make their thorough characterization extremely difficult in complex biological matrices. Mass spectrometry techniques are now recognized as being among the most powerful methods for the sensitive and comprehensive characterization of lipids. Depending on the experimental conditions used during electrospray ionization mass spectrometry experiments, glycerophospholipids can be detected as different molecular species (e.g. protonated, sodiated species) when analyzed either in positive or negative ionization modes or by direct introduction or hyphenated mass spectrometry-based methods. The observed ionized forms are characteristic of the corresponding phospholipid structures, and their formation is highly influenced by the polar head group. Although the fragmentation behavior of each phospholipid class has already been widely studied under low collision , there are no established rules based on charge-induced dissociation mechanisms for explaining the generation of fragment ions. In the present paper, we emphasize the crucial roles played by ion-dipole complexes and salt bridges within charge-induced dissociation processes. Under these conditions, we were able to readily explain almost all the fragment ions obtained under low- collision-induced dissociation for particular glycerophospholipids and lysoglycerophospholipids species including glycerophosphatidylcholines and glycerophosphatidylethanolamines. Thus, in addition to providing a basis for a better comprehension of phospholipid fragmentation processes, our work also highlighted some potentially new relevant diagnostic ions to signal the presence of particular lipid species.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28213613>ATF4/ATG5 Signaling in Hypothalamic Proopiomelanocortin Neurons Regulates Fat Mass via Affecting  Expenditure.</a></h1><p>Although many biological functions of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) have been identified, a role of hypothalamic ATF4 in the regulation of  homeostasis is poorly understood. In this study, we showed that hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neuron-specific ATF4 knockout (PAKO) mice are lean and have higher  expenditure. Furthermore, PAKO mice were resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity, glucose intolerance, and leptin resistance. Moreover, the expression of autophagy protein 5 (ATG5) was increased or decreased by ATF4 knockdown or overexpression, respectively, and ATF4 inhibited the transcription of ATG5 by binding to the basic zipper-containing protein sites on its promoter. Importantly, mice with double knockout of ATF4 and ATG5 in POMC neurons gained more fat mass and reduced  expenditure compared with PAKO mice under a high-fat diet. Finally, the effect of ATF4 deletion in POMC neurons was possibly mediated via enhanced ATG5-dependent autophagy and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone production in the hypothalamus. Taken together, these results identify the beneficial role of hypothalamic ATF4/ATG5 axis in the regulation of  expenditure, obesity, and obesity-related metabolic disorders, which suggests that ATF4/ATG5 axis in the hypothalamus may be a new potential therapeutic target for treating obesity and obesity-related metabolic diseases.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30126894>Transient Overexpression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A in Adipose Tissue Promotes  Expenditure via Activation of the Sympathetic Nervous System.</a></h1><p>Adipose-derived vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) stimulates functional blood vessel formation in obese fat pads, which in turn facilitates healthy expansion of the adipose tissue. However, the detailed mechanism(s) governing the process remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of sympathetic nervous system activation in the process. To this end, we induced overexpression of VEGF-A in an adipose tissue-specific doxycycline (Dox)-inducible transgenic mouse model for a short period of time during high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. We found that local overexpression of VEGF-A in adipose tissue stimulated lipolysis and browning rapidly after Dox induction. Immunofluorescence staining against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) indicated higher levels of sympathetic innervation in adipose tissue of transgenic mice. In response to an increased norepinephrine (NE) level, expression of β3-adrenoceptor was significantly upregulated, and the downstream protein kinase A (PKA) pathway was activated, as indicated by enhanced phosphorylation of whole PKA substrates, in particular, the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in adipocytes. As a result, the adipose tissue exhibited increased lipolysis, browning, and  expenditure. Importantly, all of these effects were abolished upon treatment with the β3-adrenoceptor antagonist SR59230A. Collectively, these results demonstrate that transient overexpressed VEGF-A activates the sympathetic nervous system, which hence promotes lipolysis and browning in adipose tissue.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29779845>Effects of estradiol on lactoprivic signaling of the hindbrain upon the contraregulatory hormonal response and metabolic neuropeptide synthesis in hypoglycemic female rats.</a></h1><p>Caudal dorsomedial hindbrain detection of hypoglycemia-associated lactoprivation regulates glucose counter-regulation in male rats. In females, estradiol (E) determines hypothalamic neuroanatomical and molecular foci of hindbrain  sensor activation. This study investigated the hypothesis that E signal strength governs metabolic neuropeptide and counter-regulatory hormone responses to hindbrain lactoprivic stimuli in hypoglycemic female rats.Ovariectomized animals were implanted with E-filled silastic capsules [30 (E-30) or 300 μg (E-300)/mL] to replicate plasma concentrations at estrous cycle nadir versus peak levels. E-30 and E-300 rats were injected with insulin or vehicle following initiation of continuous caudal fourth ventricular L-lactate infusion.Hypoglycemic hypercorticosteronemia was greater in E-30 versus E-300 animals. Glucagon and corticosterone outflow was correspondingly fully or partially reversed by hindbrain lactate infusion. Insulin-injected rats exhibited lactate-reversible augmentation of norepinephrine (NE) accumulation in all preoptic/hypothalamic structures examined, excluding the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) where hindbrain lactate infusion either suppressed (E-30) or enhanced (E-300) NE content. Expression profiles of hypoglycemia-reactive metabolic neuropeptides were normalized (with greater efficacy in E-300 animals) by lactate infusion. DMH RFamide-related peptide-1 and -3, arcuate neuropeptide Y and kisspeptin, and ventromedial nucleus nitric oxide synthase protein responses to hypoglycemia were E dosage-dependent.Distinct physiological patterns of E secretion characteristic of the female rat estrous cycle elicit differential corticosterone outflow during hypoglycemia, and establish both common and different hypothalamic metabolic neurotransmitter targets of hindbrain lactate deficit signaling. Outcomes emphasize a need for insight on systems-level organization, interaction, and involvement of E signal strength-sensitive neuropeptides in counter-regulatory functions.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Differences in the function of brain reward circuits, including in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), have been shown in obesity-prone vs. obesity-resistant populations, leading many researchers to explore the role of striatal dopamine in obesity. However, alterations in NE transmission also affect NAc mediated behaviors. Therefore, here we examined differences in striatal NE and the response to norepinephrine transporter blockers in obesity-prone and obesity-resistant rats. We found that striatal NE levels increase following systemic cocaine administration in obesity-prone, but not obesity-resistant rats. This could result from either blockade of striatal norepinephrine transporters (NET) by cocaine leading to reduced NE reuptake, or circuit-based responses following cocaine administration resulting in increased NE release. Retrodialysis of the NET inhibitor, desipramine, into the ventral striatum did not cause selective increases in striatal NE levels in obesity-prone rats, suggesting that circuit-based mechanisms underlie NE increases following systemic cocaine administration. Consistent with this, systemic desipramine treatment decreased locomotor activity in obesity-prone, but not obesity-resistant rats. Furthermore, obesity-prone rats were also more sensitive to desipramine-induced reductions in food intake compared to obesity-resistant rats. Taken together, these data expand our understanding of differences in NE systems of obesity-prone vs. resistant rats, and provide new insights into basal differences in striatal systems that may influence feeding behavior.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although previous studies report NE clearance mechanisms via SLC6A2 on sympathetic neurons or proinflammatory macrophages in adipose tissues (ATs), the low catecholamine clearance capacity of SLC6A2 may limit the cleaning efficiency. Here, we report that mouse organic cation transporter 3 (Oct3; Slc22a3) is highly expressed in WAT and displays the greatest uptake rate of NE as a selective non-neural route of NE clearance in white adipocytes, which differs from other known routes such as adjacent neurons or macrophages. We further show that adipocytes express high levels of NE degradation enzymes Maoa, Maob, and Comt, providing the molecular basis on NE clearance by adipocytes together with its reuptake transporter Oct3. Under NE administration, ablation of Oct3 induces higher body temperature, thermogenesis, and lipolysis compared with littermate controls. After prolonged cold challenge, inguinal WAT (ingWAT) in adipose-specific Oct3-deficient mice shows much stronger browning characteristics and significantly elevated expression of thermogenic and mitochondrial biogenesis genes than in littermate controls, and this response involves enhanced β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR)/protein kinase A (PKA)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive element binding protein (Creb) pathway activation. Glycolytic genes are reprogrammed to significantly higher levels to compensate for the loss of ATP production in adipose-specific Oct3 knockout (KO) mice, indicating the fundamental role of glucose metabolism during beiging. Inhibition of β-AR largely abolishes the higher lipolytic and thermogenic activities in Oct3-deficient ingWAT, indicating the NE overload in the vicinity of adipocytes in Oct3 KO adipocytes. Of note, reduced functional alleles in human OCT3 are also identified to be associated with increased basal metabolic rate (BMR). Collectively, our results demonstrate that Oct3 governs β-AR activity as a NE recycling transporter in white adipocytes, offering potential therapeutic applications for metabolic disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28459435>Brown-adipose-tissue macrophages control tissue innervation and homeostatic  expenditure.</a></h1><p>Tissue macrophages provide immunological defense and contribute to the establishment and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Here we used constitutive and inducible mutagenesis to delete the nuclear transcription regulator Mecp2 in macrophages. Mice that lacked the gene encoding Mecp2, which is associated with Rett syndrome, in macrophages did not show signs of neurodevelopmental disorder but displayed spontaneous obesity, which was linked to impaired function of brown adipose tissue (BAT). Specifically, mutagenesis of a BAT-resident CxCr1 macrophage subpopulation compromised homeostatic thermogenesis but not acute, cold-induced thermogenesis. Mechanistically, malfunction of BAT in pre-obese mice with mutant macrophages was associated with diminished sympathetic innervation and local titers of norepinephrine, which resulted in lower expression of thermogenic factors by adipocytes. Mutant macrophages overexpressed the signaling receptor and ligand PlexinA4, which might contribute to the phenotype by repulsion of sympathetic axons expressing the transmembrane semaphorin Sema6A. Collectively, we report a previously unappreciated homeostatic role for macrophages in the control of tissue innervation. Disruption of this circuit in BAT resulted in metabolic imbalance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29032410>Relationship Between Circulating Fatty Acids and Fatty Acid Ethanolamide Levels After a Single 2-h Dietary Fat Feeding in Male Sprague-Dawley Rats : Elevated levels of oleoylethanolamide, palmitoylethanolamide, linoleoylethanolamide, arachidonoylethanolamide and docosahexanoylethanolamide after a single 2 h dietary fat feeding in male Sprague Dawley rats.</a></h1><p>Previous studies show that long term variations in dietary fat consumption impact circulating fatty acid ethanolamide (FAE) concentrations, however, few studies have investigated short term effects of dietary fat feeding on FAE levels. The trial's objective was to explore the effect of acute feeding of varying amounts of dietary n-9 and n-3 fatty acids on plasma and organ levels of FAE. Sixty-four rats were assigned to four groups fed meals containing 40% of  as either safflower oil (control), canola oil (CO), or DHA rich oil (DRO), each consumed as a bolus within a 2-h window. Plasma and tissue FAE levels were measured at 3, 6, 12 and 24 h following the bolus. FAE profiles over time exhibited patterns that were specific both to FAE and to dietary fat type provided. At 3 h, plasma and liver OEA levels were higher (p < 0.05) in the 95% CO:5% DRO compared with other groups. At 12 h, plasma PEA levels were lower (p < 0.05) in the 50% CO:50% DRO group compared to the 95% CO group. Plasma DEA levels showed an increase (p < 0.05) only after 24 h of feeding. All four dietary groups manifested increased DEA levels in a dose-dependent manner. Data demonstrate that a single meal feeding of diets with different ratios of fat types impacts tissue levels of FAE within a short time frame, which could further influence the physiological roles of FAE on appetite regulation and  expenditure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28367972>A brain-sparing diphtheria toxin for chemical genetic ablation of peripheral cell lineages.</a></h1><p>Conditional expression of diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) is widely used for tissue-specific ablation of cells. However, diphtheria toxin (DT) crosses the blood-brain barrier, which limits its utility for ablating peripheral cells using Cre drivers that are also expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). Here we report the development of a brain-sparing DT, termed BRAINSPAReDT, for tissue-specific genetic ablation of cells outside the CNS. We prevent blood-brain barrier passage of DT through PEGylation, which polarizes the molecule and increases its size. We validate BRAINSPAReDT with regional genetic sympathectomy: BRAINSPAReDT ablates peripheral but not central catecholaminergic neurons, thus avoiding the Parkinson-like phenotype associated with full dopaminergic depletion. Regional sympathectomy compromises adipose tissue thermogenesis, and renders mice susceptible to obesity. We provide a proof of principle that BRAINSPAReDT can be used for Cre/DTR tissue-specific ablation outside the brain using CNS drivers, while consolidating the link between adiposity and the sympathetic nervous system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30352567>Transcriptomic analysis reveals specific metabolic pathways of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 in bovine digestive contents.</a></h1><p>The cattle gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is the main enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) reservoir. In order to identify nutrients required for the survival or multiplication of EHEC in the bovine GIT, we compared the transcriptomes of the EHEC O157:H7 reference strain EDL933 cultured in vitro in bovine digestive contents (DCs) (rumen, small intestine and rectum) using RNA-sequencing.Gene expression profiles showed that EHEC EDL933 activated common but also specific metabolic pathways to survive in the different bovine DCs. Mucus-derived carbohydrates seem important in EHEC nutrition in posterior DCs (small intestine and rectum) but not in rumen content. Additional carbohydrates (xylose, ribose, mannitol, galactitol) as well as gluconeogenic substrates (aspartate, serine, glycerol) would also be used by EHEC as carbon and/or nitrogen sources all along the bovine GIT including the rumen. However, xylose, GalNac, ribose and fucose transport and/or assimilation encoding genes were over-expressed during incubation in rectum content compared with rumen and intestine contents, and genes coding for maltose transport were only induced in rectum. This suggests a role for these carbohydrates in the colonization of the cattle rectum, considered as the major site for EHEC multiplication. In contrast, the transcription of the genes associated with the assimilation of , an important nitrogen source for EHEC, was poorly induced in EHEC growing in rectum content, suggesting that  is mainly assimilated in the cattle rumen and small intestine. Respiratory flexibility would also be required for EHEC survival because of the redundancy of dehydrogenases and reductases simultaneously induced in the bovine DCs, probably in response to the availability of electron donors and acceptors.EHEC EDL933 showed a high flexibility in the activation of genes involved in respiratory pathways and assimilation of carbon and nitrogen sources, most of them from animal origin. This may allow the bacterium to adapt and survive in the various bovine GIT compartments. Obtaining a better understanding of EHEC physiology in bovine GIT is a key step to ultimately propose strategies to limit EHEC carriage and shedding by cattle.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29382341>Stress-induced reproductive arrest in Drosophila occurs through ETH deficiency-mediated suppression of oogenesis and ovulation.</a></h1><p>Environmental stressors induce changes in endocrine state, leading to  re-allocation from reproduction to survival. Female Drosophila melanogaster respond to thermal and nutrient stressors by arresting egg production through elevation of the steroid hormone ecdysone. However, the mechanisms through which this reproductive arrest occurs are not well understood.Here we report that stress-induced elevation of ecdysone is accompanied by decreased levels of ecdysis triggering hormone (ETH). Depressed levels of circulating ETH lead to attenuated activity of its targets, including juvenile hormone-producing corpus allatum and, as we describe here for the first time, octopaminergic neurons of the oviduct. Elevation of steroid thereby results in arrested oogenesis, reduced octopaminergic input to the reproductive tract, and consequent suppression of ovulation. ETH mitigates heat or nutritional stress-induced attenuation of fecundity, which suggests that its deficiency is critical to reproductive adaptability.Our findings indicate that, as a dual regulator of octopamine and juvenile hormone release, ETH provides a link between stress-induced elevation of ecdysone levels and consequent reduction in fecundity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30767501>Photolytic Cleavage of Co-C Bond in Coenzyme B-Dependent Glutamate Mutase.</a></h1><p>Glutamate mutase (GLM) is a coenzyme B-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of S-glutamate to (2 S,3 S)-3-methyl aspartate. The initial step in the catalytic process is the homolytic cleavage of the coenzyme's Co-C bond upon binding of a substrate. Alternatively, the Co-C bond can be cleaved using light. To investigate the photolytic cleavage of the Co-C bond in GLM, we applied a combined density functional theory/molecular mechanics (DFT/MM) and time-dependent-DFT/MM method to scrutinize the ground and the low-lying excited states. Potential  surfaces (PESs) were generated as a function of axial bond lengths to describe the photodissociation mechanism. The S PES was characterized as the crossing of two electronic states, metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT), and ligand field (LF). In GLM, radical pairs generate from the LF state. Two pathways, path A and path B, were identified as possible channels to connect the MLCT and LF electronic states. The S PES in GLM was compared with the S PES for coenzyme B-dependent  ammonia lyase as well as the isolated AdoCbl cofactor.

Our hypothesis was that these responses could change according to genotype (breed) and body fatness. Six fat, nonpregnant, nonlactating Charolais cows, six fat Holstein cows, and six lean Holstein cows were used in a 2 × 2 crossover design with two treatments (underfeeding or overfeeding, at 62% [low] or 128% [high] of maintenance  requirements [MER], respectively) and two periods. Isoproterenol (ISO, a nonselective β-adrenergic agonist) or epinephrine (EPI, a β- and α2-adrenergic agonist) was injected (6 nmol/kg of lean mass). Blood samples were collected regularly from -20 to 75 min after the injection and then were analyzed for NEFA, glycerol, glucose, and L-lactate. Underfeeding greatly increased (P < 0.001) basal plasma NEFA concentrations (+467%, +264%, and +600% for fat Charolais, fat Holstein, and lean Holstein cows, respectively). For each drug, underfed cows had higher NEFA or glycerol responses to adrenergic challenges than overfed cows. Fat Charolais cows had higher basal plasma NEFA (P < 0.05) concentrations (+64.9%) than fat Holstein cows. The plasma NEFA or glycerol response at 5 min (P < 0.05) was higher for fat Charolais than for fat Holstein cows, whatever the injected drug. Basal plasma lactate concentration and lactate response to ISO or EPI were higher (P < 0.05) for fat Charolais cows than for fat Holstein cows. Fat Holstein cows had higher (P < 0.01) basal glycerol (+18.4%) than lean Holstein cows. This increase could be linked to the increased AT mass. ISO increased more lipolytic responses in fat than in lean Holstein cows, whereas EPI increased more these responses in lean than in fat Holstein cows (drug × fatness interaction), suggesting an increased antilipolytic effect due to α2-AR stimulation in fat cows. Breed had a significant effect on basal and stimulated fat mobilization as well as lactate concentrations, suggesting that the Charolais breed could be more sensitive to stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28956602>Structural and Functional Characterization of a Short-Chain Flavodoxin Associated with a Noncanonical 1,2-Propanediol Utilization Bacterial Microcompartment.</a></h1><p>Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are proteinaceous organelles that encapsulate enzymes involved in CO fixation (carboxysomes) or carbon catabolism (metabolosomes). Metabolosomes share a common core of enzymes and a distinct signature enzyme for substrate degradation that defines the function of the BMC (e.g., propanediol or  utilization BMCs, or glycyl-radical enzyme microcompartments). Loci encoding metabolosomes also typically contain genes for proteins that support organelle function, such as regulation, transport of substrate, and cofactor (e.g., vitamin B) synthesis and recycling. Flavoproteins are frequently among these ancillary gene products, suggesting that these redox active proteins play an undetermined function in many metabolosomes. Here, we report the first characterization of a BMC-associated flavodoxin (Fld1C), a small flavoprotein, derived from the noncanonical 1,2-propanediol utilization BMC locus (PDU1C) of Lactobacillus reuteri. The 2.0 Å X-ray structure of Fld1C displays the α/β flavodoxin fold, which noncovalently binds a single flavin mononucleotide molecule. Fld1C is a short-chain flavodoxin with redox potentials of -240 ± 3 mV oxidized/semiquinone and -344 ± 1 mV semiquinone/hydroquinone versus the standard hydrogen electrode at pH 7.5. It can participate in an electron transfer reaction with a photoreductant to form a stable semiquinone species. Collectively, our structural and functional results suggest that PDU1C BMCs encapsulate Fld1C to store and transfer electrons for the reactivation and/or recycling of the B cofactor utilized by the signature enzyme.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29733972>Application of an inline dry powder inhaler to deliver high dose pharmaceutical aerosols during low flow nasal cannula therapy.</a></h1><p>Inline dry powder inhalers (DPIs) offer a potentially effective option to deliver high dose inhaled medications simultaneously with mechanical ventilation. The objective of this study was to develop an inline DPI that is actuated using a low volume of air (LV-DPI) to efficiently deliver pharmaceutical aerosols during low flow nasal cannula (LFNC) therapy. A characteristic feature of the new inline LV-DPIs was the use of hollow capillary tubes that both pierced the capsule and provided a pathway for inlet air and exiting aerosol. Aerosolization characteristics, LFNC depositional losses and emitted dose (ED) were determined using 10 mg powder masses of a small-particle excipient enhanced growth (EEG) formulation. While increasing the number of inlet capillaries from one to three did not improve performance, retracting the inlet and outlet capillaries did improve ED by over 30%. It was theorized that high quality performance requires both high turbulent  to deaggregate the powder and high wall shear stresses to minimize capsule retention. Best case performance included a device ED of approximately 85% (of loaded dose) and device emitted mass median aerodynamic diameter of 1.77 µm. Maximum ED through the LFNC system and small diameter (4 mm) nasal cannula was approximately 65% of the loaded dose. Potential applications of this device include the delivery of high dose inhaled medications such as surfactants, antibiotics, mucolytics, and anti-inflammatories.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here, using single-molecule fluorescence resonance  transfer imaging, we examine TM6 movements in the β adrenergic receptor (βAR) upon exposure to orthosteric ligands with different efficacies, in the absence and presence of the G heterotrimer. We show that partial and full agonists differentially affect TM6 motions to regulate the rate at which GDP-bound βAR-G complexes are formed and the efficiency of nucleotide exchange leading to G activation. These data also reveal transient nucleotide-bound βAR-G species that are distinct from known structures, and provide single-molecule perspectives on the allosteric link between ligand- and nucleotide-binding pockets that shed new light on the G-protein activation mechanism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29845147>Dietary fatty acid composition impacts plasma fatty acid ethanolamide levels and body composition in golden Syrian hamsters.</a></h1><p>Fatty acid ethanolamides (FAEs) are a class of lipid amides that regulate numerous pathophysiological functions. To date, pharmacological research in this area has focused on the endocannabinoid system, metabolic pathways, and biological significance of FAEs; however, limited nutritional studies have been conducted to understand the actions of FAEs on food intake and their role on overall body composition. Therefore, the present study was designed with the hypothesis that high C18:1n9 will attenuate food consumption in golden Syrian male hamsters (n = 105). Moreover, the long-term (two months) effects of feeding hamsters various dietary oil blends, namely, C+S, 25:75 corn oil:n9 safflower oil; F+S, 25:75 flaxseed oil:n6 safflower oil; H+DHA, 85:15 high oleic canola oil:docosahexaenoic acid; H+EPA, 85:15 high oleic canola oil:eicosapentaenoic acid; HOCO, high oleic canola oil; OO, olive oil; and RC, regular canola oil, on the plasma levels of seven different FAEs and fatty acids (FAs) composition were investigated. A further objective was to characterize the actions of these diets on  expenditure and overall body composition to determine if dietary fatty acid (DFA) composition affects diet-induced obesity (DIO). The results show that DFA directly influenced plasma FA and FAE levels, with marked increases (p < 0.05) observed in plasma C18:1n9 levels after HOCO and OO treatments. Correspondingly, the most elevated plasma oleoylethanolamide (OEA) levels were observed with HOCO and OO treatments, which also decreased (p < 0.05) food intake by ∼8% when compared with H+EPA dietary treatment when measured at the endpoint. Diminished food intake subsequent to HOCO and OO feeding may have resulted from increased OEA concentrations, demonstrating the anorexic properties of the high C18:1n9 dietary components. No differences were observed across OO, HOCO, and HOCO diets with omega-3 FA blends in terms of body composition,  expenditure, plasma C18:1n9 levels, or OEA concentrations. Based on these findings, we conclude that the addition of HOCO to diets aids in the reduction of food intake, which may contribute to the maintenance of healthy body weight.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28836294>How fast monoamine oxidases decompose adrenaline? Kinetics of isoenzymes A and B evaluated by empirical valence bond simulation.</a></h1><p>This work scrutinizes kinetics of decomposition of adrenaline catalyzed by monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B enzymes, a process controlling the levels of adrenaline in the central nervous system and other tissues. Experimental kinetic data for MAO A and B catalyzed decomposition of adrenaline are reported only in the form of the maximum reaction rate. Therefore, we estimated the experimental free  barriers form the kinetic data of closely related systems using regression method, as was done in our previous study. By using multiscale simulation on the Empirical Valence Bond (EVB) level, we studied the chemical reactivity of the MAO A catalyzed decomposition of adrenaline and we obtained a value of activation free  of 17.3 ± 0.4 kcal/mol. The corresponding value for MAO B is 15.7 ± 0.7 kcal/mol. Both values are in good agreement with the estimated experimental barriers of 16.6 and 16.0 kcal/mol for MAO A and MAO B, respectively. The fact that we reproduced the kinetic data and preferential catalytic effect of MAO B over MAO A gives additional support to the validity of the proposed hydride transfer mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adrenaline is preferably involved in the reaction in a neutral rather than in a protonated form due to considerably higher barriers computed for the protonated adrenaline substrate. The results are discussed in the context of chemical mechanism of MAO enzymes and possible applications of multiscale simulation to rationalize the effects of MAO activity on adrenaline level.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28844165>Really does temperature reduction and norepinephrine have similar effects on the  metabolism in rat brown adipose tissue?</a></h1><p>Heat generation by brown adipose tissue (BAT) in response to temperature reduction seems to be entirely related to sympathetic nervous stimulation.To analyse if temperature reduction and norepinephrine may differently affect the expression of proteins related to  metabolism in BAT.Isolated rats BAT was incubated with/without norepinephrine (10 mol/L, 24 h at 32 °C and 37 °C).In BAT, 32 °C increased the protein expression levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I and -II, mitochondrial uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) and the expression and activity of lactate dehydrogenase. Mitochondrial F-ATP synthase α-chain expression was decreased at 32 °C compared to 37 °C. Norepinephrine and at 32 °C exposure, UCP-1 expression was increased but cytochrome-c oxidase and F-ATP synthase α-chain expression was reduced with respect to 37 °C.Sympathetic stimulation seems not to be the only factor associated with heat generation.Temperature reduction by itself exerts some different effects on the expression of proteins related to the  metabolism than norepinephrine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30273351>Beta-adrenergic activation induces cardiac collapse by aggravating cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction in bupivacaine intoxication.</a></h1><p>In order to determine the role of the adrenergic system in bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity, a series of experiments were performed. In an animal experiment, male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats under chloral hydrate anesthesia received intravenous bupivacaine, followed by an intravenous injection of adrenalin or isoprenalin, and the electrocardiogram (ECG), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), the maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (+dP/dtmax) and the maximum rate of pressure decrease (-dP/dtmax) were continually monitored. In a cellular experiment, freshly isolated adult SD rat ventricular myocytes were perfused with bupivacaine at different concentrations in the presence or absence of isoprenalin, with or without esmolol. The percentage of the sarcomere shortening (bl% peak h), departure velocity (dep v) of sarcomere shortening and time to 50% of the peak speed of myocyte contraction (Tp50) was assessed by a video-based edge-detection system. In an additional experiment, Swiss mice pretreated with saline, isoprenalin, esmolol or dexmedetomidine received bupivacaine to determine the 50% lethal dose (LD50) of bupivacaine. Electron microscopy of myocardial mitochondria was performed to assess damage of these structures. To test mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, freshly isolated SD rat ventricular myocytes were incubated with bupivacaine in the presence of isoprenalin, with or without esmolol. First, our results showed that bupivacaine significantly reduced the LVSP and +dP/dtmax, as well as enhanced the LVEDP and -dP/dtmax (P < 0.05, vs. control, and vs. baseline). Adrenalin and isoprenalin induced a further reduction of LVSP and +dP/dtmax (P < 0.05, vs. before adrenalin or isoprenalin delivery, and vs. control). Second, bupivacaine induced a dose-dependent cardiomyocyte contractile depression. While 5.9 μmol/L or 8.9 μmol/L of bupivacaine resulted in no change, 30.0 μmol/L of bupivacaine prolonged the Tp50 and reduced the bl% peak h and dep v (P < 0.05, vs. control and vs. baseline). Isoprenalin aggravated the bupivacaine-induced cardiomyocyte contractile depression, significantly prolonging the Tp50 (P < 0.05, vs. bupivacaine alone) and reducing the dep v (P < 0.05, vs. bupivacaine alone). Third, esmolol and dexmedetomidine significantly enhanced, while isoprenalin significantly reduced, the LD50 of bupivacaine in mice. Fourth, bupivacaine led to significant mitochondrial swelling, and the extent of myocardial mitochondrial swelling in isoprenalin-pretreated mice was significantly higher than that compared with mice pretreated with saline, as reflected by the higher mitochondrial damage score (P < 0.01). Meanwhile, esmolol pretreatment significantly reduced the mitochondrial damage score (P < 0.01). Fifth, bupivacaine significantly increased the ROS in freshly isolated cardiomyocytes, and added isoprenalin induced a further enhancement of ROS production (P < 0.05, vs. bupivacaine alone). Added esmolol significantly decreased ROS production (P < 0.05, vs. bupivacaine + isoprenalin). Our results suggest that bupivacaine depressed cardiac automaticity, conductivity and contractility, but the predominant effect was contractile dysfunction which resulted from the disruption of mitochondrial  metabolism. β-adrenergic activation aggravated the cellular metabolism disorder and therefore contractile dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29305401>Changes in Gut Microbiota-Related Metabolites and Long-term Successful Weight Loss in Response to Weight-Loss Diets: The POUNDS Lost Trial.</a></h1><p>Adiposity and the gut microbiota are both related to the risk of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to comprehensively examine how changes induced by a weight-loss diet intervention in gut microbiota-related metabolites, such as trimethylamine -oxide (TMAO) and its precursors (choline and l-carnitine), were associated with improvements in adiposity and regional fat deposition.This study included 510 overweight and obese individuals who were randomly assigned one of four diets varying in macronutrient intake. We examined associations of 6-month changes in blood metabolites (TMAO, choline, and l-carnitine) with improvements in body weight (BW), waist circumference (WC), body fat composition, fat distribution, and resting  expenditure (REE).Individuals with a greater reduction of choline ( < 0.0001) and l-carnitine ( < 0.01) rather than TMAO showed significant losses of BW and WC at 6 months. The reduction of choline was significantly predictive of decreases in body fat composition, fat distribution, and REE. Results of sensitivity analysis showed that the baseline diabetes risk status, such as the presence of hyperglycemia (31% of the total participants) and fasting glucose levels, did not modify the associations. Early changes in choline and l-carnitine were significantly predictive of weight loss over 2 years ( < 0.05 for all). Individuals with increases in choline or l-carnitine were 2.35-times (95% CI 1.38, 4.00) or 1.77-times (1.06, 2.95) more likely to fail to lose weight (-5% or more loss) at 2 years.Overweight and obese individuals who showed decreases in circulating choline or l-carnitine levels achieved greater improvements of adiposity and  metabolism by eating a low-calorie weight-loss diet, suggesting that such metabolites are predictive of individuals' response to the treatment. Further investigations are necessary to confirm our findings, particularly in a population with prediabetes that is more representative of the U.S. population with obesity.ClinicalTrials.gov .© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28318590>Supplementation with rumen-protected methionine or choline during the transition period influences whole-blood immune response in periparturient dairy cows.</a></h1><p>Methionine, together with Lys, is the most limiting AA for milk production in dairy cows. Besides its crucial role in milk production, Met and its derivate metabolites (e.g., glutathione, taurine, polyamines) are well-known immunonutrients in nonruminants, helping support and boost immune function and activity. In the present study, the effects of Met or choline, as its precursor, were investigated using an ex vivo whole blood challenge. The study involved 33 multiparous Holstein cows (from a larger cohort with a factorial arrangement of treatments) assigned from d -21 to +30 relative to parturition to a basal control (CON) diet, CON plus rumen-protected Met (MET, Smartamine M, Adisseo NA, Alpharetta, GA) at a rate of 0.08% of dry matter, or CON plus rumen-protected choline (CHOL, ReaShure, Balchem Inc., New Hampton, NY) at 60 g/d. Blood was sampled on d -15, -7, 2, 7, and 20 for ex vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge, and on d 1, 4, 14, and 28 relative to parturition for phagocytosis and oxidative burst assays. The MET cows had greater -corrected milk production and milk protein content. Overall, IL-6 response to LPS increased around parturition, whereas IL-1β remained constant, casting doubt on the existence of systemic immunosuppression in the peripartal period. Supplementation with MET dampened the postpartal blood response to LPS (lower IL-1β), while improving postpartum neutrophil and monocyte phagocytosis capacity and oxidative burst activity. In contrast, CHOL supplementation increased monocyte phagocytosis capacity. Overall, the data revealed a peripartal immune hyper-response, which appeared to have been mitigated by MET supplementation. Both MET and CHOL effectively improved immune function; however, MET affected the immune and antioxidant status before parturition, which might have been beneficial to prepare the cow to respond to metabolic challenges after parturition. These results provide insights on potential differences in the immunomodulatory action of methionine and choline in dairy cows. As such, the effects observed could have implications for ration formulation and dietary strategies.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The experiment was started 20 days before mating and lasted until the end of the suckling period for 60 days and weaning their kids. The first group were fed diet without supplementation and kept as control while in the second, third and fourth groups, each doe was fed diets with rumen protected choline (RPC) at the rate of 10, 20 and 40 g/day, respectively. Results showed that number of doe kidding twins and triplets and litter weight of kids born per group increased with increasing the level of RPC in the diet of goats and viability rate of born kids during the suckling period improved due to RPC supplementation in the diets of their mothers. Duration of estrous, days from weaning to estrous, days from kidding to estrous and kidding interval decreased significantly, while conception rate increased due to adding RPC. Milk choline concentrations and total choline secretion though milk were progressively increased significantly with increasing the level of RPC supplementation. Live body weight and daily body gain of their suckling male and female kids at weaning increased significantly with increasing RPC levels in the diets of their mothers.© 2017 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28497207>Evaluation of rumen-protected choline additive to diet on productive performance of male Zaraibi growing goats during hot summer season in Egypt.</a></h1><p>Twenty Zaraibi goat bucks were used in this experiment which lasted 3 months during summer season of Egypt. The animals were divided randomly into two equal groups. The first group was kept without treatment as control while in the second group, rumen-protected choline (RPC) at the level of 20 g/buck/day was added to the concentrate feed mixture at the morning feeding. RPC additives to diet of Zaraibi goat bucks during the period of hot summer season increased (P < 0.01) total gain and average daily gain compared to the control group. RPC increased (P < 0.05) dry matter intake and feed conversion while water intake was not affected by RPC additives. RPC increased (P < 0.05) red and white blood cell (RBC × 10, WBC × 10) counts and hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit percentage. RPC increased total protein (P < 0.05), globulin, and γ-globulin (P < 0.01). On the other hand, total lipids, total cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations decreased (P < 0.05 and P < 0.05) while phospholipids, glucose, and choline concentrations increased (P < 0.01) due to RPC supplementation. RPC increased (P < 0.01) thyroxin and triiodothyronine, increased (P < 0.05) testosterone levels, and decreased (P < 0.01) cortisol level compared with control bucks. It is concluded that dietary RPC at the rate of 20 g daily is required for growing male goats, especially, under heat stress conditions of summer season in Egypt and showed the best results concerning the growth, feed conversion, blood metabolites, and economic efficiency.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28965593>Isoproterenol exacerbates hyperglycemia and modulates chromium distribution in mice fed with a high fat diet.</a></h1><p>Isoproterenol (ISO), a nonselective β-adrenoceptor agonist for treating bradycardia and asthma, has been proposed to raise blood glucose level. Little is known regarding the relationship between ISO treatment, the induced chromium (Cr) redistribution, and changes in glucose metabolism. We aimed to characterize the effects of a single dose of ISO on glucose homeostasis and Cr level changes in an obesity mouse model.Mice (C57BL6/j strain) were first fed for a continuous period of 12 weeks with either a high fat diet (HFD), to develop an obesity animal model, or a standard diet (SD), to develop a lean animal model as controls. These groups were each separated into two subgroups to receive either a single dose of ISO or saline (control). We measured in vivo their metabolic parameters, fasting glucose level, area under the curve (AUC) for glucose level time profile, insulin level time profile, insulin sensitivity index, and chromium distribution.After a single dose of ISO, the SD-fed mice had slightly higher blood glucose levels compared with the SD controls, when the level was measured 30 and 60min after injection. By contrast, the ISO-treated HFD-fed mice had significantly higher blood glucose levels and AUC during the entire 120min following one administration compared with the HFD control group. Additionally, they had a substantially lower HOMA-IR index, whereas insulin levels remained unchanged. The Cr level in their bones and liver was decreased, and loss of Cr through urinary excretion was elevated.The results demonstrated that ISO exacerbated hyperglycemic syndrome in the obesity animal model. ISO induced a net negative Cr balance as a result of increased urinary excretion, leading to Cr mobilization that was not desirable to overcome the hyperglycemia.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

The engine used for this experimental work is a single cylinder CI engine with a rated power of 5.2 kW at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. The BECCS approach is a combination of plant-based biofuels and carbon capture and storage (CCS) system. The whole investigation was done in four phases: (1) Substituting diesel with Karanja oil methyl ester (KOME) (2) Equal volume blending of Orange oil (ORG) with KOME (3) 20% blending of n-butanol (B) with KOME-ORG blend (4) CCS system with zeolite based non-selective catalytic reduction (NSCR) and mono  (MEA) based selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) system with KOME-ORG + B20 blend. The experimental results show that substitution of diesel with KOME reduces smoke emission, but increases NO and CO emission. KOME-ORG blend reduces CO and smoke emissions with high NO emission due to combustion improvement. In comparison with the sole combustion of KOME at full load condition, the combination of KOME-ORG + B20 as bio-fuel with zeolite based post-combustion treatment system resulted in a maximum reduction of NO, smoke and CO emission by 41%, 19% and 15% respectively.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29567183>Simultaneous determination of isoproterenol, acetaminophen, folic acid, propranolol and caffeine using a sensor platform based on carbon black, graphene oxide, copper nanoparticles and PEDOT:PSS.</a></h1><p>We explored the use of carbon black (CB), graphene oxide (GO), copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as electrode materials for the simultaneous determination of isoproterenol, acetaminophen, folic acid, propranolol and caffeine. The designed nanostructured surface was widely characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM),  dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), contact angle measurements and electrochemistry. From electrochemical characterization assays carried out towards the potassium ferricyanide redox probe, fast electron transfer kinetics and a considerably higher electroactive surface area were observed for the modified electrodic surface based on CB, GO, CuNPs and PEDOT:PSS film. Using square-wave voltammetry (SWV), well defined and resolved anodic peaks were detected for isoproterenol, acetaminophen, folic acid, propranolol and caffeine, with peak-to-peak potential separation not less than 170 mV. Then, the SWV technique was explored for the simultaneous determination of quinary mixtures of these analytes, resulting in analytical curves with linear ranges and limits of detection at micromolar concentration levels. The practical viability of the proposed voltammetric sensor was illustrated in the analysis of human body fluid samples. The proposed sensor showed good repeatability and a successful application using urine and serum matrices, with recoveries close to 100%.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p></html>
