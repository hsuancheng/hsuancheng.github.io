Specifically, p-type Pdots (p-Pdots) and n-type CdS QDs (n-CdS) were utilized to form organic-inorganic nanoparticles p-n heterojunction to enhance signal response, and their specific  levels (VB/CB or HOMO/LUMO) were calculated for photoelectrochemical (PEC) bioanalysis application. At the same time, the combination of molecular imprinting technology and photoelectrochemistry overcomes the defeats of photoelectrochemistry which is the absence of selectivity, offers a new MIP-PEC sensor with high sensitivity and excellent selectivity based heterojunction enhanced strategy. In short, this study proposes the semiconducting organic-inorganic nanoparticles p-n heterojunction for molecularly imprinted polymer photoelectrochemcal bioanalysis application, and the MIP-PEC sensor was successfully fabricated based on these materials and methods. In the phosphate buffer solution (PBS), it was clearly observed that the photocurrent has a significant change between elution in acetic acid-ethanol mixture and incubation in template molecular solution because of the faster electron transfer speed, this phenomenon fully showed that the MIP-PEC sensor can specifically detect the target. Thus, the work typically offers a linear range from 0.01 to 1000 ng mL with a detection limit of 6.5 pg mL for α-Solanine. Furthermore, the fabricated MIP-PEC sensor will confirm the actual application.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Using the linear ion trap (LIT) mass spectrometry, multistage collisional-induced dissociation (CID) experiments (MS(n)) on the [M + H](+) precursor ions were performed to aid the elucidation of the mass fragmentation pathways. In addition, higher  collisional-induced dissociation (HCD) mass spectra were generated for these toxins at a high resolution setting [100,000 FWHM (full width at half maximum)] using the Orbitrap. This hybrid mass spectrometry instrumentation was exploited to produce MS(3) spectra by selecting MS(2) product ions, generated using LIT MS, and fragmentation using HCD. The accurate mass data in the MS(3) spectra aided the confirmation of proposed product ion formulae. The precursor and product ions from glycoalkaloids lost up to four sugars from different regions during MS(n) experiments. Mass fragmentation of the six-ring aglycons were similar, generating major product ions that resulted from cleavages at the B-rings and E-rings.2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25805907>Direct Biotransformation of Dioscin into  in Rhizome of Dioscorea zingiberensis by Penicillium dioscin.</a></h1><p> is an important precursor for synthesis of more than 200 steroidal hormone medicines. Rhizome of Dioscorea zingiberensis C. H. Wright (RDZ) contained the highest content of  in Dioscorea plant species.  is traditionally extracted by acid hydrolysis from RDZ. However, the acid hydrolysis process produces massive wastewater which caused serious environment pollution. In this study,  extraction by direct biotransformation with Penicillium dioscin was investigated. The spawn cultivation conditions were optimized as: Czapeks liquid culture medium without sugar and agar (1,000 ml) + 6.0 g dioscin/6.0 g DL, 30 °C, 36 h; solid fermentation of RDZ: mycelia/RDZ of 0.05 g/kg, 30 °C, 50 h; the yield of  was over 90 %. Spawn cultivation was crucial for the direct biotransformation. In the spawn cultivation, amount and ratio of dioscin/DL were the key factors to promote biotransformation activity of P. dioscin. This biotransformation method was environment-friendly, simple and  saving, and might be a potential substitute for acid hydrolysis in  extraction industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26352464>Effect of Detergents on Galactoside Binding by Melibiose Permeases.</a></h1><p>The effect of various detergents on the stability and function of the melibiose permeases of Escherichia coli (MelBEc) and Salmonella typhimurium (MelBSt) was studied. In n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) or n-undecyl-β-d-maltoside (UDM), WT MelBSt binds melibiose with an affinity similar to that in the membrane. However, with WT MelBEc or MelBSt mutants (Arg141 → Cys, Arg295 → Cys, or Arg363 → Cys), galactoside binding is not detected in these detergents, but binding to the phosphotransferase protein IIA(Glc) is maintained. In the amphiphiles lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (MNG-3) or glyco- (GDN), galactoside binding with all of the MelB proteins is observed, with slightly reduced affinities. MelBSt is more thermostable than MelBEc, and the thermostability of either MelB is largely increased in MNG-3 or GDN. Therefore, the functional defect with DDM or UDM likely results from the relative instability of the sensitive MelB proteins, and stability, as well as galactoside binding, is retained in MNG-3 or GDN. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry of melibiose binding with MelBSt shows that the favorable entropic contribution to the binding free  is decreased in MNG-3, indicating that the conformational dynamics of MelB is restricted in this detergent.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25609476>Potent effects of dioscin against obesity in mice.</a></h1><p>The mechanisms of the natural product dioscin against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are unclear. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to further confirm its effects of prevention and then to elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying its activity in mice. High-fat diet (HFD)-induced C57BL/6J mice and ob/ob mice were used as the experimental models. Serum and hepatic biochemical parameters were determined, and the mRNA and protein expression levels were detected. The results indicated that dioscin alleviated body weight and liver lipid accumulation symptoms, increased oxygen consumption and energy expenditure, and improved the levels of serum and hepatic biochemical parameters. Further investigations revealed that dioscin significantly attenuated oxidative damage, suppressed , inhibited triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis, promoted fatty acid β-oxidation, down-regulated MAPK phosphorylation levels, and induced autophagy to alleviate fatty liver conditions. Dioscin prevents diet induced obesity and NAFLD by increasing energy expenditure. This agent should be developed as a new candidate for obesity and NAFLD prevention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23553978>Interaction between ganglioside G(M1) and  in langmuir monolayers at the air/water interface.</a></h1><p>The interaction between ganglioside GM1 (GM1) and  (Dios) in mixed monolayers was investigated using surface pressure measurements and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The miscibility and stability of the mixed monolayer was evaluated both in a qualitative and quantitative way in terms of the excess mean molecular area (ΔAex), excess Gibbs  (ΔGex). The ΔAex of mixed GM1/Dios monolayer was found to have positive deviations from ideality at low Dios mole fractions (XDios = 0.2). Above XDios = 0.2, there was a marked negative deviation from ideal mixing, indicating attractive interaction between G(M1) and Dios. According to the values of excess Gibbs  of mixing monolayers, the more stable monolayers assayed was: XDios = 0.6. The compressibility coefficient was assessed at various surface pressures. The monolayer of Dios was more elasticity or rigid than G(M1). The AFM images for the mixed monolayers at 30 mN/m indicated there was obvious phase separation in the mixed monolayers. These findings will provide useful information for understanding the interaction between drug and lipids.© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19217925>A 28-day repeat dose toxicity study of steroidal glycoalkaloids, alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in the Syrian Golden hamster.</a></h1><p>Glycoalkaloids alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine are naturally present toxicants in the potato plant (Solanumtuberosum). Human intake of high doses of glycoalkaloids has led to acute intoxication, in severe cases coma and death. Previous studies have indicated that the ratio of alpha-solanine to alpha-chaconine may determine the degree and nature of the glycoalkaloid toxicity in potatoes, as the toxicity of the two alkaloids act synergistically. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether an altered ratio of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine would reduce the toxicity of the glycoalkaloids. The Syrian Golden hamster was given daily doses of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine by gavage for 28 days. Doses of up to 33.3 mg total glycoalkaloids/kg body weight were applied in ratios of 1:3.7 and 1:70 (alpha-solanine:alpha-chaconine). Administration of the highest doses of both ratios resulted in distended and fluid filled small intestines and stomach. Animals receiving the ratio with the reduced content of alpha-solanine were less affected compared to those receiving the other ratio. Gene expression profiling experiments were conducted using RNA from epithelial scrapings from the small intestines of the hamsters administered the highest doses of the glycoalkaloid treatments. In general, more differential gene expression was observed in the epithelial scrapings of the hamsters fed the ratio of 1:3.7. Mostly, pathways involved in lipid and  metabolism were affected by the ratio of 1:3.7.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29589340>Influence of Nutritional Status on the Absorption of Polyphyllin I, an Anticancer Candidate from Paris polyphylla in Rats.</a></h1><p>Protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) is one of the most suffered complications in cancer patients. Polyphyllin I (PPI), a saponin isolated from rhizome of Paris polyphylla, is a potential candidate in cancer therapy. In this study, the influence of nutritional status on the absorption of PPI in rats was explored after oral administration.PCM rats, namely mal-nourished (MN) rats, were induced from well-nourished (WN) rats by caloric restriction protocol. Intestinal absorption of PPI in WN and MN rats was evaluated by pharmacokinetic and intestinal perfusion methods. The potential mechanisms between two groups were investigated on the basis of intestinal permeability, intestinal efflux and PPI's depletions in vivo. The intestinal permeability was analyzed by determining the concentration of paracellular marker transport in serum and the expression of  proteins in intestine. The intestinal efflux was evaluated through comparing the protein level of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in intestine, and the depletions of PPI and/or generation of its metabolites in liver and intestines were analyzed by liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method.Compared to WN rats, the oral systemic exposure of PPI was significantly increased in MN rats, evidenced by significant enhancement of maximum plasma concentration (C) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) by more than 2.51- and 3.71-folds as well as terminal elimination half-life (t) prolonged from to 7.3 to 14.1 h. Further studies revealed that the potential mechanism might be associated with combined contribution of improved intestinal absorption and depressed deglycosylation of PPI in MN rats. Furthermore, enhanced intestinal absorption of PPI was benefited from increased intestinal permeability and decreased intestinal efflux in MN rats. Meanwhile, the former manifested as increased transport of paracellular marker and decreased  proteins levels, while the later evidenced by reduced P-gp expression.The oral exposure of PPI was enhanced in MN rats, which suggested that nutritional status alters the absorption of PPI, and thus the dosage of PPI should be modified during the treatment of cancer patient with PCM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29351216>In Silico and In Vitro Study of the Bromelain-Phytochemical Complex Inhibition of Phospholipase A2 (Pla2).</a></h1><p>Phospholipase A2 (Pla2) is an enzyme that induces , making Pla2 activity an effective approach to reduce .

It is not clear whether the primary step in this process is flopping of cholesterol from the inner to the outer leaflet of the canalicular membrane, with desorption by mixed micelles, or decreasing of the activation  required for cholesterol desorption from the outer membrane leaflet. In this study, we investigated these mechanisms by infusing Abcg8(+/+), Abcg8(+/-), and Abcg8(-/-) mice with hydrophilic and hydrophobic bile salts. In Abcg8(-/-) mice, this failed to substantially stimulate biliary cholesterol secretion. Infusion of the hydrophobic bile salt taurodeoxycholate also resulted in cholestasis, which was induced in Abcg8(-/-) mice at a much lower infusion rate compared with Abc8(-/-) and Abcg8(+/-) mice, suggesting a reduced cholesterol content in the outer leaflet of the canalicular membrane. Indeed, isolation of canalicular membranes revealed a reduction of 45% in cholesterol content under these conditions in Abcg8(-/-) mice. Our data support the model that ABCG5/ABCG8 primarily play a role in flopping cholesterol (and sterols) from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet of the canalicular membrane.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586606>Pharmacological Activities of Dehydroepiandrosterone: A Review.</a></h1><p>Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a steroidal hormone secreted by Zonareticularis of the adrenal cortex with a characteristic age related pattern of secretion. These hormones are inactive precursors that are transformed into active sex steroids in peripheral target tissues. These hormones are used for the , vitality and the natural support of most bodily functions that involve the endocrine system. DHEA is a 19 carbon steroid hormone, is lipophilic, and can be converted to DHEAs by activity of the enzyme sulphotransferasein the liver and adrenal glands. These are naturally synthesized in our body through cholesterol- pregnenolone pathway and can also be synthesized from various other sources like , geniestein, wild yam, soy and cholesterol in laboratory. It serves as an indirect precursor to estrogen and testosterone and other steroid hormones. This hormone progressively declines at the rate of 2% per year. DHEA evidence a large variety of pharmacological activities like antidiabetic, anticancer, anti-allergic, obesity treatment and cardiovascular property. It is beneficial in autoimmune disorders like lupus erythematosus, immune modulation, muscle building and hormonal problems. DHEA is known as an anti-ageing hormone, in osteoporosis and in dementia.

The development of therapeutic agents promoting both cytotoxicity and cell differentiation may provide opportunities to improve the clinical outcome. Dioscin-induced apoptosis in leukemic cells was identified through death receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptosis pathway. The formation of Bak and tBid, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential were induced by dioscin suggesting the activation of intrinsic apoptotsis pathway. A functional analysis of transcription factors using transcription factor-DNA interaction array and IPA analysis demonstrated that dioscin induced a profound increase of protein expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), a critical factor for myeloid differentiation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis assay confirmed the increase of C/EBPα expression. Dioscin-induced differentiation was substantiated by an increase of CD11b protein expression and the induction of differentiation toward myelomonocytic/granulocytic lineages using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Moreover, both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis assay and IPA network enrichment analysis were proposed to dioscin action. In conclusion, the data suggest that dioscin exerts its antileukemic effect through the upregulation of both death ligands and death receptors and a crosstalk activation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway with the collaboration of tBid and Bak formation. In addition, proteomics approach reveals an altered metabolic signature of dioscin-treated cells and the induction of differentiation of promyelocytes to granulocytes and monocytes in which the C/EBPα plays a key role.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26706905>Interaction of Quercetin of Onion with Axon Guidance Protein Receptor, NRP-1 Plays Important Role in Cancer Treatment: An In Silico Approach.</a></h1><p>Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor whose distinct sites bind semaphorins and vascular endothelial growth factor family members to mediate the role of these ligands in neuronal axon guidance and angiogenesis, respectively. Similarly, Eph receptors and ephrin ligands play critical roles in various biological functions, and deregulated activation of Eph/ephrin signaling in humans is thought to lead to tumorigenesis. Therefore, in this paper, an attempt was made to elucidate the inhibition potential of nine bioactive compounds from four different native spices of Bangladesh against this couple of receptors via molecular docking study.

This substance is derived from acidic pentosan in Dioscorea zingiberensis and is also found in a variety of agricultural byproducts, including corncobs, oat, wheat bran, and sawdust. It is regarded as a toxicant and an inhibitor to the growth of microorganism in both sewage disposal and biological fermentation. A furfural-degrading strain (DS1) was isolated from activated sludge of wastewater treatment plant in a  factory by continuous enrichment culture. The strain was identified as Bacillus cereus based on morphological, physiological tests, as well as on 16S rDNA sequence and Biolog analyses. The capacity of this strain to grow on a mineral salt medium, utilizing furfural as the sole carbon and energy source to degrade furfural, was investigated in this study. Under the condition of pH 9.0, temperature 35 °C, with rotating speed of 150 rpm, and an inoculum of 6 %, the strain showed that the furfural degradation capacity reaches 35 % in 7 days, as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The addition of inorganic carbon sources could bring down the biodegradation efficiency of the furfural. The strain DS1 showed better furfural removal capacity, as compared to other inorganic carbon sources in the media. Furthermore, a furfural concentration of as high as 4,000 mg L(-1) was tolerated by the culture. The capacity to degrade furfural was demonstrated for the first time by using the genus B. cereus.

Additional tests assessed the relationship between leaf position and the concentration of saponins (plant compounds which can provide protection from insect herbivores) and examined the effect of defoliation on switchgrass dry mass. Survival to adulthood was similar when larvae were reared on field-grown leaves of switchgrass and corn. However, lower larval mass (10 d) and delayed development of M. unipuncta (to pupation, adult emergence) suggest switchgrass is an inferior host relative to corn. When fed field-grown miscanthus, no larvae survived 10 d. Few differences were noted between switchgrass and corn grown under controlled (laboratory) conditions, but M. unipuncta survival seemed to decline rapidly when larvae were fed the fourth and fifth leaves of switchgrass. Switchgrass leaf samples collected from different leaf positions and stages of tiller maturity showed up to 10-fold differences in the concentration of the saponin protodioscin, with the greatest concentrations in the fourth and fifth leaves. However, other saponins showed an opposite pattern, indicating the role of protodioscin on insect development should be tested in isolation (e.g., by addition of the purified compound to an artificial diet). Defoliation trials indicated that extremely high M. unipuncta populations may be necessary to cause any significant reduction in switchgrass biomass. Collectively, results suggest M. unipuncta may not present a significant risk to biomass production in switchgrass, but that the spring emergence of switchgrass provides an alternate host for M. unipuncta before colonizing annual food and feed crops.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21106928>, the main aglycon of fenugreek, inhibits LXRα activity in HepG2 cells and decreases plasma and hepatic triglycerides in obese diabetic mice.</a></h1><p>Trigonella foenum-graecum (fenugreek) can ameliorate dyslipidemia, but the detailed mechanism is unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of fenugreek on hepatic lipid metabolism, particularly lipogenesis, which is enhanced in obesity and diabetes, in diabetic obese KK-Ay mice. KK-Ay mice were fed a control high-fat diet (HFD; 60% of  as fat) (C group) or an HFD containing 0.5% or 2% fenugreek (0.5F and 2.0F groups, respectively) for 4 wk. Hepatic and plasma TG and mRNA expression levels of lipogenic genes were lower in the 2.0F group at 4 wk (P < 0.05), but not in the 0.5F group, than in the C group. The hydrolyzed saponin fraction, but not the saponin fraction per se, in fenugreek inhibited the accumulation of TG in HepG2 cells. We fractionated the hydrolyzed saponin into 15 fractions by HPLC and examined the effect of these fractions on TG accumulation in HepG2 cells. Fraction 11 inhibited TG accumulation in HepG2 cells and we determined by liquid chromatography tandem MS that the active substance contained in fraction 11 is .

Next, B3LYP/6-311++G(**) level geometry optimizations were carried out, albeit on a simpler model. The relative Gibbs free energies and geometry parameters are presented for the optimized structures. Conformational analysis concerning the clockwise (cw) and counterclockwise (ccw) arrangements of the OH groups as well as the three orientations of the NH2 and CH2OH groups was performed. Furthermore, a full scan of all the possible locations of the diosgenyl moiety in relation to the sugar ring in the target compounds was done. The PM3 optimization results indicate that diosgenyl 2-amino-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranoside exists as a mixture of many rotamers. Of these, ccw conformers as well as the -ac orientation of the aglycone (ca -100° for torsion angle φ) are preferred. In the case of the N-protonated glucoside one rotamer is dominant in the mixture (population>60%). Only the cw arrangement is stable in the protonated form, because of steric and electronic repulsion between the charged ammonium group and the hydrogen atom of the neighbouring 3-OH group. The gauche-trans (gt) orientation of the CH2OH group is favourable to both neutral and protonated forms of diosgenyl glucosides at the PM3 level. DFT studies also predict conformational mixtures for both neutral and protonated forms of simplified diosgenyl 2-amino-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranosides. These investigations showed unequivocally the preference for the ccw arrangement over cw, and that values of angle φ concur with the exo-anomeric effect. The B3LYP functional predicts the greater stability of the gt and tg orientations for the neutral and protonated analogues respectively. According to both PM3 and B3LYP calculations, torsion angle ψ has only a minor influence on the conformational . The importance of the geometry parameters affecting the stability of these conformers appears to be as follows: angle φ≈NH2/ccw/cw>gg/gt/tg>angle ψ.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Our previous study indicated that  (DSG) has a beneficial effect on  metabolism, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear.Human normal hepatocytes (LO2 cells) were incubated with palmitic acid to establish the cell model of nonalcoholic fatty liver. The effects of DSG on lipid metabolism, glucose uptake and mitochondrial function were evaluated. Furthermore, the mechanism of DSG on oxidative stress, lipid consumption and lipid synthesis in LO2 cells was investigated.The results indicated that palmitic acid induced obvious lipid accumulation in LO2 cells and that DSG treatment significantly reduced the intracellular lipid content. DSG treatment upregulated expression of lipolysis proteins, including phospho-AMP activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), phospho-acetyl-coA carboxylase (p-ACC) and carnitine acyl transferase 1A (CPT-1A), and inhibited expression of lipid synthesis-related proteins, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). Additionally, DSG-treated cells displayed a marked improvement in mitochondrial function, with less production of reactive oxygen species and a higher mitochondrial membrane potential compared with the model group.This study suggests that DSG can reduce intracellular lipid accumulation in LO2 cells and that the underlying mechanism may be related to the improving oxidative stress, increasing fatty acid β-oxidation and decreasing lipid synthesis. The above changes might be mediated by the activation of the AMPK/ACC/CPT-1A pathway and inhibition of the SREBP-1c/FAS pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17090106>Potato glycoalkaloids and metabolites: roles in the plant and in the diet.</a></h1><p>Potatoes, members of the Solanaceae plant family, serve as major, inexpensive low-fat food sources providing  (starch), high-quality protein, fiber, and vitamins. Potatoes also produce biologically active secondary metabolites, which may have both adverse and beneficial effects in the diet. These include glycoalkaloids, calystegine alkaloids, protease inhibitors, lectins, phenolic compounds, and chlorophyll. Because glycoalkaloids are reported to be involved in host-plant resistance and to have a variety of adverse as well as beneficial effects in cells, animals, and humans, a need exists to develop a clearer understanding of their roles both in the plant and in the diet. To contribute to this effort, this integrated review presents data on the (a) history of glycoalkaloids; (b) glycoalkaloid content in different parts of the potato plant, in processed potato products, and in wild, transgenic, and organic potatoes; (c) biosynthesis, inheritance, plant molecular biology, and glycoalkaloid-plant phytopathogen relationships; (d) dietary significance with special focus on the chemistry, analysis, and nutritional quality of low-glycoalkaloid potato protein; (e) pharmacology and toxicology of the potato glycoalkaloids comprising alpha-chaconine and alpha-solanine and their hydrolysis products (metabolites); (f) anticarcinogenic and other beneficial effects; and (g) possible dietary consequences of concurrent consumption of glycoalkaloids and other biologically active compounds present in fresh and processed potatoes. An enhanced understanding of the multiple and overlapping aspects of glycoalkaloids in the plant and in the diet will benefit producers and consumers of potatoes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12647595>[Glycoalkaloids in potatoes].</a></h1><p>With its high concentration in starch and vitamins (C, B1 and B2), the potato, cooked in water, is a very interesting source of . Unfortunately, it also contains natural toxins: the glycoalkaloids. Their variable amount can depend, in particular, on different environmental factors. This paper summarizes these factors effects and the glycoalcaloids toxicology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30408964>Complex formation equilibria between cholesterol and  analogues in monolayers determined by the Langmuir method.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between  analogues [DioA:  acetate (DAc) and (25)-5α,6β-dihydroxyspirostan-3β-ol acetate (DSol)] and cholesterol (Ch) monolayers at the air/water interface. The surface tension of pure and mixed lipid monolayers at 22 °C was measured by using the Langmuir method with a Teflon trough and a Nima 9002 tensiometer. The surface tension values were used to calculate the π-A isotherms and to determine the molecular surface areas. The interactions between Ch and each DioA resulted in significant deviations from the additivity rule. The theory described in this work was used to determine the stability constants, the areas occupied by one molecule of Ch-DAc or Ch-DSol, and the complex formation  (Gibbs free ) values.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666479> Supplementation Prevents Lipid Accumulation and Induces Skeletal Muscle-Fiber Hypertrophy in Rats.</a></h1><p> (Dio) is a steroid sapogenin found in plants such as Dioscorea species, and is recognized as a phytochemical against various disorders as well as a natural precursor of steroidal drugs. The present study used rats fed high-cholesterol (Chol) diets supplemented with or without 0.5% Dio for 6 wk to investigate the effects of dietary Dio on lipid metabolism. Dio supplementation significantly increased serum high-density lipoprotein Chol concentrations and fecal Chol content, and significantly decreased fecal bile acid content compared rats fed a high-Chol diet alone, showing that dietary Dio may facilitate excretion of Chol rather than bile acids. A reduction in the liver triglyceride content and intra-abdominal visceral fat was observed in Dio-supplemented rats. Interestingly, dietary Dio also significantly increased the skeletal muscle-fiber diameter and area in the thigh muscles of the rats. Mouse myoblast-derived C2C12 cells were used to examine whether Dio directly affected skeletal muscle. Dio promoted fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated cells or myotubes. Furthermore, in myotube C2C12 cells, protein levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increased with Dio treatment in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that Dio may not only induce myoblast fusion and enhance skeletal muscle as an  expenditure organ, but may also activate the catabolic pathway via AMPK in skeletal muscle cells. Thus, these effects of Dio on skeletal muscles may contribute to inhibition of visceral fat accumulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17955193>Biotransformation of  to nuatigenin-type steroid by a newly isolated strain, Streptomyces virginiae IBL-14.</a></h1><p>An actinomycete strain IBL-14 isolated from soil by utilizing  as the sole carbon and  source was identified as Streptomyces virginiae. S. virginiae IBL-14 can transform  to isonuatigenone. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of producing rare nuatigenin-type spirosteroid (isonuatigenone) from pyrano-spirosteroid () by microbial transformation. From  to isonuatigenone, the pathway has been confirmed in this study that  was first converted to diosgenone, and then diosgenone was transformed to isonuatigenone by the C25 tertiary hydroxylation reaction. It appeared to be favorable to accumulate isonuatigenone when  was added to the onset of the stationary phase of cell growth, and the yield of isonuatigenone was about 28.4% during 48 h from 1.5 mM . The C25 tertiary hydroxylation of diosgenone by S. virginiae IBL-14 is a novel and interesting reaction and will be a practical tool in producing natural nuatigenin-type steroids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22334779>Synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Dioscorea bulbifera tuber extract and evaluation of its synergistic potential in combination with antimicrobial agents.</a></h1><p>Development of an environmentally benign process for the synthesis of silver nanomaterials is an important aspect of current nanotechnology research. Among the 600 species of the genus Dioscorea, Dioscorea bulbifera has profound therapeutic applications due to its unique phytochemistry. In this paper, we report on the rapid synthesis of silver nanoparticles by reduction of aqueous Ag(+) ions using D. bulbifera tuber extract.Phytochemical analysis revealed that D. bulbifera tuber extract is rich in flavonoid, phenolics, reducing sugars, starch, , ascorbic acid, and citric acid. The biosynthesis process was quite fast, and silver nanoparticles were formed within 5 hours. Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy,  dispersive spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction confirmed reduction of the Ag(+) ions. Varied morphology of the bioreduced silver nanoparticles included spheres, triangles, and hexagons. Optimization studies revealed that the maximum rate of synthesis could be achieved with 0.7 mM AgNO(3) solution at 50°C in 5 hours. The resulting silver nanoparticles were found to possess potent antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Beta-lactam (piperacillin) and macrolide (eryth-romycin) antibiotics showed a 3.6-fold and 3-fold increase, respectively, in combination with silver nanoparticles selectively against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Notable synergy was seen between silver nanoparticles and chloramphenicol or vancomycin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and was supported by a 4.9-fold and 4.2-fold increase in zone diameter, respectively. Similarly, we found a maximum 11.8-fold increase in zone diameter of streptomycin when combined with silver nanoparticles against E. coli, providing strong evidence for the synergistic action of a combination of antibiotics and silver nanoparticles.This is the first report on the synthesis of silver nanoparticles using D. bulbifera tuber extract followed by an estimation of its synergistic potential for enhancement of the antibacterial activity of broad spectrum antimicrobial agents.</p></html>
