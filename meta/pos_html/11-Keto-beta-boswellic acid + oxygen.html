The nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway has been considered a potential target for neuroprotection in stroke. Acetyl-11-Keto-β-Boswellic Acid (AKBA) is an active triterpenoid compound from the extract of Boswellia serrate. The present study was to determine whether AKBA, a novel Nrf2 activator, can protect against cerebral ischemic injury. The stroke model was produced in Sprague-Dawley rats via middle cerebral artery occlusion. To model ischemia-like conditions in vitro, primary cultured cortical neurons were exposed to transient oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). Treatment of AKBA significantly reduced infarct volumes and apoptotic cells, and also increased neurologic scores by elevating the Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in brain tissues in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats at 48 hours post reperfusion. In primary cultured neurons, AKBA increased the Nrf2 and HO-1 expression, which provided protection against OGD-induced oxidative insult. Additionally, AKBA treatment increased Nrf2 binding activity to antioxidant-response elements (ARE). The protective effect of AKBA was attenuated by knockdown of Nrf2 or HO-1. In conclusion, these findings provide evidence that AKBA protects neurons against ischemic injury, and this neuroprotective effect involves the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26162321>Enhanced Neuroprotection of Acetyl-11-Keto-β-Boswellic Acid (AKBA)-Loaded O-Carboxymethyl Chitosan Nanoparticles Through Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Pathways.</a></h2><p>Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), a main active constituent from Boswellia serrata resin, is a novel candidate for therapy of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Nevertheless, its poor solubility in aqueous solvent, bioavailability, and rapid clearance limit its curative efficacy. To enhance its potency, in our study, AKBA-loaded o-carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticle (AKBA-NP) delivery system was synthesized. The transmission electron microscopy and transmission electron microscope images of AKBA-NPs suggested that particle size was 132 ± 18 nm, and particles were spherical in shape with smooth morphology. In pharmacokinetics study, AKBA-NPs apparently increases the area under the curve of plasma concentration-time and prolonged half-life compared with AKBA. The tissue distribution study confirmed that AKBA-NPs had a better brain delivery efficacy in comparison with AKBA. The results from our pharmacodynamic studies showed that AKBA-NPs possess better neuroprotection compared with AKBA in primary neurons with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model and in animals with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Additionally, AKBA-NPs modulate antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways more effectively than AKBA by increasing nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 and heme oxygenase-1 expression, and by decreasing nuclear factor-kappa B and 5-lipoxygenase expression. Collectively, our results suggest that AKBA-NPs serve as a potent delivery vehicle for AKBA in cerebral ischemic therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29513961>NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECT OF BOSWELLIA SERRATA AND ITS ACTIVE CONSTITUENT ACETYL 11-KETO-β-BOSWELLIC ACID AGAINST OXYGEN-GLUCOSE-SERUM DEPRIVATION-INDUCED CELL INJURY.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress plays a key role in pathophysiology of brain ischemia. This study aimed to test whether B. serrata hydroalcoholic extract (BSE) and its active constituent 3-acetyl-1 1-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) could protect neurons against ischemic condition induced by oxygen, glucose and serum deprivation (OGSD). First, PC12 neural cells were incubated with BSE (0-400 pg/mL) or AKBA (0-40 pg/mL) for 24 h to find non-cytotoxic concentrations of BSE and AKBA. Then, the cells were pre- (for 2 h) and co-treated with 1.5-6 μg/mL BSE or 0.5-2.5 pg/mL AKBA, and then exposed to OGSD condition for 6 h. The IC50. values of BSE and AKBA were 95 and 12.2 μg/mL, respectively. BSE (3 and 6 pg/mL) and AKBA (1 and 2.5 pg/mL) significantly increased viability of ischemic cells, in a concertation-dependent manner. The levels of intracellular oxygen free radicals, lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage were also significantly and concentration-dependently decreased following treatment of ischemic cells with BSE or AKBA. Using HPLC analysis, the mount of AKBA in a sample of BSE was found to be 9.2%. In conclusion, B. sernata and AKBA reduce neuronal cell death induced by OGSD and this neuroprotective effect is mediated via attenuation of oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642100>3-Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid attenuated oxidative glutamate toxicity in neuron-like cell lines by apoptosis inhibition.</a></h2><p>3-Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), a pentacyclic triterpenic acid present in gum resin of Boswellia serrata, has been found to possess antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. In this study, we aimed to examine protective properties of AKBA against glutamate-induced neuronal injury. To investigate the effects of AKBA (2.5-10 µM) on glutamate injury in neuron-like cells PC12 and N2a, two treatment regimens (incubation for 2 or 0 hours before glutamate exposure) were used. Then, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method was used to determine viability of the cells. Cellular redox status was evaluated using fluorimetry and comet assays. Annexin V/propidium iodide double staining and Western blot analysis of relative apoptotic proteins were conducted. Based on the results, 24 hours incubation with glutamate (8 mM) increased the cell mortality of PC12 and N2a (P < .001). However, AKBA (2.5-10 µM) enhanced the cell viability in both treatment regimens (P < .001). Also co- and pretreatment with AKBA significantly attenuated lipid peroxidation, reactive  species production, and DNA injury (P < .05 and P < .001). AKBA also restored the activity of cellular superoxide dismutase under glutamate toxicity; this effect was seen to be more significant during the pretreatment regimen (P < .001). Moreover, Western blot analysis indicated that AKBA inhibited glutamate-induced programmed cell death through depressing the elevation of the expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and cleaved-caspase-3 proteins, concentration-dependently. Overall, the present findings suggest the neuroprotective activities of AKBA against glutamate-induced cell injury probably by inhibiting oxidative damage and reducing apoptotic cell death.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27121241>Antioxidant effects of hydroxysafflor yellow A and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid in combination on isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury in rats.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress plays an important role in the initiation and development of myocardial injury (MI). The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC‑1α)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway is considered to be a potential target for cardioprotection in MI. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is the major organic acid component extracted from Boswellia serrata Roxb. ex Colebr. Hydroxysafﬂor yellow A (HSYA) is the principal active constituent of Carthamus tinctorius L. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of HSYA and AKBA in combination in vivo and in vitro, as well as the underlying mechanisms responsible for these effects. For this purpose, MI was produced in Sprague-Dawley rats by subcutaneous injection with isoproterenol. To model ischemic-like conditions in vitro, H9C2 cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). The levels of creatine kinase-MB (CK‑MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA) as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were examined as well as apoptotic cell death. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm or MMP) were measured using MitoSOX Red and 5,5',6,6'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) dye. The expression of PGC-1α and Nrf2 was quantified by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. HSYA and AKBA prevented myocardial pathological changes, signiﬁcantly reduced the blood levels of CK-MB and LDH, and decreased apoptotic cell death. They significantly increased the expression of PGC-1α and Nrf2, and the activity of the antioxidant enzyme SOD and also decreased the levels of MDA and ROS. Moreover, the reduction in MMP was partly prevented by HSYA and AKBA. Taken together, these findings elucidate the underlying mechanisms through which HSYA and AKBA protect against MI. Additionally, HSYA and AKBA appear to act synergistically in order to exert cardioprotective effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28009003>Acetyl-11-Keto-β-Boswellic Acid Attenuates Prooxidant and Profibrotic Mechanisms Involving Transforming Growth Factor-β1, and Improves Vascular Remodeling in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats.</a></h2><p>Vascular remodeling is an important complication of hypertension with oxidative stress-related profibrotic  involved. The transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) has been shown to be a potential target of vasoprotection, and has multiple roles in vascular remodeling. Acetyl-11-Keto-β-Boswellic Acid (AKBA) is one of the active principles of Boswellic acids, and shows antioxidant activity in many diseases. The study is to determine effects of AKBA on systemic oxidative stress of hypertension and vascular remodeling. In the experiments, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were used. And in vitro, fibroblast was pretreated with AKBA before Ang II stimuli. In the results, treatment of AKBA markedly reduced oxidative stress, and decreased vascular remodeling by restoring vascular wall parameters and improving vascular reactivity. AKBA dramatically reduced TGF-β1 and Smad3 expression, as shown in immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. In cultured fibroblast, AKBA decreased intracellular ROS levels. Cell viability and proliferation, as well as migration were inhibited by AKBA. Additionally, treatment of AKBA significantly decreased TGF-β1 secretion in culture supernatant. Expression of TGF-β1, Smad3, P-Smad3 and Smad7 were also decreased by AKBA in fibroblast. In conclusion, AKBA is able to attenuate oxidative stress and profibrotic mechanisms, and improve vascular remodeling in hypertension through TGF-β1/Smad3 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25452227>Posttreatment with 11-Keto-β-Boswellic Acid Ameliorates Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury: Nrf2/HO-1 Pathway as a Potential Mechanism.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress is well known to play a pivotal role in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. The nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway has been considered a potential target for neuroprotection in stroke. 11-Keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA) is a triterpenoid compound from extracts of Boswellia serrata. The aim of the present study was to determine whether KBA, a novel Nrf2 activator, can protect against cerebral ischemic injury. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was operated on male Sprague-Dawley rats. KBA (25 mg/kg) applied 1 h after reperfusion significantly reduced infarct volumes and apoptotic cells as well as increased neurologic scores at 48 h after reperfusion. Meanwhile, posttreatment with KBA significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, restored the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and increased the protein Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in brain tissues. In primary cultured astrocytes, KBA increased the Nrf2 and HO-1 expression, which provided protection against oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced oxidative insult. But knockdown of Nrf2 or HO-1 attenuated the protective effect of KBA. In conclusion, these findings provide evidence that the neuroprotection of KBA against oxidative stress-induced ischemic injury involves the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27494534>Boswellia serrata Protects Against Glutamate-Induced Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis in PC12 and N2a Cells.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to investigate whether the extract from Boswellia serrata oleo-gum resin (BSE) can protect against glutamate-induced oxidative damage and cytotoxicity in PC12 and N2a cell lines. Using a simple and reliable reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the amount of 3-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) in the BSE was found to be 18.5% w/w. The results confirmed that BSE and AKBA, at concentrations as high as 100 μg/mL or 10 μM, respectively, caused no significant cytotoxicity or apoptotic cell death. Co- and pretreatment with BSE (25-100 μg/mL) or AKBA (5 μM) restored the viability of PC12 and N2a cells under glutamate toxicity (8 mM). Treatment with BSE and AKBA also attenuated the toxic effects of glutamate on intracellular reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase activity, and oxidative DNA damage compared with the untreated glutamate-injured cells. Furthermore, BSE and AKBA decreased the apoptotic cell population in the sub-G1 region and the rate of both early and late-stage apoptosis induced by glutamate in the cells. Our data suggest that the protective effects of Boswellia extract and AKBA against glutamate toxicity in PC12 and N2a cells may be mediated through the amelioration of the oxidative stress and the resultant apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30159408>Current state of phenolic and terpenoidal dietary factors and natural products as non-coding RNA/microRNA modulators for improved cancer therapy and prevention.</a></h2><p>The epigenetic regulation of cancer cells by small non-coding RNA molecules, the microRNAs (miRNAs), has raised particular interest in the field of oncology. These miRNAs play crucial roles concerning pathogenic properties of cancer cells and the sensitivity of cancer cells towards anticancer drugs. Certain miRNAs are responsible for an enhanced activity of drugs, while others lead to the formation of tumor resistance. In addition, miRNAs regulate survival and proliferation of cancer cells, in particular of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), that are especially drug-resistant and, thus, cause tumor relapse in many cases. Various small molecule compounds were discovered that target miRNAs that are known to modulate tumor aggressiveness and drug resistance. This review comprises the effects of naturally occurring small molecules (phenolic compounds and terpenoids) on miRNAs involved in cancer diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25913458>Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid reduces retinal angiogenesis in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy.</a></h2><p>Retinal diseases characterized by pathologic retinal angiogenesis are the leading causes of blindness worldwide. Although therapies directed toward vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) represent a significant step forward in the treatment of proliferative retinopathies, further improvements are needed. In the last few years, an intense research activity has focused around the use of herbal and traditional natural medicines as an alternative for slowing down the progression of proliferative retinopathies. In the present study, we investigated the antiangiogenic effects of acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), one of the active principles derived from the plant Boswellia serrata, used in Ayurvedic systems of medicine. We studied the antiangiogenic properties of AKBA using the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), which mimics the neovascular response seen in human retinopathy of prematurity. We first evaluated the effects of subcutaneously administered AKBA on the expression/activity of proteins which are known to play a role in the OIR model. In the retina, AKBA increased expression and activity of Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase 1 and reduced the phosphorylation of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as well as VEGF expression and VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 phosphorylation. Likely as a result of these effects, AKBA significantly reduced retinal neovascularization in OIR mice without affecting retinal cell survival and retinal function. Using retinal explants cultured in hypoxia and an activator of STAT3 phosphorylation, we showed that the AKBA-induced inhibition of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation is likely to be mediated by a mechanism depending on an SHP-1/STAT3/VEGF axis. In the OIR model, neovascularization results from the activation of retinal endothelial cells, therefore we evaluated whether AKBA affected the angiogenic response of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs). We observed that AKBA reduced proliferation, migration and tube formation in HRMECs stimulated with exogenous VEGF, while it reduced migration and tube formation in untreated HRMECs. Taken together, our results demonstrate the antiangiogenic effects of AKBA in a model of pathologic neovascularization, providing a rationale for further investigation of AKBA as a promising therapeutic agent to reduce the impact of proliferative retinopathies.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Cerebral ischemia is a major cause of endothelial dysfunction which can disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)/reperfusion promote cell death and BBB breakdown in brain endothelial cells. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), a biologically active phytoconstituent of the medicinal plant Boswellia serrata, has been shown to be protective against various inflammatory diseases as well as ischemic brain injury. The molecular mechanisms underlying these beneficial characteristics of AKBA are poorly understood. We subjected bEND.3 cells to OGD/reperfusion to investigate the protective role of AKBA in this model. We found that AKBA treatment attenuated endothelial cell death and oxidative stress assessed by means of TUNEL assay, cleaved-caspase-3, and dihydroethidium (DHE) staining. Furthermore, OGD downregulated  proteins ZO-1 and Occludin levels, and increased the expressions of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, ICAM-1, and complement C3a receptor (C3aR). We also noticed the increased phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 in bEND.3 cells in OGD group. AKBA treatment significantly attenuated expression levels of these inflammatory proteins and prevented the degradation of ZO-1 and Occludin following OGD. In conclusion, AKBA treatment provides protection against endothelial cell dysfunction following OGD by attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28142143>Nrf2- and Bach1 May Play a Role in the Modulation of Ultraviolet A-Induced Oxidative Stress by Acetyl-11-Keto-β-Boswellic Acid in Skin Keratinocytes.</a></h2><p>Exposure of human skin to solar ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation causes severe oxidative stress with damage to various cellular components and concomitant inflammation and carcinogenesis.The aim of this study is to investigate the protective effect of acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) against UVA radiation on human skin keratinocytes.HaCaT cells were pretreated with AKBA followed by UVA irradiation. Radiation effects on cell morphology, cell viability, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and antioxidant enzymes were examined.AKBA reduces UVA irradiation-induced cell viability loss, accompanied by a decreased production of UVA-induced ROS, decreased malondialdehyde, and increased superoxide dismutase expression. In addition, AKBA increased basal and UVA-induced levels of Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2), the redox-sensitive factor, and its target genes NQO1 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), whereas expression of the transcriptional repressor Bach1 (BTB and CNC homology 1) was reduced. Furthermore, the cytoprotective effects of AKBA against UVA-derived oxidative damage were accompanied by modulating expression of inflammatory mediators (i.e., cyclooxygenase-2 and nuclear factor-κB) and NOX1.AKBA protects skin cells from UVA-induced damage by modulating inflammatory mediators and/or ROS production. Therefore, AKBA has potential in the development of skin care products.© 2017 S.

Meanwhile complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is increasing, particularly herbal medicine. Boswellia serrata is a traditional Ayurvedic remedy with anti- properties, of interest for its usefulness in IBDs. The mechanism of this pharmacological potential of Boswellia serrata was investigated in colonic epithelial cell monolayers exposed to H2O2 or INF-γ+TNF-α, chosen as in vitro experimental model of intestinal inflammation. The barrier function was evaluated by the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and paracellular permeability assay, and by the tight junction proteins (zonula occludens-1, ZO-1 and occludin) immunofluorescence. The expression of phosphorylated NF-κB and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were determined by immunoblot and cytofluorimetric assay, respectively. Boswellia serrata oleo-gum extract (BSE) and its pure derivative acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), were tested at 0.1-10 μg/ml and 0.027 μg/ml, respectively. BSE and AKBA safety was demonstrated by no alteration of intestinal cell viability and barrier function and integrity biomarkers. H2O2 or INF-γ+TNF-α treatment of Caco-2 cell monolayers significantly reduced TEER, increased paracellular permeability and caused the disassembly of tight junction proteins occludin and ZO-1. BSE and AKBA pretreatment significantly prevented functional and morphological alterations and also the NF-κB phosphorylation induced by the  stimuli. At the same concentrations BSE and AKBA counteracted the increase of ROS caused by H2O2 exposure. Data showed the positive correlation of the antioxidant activity with the mechanism involved in the physiologic maintenance of the integrity and function of the intestinal epithelium. This study elucidates the pharmacological mechanisms mediated by BSE, in protecting intestinal epithelial barrier from  damage and supports its use as safe adjuvant in patients affected by IBD.</p></html>
