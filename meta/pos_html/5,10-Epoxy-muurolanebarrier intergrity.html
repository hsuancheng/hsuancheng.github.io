The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of diets supplemented with cooked red lentils on the colonic microenvironment (microbiota composition and activity and epithelial   and function). C57Bl/6 male mice were fed one of five diets: a control basal diet (BD), a BD-supplemented diet with , 10 or 20% cooked red lentils (by weight), or a BD-supplemented diet with 0.7% pectin (equivalent soluble fiber level as found in the 20% lentil diet). Red lentil supplementation resulted in increased: (1) fecal microbiota α-diversity; (2) abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria (e.g.,  and ); (3) concentrations of fecal SCFAs; (4) mRNA expression of SCFA receptors (G-protein-coupled receptors () and tight/adherens junction proteins (Zona Occulden-1 (), Claudin-2, E-cadherin). Overall, 20% lentil had the greatest impact on colon health outcomes, which were in part explained by a change in the soluble and insoluble fiber profile of the diet. These results support recent public health recommendations to increase consumption of plant-based protein foods for improved health, in particular intestinal health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30904470>Targets, Treatments, and Outcomes Updates in Diabetic Stroke.</a></h1><p>Due to multiple failures to translate basic research, the need for novel therapeutic targets and strategies is still urgent to save a larger number of the stroke patients' population and to reduce the toxicity of the current stroke therapy.We summarize the most recent, within past  years, basic and clinical diabetic stroke research findings.We aim to examine the most current understanding of stroke and neurovascular unit , especially in presence of hyperglycemia and/or diabetes mellitus. From there, we are comparing the meaningful findings that aim at treating diabetic stroke to see where they differ, where they succeed, and where they open questions for new therapeutic strategies.The need for more clinically effective neuroprotective strategies is still mismatched with the bench side findings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) within a therapeutic time window of 4. h after stroke onset constitutes the only existing treatment. Beyond this time window, rtPA worsens BBB breakdown. Canonical Wnt pathway induces BBB formation and maturation during ontogeny. We hypothesized that the pathway is required to maintain BBB functions after stroke; thus, its activation might improve rtPA therapy. Therefore, we first assessed pathway activity in the brain of mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Next, we evaluated the effect of pathway deactivation early after stroke onset on BBB functions. Finally, we assessed the impact of pathway activation on BBB breakdown associated to delayed administration of rtPA. Our results show that pathway activity is induced predominately in endothelial cells early after ischemic stroke. Early deactivation of the pathway using a potent inhibitor, XAV939, aggravates BBB breakdown and increases hemorrhagic transformation incidence. On the other hand, pathway activation using a potent activator, 6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (6-BIO), reduces the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation associated to delayed rtPA administration by attenuating BBB breakdown via promotion of tight junction formation and repressing endothelial basal permeability independently of rtPA proteolytic activity. BBB preservation upon pathway activation limited the deleterious effects of delayed rtPA administration. Our study demonstrates that activation of the canonical Wnt pathway constitutes a clinically relevant strategy to extend the therapeutic time window of rtPA by attenuating BBB breakdown via regulation of BBB-specific mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430854>Electrical Stimulation of the Mesencephalic Locomotor Region Has No Impact on Blood-Brain  Alterations after Cerebral Photothrombosis in Rats.</a></h1><p>Blood-brain  (BBB) disruption is a critical event after ischemic stroke, which results in edema formation and hemorrhagic transformation of infarcted tissue. BBB dysfunction following stroke is partly mediated by proinflammatory agents. We recently have shown that high frequency stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR-HFS) exerts an antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory effect in the border zone of cerebral photothrombotic stroke in rats. Whether MLR-HFS also has an impact on BBB dysfunction in the early stage of stroke is unknown. In this study, rats were subjected to photothrombotic stroke of the sensorimotor cortex and implantation of a stimulating microelectrode into the ipsilesional MLR. Thereafter, either HFS or sham stimulation of the MLR was applied for 24 h. After scarifying the rats, BBB disruption was assessed by determining albumin extravasation and tight junction  (claudin 3, claudin , and occludin) using Western blot analyses and immunohistochemistry. In addition, by applying zymography, expression of pro-metalloproteinase-9 (pro-MMP-9) was analyzed. No differences were found regarding infarct size and BBB dysfunction between stimulated and unstimulated animals 24 h after induction of stroke. Our results indicate that MLR-HFS neither improves nor worsens the damaged BBB after stroke. Attenuating cytokines/chemokines in the perilesional area, as mediated by MLR-HFS, tend to play a less significant role in preventing the BBB .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056700>Fecal Proteases from Pouchitis Patients Activate Protease Activating Receptor-2 to Disrupt the Epithelial .</a></h1><p>The pathogenesis of pouch inflammation may involve epithelial  disruption. We investigated whether fecal proteolytic activity is increased during pouchitis and results in epithelial  dysfunction through protease activating receptor (PAR) activation, and assessed whether the intestinal microbiome may be the source of the proteases.Fecal samples were measured for protease activity using a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-casein florescence assay. Caco-2 cell monolayers were exposed to fecal supernatants to assess permeability to FITC-dextran. Tight junction protein  and PAR activation were assessed by immunoblot and immunofluorescence. A truncated PAR2 protein in Caco-2 cells was achieved by stable transfection using CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid. PAR2 activation in pouch biopsies was examined using antibodies directed to the N-terminus of the protein. Microbial composition was analyzed using Illumina MiSeq platform of the 16S rRNA gene.Ten pouchitis patients, 6 normal pouch (NP) patients and 9 healthy controls (HC) were recruited. The pouchitis patients exhibited a .19- and .35-fold higher fecal protease (FP) activity (p ≤ 0.05) compared to the NP and HC participants, respectively. The Haemophilus species was positively associated with FP activity (R=0.718, FDR<0.1).Fecal supernatants from pouchitis patients activated PAR2 on Caco-2 monolayers, disrupted TJ proteins, and increased epithelial permeability. PAR2 truncation in Caco-2 abrogated fecal protease-mediated permeability. Pouch biopsies obtained from pouchitis patients, but not from NP patients, displayed PAR2 activation.Protease-producing bacteria may increase fecal proteolytic activity that results in pouch inflammation through disruption of TJ proteins and increased epithelial permeability in a PAR2-dependent manner. This mechanism may initiate or propagate pouch inflammation.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Here, we investigated whether the probiotic  Zhengchangsheng (BL) ameliorates dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis through alteration of the gut microbiota. Experimental colitis was induced in BALB/C mice by dissolving 3% DSS in their drinking water for 7 days, which were gavaged with 0.2 ml phosphate-buffered saline or BL (3×10 cfu/ml) once a day. Administration of BL attenuated several effects of DSS-induced colitis, including weight loss, increased disease activity index, and disrupted intestinal  . In addition, BL mitigated the reduction in faecal microbiota richness in DSS treated mice. Interestingly, BL was found to reduce the elevated circulating endotoxin level in mice with colitis by modulating the microbial composition of the microbiota, and this was highly associated with a proportional decrease in gut . Our results demonstrate that BL can attenuate DSS-induced colitis and provide valuable insight into microbiota interactions during IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572482>Effect of  N1115 and fructooligosaccharides in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing health concern worldwide. Administration of probiotics and prebiotics has been proposed as a convenient and effective treatment. Our study aims to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of  N1115 (N1115) and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) by examining the histopathogenesis and underlying molecular events of NAFLD.An NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding C57BL/6 mice with a high-fat diet (HFD). N1115, FOS and synbiotics were administered for 16 weeks.N1115, FOS and synbiotics alleviated HFD-induced hepatic steato-sis and release of tumor necrosis factor-α, and slowed the progression of cirrhosis. Compared to the HFD group, these dietary supplements reduced serum total triglyceride and cholesterol, and appeared to decrease the fasting blood glucose and insulin. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and real-time PCR showed that the regimens could overcome insulin resistance. These findings were associated with the transcriptional repression of inflammatory factors such as lipopolysaccharides, Toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor-κB. Lastly, N1115, FOS, and synbiotics improved the intestinal  functions and histologic . This was accompanied by the restoration of the p38 MAPK pathway and in-creased expression of the tight junction components occludin-1 and claudin-1.N1115, FOS and synbiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.

The treatment of AD with bath additives remains highly debated. Recent evidence suggests that dilute apple cider vinegar (ACV) may improve skin   in AD, but its safety and efficacy are not well studied. This pilot split-arm study analyzed the effect of dilute apple cider vinegar soaks on skin   in patients with atopic dermatitis as measured by skin transepidermal water loss and skin pH.A total of 22 subjects (11 AD and 11 healthy controls) were enrolled. Subjects soaked both of their forearms for 14 days, with one arm in dilute ACV (0.% acetic acid) and the other in water 10 minutes daily. Transepidermal water loss and pH were measured pre- and post-treatment.In both groups, transepidermal water loss increased and pH decreased at 0 minutes post-ACV treatment, but these effects were not sustained at 60 minutes. In total, 72.7% (16/22) of subjects reported mild side effects from ACV with improvement after discontinuing the soaks.Dilute ACV soaks have no significant effect on skin   but caused skin irritation in a majority of subjects. Study limitations include analysis of a single brand, dilution, and application of ACV. Future studies are needed to explore whether lower concentrations of ACV soaks or other applications such as a leave-on acidic ointment could improve skin   in a safe, nonirritating way.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132127>Mixed Vehicle Emissions Induces Angiotensin II and Cerebral Microvascular Angiotensin Receptor Expression in C57Bl/6 Mice and Promotes Alterations in  in a Blood-Brain  Coculture Model.</a></h1><p>Exposure to traffic-generated pollution is associated with alterations in blood-brain  (BBB)  and exacerbation of cerebrovascular disorders. Angiotensin (Ang) II signaling through the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor is known to promote BBB disruption. We have previously reported that exposure to a mixture of gasoline and diesel vehicle engine emissions (MVE) mediates alterations in cerebral microvasculature of C57Bl/6 mice, which is exacerbated through consumption of a high-fat (HF) diet. Thus, we investigated the hypothesis that inhalation exposure to MVE results in altered central nervous system microvascular  mediated by Ang II-AT1 signaling. Three-month-old male C57Bl/6 mice were placed on an HF or low-fat diet and exposed via inhalation to either filtered air (FA) or MVE (100 μg/m3 PM) 6 h/d for 30 days. Exposure to HF+MVE resulted in a significant increase in plasma Ang II and expression of AT1 in the cerebral microvasculature. Results from a BBB coculture study showed that transendothelial electrical resistance was decreased, associated with reduced expression of claudin- and occludin when treated with plasma from MVE+HF animals. These effects were attenuated through pretreatment with the AT1 antagonist, Losartan. Our BBB coculture showed increased levels of astrocyte AT1 and decreased expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor and glutathione peroxidase-1, associated with increased interleukin-6 and transforming growth factor-β in the astrocyte media, when treated with plasma from MVE-exposed groups. Our results indicate that inhalation exposure to traffic-generated pollutants results in altered BBB , mediated through Ang II-AT1 signaling and inflammation, which is exacerbated by an HF diet.© The Author(s) 2019.

Yu-Ping-Feng-San (YPFS), a well-known Chinese herbal decoction, reduces the AD relapse rate and recurring severity incidence. However, the underlying mechanism of YPFS on resisting AD recurrence is still unknown and further study is needed.To evaluate the effects of YPFS on recurrent allergic inflammation of AD in a murine model and to investigate the underlying mechanisms in vivo and ex vivo.A fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-induced AD relapsing mouse model was established to study the effects of YPFS and three active components, claycosin, formononetin, and cimifugin, on recurrent allergic inflammation in vivo. Histological analyses of ear tissue inflammation were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Production of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-, IL-13, and interferon-gamma in mice ear tissues, IgE in serum, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in cell cultures were measured by ELISAs. Tight junction (TJ) expression was detected by immunohistochemistry and western blots. Epithelial   was observed with electron microscopy, transepithelial electric resistance (TER), and paracellular flux measurements. HaCaT cells were utilized for ex vivo cellular analyses.In the recurrent phase of AD, YPFS exhibited both short- and long-term anti-allergic inflammatory efficacy with reduced ear tissue inflammation and decreased IL-4, IL-, IL-13, and IgE production. The three active components, claycosin, formononetin, and cimifugin, showed similar effects as YPFS. Stimulus-induced decreased TER and increased FITC-dextran flux in air-liquid interface cultures of HaCaT cells were significantly repaired by YPFS and the three active components. Notably, the upregulated TJ (CLDN-1 and occludin) expression of epithelium was observed only with YPFS and the three components-treated mice as opposed to the result using conventional anti-allergy medicines. Restored TJ expression by YPFS three components was also detectable in the remission phase of AD. Moreover, decreased TJ expression influenced the effects of YPFS on epithelial cells-derived TSLP production.YPFS ameliorated recurrent allergic inflammation of AD by repairing TJ defects of epithelial barriers. Intervening epithelial  functions could be a preventive and therapeutic approach for recurrent allergic inflammation of AD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

The findings from our retrospective study, supported by previous clinical reports, showed that increasing age is an early predictor for developing fatal infectious complications after stroke. However, exactly how and why older individuals are more susceptible to infection after stroke remains unclear. Using a mouse model of transient ischaemic stroke, we demonstrate that older mice (>12 months) present with greater spontaneous bacterial lung infections compared to their younger counterparts (7-10 weeks) after stroke. Importantly, we provide evidence that older poststroke mice exhibited elevated intestinal inflammation and disruption in gut barriers critical in maintaining colonic  following stroke, including reduced expression of mucin and tight junction proteins. In addition, our data support the notion that the localized pro-inflammatory microenvironment driven by increased tumour necrosis factor-α production in the colon of older mice facilitates the translocation and dissemination of orally inoculated bacteria to the lung following stroke onset. Therefore, findings of this study demonstrate that exacerbated dysfunction of the intestinal  in advanced age promotes translocation of gut-derived bacteria and contributes to the increased risk to poststroke bacterial infection.© 2019 The Authors.

Gut and liver are closely connected and communicate via the portal vein and the biliary system so the liver is constantly exposed to gut-derived bacterial products and metabolites. The intestinal  is important for maintaining physical and functional separation between microbes in the gut and the interior of the host and disruption of the  function can lead to bacterial translocation and increased leakage of bacterial metabolites. Liver diseases have been associated with dysbiotic changes in the gut microbiota and impaired gut  , thus a future strategy to treat liver disease may be to target the gut microbiota and thereby restore the gut  function.

However, this protective function is the major hurdle for treating brain diseases such as brain tumors, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, etc. It was previously demonstrated that high pulsed electrical fields (PEFs) can disrupt the BBB by inducing electroporation (EP) which increases the permeability of the transcellular route. Our goal was to study the effects of low PEFs, well below the threshold of EP on the  and function of the BBB. Ten low voltage pulses (-100 V) were applied to a human in vitro BBB model. Changes in permeability to small molecules (NaF) were studied as well as changes in impedance spectrum and trans-endothelial electric resistivity. Viability and EP were evaluated by Presto-Blue and endogenous Lactate dehydrogenase release assays. The effect on tight junction and adherent junction protein was also studied. The results of low voltage experiments were compared to high voltage experiments (200-1400 V). A significant increase in permeability was found at voltages as low as 10 V despite EP only occurring from 100 V. The changes in permeability as a function of applied voltage were fitted to an inverse-exponential function, suggesting a plateau effect. Staining of VE-cadherin showed specific changes in protein expression. The results indicate that low PEFs can transiently disrupt the BBB by affecting the paracellular route, although the mechanism remains unclear.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474191>Anti-IFNAR treatment does not reverse neuropsychiatric disease in MRL/ lupus mice.</a></h1><p>Many systemic lupus erythematosus patients display a type I interferon (IFN) signature, and IFNα levels positively correlate with disease severity. Previous studies blocking the type I IFN pathway systemically in lupus models showed some beneficial effects. However, its effects on neuropsychiatric manifestations have yet to be carefully assessed, even though IFNα has been associated with induction of depression.

State-of-the-art therapeutic approaches focus on alleviating the symptoms of this disease by non-invasive and simple-to-use methods. Nasal irrigation is one of the most accepted approaches to ease nasal congestion which, if left untreated, has a negative impact on the quality of life of patients.In this study, the safety and efficacy of a novel hypertonic seawater solution for nasal lavage enriched with hyaluronic acids, eucalyptus oil, copper, and manganese salts (Stérimar Stop & Protect Cold and Flu; SSPCF) have been investigated in vitro.An in vitro 3D reconstituted human nasal epithelium tissue model, MucilAir™, has been used in this study to investigate the safety of SSPCF on nasal epithelium by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion. The efficacy of SSPCF was measured by mucociliary clearance (MCC), ATP release, Alcian blue and aquaporin (AQP3) stainings.SSPCF treatment respected nasal epithelium tissue  and enhanced  function without inducing a cytotoxic response. Secreted LDH and IL-8 levels were similar to untreated controls. MCC rate was increased 2.-fold and ATP release decreased 87% upon SSPCF treatment, indicating improved decongestion activity. SSPCF treatment after hypotonic stress helped recover cellular organization, as shown by Alcian blue and AQP3 staining assays.SSPCF appears as a safe and effective nasal irrigation formula that may alleviate the symptoms associated with common cold such as nasal congestion.© 2019 Huang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30814927>Restraint Stress Induced Hyperpermeability and Damage of the Blood-Brain  in the Amygdala of Adult Rats.</a></h1><p>Intense or prolonged exposure to stress can damage various brain structures, including the amygdala and hippocampus, which are associated with emotional-cognitive functions. Furthermore, this deterioration has been linked to a myriad of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, in particular through disruption of the blood-brain  (BBB). However, insights remain scarce concerning the effects and mechanisms associated with stress on the BBB in the amygdala. This study explored the effects of restraint stress on the permeability and  of the BBB in the amygdala of male adult SD rats. Serum levels of corticosterone (CORT) and S100B were determined through ELISA. The permeability of the BBB was assessed by measuring Evans Blue (EB) leakage in tissue samples from the rats' amygdala. These samples were immunostained for markers of tight junctions (Claudin-, Occludin, ZO-1) and adherens junctions (VE-cadherin), as well as GLUT-1 and AQP-4. Staining was evaluated through confocal microscopy, and the level of expression of these proteins was quantified using the Western Blot (WB) technique. The ultrastructure of brain microvascular endothelial cells was assessed with transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) content in serum and amygdalar tissues were determined by employing ELISA. Exposure to restraint stress was associated with higher serum levels of S100B and EB leakage in amygdala tissues, especially in days 14 and 21 of the experiment, indicating increased permeability of the BBB. After restraint stress, significant decreases in protein expression were detected for tight junctions, adherens junctions and GLUT-1, while a significant increase was observed for AQP-4. The variation trends of fluorescence intensity generally paralleled these results. Following restraint stress, transmission electron microscopy ascertained enlarged gaps in tight junctions and thickened basal membranes in amygdalar capillaries. In addition, increased IL-1β contents in serum and amygdalar tissues were observed in the restraint-stressed groups. These findings suggest that restraint stress mediates time-dependent alterations in the permeability of the BBB, with modifications in the expression of proteins from tight junctions and adherens junctions, as well as ultrastructural changes in brain microvascular endothelial cells. And it was associated with the inflammation. These alterations may be associated with behavioral and cognitive dysfunctions and neurodegenerative disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30723947>Three-Dimensional Graphene/Ag Aerogel for Durable and Stable Li Metal Anodes in Carbonate-Based Electrolytes.</a></h1><p>The use of Li metal as the anode for Li-based batteries has attracted considerable attention due to its ultrahigh energy density. However, the formation of Li dendrites, uneven deposition, and huge volume changes hinder its reliable implementation. These issues become much more severe in commercial carbonate-based electrolytes than in ether-based electrolytes. Herein, a rationally designed three-dimensional graphene/Ag aerogel (3D G-Ag aerogel) is proposed for Li metal anodes with long cycle life in carbonate-based electrolytes. The modified lithiophilic nature of G-Ag aerogel, realized through decoration with Ag NPs, effectively decreases the energy  for Li nucleation, regulating uniform Li deposition behavior. Moreover, the highly flexible, conductive 3D porous architecture with hierarchical mesopores and macropores can readily accommodate deposited Li and ensures the  of the conductive network during cycling. Consequently, high coulombic efficiency (over 93. %) and a significantly long cycle life (1589 h) over 200 cycles, with a relatively high cycling capacity of 2.0 mAh cm , can easily be achieved, even in a carbonate-based electrolyte. Considering the intrinsic high voltage windows of carbonate-based electrolytes, matching the G-Ag aerogel Li metal anode with a high-voltage cathode can be envisaged for the fabrication of high-energy-density Li secondary batteries.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Transendothelial/epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) then was measured and the distribution of the tight junction protein ZO-1 was assessed by immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy.Treatment with IL-6 for 48 hours significantly increased the diffusion rate of FITC-dextran, decreased TEER, and disrupted the distribution of ZO-1 in ARPE-19 cells, which constitutively express the IL-6 transmembrane receptor, and this was reversed with IL-6R blockade. In contrast, IL-6 did not affect the paracellular permeability, TEER, or ZO-1 distribution in HRMECs.These in vitro data support the hypothesis that IL-6 reversibly disrupts the  of ARPE-19 cells, but it does not affect HRMECs.IL-6 is a candidate therapeutic target in the treatment of outer BRB driven ME.Copyright 2019 The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30760300>Therapeutic hypercapnia reduces blood-brain  damage possibly via protein kinase Cε in rats with lateral fluid percussion injury.</a></h1><p>This study investigated whether therapeutic hypercapnia (TH) ameliorated blood-brain  (BBB) damage and improved the neurologic outcome in a rat model of lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI), and explored the possible underlying mechanism.Rats underwent lateral FPI and received inhalation of 30%O-70%N or 30%O-N plus CO to maintain arterial blood CO tension (PaCO) between 80 and 100 mmHg for 3 h. To further explore the possible mechanisms for the protective effects of TH, a PKC inhibitor staurosporine or PKCαβ inhibitor GÖ6976 was administered via intracerebral ventricular injection.TH significantly improved neurological function 24 h, 48 h, 7 d, and 14 d after FPI. The wet/dry ratio, computed tomography values, Evans blue content, and histological lesion volume were significantly reduced by TH. Moreover, numbers of survived neurons and the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-) were significantly elevated after TH treatment at 48-h post-FPI. TH significantly increased the expression of protein kinase Cε (PKCε) at 48-h post-FPI, but did not significantly change the expression of PKCα and PKCβII. PKC inhibitor staurosporine (but not the selective PKCαβ inhibitor-GÖ6976) inhibited the protective effect of TH.Therapeutic hypercapnia is a promising candidate that should be further evaluated for clinical treatment. It not only protects the traumatic penumbra from secondary injury and improves histological structure but also maintains the  of BBB and reduces neurologic deficits after trauma in a rat model of FPI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734989>Effects of exercise training on multiple sclerosis biomarkers of central nervous system and disease status: a systematic review of intervention studies.</a></h1><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that can be tracked through biomarkers of disease status. We investigated the effects of exercise on MS biomarkers associated with CNS status including imaging, blood-brain  (BBB) function and neurotrophic factors.We conducted open-dated searches of Scopus, Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. We included studies written in English describing interventions of exercise that measured one or more of the biomarkers associated with MS published up to October 2018.We located a total of 3012 citations through searches in electronic databases. Of these, 16 studies were eligible for review; six studies focused on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers, nine studies focused on neurotrophic factors and three studies focused on BBB function markers. It is of note that two studies included both neurotrophic factor and BBB function markers and are therefore included across categories of biomarkers in this review. The existing evidence from MRI studies confirmed that exercise training can improve CNS  and function. There is evidence of a positive effect of exercise training on modulation of BBB permeability markers and brain-derived neurotrophic factor.Exercise successfully improves MRI outcomes and peripheral biomarkers (i.e. brain-derived neurotrophic factor) in people with MS. This suggests that exercise can be recommended as an adjuvant therapy for MS treatment. This conclusion is tempered by some methodological limitations including small sample sizes and high drop-out rates in the reviewed studies.© 2019 EAN.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691500>Claudin-: gatekeeper of neurological function.</a></h1><p>Tight junction proteins of the blood-brain  are vital for maintaining  of endothelial cells lining brain blood vessels. The presence of these protein complexes in the space between endothelial cells creates a dynamic, highly regulated and restrictive microenvironment that is vital for neural homeostasis. By limiting paracellular diffusion of material between blood and brain, tight junction proteins provide a protective  preventing the passage of unwanted and potentially damaging material. Simultaneously, this protective  hinders the therapeutic effectiveness of central nervous system acting drugs with over 95% of small molecule therapeutics unable to bypass the blood-brain . At the blood-brain , claudin- is the most enriched tight junction protein and its dysfunction has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, neuroinflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis as well as psychiatric disorders including depression and schizophrenia. By regulating levels of claudin-, it is possible to abrogate disease symptoms in many of these disorders. This review will give an overview of the blood-brain  and the role of tight junction complexes in maintaining blood-brain   before focusing on the role of claudin- and its regulation in homeostatic and pathological conditions. We will also summarise therapeutic strategies to restore  of cerebral vessels by targeting tight junction protein complexes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191328>Fetal Growth Restriction Alters Cerebellar Development in Fetal and Neonatal Sheep.</a></h1><p>Fetal growth restriction (FGR) complicates -10% of pregnancies and is associated with increased risks of perinatal morbidity and mortality. The development of cerebellar neuropathology , in response to chronic fetal hypoxia, and over the period of high risk for preterm birth, has not been previously studied. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the effects of FGR induced by placental insufficiency on cerebellar development at three timepoints in ovine fetal and neonatal development: (1) 115 days gestational age (d GA), (2) 124 d GA, and (3) 1-day-old postnatal age. We induced FGR  single umbilical artery ligation (SUAL) at ~105 d GA in fetal sheep, term is ~147 d GA. Animals were sacrificed at 115 d GA, 124 d GA, and 1-day-old postnatal age; fetuses and lambs were weighed and the cerebellum collected for histopathology. FGR lambs demonstrated neuropathology within the cerebellum after birth, with a significant, ~18% decrease in the number of granule cell bodies (NeuN+ immunoreactivity) within the internal granular layer (IGL) and an ~80% reduction in neuronal extension and branching (MAP+ immunoreactivity) within the molecular layer (ML). Oxidative stress (8-OHdG+ immunoreactivity) was significantly higher in FGR lambs within the ML and the white matter (WM) compared to control lambs. The structural  of neurons was already aberrant in the FGR cerebellum at 115 d GA, and by 124 d GA, inflammatory cells (Iba-1+ immunoreactivity) were significantly upregulated and the blood-brain  (BBB) was compromised (Pearls, albumin, and GFAP+ immunoreactivity). We confirm that cerebellar injuries develop antenatally in FGR, and therefore, interventions to prevent long-term motor and coordination deficits should be implemented either antenatally or perinatally, thereby targeting neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595193>The Drainage of Interstitial Fluid in the Deep Brain is Controlled by the  of Myelination.</a></h1><p>In searching for the drainage route of the interstitial fluid (ISF) in the deep brain, we discovered a regionalized ISF drainage system as well as a new function of myelin in regulating the drainage. The traced ISF from the caudate nucleus drained to the ipsilateral cortex along myelin fiber tracts, while in the opposite direction, its movement to the adjacent thalamus was completely impeded by a  structure, which was identified as the converged, compact myelin fascicle. The regulating and the  effects of myelin were unchanged in AQP4-knockout rats but were impaired as the  of boundary structure of drainage system was destroyed in a demyelinated rat model. We thus proposed that the brain homeostasis was maintained within each ISF drainage division locally, rather than across the brain as a whole. A new brain division system and a new pathogenic mechanism of demyelination are therefore proposed.Copyright: © 2019 Wang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30964190>Therapeutic effect of dexmedetomidine on intracerebral hemorrhage via regulating NLRP3.</a></h1><p>To investigate the protective effect of dexmedetomidine on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) mice and the underlying mechanism.The in vivo ICH model was induced by the injection of autologous blood in C57BL/6 mice. Mice were randomly assigned into control group (no specific treatment) and treatment group (dexmedetomidine administration). Mouse neuronal deficits were evaluated by modified neurological severity scores (mNSS) and Corner Turn Test. ICH volume and cerebral edema at the hemisphere of lesions were determined. Inflammatory response at post-ICH was examined by flow cytometry and quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). The  and permeability of blood brain  (BBB) were detected by Western blot and Evans Blue extravasation.Dexmedetomidine treatment markedly alleviated the clinical symptoms of ICH mice, and decreased ICH volume and cerebral edema. QRT-PCR data revealed down-regulated levels of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, and IL-1β in mice of the treatment group relative to controls. Moreover, dexmedetomidine administration decreased contents of CD11b+CD45int, IL-6, and IL-1β, but elevated TGF-β content in treatment group. The Evans Blue leakage was reduced in mice of the treatment group. Both protein and mRNA levels of Claudin- and ZO-1 were upregulated in the treatment group.Dexmedetomidine remarkably inhibits the activation of inflammasome, alleviates secondary cerebral injury and inflammation, and protects the  and permeability of BBB at post-ICH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581125>Bioactive fragments of laminin and collagen chains - Lesson from the testis.</a></h1><p>Recent studies have shown that the testis is producing several biologically active peptides, namely the F5- and the NC1-peptides from laminin-γ3 and collagen α3 (IV) chain, respectively, that promotes blood-testis  (BTB) remodeling and also elongated spermatid release at spermiation. Also the LG3/4/-peptide from laminin-α2 chain also promotes BTB  which is likely being used for the assembly of a "new" BTB behind preleptotene spermatocytes under transport at the immunological .

The  of blood-brain  (BBB) is closely linked to the cerebral vascular disease. The protective effects of ligustilide, the major bioactive component in Chuanxiong rhizome, on cerebral blood vessels have been reported previously, but its effects and potential mechanism on BBB have not been entirely clarified. In the current work, the effects of ligustilide on BBB permeability and the underlying molecular mechanisms had been investigated using the model of BBB established by coculturing astrocytes and brain microvascular endothelial cells isolated from the rat brain. The ischemia-damaged model of BBB has been established with oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). Our results indicated that OGD significantly increased the permeability in the coculture BBB model. This OGD-induced increase in permeability could suppress by ligustilide in a concentration-dependent manner. Also, ligustilide promoted both gene and protein expression of tight junction proteins. Ligustilide suppressed the upregulation of HIF-1α, vascular endothelial growth factor, and AQP-4 in the BBB model induced by OGD. Collectively, all results have demonstrated that ligustilide is capable of reducing the permeability of BBB in vitro model induced by OGD through HIF-1α/vascular endothelial growth factor pathway and AQP-4, which provide a new target for the clinical application of ligustilide on BBB after stroke in future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040818>The Blood-Brain  Breakdown During Acute Phase of the Pilocarpine Model of Epilepsy Is Dynamic and Time-Dependent.</a></h1><p>The maintenance of blood-brain  (BBB)  is essential for providing a suitable environment for nervous tissue function. BBB disruption is involved in many central nervous system diseases, including epilepsy. Evidence demonstrates that BBB breakdown may induce epileptic seizures, and conversely, seizure-induced BBB disruption may cause further epileptic episodes. This study was conducted based on the premise that the impairment of brain tissue during the triggering event may determine the organization and functioning of the brain during epileptogenesis, and that BBB may have a key role in this process. Our purpose was to investigate in rats the relationship between pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE), and BBB  by determining the time course of the BBB opening and its subsequent recovery during the acute phase of the pilocarpine model. BBB  was assessed by quantitative and morphological methods, using sodium fluorescein and Evans blue (EB) dyes as markers of the increased permeability to micromolecules and macromolecules, respectively. Different time-points of the pilocarpine model were analyzed: 30 min after pilocarpine injection and then 1, , and 24 h after the SE onset. Our results show that BBB breakdown is a dynamic phenomenon and time-dependent, i.e., it happens at specific time-points of the acute phase of pilocarpine model of epilepsy, recovering in part its  afterwards. Pilocarpine-induced changes on brain tissue initially increases the BBB permeability to micromolecules, and subsequently, around  h after SE, the BBB breakdown to macromolecules occurs. After BBB breakdown, EB dye is captured by damaged cells, especially neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Although the BBB permeability to macromolecules is restored 24 h after the start of SE, the leakage of micromolecules persists and the consequences of BBB degradation are widely disseminated in the brain. Our findings reveal the existence of a temporal window of BBB dysfunction in the acute phase of the pilocarpine model that is important for the development of therapeutic strategies that could prevent the epileptogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31476608>Fish oil supplementation to a high-fat diet improves both intestinal health and the systemic obese phenotype.</a></h1><p>Impaired intestinal health characterized by a dysbiotic microbial community and a dysfunctional epithelial  contributes to host inflammation and metabolic dysfunction in obesity. Fish oil (FO)-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to improve aspects of the obese phenotype; however, their effect on obese intestinal health is unknown. This study aimed to determine the effect of dietary FO on the intestinal microenvironment, including the microbial community and epithelial , in a mouse model of high-fat diet induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed (12 weeks) either a high-fat diet (HF, 60% fat as kcal) or an isocaloric HF supplemented with Menhaden FO (.3% kcal, HF + FO). 16S rRNA sequencing was used to determine changes in fecal microbiota. Intestinal (ileum and colon) and epididymal adipose tissue RNA was used to assess biomarkers of   and inflammatory status, respectively. Serum was used to assess adipokine concentrations and insulin resistance. HF + FO diet altered the fecal microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Firmicutes and increasing the abundance of members of the Bacteroidetes phyla, as well as increasing the abundance of antiobesogenic Akkermansia muciniphila, compared to HF. Intestinal epithelial  functions were improved by HF + FO evidenced by increased mRNA expression of tight junction components, antimicrobial defenses and mucus  components. HF + FO-fed mice exhibited improvements in homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, oral glucose tolerance and serum adipokine concentrations and epididymal mRNA expression (increased adiponectin and decreased leptin) versus HF. HF + FO improved obese intestinal health and attenuated metabolic dysfunction associated with obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies have addressed ITN ownership, insecticide resistance, and frequency of ITN use as possible contributing factors to the high prevalence of malaria infection despite high ITN coverage, but have rarely considered whether the condition of the ITN, or how many people use it, impacts efficacy. This study assessed how ITN , ITN age, and the number of persons sharing a net might mitigate or reduce protective efficacy among self-identified ITN users in Malawi.From 2012 to 2014, six cross-sectional surveys were conducted in both the rainy and dry seasons in southern Malawi. Data were collected on ITN use,  (number and size of holes), and age. Blood samples for detecting Plasmodium falciparum infection were obtained from reported ITN users over 6 months of age. Generalized linear mixed models were used to account for clustering at the household and community level. The final model controlled for gender, household eaves, and community-level infection prevalence during the rainy season.There were 9646 ITN users with blood samples across six surveys, 15% of whom tested positive for P. falciparum infection. Among children under  years old, there was a 50% increased odds of P. falciparum infection among those sleeping under an ITN older than two years, compared to those using an ITN less than 2 years old (OR = 1.50; 95% CI 1.07-2.08). ITN  and number of individuals sharing an ITN were not associated with P. falciparum infection.Older ITNs were associated with higher rates of P. falciparum in young children, which may indicate that insecticide concentrations play a larger role in infection prevention than the physical  of an ITN. ITN use was self-reported and the  measures lacked the precision of newer methods, suggesting a need for objective measures of ITN use and more precise assessment of ITN .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853894>Omi/HtrA2 Protease Associated Cell Apoptosis Participates in Blood-Brain  Dysfunction.</a></h1><p>: Omi/HtrA2 is a proapoptotic mitochondrial serine protease involved in caspase-dependent cell apoptosis, translocating from mitochondria to the cytosol after an apoptotic insult. Our previous study indicated pre-treatment with UCF-101, a specific inhibitor of Omi/HtrA2, could significantly reduce neuronal apoptosis and attenuate sepsis-induced cognitive dysfunction. Various hypotheses involving blood-brain- (BBB) disruption have been proposed to account for sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). Here, we attempted to explore whether interference of Omi/HtrA2 by RNA interference or UCF-101 pre-treatment can improve sepsis-induced disruption of BBB using human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3)  and if so, to explore mechanisms involved Omi/HtrA2 protease mediates BBB disruption in SAE. : hCMEC/D3 cell monolayers were intervened by different concentrations of LPS (0-50 μg/mL) over experimental period. Pharmacological or gene interventions (by silencing RNA of Omi/HtrA2) were used to study molecular mechanisms involved in sepsis-associated Omi/HtrA2 translocation, cell apoptosis and BBB dysfunction. BBB function was assessed by trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and permeability to labeled dextrans (FITC-4kDa). Tight junction (TJ)  was assessed by immunofluorescence, western blotting and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analyses. Apoptosis was determined using flow cytometry and TUNEL assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and oxidative stress were also investigated. : LPS affects hCMEC/D3 TJ permeability in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. LPS intervention resulted in a significant disruption of BBB, as manifested by decreased TEER (by ~26%) and a parallel increased paracellular permeability to FITC- (4kDa) dextrans through hCMEC/D3 monolayers. The inhibition of Omi/HtrA2 by UCF-101 or Omi/HtrA2 shRNA reduced LPS-induced brain endothelial cell apoptosis, and resulted in significant improvement on LPS-induced BBB disruption as well as decreased occludin, claudin- and ZO-1 expressions. Omi/HtrA2 manipulated endothelial cell apoptosis by shifting into cytosol and inducing X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) degradation. UCF-101 administration or Omi/HtrA2 shRNA intervention did attenuate the degradation of XIAP, Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and caspase-3 cleavage. However, only UCF-101 partly prevented the mobilization of Omi/HtrA2 from the mitochondria to the cytosol after LPS intervention. That abrogation of Omi/HtrA2 by UCF-101 or Omi/HtrA2 shRNA resulted in a significant improvement on LPS-induced decrease of MMP. Oxidative stress was significantly increased in the LPS treated group compared to the control or NC-shRNA group. However, abrogation of Omi/HtrA2 by UCF-101 or Omi/HtrA2 shRNA did not significantly improve oxidative injury. : Our study indicated an important role of Omi/HtrA2 in manipulating LPS-induced cell apoptosis and BBB  by translocating from mitochondria into cytosol in brain endothelial cells. Omi/HtrA2 induced mitochondrial pathway apoptosis, which involves inhibition of an important antiapoptotic protein XIAP and influence on MMP. Therapeutic methods that inhibit Omi/HtrA2 function may provide a novel therapeutic measure to septic encephalopathy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652176>Effect of caseinate glycation with oligochitosan and transglutaminase on the intestinal  function of the tryptic caseinate digest in IEC-6 cells.</a></h1><p>Oligochitosan was used in this study to glycate commercial caseinate under the catalytic action of transglutaminase (TGase), followed by trypsin-mediated digestion. The prepared tryptic digests from both caseinate and oligochitosan-glycated caseinate were assessed and compared for their effects on the intestinal  function of a cell model (IEC-6 cells). Both digests had similar chemical features in the nine amino acids (except for Met) and free amino group contents, but had different glucosamine contents. Both digests at 12.-100 μg mL-1 promoted IEC-6 cell growth by 105.6-135.1% and more importantly improved intestinal epithelial   via increasing trans-epithelial electrical resistance, decreasing paracellular permeability from 100% to 64.1-85.4%, reducing bacterial translocation, and enhancing antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. The obtained qPCR and western-blot assay results also demonstrated that both digests had promoting effects on the expression levels of several tight junction proteins such as ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1. The oligochitosan-glycated caseinate digest always showed higher effects than the caseinate digest in the cells to retain the intestinal epithelial  function. This study thus highlights that the used TGase-type glycation endowed the oligochitosan-glycated caseinate with a potential functional food ingredient to strengthen the epithelial  function, which might be a helpful event to intestinal health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776942>Angiopoietin-1 accelerates restoration of endothelial cell   from nanoparticle-induced leakiness.</a></h1><p>Nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely used in biomedical field for therapeutic treatments, drug carriers, and bio-imaging agent. Recent studies have highlighted the possibility of utilizing inorganic NPs in inducing endothelial leakiness through endothelial remodeling to promote drug transport across the . However, an uncontrolled and persistent leakiness could lead to promiscuous transport of molecules and cells across the , highlighting the pressing need to control the timely recovery from endothelial cell leakiness. Herein, we show that angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) could promote recovery of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) from titanium dioxide nanoparticle (TiO NPs)-induced endothelial leakiness. Ang1 is known as an anti-permeability growth factor which forms complexes with its receptor Tie2 at the cell-to-cell junctions. We find that the introduction of Ang1 not only accelerates the recovery of NP-induced endothelial leakiness (NanoEL) but also promotes cell rigidity by increasing tubulin acetylation, thereby remodels the endothelial cells to further mitigate the effects of NP exposure through the activation of the Akt pathway. Using  metastasis model, we further show that HMVECs treated with TiO NPs followed by Ang1 could reduce migration of human skin cancer A431 cells across the endothelial . In summary, Ang1 plays important roles in promoting the recovery of endothelial cell leakiness and endothelial stability through a mechano-transduction pathway and shows great potential as key modulator that allows material scientist to regulate endothelial leakiness induced by NPs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31067281>Distinct roles for MDA5 and TLR3 in the acute response to inhaled double-stranded RNA.</a></h1><p>The airway epithelial  is critical for preventing pathogen invasion and translocation of inhaled particles into the lung. Epithelial cells also serve an important sentinel role after infection and release various pro-inflammatory mediators that recruit and activate immune cells. Airway epithelial  disruption has been implicated in a growing number of respiratory diseases including viral infections. It is thought that when a pathogen breaks the  and gains access to the host tissue, pro-inflammatory mediators increase, which further disrupts the  and initiates a vicious cycle of leak. However, it is difficult to study airway   in vivo, and little is known about relationship between epithelial  function and airway inflammation. Current assays of pulmonary   quantify the leak of macromolecules from the vasculature into the airspaces (or "inside/out" leak). However, it is also important to measure the ease with which inhaled particles, allergens, or pathogens can enter the subepithelial tissues (or "outside/in" leak). We challenged mice with inhaled double stranded RNA (dsRNA) and explored the relationship between inside/out and outside/in  function and airway inflammation. Using wild-type and gene-targeted mice, we studied the roles of the dsRNA sensors Toll Like Receptor 3 (TLR3) and Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein  (MDA5). Here we report that after acute challenge with inhaled dsRNA, airway  dysfunction occurs in a TLR3-dependent manner, whereas leukocyte accumulation is largely MDA5-dependent. We conclude that airway  dysfunction and inflammation are regulated by different mechanisms at early time points after exposure to inhaled dsRNA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713499>Autophagy Protects the Blood-Brain  Through Regulating the Dynamic of Claudin- in Short-Term Starvation.</a></h1><p>The blood-brain  (BBB) is essential for the exchange of nutrient and ions to maintain the homeostasis of central nervous system (CNS). BBB dysfunction is commonly associated with the disruption of endothelial tight junctions and excess permeability, which results in various CNS diseases. Therefore, maintaining the structural  and proper function of the BBB is essential for the homeostasis and physiological function of the CNS. Here, we showed that serum starvation disrupted the function of endothelial  as evidenced by decreased -endothelial electrical resistance, increased permeability, and redistribution of tight junction proteins such as Claudin- (Cldn5). Further analyses revealed that autophagy was activated and protected the  of endothelial  by scavenging ROS and inhibiting the redistribution of Cldn5 under starvation, as evidenced by accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and increased expression of LC3II/I, ATG5 and LAMP1. In addition, autophagosome was observed to package and eliminate the aggregated Cldn5 in cytosol as detected by immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscope. Moreover, Akt-mTOR-p70S6K pathway was found to be involved in the protective autophagy induced by starvation. Our data demonstrated that autophagy played an essential role in maintaining the  of endothelial  by regulating the localization of Cldn5 under starvation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30977499>Dietary l-tryptophan alleviated LPS-induced intestinal  injury by regulating tight junctions in a Caco-2 cell monolayer model.</a></h1><p>The intestinal epithelial layer forms a  through cell-cell tight junctions and breaking or even slightly disrupting this  can lead to serious pathological consequences, including infection and inflammation. Various amino acids have been shown to improve the intestinal tract, but the effect of tryptophan on the intestinal  has been controversial. Here, an in vitro Caco-2 cell model was built to investigate the protective and reparative effects of different concentrations of dietary l-Tryptophan (l-Trp) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intestinal tight junction injury. Lower concentrations (40 μM) of dietary l-Trp protected and repaired the  and permeability injury of the intestinal tight junction induced by LPS, while high concentrations (80 μM) may not have a positive effect. LPS-induced injury led to increased (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of Nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) and Myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), and decreased (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Mitogen-activated protein (MAP), and the treatment of dietary l-Trp alleviated those regulations in different concentrations, which suggests that dietary l-Trp may attenuate LPS-induced injury to tight junctions via inhibiting the NFκB-MLCK signaling pathway and activating the ERK1/2-MAP signaling pathway. And the mRNA and protein expressions of claudin-1, occludin and ZO-1 in LPS-induced injury were all down-regulated to varying degrees, and dietary l-Trp weakened the down-regulation of claudin-1 (P < 0.05) with no significant regulation of the protein expression of occludin and ZO-1 (P > 0.05).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848127>Transport of Flavanolic Monomers and Procyanidin Dimer A2 across Human Adenocarcinoma Stomach Cells (MKN-28).</a></h1><p>It has been proven that A-type procyanidins, containing an additional ether bond, compared to B-type procyanidins are also bioavailable in vitro and in vivo. However, their bioavailability and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract remain uncertain. In this study, a model of the human adenocarcinoma stomach cell line (MKN-28) was established to explore the cellular transport of flavanolic monomers and procyanidin dimer A2, which were isolated from the litchi pericarp extract. After the  and permeability of the cell monolayer were ensured by measurement of the transepithelial electrical resistance and the apparent permeability coefficient for Lucifer yellow, the transportation of procyanidins A2 and B2, (-)-epicatechin (EC), and (+)-catechin (CC) was studied at pH 3.0, .0, or 7.0 in the apical side, with compound concentrations of 0.05 and 0.1 mg/mL based on the cytotoxicity test. High-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses indicated that EC, CC, and A2 were transported in the MKN-28 cell line from 30 to 180 min, while B2 showed no transport. The maximal transport efficiencies of EC, CC, and A2 were 23 ± 0.81, 13.16 ± 1.53, and 16.41 ± 1.36%, respectively, existing at 120, 180, and 120 min of transportation.

The brain-to-plasma concentration ratios (K) and apparent unidirectional influx constants (K) of rhodamine123 and sodium fluorescein were measured to assess function of P-gp and BBB , respectively. Human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (HCMEC/D3) were used to assess effects of ammonia on P-gp expression and function. It was found that PVL+CHA significantly decreased K and K of rhodamine123 without affecting brain distribution of fluorescein. The P-gp expressions in membrane protein in cortex and hippocampus were significantly increased in CHA and PVL +CHA rats, especially in PVL + CHA rats, while remarkably increased phosphorylated ERK1/2 was only found in PVL +CHA rats. Expressions of tight junction proteins claudin- and occluding in rat brain remained unchanged. In vitro data showed that NHCl increased reactive oxygen species, membrane expression and function of P-gp as well as phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels in HCMEC/D3. The NHCl-induced alterations were reversed by reactive oxygen species scavenger N-acetylcysteine and ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126. In conclusion, PVL+CHA increased function and membrane translocation of P-gp at rat BBB partly via ammonia. Reactive oxygen species/ERK1/2 pathway activation may be one of the reasons that ammonia upregulated P-gp expression and function at BBB.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The blood-retinal  (BRB) was evaluated for  based on preoperative examinations, with vitreous hemorrhage (VH) on funduscopy or dye leakage on fluorescein angiography observed indicating disruption.NAb levels were much lower in the vitreous humor than in the serum regardless of serotype. Patients with VH had higher levels of NAbs in the vitreous humor than those without VH. The NAb ratio (ratio between NAb titers in the serum and vitreous humor) was much lower in patients with epiretinal membrane with than in those without leakage. A significantly lower NAb ratio was noticed in patients with than in those without BRB disruptions.The NAb ratio between levels in serum and vitreous humor varies according to the condition of the BRB. Therefore, in addition to measuring the serum NAb level, physicians should examine BRB  when planning retinal gene therapy.This study provides substantial basis for retinal gene therapy using AAVs and how maintenance of BRB  in target diseases should be considered.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068577>Mucosal-associated invariant T cells and oral microbiome in persistent apical periodontitis.</a></h1><p>Opportunistic bacteria in apical periodontitis (AP) may pose a risk for systemic dissemination. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are innate-like T cells with a broad and potent antimicrobial activity important for gut mucosal . It was recently shown that MAIT cells are present in the oral mucosal tissue, but the involvement of MAIT cells in AP is unknown. Here, comparison of surgically resected AP and gingival tissues demonstrated that AP tissues express significantly higher levels of Vα7.2-Jα33, Vα7.2-Jα20, Vα7.2-Jα12, Cα and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-17A transcripts, resembling a MAIT cell signature. Moreover, in AP tissues the MR1-restricted MAIT cells positive for MR1--OP-RU tetramer staining appeared to be of similar levels as in peripheral blood but consisted mainly of CD4 subset. Unlike gingival tissues, the AP microbiome was quantitatively impacted by factors like fistula and high patient age and had a prominent riboflavin-expressing bacterial feature. When merged in an integrated view, the examined immune and microbiome data in the sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis could identify bacterial relative abundances that negatively correlated with Vα7.2-Jα33, Cα, and IL-17A transcript expressions in AP, implying that MAIT cells could play a role in the local defence at the oral tissue . In conclusion, we describe the presence of MAIT cells at the oral site where translocation of oral microbiota could take place. These findings have implications for understanding the immune sensing of polymicrobial-related oral diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31495180>Inhibitory Effects of Black Ginseng on Particulate Matter-Induced Pulmonary Injury.</a></h1><p>Inhalation of fine particulate matter () is associated with elevated pulmonary injury caused by the loss of vascular  . Black ginseng (BG), steamed and dried ginseng nine times, exhibits various pharmacological activities such as antibacterial, antihyperglycemic, anti-atopic, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, we investigated the beneficial effects of black ginseng extract (BGE) against PM-induced lung endothelial cell (EC)  disruption and pulmonary inflammation. Permeability, leukocyte migration, activation of proinflammatory proteins, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and histology were examined in -treated ECs and mice. BGE significantly scavenged -induced ROS and inhibited the ROS-induced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Concurrently, BGE activated Akt, which helped maintain endothelial . Furthermore, BGE reduced vascular protein leakage, leukocyte infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine release in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in PM-induced lung tissues. These results indicated that BGE may exhibit protective effects against PM-induced inflammatory lung injury and vascular hyperpermeability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31346356>A Protective Role of the NRF2-Keap1 Pathway in Maintaining Intestinal  .</a></h1><p>Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) is a master regulator of cellular oxidative levels against environmental stresses.

This study investigated the role of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), a cytokine known to induce expression of the proprotein convertase Furin, in hypoxia-mediated  compromise. We show that exposure of brain endothelial cells (ECs) to hypoxia (1% O) rapidly stimulates their migration. Additional exogenous TGFβ (0.4 nM) exposure potentiated this effect and increased Furin expression in a TGFβ type I receptor activin-like kinase  (ALK5) - dependent manner (prevented by 10 μM SB431542). Furin inhibition prevented hypoxia-induced EC migration and blocked TGFβ-induced potentiation suggesting existence of a feedback loop. TGFβ and Furin were also critical for hypoxia-induced BBB dysfunction. TGFβ treatment aggravated hypoxia-induced BBB permeability but ALK5 or Furin blockade reversed injury-induced permeability changes. Thus during insult Furin compromises endothelial integrity by mediating the effects of TGFβ. Targeting the Furin or ALK5 pathway may offer novel therapeutic strategies for improving BBB stability and CNS  during disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this review, we aimed to discuss the morphological changes in each vessel following aging, and to evaluate the possible role of HS in the cerebrovascular alteration, such as arterial stiffness, microvessel loss, and blood-brain  disruption, with advancing age. Additionally, the review outlines the therapeutic efficacy of the HS-releasing compounds on the cerebrovasculature.

This study examined the effects of repeated exposure to primary BOP and post-blast treatment with an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA) on the  of BBB. Anesthetized rats were exposed to three 110 kPa BOPs separated by 0. h. BBB  was examined  via a cranial window allowing imaging of pial microcirculation by intravital microscopy. Tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate Dextran (TRITC-Dextran, mw = 40 kDa or 150 kDa) was injected intravenously 2. h after the first BOP exposure and the leakage of TRITC-Dextran from pial microvessels into the brain parenchyma was assessed. The animals were randomized into 6 groups ( = /group): four groups received 40 kDa TRITC-Dextran (BOP-40, sham-40, BOP-40 NACA, and sham-40 NACA), and two groups received 150 kDa TRITC-Dextran (BOP-150 and sham-150). NACA treated groups were administered NACA 2 h after the first BOP exposure. The rate of TRITC-Dextran leakage was significantly higher in BOP-40 than in sham-40 group. NACA treatment significantly reduced TRITC-Dextran leakage in BOP-40 NACA group and sham-40 NACA group presented the least amount of leakage. The rate of leakage in BOP-150 and sham-150 groups was comparable to sham-40 NACA and thus these groups were not assessed for the effects of NACA. Collectively, these data suggest that BBB  is compromised following BOP exposure and that NACA treatment at a single dose may significantly protect against blast-induced BBB breakdown.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31207256>Realgar and cinnabar are essential components contributing to neuroprotection of Angong Niuhuang Wan with no hepatorenal toxicity in transient ischemic brain injury.</a></h1><p>Realgar and cinnabar are commonly used mineral medicine containing arsenic and mercury in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Angong Niuhuang Wan (AGNHW) is a representative realgar- and cinnabar-containing TCM formula for treating acute ischemic stroke, but its toxicology and neuropharmacological effects are not well addressed. In this study, we compared the neuropharmacological effects of AGNHW and modified AGNHW in an experimental ischemic stroke rat model. Male SD rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) plus 22 h of reperfusion. Although oral administration of AGNHW for 7 days in the rats increased arsenic level in the blood and liver tissue, there were no significant changes in the arsenic level in kidney, mercury level in the blood, liver and kidney as well as hepatic and renal functions in MCAO rats. AGNHW revealed neuroprotective properties by reducing infarction volume, preserving blood-brain   and improving neurological functions against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Interestingly, removing realgar and/or cinnabar from AGNHW abolished the neuroprotective effects. Meanwhile, AGNHW could scavenge peroxynitrite, down-regulate the expression of p47, 3-NT and MMP-9 and up-regulate the expression of ZO-1 and claudin- in the ischemic brains, which were abolished by removing realgar and/or cinnabar from AGNHW. Notably, realgar or cinnabar had no neuroprotection when used alone. Taken together, oral administration of AGNHW for one week should be safe for treating ischemic stroke with neuroprotective effects. Realgar and cinnabar are necessary elements with synergetic actions with other herbal materials for the neuroprotective effects of AGNHW against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.Copyright © 2019.

However, the effects of dietary Trp supplementation on the intestinal  function in piglets exposed to oxidative stress remain unknown. This study was conducted to evaluate whether dietary Trp supplementation can attenuate intestinal injury, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction of piglets caused by diquat injection. Thirty-two piglets at 25 days of age were randomly allocated to four groups: (1) the non-challenged control; (2) diquat-challenged control; (3) 0.15% Trp-supplemented diet + diquat; (4) 0.30% Trp supplemented diet + diquat. On day seven, the piglets were injected intraperitoneally with sterilized saline or diquat (10 mg/kg body weight). The experiment lasted 21 days. Dietary supplementation with 0.15% Trp improved growth performance of diquat-challenged piglets from day 7 to 21. Diquat induced an increased intestinal permeability, impaired antioxidant capacity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although dietary supplementation with 0.15% Trp ameliorated these negative effects induced by diquat challenge that showed decreasing permeability of 4 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran, increasing antioxidant indexes, and enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis. Results indicated that dietary supplementation with 0.15% Trp enhanced intestinal , restored the redox status, and improved the mitochondrial function of piglets challenged with diquat.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620087>Formation of papillary mucosa folds and enhancement of epithelial  in odontogenic sinusitis.</a></h1><p>Odontogenic sinusitis (OS) presents more satisfactory therapeutic effect after endoscopic surgery compared with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) of other origin. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical characteristics, morphological features, and epithelial  function of sinus mucosa of OS and discuss the possible relationship with good prognosis.A total of 25 subjects with OS, 7 CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), 10 CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), and 9 control subjects were recruited. The biopsy specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for general observation of cytomorphologic features. Epithelial tight junctions (TJs) protein claudin-4 expression was determined to evaluate the epithelial   by using immunofluorescence and Image-Pro Plus software analysis. The representative cytokine profiles regarding T helper 1 (Th1) (interferon [IFN]-γ), Th2 (interleukin [IL]-), and Th17 (IL-17) were examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).Extensively small papillary protrusions could be seen in the maxillary sinus mucosa of OS patients under nasal endoscopy, similar to the morphological behavior, which also presented as papillary folds in the surface of the epithelium. The epithelium in OS kept an increased claudin-4 expression compared with that seen in CRSsNP, CRSwNP, and control subjects. The inflammatory pattern analysis demonstrated that OS belonged to the lymphocyte and plasma cell-dominant cellular phenotypes, whereas IL-17 was dominant compared with IFN-γ as well as IL-.The odontogenic infections might induce the formation of papillary mucosa folds and enhance the epithelial TJ  function. OS exhibited as lymphocyte and plasma cell-dominant cellular phenotypes and Th17 cytokine profiles.© 2019 ARS-AAOA, LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30911694>The effects of dairy products on seizure tendency in mice.</a></h1><p>Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder which occurs as a result of a spontaneous electrical discharge in the brain. According to recent studies there might be a relationship between specific diet and seizure occurrence. Casein is an important protein of milk which often causes hypersensitivity. It seems the release of inflammatory cytokines during the process of immune system response alter the blood-brain- (BBB)  and lead to neuronal inflammation which could constitute on epileptogenic focus. On the other hand, several studies represent full-fat milk or higher fat dairy products as an effective anti-inflammatory factor which elevate seizure threshold. The aim of present study was investigation of acute and chronic effects of dairy products including dough (a yogurt-based beverage), cheese, low and high fat yogurt and milk on pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures or electroshock in mice. The results of study indicated that lower fat dairy products reduced seizure threshold in intravenous PTZ-induced seizure as well as reduction in myoclonic and clonic jerk latencies in intraperitoneal PTZ-induced seizure. High fat products or cheese reduced seizure activity in both PTZ-induced models. Meanwhile both acute and chronic administration of dairy products had no effect on an electroshock-induced seizure. Therefore, diet-related seizures may depend upon the method which seizures are provoked.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31342870>Inhibitory effects of compounds isolated from  Decne peel on particulate matter-induced pulmonary injury in mice.</a></h1><p>Particulate matter 2. (PM), with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2. μm, is the primary air pollutant that plays a key role associated with lung injury produced by loss of vascular  integrity.  Decne (Chinese yam), a perennial plant belonging to Dioscoreaceae family, is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions across Asia. Both aerial parts and root of  are consumed for nutritional and medicinal purposes. The aim of this study was to (1) identify the bioactive compounds present in  peel which may be responsible for inhibition of PM-induced pulmonary inflammation in mice and (2) examine  mechanisms underlying the observed effects of these compounds on mouse lung microvascular endothelial cells. The measured parameters include permeability, leukocyte migration, proinflammatory protein activation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and histology. Two phenanthrene compounds, 2,7-dihydroxy-4,6-dimethoxyphenanthrene (1) and 6,7-dihydroxy-2,4-dimethoxyphenanthrene (2) were isolated from  peels. Both these phenanthrene compounds exhibited significant scavenging activity against PM-induced ROS and inhibited ROS-induced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. In addition, enhancement of Akt pathway, involved in the maintenance of endothelial integrity, was noted. These phenanthrene compounds also reduced vascular protein leakage, leukocyte infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine release in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from PM-induced lung tissues. Evidence thus indicates that phenanthrene compounds derived from  may exhibit protective effects against PM-induced inflammatory lung injury and vascular hyperpermeability in mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31391341>Dysregulated claudin- cycling in the inner retina causes retinal pigment epithelial cell atrophy.</a></h1><p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of central retinal vision loss worldwide, with an estimated 1 in 10 people over the age of 55 showing early signs of the condition. There are currently no forms of therapy available for the end stage of dry AMD, geographic atrophy (GA). Here, we show that the inner blood-retina  (iBRB) is highly dynamic and may play a contributory role in GA development. We have discovered that the gene CLDN5, which encodes claudin-, a tight junction protein abundantly expressed at the iBRB, is regulated by BMAL1 and the circadian clock. Persistent suppression of claudin- expression in mice exposed to a cholesterol-enriched diet induced striking retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell atrophy, and persistent targeted suppression of claudin- in the macular region of nonhuman primates induced RPE cell atrophy. Moreover, fundus fluorescein angiography in human and nonhuman primate subjects showed increased retinal vascular permeability in the evening compared with the morning. These findings implicate an inner retina-derived component in the early pathophysiological changes observed in AMD, and we suggest that restoring the  of the iBRB may represent a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of GA secondary to dry AMD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30675657>In vivo demonstration of blood-brain  impairment in Moyamoya disease.</a></h1><p>Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a cerebrovascular disorder characterized by fragile vascular system. Previous studies suggested that the blood-brain  (BBB) destabilizing cytokine angiopoietin-2 plays a critical role in increasing vascular plasticity and endothelial disintegration in MMD. The aim of this study was to assess cerebrovascular  in vivo in patients affected by MMD.We retrospectively analyzed 11 patients that underwent bypass for MMD (MMD group), 11 patients that underwent bypass for atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease (ACVD-control group I), and  patients that underwent clipping for unruptured aneurysms (non-ischemic-control group II). Sodium fluorescein (NaFL) extravasation was evaluated during videoangiography when checking for bypass patency. A grading system (0, +, ++, +++) was used to define the extent of extravasation. Frequency and intensity of leakage was compared among different groups.NaFL extravasation appeared in 10/11 (91%) patients with MMD and in 8/11 (73%) patients with ACVD during bypass procedures. Extravasation was observed in none of the patients undergoing clipping for unruptured aneurysms. Although both chronic ischemic patient groups showed a comparably high incidence of NaFL extravasation, the MMD group was characterized by a much greater intensity of NaFL extravasation (grade +++ in 82%) than the ACVD group (grade +++ in 27%, p < 0.05).We demonstrate blood-brain  impairment in MMD patients for the first time in vivo. This may be due to mechanisms intrinsic to the unique pathology of MMD, probably explaining the higher association with hemorrhage and post-operative hyperperfusion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048895>TRPV4 inhibition prevents increased water diffusion and blood-retina  breakdown in the retina of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.</a></h1><p>A better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in retinal hydro-mineral homeostasis imbalance during diabetic macular edema (DME) is needed to gain insights into retinal (patho-)physiology that will help elaborate innovative therapies with lower health care costs. Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily vanilloid member 4 (TRPV4) plays an intricate role in homeostatic processes that needs to be deciphered in normal and diabetic retina. Based on previous findings showing that TRPV4 antagonists resolve blood-retina  (BRB) breakdown in diabetic rats, we evaluated whether TRPV4 channel inhibition prevents and reverts retinal edema in streptozotocin(STZ)-induced diabetic mice. We assessed retinal edema using common metrics, including retinal morphology/thickness (histology) and BRB  (albumin-associated tracer), and also by quantifying water mobility through apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measures. ADC was measured by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), acquired ex vivo at 4 weeks after STZ injection in diabetes and control groups. DWI images were also used to assess retinal thickness. TRPV4 was genetically ablated or pharmacologically inhibited as follows: left eyes were used as vehicle control and right eyes were intravitreally injected with TRPV4-selective antagonist GSK2193874, 24 h before the end of the 4 weeks of diabetes. Histological data show that retinal thickness was similar in nondiabetic and diabetic wt groups but increased in diabetic Trpv4-/- mice. In contrast, DWI shows retinal thinning in diabetic wt mice that was absent in diabetic Trpv4-/- mice. Disorganized outer nuclear layer was observed in diabetic wt but not in diabetic Trpv4-/- retinas. We further demonstrate increased water diffusion, increased distances between photoreceptor nuclei, reduced nuclear area in all nuclear layers, and BRB hyperpermeability, in diabetic wt mice, effects that were absent in diabetic Trpv4-/- mice. Retinas of diabetic mice treated with PBS showed increased water diffusion that was not normalized by GSK2193874. ADC maps in nondiabetic Trpv4-/- mouse retinas showed restricted diffusion. Our data provide evidence that water diffusion is increased in diabetic mouse retinas and that TRPV4 function contributes to retinal hydro-mineral homeostasis and structure under control conditions, and to the development of BRB breakdown and increased water diffusion in the retina under diabetes conditions. A single intravitreous injection of TRPV4 antagonist is however not sufficient to revert these alterations in diabetic mouse retinas.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461996>Vitamin D Deficiency is Associated with Increased Disease Activity in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h1><p>Vitamin D has an inhibitory role in the inflammatory signaling pathways and supports the  of the intestinal .

The 25(OH)D3 levels were correlated with clinical activity indices and laboratory chemical activity parameters. A deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D3 levels <30 ng/mL.A total of 470 (257 female) patients with IBD were included, 272 (57.9%) with Crohn's disease (CD), 198 (42.1%) with ulcerative colitis (UC). The median age of the patients was 41 (18-84). In 283 patients (60.2%), a vitamin D deficiency was detected. 245 (53.6%) patients received oral vitamin D supplementation, and supplemented patients had significantly higher vitamin D levels (p < 0.0001). Remission, vitamin D substitution, and male gender were independently associated with the 25(OH)D3 serum concentration in our cohort in regression analysis. A 25(OH)D3 serum concentration of 27. ng/mL was the optimal cut-off value.Vitamin D deficiency is common in IBD patients and appears to be associated with increased disease activity. In our study, vitamin D levels were inversely associated with disease activity.

Microcirculatory dysfunction is thought to be an important and fundamental pathological change in EBI. However, other than blood-brain  (BBB) disruption, the influence of oxidative stress on microvessels remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of oxidative stress on microcirculatory  in EBI. SAH was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats using an endovascular perforation technique. A free radical scavenger, edaravone, was administered prophylactically by intraperitoneal injection. SAH grade, neurological score, brain water content, and BBB permeability were measured at 24 h after SAH induction. In addition, cortical samples taken at 24 h after SAH were analyzed to explore oxidative stress, microvascular mural cell apoptosis, microspasm, and microthrombosis. Edaravone treatment significantly ameliorated neurological deficits, brain edema, and BBB disruption. In addition, oxidative stress-induced modifications and subsequent apoptosis of microvascular endothelial cells and pericytes increased after SAH induction, while the administration of edaravone suppressed this. Consistent with apoptotic cell inhibition, microthromboses were also inhibited by edaravone administration. Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the induction of multiple pathological changes in microvessels in EBI. Antioxidants are potential candidates for the treatment of microvascular disturbances after SAH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155874>[Development of research on mechanisms of electroacupuncture intervention underlying improvement of cerebral ischemia rats in recent five years].</a></h1><p>In the present paper, we summarized the relevant research literature on the underlying mechanism of electroacupuncture (EA) intervention in improving cerebral ischemia (CI) in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model rats in recent  years from preconditioning and regular intervention. Outcomes showed that both EA preconditioning and regular intervention could relieve CI by reducing toxicity of excitatory amino acids (glutamate, aspartate) and TLR4/NF-κB-mediated inflammatory cascade reaction to relieve inflammatory injury. Moreover, EA preconditioning also could suppress the expression of pro-apoptosis genes and proteins to relieve apoptosis, regulate activation of microglia, and down-regulate the expression of blood brain  -related matrix metalloprotein 9. Regular EA intervention also could promote angiogenesis to increase supply of blood and oxygen, facilitate regeneration, proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells via triggering activation of Notch and Shh signaling pathways, and promote the secretion of neurotrophin by up-regulating the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor /Trk A receptor, and promote expression of axon growth and synaptic remodeling-related factor (Ephrin B2/Eph B2) and sr-GTPase activating protein 1 and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42, axon growth and orientated down-stream molecules).

Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of a glucocorticoid receptor agonist (GA) on growth performance, measures of immune function and intestinal  of SEW pigs. In both experiments, pigs were fed corn-soybean meal-based starter diets. In the first experiment, 48 pigs (initial BW 4.8 ± 0.7 kg) were weaned at 21 ± 1 days and randomly assigned to three GA treatment groups: 0, 0.2 and 0.6 mg GA/kg of BW injected intramuscularly. Treatments were administered one day before weaning. Pigs in the 0 mg GA group received sterile saline in place of GA. Body weight was measured daily from one day before to 7 days post-weaning, and then weekly until 28 days post-weaning. Piglets treated with 0.2 mg GA had a higher BW than piglets in other treatment groups during the 28-day course of the study (P <0.02). To further explore the mechanisms behind this result, a second experiment was performed in which a total of 18 gilts (BW .6 ± 0.85 kg) were randomly assigned into three treatment groups: suckling plus saline (UWS), weaned treated with GA (WGA; 0.2 mg GA/kg BW) and weaned plus saline (CON). Treatments were administered one day before and 3 days post-weaning. The WGA and CON groups were weaned at 23 ± 2 days, while the UWS group remained with sow for the duration of the study. Body weight was measured daily and blood plasma was collected at 0, 1, 4 and  days post-weaning. All gilts were euthanized  days after weaning and jejunum samples were collected for mucosal scrapings, histomorphological analysis and gene expression analysis. Plasma levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and haptoglobin were lower in WGA pigs compared with CON (P <0.02), while plasma total antioxidant capacity was higher in WGA pigs compared with both CON and UWS groups (P <0.01). Relative to CON, GA downregulated IL-18 gene expression in the jejunum, as assessed by both tissue homogenate and mucosal scrapings, but it upregulated claudin-IV gene expression only in the tissue homogenate (P <0.01). These results suggest that GA treatment improves the growth performance of SEW pigs in part by mitigating the negative effects of systemic inflammation. However, the effect of GA on   requires further investigation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102496>Cognitive Dysfunction in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: A Case for Initiating Trials.</a></h1><p>Cognitive dysfunction (CD) is an insidious and underdiagnosed manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that has a considerable impact on quality of life, which can be devastating. Given the inconsistencies in the modes of assessment and the difficulties in attribution to SLE, the reported prevalence of CD ranges from % to 80%. Although clinical studies of SLE-related CD have been hampered by heterogeneous subject populations and a lack of sensitive and standardized cognitive tests or other validated objective biomarkers for CD, there are, nonetheless, strong data from mouse models and from the clinical arena that show CD is related to known disease mechanisms. Several cytokines, inflammatory molecules, and antibodies have been associated with CD. Proposed mechanisms for antibody- and cytokine-mediated neuronal injury include the abrogation of blood-brain   with direct access of soluble molecules in the circulation to the brain and ensuing neurotoxicity and microglial activation. No treatments for SLE-mediated CD exist, but potential candidates include agents that inhibit microglial activation, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or that protect blood-brain  , such as C5a receptor blockers. Structural and functional neuroimaging data have shown a range of regional abnormalities in metabolism and white matter microstructural  in SLE patients that correlate with CD and could in the future become diagnostic tools and outcome measures in clinical trials aimed at preserving cognitive function in SLE.© 2019, American College of Rheumatology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31362132>Bisphenol AF compromises blood-testis   and sperm quality in mice.</a></h1><p>The profound influence of environmental chemicals on human health including inducing life-threatening gene mutation has been publicly recognized. Being a substitute for the extensively used endocrine-disrupting chemical BPA, Bisphenol AF (BPAF) has been known as teratogen with developmental toxicities and therefore potentially putting human into the risk of biological hazards. Herein, we deciphered the detrimental effects of BPAF on spermatogenesis and spermiotiliosis in sexual maturity of mice exposing to BPAF (, 20, 50 mg/kg/d) for consecutive 28 days. BPAF exposure significantly compromises blood-testis   and sperm quantity and quality in a dose-dependent manner. Sperms from BPAF exposure mice are featured by severe DNA damage, altered SUMOylation and ubiquitination dynamics and interfered epigenetic inheritance with hypermethylation of H3K27me3 presumably due to the aggregation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, BPAF treatment (50 μM for 24 h) compromises cytoskeleton architecture and tight junction permeability in primary cultured Sertoli cells evidenced by dysfunction of actin regulatory proteins (e.g. Arp3 and Palladin) via activation of ERK signaling, thereby perturbing the privilege microenvironment created by Sertoli cells for spermatogenesis. Overall, our study determines BPAF is deleterious for male fertility, leading to a better appreciation of its toxicological features in our life.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect of emotional stress on secretory IgA levels also indicates that stress decreases mucosal . Our aim was to evaluate whether a probiotic product (Lactoflorene Plus) can prevent alterations in the immune response associated with self-reported stress and microbiota composition. Healthy adult volunteers who self-reported psychological stress were enrolled and randomised into a placebo and a probiotic group. Salivary stress markers (α-amylase, cortisol, chromogranin A) and immunological parameters (sIgA, NK cell activity, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α) in feces and the composition of intestinal microbiota were evaluated. Administration of the product did not exert a direct effect on the salivary stress markers or NK cell activity but did reduce abdominal pain and increase faecal IgA and IL-10 levels. The probiotic product induced a moderate increase in  and  spp., as expected, and in  spp., and decreased the size of the  spp. and  and  populations. Administration of the product helped protect the mucosal  by supporting the number of short-chain fatty acid producers and decreasing the load of potentially harmful bacteria, thus reducing intestinal inflammation and abdominal discomfort..</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31419730>Aucubin, a natural iridoid glucoside, attenuates oxidative stress-induced testis injury by inhibiting JNK and CHOP activation via Nrf2 up-regulation.</a></h1><p>Eucommia ulmoides has been used for many years as a successful strategy to treat male infertility. Aucubin (AU) is the active ingredient extracted from Eucommia ulmoides. However, its protective action and exact mechanism on testicular injury is not yet known.Here, the protective effect and the mechanism of action of AU on testis damage under oxidative stress was investigated in vivo and in vitro.As regard the in vivo experiment, male mice were divided into five groups and testicular injury model was established by Triptolide (TP) (120 μg/kg) intraperitoneal injection for two weeks. Animals in the treatment group were pretreated with an intraperitoneal injection of AU at different doses (, 10 and 20 mg/kg) for 1 h and subsequently treated with TP (120 μg/kg). At the end of the experimental period, the testis was collected for biochemical and histological examination. As regard the in vitro experiment, Sertoli cells (SCs) were used to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of action of AU against disruption of the blood-testis- (BTB) and apoptosis induced by TP via apoptosis detection, western blot, immunofluorescence analysis, and siRNA transient transfection.TP-treated animals showed testicular atrophy, BTB disruption, increased ROS levels and spermatogenic dysfunction. Pre-administration of AU resulted in a significant protection on keeping a normal testicular weight, sperm morphology, BTB , and a normal level of oxidative stress markers and antioxidants. Furthermore, AU prevented apoptosis through an effective inhibition of PERK/CHOP and JNK dependent apoptosis pathway, as well as protected the  of BTB by up-regulating the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin-11) and gap junction protein (Cx43). The mechanistic study revealed that AU significantly triggered Nrf2 translocation, thus increasing nuclear Nrf2 accumulation and then induced antioxidant enzymes expression in the testis and SCs. Furthermore, Nrf2 silencing unsuccessfully reversed the increased CHOP and p-JNK expression induced by TP, abolishing the protective effect of AU.These results indicate that AU might be considered as a potential protective agent against testicular injury.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

However, phospholipids not only have structural but also regulatory functions that are involved in a myriad of signaling pathways. Integrative approaches in plants recently revealed that certain phospholipids have distinct patterns of accumulation at the tissue or organ scales, which turned out to be important cues in a developmental context. Using examples on different phospholipid classes, including phosphatidylinositol-4,-bisphosphate, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidic acid, we review how spatio-temporal lipid patterns arise at the organismal level and what are their downstream consequences on plant development.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The  of epidermal cells is maintained by tight regulation of proliferation and differentiation. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of epigenetic regulator H3K4me3 and its demethylase Jarid1b in the control of epithelial cell differentiation.RT-qPCR, Western blotting and IHC were used to detect mRNA and protein levels. We analysed cell proliferation by CCK8 assay and cell migration by wound healing assay. ChIP was used to measure H3K4me3 enrichment. A chamber graft model was established for epidermal development.Our studies showed that H3K4me3 was decreased during epidermal differentiation. The H3K4me3 demethylase Jarid1b positively controlled epidermal cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that Jarid1b substantially increased the expression of mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET)-related genes, among which Ovol1 positively regulated differentiation gene expression. In addition, Ovol1 expression was repressed by PI3K-AKT pathway inhibitors and overexpression (O/E) of the PI3K-AKT pathway suppressor Ship1. Knockdown (KD) of Ship1 activated downstream PI3K-AKT pathway and enhanced Ovol1 expression in HaCaT. Importantly, we found that Jarid1b negatively regulated Ship1 expression, but not that of Pten, by directly binding to its promoter to modulate H3K4me3 enrichment.Our results identify an essential role of Jarid1b in the regulation of the Ship1/AKT/Ovol1 pathway to promote epithelial cell differentiation.© 2019 The Authors.

The kinase RIPK4 and the transcription factor IRF6 are mutated in severe developmental syndromes in humans, and mice lacking these genes display epidermal hyperproliferation and soft-tissue fusions that result in neonatal lethality. Our understanding of how these genes control epidermal differentiation is incomplete. Here we show that the role of RIPK4 in mouse development requires its kinase activity; that RIPK4 and IRF6 expressed in the epidermis regulate the same biological processes; and that the phosphorylation of IRF6 at Ser413 and Ser424 primes IRF6 for activation. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), histone chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) of skin in wild-type and IRF6-deficient mouse embryos, we define the transcriptional programs that are regulated by IRF6 during epidermal differentiation. IRF6 was enriched at bivalent promoters, and IRF6 deficiency caused defective expression of genes that are involved in the metabolism of lipids and the formation of tight junctions. Accordingly, the lipid composition of the stratum corneum of Irf6 skin was abnormal, culminating in a severe defect in the function of the epidermal . Collectively, our results explain how RIPK4 and IRF6 function to ensure the  of the epidermis and provide mechanistic insights into why developmental syndromes that are characterized by orofacial, skin and genital abnormalities result when this axis goes awry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31013611>Radioprotective Effect of Walnut Oligopeptides Against Gamma Radiation-Induced Splenocyte Apoptosis and Intestinal Injury in Mice.</a></h1><p>Walnut oligopeptides (WOPs) intake is associated with the augment of the antioxidant defense system and immune system. The chief object of this study is to evaluate the radioprotective effect of walnut oligopeptides extracted from walnut seed protein against Coγ-irradiation induced damage in mice. Female BALB/c mice were administered WOPs through drinking water for 14 days until a single dose of whole-body Coγ-irradiation. The 30-day survival test was carried out in the first group (8 Gy), and the other two groups (3. Gy) were sacrificed at 3 days and 14 days post-irradiation. Blood and organ samples of mice in the three groups were collected, the histopathological analysis and immunohistochemistry were conducted. The number of peripheral blood leukocytes, bone marrow DNA content, inflammatory cytokines, antioxidant capacity, and intestinal permeability were measured. We found that the administration of WOPs augmented antioxidant defense system, accelerated hematopoietic recovery and showed the significant trend toward higher survival rate and less weight loss compared with non-administrated control mice. In addition, WOPs administration appeared to be important to limit IR-induced splenocyte apoptosis and inflammatory cascade as well as reduce intestine epithelial  dysfunction and promote epithelial . These results suggest that pre and post-treatment of WOPs may help to ameliorate acute damage, which is induced by ionizing radiation in mice and accelerate its recovery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811633>Age differences in photodynamic therapy-mediated opening of the blood-brain  through the optical clearing skull window in mice.</a></h1><p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a minimally invasive therapeutic tool, has been an important option for post-surgical treatment of malignant gliomas (MGs) in both adult and young patients. Recent studies have shown that PDT can also open the blood-brain  (BBB). However, there are no optimized parameters of PDT for patients at different ages. To determine whether there are age differences in PDT effects on the BBB, we studied PDT-related BBB opening through the optical clearing skull window in healthy 4- and 8-week-old mice.In this work, we realized BBB opening by combining PDT with the optical clearing skull window by using different radiant exposures (635 nm, 10-20-30-40 J/cm ) and -aminole-vulinic acid (-ALA, 20 mg/kg). Then, we evaluated BBB permeability by: (i) spectrofluorimetric measuring of Evans Blue dye (EBd) leakage; (ii) confocal imaging of 70 kDa FITC-dextran extravasation and the BBB ; and (iii) histological analysis of brain tissues.Using the skull optical clearing method, we demonstrated PDT-induced BBB opening to EBd and FITC-dextran in a radiant exposure manner. The histological analysis revealed the different severities of vasogenic edema corresponding to radiant exposures. Besides, the PDT-related increase in the BBB permeability to high weight molecules (EBd and FITC-dextran) and solutes (vasogenic edema) was more pronounced in 4-week-old mice than in 8-week-old mice.The more pronounced PDT-induced BBB disruption in juvenile mice compared with adult mice suggests age differences in PDT-related BBB opening. This might be an important informative platform for a new application of PDT as a method for brain drug delivery, especially for post-surgical treatment of MGs. Lasers Surg.

Longitudinal studies have demonstrated impairments persisting at least 1- years after hospitalization for critical illness. Cognitive domains impacted include memory, attention, and processing speed. Functional impairments include physical weakness, reduced endurance, and dependence on others for basic tasks of daily living such as bathing or feeding. In characterizing the trajectory of long-term recovery, multiple risk factors have been identified for subsequent impairment, including increased severity of illness and severe sepsis, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and delirium. Preadmission status including frailty, high level of preexisting comorbidities, and baseline cognitive dysfunction are also associated with impairment after critical illness. Development of cognitive and functional impairment is likely multifactorial, and multiple mechanistic theories have been proposed. Neuroinflammation, disruption of the blood-brain , and structural alterations in the brain have all been observed in patients with long-term cognitive dysfunction. Systemic inflammation has also been associated with alterations in muscle  and function, which is associated with intensive care unit-acquired weakness and prolonged functional impairment. Efforts to ease the burden of long-term impairments include prevention strategies and rehabilitation interventions after discharge. Delirium is a well-established risk factor for long-term cognitive dysfunction, and using delirium-prevention strategies may be important for cognitive protection. Current evidence favors minimizing overall sedation exposure, careful selection of sedation agents including avoidance of benzodiazepines, and targeted sedation goals to avoid oversedation. Daily awakening and spontaneous breathing trials and early mobilization have shown benefit in both cognitive and functional outcomes. Multifactorial prevention bundles are useful tools in improving care provided to patients in the intensive care unit. Data regarding cognitive rehabilitation are limited, while studies on functional rehabilitation have conflicting results. Continued investigation and implementation of prevention strategies and rehabilitation interventions will hopefully improve the quality of life for the ever-increasing population of critical illness survivors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30951558>Re-sequencing and transcriptome analysis reveal rich DNA variations and differential expressions of fertility-related genes in neo-tetraploid rice.</a></h1><p>Autotetraploid rice is a useful germplasm for polyploid rice breeding, however, low seed setting is the major  in commercial utilization of autotetraploid rice. Our research group has developed neo-tetraploid rice lines, which have the characteristics of high fertility and heterosis when crossed with autotetraploid rice. In the present study, re-sequencing and RNA-seq were employed to detect global DNA variations and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during meiosis stage in three neo-tetraploid rice lines compared to their parents, respectively. Here, a total of 4109881 SNPs and 640592 InDels were detected in neo-tetraploid lines compared to the reference genome, and 1805 specific presence/absence variations (PAVs) were detected in three lines. Approximately 12% and 0.% of the total SNPs and InDels identified in three lines were located in genic regions, respectively. A total of 28 genes, harboring at least one of the large-effect SNP and/or InDel which affect the  of the encoded protein, were identified in the three lines. Together, 324 specific mutation genes, including 52 meiosis-related genes and 8 epigenetics-related genes were detected in neo-tetraploid rice compared to their parents. Of these 324 genes, five meiosis-related and three epigenetics-related genes displayed differential expressions during meiosis stage. Notably, 498 specific transcripts, 48 differentially expressed transposons and 245 differentially expressed ncRNAs were also detected in neo-tetraploid rice.

Vanillin (Van), a natural phenolic compound with neuroprotective properties, exerts neuroprotection on a gerbil model of global ischemia by inhibiting oxidative damage. This study aimed to explore the potential neuroprotective roles of Van in neonatal rats suffering from hypoxic-ischemic (HI). An HI model of 7-day-old SD rats was induced by left carotid artery ligation followed by exposure to 8% oxygen (balanced with nitrogen) for 2. h at 37 °C. At 48 h after intraperitoneal injection with Van (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg) or saline, neurobehavioral , cerebral infract volume, brain water content, and histomorphological changes were performed to evaluate brain injury. Transmission electron microscopy and immunoglobulin G (IgG) staining were conducted to evaluate the integrity of the blood-brain  (BBB). The levels of oxidative stress and tight junction proteins, as well as the activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), were also determined in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Results showed that Van post-treatment significantly ameliorated early neurobehavioral deficits, decreased infarct volume and brain edema, as well as attenuated histopathologic injury and IgG extravasation. Furthermore, Van markedly increased the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and decreased malondialdehyde content. Meanwhile, the activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 induced by HI was partially blocked by Van. Finally, Van obviously increased the expression of ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin- compared with the HI group. Collectively, Van can provide neuroprotective effects against neonatal HIBD possibly by attenuating oxidative damage and preserving BBB integrity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Identifying the cellular and structural components of the BLB, the vascular endothelial cells (VECs), pericytes, and the perivascular basement membrane, is critical to understand the pathophysiology of the inner ear microvasculature and to design efficient delivery of therapeutics across the BLB. A recent study of the normal and pathological ultrastructural changes in the human macula utricle microvasculature demonstrated that the VECs are damaged in Meniere's disease (MD), and further studies identified oxidative stress markers (iNOS and nitrotyrosine) in the VECs. Using fluorescence microscopy, the microvasculature was studied in the macula utricle of patients diagnosed with MD that required transmastoid labyrinthectomy for intractable vertigo ( = ), and patients who required a translabyrinthine approach for vestibular schwannoma (VS) resection ( = 3). Normal utricles (controls) were also included ( = 3). VECs were identified using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) and pericytes were identified using mouse monoclonal antibodies against alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Immunofluorescence (IF) staining was made in half of the utricle and flat mounted. The other half was used to study the  of the BLB using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). GLUT-1-IF, allowed delineation of the macula utricle microvasculature (located in the stroma underneath the sensory epithelia) in both MD and VS specimens. Three sizes of vessels were present in the utricle vasculature: Small size (<15 μm), medium size (15-25 μm) and large size >25 μm. α-SMA-IF was present in pericytes that surround the VECS in medium and thick size vessels. Thin size vessels showed almost no α-SMA-IF. AngioTool software was used for quantitative analysis. A significant decreased number of junctions, total vessel length, and average vessel length was detected in the microvasculature in MD specimens compared with VS and control specimens. The deeper understanding of the anatomy of the BLB in the human vestibular periphery and its pathological changes in disease will enable the development of non-invasive delivery strategy for the treatment of hearing and balance disorders.Copyright © 2019 Ishiyama, Lopez, Acuna and Ishiyama.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31120609>Claudin-3 - a new intestinal  marker in patients with psoriasis: association with disease severity.</a></h1><p>Gut dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability play a significant role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and its comorbidities.

Plasma claudin-3 concentration was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Plasma claudin-3 concentration was significantly higher in patients with psoriasis in comparison with healthy control [median (interquartile range), 50.7 ng/mL (47.3-54.2) vs. 43.3 ng/mL (42.3-44.2), P < 0.001]. Patients who achieved ΔPASI90 response after 16 weeks of treatment showed tendency to decrease in circulating claudin-3 plasma concentration. Positive correlations between claudin-3 concentration and the PASI score (r = 0.828; P < 0.001) as well as claudin-3 and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (r = 0.847; P < 0.001) were found.

Here, we characterized the functional role of circular RNA USP1 (circ-USP1) in the regulation of the blood-tumour  (BTB) permeability and the potential mechanisms. In the current study, the circ-USP1 expressing level was up-regulated in glioma cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (GECs) of the BTB model in vitro. Knockdown of circ-USP1 disrupted the  , increased its permeability as well as reduced tight junction-related protein claudin-, occludin and ZO-1 expressions in GECs. Bioinformatic prediction and luciferase assay indicated that circ-USP1 bound to miR-194-5p and suppressed its activity. MiR-194-5p contributed to circ-USP1 knockdown-induced increase of BTB permeability via targeting and down-regulating transcription factor FLI1. Furthermore, FLI1 regulated the expressions of claudin-, occludin and ZO-1 in GECs through binding to their promoter regions. Single or combined treatment of circ-USP1 and miR-194-5p effectively promoted anti-tumour drug doxorubicin across BTB to induce apoptosis of glioma cells. Overall, this present study identified the crucial regulation of circ-USP1 on BTB permeability via miR-194-5p/FLI1 axis-mediated regulation of tight junction proteins, which might facilitate the development of therapeutics against human gliomas.© 2019 The Authors.

Metformin improves intestinal  function, although the underlying mechanism has yet to be fully explained. This study evaluates the protective effect of metformin on colonic   and explores the underlying cellular mechanisms.IBS-like rats were induced by maternal separation. Metformin was administered daily by gavage at 08:30, and rat pups were then separated from their mother. Visceral hyperalgesia and depression-like behaviors were evaluated by colorectal distension, sucrose preference tests, and forced swimming tests. Intestinal  was analyzed using sugar probes and transmission electron microscopy. Inflammatory factors and the levels of corticotropin-releasing factor were assessed by PCR and ELISA. The number of mast cells was evaluated by toluidine blue staining. Protein expression and localization were determined using Western blot and immunochemistry.Metformin pretreatment (a) reduced visceral hypersensitivity to colorectal distension, immobility time and enhanced sucrose consumption; (b) decreased urine lactulose/mannitol ratio and sucralose output; (c) inhibited the dilation of tight junction and prevented claudin-4 translocation; (d) inhibited mast cell activation and downregulated the expression of IL-6, IL-18, tryptase, PAR-2, and ERK activation; (e) inhibited claudin-4 phosphorylation at serine sites and interactions between clau-4 and ZO-1.Metformin may block mast cell activation to reduce PAR-2 expression and subsequently inhibit ERK activation and clau-4 phosphorylation at serine sites to normalize the interaction of clau-4 and ZO-1 and clau-4 distribution.

A biofunctional analysis of the neurovascular unit in wild type and NG2 null mice.</a></h1><p>During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis associated with blood-brain  (BBB) disruption, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) overexpress proteoglycan nerve/glial antigen 2 (NG2), proliferate, and make contacts with the microvessel wall. To explore whether OPCs may actually be recruited within the neurovascular unit (NVU), de facto intervening in its cellular and molecular composition, we quantified by immunoconfocal morphometry the presence of OPCs in contact with brain microvessels, during postnatal cerebral cortex vascularization at postnatal day 6, in wild-type (WT) and NG2 knock-out (NG2KO) mice, and in the cortex of adult naïve and EAE-affected WT and NG2KO mice. As observed in WT mice during postnatal development, a higher number of juxtavascular and perivascular OPCs was revealed in adult WT mice during EAE compared to adult naïve WT mice. In EAE-affected mice, OPCs were mostly associated with microvessels that showed altered claudin- and occludin tight junction (TJ) staining patterns and  leakage. In contrast, EAE-affected NG2KO mice, which did not show any significant increase in vessel-associated OPCs, seemed to retain better preserved TJs and BBB . As expected, absence of NG2, in both OPCs and pericytes, led to a reduced content of vessel basal lamina molecules, laminin, collagen VI, and collagen IV. In addition, analysis of the major ligand/receptor systems known to promote OPC proliferation and migration indicated that vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA), and the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) were the molecules most likely involved in proliferation and recruitment of vascular OPCs during EAE. These results were confirmed by real time-PCR that showed Fgf2, Pdgfa and Tgfb expression on isolated cerebral cortex microvessels and by dual RNAscope-immunohistochemistry/in situ hybridization (IHC/ISH), which detected Vegfa and Vegfr2 transcripts on cerebral cortex sections. Overall, this study suggests that vascular OPCs, in virtue of their developmental arrangement and response to neuroinflammation and growth factors, could be integrated among the classical NVU cell components. Moreover, the synchronized activation of vascular OPCs and pericytes during both BBB development and dysfunction, points to NG2 as a key regulator of vascular interactions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31106209>Impact of a  Direct-Fed Microbial on Growth Performance, Intestinal  , Necrotic Enteritis Lesions, and Ileal Microbiota in Broiler Chickens Using a Laboratory Challenge Model.</a></h1><p>Decreases in the use of antibiotics and anticoccidials in the poultry industry have risen the appearance of necrotic enteritis (NE). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a  direct-fed microbial (DFM) on growth performance, intestinal , NE lesions and ileal microbiota using a previously established NE-challenged model. At day-of-hatch, chicks were randomly assigned to three different groups: Negative control (NC), Positive control (PC) challenged with  Typhimurium (day 1),  (EM, day 13) and  (CP, day 18-19), and -DFM group (DFM) challenged as the PC. Body weight (BW) and body weight gain (BWG) were measured weekly. Total feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were evaluated at day 21. Liver samples were collected to assess bacterial translocation and blood samples were used to measure superoxide dismutase (SOD) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-d). Intestinal contents were obtained for determination of total IgA and microbiota analysis. NE lesion scores (LS) were performed at day 21. Chickens consuming the DFM significantly improved BW and had a numerically more efficient FCR compared to PC at day 21. Additionally, there were no significant differences in FCR between the DFM group and NC. Furthermore, the DFM group showed significant reductions in LS, IgA and FITC-d levels compared to the PC. However, there were no significant differences in SOD between the groups. The microbiota analysis indicated that the phylum  was significantly reduced in the DFM group in comparison to PC. At the genus level, , and  were reduced, whereas,  and  were increased in the DFM group as compared to PC ( < 0.05). Likewise, the DFM significantly reduced CP as compared to PC. In contrary, no significant differences were observed in bacterial composition between NC vs. DFM. In addition, beta diversity showed significant differences in the microbial community structure between NC vs. PC, and PC vs. DFM. These results suggest that the dietary inclusion of a selected DFM could mitigate the complex negative impacts caused by NE possibly through mechanism(s) that might involve modulation of the gut microbiota.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31100678>Inhibitory effects of collismycin C and pyrisulfoxin A on particulate matter-induced pulmonary injury.</a></h1><p>Inhalation of fine particulate matter (PM) is associated with elevated pulmonary injury caused by the loss of vascular  . Marine microbial natural products isolated from microbial culture broths were screened for pulmonary protective effects against PM. Two 2,2'-bipyridine compounds isolated from a red alga-associated Streptomyces sp. MC025-collismycin C (2) and pyrisulfoxin A ()-were found to inhibit PM-mediated vascular  disruption.To confirm the inhibitory effects of collismycin C and pyrisulfoxin A on PM-induced pulmonary injury STUDY DESIGN: In this study, we investigated the beneficial effects of collismycin C and pyrisulfoxin A on PM-induced lung endothelial cell (EC)  disruption and pulmonary inflammation.Permeability, leukocyte migration, proinflammatory protein activation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and histology were evaluated in PM-treated ECs and mice.Collismycin C and pyrisulfoxin A significantly scavenged PM-induced ROS and inhibited the ROS-induced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase as well as activated Akt, which helped in maintaining endothelial , in purified pulmonary endothelial cells. Furthermore, collismycin C and pyrisulfoxin A reduced vascular protein leakage, leukocyte infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine release in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of PM-treated mice.These data suggested that collismycin C and pyrisulfoxin A might exert protective effects on PM-induced inflammatory lung injury and vascular hyperpermeability.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

It is widely used as ingredients in a variety of food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. Animal studies have shown that consumption of aloe or purified aloin cause intestinal goblet cell hyperplasia, and malignancy. Here, we tested antibacterial effects of aloin, against intestinal commensal microbiota. Minimum inhibitory concentration of aloin for several human commensal bacterial species (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) ranged from 1 to 4 mg/ml. Metabolism studies indicated that  was capable of degrading aloin into aloe-emodin at a slower-rate compared to  spp. As a proof of concept, we incubated 3% rat fecal-slurry (an  model to simulate human colon content) with 0., 1, and 2 mg/ml of aloin to test antimicrobial properties. Low aloin concentrations showed minor perturbations to intestinal bacteria, whereas high concentration increased  sp. counts. Aloin also decreased butyrate-production in fecal microbiota in a dose-dependent manner after 24 h exposure. The 16S rRNA sequence-data revealed that aloin decreases the abundance of butyrate-producing bacterial species. Transepithelial resistant result revealed that aloin alters the intestinal -function at higher concentrations (500 μM). In conclusion, aloin exhibits antibacterial property for certain commensal bacteria and decreases butyrate-production in a dose -dependent manner. HIGHLIGHTS     -Aloin exhibits antibacterial properties for certain intestinal commensal bacteria.     -In rat fecal slurry (an  model to simulate human colon content), longer aloin exposure (24 h) decreases the butyrate production in dose dependent manner.     -The 16s rRNA sequencing data show that aloin decreased the abundance of butyrate producing bacterial species.     -Rat intestinal commensal bacteria metabolized aloin into aloe-emodin.     -Aloin altered the intestinal epithelial cells  , however, the metabolic product of aloin - Aloe-emodin did not alter epithelial cells permeability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31139758>Serum Bovine Immunoglobulins Improve Inflammation and Gut  Function in Persons with HIV and Enteropathy on Suppressive ART.</a></h1><p>Systemic inflammation persists in chronic HIV infection and is associated with increased rates of non-AIDS events such as cardiovascular and liver disease. Increased gut permeability and systemic exposure to microbial products are key drivers of this inflammation. Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) supports gut healing in other conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease.In this randomized, double-blind study, participants receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) with chronic diarrhea received placebo or SBI at 2. g BID or  g BID for 4 weeks, followed by a 20-week placebo-free extension phase with SBI at either 2. or  g BID. Intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), zonulin, flagellin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-binding protein, and inflammatory markers were measured by ELISA or multiplex assays. Non-parametric tests were used for analysis.One hundred three participants completed the study. By week 24 SBI significantly decreased circulating levels of I-FABP (-0.35 ng/μL, =0.002) and zonulin (-4.90 ng/μL, 0.003), suggesting improvement in gut damage, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (-0.40 pg/μL, =0.002), reflecting improvement in systemic inflammation. In participants with the lowest quartile of CD4+ T-cell counts at baseline (189-418 cells/μL), CD4+ T-cell counts increased significantly (26 cells/μL; =0.002).Oral SBI may decrease inflammation and warrants further exploration as a potential strategy to improve gut  and decrease systemic inflammation among persons receiving prolonged suppressive ART.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30836114>MitoQ ameliorates testis injury from oxidative attack by repairing mitochondria and promoting the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway.</a></h1><p>Mitochondrial dysfunctions induced by oxidative stress could play a pivotal role in the development of testicular damage and degeneration, leading to impaired fertility in adulthood. MitoQ as mitochondria-targeted antioxidant has been used in many diseases for a long time, but its therapeutic effects on testicular injury 'have not been reported yet. Here, we examined the protective action mechanism of MitoQ on testicular injury from oxidative stress induced by triptolide (TP). Mice were orally administrated with MitoQ (1.3, 2.6 and  .2mg/kg, respectively) in a TP-induced model of testicular damage for 14 days. And then testis injuries were comprehensively evaluated in terms of morphological changes, spermatogenesis assessment, blood-testis  (BTB) , and apoptosis. The results demonstrated MitoQ effectively increased testicular weight, maintained the  of BTB, protected microstructure of testicular tissue and sperm morphology by inhibition of oxidative stress. Further mechanism studies revealed that MitoQ markedly activates the Keap1-Nrf2 antioxidative defense system characterized by increasing the expression of Nrf2 and its target genes HO-1 and NQO1. Meanwhile, MitoQ upregulated the expression of mitochondrial dynamics proteins Mfn2 and Drp-1and exerted a protective effect on mitochondria. On this basis, the results from pharmacokinetic study indicated that the MitoQ could enter into testis tissues after oral administration in despite of the low absolute bioavailability, which provided the material basis for MitoQ in the treatment of testicular damage. More importantly, MitoQ reached mitochondria quickly and had an outstanding feature of mitochondria targeting in Sertoli cells. Therefore, these results provide information for the application of MitoQ against testicular injury diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In a prospective longitudinal design, we demonstrate there are reductions in midbrain white matter  due to a single season of collegiate football, and that the amount of reduction in midbrain white matter  is related to the amount of rotational acceleration to which players' brains are exposed. We then replicate the observation of reduced midbrain white matter  in a retrospective cohort of individuals with frank concussion, and further show that variance in white matter  is correlated with levels of serum-based tau, a marker of blood-brain  disruption. These findings mean that noninvasive structural MRI of the midbrain is a succinct index of both clinically silent white matter injury as well as frank concussion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511021>Claudin-12 is not required for blood-brain  tight junction function.</a></h1><p>The blood-brain  (BBB) ensures central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis by strictly controlling the passage of molecules and solutes from the bloodstream into the CNS. Complex and continuous tight junctions (TJs) between brain endothelial cells block uncontrolled paracellular diffusion of molecules across the BBB, with claudin- being its dominant TJs protein. However, claudin- deficient mice still display ultrastructurally normal TJs, suggesting the contribution of other claudins or tight-junction associated proteins in establishing BBB junctional complexes. Expression of claudin-12 at the BBB has been reported, however the exact function and subcellular localization of this atypical claudin remains unknown.We created claudin-12-lacZ-knock-in C57BL/6J mice to explore expression of claudin-12 and its role in establishing BBB TJs function during health and neuroinflammation. We furthermore performed a broad standardized phenotypic check-up of the mouse mutant.Making use of the lacZ reporter allele, we found claudin-12 to be broadly expressed in numerous organs. In the CNS, expression of claudin-12 was detected in many cell types with very low expression in brain endothelium. Claudin-12 C57BL/6J mice lacking claudin-12 expression displayed an intact BBB and did not show any signs of BBB dysfunction or aggravated neuroinflammation in an animal model for multiple sclerosis. Determining the precise localization of claudin-12 at the BBB was prohibited by the fact that available anti-claudin-12 antibodies showed comparable detection and staining patterns in tissues from wild-type and claudin-12 C57BL/6J mice.Our present study thus shows that claudin-12 is not essential in establishing or maintaining BBB TJs . Claudin-12 is rather expressed in cells that typically lack TJs suggesting that claudin-12 plays a role other than forming classical TJs. At the same time, in depth phenotypic screening of clinically relevant organ functions of claudin-12 C57BL/6J mice suggested the involvement of claudin-12 in some neurological but, more prominently, in cardiovascular functions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561505>A Dual Protective Effect of Intestinal Remote Ischemic Conditioning in a Rat Model of Total Hepatic Ischemia.</a></h1><p>The present study aimed to investigate the effects of intestinal remote ischemic preconditioning (iRIC) on ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and gut   in a rat model of total hepatic ischemia (THI). Male Wistar rats ( = 50; 250-300 g) were randomly allocated into two experimental groups: RIC/Control. Thirty minutes of THI was induced by clamping the hepatoduodenal ligament. iRIC was applied as 4-min of ischemia followed by 11-min of reperfusion by clamping the superior mesenteric artery. Animals were sacrificed at 1, 2, 6, 24 h post-reperfusion ( = /group/timepoint). RIC of the gut significantly improved microcirculation of the ileum and the liver. Tissue ATP-levels were higher following iRIC (Liver: 1.34 ± 0.12 vs. 0.97 ± 0.20 μmol/g,  = 0.04) and hepatocellular injury was reduced significantly (ALT: 2409 ± 447 vs. 6613 ± 1117 IU/L,  = 0.003). Systemic- and portal venous IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels were markedly lower following iRIC, demonstrating a reduced inflammatory response. iRIC led to a structural and functional preservation of the intestinal . These results suggest that iRIC might confer a potent protection against the detrimental effects of THI in rats via reducing IRI and systemic inflammatory responses and at the same time by mitigating the dramatic consequences of severe intestinal congestion and bacterial translocation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31478134>Anfibatide Preserves Blood-Brain   by Inhibiting TLR4/RhoA/ROCK Pathway After Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Rat.</a></h1><p>The disruption of the blood-brain  (BBB) and the consequent brain edema are major contributors to the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. RhoA is generally thought to play a crucial role in the process of BBB disruption and participate in the signaling pathways emanating from TLR4. However, it remains unverified the regulatory role of TLR4 in the RhoA/ROCK pathway in cerebral I/R injury and its effects on the BBB as well. The present study probes into the protective effect of ANF on the BBB after cerebral I/R injury and the possible mechanisms. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by 120 min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). ANF (1, 2, 4 μg/kg) was achieved by intravenous injection after 120 min of MCAO followed by 1, 24, 48, and 72 h reperfusion. Evans blue extravasation, brain water content, RhoA activity, and the expressions of TLR4, ROCK1/2, p-MLC2, MMP-2/9, ZO-1, occludin, and claudin- protein in rat brain were evaluated 72 h after reperfusion. ANF could significantly reduce the Evans blue extravasation and water content in the ipsilateral hemisphere and obviously increase the occludin, claudin-, and ZO-1 expression after cerebral I/R injury. Furthermore, cerebral I/R injury induced apparently increased expression of TLR4, RhoA-GTP, ROCK1/2, p-MLC2, and MMMP-2/9, which, however, could be remarkably alleviated by ANF intervention. Taken together, the TLR4/RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway is implicated in BBB breakdown after cerebral I/R injury, and ANF preserves BBB , probably via inhibiting the TLR4/RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888017>A soluble and highly fermentable dietary fiber with carbohydrases improved gut   markers and growth performance in F18 ETEC challenged pigs1.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a source of dietary soluble (SF) and insoluble fiber (IF) without or with exogenous carbohydrases (xylanase, β-glucanase, and pectinase) on diarrhea incidence, selected immune responses, and growth performance in enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC)-challenged pigs. Sixty weaned pigs (6.9 ± 0.1 kg BW, ~23 d of age) were blocked by initial BW and placed in individual pens. Pens were randomly assigned to one of six treatments (n = 10 per treatment), including a nonchallenged control (NC), a positive challenge control (PC), the PC + a soluble fiber diet (10% sugar beet pulp) without (SF-) or with carbohydrases (SF+), and PC + an IF diet (15% corn distillers dried grains with solubles) without (IF-) or with carbohydrases (IF+). The control diet was primarily based on corn and soybean meal with 13.% whey powder. The two sources of fiber were added at the expense of cornstarch in the control diet. Pigs were orally inoculated with 6 mL hemolytic F18 ETEC (~3. × 109 cfu/mL) or sham infected with 6 mL phosphate-buffered saline on day 7 (0 d postinoculation, dpi) postweaning. All ETEC challenged pigs were confirmed to be genetically susceptible to F18 ETEC. Pigs had free access to feed and water throughout the 14-d trial. Pig BW and feed intake were recorded on dpi -7, 0, and 7 or 8. Fecal swabs were collected on dpi -7, 0, 1, 2, 3, , and 7 or 8 to evaluate hemolytic E. coli shedding. Fecal score was visually ranked daily postchallenge to evaluate diarrhea incidence. Blood samples were collected on dpi -1, 3, and 7 or 8 at necropsy and intestinal tissues were collected at necropsy. Pigs on PC had lower dpi 1 to 7 ADG and ADFI than those on NC (P < 0.05). Compared with PC pigs, SF+ pigs had greater ADG during both pre- and postchallenge period (P < 0.05). The IF- increased postchallenge diarrhea incidence compared with PC (P < 0.05). Pigs on SF- had lower ileal E. coli attachment than PC (P < 0.05). The SF+ reduced haptoglobin and IF+ reduced C-reactive protein on dpi 3 compared with PC (P < 0.05). Compared with PC pigs, SF+ pigs tended to have lower ileal tumor necrosis factor alpha and greater ileal occludin (OCLN) mRNA (P < 0.10) and had greater (P < 0.05) colonic OCLN mRNA levels. Collectively, IF- increased incidence of diarrhea and fecal E. coli shedding compared with PC. The SF+ pigs had improved growth compared with PC pigs, likely due in part to a reduction in inflammatory intermediates.© The Author(s) 2019.

We examined the interaction between CKD and brain microhemorrhages (the neuropathological substrate of microbleeds) in mouse and cell culture models and studied progression of microbleed burden on serial brain imaging from humans. Mouse studies: Two CKD models were investigated: adenine-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis and surgical /6 nephrectomy. Cell culture studies: bEnd.3 mouse brain endothelial cells were grown to confluence, and monolayer  was measured after exposure to -15% human uremic serum or increasing concentrations of urea. Human studies: Progression of brain microbleeds was evaluated on serial MRI from control, pre-dialysis CKD, and dialysis patients. Microhemorrhages were increased 2-2.-fold in mice with CKD independent of higher blood pressure in the /6 nephrectomy model. IgG staining was increased in CKD animals, consistent with increased blood-brain  permeability. Incubation of bEnd.3 cells with uremic serum or elevated urea produced a dose-dependent drop in trans-endothelial electrical resistance. Elevated urea induced actin cytoskeleton derangements and decreased claudin- expression. In human subjects, prevalence of microbleeds was 50% in both CKD cohorts compared with 10% in age-matched controls. More patients in the dialysis cohort had increased microbleeds on follow-up MRI after 1. years. CKD disrupts the blood-brain  and increases brain microhemorrhages in mice and microbleeds in humans. Elevated urea alters the actin cytoskeleton and tight junction proteins in cultured endothelial cells, suggesting that these mechanisms explain (at least in part) the microhemorrhages and microbleeds observed in the animal and human studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574619>Abdominal Pain and Disturbed Bowel Movements are Frequent among Young People.

We investigated the roles of S1P/S1P receptors in RPE cells. ARPE-19 cells were treated with S1P dissolved in carrier proteins of albumin or apolipoprotein M (ApoM). The mRNA expression levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8), C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The protein level of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α was assessed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HIF transcriptional activity was evaluated with a dual-reporter luciferase assay. Cellular   was evaluated using transepithelial electrical resistance and the FITC-dextran permeability assay. The suppressive effect of an S1P antagonist on CNV progression was investigated with a laser-induced CNV model in mice. The increase in expression of IL-8, CCL2, and VEGF due to albumin-bound S1P was significantly mitigated by an S1P2 antagonist. The expression of HIF-1α significantly decreased with inhibition of S1P2 and S1P3. In addition, albumin-bound S1P disrupted the   of retinal pigment epithelial cells via S1P2, whereas  was strengthened by ApoM-bound S1P. CNV lesions were significantly reduced in the mouse model with intravitreal injection of S1P2 antagonist.

YXQNW (0. g/kg/day), enalapril (EN, 8 mg/kg/day), and nifedipine (NF, 7.1 mg/kg/day) were administrated orally for 4 weeks. To assess the effects of the YXQNW on blood pressure, the systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean blood pressure (MBP) were measured. After administering the drugs for 4 weeks, the cerebral blood flow (CBF), albumin leakage from microvessels in middle cerebral artery (MCA)-dominated area, and the number and morphology of microvessels were assessed in the hippocampus area and cortex. Neuronal damage and apoptosis were assessed by Nissl staining and TUNEL staining. To assess the mechanisms of cerebrovascular hyperpermeability, we performed immunofluorescence and Western blot to assess the expression and  of cerebral microvascular tight junction (TJ) and caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in cortex. Energy metabolism and Src-MLC-MLCK pathway in cortex were assessed then for elucidating the underlying mechanism of the observed effect of YXQNW.Spontaneously hypertensive rat exhibited higher blood pressure, Evans blue (EB) extravasation, albumin leakage, increased brain water content, decreased CBF, perivascular edema, and neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus and cortex, all of which were attenuated by YXQNW treatment. YXQNW inhibited the downregulation of TJ proteins, mitochondrial Complex I, Complex II, and Complex V, and upregulation of caveolin-1, inhibiting Src/MLCK/MLC signaling in SHR. YXQNW combined with EN + NF revealed a better effect for some outcomes compared with either YXQNW or EN + NF alone.The overall result shows the potential of YXQNW to attenuate blood-brain  (BBB) breakdown in SHR, which involves regulation of energy metabolism and Src/MLCK/MLC signaling.

During ITER operation, in case of a loss-of-vacuum-accident, tungsten nanoparticles (W-NPs) could potentially be released into the environment and induce occupational exposure via inhalation. W-NPs toxicity was evaluated on MucilAir™, a 3D in vitro cell model of the human airway epithelium. MucilAir™ was exposed for 24 h to metallic ITER-like milled W-NPs, tungstate (WO) and tungsten carbide cobalt particles alloy (WC-Co). Cytotoxicity and its reversibility were assessed using a kinetic mode up to 28 days after exposure. Epithelial tightness, metabolic activity and interleukin-8 release were also evaluated. Electron microscopy was performed to determine any morphological modification, while mass spectrometry allowed the quantification of W-NPs internalization and of W transfer through the MucilAir™. Our results underlined a decrease in  , no effect on metabolic activity or cell viability and a transient increase in IL-8 secretion after exposure to ITER-like milled W-NPs.

Eighteen-week-old NZBWF1 [systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)] and NZW/LacJ (control) mice were treated with vehicle or LC40 ( × 10 colony-forming units/d) for 15 wk. LC40 treatment reduced lupus disease activity, blood pressure, cardiac and renal hypertrophy, and splenomegaly in SLE mice. LC40 reduced the elevated T, B, regulatory T cells (T), and T helper (T)-1 cells in mesenteric lymph nodes of lupus mice. LC40 lowered the higher plasma concentration of proinflammatory cytokines observed in lupus mice. Aortas from SLE mice showed reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses to acetylcholine. Endothelial dysfunction found in SLE is related to an increase of both NADPH oxidase-driven superoxide production and eNOS phosphorylation at the inhibitory Thr. These activities returned to normal values after a treatment with LC40. Probiotic administration to SLE mice reduced plasma LPS levels, which might be related to an improvement of the gut  .

Coincidently, CST-IV includes species associated with bacterial vaginosis (e.g. , , and ). Both diseases are linked to the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and preterm birth, which complications are likely to result from the disruption of the cervicovaginal epithelial . Here, we show that paracellular permeability of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran through a monolayer of human ectocervical cells (hECs) is increased as a consequence of the activity of  and the aforementioned species of CST-IV bacteria cooperatively.  enhances paracellular permeability of hECs two times more than the individual bacterial species, by up to ∼10% versus ∼%, respectively. However, any two or all three bacterial species are capable of synergizing this effect.  and the bacteria together increase the paracellular permeability of hECs by ∼50%, which is  to 10 times more than the results seen with the protozoan or bacteria alone. This effect is accompanied by enhancement of phosphatase activity, while phosphatase inhibition results in preservation of the  of the ectocervical cell monolayer. In addition, these microorganisms induce changes in the expression of tight junction proteins, particularly occludin, and of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Together, our findings establish that cooperative interactions between CST-IV bacteria and  enhance the paracellular permeability of the cervicovaginal epithelium by disturbing the  of the tight junction complex. Our study results highlight the importance of understanding the contribution of the vaginal microbiota to trichomoniasis.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545471>High‑fat treatment prevents postoperative cognitive dysfunction in a hyperlipidemia model by protecting the blood‑brain  via Mfsd2a‑related signaling.</a></h1><p>Damage to the blood‑brain  (BBB) resulting from systemic inflammation caused by surgical trauma is associated with cognitive dysfunction, and individuals with hyperlipidemia are more sensitive to such impairment. The present study was designed to ascertain whether dexmedetomidine (Dex) treatment could reduce the incidence of cognitive dysfunction following surgery in a hyperlipidemia model. Hyperlipidemia was induced in Sprague‑Dawley rats (male, 6‑7 months old) by consuming a high‑fat diet, and rats were divided into three groups (n=10 each) and underwent: exploratory laparotomy to introduce surgical trauma (surgery group), laparotomy and Dex treatment (surgery+Dex group), or sham surgery (sham group). Learning, memory and exploration behavior were assessed using the Morris water maze. Concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α and interleukin (IL)‑1β, were determined by enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay. BBB permeability was assessed by Evans blue staining. Relative major facilitator superfamily domain‑containing protein 2 (Mfsd2a) mRNA expression was determined by quantitative PCR. In the Morris water maze test, the time and distance ratio for the surgery group was significantly lower than those of the sham and surgery+Dex groups (P<0.05). In addition, the TNF‑α concentrations in the sham and surgery+Dex groups were lower than that in the surgery group (P<0.05 on days 1 and 3). Evans Blue staining was increased in the surgery group on day 1 (P<0.01). Mfsd2a mRNA expression was higher in the sham and surgery+Dex groups compared with that noted in the surgery group (P<0.05). In conclusion, Dex treatment decreased the incidence of cognitive dysfunction following surgical trauma in a hyperlipidemia rat model. We demonstrated that Dex stabilized BBB  through increased Mfsd2a gene expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415078>COMP-Ang1 Stabilizes Hyperglycemic Disruption of Blood-Retinal  Phenotype in Human Retinal Microvascular Endothelial Cells.</a></h1><p>Current treatments for diabetic retinopathy (DR) have considerable limitations, underpinning the need for new therapeutic options. In this article, the ability of an engineered angiopoietin-1 variant (COMP-Ang1) to ameliorate the injurious effects of hyperglycemia on   in a human retinal microvascular endothelial cell (HRMvEC) model is comprehensively investigated.Confluent HRMvECs were treated (0-72 hours) with d-glucose ( or 30 mM) in the absence and presence of COMP-Ang1 (10-200 ng/mL). l-glucose (30 mM) was used as osmotic control. Posttreatment, intact cell monolayers were monitored for permeability to FITC-dextran 40 kDa. Cells were also harvested for analysis of interendothelial junction targets by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. The impact of receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 gene silencing on COMP-Ang1 efficacy was also evaluated.Treatment with 30 mM d-glucose (but not l-glucose) demonstrated a time-dependent elevation in the mean rate of FITC-dextran diffusion across intact HRMvEC monolayers, in parallel with significant reductions in mRNA/protein levels of occludin, claudin-, ZO-1, and VE-Cadherin. These effects were all attenuated by COMP-Ang1 in a concentration-dependent fashion, with 200 ng/mL recovering  function by ∼88%, and recovering reduced interendothelial junction protein levels by more than 50%. Finally, Tie2 knockdown by small interfering RNA silencing blocked the ability of COMP-Ang1 to mitigate against hyperglycemia-induced permeabilization of HRMvECs and depletion of junctional expression levels.In summary, this article presents a reproducible in vitro cell study that quantifies the concentration-dependent efficacy of COMP-Ang1 to mitigate the injurious effects of hyperglycemic challenge on HRMvEC  properties via Tie2-mediated signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700914>Interleukin-22 protects intestinal stem cells against genotoxic stress.</a></h1><p>Environmental genotoxic factors pose a challenge to the genomic  of epithelial cells at  surfaces that separate host organisms from the environment. They can induce mutations that, if they occur in epithelial stem cells, contribute to malignant transformation and cancer development. Genome  in epithelial stem cells is maintained by an evolutionarily conserved cellular response pathway, the DNA damage response (DDR). The DDR culminates in either transient cell-cycle arrest and DNA repair or elimination of damaged cells by apoptosis. Here we show that the cytokine interleukin-22 (IL-22), produced by group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) and γδ T cells, is an important regulator of the DDR machinery in intestinal epithelial stem cells. Using a new mouse model that enables sporadic inactivation of the IL-22 receptor in colon epithelial stem cells, we demonstrate that IL-22 is required for effective initiation of the DDR following DNA damage. Stem cells deprived of IL-22 signals and exposed to carcinogens escaped DDR-controlled apoptosis, contained more mutations and were more likely to give rise to colon cancer. We identified metabolites of glucosinolates, a group of phytochemicals contained in cruciferous vegetables, to be a widespread source of genotoxic stress in intestinal epithelial cells. These metabolites are ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and AhR-mediated signalling in ILC3 and γδ T cells controlled their production of IL-22. Mice fed with diets depleted of glucosinolates produced only very low levels of IL-22 and, consequently, the DDR in epithelial cells of mice on a glucosinolate-free diet was impaired. This work identifies a homeostatic network protecting stem cells against challenge to their genome  by AhR-mediated 'sensing' of genotoxic compounds from the diet. AhR signalling, in turn, ensures on-demand production of IL-22 by innate lymphocytes directly regulating components of the DDR in epithelial stem cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833331>Loss of Trefoil Factor 2 Sensitizes Rat Pups to Systemic Infection with the Neonatal Pathogen  K1.</a></h1><p>Gastrointestinal (GI) colonization of 2-day-old (P2) rat pups with  K1 results in translocation of the colonizing bacteria across the small intestine, bacteremia, and invasion of the meninges, with animals frequently succumbing to lethal infection. Infection, but not colonization, is strongly age dependent; pups become progressively less susceptible to infection over the P2-to-P9 period. Colonization leads to strong downregulation of the gene encoding trefoil factor 2 (Tff2), preventing maturation of the protective mucus  in the small intestine. Trefoil factors promote mucosal homeostasis. We investigated the contribution of Tff2 to protection of the neonatal rat from  K1 bacteremia and tissue invasion. Deletion of , using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9, sensitized P9 pups to  K1 bacteremia. There were no differences between   homozygotes and the wild type with regard to the dynamics of GI colonization. Loss of the capacity to elaborate Tff2 did not impact GI tract  or the thickness of the small-intestinal mucus layer but, in contrast to P9 wild-type pups, enabled  K1 bacteria to gain access to epithelial surfaces in the distal region of the small intestine and exploit an intracellular route across the epithelial monolayer to enter the blood circulation via the mesenteric lymphatic system. Although primarily associated with the mammalian gastric mucosa, we conclude that loss of Tff2 in the developing neonatal small intestine enables the opportunistic neonatal pathogen  K1 to enter the compromised mucus layer in the distal small intestine prior to systemic invasion and infection.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30983357>Large-Scale Quantitative Comparison of Plasma Transmembrane Proteins between Two Human Blood-Brain  Model Cell Lines, hCMEC/D3 and HBMEC/ciβ.</a></h1><p>Transmembrane (TM) proteins localized at the plasma membrane, such as transporters and receptors, play important roles in regulating the selective permeability of the blood-brain  (BBB). The purpose of the present study was to clarify the differences in the expression levels of TM proteins in the plasma membrane between two established human BBB model cell lines, hCMEC/D3 and HBMEC/ciβ, in order to assist researchers in selecting the most appropriate cell line for particular purposes. We first confirmed that plasma membranes could be enriched sufficiently for a quantitative proteomics study by using the Plasma Membrane Protein Extraction Kit provided by BioVision with a modified protocol. This method was applied to hCMEC/D3 and HBMEC/ciβ cells, and fractions were used for untargeted quantitative proteomics based on sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment-ion spectra. In the plasma membrane fractions, 345 TM proteins were quantified, among which 135 showed significant expression differences between the two cell lines. In hCMEC/D3 cells, amino acid transporters SNAT1, SNAT2, SNAT5, ASCT1, CAT1, and LAT1; adenosine '-triphosphate-binding cassette transporters P-gp and MRP4; and GLUT1 were more highly expressed. The transferrin receptor expression was also 4.56-fold greater in hCMEC/D3 cells. In contrast, HBMEC/ciβ cells expressed greater levels of IgG transporter neonatal Fc receptor, as well as tight-junction proteins PECAM1, JAM1, JAM3, and ESAM. Our results suggest that hCMEC/D3 cells have greater efflux transport, amino acid transport, and transferrin receptor-mediated uptake activities, whereas HBMEC/ciβ cells have greater IgG-transport activity and tight-junction .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30864725>Ginsenoside Rb1 attenuates intestinal ischemia/reperfusion‑induced inflammation and oxidative stress via activation of the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>Ginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1), one of the major active saponins isolated from ginseng, has recently been reported to protect various organs against ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury; however, the mechanisms underlying these protective effects following intestinal IR (IIR) remain unclear. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of GRb1 on IIR injury and determine the mechanisms involved in these effects. Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to 75 min of superior mesenteric artery occlusion, followed by 3 h of reperfusion. GRb1 (15 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 1 h prior to the induction of IIR, with or without intravenous administration of Wortmannin [WM; a phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, 0.6 mg/kg]. The degree of intestinal injury and oxidative stress‑induced damage was determined by histopathologic evaluation and measurement of the serum activity levels of D‑lactate, diamine oxidase and endotoxin, and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and 8‑iso‑prostaglandin F2α (8‑iso‑PGF2α). The protein expression levels of p85, phosphorylated (p)‑p85, protein kinase B (Akt), p‑Akt and nuclear factor erythroid 2‑related factor 2 (Nrf2) were determined via western blotting, and the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α), interleukin (IL)‑1β and IL‑6 were measured via ELISA. It was revealed that IIR led to severe intestinal injury (as determined by significant increases in intestinal Chiu scores), which was accompanied with disruptions in the  of the intestinal mucosal . IIR also increased the expression levels of TNF‑α, IL‑1β, IL‑6, MDA and 8‑iso‑PGF2α in the intestine, and decreased those of SOD. GRb1 reduced intestinal histological injury, and suppressed inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. Additionally, the protective effects of GRb1 were eliminated by WM. These findings indicated that GRb1 may ameliorate IIR injury by activating the PI3K/protein kinase B/Nrf2 pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755137>Deficiency of Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor Type 2 Limits Brain Edema Formation after Traumatic Brain Injury.</a></h1><p>Plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2/SerpinB2) inhibits extracellular urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). Under physiological conditions, PAI-2 is expressed at low levels but is rapidly induced by inflammatory triggers. It is a negative regulator of fibrinolysis and serves to stabilize clots. In the present study, PAI-2 expression is upregulated 25-fold in pericontusional brain tissue at 6 h after traumatic brain injury (TBI), with a maximum increase of 87-fold at 12 h. To investigate a potentially detrimental influence of PAI-2 on secondary post-traumatic processes, male PAI-2-deficient (PAI-2-KO) and wild-type mice (WT) were subjected to TBI by controlled cortical impact injury. Brain lesion volume and cerebral inflammation were not different. Total brain volume was significantly smaller in PAI-2-KO, indicating reduced brain swelling. The brain water content at 24 h post-insult was significantly smaller in PAI-2-KO mice. Markers of vasogenic brain edema showed no difference in blood-brain   and expression of blood-brain  proteins (claudin-, zonula occludens-1). In contrast to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), PAI-2 plays a limited role for brain lesion formation and does not influence blood-brain  . PAI-2 contributes to brain edema formation and could therefore be a promising new target to treat post-traumatic brain edema.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559067>Lipoxin A4 ameliorates alveolar fluid clearance disturbance in lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury via aquaporin  and MAPK signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>A characteristic of acute lung injury (ALI) is the inflammatory damage of alveolar fluid transport. Lipoxins are endogenous lipids involving in the resolution of inflammation. It is found that lipoxin A4 (LXA4) has the distinct properties to improve the anti-edema and pro-resolution function in inflammation. Since aquaporins (AQPs) have essential roles in the  of  function during fluid transport, especially AQP5 in the maintaining of the epithelium permeability, the current study is aimed to evaluate the potential role of LXA4 in regulating alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) during fluid transport and the corresponding change of AQP5 in the lung.ALI was induced by the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneal injection, and LXA4 treatment was given 8 hours after LPS administration. We investigated changes in the capacity of AFC, pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the severity of ALI. Then AQP5 expression in lung tissue and potential regulatory pathways in LPS-induced ALI was explored.LXA4 treatment was found to inhibit AFC capacity, inflammatory cytokine release, partially, alleviate ALI severity, and restored AQP5 expression partially. Additionally, we found that LXA4 played a protective role by the inhibition of the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK.In summary, our results suggest that LXA4 plays a protective role in lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI by restoring AFC capacity and upregulating AQP5 expression and inhibiting the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK. These findings suggest potential new mechanism of LXA4 as anti-inflammation therapy for the impairment of alveolar fluid transport in ALI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31211250>Role of sunscreen formulation and photostability to protect the biomechanical  function of skin.</a></h1><p>The impact of sunscreen formulations on the  properties of human skin are often overlooked leading to formulations with components whose effects on  mechanical  are poorly understood. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the relevance of carrier selection and sunscreen photostability when designing sunscreen formulations to protect the biomechanical  properties of human stratum corneum (SC) from solar ultraviolet (UV) damage. Biomechanical properties of SC samples were assayed after accelerated UVB damage through measurements of the SC's mechanical stress profile and corneocyte cohesion. A narrowband UVB (305-315 nm) lamp was used to expose SC samples to , 30, 125, and 265 J cm in order to magnify damage to the mechanical properties of the tissue and characterize the UV degradation dose response such that effects from smaller UV dosages can be extrapolated. Stresses in the SC decreased when treated with sunscreen components, highlighting their effect on the skin prior to UV exposure. Stresses increased with UVB exposure and in specimens treated with different sunscreens stresses varied dramatically at high UVB dosages. Specimens treated with sunscreen components without UVB exposure exhibited altered corneocyte cohesion. Both sunscreens studied prevented alteration of corneocyte cohesion by low UVB dosages, but differences in protection were observed at higher UVB dosages indicating UV degradation of one sunscreen. These results indicate the protection of individual sunscreen components vary over a range of UVB dosages, and components can even cause alteration of the biomechanical  properties of human SC before UV exposure. Therefore, detailed characterization of sunscreen formulation components is required to design robust protection from UV damage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31331382>A combined epigenome- and transcriptome-wide association study of the oral masticatory mucosa assigns CYP1B1 a central role for epithelial health in smokers.</a></h1><p>The oral mucosa has an important role in maintaining   at the gateway to the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Smoking is a strong environmental risk factor for the common oral inflammatory disease periodontitis and oral cancer. Cigarette smoke affects gene methylation and expression in various tissues. This is the first epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) that aimed to identify biologically active methylation marks of the oral masticatory mucosa that are associated with smoking.Ex vivo biopsies of 18 current smokers and 21 never smokers were analysed with the Infinium Methylation EPICBeadChip and combined with whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq; 16 mio reads per sample) of the same samples. We analysed the associations of CpG methylation values with cigarette smoking and smoke pack year (SPY) levels in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Nine CpGs were significantly associated with smoking status, with three CpGs mapping to the genetic region of CYP1B1 (cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B member 1; best p = . × 10) and two mapping to AHRR (aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor; best p = .9 × 10). In the SPY analysis, 61 CpG sites at 52 loci showed significant associations of the quantity of smoking with changes in methylation values. Here, the most significant association located to the gene CYP1B1, with p = 4.0 × 10. RNA-Seq data showed significantly increased expression of CYP1B1 in smokers compared to non-smokers (p = 2.2 × 10), together with 13 significantly upregulated transcripts. Six transcripts were significantly downregulated. No differential expression was observed for AHRR. In vitro studies with gingival fibroblasts showed that cigarette smoke extract directly upregulated the expression of CYP1B1.This study validated the established role of CYP1B1 and AHRR in xenobiotic metabolism of tobacco smoke and highlights the importance of epigenetic regulation for these genes. For the first time, we give evidence of this role for the oral masticatory mucosa.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906943>Influence of the Maillard-type caseinate glycation with lactose on the intestinal  activity of the caseinate digest in IEC-6 cells.</a></h1><p>Protein glycation via the Maillard reaction has been used excessively in recent years to modify protein properties. A milk protein caseinate can be glycated with lactose through this Maillard reaction. In this study, two tryptic digests from the lactose-glycated caseinate and commercial caseinate were assessed and compared for their activities in the intestinal  function of a non-transformed small intestine epithelial cell line (IEC-6 cells) as a cell model, to assess if this glycation might have positive or negative impact on caseinate biofunctions. Cell treatment with the two digests led to promoted cell growth by 103.1-130.9 (24 h) or 106.4-133.2% (48 h). More importantly, the two digests improved intestinal epithelial  , reflected by the increased trans-epithelial electrical resistance values of 109.0-123.6 (24 h) or 112.-127.8% (48 h), decreased epithelial permeability by 75.1-94.4 (24 h) or 64.0-83.4% (48 h), reduced bacterial translocation in the cells, and exhibited higher antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. Furthermore, the results from the conducted immuno-fluorescence, qPCR, and western-blot assays indicated that the two digests enhanced the expression levels of 6 tight junction proteins ZO-1, ZO-2, occludin, claudin-1, claudin-3, and claudin-4 in the cells. However, the data comparison results also showed that the lactose-glycated caseinate digest always showed lower efficiency than the caseinate digest to improve the intestinal epithelial  function of this cell model. Thus, the present results highlight that the Maillard-type lactose glycation of caseinate gives the resultant tryptic digest with impaired activities in the intestinal epithelial  function of this cell model, suggesting that another adverse effect of the Maillard reaction on food proteins should be reconsidered and revised.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31046824>Low plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein M are associated with disease activity and endothelial dysfunction in systemic lupus erythematosus.</a></h1><p>Apolipoprotein M (apoM) is a 25-kDa apolipoprotein present in % of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. It is suggested to be anti-atherogenic and to play a key role in sustaining endothelial  . SLE patients have increased cardiovascular disease risk, and we aimed to investigate if apoM levels reflect endothelial function in SLE. Since apoM plasma levels decrease during inflammatory conditions, our aim was also to determine the impact of SLE disease activity on apoM plasma levels.Plasma concentrations of apoM were measured by ELISA in two patient groups with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and in 79 healthy control individuals. In patient group I (n = 84), evaluation time points were selected with the objective to include a wide range of clinical and laboratory variables reflecting disease activity which was measured as SLEDAI. In patient group II consisting of 140 consecutive patients, endothelial function was measured by a finger plethysmograph. A low Reactive Hyperemia Index (RHI) value indicates endothelial dysfunction.SLE patients had decreased levels of apoM compared to healthy controls (p < 0.01), with apoM levels correlating inversely with SLEDAI (r = - 0.31, p < 0.01) as well as with levels of CRP (r = - 0.26, p = 0.02) and positively with levels of C3 (r = 0.29, p < 0.01). ApoM levels were particularly low in patients with active disease from the kidney and skin and in patients with leukopenia or positive anti-dsDNA antibody test (p < 0.05). ApoM levels correlated with RHI values in young SLE patients (r = 0.32, p = 0.01), consistent with the important role of apoM in regulating endothelial .ApoM levels may be regulated by SLE-related inflammatory processes and could be a marker of disease activity and endothelial dysfunction, in particular in young SLE patients.

Herein, hydrogenation-induced self-assembly of robust Al nanocrystals with high purity that are uniformly anchored on graphene is demonstrated. The strong molecular interaction between Al and graphene can not only thermodynamically facilitate the homogenous distribution of Al on graphene but also effectively alleviate the volume changes and preserve the structural  of the electrode. More importantly, density functional theory calculations reveal that the absence of oxidation can lower the energy  for Li diffusion inside the Al matrix to less than 1/6 of that in an Al matrix with only one monolayer coverage of oxygen. These unique structural features enable the aluminum/graphene nanosheets (Al@GNs) electrode to realize a high reversible capacity of 1219 mAh g and an excellent cycling stability with capacity of 766 mAh g after 1000 cycles at the 3 A g rate. Furthermore, a full cell, comprising an Al@GNs anode and LiFePO cathode, exhibits remarkable capacity retention of 96.4% after 100 cycles at the 0. A g rate.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the current study, we focused on molecular mechanisms responsible for systemic and localized anti-inflammatory phenotypes of ChAT tg. ChAT tg were resistant to systemic inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharides due to an attenuated cytokine response. In addition, ChAT tg, originally equipped with less reactive Kupffer cells, were refractory to brain cold injury, with decreased blood brain  (BBB) permeability and reduced inflammation. This is because ChAT tg brain endothelial cells expressed more claudin-, and their astrocytes were less reactive, causing decreased hypertrophy. Moreover, reconstruction of the BBB  in vitro confirmed the consolidation of ChAT tg. ChAT tg were also resistant to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) neuronal toxicity due to lower mortality rate and neuronal loss of substantia nigra. Additionally, ChAT tg subjected to MPTP showed attenuated BBB disruption, as evident from reduced sodium fluorescein levels in the brain parenchyma. The activated central cholinergic pathway of ChAT tg lead to anti-convulsive effects like vagus nerve stimulation. However, DSP-4, a noradrenergic neuron-selective neurotoxin against the CNS including the locus ceruleus, abrogated the beneficial phenotype and vagotomy attenuated expression of claudin-, suggesting the link between the cholinergic pathway and BBB function. Altogether, these findings indicate that ChAT tg possess an anti-inflammatory response potential, associated with upregulated claudin-, leading to the consolidation of BBB . These characteristics protect ChAT tg against systemic and localized inflammatory pathological disorders, which targets the CNS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Tight junctions (TJs) are essential to maintain intestinal . L-Arginine has beneficial effects on gut functions. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that L-arginine regulates the TJ network by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, which in turn improves intestinal  functions under HS. IEC-6 cells and rat small intestines were used as experiment models of heat stress. AICAR and dorsomorphin were used to activate and inhibit the AMPK pathway, respectively. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, differential gene expression and KEGG pathway analysis, intestinal paracellular permeability, intestinal morphology, and expression of HSP and TJ proteins, and p-AMPK were determined. L-Arginine promoted cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis after heat exposure at an optimal concentration of  mmol. Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes associated with the HSP family and TJs were elevated by L-arginine. According to KEGG pathway analysis, L-arginine activated the AMPK signaling pathway. In vivo, intestinal damage resulted in obvious morphological changes as well as apoptosis with TUNEL and caspase-3 staining under HS and dorsomorphin treatments. Furthermore, HS and dorsomorphin increased the serum D-lactate concentration, diamine oxidase activity, and mRNA expression level of MLCK (P < 0.05). In contrast, L-arginine and AICAR treatments reduced intestinal injury, maintained intestinal permeability, and increased the villus/crypt ratio under hyperthermia. L-Arginine had the same effect as AICAR both in vitro and in vivo, namely increasing p-AMPK protein expression. L-Arginine and AICAR also upregulated the mRNA expression level of HSP70 and HSP90, and downregulated mRNA expression of MLCK (P < 0.05). The protein expression levels of TJ proteins ZO-1 and claudin-1 were suppressed by heat stroke and dorsomorphin, but enhanced by L-arginine and AICAR. Our findings indicate that activation of AMPK signaling by L-arginine is associated with improved intestinal mucosal  functions by enhancing the expression of TJs in rat small intestines and IEC-6 cells during HS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735221>Red wine extract preserves tight junctions in intestinal epithelial cells under inflammatory conditions: implications for intestinal inflammation.</a></h1><p>The altered expression and subcellular distribution of tight junction (TJ) proteins, leading to a dysfunctional intestinal , is a key mechanistic feature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therefore, increasing the  of the intestinal  by manipulating the TJ may constitute an innovative and effective therapeutic strategy in IBD. In this context, recent studies showed that dietary polyphenols are able to protect the intestinal TJ  . Here, using a cellular model of intestinal inflammation, consisting of cytokine-stimulated HT-29 colon epithelial cells, we show that a polyphenolic extract obtained from Portuguese red wine (RWE) decreased the paracellular permeability across the cell monolayer compared with the control cells, even in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The beneficial effect of RWE was exerted at three complementary levels: (1) by promoting a significant increase of the mRNA of key -forming TJ proteins, including occludin, claudin- and zonnula occludens (ZO)-1 above the levels observed in the control cells; (2) by preventing the decrease in the expression of these proteins under inflammatory conditions and (3) by averting the increase in claudin-2 mRNA, a channel-forming TJ protein induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that polyphenols presented and consumed in red wine as a mixture can reinforce and protect the intestinal  against inflammatory stimulus by affecting the TJ protein expression and, thus, without the need for purifying individual compounds, might represent a readily available therapeutic intervention against IBD and intestinal inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040055>Epstein-Barr Virus dUTPase Induces Neuroinflammatory Mediators: Implications for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.</a></h1><p>Neuroinflammation is a common feature in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), affecting 85%-90% of all patients, yet the underlying mechanism or mechanisms responsible for the initiation and/or promotion of this process is largely unknown. Multiple reports, however, have suggested a role for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), in particular, in ME/CFS, but its potential role, if any, in the neuroinflammatory process has not been addressed.

We also found that a small subset of patients with ME/CFS exhibited prolonged and significantly elevated neutralizing antibodies against EBV dUTPase protein in serum, which inversely correlated with ME/CFS symptoms. A larger ME/CFS case-control cohort study further confirmed that a significant percentage of patients with ME/CFS (30.91%-52.7%) were simultaneously producing antibodies against multiple human herpesviruses-encoded dUTPases and/or human dUTPase. Altogether, these findings suggest that EBV dUTPase protein may be involved in the neuroinflammatory process observed in ME/CFS. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the EBV dUTPase protein could contribute to neuroinflammation by altering the expression of genes involved with maintaining blood-brain  (BBB)  and/or modulating synaptic plasticity.With the use of human immortalized astrocytes, microglia, and cerebral microvascular endothelial cells, we conducted time-course (0-24 h) experiments with EBV dUTPase protein (10 μg/mL) to determine what effect(s) it may have on the expression of genes involved with BBB permeability, astrocytes and microglia cell function, tryptophan metabolism, and synaptic plasticity by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In parallel, in vivo studies were conducted in female C57Bl/6 mice. Mice were injected by the intraperitoneal route with EBV dUTPase protein (10 μg) or vehicle daily for  days, and the brains were collected and processed for further qRT-PCR analysis of the in vivo effect of the dUTPase on the dopamine/serotonin and γ-aminobutyric acid/glutamate pathways, which are important for brain function, using RT Profiler PCR Arrays.EBV dUTPase protein altered the expression in vitro (12 of 15 genes and 32 of 1000 proteins examined) and in vivo (34 of 84 genes examined) of targets with central roles in BBB /function, fatigue, pain synapse structure, and function, as well as tryptophan, dopamine, and serotonin metabolism.The data suggest that in a subset of patients with ME/CFS, the EBV dUTPase could initiate a neuroinflammatory reaction, which contributes to the fatigue, excessive pain, and cognitive impairments observed in these patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The mRNA and protein expression of CXCL16 and CXCR6 was detected after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation with or without treatment with the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). Lung injury induced by LPS was evaluated in CXCR6 knockout mice. CXCL16 level was elevated in the serum of ALI patients (n = 20) compared with healthy controls (n = 30). CXCL16 treatment (50, 100, and 200 ng/mL) in 16HBE cells significantly decreased the epithelial   and E-cadherin expression, and increased CXCR6 expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and p38 phosphorylation. Knockdown of CXCR6 or treatment with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 abolished the effects of CXCL16. Moreover, treatment of 16HBE cells with LPS (, 10, 20 and 50 μg/mL) significantly increased CXCL16 release as well as the mRNA and protein levels of CXCL16 and CXCR6. The effects of LPS treatment (20 μg/mL) were abolished by treatment with PDTC. The results of the luciferase assay further demonstrated that PDTC treatment markedly inhibited the activity of the CXCL16 promoter. In conclusion, CXCL16, whose transcription was enhanced by LPS, may be involved in ROS production, epithelial  dysfunction and E-cadherin down-regulation via p38 signalling, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of ALI. Importantly, CXCR6 knockout or inhibition of p38 signalling may protect mice from LPS-induced lung injury by decreasing E-cadherin expression.© 2019 The Authors.

Chronic neuroinflammation in tauopathies is driven by glial cells that potentially trigger the disruption of the blood-brain  (BBB). Pro-inflammatory signaling molecules such as cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules produced by glial cells, neurons and endothelial cells, in general, cooperate to determine the  of BBB by influencing vascular permeability, enhancing migration of immune cells and altering transport systems. We considered the effect of tau about vascular permeability of peripheral blood cells in vitro and in vivo using primary rat BBB model and transgenic rat model expressing misfolded truncated protein tau. Immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy and transcriptomic analysis were employed to characterize the structural and functional changes in BBB manifested by neurofibrillary pathology in a transgenic model. Our results show that misfolded protein tau ultimately modifies the endothelial properties of BBB, facilitating blood-to-brain cell transmigration. Our results suggest that the increased diapedesis of peripheral cells across the BBB, in response to tau protein, could be mediated by the increased expression of endothelial signaling molecules, namely ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and selectins. We suggest that the compensation of BBB in the diseased brain represents a crucial factor in neurodegeneration of human tauopathies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31086953>Recent advances in intestinal alkaline phosphatase, inflammation, and nutrition.</a></h1><p>In recent years, much new data on intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) have been published, and major breakthroughs have been disclosed. The aim of the present review is to critically analyze the publications released over the last  years. These breakthroughs include, for example, the direct implication of IAP in intestinal tight junction  and  function maintenance; chronic intestinal challenge with low concentrations of Salmonella generating long-lasting depletion of IAP and increased susceptibility to inflammation; the suggestion that genetic mutations in the IAP gene in humans contribute to some forms of chronic inflammatory diseases and loss of functional IAP along the gut and in stools; stool IAP as an early biomarker of incipient diabetes in humans; and omega-3 fatty acids as direct inducers of IAP in intestinal tissue. Many recent papers have also explored the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of IAP and other alkaline phosphatase (AP) isoforms in various experimental settings and diseases. Remarkably, nearly all data confirm the potent anti-inflammatory properties of (I)AP and the negative consequences of its inhibition on health. A simplified model of the body AP system integrating the IAP compartment is provided. Finally, the list of nutrients and food components stimulating IAP has continued to grow, thus emphasizing nutrition as a potent lever for limiting inflammation.© The Author(s) 2019.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of specific chemical inhibitors of Nox2 and Nox4 on cerebral I/R-induced brain injury in rats.At 0. h before MCAO surgery, the rats were pretreated with vehicle, Nox2 inhibitor (gp91ds-tat), and Nox4 inhibitor (GKT137831), respectively. After reperfusion for 24 h, the infarct sizes of brain tissues in rats in various groups are determined. The penumbra (ischemic) tissues are collected to measure ROS levels, neuronal apoptosis, and degeneration, as well as the  of the blood-brain  (BBB) in brain tissues of rats.gp91ds-tat and GKT137831 pretreatment significantly reduced the infarct sizes in brain tissues of rats, effectively suppressed I/R-induced increase in ROS levels, neuronal apoptosis and degeneration, and obviously alleviated BBB damage.Under cerebral I/R conditions, Nox2 inhibitor (gp91ds-tat) and Nox4 inhibitor (GKT137831) can effectively play a protective role in the brain tissues of rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30800720>MRI phenotypes in MS: Longitudinal changes and miRNA signatures.</a></h1><p>To classify and immunologically characterize persons with MS based on brain lesions and atrophy and their associated microRNA profiles.Cerebral T2-hyperintense lesion volume (T2LV) and brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) were quantified and used to define MRI phenotypes as follows: type I: low T2LV, low atrophy; type II: high T2LV, low atrophy; type III: low T2LV, high atrophy; type IV: high T2LV, high atrophy, in a large cross-sectional cohort (n = 1,088) and a subset with -year lngitudinal follow-up (n = 153). Serum miRNAs were assessed on a third MS cohort with 2-year MRI phenotype stability (n = 98).One-third of the patients had lesion-atrophy dissociation (types II or III) in both the cross-sectional and longitudinal cohorts. At  years, all phenotypes had progressive atrophy ( < 0.001), disproportionally in type II (BPF -2.28%). Only type IV worsened in physical disability. Types I and II showed a -year MRI phenotype conversion rate of 33% and 46%, whereas III and IV had >90% stability. Type II switched primarily to IV (91%); type I switched primarily to II (47%) or III (37%). Baseline higher age ( = 0.006) and lower BPF ( < 0.001) predicted -year phenotype conversion. Each MRI phenotype demonstrated an miRNA signature whose underlying biology implicates blood-brain  pathology: hsa.miR.22.3p, hsa.miR.361.5p, and hsa.miR.345.5p were the most valid differentiators of MRI phenotypes.MRI-defined MS phenotypes show high conversion rates characterized by the continuation of either predominant neurodegeneration or inflammation and support the partial independence of these 2 measures.

IL-22 promotes S. aureus and S. pneumoniae host defense in the lung through epithelial integrity and induction of antimicrobial peptides and is inhibited by the soluble decoy receptor IL-22-binding protein (IL-22BP). Little is known about the effect of the IL-22/IL-22BP regulatory pathway on lung infection, and it has not been studied in the setting of super-infection. We exposed wild-type and IL-22BP mice to influenza A/PR/8/34 for 6 days prior to infection with S. aureus (USA300) S. pneumoniae. Super-infected IL-22BP mice had decreased bacterial burden and improved survival compared to controls. IL-22BP mice exhibited decreased inflammation, increased lipocalin 2 expression, and deletion of IL-22BP was associated with preserved epithelial   with evidence of improved tight junction stability. Human bronchial epithelial cells treated with IL-22Fc showed evidence of improved tight junctions compared to untreated cells. This study revealed that IL-22BP mice are protected during influenza, bacterial super-infection, suggesting that IL-22BP has a pro-inflammatory role and impairs epithelial   likely through interaction with IL-22.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31502457>Heterometallic RuCo [2 × 2] Grid with Localized Single Molecule Magnet Behavior.</a></h1><p>Metal complexes with a [n × n] gridlike structure are discussed as attractive building blocks for various materials chemistry applications in molecular nanotechnology and electronics, which often rely on the grids' magnetic and redox properties. Most of the known metallogrids are homometallic, though heterometallic systems that comprise two or more different metals promise higher level functionalities. However, heterometallic [n × n] grids are relatively rare, mostly because of the more challenging synthetic strategies. To that end a new heterometallic [2 × 2] grid complex [LRuCo](BF) () based on a known pyrazolate-bridged bis(tridentate) compartmental N-donor ligand [L] is presented in this work, along with its doubly oxidized congener [LRuCo](BF) (). In order to prevent scrambling of the different metal ions, a stepwise synthetic approach was implemented in which an inert Ru "corner complex" [(HL)Ru](BF) () was isolated first, followed by addition of the more labile Co. This exclusively yields the desired [LRuCo] with -topology, viz., with the Ru and Co ions situated at opposite corners of the [2 × 2] grid, as confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction.  can be sequentially oxidized four times, first at the Co vertices and then at the Ru vertices. H NMR spectroscopy as well as ESI mass spectrometry evidenced  of the [LRuCo] grids in solution. Structural and magnetic analyses revealed that paramagnetic  features LS-Ru and HS-Co ions (LS = low-spin, HS = high-spin) whereas LS-Ru and LS-Co ions are present in diamagnetic . The LS-Ru ions in  serve to magnetically isolate the HS-Co whose coordination geometry is strongly distorted from octahedral. A large and negative axial zero-field splitting value ( = -64 cm) for the local  = 3/2 ions is shown to lead to single molecule magnetic (SMM) properties characterized by a  to spin inversion of  = 8.8 cm and a single relaxation process with τ = 3.1 × 10 s. Transition metal [2 × 2] grid complexes showing SMM behavior are extremely rare, and this is the first heterometallic 3d/4d grid system featuring such a magnetic signature.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337338>Protective effect of silencing Stat1 on high glucose-induced podocytes injury via Forkhead transcription factor O1-regulated the oxidative stress response.</a></h1><p>Podocyte plays an important role in maintaining the integrity and  of the glomerular filtration . Various studies reported that forkhead transcription factor (Fox) O1 played a key role in anti-oxidative signaling. This study aimed to investigate the role of Stat1 in high glucose (HG) -induced podocyte injury.Under normal glucose, hypertonic and HG stimulated podocyte conditions, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, flow cytometry and western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were respectively carried out to determine cell viability, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and related genes expressions. We then respectively used silent Stat1, simultaneous silencing Stat1 and FoxO1 and over-expression of FoxO1, to observe whether they/it could reverse the damage of podocytes induced by HG.High glucose attenuated cell survival and promoted cell apoptosis in MPC- cells at the same time, and it was also observed to promote the protein expression of Stat1 and the FoxO1 expression inhibition. Silencing Stat1 could reverse HG-induced podocytes injury. Specifically, siStat1 increased cell viability, inhibited cell apoptosis and attenuated ROS level in a high-glucose environment. Cleaved caspase-3 and pro-apoptosis protein Bax was significantly down-regulated, and anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 was up-regulated by siStat1. The antioxidant genes Catalase, MnSOD, NQO1 and HO1 were up-regulated by siStat1. We found that silencing FoxO1 reversed the protective effect of siStat1 on the HG-induced podocytes injury.Silencing Stat1 could reverse the effects of high glucose-triggered low cell viability, cell apoptosis and ROS release and the functions of Stat1 might be involved in FoxO1 mediated-oxidative stress in nucleus.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30984353>Anti-inflammatory effect of Lycium barbarum on polarized human intestinal epithelial cells.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) has rapidly escalated in Asia (including Korea) due to increasing westernized diet patterns subsequent to industrialization. Factors associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are demonstrated to be one of the major causes of IBD. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of  () on ER stress.Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line and polarized Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cells were treated with crude extract of the  fruit (LF). Paracellular permeability was measured to examine the effect of tight junction (TJ) . The regulatory pathways of ER stress were evaluated in MEF knockout (KO) cell lines by qPCR for interleukin (IL) 6, IL8 and XBP1 spliced form (XBP1s). Immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP), XBP1s and CCAAT/enhancer-binding homologous protein (CHOP) expressions were measured by RT-PCR. Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy (SICM) at high resolution was applied to observe morphological changes after treatments.Exposure to LF extract strengthened the TJ, both in the presence and absence of inflammation. In polarized Caco-2 pretreated with LF, induction in the expression of proinflammatory marker IL8 was not significant, whereas ER stress marker XBP1s expression was significantly increased. In wild type (wt) MEF cells, IL6, CHOP and XBP1 spliced form were dose-dependently induced when exposed to 12.-50 µg/mL extract. However, absence of XBP1 or IRE1α in MEF cells abolished this effect.Results of this study show that LF treatment enhances the  function and reduces inflammation and ER stress in an IRE1α-XBP1-dependent manner. These results suggest the preventive effect of LF on healthy intestine, and the possibility of reducing the degree of inflammatory symptoms in IBD patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30766877>Optimizing Gastrointestinal  in Poultry: The Role of Nutrients and Feed Additives.</a></h1><p>Immunomodulation of the immune system by stimulating or suppressing one or both arms, is an emerging concept driven by the understanding of the host defense system. In particular, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) functions not only as a site for digestion and absorption of nutrients but also acts as a metabolic and immunological organ. This serves as a  against abnormal presentation of luminal constituents, caused by dysfunctional intestinal epithelial , to the mucosal immune system. Invasion by pathogens in the case of disease or stress or a massive influx of commensal bacteria overcomes the defensive mechanisms, resulting in the full activation of local dendritic cells and the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines. A growing body of literature demonstrates the immune benefits of increasing the intake of specific nutrients. This strategy involves formulating diets that encompass the bioavailability and utilization of nutrients from various food sources and understanding the dynamics of the macro and micronutrients to support all physiological functions as well as maintaining the function of the immune cells. The nature and type of feed ingredients may also play some roles on the  of the GIT of birds. Because dietary intake or nutritional status as well as nutrient requirements may be altered as a result of disease or stress, this may eventually alter the gut microflora and intestinal mucosal , resulting in a compromised  of the intestinal epithelium. The weakening of the intestinal  could result in an increase in bacterial adherence to the mucosa, bacterial translocation, susceptibility to opportunistic bacterial infection, and mis-appropriation of nutrients. In this chapter, we will discuss the role of dietary energy and nutrients as substrates that have the potential to influence GIT's health and  and their roles, directly or indirectly, in modulating bird's ability to be resilient or resist infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30590156>Impairing of gill health through decreasing immune function and structural  of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) fed graded levels dietary lipids after challenged with Flavobacterium columnare.</a></h1><p>The current study conducted to investigate the hypothesis that low or excess levels of lipids increased the gill rot morbidity through impairing the immune function and structural  in the gill of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). A total of 540 young grass carp with an average initial weight of 261.41 ± 0.53 g were fed diets containing six graded levels of lipids at 0.59%, 2.14%, 3.60%, .02%, 6.66% and 8.01% diets for 8 weeks. After the growth trial, fish were challenged with Flavobacterium columnare for 3 days. The results indicated that compared with optimal lipids supplementation (2.14%-8.01% lipids diets), low or excess levels of lipids impaired fish immune function through declining the activities of humoral compounds, down-regulated the mRNA levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, inhibitor of κBα (IκBα) and ribosomal p70S6 kinase (S6K1), and up-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor κB p65 (NF-κB p65) (not p52), IκB kinase α (IKKα) (not IKKβ), IKKγ and eIF4E-binding protein (4EBP) in the gill of young grass carp. In addition, low or excess levels of lipids decreased young grass carp physical  function through down-regulating the mRNA levels of ZO-1 (rather than ZO-2b), Claudin b, c, 3, 12, 15a, 15b, 7b, 7a and Occludin through MAPKK 6/p38 MAPK/MLCK signaling molecules, decreasing antioxidant ability via Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1a (Keap1a)/NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling molecules, and down-regulating the mRNA levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) and up-regulating the mRNA levels of apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), Caspase-3, -8 and -9 and Fas ligand (FasL) in the gill of grass carp. Based on the quadratic regression analysis for the gill rot morbidity, C3 and MDA contents, the dietary lipids requirements for young grass carp have been estimated to be .60%, 6.01% and 4.58% diets.Copyright © 2018.

Bis-2-(-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl) ethyl sulfide (BPTES) is a glutaminase 1 (Gls1) inhibitor with the dual functions of increasing glutamine levels and immune regulation. In this study, we focused on the role of BPTES in CD-like enteritis and the possible mechanisms. We found that Gls1 expression was significantly increased in CD intestinal tissue compared with control tissue. Bis-2-(-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl) ethyl sulfide treatment significantly ameliorated chronic colitis in the IL-10 , as manifested by decreased disease activity index, body weight change, histological inflammatory degree and inflammatory cytokine expression. Bis-2-(-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl) ethyl sulfide treatment exerted protective effects on CD that were associated with the maintenance of intestinal   and the Th/Treg balance. Bis-2-(-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl) ethyl sulfide treatment may act in part through TCR-mediated mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling activation. In conclusion, inhibition of Gls1 expression attenuated chronic colitis by maintaining intestinal   and the Th/Treg balance, thereby ameliorating CD-like colitis.© 2019 The Authors.

However, the underlying mechanisms require further investigation.The aim of this study was to determine the role of butyrate, an SCFA, in the regulation of obesity, low-grade chronic inflammation, and alterations of microbiota composition in mice.Male C57BL/6J mice, 4- wk of age, were divided into 3 groups (n = 8 mice/group): low-fat diet (LFD; 10% energy from fat), high-fat diet (HFD; 45% energy from fat), or high-fat diet plus sodium butyrate (HSB). HSB mice received sodium butyrate at a concentration of 0.1 M in drinking water for 12 wk. Measures of inflammation, obesity, and intestinal  were assessed. Serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations were measured in the 3 groups. Fecal samples were collected for gut microbiota analysis.In HFD mice, body weight gain and hepatic triglyceride (TG), serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), and serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels were 1-4 times higher than those in LFD mice (P < 0.05); they were 34-42% lower in HSB mice compared with HFD mice (P < 0.05). The HFD group had 28%-48% lower mRNA expression of both Tjp1 and Ocln in the ileum and colon compared with levels in LFD or HSB mice (P < 0.05), whereas there was no difference in expression levels between LFD and HSB mice. Furthermore, in HSB mice, serum LPS concentration was 53% lower compared with that in HFD mice but still 23% higher than that in LFD mice (P < 0.05). Results from principal component analysis showed that HSB and LFD mice had a similar gut microbiota structure, which was significantly different from that in HFD mice (P < 0.05).Sodium butyrate administration beneficially changed HFD-induced gut microbiota composition and improved intestinal , leading to lower serum LPS concentrations. These changes may correspond with improvements in obesity-related lipid accumulation and low-grade chronic inflammation.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31210034>Understanding Bile Acid Signaling in Diabetes: From Pathophysiology to Therapeutic Targets.</a></h1><p>Diabetes and obesity have reached an epidemic status worldwide. Diabetes increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Primary bile acids are synthesized in hepatocytes and are transformed to secondary bile acids in the intestine by gut bacteria. Bile acids are nutrient sensors and metabolic integrators that regulate lipid, glucose, and energy homeostasis by activating nuclear farnesoid X receptor and membrane Takeda G protein-coupled receptor . Bile acids control gut bacteria overgrowth, species population, and protect the  of the intestinal . Gut bacteria, in turn, control circulating bile acid composition and pool size. Dysregulation of bile acid homeostasis and dysbiosis causes diabetes and obesity.

The tight junction protein claudin- (CLDN5) is a crucial protein necessary for BBB  and maintenance. CLDN5 is negatively regulated by the transcriptional repressor FOXO1, whose activity increases during impaired insulin/AKT signaling. Owing to an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that regulate CLDN5 expression in BBB maintenance and dysfunction, therapeutic interventions remain underdeveloped. Here, we show a novel isoform-specific function for AKT2 in maintenance of BBB . We identified that AKT2 during homeostasis specifically regulates CLDN5-dependent   in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs) and that intervention with a selective insulin-receptor (IR) agonist, demethylasterriquinone B1 (DMAQ-B1), rescued IL-1β-induced AKT2 inactivation, FOXO1 nuclear accumulation, and loss of CLDN5-dependent  . Moreover, DMAQ-B1 attenuated preclinical CLDN5-dependent BBB dysfunction in mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Taken together, the data suggest a regulatory role for IR/AKT2/FOXO1-signaling in CLDN5 expression and BBB  during neuroinflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684007>Postnatal development of the astrocyte perivascular MLC1/GlialCAM complex defines a temporal window for the gliovascular unit maturation.</a></h1><p>Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells of the central nervous system are morphologically complex. They display numerous processes interacting with synapses and blood vessels. At the vascular interface, astrocyte endfeet-terminated processes almost entirely cover the blood vessel surface and participate to the gliovascular unit where important vascular properties of the brain are set such as the blood-brain  (BBB) . How specific morphological and functional interactions between astrocytes and the vascular compartment develop has not been fully investigated. Here, we elaborated an original experimental strategy to study the postnatal development of astrocyte perivascular endfeet. Using purified gliovascular units, we focused on the postnatal expression of MLC1 and GlialCAM, two transmembrane proteins forming a complex enriched at the junction between mature astrocyte perivascular endfeet. We showed that MLC1 and GlialCAM were enriched and assembled into mature complexes in astrocyte perivascular endfeet between postnatal days 10 and 15, after the formation of astrocyte perivascular Aquaporin 4 water channels. These events correlated with the increased expression of Claudin- and P-gP, two endothelial-specific BBB components. These results illustrate for the first time that astrocyte perivascular endfeet differentiation is a complex and progressive process which correlates with BBB maturation. Moreover, our results suggest that maturation of the astrocyte endfeet MLC1/GlialCAM complex between postnatal days 10 and 15 might be a key event in the gliovascular unit maturation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30896813>Targeting bacterial quorum sensing shows promise in improving intestinal  function following burn‑site infection.</a></h1><p>Burn‑site infections, commonly due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have been associated with deranged intestinal , allowing bacteria and their products to translocate from the gut to the circulatory system. The P. aeruginosa quorum sensing (QS) transcription factor MvfR (PqsR) controls the expression of numerous virulence factors, and the synthesis of several toxic products. However, the role of QS in intestinal  alterations, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously investigated. Using a proven anti‑MvfR, anti‑virulence agent, the in vivo results of the present study revealed that inhibition of MvfR function significantly decreased Fluorescein Isothiocyanate‑Dextran (FITC‑Dextran) flow from the intestine to the systemic circulation, diminished bacterial translocation from the intestine to mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), and improved tight junction  in thermally injured and infected mice. In addition, the MvfR antagonist administration alleviates the intestinal inflammation, as demonstrated by reduced ileal TNF‑α and fecal lipocalin‑2 concentrations. In addition, it is associated with lower levels of circulating endotoxin and decreased P. aeruginosa dissemination from the burn wound to the ileum. Collectively, these results hold great promise that the inhibition of this QS system mitigates gut hyperpermeability by attenuating the derangement of morphological and immune aspects of the intestinal , suggesting that MvfR function is crucial in the deterioration of intestinal  following P. aeruginosa burn‑site infection. Therefore, an anti‑virulence approach targeting MvfR, could potentially offer a novel therapeutic approach against multi‑drug resistant P. aeruginosa infections following thermal injuries. Since this approach is targeting virulence pathways that are non‑essential for growth or viability, our strategy is hypothesized to minimize the development of bacterial resistance, and preserve the beneficial enteric microbes, while improving intestinal  that is deranged as a result of burn and infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31074319>Human umbilical cord blood cells restore vascular  in injured rat brain and modulate inflammation .</a></h1><p> Traumatic brain injury is a complex condition consisting of a mechanical injury with neurovascular disruption and inflammation with limited clinical interventions available.

We observed that cells delivered 72 h postinjury significantly restored blood-brain  . HUCB cells reduced the amount of TNF-α and IFN-γ released by activated primary rat splenocytes, which correlated with the expression of COX2 and IDO1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30837039>[Effect of Aging on Experimental Colitis in Mice and Its Associated Mechanism].</a></h1><p>Objective To explore whether aging increases severity of colitis in mice and its mechanism.Methods Young (6-8 weeks)and aged (56 weeks) C57Bl/6 mice were divided into the control and experimental group (n=,each). Dextran sodium sulfate(DSS) was used to induce acute colitis mouse model in the experimental group.The mRNA expressions of tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α)and interleukin-6(IL-6)in colon were measured by RT-PCR. Tight junctions (TJs) of intestinal epithelial cells was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Protein expressions of E-cadherin and occludin were detected by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry in colon.Results Compared with the young DSS-induced mice,the aged DSS-induced mice had more weight loss(t=3.679,P=0.006),higher disease indexes (t=2.496,P=0.037),higher histologic scores(U=0.000,P=0.008) and higher colonic IL-6 level (U=4.000,P=0.191). The TJs of intestinal epithelial cells were discontinuous in old healthy rats,and the TJs were destroyed significantly in both young and aged DSS-induced mice. Compared with the young DSS-induced mice,the aged DSS-induced mice had decreased protein expressions of E-cadherin (t=0.184,P=0.863)and occludin (t=0.399,P=0.710).Conclusions Aging leads to more severe disease following DSS challenge. Age-related deterioration in the functions of the gastrointestinal  and  may be one of the possible mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30789669>Dietary leonurine hydrochloride supplementation attenuates lipopolysaccharide challenge-induced intestinal inflammation and  dysfunction by inhibiting the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway in broilers.</a></h1><p>This study was performed to evaluate the beneficial effects of dietary leonurine hydrochloride (LH) supplementation on intestinal morphology and   and further illuminate its underlying antioxidant and immunomodulatory mechanisms in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated broilers. A total of 120 1-d-old male broilers (Ross 308) were assigned to 4 treatment groups with 6 replicates of  birds per cage. The experiment was designed in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with LH (0 or 120 mg/kg) and LPS (injection of saline or 1. mg/kg body weight) as treatments. On days 14, 16, 18, and 20 of the trial, broilers were intraperitoneally injected with LPS or physiological saline. Compared with the control group, LPS-challenged broilers showed impaired growth performance (P < 0.05) from day 15 to day 21 of the trial, increased serum diamine oxidase (DAO) and D-lactic acid (D-LA) levels coupled with reduced glutathione (GSH) content and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity (duodenal and jejunal mucosa), reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content (duodenal, jejunal, and ileal mucosa), and compromised morphological structure of the duodenum and jejunum. Additionally, LPS challenge increased (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes and reduced tight junction (TJ) protein expression in the jejunum. However, dietary LH prevented LPS-induced reductions in average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) in broilers. It also alleviated LPS challenge-induced increases in serum DAO levels, MDA content (duodenal and jejunal mucosa), and jejunal crypt depth (P < 0.05) but reduced villus height, GSH content (jejunal mucosa), and T-SOD activity (duodenal and jejunal mucosa) (P < 0.05). Additionally, LH supplementation significantly downregulated the mRNA expression of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and upregulated the mRNA expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and Occludin in the jejunal mucosa induced by LPS (P < 0.05). On the other hand, LH administration prevented LPS-induced activation of the p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and attenuated IkB alpha (IκBα) phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB (p65) in the jejunal mucosa. In conclusion, dietary LH supplementation attenuates intestinal mucosal disruption mainly by accelerating the expression of TJ proteins and inhibiting activation of the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway.© The Author(s) 2019.

To test this,  disruption was induced in polarized Caco-2 monolayers by sequential, basolateral treatment with IFN-γ and TNF-α. Apical application of either 25% v/v reconstituted skim milk (RSM) or ultra high temperature (UHT) milk (2% fat) prior to cytokine exposure reduced losses to transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). Permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FD-4; 4 kDa) was also significantly reduced in the presence of 25% v/v UHT milk ( P < 0.05) but not RSM. Protection against increases in paracellular permeability was even greater when cell-free preparations of L. casei BL23 fermented UHT milk or fermented RSM were applied. The permeability coefficients of cells incubated with BL23 fermented UHT milk were equivalent to the untreated controls ( P = 0.12) and those cells also produced 247.6 ± 35. pg/mL IL-8, quantities significantly lower than found for cytokine-treated controls (353.9 ± 40.0 pg/mL). The benefits of the fermented milk were also confirmed by the reduced expression of TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2), myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), and claudin-encoding genes relative to the controls. By comparison, apical application of viable L. casei onto the Caco-2 cells did not result in protection from the -disruptive actions of IFN-γ and TNF-α. These results indicate that milk can maintain intestinal   during pro-inflammatory cytokine exposure and that this is enhanced by modifications to milk matrix caused by prior incubation with L. casei BL23.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384532>Aspirin alleviates endothelial gap junction dysfunction through inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in LPS-induced vascular injury.</a></h1><p>The loss of endothelial connective  and endothelial  dysfunction can lead to increased vascular injury, which is related to the activation of endothelial inflammasomes. There are evidences that low concentrations of aspirin can effectively prevent cardiovascular diseases. We hypothesized that low-dose aspirin could ameliorate endothelial injury by inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and ultimately prevent cardiovascular diseases. Microvascular endothelial cells were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (2 μg/mL) and administrated by 0.1-2 mmol/L aspirin. The wild type mice were stimulated with LPS (100 μg/kg/day), and 1 h later treated with aspirin (12., 62., or 125 mg/kg/day) and dexamethasone (0.0182 mg/kg/day) for 7 days. Plasma and heart were harvested for measurement of ELISA and immunofluorescence analyses. We found that aspirin could inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation  in dose-dependent manner and has correlation between the NLRP3 inflammasome and the ROS/TXNIP pathway. We also found that low-concentration aspirin could inhibit the formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and restore the expression of the endothelial tight junction protein zonula occludens-1/2 (ZO1/2). We assume that aspirin can ameliorate the endothelial layer dysfunction by suppressing the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31248104>Impact of Maternal Malnutrition on Gut  Defense: Implications for Pregnancy Health and Fetal Development.</a></h1><p>Small intestinal Paneth cells, enteric glial cells (EGC), and goblet cells maintain gut mucosal , homeostasis, and influence host physiology locally and through the gut-brain axis. Little is known about their roles during pregnancy, or how maternal malnutrition impacts these cells and their development. Pregnant mice were fed a control diet (CON), undernourished by 30% vs. control (UN), or fed a high fat diet (HF). At day 18. (term = 19), gut  and function were assessed by immunohistochemistry and qPCR. UN mothers displayed reduced mRNA expression of Paneth cell antimicrobial peptides (AMP; ) and an accumulation of villi goblet cells, while HF had reduced  and mucin () mRNA and increased lysozyme protein. UN fetuses had increased mRNA expression of gut transcription factor , associated with reduced expression of maturation markers (, ), and increased expression of tight junctions (TJ; ). HF fetuses had increased mRNA expression of EGC markers (, , ), AMP (, , ), and TJ (, ), and reduced expression of an AMP-activator (). Maternal malnutrition altered expression of genes that maintain maternal gut homeostasis, and altered fetal gut permeability, function, and development. This may have long-term implications for host-microbe interactions, immunity, and offspring gut-brain axis function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068126>In vitro characterization of odorranalectin for peptide-based drug delivery across the blood-brain .</a></h1><p>The use of siRNA-based gene silencing has been recently underscored as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neurological disorders. However, the stability of siRNA and other small molecule therapeutics is challenged by their intrinsic instability and limited passage across the blood-brain  (BBB). Based on these premises, our objective was to characterize/optimize odorranalectin (OL), a small non-immunogenic lectin-like peptide, as a carrier for targeted delivery across the BBB. For this purpose, (6)-carboxyfluorescein-conjugated OL and scramble peptide were synthesized, and then their BBB cellular internalization/trafficking and stability were characterized versus temperature, pH and serum content in the media in hCMEC/D3 cells as a model of BBB endothelium. Specifically,  of the internalized peptide in cell lysates was analyzed by LC/MS while cellular distribution and intracellular trafficking of OL was examined by fluorescence microscopy with early-late endosome (pHRodo Red) and lysosome (Lysotracker) markers.Our data show that cellular uptake of OL increased linearly with the concentrations tested in this study at 37 °C and the uptake was two to threefolds higher when compared to scramble peptide. While there were no differences for scramble peptide, the uptake of OL decreased by 50% at 4 °C incubation (vs. 37 °C). No effects of pH were observed on endothelial uptake of OL. Immunofluorescence studies also indicated a significant cellular internalization of OL that remained intact (as evaluated by LC-MS/MS) and co-localized with endosomal, but not lysosome marker. Importantly, OL was found non-toxic to cells at all concentrations tested.In summary, our data suggest the existence of a receptor-mediated transcytosis pathway for cellular uptake of OL at the BBB endothelium. However, in vivo studies will be needed to assess the siRNA loading capacity of OL and its trans-BBB transport efficiency for targeted delivery in the brain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995271>Calcium-induced differentiation in normal human colonoid cultures: Cell-cell / cell-matrix adhesion,  formation and tissue .</a></h1><p>The goal of the study was to assess calcium alone and Aquamin, a multi-mineral natural product that contains magnesium and detectable levels of 72 trace elements in addition to calcium, for capacity to affect growth and differentiation in colonoid cultures derived from histologically-normal human colon tissue.Colonoid cultures were maintained in a low-calcium (0.25 mM) medium or in medium supplemented with an amount of calcium (1.-3.0 mM), either from calcium alone or Aquamin for a period of two weeks. This was shown in a previous study to induce differentiation in colonoids derived from large adenomas. Changes in growth, morphological features and protein expression profile were assessed at the end of the incubation period using a combination of phase-contrast and scanning electron microscopy, histology and immunohistology, proteomic assessment and transmission electron microscopy.Unlike the previously-studied tumor-derived colonoids (which remained un-differentiated in the absence of calcium-supplementation), normal tissue colonoids underwent differentiation as indicated by gross and microscopic appearance, a low proliferative index and high-level expression of cytokeratin 20 in the absence of intervention (i.e., in control condition). Only modest additional changes were seen in these parameters with either calcium alone or Aquamin (providing up to 3.0 mM calcium). In spite of this, proteomic analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed that both interventions induced strong up-regulation of proteins that promote cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesive functions,  formation and tissue . Transmission electron microscopy revealed an increase in desmosomes in response to intervention.These findings demonstrate that colonoids derived from histologically normal human tissue can undergo differentiation in the presence of a low ambient calcium concentration. However, higher calcium levels induce elaboration of proteins that promote cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. These changes could lead to improved  function and improved colon tissue health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31091226>Thrombin-cleaved syndecan-3/-4 ectodomain fragments mediate endothelial  dysfunction.</a></h1><p>The endothelial glycocalyx constitutes part of the endothelial  but its degradation leaves endothelial cells exposed to transmigrating cells and circulating mediators that can damage the  or promote intercellular gaps. Syndecan proteins are key components of the endothelial glycocalyx and are shed during disease states where expression and activity of proteases such as thrombin are elevated. We tested the ability of thrombin to cleave the ectodomains of syndecans and whether the products could act directly on endothelial cells to alter  function.Using transmission electron microscopy, we illustrated the presence of glycocalyx in human lung microvasculature. We confirmed expression of all syndecan subtypes on the endothelial surface of agarose-inflated human lungs. ELISA and western blot analysis suggested that thrombin can cleave syndecan-3/-4 ectodomains to produce fragments. In vivo, syndecan-3 ectodomain fragments increased extravasation of albumin-bound Evans blue in mouse lung, indicative of plasma protein leakage into the surrounding tissue. Syndecan-3/-4 ectodomain fragments decreased transendothelial electrical resistance, a measure of cell-cell adhesive  , in a manner sensitive to a Rho kinase inhibitor. These effects were independent of glycosylation and thrombin receptor PAR1. Moreover, these cleavage products caused rapid VE-cadherin-based adherens junction disorganization and increased F-actin stress fibers, supporting their direct effect on endothelial paracellular permeability.We suggest that thrombin can cleave syndecan-3/4 ectodomain into fragments which interact with endothelial cells causing paracellular hyperpermeability. This may have important implications in the pathogenesis of vascular dysfunction during sepsis or thrombotic disease states where thrombin is activated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31379246>Opioid use potentiates the virulence of hospital-acquired infection, increases systemic bacterial dissemination and exacerbates gut dysbiosis in a murine model of  infection.</a></h1><p>Opioid analgesics are frequently prescribed in the United States and worldwide. However, serious side effects such as addiction, immunosuppression and gastrointestinal symptoms limit their use. It was recently demonstrated that morphine treatment results in a significant disruption in gut  function, leading to an increased translocation of gut commensal bacteria. Further studies have indicated distinct alterations in the gut microbiome and metabolome following morphine treatment, contributing to the negative consequences that are associated with opioid use. However, it is unclear how opioids modulate gut homeostasis in the context of a hospital-acquired bacterial infection.  is an ideal murine model of human infections with enteropathogenic  (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC). In the current study, a mouse model of  infection was used to investigate the role of morphine in the modulation of gut homeostasis in the context of a hospital-acquired bacterial infection. Morphine treatment resulted in 1) the promotion of  systemic dissemination, 2) an increase in the expression of the virulence factors of  colonization in intestinal contents, 3) altered gut microbiome, 4) damaged  of gut epithelial  function, ) inhibition of the -induced increase in goblet cells, and 6) dysregulated IL-17A immune response. This study demonstrates and further validates a positive correlation between opioid drug use/abuse and an increased risk of infections, suggesting that the overprescription of opioids may increase the susceptibility to hospital-acquired infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620112>Selective Disruption of the Blood-Brain  by Zika Virus.</a></h1><p>The blood-brain  (BBB) selectively regulates the cellular exchange of macromolecules between the circulation and the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we hypothesize that Zika virus (ZIKV) infects the brain via a disrupted BBB and altered expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins, which are structural components of the BBB. To assess this hypothesis,  and  studies were performed using three different strains of ZIKV: Honduras (ZIKV-H), Puerto Rico (ZIKV-PR), and Uganda (ZIKV-U). Primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) were productively infected by all studied ZIKV strains at MOI 0.01, and were analyzed by plaque assay, immunofluorescence for NS1 protein, and qRT-PCR at 2 and 6 days post-infection (dpi). Compared to mock-infected controls, expression level of ZO-1 was significantly upregulated in ZIKV-H-infected BMECs, while occludin and claudin- levels were significantly downregulated in BMECs infected by all three studied viral strains. Interestingly, BMEC permeability was not disturbed by ZIKV infection, even in the presence of a very high viral load (MOI 10). All studied ZIKV strains productively infected wild-type C57BL/J mice after intravenous infection with 10 PFU. Viral load was detected in the plasma, spleen, and brain from 1 to 8 dpi. Peak brain infection was observed at 2 dpi; therefore, TJ protein expression was assessed at this time point. Claudin- was significantly downregulated in ZIKV-U-infected animals and the BBB  was significantly disturbed in ZIKV-H-infected animals. Our results suggest that ZIKV penetrates the brain parenchyma early after infection with concurrent alterations of TJ protein expression and disruption of the BBB permeability in a strain-dependent manner.Copyright © 2019 Leda, Bertrand, Andras, El-Hage, Nair and Toborek.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31325706>Qingjie Fuzheng Granule attenuates -fluorouracil-induced intestinal mucosal damage.</a></h1><p>-Fluorouracil (-FU)-based chemotherapy often causes several drawbacks including weight loss, diarrhea, myelosuppression, and the intestinal mucositis. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of Qingjie Fuzheng Granule (QFG) on -FU-induced intestinal mucositis in CT-26 tumor-bearing xenograft mice and investigated the possible molecular mechanism.Tumor xenograft models of CT-26 cells were generated in BALB/c nude mice, the mice were randomly divided into 4 groups including control, QFG, -FU and -FU combined QFG groups. The body weight, volume of tumor and diarrhea score of each group were recorded daily. On the fifth day, the blood of mice was collected, the mice were subsequently euthanized and their thymus, spleen, intestine and tumor were removed for the following analysis.QFG alleviated severe diarrhea and reversed the decrease in the number of white blood cell including granulocyte and lymphocyte induced by -FU. QFG could also significantly improve -FU-induced several intestinal mucosal damages, and characterized by integrity villus and crypts, the reduction of necrotic cells. QFG decreased the serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and increased the levels of IL-10. Furthermore, QFG inhibited the cellular apoptosis in the jejunum tissue caused by -FU via the increasing Bcl-2 expression and decreasing Bax expression. In addition, QFG promoted the cell proliferation via elevating the expression of Cyclin D1 and CDK4 and reducing p21 expression. Meanwhile, QFG could not further impact on the cell apoptosis and proliferation of tumors caused by -FU.QFG attenuated the intestinal mucositis and diarrhea induced by -FU via preventive effect on inflammation and its improvement of the intestinal  , inhibiting cell apoptosis and promoting cell proliferation, and without affecting the -FU treatment efficiency. The results suggest that QFG may act as a potential agent against chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

The leakage of BBB contributes to the infiltration of peripheral immune cells and harmful mediators into brain parenchyma, even the drugs that can not cross BBB under physiological conditions. Therefore, PD has been regarded as not only a neurodegenerative disease, but also a systemic disorder. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that Dexrazoxane (Dex), a drug clinically used to reduce doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in chemotherapy, can enter into midbrain and striatum through broken BBB in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)- and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced rodent models of PD. Unexpectedly, Dex (1., , 15 mg/kg, i.p.) administration for 3-week significantly ameliorates apomorphine-induced contralateral rotation behavior in 6-OHDA-treated rats and Dex (10 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment for -week improves MPTP-induced mouse motor dysfunctions. We find that Dex administration protects dopaminergic neurons against neurotoxin-induced degeneration in SNc, accompanied by the attenuated glial cell activation. Further study indicates that suppression of oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, as well as the inhibition of systemic inflammation in both peripheral tissues and brain, contribute to the neuroprotective effects of Dex in PD models. Our study implies that Dex may serve as an effective neuroprotectant to treat neurodegeneration and has potential clinical value in term of PD therapeutics.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Of interest, an adherence to a Mediterranean diet has been linked to a reduction in mortality and morbidity in patients with inflammatory diseases. Diet and intestinal microbiota are modifying factors that may influence intestinal  strength, functional , and permeability regulation. Intestinal microbiota may play a crucial role in RA pathogenesis, but up to now no solid data has clarified a mechanistic relationship between gut microbiota and the development of RA. Nonetheless, microbiota composition in subjects with RA differs from that of controls and this altered microbiome can be partially restored after prescribing disease modifying antirheumatic drugs. High levels of  and similar species are correlated with low levels of microbiota previously associated with immune regulating properties. In addition, some nutrients can alter intestinal permeability and thereby influence the immune response without a known impact on the microbiota. However, critical questions remain to be elucidated, such as the way microbiome fluctuates in relation to diet, and how disease activity may be influenced by changes in diet, microbiota or diet-intestinal microbiota equilibrium.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048585>Seizures Are Associated with Blood-Brain  Disruption in a Piglet Model of Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischaemic Encephalopathy.</a></h1><p>Seizures in the neonatal period are most often symptomatic of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction and the most common cause is hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE). Seizures are associated with poor long-term outcomes and increased neuropathology. Blood-brain  (BBB) disruption and inflammation may contribute to seizures and increased neuropathology but are incompletely understood in neonatal HIE. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of seizures on BBB  in a preclinical model of neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic (HI) injury. Piglets (age: <24 h) were subjected to a 30-min HI insult followed by recovery to 72 h post-insult. Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) was performed and seizure burden and background aEEG pattern were analysed. BBB disruption was evaluated in the parietal cortex and hippocampus by means of immunohistochemistry and Western blot. mRNA and protein expression of tight-junction proteins (zonula-occludens 1 [ZO1], occludin [OCLN], and claudin- [CLDN5]) was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot. In addition, mRNA from genes associated with BBB disruption vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) as well as inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was assessed with qPCR. Piglets that developed seizures following HI (HI-Sz) had significantly greater injury, as demonstrated by poorer aEEG background pattern scores, lower neurobehavioural scores, and greater histopathology. HI-Sz animals had severe IgG extravasation into brain tissue and uptake into neurons as well as significantly greater levels of IgG in both brain regions as assessed by Western blot. IgG protein in both brain regions was significantly associated with seizure burden, aEEG pattern scores, and neurobehavioural scores. There was no difference in mRNA expression of the tight junctions, however a significant loss of ZO1 and OCLN protein was observed in the parietal cortex. The inflammatory genes TGFβ, IL1β, IL8, IL6, and TNFα were significantly upregulated in HI-Sz animals. MMP2 was significantly increased in animals with seizures compared with animals without seizures. Increasing our understanding of neuropathology associated with seizure is vital because of the association between seizure and poor outcomes.

Over time, normal skin aging is accelerated by external stresses such as smoking, pollution, chemical products and radiation. UV light, in particular UVA, causes DNA damage, apoptosis and morphological modifications, which are responsible for both premature aging and cancer. The aim of this study was to establish a discriminatory and sufficiently reproducible cutaneous model for evaluating UVA damage, to enable testing for effectiveness of potentially protective compounds.The cutaneous model is based on Human skin explants irradiated with UVA. Deleterious effects on epidermis were observed and quantified by haematoxylin-eosin staining and by immunofluorescence of ɣ-H2Ax, cytokeratin , involucrin and loricrin protein. Dermis deterioration was evaluated by transmission electronic microscopy and zymography in situ.We were able to observe and quantify deleterious effects associated with UVA irradiation: epidermal and dermal disruption, appearance of Sunburn cells, increased DNA damage and induced apoptosis. The use of this model in the evaluation of protective compounds was first confirmed using sunscreens, then further validated with a panel of active ingredients which showed beneficial effects on epidermis morphology and DNA  after UVA exposure.We have developed a model and a standardised protocol, based on the use of human skin explants, which allows us to explore the protective effect of active ingredients to environmental stresses such as UVA.This article is protected by copyright.

Seeking the initiating events, we tested the hypothesis that the intestine could be damaged by repeated lipid supply and therefore participate in inflammation. In mice, 1- palm oil gavages increased intestinal permeability via decreased expression and mislocalization of junctional proteins at the cell-cell contacts; altered the intestinal bacterial species by decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, segmented filamentous bacteria, and Clostridium leptum; and increased inflammatory cytokine expression. This was further studied in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2/TC7 cells using the two main components of palm oil, i.e., palmitic and oleic acid. Saturated palmitic acid impaired paracellular permeability and junctional protein localization, and induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the cells, but unsaturated oleic acid did not. Inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis prevented part of these effects. Altogether, our data show that short exposure to palm oil or palmitic acid induces intestinal dysfunctions targeting   and inflammation. Excessive palm oil consumption could be an early player in the gut alterations observed in metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Paracellular permeability is governed by intercellular tight-junctions (TJs). Zonulin is, to date, the only known physiological regulator of intestinal TJs. We used a zonulin transgenic mouse (Ztm) model characterized by increased small intestinal permeability to elucidate the role of a primary impaired gut  on microbiome composition and/or immune profile. Ztm exhibit an altered gene expression profile of TJs in the gut compared to wild-type mice (WT): Claudin-15, Claudin-, Jam-3, and Myosin-1C are decreased in the male duodenum whereas Claudin-15, Claudin-7, and ZO-2 are reduced in the female colon. These results are compatible with loss of gut  function and are paralleled by an altered microbiota composition with reduced abundance of the genus , known to have positive effects on gut   and strengthening, and an increased abundance of the  genus, associated to low-grade inflammatory conditions. Immune profile analysis shows a subtly skewed distribution of immune cell subsets toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype with more IL-17 producing adaptive and innate-like T cells in Ztm. Interestingly, microbiota "normalization" involving the transfer of WT microbiota into Ztm, did not rescue the altered immune profile. Our data suggest that a primary impaired gut  causing an uncontrolled trafficking of microbial products leads to a latent pro-inflammatory status, with a skewed microbiota composition and immune profile that, in the presence of an environmental trigger, as we have previously described (1), might promote the onset of overt inflammation and an increased risk of chronic disease.Copyright © 2019 Miranda-Ribera, Ennamorati, Serena, Cetinbas, Lan, Sadreyev, Jain, Fasano and Fiorentino.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846360>Slit2/Robo4 signaling pathway modulates endothelial hyper-permeability in a two-event in vitro model of transfusion-related acute lung injury.</a></h1><p>Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) remains the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality.

However, not much is known about the role of Slit2/Robo4 signaling pathway in the pathophysiology of TRALI. In this study, the TRALI model was performed by the "two-event" model of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN)-mediated pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) damage. We investigated the expression of Slit2/Robo4 and VE-cadherin and examined the pulmonary endothelial hyper-permeability in TRALI model. We found that the expression of Slit2/Robo4 and VE-cadherin were significantly decreased in a time-dependent manner, whereas the PMVECs permeability was gradually increased over time in TRALI model. Moreover, the treatment with Slit2-N, an active fragment of Slit2, increased the expression of Slit2/Robo4 and VE-cadherin to protect PMVECs from PMN-mediated pulmonary endothelial hyper-permeability. These results indicate that targeting Slit2/Robo4 signaling pathway may modulate the permeability as well as protect the  of endothelial . In addition, Slit2-N appears to be a promising candidate for developing novel therapies against TRALI.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to investigate if rutin hydrate (RH), a well-reported neuroprotective and an antioxidant flavonoid, can ameliorate cadmium chloride (CdCl2)-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting the resultant ER stress. Rats were divided into 4 groups (n = 16/group) of control, control + RH (100 mg/kg), CdCl ( mg/kg), and CdCl + RH. All treatments were administered orally for 30 days, on daily basis. Brain homogenates from CdCl-treated rats showed increased oxidative stress and induced activation of ER stress characterized by increasing mRNA and protein levels of GRP78, ATF-6, CHOP and Xbp-1 and protein levels of p-elF2α, p-JNK1/2 and cleaved caspase-12. Also, CdCl significantly reduced Bcl-2, enhanced Bax translocation to the mitochondrial membrane, increased cytoplasmic levels of cytochrome-C and caspase-3, and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) (increased Vmax and reduced time to Vmax). In contrast, RH significantly enhanced levels GSH and activities of SOD, GSH-Px, decreased levels of MDA and inhibited mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mtPTP) in the brains of both control and CdCl-treated rats. Interestingly, in brain homogenates of CdCl-treated rats only, RH reduced all markers of ER stress, increased Bcl-2, reduced mitochondrial Bax translocation and improved mitochondrial coupling. It also reduced cytosolic levels of cytochrome-C, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-12. Overall, these findings support the efficiency of RH to inhibit ER stress in brains CdCl2-treated rats which is added to its existing mechanisms of neuroprotection. : ATF-6: activating transcription factor-6; Bax: Bcl-associated x; BBB: blood-brain ; Bcl-2: B-cell lymphoma 2; BiP: immunoglobulin heavy-chain-binding protein; [Ca]i: intracellular free Ca concentration; Cd: cadmium; CdCl: cadmium chloride; CHOP: CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein; CMC: carboxymethyl cellulose; Δψm: mitochondrial membrane potential; elF2α: phospho-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD: ER-associated protein degradation; ERK1/2: extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2; GADD 153: growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 153; GRP78, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein; GSH: reduced glutathione; GSH: reduced glutathione; GSH-Px: glutathione peroxidase; GSSG: glutathione disulfide (oxidized glutathione); IRE-1: inositol-requiring enzyme-1; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; MDA: malondialdehyde; mTOR: Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin; mtPTP: mitochondrial permeability transition pore; ONOO: peroxynitrite; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; PERK: protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase; p-JNK: phospho-JNK; qPCR: quantitative PCR; RCR: respiratory control ratio; RH: rutin hydrate; RHoGDI: Rho-GDP-dissociation inhibitor; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SOD: superoxide dismutase; UPR: unfolded protein response; VDAC: voltage-dependent anion channel; Vmax: maximal rate of pore opening; Xbp-1: X-box binding protein 1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31475432>White matter  and functional predictors of response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for posttraumatic stress disorder and major depression.</a></h1><p>Recent evidence suggests that therapeutic repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an effective treatment for pharmacoresistant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD). We recently demonstrated that response to  Hz TMS administered to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was predicted by functional connectivity of the medial prefrontal (MPFC) and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). This functionally-defined circuit is a novel target for treatment optimization research, however, our limited knowledge of the structural pathways that underlie this functional predisposition is a  to target engagement research.To investigate underlying structural elements of our previous functional connectivity findings, we submitted pre-TMS diffusion-weighted imaging data from 20 patients with PTSD and MDD to anatomically constrained tract-based probabilistic tractography (FreeSurfer's TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy). Averaged pathway fractional anisotropy (FA) was extracted from four frontal white matter tracts: the forceps minor, cingulum, anterior thalamic radiations (ATRs), and uncinate fasciculi. Tract FA statistics were treated as explanatory variables in backward regressions testing the relationship between tract  and functional connectivity coefficients from MPFC and sgACC predictors of symptom improvement after TMS.FA in the ATRs was consistently associated with symptom improvement in PTSD and MDD (Bonferroni-corrected p < .05).We found that structural characteristics of the ATR account for significant variance in individual-level functional predictors of post-TMS improvement. TMS optimization studies should target this circuit either in stand-alone or successive TMS stimulation protocols.© Published 2019.

Recent studies have shown that PM2. can also cause central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Activation of microglia in the central nervous system can lead to inflammatory and neurological damage. PM2. will reduce the methylation level of DNA and affect epigenetics. PM2. enters the human body through a variety of pathways to have pathological effects on CNS. For example, PM2. can destroy the  of the blood-brain  (BBB), so peripheral systemic inflammation easily crosses BBB and reaches CNS. The olfactory nerve is another way for PM2. particles to enter the brain. Surprisingly, PM2. can also enter the gastrointestinal tract, causing imbalances in the intestinal microecology to affect central nervous system diseases. The current work collected and discuss the mechanisms of PM2.-induced CNS damage and PM2.-induced neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Greater understanding is required of the underlying relationships in ischemic brains in order to prevent stroke or to develop effective treatment. This review highlights new findings about the relationship of blood-brain  with astrocytes, pentraxin-3 (PTX3), and other factors expressed during or after ischemic stroke. These are discussed with respect to their ameliorative or deleterious effects. These effects are measured  in animal models as well as  in cell cultures. Evidence was found to suggest that astrocytes play a key role in stroke by expressing PTX3, which, in turn, enhances endothelial tightness, increases tight junction proteins, and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor. The role of astrocytes and PTX3 is examined in relation to hypoxic stress and conditioning as well as mitochondrial transfer. Astrocytes and PTX3 are placed in the context of brain circulation and related areas.Copyright: © 2019 Brain Circulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30654793>Improvement of diabetic wound healing by topical application of Vicenin-2 hydrocolloid film on Sprague Dawley rats.</a></h1><p>Impaired wound healing is a debilitating complication of diabetes that leads to significant morbidity, particularly foot ulcers. The risk of developing diabetic foot ulcers for diabetic patients is 15% over their lifetime and approximately 85% of limb amputations is caused by non-healing ulcers. Unhealed, gangrenous wounds destroy the structural  of the skin, which acts as a protective  that prevents the invasion of external noxious agents into the body. Vicenin-2 (VCN-2) has been reported to contain prospective anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that enhance cell proliferation and migration. Sodium Alginate (SA) is a natural polysaccharide that possesses gel forming properties and has biodegradable and biocompatible characteristics. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of SA wound dressings containing VCN-2 on diabetic wounds.Wounds were inflicted in type-1 diabetic-streptozotocin (STZ) induced male Sprague Dawley rats. Subsequently, relevant groups were topically treated with the indicated concentrations (12., 25 and 50 μM) of VCN-2 hydrocolloid film over the study duration (14 days). The control group was treated with vehicle dressing (blank or allantoin). Wounded tissues and blood serum were collected on 0, 7 and 14 days prior to sacrifice. Appropriate wound assessments such as histological tests, nitric oxide assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and immunoblotting assays were conducted to confirm wound healing efficacy in the in vivo model. One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used for statistical analysis.Results showed that hydrocolloid film was recapitulated with VCN-2 enhanced diabetic wound healing in a dose-dependent manner. VCN-2 reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α), mediators (iNOS and COX-2), and nitric oxide (NO) via the NF-κB pathway. Data suggests that the VCN-2 film facilitated healing in hyperglycemic conditions by releasing growth factors such as (VEGF and TGF-β) to enhance cell proliferation, migration, and wound contraction via the VEGF and TGF-β mechanism pathways.This study's findings suggest that VCN-2 may possess wound healing potential since topical treatment with VCN-2 hydrocolloid films effectively enhanced wound healing in hyperglycemic conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30628466>Conducting clinical trials-costs, impacts, and the value of clinical trials networks: A scoping review.</a></h1><p>A significant  to conducting clinical trials is their high cost, which is driven primarily by the time and resources required to activate trials and reach accrual targets. The high cost of running trials has a substantial impact on their long-term feasibility and the type of clinical research undertaken.A scoping review of the empirical literature on the costs associated with conducting clinical trials was undertaken for the years 2001-2015. Five reference databases were consulted to elicit how trials costs are presented in the literature. A review instrument was developed to extract the content of in-scope papers. Findings were characterized by date and place of publication, clinical disease area, and network/cooperative group designation, when specified. Costs were captured and grouped by patient accrual and management, infrastructure, and the opportunity costs associated with industry funding for trials research. Cost impacts on translational research and health systems were also captured, as were recommendations to reduce trial expenditures. Since articles often cited multiple costs, multiple cost coding was used during data extraction to capture the range and frequency of costs.A total of 288 empirical articles were included. The distribution of reported costs was: patient management and accrual costs (132 articles), infrastructure costs (118 articles) and the opportunity costs of industry sponsorship (72 articles). 221 articles reported on the impact of undertaking costly trials on translational research and health systems; of these, the most frequently reported consequences were to research  (52% of articles), research capacity (36% of articles) and running low-value trials (34% of articles). 254 articles provided recommendations to reduce trial costs; of these, the most frequently reported recommendations related to improvements in: operational efficiencies (33% of articles); patient accrual (24% of articles); funding for trials and transparency in trials reporting (18% of articles, each).Key findings from the review are: 1) delayed trial activation has costs to budgets and research; 2) poor accrual leads to low-value trials and wasted resources; 3) the pharmaceutical industry can be a pragmatic, if problematic, partner in clinical research; 4) organizational know-how and successful research collaboration are benefits of network/cooperative groups; and ) there are spillover benefits of clinical trials to healthcare systems, including better health outcomes, enhanced research capacity, and drug cost avoidance. There is a need for more economic evaluations of the benefits of clinical research, such as health system use (or avoidance) and health outcomes in cities and health authorities with institutions that conduct clinical research, to demonstrate the affordability of clinical trials, despite their high cost.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946611> inhibits oncostatin M and maintains tight junction  in a murine model of acute experimental colitis.</a></h1><p> Levels of oncostatin M (OSM) and the composition of gut microbiota predict responses to anti-TNF agents used for IBD therapy. Here, the aim was to investigate the effects of , a gut microbiota, on OSM and on intestinal  in colitis.  In the murine model of 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, we tested disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histological score and expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins (ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1), OSM, TNF-α and TLR5. In addition, a cellular model was used to examine the role of  during secretion of OSM by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) isolated from wild-type (WT) and TLR5 knockout (TLR5 KO) mice. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of OSM on expressions of TJ proteins by Caco-2 cells.   in DSS-induced colitis decreased DAI score ( < .001), colon length shortening (6.46 ± 0.36 cm  .65 ± 0.47 cm,  = .022), histological score (2.667 ± 1.15  .33 ± 1.14,  = .018) and increased expression of TJ proteins ( < .05). In addition,  reduced expression of OSM ( < .05) and TNF-α ( < .05), while increasing expression of TLR5 ( < .05). Furthermore,  reduced secretion of OSM ( < .05) by LPS-induced BMDMs isolated from WT and TLR5 KO mice. Moreover, OSM downregulated expression of TJ proteins ( < .05) by Caco-2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner.  These results indicate that  attenuates inflammation in IBD by decreasing secretion of OSM and by promoting intestinal  function. Taken together, the data provide insight into the role of the gut microbiota in patients with IBD who are resistant to anti-TNF therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31446614>The effect of propofol on hypoxia-modulated expression of heat shock proteins: potential mechanism in modulating blood-brain  permeability.</a></h1><p>Heat shock proteins (HSPs) may be induced by hypoxia and alleviate blood-brain  (BBB) damage. The neuroprotective effect of propofol has been reported. We aimed to identify whether propofol induced HSPs expression and protected BBB . Mouse astrocytes and microglia cells were cultured and exposed to hypoxia and propofol. The expression of HSP27, HSP32, HSP70, and HSP90, and the translocation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and Nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were investigated. Mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells, astrocytes, and microglial cells were co-cultured to establish in vitro BBB model, and the effects of hypoxia and propofol as well as HSPs knockdown/overexpression on BBB  were measured. Hypoxia (% O, % CO, 90% humidity) treatment for 6 h and 12 h induced HSP27, HSP32, and HSP70 expression. Propofol (25 μΜ) increased HSP27 and HSP32 expression, starting with exposure to hypoxia for 3 h. Propofol induced HSF1 translocation from cytoplasmic to nuclear compartment, and blockade of HSF1 inhibited HSP27 expression in mouse astrocytes when they were exposed to hypoxia for 3 h. Propofol induced Nrf2 translocation, and blockade of Nrf2 inhibited HSP32 expression in mouse microglial cells when they were exposed to hypoxia for 3 h. Propofol protected hypoxia-impaired BBB , and the effects were abolished by blockade of HSF1 and Nrf2. Overexpression of HSP27 and HSP32 alleviated hypoxia-impaired BBB , and blockade of HSP27 and HSP32 expression ameliorated propofol-mediated protection against BBB impairment. Propofol may protect hypoxia-mediated BBB impairment. The mechanisms may involve HSF1-mediated HSP27 expression and Nrf2-mediated HSP32 expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30929229>Antimicrobial effect and proposed action mechanism of cordycepin against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.</a></h1><p>The detailed antibacterial mechanism of cordycepin efficacy against food-borne germs remains ambiguous. In this study, the antibacterial activity and action mechanism of cordycepin were assessed. The results showed that cordycepin effectively inhibited the growth of seven bacterial pathogens including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens; the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were 2. and 1.25 mg/ml against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, respectively. Scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope examination confirmed that cordycepin caused obvious damages in the cytoplasmatic membranes of both E. coli and B. subtilis. Outer membrane permeability assessment indicated the loss of  function and the leakage of cytoplasmic contents. Propidium iodide and carboxyfluorescein diacetate double staining approach coupled with flow cytometry analysis indicated that the  of cell membrane was severely damaged during a short time, while the intracellular enzyme system still remained active. This clearly suggested that membrane damage was one of the reasons for cordycepin efficacy against bacteria. Additionally, results from circular dichroism and fluorescence analysis indicated cordycepin could insert to genome DNA base and double strand, which disordered the structure of genomic DNA. Basis on these results, the mode of bactericidal action of cordycepin against E. coli and B. subtilis was found to be a dual mechanism, disrupting bacterial cell membranes and binding to bacterial genomic DNA to interfere in cellular functions, ultimately leading to cell death.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31073629>Modulation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor using LM11A-31 prevents diabetes-induced retinal vascular permeability in mice via inhibition of inflammation and the RhoA kinase pathway.</a></h1><p>Breakdown of the inner blood-retinal  (BRB) is an early event in the pathogenesis of diabetic macular oedema, that eventually leads to vision loss. We have previously shown that diabetes causes an imbalance of nerve growth factor (NGF) isoforms resulting in accumulation of its precursor proNGF and upregulation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75), with consequent increases in the activation of Ras homologue gene family, member A (RhoA). We also showed that genetic deletion of p75 in diabetes preserved the BRB and prevented inflammatory mediators in retinas. This study aims to examine the therapeutic potential of LM11A-31, a small-molecule p75 modulator and proNGF antagonist, in preventing diabetes-induced BRB breakdown. The study also examined the role of p75/RhoA downstream signalling in mediating cell permeability.Male C57BL/6 J mice were rendered diabetic using streptozotocin injection. After 2 weeks of diabetes, mice received oral gavage of LM11A-31 (50 mg kg day) or saline (NaCl 154 mmol/l) for an additional 4 weeks. BRB breakdown was assessed by extravasation of BSA-AlexaFluor-488. Direct effects of proNGF were examined in human retinal endothelial (HRE) cells in the presence or absence of LM11A-31 or the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632.Diabetes triggered BRB breakdown and caused significant increases in circulatory and retinal TNF-α and IL-1β levels. These effects coincided with significant decreases in retinal NGF and increases in vascular endothelial growth factor and proNGF expression, as well as activation of RhoA. Interventional modulation of p75 activity through treatment of mouse models of diabetes with LM11A-31 significantly mitigated proNGF accumulation and preserved BRB . In HRE cells, treatment with mutant proNGF (10 ng/ml) triggered increased cell permeability with marked reduction of expression of tight junction proteins, zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-, compared with control, independent of inflammatory mediators or cell death. Modulating p75 significantly inhibited proNGF-mediated RhoA activation, occludin phosphorylation (at serine 490) and cell permeability. ProNGF induced redistribution of ZO-1 in the cell wall and formation of F-actin stress fibres; these effects were mitigated by LM11A-31.Targeting p75 signalling using LM11A-31, an orally bioavailable receptor modulator, may offer an effective, safe and non-invasive therapeutic strategy for treating macular oedema, a major cause of blindness in diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642122>Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide may affect the endothelial  and IL-10 expression of apolipoprotein B100-pulsed dendritic cells.</a></h1><p>Atherogenesis is associated with chronic gut infections; however, the mechanisms are not clear. The aim of the study was to determine whether lipopolysaccharide of E. coli (E. coli LPS) may affect endothelial  and modify IL-10 expression in dendritic cells (DCs). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and monocyte-derived DCs were treated with E. coli LPS, apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100) and 7-ketocholesterol (7-kCH) - harmful oxidized form of cholesterol. The effect of E. coli LPS, 7-kCH and ApoB100 on the  functions of HUVECs in real-time cell electric impedance sensing system (RTCA-DP) was assessed. Furthermore, the effect of 7-kCH and ApoB100 on  functions of HUVECs co-cultured with DCs previously treated with LPS was analyzed. Both E. coli LPS and 7-kCH decreased  functions of HUVECs and reduced tight junction proteins mRNA expression, whereas ApoB100 increased endothelial . In DCs, ApoB100 and E. coli LPS decreased IL-10 mRNA expression. In HUVECs co-cultured with DCs treated with LPS and subsequently pulsed with ApoB100 or 7-kCH IL-10 mRNA expression was lower. E. coli LPS-exposed DCs diminished the protective effect of ApoB100 on endothelial  and led to the decrease of occludin mRNA expression. LPS potentially derived from gut microflora may destabilize endothelial  together with oxidized cholesterol and intensify the immunogenicity of ApoB100.© 2019 APMIS.

However, the precise neuroprotective mechanism of Shuxuetong injection remains poorly understood. Here, cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (bEnd.3) were incubated in glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 95% N/% CO for 6 hours, followed by high-glucose medium containing 95% O and % CO for 18 hours to establish an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion model. This in vitro cell model was administered Shuxuetong injection at 1/32, 1/64, and 1/128 concentrations (diluted 32-, 64-, and 128-times). Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to evaluate cell viability. A fluorescence method was used to measure lactate dehydrogenase, and a fluorescence microplate reader used to detect intracellular reactive oxygen species. A fluorescent probe was also used to measure mitochondrial superoxide production. A cell resistance meter was used to measure transepithelial resistance and examine  of monolayer cells. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran test was performed to examine blood-brain  permeability. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed to analyze mRNA expression levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Western blot assay was performed to analyze expression of caspase-3, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, occludin, vascular endothelial growth factor, cleaved caspase-3, B-cell lymphoma 2, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, nuclear factor-κB p65, I kappa B alpha, phosphorylated I kappa B alpha, I kappa B kinase, phosphorylated I kappa B kinase, claudin-, and zonula occludens-1. Our results show that Shuxuetong injection increases bEnd.3 cell viability and B-cell lymphoma 2 expression, reduces cleaved caspase-3 expression, inhibits production of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial superoxide, suppresses expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, markedly increases transepithelial resistance, decreases blood-brain  permeability, upregulates claudin-, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 expression, reduces nuclear factor-κB p65 and vascular endothelial growth factor expression, and reduces I kappa B alpha, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2, and I kappa B kinase phosphorylation levels. Overall, these findings suggest that Shuxuetong injection has protective effects on brain microvascular endothelial cells after oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion. Moreover, its protective effect is associated with reduction of mitochondrial superoxide production, inhibition of the inflammatory response, and inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2, and the nuclear factor-κB p65 signaling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31190773>The relationship between blood-brain  permeability and enlarged perivascular spaces: a cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p> Enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) have been widely considered as a feature of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) but the pathogenesis of EPVS remains unclear.

This study aimed to investigate the association of EPVS in the centrum semiovale (CSO) and basal ganglia (BG) with BBB permeability.  Consecutive participants free of symptomatic stroke history presented for physical examination were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. CSO- and BG-EPVS on T2-weighted (T2-W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were rated using a five-point validated scale. Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI and Patlak pharmacokinetic model were applied to quantify BBB permeability in the CSO and BG.  A total of 109 participants aged 49-90 years (mean age of 69.85 years) were enrolled. The proportions of participants presenting high-grade (>10) EPVS in the CSO and BG were 50.% and 44.0%, respectively.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a multistrain probiotic on cognitive function, risk of falls, and inflammatory response in patients with cirrhosis. Consecutive outpatients with cirrhosis and cognitive dysfunction (defined by a Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score [PHES] < -4) and/or falls in the previous year were randomized to receive either a sachet of a high-concentration multistrain probiotic containing 450 billion bacteria twice daily for 12 weeks or placebo. We evaluated the changes in cognitive function (PHES); risk of falls (Timed Up and Go [TUG] test, gait speed, and incidence of falls); systemic inflammatory response; neutrophil oxidative burst; intestinal   (serum fatty acid-binding protein 6 [FABP-6] and 2 [FABP-2] and zonulin and urinary claudin-3); bacterial translocation (lipopolysaccharide-binding protein [LBP]); and fecal microbiota. Thirty-six patients were included. Patients treated with the probiotic (n = 18) showed an improvement in the PHES ( = 0.006), TUG time ( = 0.015) and gait speed ( = 0.02), and a trend toward a lower incidence of falls during follow-up (0% compared with 22.2% in the placebo group [n = 18];  = 0.10).

In this study, it is found that carnosol protects human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) through antioxidative mechanisms. First, we measured the antioxidant activity of carnosol. We showed that carnosol pretreatment suppressed tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)-induced cell viability, affected the production of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increased the produce of nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, carnosol promotes the protein expression of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) to keep the  of intercellular junctions, which indicated that it protected microvascular  in oxidative stress. Meanwhile, we investigated that carnosol can interrupt Nrf2-Keap1 protein-protein interaction and stimulated antioxidant-responsive element (ARE)-driven luciferase activity in vitro. Mechanistically, we showed that carnosol promotes the expression of heme oxygenase 1(HO-1) and nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2(Nrf2). It can also promote the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).

We measured albumin, C5a, C5b-9, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6 concentrations in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, and albumin, C5a, and C5b-9 concentrations in urine, using colorimetric or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The ratio of albumin in cerebrospinal fluid to plasma (Q) was used as a surrogate for maternal blood-brain  . Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of C5a, C5b-9, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6 were used as surrogate markers of neuroinflammation. Differences in Q and cerebrospinal fluid protein concentrations between groups were assessed by nonparametric test of medians.Forty-eight subjects were enrolled, which included 16 cases with preeclampsia, 16 control subjects with healthy pregnancy, and 16 control subjects with either chronic or gestational hypertension. Q values were not increased in preeclampsia cases compared with healthy or hypertensive control subjects (Q median, 3. [interquartile range, 2.9-.1] vs 3.9 [interquartile range, 3.0-4.8] vs 3.9 [interquartile range, 3.0-4.8]; P=.78]. Moreover, Q values were not increased in the subset of women with preeclampsia with severe features (n=8) compared with those without severe features (n=8; Q median, 3. [interquartile range, 3.3-4.9] vs 3.7 [interquartile range, 2.3-.]; P=.62]. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of C5a, C5b-9, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 were not increased in cases of preeclampsia, compared with control subjects with either healthy pregnancy, chronic hypertension, or gestational hypertension (P>.05, all comparisons). In contrast to the negative findings in cerebrospinal fluid, plasma concentrations of both C5b-9 and interleukin-6 and urine concentrations of C5a and C5b-9 were increased in cases of preeclampsia.Through measurements of albumin, complement proteins, and cytokines in paired samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid at the time of delivery, we found no evidence of blood-brain  impairment or neuroinflammation in preeclampsia. Larger studies that will investigate a wider range of proteins are suggested to validate our findings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesis that altered gastric permeability is involved in the onset and persistence of this disorder. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate gastric mucosal  and mast cell numbers in patients with FD.We enrolled 58 patients with FD fulfilling the Rome III criteria (H Pylori negative), 20 inflammatory control subjects (H Pylori positive), and 20 healthy controls (H Pylori negative). Probe-based confocal endomicroscopy was performed using intravenous fluorescein to assess the paracellular fluorescein leakage and cell shedding. Mast cells were identified with quantitative immunohistochemistry on mucosal biopsies.Endomicroscopic score of paracellular permeability was significantly higher in H pylori-negative FD patients compared with healthy controls (1.45 ± 1.27 vs 3.69 ± 3.18, P = .006). However, FD patients and healthy controls did not show differences in cell shedding score (0.75 ± 0.79 vs 1.29 ± 1.14, P = .069). Mast cell numbers were significantly increased compared with healthy control samples (18.91 ± .47 vs 14.1 ± 3.88, P < .001). The magnitude of increase in permeability was positively correlated with mast cell numbers of FD patients (rs = .6588, P < .0001), but not dyspepsia symptom scores.Impaired gastric  function is present in FD patients. This might provide a new pathophysiological mechanism and therapeutical target in FD.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483843>Effect of heat stress on blood-brain   in iPS cell-derived microvascular endothelial cell models.</a></h1><p>The incidence of heatstroke has been increasing. Heatstroke has been shown to affect physiological  functions. However, there are few studies of the effect of heat stress on the blood-brain  (BBB) function. In this study, we investigated the influence of heat stress on brain microvascular endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro. Heatstroke model mice administered Texas Red-dextran showed leakage outside the brain vessel walls. In addition, trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) value was significantly reduced in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells under heat stress by reducing claudin- expression. In addition, our results showed that the expression level of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was increased in iPS cell-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells under heat stress. Furthermore, serum from heatstroke model mice could impair the BBB  of iPS cell-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells. These results suggest that BBB  was affected by heat stress in vivo and in vitro and provide important insights into the development of new therapeutic strategies for heatstroke patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30971408>Beneficial effects of exercise on gut microbiota functionality and  , and gut-liver crosstalk in an  model of early obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>Childhood obesity has reached epidemic levels, representing one of the most serious public health concerns associated with metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). There is limited clinical experience concerning pediatric NAFLD patients, and thus the therapeutic options are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefits of exercise on gut microbiota composition and functionality balance, and consequent effects on early obesity and NAFLD onset in an  model. Juvenile (21-day-old) male Wistar rats fed a control diet or a high-fat diet (HFD) were subjected to a combined aerobic and resistance training protocol. Fecal microbiota was sequenced by an Illumina MiSeq system, and parameters related to metabolic syndrome, fecal metabolome, intestinal  , bile acid metabolism and transport, and alteration of the gut-liver axis were measured. Exercise decreased HFD-induced body weight gain, metabolic syndrome and hepatic steatosis, as a result of its lipid metabolism modulatory capacity. Gut microbiota composition and functionality were substantially modified as a consequence of diet, age and exercise intervention. In addition, the training protocol increased ,  and  genera, correlating with a beneficial metabolomic profile, whereas ,  and  showed an opposite pattern. Exercise effectively counteracted HFD-induced microbial imbalance, leading to intestinal  preservation, which, in turn, prevented deregulation of the gut-liver axis and improved bile acid homeostasis, determining the clinical outcomes of NAFLD. In conclusion, we provide scientific evidence highlighting the benefits of gut microbiota composition and functionality modulation by physical exercise protocols in the management of early obesity and NAFLD development.© 2019.

Hindered drug diffusion is caused on the one hand by interactions with the sticky biofilm matrix and on the other hand by the fact that bacterial cells are organized in densely packed clusters of cells. Binding interactions with the biofilm matrix can be avoided by encapsulating the antibiotics into nanocarriers, while interfering with the  of the dense cell clusters can enhance drug transport deep into the biofilm. Vapor nanobubbles (VNB), generated from laser irradiated nanoparticles, are a recently reported effective way to loosen up the biofilm structure in order to enhance drug transport and efficacy. In the present study, we explored if the disruptive force of VNB can be used simultaneously to interfere with the biofilm structure and trigger antibiotic release from light-responsive nanocarriers. The antibiotic tobramycin was incorporated in two types of light-responsive nanocarriers-liposomes functionalized with gold nanoparticles (Lip-AuNP) and graphene quantum dots (GQD)-and their efficacy was evaluated on  biofilms. Even though the anti-biofilm efficacy of tobramycin was improved by liposomal encapsulation, electrostatic functionalization with 70 nm AuNP unfortunately resulted in premature leakage of tobramycin in a matter of hours. Laser-irradiation consequently did not further improve  biofilm eradication. Adsorption of tobramycin to GQD, on the other hand, did result in a stable formulation with high encapsulation efficiency, without burst release of tobramycin from the nanocarriers. However, even though laser-induced VNB formation from GQD resulted in biofilm disruption, an enhanced anti-biofilm effect was not achieved due to tobramycin not being efficiently released from GQD. Even though this study was unsuccessful in designing suitable nanocarriers for simultaneous biofilm disruption and light-triggered release of tobramycin, it provides insights into the difficulties and challenges that need to be considered for future developments in this regard.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081119>High-fat diet intake modulates maternal intestinal adaptations to pregnancy and results in placental hypoxia, as well as altered fetal gut  proteins and immune markers.</a></h1><p>Maternal obesity has been associated with shifts in intestinal microbiota, which may contribute to impaired  function Impaired  function may expose the placenta and fetus to pro-inflammatory mediators We investigated the impacts of diet-induced obesity in mice on maternal and fetal intestinal structure and placental vascularization Diet-induced obesity decreased maternal intestinal short chain fatty acids and their receptors, impaired gut   and was associated with fetal intestinal inflammation. Placenta from obese mothers showed blood vessel immaturity, hypoxia, increased transcript levels of inflammation, autophagy and altered levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers. These data suggest that maternal intestinal changes probably contribute to adverse placental adaptations and also impart an increased risk of obesity in the offspring via alterations in fetal gut development.Shifts in maternal intestinal microbiota have been implicated in metabolic adaptations to pregnancy. In the present study, we generated cohorts of female C57BL/6J mice fed a control (17% kcal fat, n = 10-14) or a high-fat diet (HFD 60% kcal from fat, n = 10-14; ad libitum) aiming to investigate the impact on the maternal gut microbiota, intestinal inflammation and gut  , placental inflammation and fetal intestinal development at embryonic day 18.. HFD was associated with decreased relative abundances of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing genera during pregnancy. These diet-induced shifts paralleled decreased maternal intestinal mRNA levels of SCFA receptor Gpr41, modestly decreased cecal butyrate, and altered mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines and immune cell markers in the maternal intestine. Maternal HFD resulted in impaired gut  , with corresponding increases in circulating maternal levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumour necrosis factor. Placentas from HFD dams demonstrated blood vessel immaturity and hypoxia; decreased free carnitine, acylcarnitine derivatives and trimethylamine-N-oxide; and altered mRNA levels of inflammation, autophagy, and ER stress markers. HFD exposed fetuses had increased activation of nuclear factor-kappa B and inhibition of the unfolded protein response in the developing intestine. Taken together, these data suggest that HFD intake prior to and during pregnancy shifts the composition of the maternal gut microbiota and impairs gut  , resulting in increased maternal circulating LPS, which may ultimate contribute to changes in placental vascularization and fetal gut development.© 2019 The Authors.

Pristine graphene (PG) is an un-functionalized, defect-free type of graphene that could be used as a material for neural interfacing. However, the neurotoxic effects of PG, particularly to the blood-brain  (BBB), have not been fully studied. The BBB separates the brain tissue from the circulating substances in the blood and is essential to maintain the brain homeostasis. The principal components of the BBB are brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs), which maintain a protectively low permeability due to the expression of tight junction proteins. Here we analyzed the effects of PG on BMVECs in an in vitro model of the BBB. BMVECs were treated with PG at 0, 10, 50 and 100 μg/mL for 24 hours and viability and functional analyses of BBB  were performed. PG increased lactate dehydrogenase release at 50 and 100 μg/mL, suggesting the induction of necrosis. Surprisingly, 2,3,-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro--sulfophenyl)--[(phenylamino)-carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium (XTT) conversion was increased at 10 and 50 μg/mL. In contrast, XTT conversion was decreased at 100 μg/mL, suggesting the induction of cell death. In addition, 100 μg/mL PG increased DNA fragmentation, suggesting induction of apoptosis. At the same time, 50 and 100 μg/mL of PG increased the endothelial permeability, which corresponded with a decrease in the expression of the tight junction protein occludin at 100 μg/mL. In conclusion, these results suggest that PG negatively affects the viability and function of the BBB endothelial cells in vitro.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934587>Plasma Rich in Growth Factors (PRGF) Disrupt the Blood-Brain   and Elevate Amyloid Pathology in the Brains of 5XFAD Mice.</a></h1><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting .4 million people in the United States. Currently approved pharmacologic interventions for AD are limited to symptomatic improvement, not affecting the underlying pathology. Therefore, the search for novel therapeutic strategies is ongoing. A hallmark of AD is the compromised blood-brain  (BBB); thus, developing drugs that target the BBB to enhance its  and function could be a novel approach to prevent and/or treat AD. Previous evidence has shown the beneficial effects of growth factors in the treatment of AD pathology. Based on reported positive results obtained with the product Endoret, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) on the BBB  and function, initially in a cell-based BBB model and in 5x Familial Alzheimer's Disease (5xFAD) mice. Our results showed that while PRGF demonstrated a positive effect in the cell-based BBB model with the enhanced  and function of the model, the in-vivo findings showed that PRGF exacerbated amyloid pathology in 5xFAD brains. At 10 and 100% doses, PRGF increased amyloid deposition associated with increased apoptosis and neuroinflammation. In conclusion, our results suggest PRGF may not provide beneficial effects against AD and the consideration to utilize growth factors should further be investigated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30569751>Therapeutic Target and Cell-signal Communication of Chlorpromazine and Promethazine in Attenuating Blood-Brain  Disruption after Ischemic Stroke.</a></h1><p>Ischemic stroke destroys blood-brain  (BBB) . There are currently no effective treatments available in the clinical setting. Post-ischemia treatment with phenothiazine drugs [combined chlorpromazine and promethazine (C+P)] has been shown to be neuroprotective in stroke. The present study determined the effect of C+P in BBB . Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the following groups ( n=8 each): (1) stroke, (2) stroke treated by C+P with temperature control, and (3) stroke treated by C+P without temperature control. Infarct volume and neurological deficits were measured to assess the neuroprotective effect of C+P. BBB permeability was determined by brain edema and Evans blue leakage. Expression of BBB integral molecules, including proteins of aquaporin-4 and -9 (AQP-4, AQP-9), matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 (MMP-2, MMP-9), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), claudin-1/, occludin, and laminin were determined by Western blot. Stroke caused brain infarction and neurological deficits, as well as BBB damage, which were all attenuated by C+P through drug-induced hypothermia. When the reduced temperature was controlled to physiological levels, C+P still conferred neuroprotection, suggesting a therapeutic effect independent of hypothermia. Furthermore, C+P significantly attenuated the increase in AQP-4, AQP-9, MMP-2, and MMP-9 levels after stroke, and reversed the decrease in tight junction protein (ZO-1, claudin-1/, occludin) and basal laminar protein (laminin) levels. This study clearly indicates a beneficial effect of C+P on BBB  after stroke, which may be independent of drug-induced hypothermia. These findings further prove the clinical target and cell-signal communication of C+P treatment, which may direct us closer toward the development of an efficacious neuroprotective therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31059770>Effects of hydroxyethyl starch (HES 130/0.42) on endothelial and epithelial permeability in vitro.</a></h1><p>Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is employed to sustain normovolemia in patients. Using a perfused organ model, we recently showed that HES impairs the intestinal  which is constituted of endothelial and epithelial cell layers. However, the target cells and molecular actions of HES in the intestine are mainly unknown. Employing a model of human endothelial (HUVEC) and intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2), we investigated the impact of HES, albumin and HES/albumin on cellular /permeability and evaluated underlying molecular mechanisms. Monolayers of HUVEC and Caco-2 were cultured with HES (3%), albumin (3%) or HES/albumin (1.%/1.%).  and permeability of the cell layers were evaluated by FITC-dextran transfer, measurements of cell detachment, vitality, cell volume, LDH release and caspase-3/7 activity. Cellular mechanisms were analyzed by Westernblotting for P-akt, P-erk, claudin-3 and I-FABP. HES application resulted in higher numbers of non-adherent/floating HUVEC cells (P<0.05) but did not change vitality or cell volume. Both, HES and HES/albumin increased the permeability of HUVEC monolayers (P<0.001), while LDH release, caspase-3/7 activity, akt/erk phosphorylation and claudin-3 expression were not affected. HES and HES/albumin did not change any of the parameters in cultures of Caco-2 cells. HES is able to disturb the  of the endothelial but not the epithelial  in vitro. HES effects are unrelated to cell damage and apoptosis but may involve reduced cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Cigarette smoke (CS) exposure causes cardiopulmonary disease and COPD and increases the risk for pulmonary tumors. In addition to poor lung function, patients with COPD are susceptible to bouts of dangerous inflammation triggered by pollutants or infection. These severe inflammatory episodes can lead to additional exacerbations, hospitalization, further deterioration of lung function, and reduced survival. Suitable models of the inflammatory conditions associated with CS, which potentiate the downward spiral in patients with COPD, are lacking, and the underlying mechanisms that trigger exacerbations are not well understood. Although initial CS exposure activates a protective role for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) functions in  , chronic exposure depletes the pulmonary VEGF guard function in severe COPD. Thus, we hypothesized that mice with compromised VEGF production and challenged with CS would trigger human-like severe inflammatory progression of COPD. In this model, we discovered that CS exposure promotes an amplified IL-33 cytokine response and severe disease progression. Our -knockout model combined with CS recapitulates severe COPD with an influx of IL-33-expressing macrophages and neutrophils. Normally, IL-33 is quickly inactivated by a post-translational disulfide bond formation. Our results reveal that BAL fluid from the CS-exposed, VEGF-deficient cohort promotes a significantly prolonged lifetime of active proinflammatory IL-33. Taken together, our data demonstrate that with the loss of a VEGF-mediated protective , the CS response switches from a localized danger to an uncontrolled long-term and long-range, amplified, IL-33-mediated inflammatory response that ultimately destroys lung function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518490>Colonic mast cell numbers, symptom profile, and mucosal expression of elements of the epithelial  in irritable bowel syndrome.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to determine whether patients with IBS displayed altered mucosal mast cell (MC) numbers and proportions of MCs co-localizing with nerves compared with healthy subjects (HS) and whether these MC characteristics correlated with IBS symptoms, elements of the epithelial , or visceral sensitivity.Mucosal MC characteristics were determined using immunoassay. IBS symptoms, gene expression of elements of the epithelial , fecal serine protease activity, and visceral sensitivity were assessed.The MC numbers per mm were 2.0 (0.0-6.0) in patients with IBS (n = 43) and 3.

MC characteristics were equivalent in the different IBS subtypes. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified two distinct groups among patients with IBS: MC high (higher MC numbers and proportions of MCs co-localizing with nerves) and MC low (lower MC numbers and proportions of MCs co-localizing with nerves). The MC high and MC low groups could not be discriminated with regard to IBS symptoms, parameters of visceral sensitivity, gene expression of elements of the epithelial , and fecal protease activity.There was no evidence of increased infiltration or altered localization of MCs in the colonic mucosa of patients with IBS. These MC characteristics were not linked to global IBS symptoms or mucosal expression of elements of the epithelial . These findings indicate that quantity and location of mucosal MCs are factors not involved in the pathophysiology of IBS.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914250>Effects of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin on blood-brain  permeability in angiotensin II-induced hypertensive rats.</a></h1><p>The blood-brain  (BBB) permeability primarily increases in cerebral venules during acute hypertension. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), a cholesterol-depleting agent, decreases the expression of caveolins disrupting caveolar structures. We aimed to determine the effects of MβCD on the BBB permeability of angiotensin (ANG) II-induced hypertensive rats. Three minutes after MβCD administration ( mg/kg), acute hypertension was induced by ANG II (60 µg/kg). Evans blue (EB) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) tracers were used to assess BBB permeability. Immunohistochemistry for caveolin (Cav)-1 and tight junction protein claudin- was performed. EB dye content significantly increased in both cerebral cortices and left hippocampus in MβCD (P < 0.05), right cerebral cortex and both hippocampi in ANG II (P < 0.05; P < 0.01), and both cerebral cortices and hippocampi in MβCD plus ANG II groups compared with controls (P < 0.05; P < 0.01). A significant decrease in claudin- immunostaining intensity was observed in animals treated with MβCD compared with controls (P < 0.05). Cav-1 immunostaining intensity increased in ANG II group (P < 0.05). Ultrastructurally, HRP reaction products were observed in endothelial cells of the microvessels in the hippocampus region in MβCD group while the tracer was mainly localized in astrocytes and neurons in ANG II, and MβCD plus ANG II groups. The endothelial cells of the venules in the cerebral cortex of the animals in the latter experimental groups also showed an abundance of caveolar vesicles devoid of HRP reaction products. Our results revealed that MβCD did not provide overall protective effects on BBB  in acute hypertension and even led to BBB disruption in normotensive animals.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Cerebral endothelium protection presents a promising approach in ischemic stroke therapy. In the current study, protective effects of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) on ischemia-induced disruption of BBB  were examined using an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model in bEnd3 cells. Expression levels of claudin- and TJ protein-1 (ZO-1) were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis.

Previous studies of CTE in mice expressing mutant EpCAM show neonatal lethality. Hence, to study the cellular, molecular, and physiological alterations that result from EpCAM mutation, a tamoxifen-inducible mutant EpCAM enteroid model has been generated. The presence of mutant EpCAM in the model was confirmed at both mRNA and protein levels. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated the reduced expression of mutant EpCAM. Mutant enteroids had reduced budding potential as well as significantly decreased mRNA expression for epithelial lineage markers (), proliferation marker  and secretory pathway transcription factors (, . Significantly decreased numbers of Paneth and goblet cells were confirmed by staining. These findings were correlated with intestinal tissue from CTE patients and the mutant mice model that had significantly fewer Paneth and goblet cells than in healthy counterparts. FITC-dextran studies demonstrated significantly impaired  function in monolayers derived from mutant enteroids compared with control monolayers. In conclusion, we have established an ex vivo CTE model. The role of EpCAM in the budding potential, differentiation, and  function of enteroids is noted. Our study establishes new facets of EpCAM biology that will aid in understanding the pathophysiology of CTE and role of EpCAM in health and disease. Here, we develop a novel ex vivo enteroid model for congenital tufting enteropathy (CTE) based on epithelial cell adhesion molecule ( gene mutations found in patients.

The present work evaluated the effect of sperm selection with Sephadex filtration and the supplementation of 2% glycerol (GLY) to extenders based on ultra-heat-treated skimmed milk (UHT) or Tris-Tes-Glucose (TEST) on ram sperm kinetic parameters, plasma membrane , acrosome , mitochondrial function and fertilizing ability, over long chilling times. The results showed that for non-filtered semen, values for progressive sperm motility (%PSM), straight line velocity (VSL, μm/s) and the percentage of sperm with an intact plasma membrane/intact acrosome/a high mitochondrial function index (%IPIAHM) at all times up to 96 h of chilling were higher when the UHT extender (P < 0.01) was used compared to TEST extender irrespective of the presence of GLY. When semen was previously filtered with Sephadex, the addition of GLY to the UHT extender improved total motility (%TM), the %PSM and the VSL at 96 h compared to all other treatments (P < 0.01). The best results of all were obtained with non-filtered semen and UHT either with or without GLY. Heterologous IVF using zona-intact bovine oocytes was used to assess the fertilizing capacity of non-filtered fresh (FS0), chilled-for-24 h (CS24) or chilled-for-48 h (CS48) ram semen diluted in UHT extender (GLY-free). Heterologous IVF showed that ram sperm, either FS0, CS24 or CS48, were equally capable of penetrating zona pellucida intact bovine oocytes, leading to pronuclear formation and hybrid embryo cleavage (46.3 ± 3.2; 48.8 ± 3.2; and 43.3 ± 3., respectively). No differences were seen with respect to fresh sperm in terms of sperm binding, penetration, polyspermy, pronucleus formation or cleavage rates (P > 0.05). In conclusion, neither Sephadex filtration nor addition of glycerol provided extra benefits to ram sperm chilled up to 96 h. Chilled, non-filtered sperm extended with UHT without GLY showed better sperm functionality than did similar sperm extended with TEST extenders. Indeed, sperm diluted in UHT extender, maintained fertilizing ability up to 48 h.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The present study investigated relationships among tight junction protein gene expression, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection, and intestinal mucosal morphology in piglets. We compared the expression of six tight junction proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2, Occludin, Claudin-1, Claudin-4, and Claudin-) between seven-day-old piglets infected with PEDV and normal piglets, as well as in PEDV-infected porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2). We also evaluated differences in mucosal morphology between PEDV-infected and normal piglets. The expression of six tight junction protein genes was lower in PEDV-infected piglets than in the normal animals. The expression of ZO-1, ZO-2, Occludin, and Claudin-4 in the intestine tissue was significantly lower (p⟨0.05) in PEDV-infected than in normal piglets. The expression of Claudin- in the jejunum was significantly lower in PEDV-infected piglets than in the normal animals (p⟨0.01). The expression of Claudin-1 and Claudin- genes in the ileum was significantly higher in PEDV-infected piglets than in normal piglets (p⟨0.01). Morphologically, the intestinal mucosa in PEDV-infected piglets exhibited clear pathological changes, including breakage and shedding of intestinal villi. In PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells, the mRNA expression of the six tight junction proteins showed a downward trend; in particular, the expression of the Occludin and Claudin-4 genes was significantly lower (p⟨0.01). These data suggest that the expression of these six tight junction proteins, especially Occludin and Claudin-4, plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal  and resistance to PEDV infection in piglets.Copyright© by the Polish Academy of Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31328334>Transport stress induces pig jejunum tissue oxidative damage and results in autophagy/mitophagy activation.</a></h1><p>Pig transportation is associated with intestinal oxidative stress and results in destruction of intestinal .

The results showed that transportation induced obvious stress responses with morphological and histological damage in jejunum accompanying with an elevated level of malondialdehyde (MDA; p < .05), endotoxin (LPS; p < .05), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH; p < .05) and a decreased level of serum superoxide dismutase (SOD; p < .05). Also, hemeoxy genase 1 (HO-1; p < .01) as well as tight junction protein (claudin-1 [p < .001], occludin [p < .05] and zonula occludens 1 [ZO-1; p < 0.05]) levels were attenuated in jejunum tissue, and NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1; p < .01) mRNA expression was up-regulated. Further research indicated that transport stress could induce autophagy through increasing microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3; p < .05) and autophagy-related gene  (ATG5; p < .01) levels and suppressing p62 expression. Additionally, transport stress increased the protein levels of PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1; p < .05) and Parkin (p < .05) which was associated with mitophagy. In conclusions, transport stress could induce the destruction of intestinal  and involve in the intestinal mucosal  oxidative damage, and also contribute to activation of autophagy/mitophagy.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191319>Neuroprotective Effects and Hepatorenal Toxicity of Angong Niuhuang Wan Against Ischemia-Reperfusion Brain Injury in Rats.</a></h1><p>Angong Niuhuang Wan (AGNHW) is a classic prescription in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) used for stroke treatment, but its efficacies remain to be confirmed. With its arsenic- and mercury-containing materials, the application of AGNHW raises great safety concerns. Herein, we aim to explore the neuropharmacological effects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury and evaluate the toxicological effects of AGNHW for better use. Male SD rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and following 22 h of reperfusion. AGNHW (257 mg/kg, 1× AGNHW) were orally administered for pharmacological effects and 257, 514, and 1,028 mg/kg (equivalent to 1×, 2×, 4× AGNHW) were used for the toxicological study. The results revealed that AGNHW treatment reduced the infarct size and protected the blood-brain  (BBB)  in the MCAO rat ischemic stroke model. AGNHW treatment up-regulated bcl-2 expression and down-regulated the expressions of Bax, p47, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), and inhibited the expressions and activities of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, and reserved tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin- in the ischemic brains. These results indicated that the neuroprotective mechanisms of AGNHW could be associated with its antioxidant properties by inhibiting oxidative/nitrative stress-mediated MMP activation and protecting tight junction proteins in the ischemic brains. Administration of 1× AGNHW for 7 days would not induce the accumulation of mercury in blood, liver, and kidney at day 14. Administration of 2× AGNHW and 4× AGNHW for 7 days increased the level of mercury in the kidney. For arsenic level, administration of 1× AGNHW for 7 days would increase the level of arsenic in the liver and blood without increase of arsenic in the kidney at day 14. Administration of 2× AGNHW and 4× AGNHW for 7 days would further increase the level of arsenic in the liver and blood. There is no influence on body weight, organ index, histological structures, and renal and liver functions. These results suggest that short-term treatment of AGNHW within 1 week should be safe and has neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586624>On the fluxes of side-chain oxidized oxysterols across blood-brain and blood-CSF barriers and origin of these steroids in CSF (Review).</a></h1><p>In contrast to cholesterol itself the side-chain oxidized metabolites 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24OH) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OH) are able to pass the blood-brain  and the blood-CSF . Most 27OH in circulation is formed extracerebrally and according to catheterization experiments about  mg of it is taken up by the brain per 24 h. 24OH is almost exclusively produced in the brain and about 6 mg fluxes from the brain into the circulation per 24 h. In addition to these major fluxes a very minor fraction of these two oxysterols flux from the circulation into CSF. Isotope experiments have shown that almost all 27OH in CSF originates from the circulation and evidence has been presented that this is the case also with a substantial part of 24OH. The levels of both 24OH and 27OH in CSF are thus affected by the  of the blood-CSF  with higher levels when the  is defect. Both levels of 24OH and 27OH in CSF are increased in connection with neurodegeneration and in general the increase in 24OH levels is higher than the increase in 27OH levels. A number of observations in different type of patients including measurements of other biochemical markers support that the increase in levels of 24OH due to neurodegeneration is due to a release of this oxysterol or its precursor cholesterol from dying neuronal cells. In contrast the increase in levels of 27OH is likely to be a consequence of reduced metabolism due to loss of the neuronal enzyme CYP7B1. We discuss the driving forces behind the fluxes of oxysterols in the brain, the limitations in the flux across the barriers and the diagnostic potential for side-chain oxidized oxysterols in CSF.Copyright © 2018.

Previous studies have reported that the  of the brain endothelium is compromised in a plethora of neuropathologies. Therefore, it is of particular interest to establish a method that enables researchers to investigate and understand the molecular changes in CNS endothelial cells and underlying mechanisms in conjunction with murine models of disease. In the past, approaches to isolate endothelial cells have either involved the use of transgenic reporter mice or suffered from insufficiently pure cell populations and poor yield. This protocol here is based on well-established protocols that were modified and combined to allow single cell isolation of highly pure brain endothelial cell populations using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Briefly, after careful removal of the meninges and dissection of the cortex/hippocampus, the brain tissue is mechanically homogenized and enzymatically digested in two steps resulting in a single cell suspension. Cells are stained with a cocktail of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies identifying not only brain endothelial cells, but also potentially contaminating cell types such as pericytes, astrocytes, and lineage cells. Using flow cytometry, cell populations are separated and sorted directly into either RNA lysis buffer for bulk RNA analyses (., RNA microarray and RNA-Seq) or in pure fetal bovine serum to preserve viability for other downstream applications such as single cell RNA-Seq and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-Seq). The protocol does not require the expression of a transgene to label brain endothelial cells and thus, may be applied to any mouse model. In our hands, the protocol has been highly reproducible with an average yield of 3 × 10 cells from a pool of four adult mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302133>Blood-retinal  protection against high glucose damage: The role of P2X7 receptor.</a></h1><p>Blood retinal  (BRB) breakdown is a hallmark of diabetic retinopathy, whose occurrence in early or later phases of the disease has not yet been completely clarified. Recent evidence suggests that hyperglycemia induces activation of the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) leading to pericyte cell death. We herein investigated the role of P2X7R on retinal endothelial cells viability and expression of tight- and adherens-junctions following high glucose (HG) exposure. We found that HG elicited P2X7R activation and expression and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs). Furthermore, HG exposure caused a decrease in HRECs viability and a damage of the BRB. JNJ47965567, a P2X7R antagonist, protected HRECs from HG-induced damage (LDH release) and preserved the BRB, as shown by transendothelial electrical resistance and cell junction morphology (ZO-1, claudin- and VE-cadherin). Moreover, JNJ47965567 treatment significantly decreased IL-1β expression and release, elicited by HG. These data indicate that P2X7R plays an important role to regulate BRB , in particular the block of this receptor was useful to counteract the damage elicited by HG in HRECs, and warranting further clinical evaluation of P2X7R antagonists for the treatment of diabetic macular edema.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Several analyses were performed to study GYY4137 effects by examining retinal lysates for key protein expressions along with plasma glutamate and glutathione estimations. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was monitored during GYY4137 treatment; barium sulfate and bovine serum albumin conjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate (BSA-FITC) angiographies were performed for examining vasculature and its permeability post-treatment. Vision-guided behavior was also tested employing novel object recognition test (NORT) and light-dark box test (LDBT) recordings.CBS deficiency (CBS) coupled with HMD led disruption of methionine/homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism leading to hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) in CBS mice as reflected by increased Hcy, and s-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) levels. Unlike CBS, cystathionine-γ lyase (CSE), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) levels which were reduced but compensated by GYY4137 intervention. Heightened oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses were mitigated by GYY4137 effects along with enhanced glutathione (GSH) levels. Increased glutamate levels in CBS strain were prominent than WT mice and these mice also exhibited higher IOP that was lowered by GYY4137 treatment. CBS deficiency also resulted in vision-guided behavioral impairment as revealed by NORT and LDBT findings. Interestingly, GYY4137 was able to improve CBS mice behavior together with lowering their glutamate levels. Blood-retinal  (BRB) appeared compromised in CBS with vessels' leakage that was mitigated in GYY4137 treated group. This corroborated the results for occludin (an integral plasma membrane protein of the cellular tight junctions) stabilization.Findings reveal that HHcy-induced glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative damage, ER-stress and vascular permeability alone or together can compromise ocular health and that GYY4137 could serve as a potential therapeutic agent for treating HHcy induced ocular disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30903503>Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Hematopoietic Embryoid Bodies Improve Mouse Status in Septic Peritonitis.</a></h1><p>We examined the efficacy of embryoid bodies from 6-day induced pluripotent stem cells an in vivo sepsis model. Injection of embryoid bodies to septic mice improved the condition of their lungs and significantly increased their survival rate. Although embryoid bodies secretedsphingosine-1-phosphate in vitro, its serum levels in mouse plasma were significantly reduced compared to that in the control (untreated mice receiving PBS). Low concentrations of sphingosine-1-phosphate protected endothelial cells, while high concentrations disrupted endothelial  . Therefore, exogenous sphingosine-1-phosphate secreted by embryoid bodies during early stage of sepsis might down regulate endogenous production of sphingosine-1-phosphate. Inhibition of excessive sphingosine-1-phosphate release protects against endothelial injury and suppresses a vicious cycle of inflammatory reactions. The obtained results open new prospects in induced pluripotent stem cells-based therapy for sepsis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988524>Aberrant oligodendroglial-vascular interactions disrupt the blood-brain , triggering CNS inflammation.</a></h1><p>Disruption of the blood-brain  (BBB) is critical to initiation and perpetuation of disease in multiple sclerosis (MS). We report an interaction between oligodendroglia and vasculature in MS that distinguishes human white matter injury from normal rodent demyelinating injury. We find perivascular clustering of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in certain active MS lesions, representing an inability to properly detach from vessels following perivascular migration. Perivascular OPCs can themselves disrupt the BBB, interfering with astrocyte endfeet and endothelial tight junction , resulting in altered vascular permeability and an associated CNS inflammation. Aberrant Wnt tone in OPCs mediates their dysfunctional vascular detachment and also leads to OPC secretion of Wif1, which interferes with Wnt ligand function on endothelial tight junction . Evidence for this defective oligodendroglial-vascular interaction in MS suggests that aberrant OPC perivascular migration not only impairs their lesion recruitment but can also act as a disease perpetuator via disruption of the BBB.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31417573>Liver X Receptor Alpha Is Important in Maintaining Blood-Brain  Function.</a></h1><p>Dysfunction of the blood-brain  (BBB) contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of several neuroinflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Potential players that regulate BBB function are the liver X receptors (LXRs), which are ligand activated transcription factors comprising two isoforms, LXRα, and LXRβ. However, the role of LXRα and LXRβ in regulating BBB (dys)function during neuroinflammation remains unclear, as well as their individual involvement. Therefore, the goal of the present study is to unravel whether LXR isoforms have different roles in regulating BBB function under neuroinflammatory conditions. We demonstrate that LXRα, and not LXRβ, is essential to maintain   . Specific knockout of LXRα in brain endothelial cells resulted in a more permeable  with reduced expression of tight junctions. Additionally, the observed dysfunction was accompanied by increased endothelial inflammation, as detected by enhanced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) and increased transendothelial migration of monocytes toward inflammatory stimuli. To unravel the importance of LXRα in BBB function , we made use of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) MS mouse model. Induction of EAE in a constitutive LXRα knockout mouse and in an endothelial specific LXRα knockout mouse resulted in a more severe disease score in these animals. This was accompanied by higher numbers of infiltrating leukocytes, increased endothelial VCAM-1 expression, and decreased expression of the tight junction molecule claudin-. Together, this study reveals that LXRα is indispensable for maintaining BBB  and its immune quiescence. Targeting the LXRα isoform may help in the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent BBB dysfunction, and thereby neuroinflammatory disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208230>Initiating TrkB/Akt Signaling Cascade Preserves Blood-Brain  after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Rats.</a></h1><p>The  of the blood-brain  (BBB) plays a vital role in affecting the prognosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This study aimed to investigate activation of the Tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB) and its downstream signaling pathway on preserving BBB breakdown after experimental SAH. An endovascular perforation SAH model was applied. N-[2-(-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl) ethyl]-2- oxopiperidine-3-carboxamide (HIOC), the derivative of N-acetyl serotonin (NAS), was intracerebroventricularly administered 3 h after SAH induction. The neurologic scores and brain water content were evaluated in an outcome study. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining were used to investigate the mechanism. The results indicated that HIOC activated the TrkB/Akt pathway, increased the tight junction expression, improved neurologic deficits, and ameliorated brain edema after SAH. Thus, we conclude that initiating the TrkB/Akt signaling cascade preserves BBB breakdown after experimental SAH in rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30972065>Immune Cell-Epithelial/Mesenchymal Interaction Contributing to Allergic Airway Inflammation Associated Pathology.</a></h1><p>The primary function of the lung is efficient gas exchange between alveolar air and alveolar capillary blood. At the same time, the lung protects the host from continuous invasion of harmful viruses and bacteria by developing unique epithelial  systems. Thus, the lung has a complex architecture comprising a mixture of various types of cells including epithelial cells, mesenchymal cells, and immune cells. Recent studies have revealed that Interleukin (IL-)33, a member of the IL-1 family of cytokines, is a key environmental cytokine that is derived from epithelial cells and induces type 2 inflammation in the  organs, including the lung. IL-33 induces allergic diseases, such as asthma, through the activation of various immune cells that express an IL-33 receptor, ST2, including ST2 memory (CD62LCD44) CD4 T cells. ST2 memory CD4 T cells have the capacity to produce high levels of IL- and Amphiregulin and are involved in the pathology of asthma. ST2 memory CD4 T cells are maintained by IL-7- and IL-33-produced lymphatic endothelial cells within inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) around the bronchioles during chronic lung inflammation. In this review, we will discuss the impact of these immune cells-epithelial/mesenchymal interaction on shaping the pathology of chronic allergic inflammation. A better understanding of pathogenic roles of the cellular and molecular interaction between immune cells and non-immune cells is crucial for the development of new therapeutic strategies for intractable allergic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31267346>Amyloid Beta 25-35 induces blood-brain  disruption in vitro.</a></h1><p>The amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) is transported across the blood-brain  (BBB) by binding with the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). Previously, we demonstrated that the Aβ fraction 25-35 (Aβ) increases RAGE expression in the rat hippocampus, likely contributing to its neurotoxic effects. However, it is still debated if the interaction of Aβ with RAGE compromises the BBB  in Alzheimer' disease (AD). Here, we evaluated the effects of Aβ in an established in vitro model of the BBB. Rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (rBMVECs) were treated with 20 μM active Aβ or the inactive Aβ (control), for 24 h. Exposure to Aβ significantly decreased cell viability, increased cellular necrosis, and increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which triggered a decrease in the enzyme glutathione peroxidase when compared to the control condition. Aβ also increased BBB permeability by altering the expression of tight junction proteins (decreasing zonula occludens-1 and increasing occludin). Aβ induced monolayer disruption and cellular disarrangement of the BBB, with RAGE being highly expressed in the zones of disarrangement. Together, these data suggest that Aβ-induces toxicity by compromising the functionality and integrity of the BBB in vitro.

Caco-2 spontaneously differentiate into a monolayer expressing several specific characteristics, typically showed by mature enterocytes. For in vitro experiments, it is crucial to identify non-invasive and non-destructive techniques able to evaluate the  and differentiation of the cells monolayer. Thus, we aimed to assess these properties by analyzing electrical impedance measurements.Caco-2 cells were differentiated for 21 days. The monolayer  and differentiation were primarily evaluated by means of morphological, biochemical and molecular data. Impedance measurements in a range of frequencies from 400 Hz to 50 kHz were performed using a dedicated set up, including customized Aerosol Jet Printed carbon-based sensors.The trends of RI observed at three different frequencies were able to describe cell growth and differentiation. In order to evaluate which frequencies better correlate with cell differentiation, Principal Component Analysis have been employed and the concordance analysis between RI magnitude and morphological, biochemical and molecular data, highlighted 40 kHz as the optimal frequency to assess Caco-2 cells differentiation process.We demonstrated the feasibility and reliability of applying impedance-based measurements not only to provide information about the monolayer status, but also for cell differentiation monitoring.This study underlined the possibility to use a dedicated sensor to assess the  and differentiation of Caco-2 monolayer, as a reliable non-destructive alternative to conventional approaches.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Black ginseng (BG), steamed 9 times and dried ginseng, and its major protopanaxatriol type ginsenosides (ginsenoside Rg4, Rg6, Rh4, Rh1, and Rg2) exhibited various biological activities including anti-septic, anti-diabetic, wound healing, immune-stimulatory, and anti-antioxidant activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the beneficial effects of Rgx365 (a protopanaxatriol type rare ginsenosides fraction) on PM-induced lung endothelial cell (EC)  disruption and pulmonary inflammation. Permeability, leukocyte migration, activation of proinflammatory proteins, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and histology were examined in PM-treated EC and mice. Rgx365 significantly scavenged PM-induced ROS, inhibited ROS-induced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), activated Akt in purified pulmonary EC, which helped maintain endothelial . Further, Rgx365 reduced vascular protein leakage, leukocyte infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine release in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids in PM-induced mouse lung tissues.

The mechanisms that enable pathogens to traverse the blood-brain  (BBB) are incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the role of a newly identified Fic domain-containing protein, BifA, in SEZ virulence. BifA was required for SEZ to cross the BBB and to cause meningitis in mice. BifA also enhanced SEZ translocation across human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cell (hBMEC) monolayers. Purified BifA or its Fic domain-containing C-terminus alone were able to enter into hBMECs, leading to disruption of monolayer  . A SILAC-based proteomic screen revealed that BifA binds moesin. BifA's Fic domain was required for its binding to this regulator of host cell cytoskeletal processes. BifA treatment of hBMECs led to moesin phosphorylation and downstream RhoA activation. Inhibition of moesin activation or moesin depletion in hBMEC monolayers abrogated BifA-mediated increases in  permeability and SEZ's capacity to translocate across monolayers. Thus, BifA activation of moesin appears to constitute a key mechanism by which SEZ disrupts endothelial monolayer  to penetrate the BBB.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31410747>Jasonia glutinosa (L.) DC., a traditional herbal medicine, reduces inflammation, oxidative stress and protects the intestinal  in a murine model of colitis.</a></h1><p>Jasonia glutinosa (L.) DC., known as rock tea (RT), is traditionally used in Spain as a digestive due to its beneficial properties in bowel disorders. The pharmacological nature of these properties has not been established yet. The aim of this work was to evaluate the therapeutic utility of RT in experimental colitis and to identify chemical constituents with anti-inflammatory and/or anti-oxidative properties. RT extract was prepared with ethanol in a Soxhlet apparatus and analysed by HPLC-DAD. Superoxide radical scavenging properties, xanthine oxidase and lipoxygenase (-LOX) inhibitory activity, and capability to lower nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) levels were measured in cell-free and cell-based assays. In the 2.%-dextran-sodium sulphate (DSS) injury-repair model of ulcerative colitis (UC), mice were daily treated with sulfasalazine (SSZ, as reference drug, 100 mg/kg bw), RT (, 25 and 50 mg/kg bw, p.o.), or vehicle over 20 days. Colitis was scored daily. Colon samples were examined macroscopically and histopathologically. Protein levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukins 6, and 10 (IL-6, IL-10), inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were studied as markers of oxidative stress and inflammatory activity. The  of the apical epithelial layer was assessed by immunofluorescence staining of zonula ocludens-1 (ZO-1). Finally, intestinal contractility was also evaluated by isometric myography. Fifteen phenolic compounds and three pigments were identified and quantified, of which caffeoylquinic acids, and the flavonoid, quercetin-3-O-galactoside, were the most abundant. RT extract significantly scavenged superoxide radicals, inhibited -LOX activity, and lowered NO and TNF-α levels. DSS-treated mice receiving RT scored clinically lower than controls during the first 3 days of DSS treatment and during the recovery period. SSZ was less effective than RT. Anatomical and histological examination of colon samples revealed that RT significantly prevented colon shortening, increased colon thickness, and lowered the macroscopic damage score. RT also significantly prevented the increase of MPO activity, IL-6 levels, iNOS and COX-2 expression, the loss of ZO-1 apical expression, and normalized contractility disturbances. In conclusion, daily administration of RT showed therapeutic properties in the DSS-model of UC. The benefits of RT can likely be attributed to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant phenolic and flavonoid constituents.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31091284>Circulating sphingosine-1-phosphate as a prognostic biomarker for community-acquired pneumonia.</a></h1><p>Early determination of the severity of Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) is essential for better disease prognosis. Current predictors are suboptimal, and their clinical utility remains to be defined, highlighting the need for developing biomarkers with efficacious prognostic value. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid with a documented regulatory role in immune defense and maintenance of endothelial  . For early diagnose of CAP and recognition of severe CAP patients, we conduct this pilot study to access the potential utility of the circulating S1P in an Emergency department setting. In the prospective study, plasma S1P levels were quantified in healthy controls and patients with CAP. Also, their discriminating power was assessed by receiver operating characteristic analysis. The association between S1P levels and disease severity indices was assessed by Spearman correlation and logistic regression tests. Patients with CAP had significantly higher plasma S1P levels than healthy individuals (CAP: 27.54 ng/ml, IQR = 14.37-49.99 ng/ml; Controls: 10.58 ng/ml, IQR = 4.781-18.91 ng/ml; p < 0.0001). S1P levels were inversely correlated with disease severity in patients with CAP. Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, the plasma S1P concentrations showed significant predicting power for mortality (OR: 0.909; CI: 0.801-0.985; p < 0.05), intensive care unit admission (OR: 0.89; CI: 0.812-0.953; p < 0.005) and long hospital stay (OR: 0.978; CI: 0.961-0.992; p < 0.005). Interestingly, significantly elevated levels of S1P were noted in patients who received methylprednisolone treatment during hospitalization. These results suggest that S1P may be associated with the pathogenesis of CAP and may have prognostic utility in CAP and its therapy, especially in the Emergency Department setting.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926390>Impairment of pericyte-endothelium crosstalk leads to blood-brain  dysfunction following traumatic brain injury.</a></h1><p>The blood-brain  (BBB) constitutes a neurovascular unit formed by microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes. Brain pericytes are important regulators of BBB , permeability, and blood flow. Pericyte loss has been implicated in injury; however, how the crosstalk among pericytes, endothelial cells, and astrocytes ultimately leads to BBB dysfunction in traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of pericyte-endothelium interaction in maintaining the BBB function. TBI causes the platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B)/PDGF receptor-β signaling impairment that results in loss of interaction with endothelium and leads to neurovascular dysfunction. Using in vivo mild (7 psi) and moderate (15 psi) fluid percussion injury (FPI) in mice, we demonstrate the expression of various pericyte markers including PDGFR-β, NG2 and CD13 that were significantly reduced with a subsequent reduction in the expression of various integrins; adherent junction protein, N-cadherin; gap junction protein, connexin-43; and tight junction proteins such as occludin, claudin-, ZO-1, and JAM-a. Impairment of pericyte-endothelium interaction increases the BBB permeability to water that is marked by a significant increase in aquaporin4 expression in injured animals. Similarly, pericyte-endothelium  impairment in FPI animals greatly increases the permeability of small-molecular-weight sodium fluorescein and high-molecular-weight-tracer Evans blue across the BBB. In addition, the injury-inflicted animals show significantly higher levels of S100β and NSE in the blood samples compared with controls. In conclusion, our data provide an insight that brain trauma causes an early impairment of pericyte-endothelium  and results in BBB dysregulation that initiates pathological consequences associated with TBI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
