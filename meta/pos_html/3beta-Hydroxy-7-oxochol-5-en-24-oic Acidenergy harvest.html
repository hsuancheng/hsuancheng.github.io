Bananas undergo a rapid ripening process after , resulting in a short shelf. In this study, the mechanism underlying pulp ripening of harvested bananas was investigated using integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analysis. Ribonucleic  sequencing (RNA-Seq) revealed that a great number of genes related to transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, cell wall modification, and secondary metabolism were up-regulated during pulp ripening. At the protein level, 84 proteins were differentially expressed during pulp ripening, most of which were associated with  metabolism, oxidation-reduction, cell wall metabolism, and starch degradation. According to partial least squares discriminant analysis, 33 proteins were identified as potential markers for separating different ripening stages of the fruit. In addition to ethylene's central role, auxin signal transduction might be involved in regulating pulp ripening. Moreover, secondary metabolism,  metabolism, and the protein metabolic process also played an important role in pulp ripening. In all, this study provided a better understanding of pulp ripening of harvested bananas.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25381750>Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype regulates body weight and fatty  utilization-Studies in gene-targeted replacement mice.</a></h1><p>Of the three human apolipoprotein E (APOE) alleles, the ε3 allele is most common, which may be a result of adaptive evolution. In this study, we investigated whether the APOE genotype affects body weight and  metabolism through regulation of fatty  utilization.Targeted replacement mice expressing the human APOE3 were significantly heavier on low- and high-fat diets compared to APOE4 mice. Particularly on high-fat feeding, food intake and dietary  yields as well as fat mass were increased in APOE3 mice. Fatty  mobilization determined as activation of adipose tissue lipase and fasting plasma nonesterified fatty  levels were significantly lower in APOE3 than APOE4 mice. APOE4 mice, in contrast, exhibited higher expression of proteins involved in fatty  oxidation in skeletal muscle.Our data suggest that APOE3 is associated with the potential to more efficiently  dietary  and to deposit fat in adipose tissue, while APOE4 carriers tend to increase fatty  mobilization and utilization as fuel substrates especially under high-fat intake. The different handling of dietary  may have contributed to the evolution and worldwide distribution of the ε3 allele.© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These proteins are synthesized de novo in the cytoplasm and transported to the storage organelles where they serve as reservoir of  and supplement of nitrogen during rapid growth and development. Sweetpotato is the seventh most important food crop worldwide, and has a significant contribution to the source of nutrition, albeit with low protein content. To determine the behaviour of seed storage proteins in non-native system, a seed albumin, AmA1, was overexpressed in sweetpotato with an additional aim of improving nutritional quality of tuber proteins. Introduction of AmA1 imparted an increase in protein and amino  contents as well as the phytophenols. The proteometabolomics analysis revealed a rebalancing of the proteome, with no significant effects on the global metabolome profile of the transgenic tubers. Additionally, the slower degradation of starch and cellulose in transgenic tubers, led to increased post- durability. Present study provides a new insight into the role of a seed storage protein in the modulation of photoassimilate movement and nutrient acquisition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29705611>Anaerobic digestion of high-yielding tropical  crops for biomethane production: Effects of crop types, locations and plant parts.</a></h1><p>This study examined the composition and anaerobic digestibility of the different plant parts of two high-yielding tropical  crops, Energycane and Napier grass, collected across three locations and two seasons. Both biomass composition and biomethane yields varied significantly with crop types, plant parts and  seasons. In Energycane, specific methane yield (SMY) (Nm (kg VS)) was higher from stems (0.232 ± 0.003) than leaves (0.224 ± 0.003), while in Napier grass, SMY was higher from leaves (0.243 ± 0.002) than stems (0.168 ± 0.002). Energycane had higher specific and total (Nm ha year) methane yields (0.230 ± 0.002 and 8749 ± 494, respectively) than Napier grass (0.192 ± 0.002 and 5575 ± 494, respectively). The SMYs from biomass correlated negatively with  detergent fiber, cellulose and lignin content in the biomass. Energycane and Napier grass had lower specific but comparable total methane yields (TMYs) with maize. The ecological, economic and environmental merits associated with perennial crops suggest they could outperform maize as a substrate for bioenergy production.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

WAS solubilization by the 3-h enzymatic pretreatment (a blend of hydrolytic enzymes caused over 5300 mg/L soluble COD release) prompted volatile fatty  (VFA) production with 3580 mg COD/L after 10-d fermentation. After solid-liquid separation, fermentation liquid with high VFA content was fed into MFCs for electric  production, while solid residues were used for making building materials (such as blended cements). Results showed that the electricity conversion efficiency of fermentation liquid (VFA) reached 1.254 kW h/kg COD with over 90% organics removal and solid residues could be consumed potentially as qualified substitutes for producing cements. As such, this study may provide some new thinking on future WAS management towards electricity /resource reuse with zero secondary wastes discharge.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Microbes regulate the host immune system, in part, by producing metabolites. A mounting body of evidence indicates that diverse microbial metabolites profoundly regulate the immune system via host receptors and other target molecules. Immune cells express metabolite-specific receptors such as P2X , GPR41, GPR43, GPR109A, aryl hydrocarbon receptor precursor (AhR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), TGR5 and other molecular targets. Microbial metabolites and their receptors form an extensive array of signals to respond to changes in nutrition, health and immunological status. As a consequence, microbial metabolite signals contribute to nutrient  from diet, and regulate host metabolism and the immune system. Importantly, microbial metabolites bidirectionally function to promote both tolerance and immunity to effectively fight infection without developing inflammatory diseases. In pathogenic conditions, adverse effects of microbial metabolites have been observed as well. Key immune-regulatory functions of the metabolites, generated from carbohydrates, proteins and bile , are reviewed in this article.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28464234>Periodic harvesting of microalgae from calcium alginate hydrogels for sustained high-density production.</a></h1><p>High-density biomass production is currently only realized in biofilm-based photobioreactors.  yields of whole biofilms are self-limited by daughter-upon-parent cell growth that hinders light and leads to respiratory biomass losses. In this work, we demonstrate a sustainable multi- approach for prolonged generation of high-density biomass. Calcium-alginate hydrogel cultures loaded with Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 achieved production densities comparable to that of biofilms (10  cells/mL) and optimal total productivity in  periods of 2 or 3 days that allowed high-density surface growth without self-limiting cell buildup or surface death. Cross-linking calcium concentration had a strong influence on surface growth and  yields, especially in the first harvests. Subsequent harvests achieved more uniform biomass yields and distributions, unaffected by bulk respiration or light penetration. Collectively, these results demonstrate the feasibility of sustained, high-density biomass production by periodic harvesting within microalgal hydrogel cultures. Biotechnol.

Phycobiliprotein, fatty , exopolysaccharides, pigment content, and the main macromolecules composition were analysed to determine the effect of wavelength on multiple compounds of commercial interest. The results demonstrate that green light plays a significant role in the growth of rhodophyta, due to phycobiliproteins being able to  green wavelengths where chlorophyll pigments absorb poorly. However, under multi-chromatic LED wavelengths, P. purpureum biomass accumulated the highest yield of valuable products such as eicosapentaenoic  (∼2.9% DW), zeaxanthin (∼586μggDW), β-carotene (397μggDW), exopolysaccharides (2.05g/L), and phycobiliproteins (∼4.8% DW). This increased accumulation is likely to be the combination of both photo-adaption and photo-protection, under the combined specific wavelengths employed.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it still showed undesirable performance because of the challenge to control the orientation (such as vertical alignment) of PANI nanostructure for extracellular electron transfer (EET). In this work, vertically aligned polyaniline (VA-PANI) on carbon cloth electrode surface were prepared by in-situ polymerization method (simply tuning the ratio of tartaric  (TA) dopant). Impressively, the VA-PANI greatly improved the EET due to the increased opportunity to connect with conductive proteins. Eventually, MFC equipped with the VA-PANI electrodes delivered a power output of 853 mW/m, which greatly outperformed those electrodes modified with un-oriented PANI.

In this respect, material-independent and rapid coating strategies are highly demanded. We demonstrate spray-assisted nanocoating of supramolecular metal-organic complexes of tannic  and ferric ions. The spray coating developed is material-independent and extremely rapid (<5 sec), allowing for coating of commodity goods, such as shoe insoles and fruits, in the controlled fashion.

All the silages were stored at 25 ºC. Parameters such as pH, microorganism and volatile fatty  contents, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber,  detergent fiber, net gas, metabolizable , organic matter digestibility, dry matter intake and relative feed value were measured to determine fermentation quality, chemical compositions and relative feed value of alfalfa silages.Significant differences were found among the control and treated groups in terms of pH and microorganism contents at all opening times and crude protein, net gas, metabolizable  and organic matter digestibility of final silage. The pH values ranged from 4.70 to 5.52 for all treatments and control silage had the highest value of overall treatments at T75d silages. Volatile fatty  of silages was not influenced significantly by inoculations. However, lactic  content of L. bifermentans (LS-65-2-1) was higher than the other treatments. The highest metabolizable  and organic matter digestibility were recorded from L. citerum (L-70-6-1) inoculation.

The aim of this review is to focus on the effects of short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), which are the main products of gut microbial fermentation from non-digestible carbohydrates in the colon, on the gut-brain axis. Evidence is accumulating regarding the role of SCFAs in the fine-tuning of the gut-brain axis, a feedback system which is vital not only for the proper maintenance of gastrointestinal and metabolic functions, but also for the regulation of food intake and  expenditure. SCFAs are thought to play a key role in increasing the host capacity to  excess  from the diet. SCFAs, however, can exert their effects on the host metabolism via multiple complementary pathways. Metabolic, inflammatory, and neural pathways can be regulated by SCFAs, which can act by sensing nutritional status, thereby maintaining body  homeostasis. SCFA production from prebiotic consumption is the rationale for targeting intestinal mechanisms to increase  expenditure and thereby reduce obesity risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29788095>Effects of maturity at  on the nutritive value and ruminal digestion of Eragrostis tef (cv. Moxie) when fed to beef cattle.</a></h1><p>Teff (Eragrostis tef cv. Moxie), a warm-season annual grass, could be an excellent forage for beef cattle. However, there is limited information on its nutritive value to cattle when harvested at different stages of maturity. Thus, the objective of this research was to determine the effect of feeding teff hay harvested at the boot (BT), early-heading (EH), or late-heading (LH) stages of maturity on nutrient intake, ruminal fermentation characteristics, omasal nutrient flow, and N utilization in beef cattle. Six ruminally cannulated beef heifers (mean initial BW ± SD, 476 ± 32.6) were used in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design with 28-d periods (18 d for adaptation and 10 d for measurements). Dry matter intake was measured daily. Indwelling pH loggers were used to measure ruminal pH from days 21 to 28. Ruminal fluid and omasal digesta were collected from days 26 to 28 to determine fermentation characteristics and omasal nutrient flow. Fecal and urine samples to quantify N excretion were also collected (days 26 to 28). Blood samples for plasma urea-N (PUN) determination were collected 3 h post-feeding on day 28. There were no changes (P > 0.28) in the ADF or NDF content of teff with advancing maturity, but indigestible NDF increased (P < 0.01) with increasing maturity. Maturity had no effect (P ≥ 0.14) on DMI, and ruminal total short-chain fatty  (SCFA) concentration, pH, digestibility, and outflow of DM, OM, NDF, ADF, and CP. However, the CP content of BT hay was greater (P < 0.01) than for EH and LH hay (18.1, 14.1, and 11.5%, respectively, DM basis), and this resulted in the higher CP intake (P < 0.01) for heifers fed the BT than the EH and LH hay. Consequently, ruminal ammonia-N (NH3-N) concentration was greater (P < 0.01) for heifers fed BT than EH and LH hay, thereby possibly explaining the tendency for a decrease (P = 0.08) in PUN concentration, and a decrease (P < 0.01) in the excretion of total N, urine N, and urea-N (UUN) with advancing maturity. However, fecal N excretion (g/d) did not differ (P = 0.76). In conclusion, despite a decrease in CP intake and ruminal NH3-N concentration, feeding beef heifers EH and LH compared to BT teff hay did not compromise ruminal digestion and outflow of DM, OM, NDF, ADF, and CP, and microbial protein synthesis. Advancing maturity in teff hay also resulted in a decrease in the excretion of total N and urine N and UUN when fed to cattle.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27058556>The Intestinal Microbiota in Metabolic Disease.</a></h1><p>Gut bacteria exert beneficial and harmful effects in metabolic diseases as deduced from the comparison of germfree and conventional mice and from fecal transplantation studies. Compositional microbial changes in diseased subjects have been linked to adiposity, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. Promotion of an increased expression of intestinal nutrient transporters or a modified lipid and bile  metabolism by the intestinal microbiota could result in an increased nutrient absorption by the host. The degradation of dietary fiber and the subsequent fermentation of monosaccharides to short-chain fatty  (SCFA) is one of the most controversially discussed mechanisms of how gut bacteria impact host physiology. Fibers reduce the  density of the diet, and the resulting SCFA promote intestinal gluconeogenesis, incretin formation and subsequently satiety. However, SCFA also deliver  to the host and support liponeogenesis. Thus far, there is little knowledge on bacterial species that promote or prevent metabolic disease. Clostridium ramosum and Enterococcus cloacae were demonstrated to promote obesity in gnotobiotic mouse models, whereas bifidobacteria and Akkermansia muciniphila were associated with favorable phenotypes in conventional mice, especially when oligofructose was fed. How diet modulates the gut microbiota towards a beneficial or harmful composition needs further research. Gnotobiotic animals are a valuable tool to elucidate mechanisms underlying diet-host-microbe interactions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26773306>Aspalathin, a dihydrochalcone C-glucoside, protects H9c2 cardiomyocytes against high glucose induced shifts in substrate preference and apoptosis.</a></h1><p> deprivation in the myocardium is associated with impaired heart function. This study aims to investigate if aspalathin (ASP) can ameliorate hyperglycemic-induced shift in substrate preference and protect the myocardium against cell apoptosis.H9c2 cells were exposed to, either normal (5.5 mM) or high (33 mM) glucose concentrations for 48 h. Thereafter, cells exposed to 33 mM glucose were treated with metformin (1 μM) or ASP (1 μM), as well as a combination of metformin and ASP for 6 h. In vitro studies revealed that ASP improved glucose metabolism by decreasing fatty  uptake and subsequent β-oxidation through the decreased expression of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase threonine 172 (pAMPK (Thr172)) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), while increasing acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) expression. ASP inhibited high glucose induced loss of membrane potential in H9c2 cells as observed by an increase in 5' ,6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3' -tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1) ratio (orange\red fluorescence) and decreased apoptosis by reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species and DNA nick formation, while increasing glutathione, superoxide dismutase, uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), and Bcl-2\Bax ratio.Our study provides evidence that ASP increases glucose oxidation and modulates fatty  utilization producing a favorable substrate shift in H9c2 cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose. Such a favorable shift will be of importance in the protection of cardiomyocytes in the diabetic heart.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

SBES was operated with food waste as substrate and evaluated for simultaneous production of electrofuels viz., bioelectricity, biohydrogen (H2) and bioethanol. The system illustrated maximum open circuit voltage and power density of 443 mV and 162.4 mW/m(2), respectively on 9 th day of operation while higher H2 production rate (21.9 ml/h) was observed on 19th day of operation. SBES system also documented 4.85% w/v bioethanol production on 20th day of operation. The analysis of end products confirmed that H2 production could be generally attributed to a mixed acetate/butyrate-type of fermentation. Nevertheless, the presence of additional metabolites in SBES, including formate, lactate, propionate and ethanol, also suggested that other metabolic pathways were active during the process, lowering the conversion of substrate into H2. SBES also documented 72% substrate (COD) removal efficiency along with value added product generation. Continuous evolution of volatile fatty  as intermediary metabolites resulted in pH drop and depicted its negative influence on SBES performance. Bio-electrocatalytic analysis was carried out to evaluate the redox catalytic capabilities of the biocatalyst. Experimental data illustrated that solid-state fermentation can be effectively integrated in SBES for the production of value added products with the possibility of simultaneous solid waste remediation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Unraveling the microbial taxa and functional capacity of gut microbiome associated with feed efficiency can provide important knowledge to improve pig feed efficiency in swine industry. In the current research, we studied the association of fecal microbiota with feed efficiency in 280 commercial Duroc pigs. All experimental pigs could be clustered into two enterotype-like groups. Different enterotypes showed the tendency of association with the feed efficiency ( = 0.07). We further identified 31 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showing the potential associations with porcine feed efficiency. These OTUs were mainly annotated to the bacteria related to the metabolisms of dietary polysaccharides. Although we did not identify the RFI-associated bacterial species at FDR < 0.05 level, metagenomic sequencing analysis did find the distinct function capacities of gut microbiome between the high and low RFI pigs (FDR < 0.05). The KEGG orthologies related to nitrogen metabolism, amino  metabolism, and transport system, and eight KEGG pathways including glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism were positively associated with porcine feed efficiency. We inferred that gut microbiota might improve porcine feed efficiency through promoting intestinal health by the SCFAs produced by fermenting dietary polysaccharides and improving the utilization of dietary protein.

Soybean, an economically important oil and protein crop, is prone to drought resulting in yield instability. Salicylic  (SA), a multifaceted growth hormone, modulates a series of parallel processes to confer drought tolerance thereby relieving yield limitations. The present study was performed in soybean plants treated with SA (0.5 mM) through seed pretreatment under drought regimes: severe stress (50% RWC) and moderate stress (75% RWC), and rehydration. Differential leaf proteome profiling with morphological, physiological and antioxidative metabolism studies were performed at two developmental stages (vegetative and flowering). This explained the tolerance attribution to soybean throughout the development attaining yield stability. Abundance of proteins involved in photosynthesis and ATP synthesis generated  driving metabolic processes towards plant growth, development and stress acclimation. Carbon (C) metabolism proteins involved in growth, osmoregulation and C partition relieved drought-induced C impairment under SA. Defensive mechanisms against redox imbalance and protein misfolding and degradation under stress were enhanced as depicted by the abundance of proteins involved in redox balance and protein synthesis, assembly and degradation at vegetative stage. Redox signaling in chloroplast and its interplay with SA signaling triggered different defense responses as shown through thioredoxin protein abundance. Amino  metabolism proteins abundance resulted in increased osmoprotectants accumulation like proline at initial stage which contributed later towards N (nitrogen) remobilization to developing sink. At later stage, abundance of these proteins maintained redox homeostasis and N remobilization for improved sink strength. The redox homeostasis was supported by the increased antioxidative metabolism in SA treated plants. The downregulation of proteins at flowering also contributed towards N remobilization. Yield potential was improved by SA under drought through acclimation with enhanced N and C remobilization to sink as demonstrated by increased yield parameters like seed number and weight per plant, thousand seed weight and  index. The potential of SA in conferring drought tolerance to plants to maintain sustainable yield possess future research interests.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

It increases the host's ability to   from the digested food, and produces metabolites and microbial products such as short-chain fatty , secondary bile , and lipopolysaccharides. These metabolites and microbial products act as signaling molecules that modulate appetite, gut motility,  uptake and storage, and  expenditure. Several findings suggest that the gut microbiota can affect the development of obesity. Germ-free mice are leaner than conventionally raised mice and they are protected against diet-induced obesity. Furthermore, obese humans and rodents have an altered gut microbiota composition with less phylogeneic diversity compared to lean controls, and transplantation of the gut microbiota from obese subjects to germ-free mice can transfer the obese phenotype. Taken together, these findings indicate a role for the gut microbiota in obesity and suggest that the gut microbiota could be targeted to improve metabolic diseases like obesity. This review focuses on the role of the gut microbiota in  balance regulation and its potential role in obesity.© 2017 S.

FA and LA yields were improved by univariate optimization of the main reaction parameters: concentration of the  catalyst, solid/liquid ratio of the reaction mixture, hydrolysis temperature, and reaction time. The catalytic performances were investigated adopting the efficient microwave (MW) irradiation, allowing significant  and time savings. The best FA and LA yields were further confirmed using a traditionally heated autoclave reactor, giving very high results, when compared with the literature. Hydrolysis temperature and time were the main reaction variables to be carefully optimized: FA formation needed milder reaction conditions, while LA more severe ones. The effect of the crop management (e.g.,  time) on FA/LA production was discussed, revealing that  time was not a discriminating parameter for the further optimization of both FA and LA production, due to the very high productivity of the giant reed throughout the year. The promising results demonstrate that giant reed represents a very interesting candidate for a very high contemporary production of FA and LA of up to about 70% and 90% of the theoretical yields, respectively.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542466>Influence of cold stress on contents of soluble sugars, vitamin C and free amino  including gamma-aminobutyric  (GABA) in spinach (Spinacia oleracea).</a></h1><p>The contents of soluble sugars (sucrose, fructose, glucose, maltose and raffinose), vitamin C and free amino  (34 compounds, essential and non-essential) were quantified in open-field and greenhouse-grown spinaches in response to cold stress using liquid chromatography. In general, greenhouse cultivation produced nutritionally high value spinach in a shorter growing period, where the soluble sugars, vitamin C and total amino  concentrations, including essential were in larger amounts compared to those grown in open-field scenarios. Further, low temperature exposure of spinach during a shorter growth period resulted in the production of spinach with high sucrose, ascorbate, proline, gamma-aminobutyric , valine and leucine content, and these constitute the most important /nutrient sources. In conclusion, cultivation of spinach in greenhouse at a low temperature (4-7°C) and exposure for a shorter period (7-21days) before  is recommended. This strategy will produce a high quality product that people can eat.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus. The combination also inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group and Tyzzerella. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the obesity-associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of deoxycholic , cholic , 1H-indole-3-acetic , 3-indole acrylic  and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. 2-Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic , l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome. In a high sugar diet mode, theabrownin reduced the body weight and triglycerides and improved insulin resistance mainly by targeting the reproduction of intestinal microorganisms such as BA, Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, Gut_metagenome and so on. A strong correlation between cecal microorganisms and serum metabolites, obesity and insulin resistance was observed. Theabrownin has high potential in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as diabetes and obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28805864>Novel synthesis of magnetic, porous C/ZnFeO photocatalyst with enhanced activity under visible light based on the Fenton-like reaction.</a></h1><p>Magnetic visible-light-driven photocatalyst, porous C/ZnFeO (denoted as C/ZFO-CE) was fabricated via a CO-mediated ethanol route. CO-mediated ethanol route largely mitigated the solvent strength and facilitated the homogenous deposition of ZnFeO (ZFO) through the coordination of metallic cation with CO and HCO anions, which were hydrolyzed from CO and HO, thereby avoiding additional precipitant. Moreover, the HCO, CO and NO in the system acted as templates for the formation of porous C avoiding the additional organic mesoporous templates, thus reducing the synthesis cost. For the degradation of RhB and phenol, the C/ZFO-CE system in presence of minute HO exhibited remarkably improved catalytic performance compared with the systems of HO, ZFO, C/ZFO-CE, C/ZFO-E (C/ZnFeO synthesized in pure ethanol) and C/ZFO-E in the presence of minute HO. Furthermore, 2.0 mL of HO (30%) combined with C/ZFO-CE obtained the maximum degradation efficiencies of 100% for RhB within 60 min and 91% for phenol within 120 min. The high efficiency for degradation of pollutants over C/ZFO-CE catalyst in the presence of minute HO was possibly attributed to the strong  of visible light, the improved separation efficiency of the photoinduced charges and the overall ˙OH production by the "photo-Fenton" process. The existence of ˙OH during photodegradation process was evidenced via the PL-TA (photoluminescence-terephthalic ) technique, ESR spectra and trapping experiments of active species using different scavengers. Furthermore, a possible reaction mechanism involving the Fenton-like reaction for the photodegradation of pollutants is proposed based on the experimental results.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669989>Effect of Serratia sp.

This study investigated the potential of Serratia sp. K3 (K3) assisted with straw biogas residue (SBR) or leavening fertilizer (LF) on improving the Cd migration efficiency and micro-environment in soil-vetiveria zizanioides L. system. The results showed that the  soluble Cd in soil was increased by 2.83-29.79% in treatments compared with control (CK). In addition, Cd accumulation in the roots and shoots of vetiveria zizanioides were significantly enhanced by the combination of K3 and SBR/LF. Especially, the translocation factor of Cd increased by 21.53-62.37% in groups with K3 compared with the groups without K3, correspondingly. Furthermore, SBR/LF effectively changed bacterial community structure, and improved bacterial abundance. Relative abundance of functional genes related with carbohydrate//amino  metabolism were increased in groups of SBRB/LFB rhizosphere compared with CK. These results provide insight into the change of phytoremediation efficiency and soil bacterial communities in the vetiveria zizanioides rhizosphere after inoculation. This study may provide a promising method for improving phytoremediation in Cd contaminated soil.Copyright © 2019.

To study such effects, C3A liver cells exposed to palmitate were used as a model of hepatic insulin resistance. These hepatocytes displayed impaired substrate metabolism, including reduced glucose transport and free fatty  uptake. These defects included impaired insulin signaling, evident through reduced phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase/ protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) protein expression, and mitochondrial dysfunction, depicted by a lower mitochondrial respiration rate. Aspalathin was able to ameliorate these defects by correcting altered substrate metabolism, improving insulin signaling and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Activation of 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) may be a plausible mechanism by which aspalathin increases hepatic  expenditure. Overall, these results encourage further studies assessing the potential use of aspalathin as a nutraceutical to improve hepatocellular  expenditure, and reverse metabolic disease-associated complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30205336>Upgrading liquor-making wastewater into medium chain fatty : Insights into co-electron donors, key microflora, and  .</a></h1><p>Ethanol and lactate are considered suitable electron donors (EDs) for chain elongation (CE); however, their respective shortcomings still limit the substrate conversion ratio and medium chain fatty  (MCFA) production. To address this limitation, different EDs and electron acceptors (EAs) were combined to compare their CE performances, and to investigate whether the combination of ethanol and lactate could further enhance the MCFA production based on the complementary characteristics of ethanol and lactate. The results verified, for the first time, ethanol and lactate as the co-EDs formed a cooperative relationship to largely promote the conversion of substrates into MCFA. The co-EDs of ethanol and lactate stimulated the transformation of dispersive lactate-carbon flux from the competing acrylate pathway into n-heptylate. Additionally, the coexisting by-products (H and CO) from ethanol and lactate also contributed to the supererogatory MCFA generation. The key microbial taxa that distinguished the co-EDs from their single action were the preponderant species from class Negativicutes and family Ruminococcaceae. In addition, the co-EAs of acetate, n-butyrate, and n-caproate also promoted MCFA generation. Low concentration of n-caproate could be directly elongated into n-caprylate, while n-caproate concentration exceeding the toxic limit was unsuitable as an EA. This research provided a guide for substrate selection and collocation for CE technology. Chinese liquor-making wastewater (CLMW) was subsequently used as a substrate for MCFA production since it contains abundant lactate, ethanol, and short-chain fatty . In this study, a MCFA selectivity of 80.34 ± 5.26%, a slightly higher selectivity which is in the range of previously reported ones, was obtained. This study paves a way for the sustainable development of Chinese liquor industry by recycling the high-output CLMW into MCFA.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here the HBFC provides an enzymeless approach for the fabrication of the anodic electrode while employing an enzymatic approach for the fabrication of the cathodic electrode to develop  harvesting platform to power bioelectronic devices. The anode employed 250 μm braided gold wire modified with colloidal platinum (Au-co-Pt) and bilirubin oxidase (BODx) modified gold coated Buckypaper (BP-Au-BODx) cathode. The functionalization of the gold coated multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) structures of the BP electrodes is achieved by 3-mercaptopropionic  surface modification to possess negatively charged carboxylic groups and subsequently followed by EDC/Sulfo-NHS (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-Hydroxysulfosuccinimide) crosslinking with BODx. The integration of the BODx and gold coated MWCNTs is evaluated for bioelectrocatalytic activity. The Au-co-Pt and BP-Au-BODx exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards glucose oxidation with a linear dynamic range up to 20 mM glucose and molecular oxygen reduction, respectively. The HBFC demonstrated excellent performance with the largest open circuit voltages of 0.735 V and power density of 46.31 μW/cm in 3 mM glucose. In addition, the HBFC operating on 3 mM glucose exhibited excellent uninterrupted operational stability while continuously powering a small electronic device. These results provide great opportunities for implementing this simple but efficient HBFC to  the biochemical  of target fuel(s) in diverse medical and environmental applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31353729>Protective effects of a mixed plant extracts derived from Astragalus membranaceus and Laminaria japonica on PTU-induced hypothyroidism and liver damages.</a></h1><p>Protective effects of a mixed hot water extracts of Astragalus membranaceus (AWE) and Laminaria japonica (LWE), AWE: LWE 85:15 (g/g; AL mix), were investigated against propylthiouracil (PTU)-induced hypothyroidism in rats. Rats were challenged with PTU, resulting in, increased thyroid gland weight, decreased liver weight and antioxidant activities, reduced serum tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine levels with increased thyroid stimulating hormone levels, and elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase level. However, orally administered AL mix with 100, 200, and 400 mg kg  day , significantly inhibited such abnormalities, dose-dependently. Moreover, PTU-induced abnormal histological architecture of the rat thyroid gland and liver were also significantly ameliorated by an AL mix. The results suggested that, therapeutic use of AL mix for treating hypothyroidism can be characterized by its diversified active ingredients particularly iodine and ferulic  as confirmed by phytochemical analyses. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The AL mix has synergistic effects in modulating thyroid hormone synthesis and preventing liver damages in PTU-induced hypothyroid rats. These effects of AL mix are mainly related to its richness specifically in iodine and ferulic . The growing interests of iodine and ferulic  in AL mix are principally due to their beneficial effects in releasing sufficient thyroid hormones in hypothyroid conditions and promoting liver-protective functions through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potentials, respectively. Moreover, the results of AL mix are well-matched with the effects of standard drug levothyroxine in the present study. Therefore, appropriate dosage of AL mix will be promising as new medicinal food for preventing thyroid dysfunctions and its related liver damages.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27453530>Enhancement of recombination process using silver and graphene quantum dot embedded intermediate layer for efficient organic tandem cells.</a></h1><p>High performance of organic tandem solar cell is largely dependent on transparent and conductive intermediate layer (IML). The current work reports the design and fabrication of an IML using a simple solution process. The efficiency of a homo-tandem device with poly(3-hexylthiophene):phenyl-C61-butyric  methyl ester as an active layer and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)/poly(ethylenimine) as an IML was initially found to be 3.40%. Further enhancement of the cell efficiency was achieved using silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) of different sizes and graphene quantum dot embedded IML. A maximum efficiency of 4.03% was achieved using 7 nm Ag-NPs that contribute to a better recombination process. Also, the performance of the tandem cell was solely based on the electrical improvements indicated by the current - voltage measurements, external quantum efficiency and impedance analysis. The use of Ag-NPs in the IML has been shown to lengthen the life time of electron-hole pairs in the device.

Here, we report on TB-based PSCs containing two donor materials; poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) and Rhodamine B (RhB) laser organic dye, and [6,6]-phenyl C butyric  methyl ester (PCBM) as an acceptor. The influence of RhB weight percentage and injection volume was extensively studied. To gain insight into the influences of RhB on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, physicochemical and optical properties of TBs were compared with those of BHJ binary blend as a standard. RhB broadened the light absorption properties of the active layer and played a bridging role between P3HT and PCBM. The PCE and short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the optimized TB-based PSCs comprising of 0.5 wt% RhB reached 5% and 12.12 mA/cm, respectively. Compared to BHJ standard cell, the PCE and the generated current was improved by two orders of magnitude due to higher photon  of the active layer, cascade  level structure of TB components and a considerable decrease in the charge carrier recombination. The results suggest that RhB can be considered as an effective material for application in PSCs to attain high photovoltaic performance.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Pasture-based systems are widely used for dairy production in certain areas of the world, but prediction equations of fresh grass nutritive value (nutrient digestibility and  concentrations) are limited. Equations to predict digestible  (DE) and metabolizable  (ME) used for grazing cattle have been either developed with cattle fed conserved forage and concentrate diets or sheep fed previously frozen grass, and the majority of them require measurements less commonly available to producers, such as nutrient digestibility. The aim of the present study was therefore to develop prediction equations more suitable to grazing cattle for nutrient digestibility and  concentrations, which are routinely available at farm level by using grass nutrient contents as predictors. A study with 33 nonpregnant, nonlactating cows fed solely fresh-cut grass at maintenance  level for 50 wk was carried out over 3 consecutive grazing seasons. Freshly harvested grass of 3 cuts (primary growth and first and second regrowth), 9 fertilizer input levels, and contrasting stage of maturity (3 to 9 wk after ) was used, thus ensuring a wide representation of nutritional quality. As a result, a large variation existed in digestibility of dry matter (0.642-0.900) and digestible organic matter in dry matter (0.636-0.851) and in concentrations of DE (11.8-16.7 MJ/kg of dry matter) and ME (9.0-14.1 MJ/kg of dry matter). Nutrient digestibilities and DE and ME concentrations were negatively related to grass neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and  detergent fiber (ADF) contents but positively related to nitrogen (N), gross , and ether extract (EE) contents. For each predicted variable (nutrient digestibilities or  concentrations), different combinations of predictors (grass chemical composition) were found to be significant and increase the explained variation. For example, relatively higher R(2) values were found for prediction of N digestibility using N and EE as predictors; gross- digestibility using EE, NDF, ADF, and ash; NDF, ADF, and organic matter digestibilities using N, water-soluble carbohydrates, EE, and NDF; digestible organic matter in dry matter using water-soluble carbohydrates, EE, NDF, and ADF; DE concentration using gross , EE, NDF, ADF, and ash; and ME concentration using N, EE, ADF, and ash. Equations presented may allow a relatively quick and easy prediction of grass quality and, hence, better grazing utilization on commercial and research farms, where nutrient composition falls within the range assessed in the current study.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

Treatments to increase dry matter content of the kelp  were recently described by the authors. However macroalgae are an extremely diverse group of organisms and compositional variation between species may influence the effects of particular treatments. In this study, potential dewatering treatments including drying, osmotic media, and the application of both organic and mineral  all followed by screw-pressing have been tested on two other species of kelp ( and ) and a red seaweed (). Conditions that dewatered these species were identified and the data have been combined with the previous results for .

Plasma acetate, propionate, and butyrate were associated with body mass index and visceral and SC fat (all P < .05) and with hepatic DNL (P = .01, P = .09, P = .04, respectively). Moreover, the rate of CHO fermentation from the gut flora was higher in obese than in lean subjects (P = .018).These data demonstrate that obese youth show a different gut flora composition than lean and that short chain fatty  are associated with body fat partitioning and DNL.

Summer water temperatures can average over 19 °C over several weeks and have negative effects on performance and health. Liver tissue exerts important metabolic functions in thermal adaptation. With the aim of identifying mechanisms underlying liver plasticity in response to chronic elevated temperature in Atlantic salmon, label-free shotgun proteomics was used to explore quantitative protein changes after 43 days of exposure to elevated temperature.A total of 276 proteins were differentially (adjusted p-value < 0.05) expressed between the control (15 °C) and elevated (21 °C) temperature treatments. As identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), transcription and translation mechanisms, protein degradation via the proteasome, and cytoskeletal components were down-regulated at elevated temperature. In contrast, an up-regulated response was identified for NRF2-mediated oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and amino  degradation. The proteome response was paralleled by reduced fish condition factor and hepato-somatic index at elevated temperature.The present study provides new evidence of the interplay among different cellular machineries in a scenario of heat-induced  deficit and oxidative stress, and refines present understanding of how Atlantic salmon cope with chronic exposure to temperature near the upper limits of thermal tolerance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27720148>Changes in the intestinal bacterial community, short-chain fatty  profile, and intestinal development of preweaned Holstein calves. 2.

Thirty-two calves were fed at 2% of their body weight (dry matter basis) from d 10 until . Sixteen calves were euthanized at 2wk and another 16 at 4wk of age to collect digesta samples from the rumen and colon. The rumen and colon bacterial communities of preruminant calves showed a similar degree of diversity (i.e., Shannon index) whereas composition differed considerably. The colonic bacterial population was characterized by dominance of lactic  bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Bifidobacterium. In addition, colonic short-chain fatty  and lactic  concentrations were between 50 and 850% higher than in the rumen, indicating greater fermentative activity in the colon. On the other hand, in the rumen, no genus over-dominated and more variation was present among calves. Because of an active reticular groove and low starter grain intake during the first 1 to 3wk of life, ruminal fermentation may not contribute to significant metabolizable  supply until after 4wk of life in intensively fed calves. Until then, calf hindgut fermentation, characterized by high abundance of lactic  bacteria along with increased lactate and butyrate concentrations, could be beneficial for intestinal health and survival of the calf during the first weeks of life.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

These metabolic pathways are integrated by a key cytoplasmic organelle, the mitochondria, leading to production of many metabolic intermediates and  cellular  in the form of ATP. Sirtuins are a highly conserved family of proteins that mediate cellular physiology and  demands in response to metabolic inputs. Mitochondria inhabit three main types of sirtuins classified as Sirt3, Sirt4 and Sirt5. These sirtuins regulate mitochondrial metabolic functions mainly through controlling post-translational modifications of mitochondrial protein. However, the biological mechanism involved in controlling mitochondrial metabolic functions is not well understood at this stage. In this review the current knowledge on how mitochondrial sirtuins govern mitochondrial functions including  production, metabolism, biogenesis and their involvement in different metabolic pathways are discussed. The identifications of potential pharmacological targets of sirtuins in the mitochondria and the bioactive compounds that target mitochondrial sirtuins will increase our understanding on regulation of mitochondrial metabolism in normal and disease state.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we emphasize the fabrication of a triboelectric driven self-charging and self-healing asymmetric supercapacitor (SCSHASC) power cell composed of magnetic cobalt ferrite grown on a stainless steel (SS) fabric (CoFeO@SS) as positive and iron oxides decorated reduced graphene oxide grown on a SS fabric (Fe-RGO@SS) as negative electrodes separated by a KOH-soaked self-healing polymer hydrogel electrolyte membrane. The membrane contains Fe cross-linked polyacrylic , whereas self-healing carboxylated polyurethane was utilized for encapsulation. SS fabric and poly(vinylidene fluoride- co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP)/SS-impregnated micropatterned PDMS composite film-strip were employed as positive and negative triboelectric friction layers, respectively. During mechanical deformation, the SCSHASC harvests electrical  and subsequently stores it as electrochemical  for sustainable power supply. The sandwich-type SCSHASC power cell (a supercapacitor unit sandwiched between two parallelly connected high-performance triboelectric nanogenerators) was charged up to ∼1.6 V within ∼31 min under periodic compression/stress ( F ≈ 17.6 N, f ≈ 3.80 Hz). Furthermore, the SCSHASC# (with two supercapacitor units in series) can instantly power-up several portable electronic appliances on periodic compression and release. Thus, the SCSHASC with unique design will be extremely beneficial for self-powered electronics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29496274>Gut microbiota alterations and dietary modulation in childhood malnutrition - The role of short chain fatty .</a></h1><p>The gut microbiome affects the health status of the host through different mechanisms and is associated with a wide variety of diseases. Both childhood undernutrition and obesity are linked to alterations in composition and functionality of the gut microbiome. One of the possible mechanisms underlying the interplay between microbiota and host metabolism is through appetite-regulating hormones (including leptin, ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide-1). Short chain fatty , the end product of bacterial fermentation of non-digestible carbohydrates, might be able to alter   and metabolism through enteroendocrine cell signaling, adipogenesis and insulin-like growth factor-1 production. Elucidating these mechanisms may lead to development of new modulation practices of the gut microbiota as a potential prevention and treatment strategy for childhood malnutrition. The present overview will briefly outline the gut microbiota development in the early life, gut microbiota alterations in childhood undernutrition and obesity, and whether this relationship is causal. Further we will discuss possible underlying mechanisms in relation to the gut-brain axis and short chain fatty , and the potential of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics for modulating the gut microbiota during childhood as a prevention and treatment strategy against undernutrition and obesity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

The shelf life is only 4-6days under ambient temperature storage conditions, which has restricted the development of the litchi industry to a considerable extent. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of litchi fruit senescence, comparative proteomic analysis was carried out on litchi pulp. After two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), 64 spots were significantly differentially expressed, 61 of which were successfully identified using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). All of the identified proteins were classified according to biological process, molecular function, and cellular component using Blast2GO. Results showed that those proteins were mainly involved in signal transduction, cell wall metabolism, primary and secondary metabolism,  metabolism. Specifically, many up-regulated proteins were involved in auxin/ethylene regulation, which suggested that auxin and ethylene might cooperate to regulate litchi pulp senescence. Histone deacetylase and DNA methyltransferase might involve the down-regulation of proteins related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, glycolysis, tricarboxylic  cycle, and ATP synthesis in litchi senescence. A higher proportion of differentially expressed proteins were up-regulated and these were involved in a range of processes including cell wall organization or biogenesis, anaerobic respiration, protein degradation, lipid degradation. All of those proteins might accelerate fruit softening, deterioration and senescence. This study is the first to carry out proteomic analysis of the regulation of litchi fruit senescence.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Lymphocytes make up the majority of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are readily obtainable, providing an ideal sample to monitor systemic changes and understand molecular signaling mechanisms in disease processes. Mitochondrial  metabolism of lymphocyte has been used to screen for OXPHOS disorders. While there are increasing studies of lymphocyte OXPHOS, few studies examined activity of electron transport chain of lymphocyte mitochondria. We present an optimal protocol to  fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells from human whole blood, determine integrated mitochondrial function, and analyze electron transport chain complex activity. Analyzing integrated mitochondrial function using OXPHOS provides data to uncover defects in the transport of substrates into the mitochondria, generation of reducing equivalents, the electron transport chain, and coupling to the production of adenosine triphosphate. The optimal conditions to  peripheral blood mononuclear cells were using blood anticoagulated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic , processed utilizing Lymphoprep™, and washed in phosphate buffered saline, all at room temperature.

Two wheat varieties (Shi and Zhong) were harvested in 2013 and stored in the warehouse of the Fengning Pig Experimental Base at China Agricultural University for 3, 6, 9, or 12 mo. For each storage period, 12 barrows were placed in metabolism crates and allotted to diets containing 1 of the 2 wheat varieties in a randomized complete block design. The experimental diets contained 97.34% wheat and 2.66% of a vitamin and trace mineral premix. With an extension of storage duration from 3 mo to 12 mo, the gross  (GE) and crude protein (CP) of the wheat decreased by 2.0% and 12.01%, respectively, while the concentration of neutral detergent fiber (NDF),  detergent fiber (ADF) and starch content increased by 30.26%, 19.08%, and 2.46%, respectively. Total non-starch polysaccharide, total arabinose, total xylose and total mannose contents decreased by 46.27%, 45.80%, 41.71%, and 75.66%, respectively. However, there were no significant differences in the chemical composition between the two wheat varieties with the exception of ADF which was approximately 13.37% lower in Shi. With an extension of storage duration from 3 mo to 12 mo, the digestible  (DE), metabolizable  (ME) content and the apparent total tract digestibility of GE, CP, dry matter, organic matter, ether extract, ADF and metabolizability of  in wheat decreased linearly (p<0.01) by 5.74%, 7.60%, 3.75%, 3.88%, 3.50%, 2.47%, 26.22%, 27.62%, and 3.94%, respectively. But the digestibility of NDF changed quadratically (p<0.01). There was an interaction between wheat variety and storage time for CP digestibility (p<0.05), such that the CP digestibility of variety Zhong was stable during 9 mo of storage, while the CP digestibility of variety Shi decreased (p<0.05). In conclusion, the GE, DE, and ME of wheat was stable during the first 3 to 6 mo of post- storage, and decreased during the following 6 to 12 mo of storage under the conditions of this study.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25846719>Gut microbiome composition and metabolomic profiles of wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) reflect host ecology.</a></h1><p>The metabolic activities of gut microbes significantly influence host physiology; thus, characterizing the forces that modulate this micro-ecosystem is key to understanding mammalian biology and fitness. To investigate the gut microbiome of wild primates and determine how these microbial communities respond to the host's external environment, we characterized faecal bacterial communities and, for the first time, gut metabolomes of four wild lowland gorilla groups in the Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic. Results show that geographical range may be an important modulator of the gut microbiomes and metabolomes of these gorilla groups. Distinctions seemed to relate to feeding behaviour, implying   through increased fruit consumption or fermentation of highly fibrous foods. These observations were supported by differential abundance of metabolites and bacterial taxa associated with the metabolism of cellulose, phenolics, organic , simple sugars, lipids and sterols between gorillas occupying different geographical ranges. Additionally, the gut microbiomes of a gorilla group under increased anthropogenic pressure could always be distinguished from that of all other groups. By characterizing the interplay between environment, behaviour, diet and symbiotic gut microbes, we present an alternative perspective on primate ecology and on the forces that shape the gut microbiomes of wild primates from an evolutionary context.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26253914>Ensiling of seaweed for a seaweed biofuel industry.</a></h1><p>Effective biogas production from seaweed necessitates  at times of peak quality of biomass and low-loss preservation for year-around supply. Ensiling of five seaweed species and storage up to 90days was investigated as a method to preserve the methane yield potential. Adequate acidification by natural lactic  fermentation was difficult due to low rapidly fermentable carbohydrate contents, high buffering capacities and low initial numbers of lactic  bacteria. Nevertheless, products of silage fermentation increased methane yields by up to 28% and compensated for volatile solid losses during ensiling. Preservation of the original methane yield potential was achieved for four of five seaweed species, provided that silage effluent is collected and utilised. 10-28% of the ensiled biomass was released as effluent with methane yields of 218-423LNkg(-1) VS. If further optimised, ensiling represents an effective method of preservation crucial for an efficient seaweed biofuel industry.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Whole-plant corn was harvested at a very early [25% dry matter (DM); CS25], early (28% DM; CS28), medium (32% DM; CS32), and late (40% DM; CS40) stage of maturity. In a randomized block design, 28 lactating Holstein-Friesian dairy cows, of which 8 were fitted with rumen cannula, received 1 of 4 dietary treatments designated as T25, T28, T32, and T40 to reflect the DM contents at . Treatments consisted of (DM basis) 75% CS, 20% concentrate, and 5% wheat straw. Feed intake, digestibility, milk production and composition,  and N balance, and CH4 production were measured during a 5-d period in climate respiration chambers after an adaptation to the diet for 12 d. Corn silage starch content varied between 275 (CS25) and 385 (CS40) g/kg of DM. Treatments did not affect DM intake (DMI), milk yield, or milk contents. In situ ruminal fractional degradation rate of starch decreased linearly from 0.098 to 0.059/h as maturity increased from CS25 to CS40. Apparent total-tract digestibility of DM, organic matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, crude fat, starch, and gross  (GE) decreased linearly with maturity. Treatments did not affect ruminal pH, volatile fatty , and ammonia concentrations, and volatile fatty  molar proportions. The concentration of C18:3n-3 in milk fat decreased linearly, and the concentration of C18:2n-6 and the n-6:n-3 ratio increased linearly with maturity. A quadratic response occurred for the total saturated fatty  concentration and total monounsaturated fatty  concentration in milk fat. Methane production relative to DMI (21.7, 23.0, 21.0, and 20.1g/kg) and relative to GE intake (0.063, 0.067, 0.063, and 0.060 MJ/MJ; values for T25, T28, T32, and T40, respectively) decreased linearly with maturity. Also, CH4 emission relative to fat- and protein-corrected milk tended to decrease linearly with maturity (13.0, 13.4, 13.2, and 12.1g/kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk, for T25, T28, T32, and T40, respectively). Intake of GE and metabolizable , and  retained, all expressed per unit of metabolic body weight, did not differ among treatments. Nitrogen intake, N use efficiency (milk N/N intake), and N balance were not influenced by treatments. Increasing maturity of whole-plant corn at  may offer an effective strategy to decrease CH4 losses with feeding CS without negatively affecting cow performance.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

To determine the effects of replacing corn in a finishing diet with ALG on growth, mineral status, carcass characteristics, and longissimus thoracis fatty  profile, crossbred steers (168) were blocked by BW (432 ± 30.8 kg) into pens of 6 steers (7 pens per treatment). Pens received 1 of 4 diets: a corn-based control (CON), 14% ALG, 28% ALG (ALG28), and 42% ALG (ALG42). Corn was replaced by ALG on a DM basis. Steer BW were taken on d 0, 1, 28, 56, 74, 101, and 102, and steers were harvested on d 103. Pen was the experimental unit and DMI, ADG, and G:F data were analyzed as repeated measures. Two steers per pen were selected for sampling of blood and liver (d -1 and 96) and collection of rib steaks at . There was a treatment by × time effect ( = 0.10) for overall DMI, where DMI linearly increased ( ≤ 0.008) across all time periods except Day 28 through, 56 when DMI was not different between ALG28 and ALG42. There was a treatment by time effect for ADG ( < 0.01), with ADG linearly decreasing ( ≤ 0.03) in the first and third month, not differing ( = 0.95) in the second month, and linearly increasing ( < 0.01) in the fourth month as ALG increased in the diet. Final BW and HCW did not differ ( ≥ 0.50) between CON- and ALG-fed cattle. There was a treatment × time effect for G:F ( < 0.01), with G:F linearly decreasing ( ≤ 0.01) in the first 3 mo as ALG increased in the diet, whereas G:F linearly increased ( < 0.01) in the fourth month. Based on steer performance, calculated dietary NEg linearly decreased ( < 0.01) as ALG increased in the diet. Yield grade linearly decreased ( = 0.02) and there was a tendency for dressing percent and 12th-rib back fat to linearly decrease ( ≤ 0.10) as ALG increased in the diet. Plasma Cu, Fe, and Mg concentrations were not different ( ≥ 0.31) in CON vs. ALG cattle; however, plasma Zn concentrations linearly increased ( = 0.03) as ALG increased in the diet. Total lipid, SFA, MUFA, and PUFA concentrations in the longissimus thoracis did not differ ( ≥ 0.13) between CON- and ALG-fed cattle. Interestingly, the atherogenic index linearly decreased ( < 0.01) as ALG increased in the diet. Algae meal may have a lesser  value than corn; however, a minimal effect on carcass performance suggests ALG may serve as a potential replacement for corn in feedlot diets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29879832>Potential of four corn varieties at different  stages for silage production in Malaysia.</a></h1><p>Apart from various climatic differences, corn  stage and varieties are two major factors that can influence the yield and quality of corn silage in the tropics. A study was conducted to determine the optimum  stage of four corn varieties for silage production in Malaysia.Corn was harvested at four growth stages; silking, milk, dough, and dent stages from four varieties; Sweet Corn hybrid 926, Suwan, breeding test line (BTL) 1 and BTL 2. Using a split plot design, the treatments were then analysed based on the plant growth performance, yield, nutritive and feeding values followed by a financial feasibility study for potential commercialization.Significant differences and interactions were detected across the parameters suggesting varying responses among the varieties towards the  stages. Sweet Corn was best harvested early in the dough stage due to high dry matter (DM) yield, digestible nutrient, and  content with low fibre portion. Suwan was recommended to be harvested at the dent stage when it gave the highest DM yield with optimum digestible nutrient and  content with low  detergent fibre. BTL 1 and BTL 2 varieties can either be harvested at dough or dent stages as the crude protein, crude fibre, DM yield, DM content, digestible nutrient and  were not significantly different at either stage. Further financial analysis showed that only Sweet Corn production was not financially feasible while Suwan had the best financial appraisal values among the grain varieties.In conclusion, only the grain varieties tested had the potential for silage making according to their optimum  stage but Suwan is highly recommended for commercialization as it was the most profitable.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25906472>Processed vs. non-processed biowastes for agriculture: effects of post- tomato plants and biochar on radish growth, chlorophyll content and protein production.</a></h1><p>The aim of this work was to address the issue of processed vs. non-processed biowastes for agriculture, by comparing materials widely differing for the amount of process  consumption. Thus, residual post  tomato plants (TP), the TP hydrolysates obtained at pH 13 and 60 °C, and two known biochar products obtained by 650 °C pyrolysis were prepared. All products were characterized and used in a cultivation of radish plants. The chemical composition and molecular nature of the materials was investigated by solid state 13C NMR spectrometry, elemental analysis and potentiometric titration. The plants were analysed for growth and content of chlorophyll, carotenoids and soluble proteins. The results show that the TP and the alkaline hydrolysates contain lignin, hemicellulose, protein, peptide and/or amino  moieties, and several mineral elements. The biochar samples contain also similar mineral elements, but the organic fraction is characterized mainly by fused aromatic rings. All materials had a positive effect on radish growth, mainly on the diameter of roots. The best performances in terms of plant growth were given by miscanthus originated biochar and TP. The most significant effect was the enhancement of soluble protein content in the plants treated with the lowest  consumption non processed TP.

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), a surgical intervention for obesity, is classified as predominantly restrictive procedure. In this study we investigated functional weight loss mechanisms with regard to gut microbial changes and   induced by LSG and a very low calorie diet in ten obese subjects (n = 5 per group) demonstrating identical weight loss during a follow-up period of six months. For gut microbiome analysis next generation sequencing was performed and faeces were analyzed for targeted metabolomics. The -reabsorbing potential of the gut microbiota decreased following LSG, indicated by the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio, but increased during diet. Changes in butyrate-producing bacterial species were responsible for the Firmicutes changes in both groups. No alteration of faecal butyrate was observed, but the microbial capacity for butyrate fermentation decreased following LSG and increased following dietetic intervention. LSG resulted in enhanced faecal excretion of nonesterified fatty  and bile . LSG, but not dietetic restriction, improved the obesity-associated gut microbiota composition towards a lean microbiome phenotype. Moreover, LSG increased malabsorption due to loss in -rich faecal substrates and impairment of bile  circulation.

In addition, wood-ash is beneficial to many soils due to its inherent -neutralizing capabilities. However, wood ash has several ecosystem-perturbing effects like increased soil pH and pore water electrical conductivity both known to strongly impact soil bacterial numbers and community composition. Studies investigating soil bacterial community responses to wood ash application remain sparse and the available results are ambiguous and remain at a general taxonomic level. Here we investigate the response of bacterial communities in a spruce forest soil to wood ash addition corresponding to 0, 5, 22, and 167 t wood ash ha. We used culture-based enumerations of general bacteria,  and sporeforming bacteria combined with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to valuate soil bacterial responses to wood ash application. Results showed that wood ash addition strongly increased soil pH and electrical conductivity. Soil pH increased from acidic through neutral at 22 t ha to alkaline at 167 t ha. Bacterial numbers significantly increased up to a wood ash dose of 22 t ha followed by significant decrease at 167 t ha wood ash. The soil bacterial community composition changed after wood ash application with copiotrophic bacteria responding positively up to a wood ash dose of 22 t ha while the adverse effect was seen for oligotrophic bacteria. Marked changes in bacterial community composition occurred at a wood ash dose of 167 t ha with a single alkaliphilic genus dominating. Additionally, spore-formers became abundant at an ash dose of 167 t ha whereas this was not the case at lower ash doses. Lastly, bacterial richness and diversity strongly decreased with increasing amount of wood ash applied. All of the observed bacterial responses can be directly explained by the wood ash induced changes in pH, electrical conductivity and the addition of wood ash inherent nutrients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29957105>Altered Gut Microbiota: A Link Between Diet and the Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h1><p>Diet with increased intake of -rich foods has long been implicated in the etiology of metabolic syndrome.

In the present study, the effect of cyanidin-3-sophoroside (CS) from Garcinia mangostana rind, on polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity was investigated. The non-competitive inhibition mode of CS was determined by Lineweaver Burk plot. CS forms a ground-state complex by quenching the intrinsic fluorescence of PPO. The static quenching was temperature-dependent with an activation  of 4.654±0.1091kJmol to withstand the disruption of amino  residues of the enzyme binding site. The enzyme conformational change was validated by 3D fluorescence and CD spectrum. Docking (binding  -8.124kcal/mol) and simulation studies confirmed the binding pattern and stability. CS decreased PPO activity and browning index of fresh cut apples and prolonged the shelf life. Thus, CS appears to be a promising anti-browning agent to control enzymatic browning.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Proline metabolism is manipulated under stress by multiple and complex regulatory pathways and can profoundly influence cell death and survival in microorganisms, plants, and animals. Though the effects of proline are mediated by diverse signaling pathways, a common theme appears to be the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to proline oxidation being coupled to the respiratory electron transport chain. Considerable research has been devoted to understand how plants exploit proline metabolism in response to abiotic and biotic stress. Here, we review potential mechanisms by which proline metabolism influences plant senescence, namely in the petal and leaf. Recent studies of petal senescence suggest proline content is manipulated to meet  demands of senescing cells. In the flower and leaf, proline metabolism may influence ROS signaling pathways that delay senescence progression.

Studies using mice made obese with refined high-fat diets have supported this; however, these have commonly used chow as a control diet, introducing confounding factors from differences in dietary composition that have a key role in shaping microbiota composition. We compared the effects of feeding a refined high-fat diet with those of feeding either a refined low-fat diet or a chow diet on gut microbiota composition and host physiology. Feeding both refined low- or high-fat diets resulted in large alterations in the gut microbiota composition, intestinal fermentation, and gut morphology, compared to a chow diet. However, body weight, body fat, and glucose intolerance only increased in mice fed the refined high-fat diet. The choice of control diet can dissociate broad changes in microbiota composition from obesity, raising questions about the previously proposed relationship between gut microbiota and obesity.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Yet, the cultivar with the most optimal nutrient content and the preferred  times are as yet unknown. For this reason, mucilage from three  (Algerian, Morado and Gymno-Carpo) and one  (Robusta) cultivar were investigated to determine their nutrient content over six months. Nutrients that contribute  (10.2 kJ/g) were low. The mineral content was high (ash 17.7/100 g), particularly calcium (3.0 g/100 g) and phosphorous (109.5 mg/kg). Low insoluble -detergent fibre (1.4 g/kg) and neutral-detergent fibre (2.1 g/kg) values indicated that mucilage was mostly soluble fibre. Calcium oxalate crystals were not detected in dried mucilage.  powders had higher protein, extractable fat and potassium content, while  mucilage powders had higher polyunsaturated (Linoleic and α-Linolenic ) fat content.  Robusta mucilage, harvested after the fruit  (February) had the lowest  content and the highest mineral and protein content. Mucilage powders were highly soluble, low-kilojoule and mineral-rich.

The development of a stable and diverse gut microbiota is essential to various host physiologic functions such as immunoregulation, pathogen prevention,  , and metabolism. At the same time, a dysbiotic gut microbiota associated with disease is altered in structure and function, and often characterized by a decrease in species richness and proliferation of pathogenic bacterial taxa. As a shared substrate between the host and the gut microbiota, diet significantly impacts the health and disease states of the host both directly and through gut microbial metabolite production. This is demonstrated in the examples of short-chain fatty  and trimethylamine production via bacterial metabolism of dietary complex carbohydrates and choline, respectively. In disorders related to mucosal immune dysregulation such as inflammatory bowel disease, the dysbiotic gut microbiota and diet contribute to its pathogenesis. Reversal of dysbiosis through fecal microbiota transplantation and dietary interventions may thus represent important strategies to modify the gut microbiota and its metabolite production for health maintenance as well as disease prevention and management.© 2017 Nestec Ltd., Vevey/S.

Photosynthetic parameters were measured in the regrown leaves on days 3 and 11, and regrowth biomass was recorded on day 11. Under optimal growth temperature (20°C), vegetative regrowth upon defoliation was significantly enhanced when more stubble tissue remained. However, this advantage was not observed under heat stress. Defoliation generally decreases the abundance of carbohydrate reserves in stubble. Interestingly, high temperature stimulated the accumulation of starch and ethanol-soluble carbohydrates in plants cut to 7.5 cm. The similar trends were also observed in protein, amino , nitrate, and ammonium. These responses were not pronounced in plants cut to 2.5 cm, presumably due to inhibited photosynthesis and photosystem II photochemistry. Overall, we anticipated that heat-activated metabolite accumulation is part of adaptive response to the stress. However, modified allocation of carbohydrate and nitrogen reserves leads to reduced vegetative regrowth upon defoliation. These data suggest that cutting height management for orchardgrass may be more effective for its regrowth vigor and productivity in cool seasons or when cool weather follows hay .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26733439>Bioflocculation of the oceanic microalga Dunaliella salina by the bloom-forming dinoflagellate Heterocapsa circularisquama, and its effect on biodiesel properties of the biomass.</a></h1><p>The aim of this work was to evaluate the flocculation by the dinoflagellate Heterocapsa circularisquama as a means for harvesting three Chlorophyta species, Chlorella vulgaris, Nannochloropsis granulata, and Dunaliella salina. Relative fluorescence of D. salina culture significantly decreased along with 9.3-fold increased flocculation activity within 24 h when mixed with H. circularisquama. Lipid content of bioflocculated D. salina increased about 40%, while fatty  methyl ester (FAME) profiles exhibited higher levels of C16:0, C18:0, and C18:1, compared to  by centrifugation, suggesting higher  content. Furthermore, bioflocculated D. salina biomass had more suitable biodiesel properties relative to both EN14214 and ASTMD6751, with a cetane number of 49.0 and an iodine value of 95.9. These results suggest that H. circularisquama-induced bioflocculation is applicable for the sustainable and qualitative production of algal biodiesel.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The concept of architectonics has been adapted to advance the field of molecular self-assembly and termed as molecular architectonics. In essence, the methodology of organizing molecular units in the required and controlled configurations to develop advanced functional systems for materials and biological applications comprises the field of molecular architectonics. This concept of designing noncovalent systems enables to focus on different functional aspects of designer molecules for biological and nonbiological applications and also strengthens our efforts toward the mastery over the art of controlled molecular self-assemblies. Programming complex molecular interactions and assemblies for specific functions has been one of the most challenging tasks in the modern era. Meticulously ordered molecular assemblies can impart remarkable developments in several areas spanning , health, and environment. For example, the well-defined nano-, micro-, and macroarchitectures of functional molecules with specific molecular ordering possess potential applications in flexible electronics, photovoltaics, photonic crystals, microreactors, sensors, drug delivery, biomedicine, and superhydrophobic coatings, among others. The functional molecular architectures having unparalleled properties are widely evident in various designs of Nature. By drawing inspirations from Nature, intended molecular architectures can be designed and developed to  various functions, as there is an inexhaustible resource and scope. In this Account, we present exquisite designer molecules developed by our group and others with an objective to master the art of molecular recognition and self-assembly for functional applications. We demonstrate the tailor-ability of molecular self-assemblies by employing biomolecules like amino  and nucleobases as auxiliaries. Naphthalenediimide (NDI), perylenediimide (PDI), and few other molecular systems serve as functional modules. The effects of stereochemistry and minute structural modifications in the molecular designs on the supramolecular interactions, and construction of self-assembled zero-dimensional (OD), one-dimensional (1D), and two-dimensional (2D) nano- and microarchitectures like particles, spheres, cups, bowls, fibers, belts, helical belts, supercoiled helices, sheets, fractals, and honeycomb-like arrays are discussed in extensive detail. Additionally, we present molecular systems that showcase the elegant designs of coassembly, templated assembly, hierarchical assembly, transient self-assembly, chiral denaturation, retentive helical memory, self-replication, supramolecular regulation, supramolecular speciation, supernon linearity, dynamic pathway complexity, supramolecular heterojunction, living supramolecular polymerization, and molecular machines. Finally, we describe the molecular engineering principles learnt over the years that have led to several applications, namely, organic electronics, self-cleaning, high-mechanical strength, and tissue engineering.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26596773>Energyless CO2 Absorption, Generation, and Fixation Using Atmospheric CO2.</a></h1><p>From an economic and ecological perspective, the efficient utilization of atmospheric CO2 as a carbon resource should be a much more important goal than reducing CO2 emissions. However, no strategy to  CO2 using atmospheric CO2 at room temperature currently exists, which is presumably due to the extremely low concentration of CO2 in ambient air (approximately 400 ppm=0.04 vol%). We discovered that monoethanolamine (MEA) and its derivatives efficiently absorbed atmospheric CO2 without requiring an  source. We also found that the absorbed CO2 could be easily liberated with .

However, the precise contribution of microbes to host  balance during undernutrition is unclear. Here, we show that Issatchenkia orientalis, a fungal microbe isolated from field-caught Drosophila melanogaster, promotes amino   to rescue the lifespan of undernourished flies. Using radioisotope-labeled dietary components (amino , nucleotides, and sucrose) to quantify nutrient transfer from food to microbe to fly, we demonstrate that I. orientalis extracts amino  directly from nutrient-poor diets and increases protein flux to the fly. This microbial association restores body mass, protein, glycerol, and ATP levels and phenocopies the metabolic profile of adequately fed flies. Our study uncovers amino   as a fundamental mechanism linking microbial and host metabolism, and highlights Drosophila as a platform for quantitative studies of host-microbe relationships.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of feeding minimally refined cottonseed oil or crude glycerol on growth performance, carcass composition, and fat quality of growing-finishing pigs. Mixed sex pigs ( = 216; 24 ± 4 kg initial BW) were blocked by BW and allotted to 1 of 3 dietary treatments: 1) a basal corn-soybean meal diet with 40% DDGS (CON), 2) CON diet plus 5% minimally refined cottonseed oil added throughout the experiment (COT), or 3) CON fed during the first 8 wk and CON + 8% crude glycerol fed during the last 6 wk of the experiment (GLY). Although diets were not isocaloric, total AA-to-ME ratios were calculated to be equal among diets. Carcass composition was estimated using real-time ultrasound 2 d before . Gilts (16/treatment) closest to the mean BW of each pen were harvested (115 ± 8 kg BW), and bellies were retrieved for in-depth analysis of fat quality. Belly fat was sampled and analyzed for fatty  composition. Overall, ADFI of pigs fed COT (2.30 kg/d) was less ( < 0.01) than that of pigs fed CON or GLY (2.47 and 2.49 kg/d, respectively). Pigs fed COT (0.93 kg/d) had greater ( < 0.01) ADG compared with pigs fed CON or GLY (0.88 and 0.87 kg/d, respectively). Greater ( < 0.01) G:F was observed for pigs fed COT (0.41) than for pigs fed CON or GLY diets (0.36 and 0.35, respectively). Final BW of pigs fed COT (124.3 kg) was greater ( < 0.01) than that of pigs fed CON or GLY (118.9 and 118.6 kg, respectively). Pigs fed COT had greater ( < 0.01) HCW (94.9 kg) compared with pigs fed CON or GLY (89.9 and 89.2 kg, respectively). No differences were observed for dressing percentage (75.7, 76.3, and 75.3%), fat-free carcass lean percentage (50.5, 49.7, and 50.0%), and belly flop angle (6.21, 8.57, and 6.06°) for CON, COT, and GLY, respectively. Pigs assigned to COT had higher ( < 0.01) melting point of belly fat compared with pigs assigned to CON or GLY (30.4 vs. 26.3 and 25.3°C, respectively). Pigs fed COT had increased ( < 0.05) SFA, PUFA, and iodine value (IV) compared with CON-fed pigs. Glycerol supplementation had no influence on SFA, MUFA, and PUFA concentrations or IV of belly, jowl, and back fat compared with CON. In conclusion, COT diets improved growth performance due to greater  density, but carcass composition was not affected by treatments. In this experiment, feeding neither COT nor GLY improved fat firmness of pigs fed diets containing 40% DDGS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27105827>Pathophysiological role of host microbiota in the development of obesity.</a></h1><p>Overweight and obesity increase the risk for a number of diseases, namely, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, premature death, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease as well as different types of cancer. Approximately 1.7 billion people in the world suffer from being overweight, most notably in developed countries. Current research efforts have focused on host and environmental factors that may affect  balance. It was hypothesized that a microbiota profile specific to an obese host with increased -yielding behavior may exist. Consequently, the gut microbiota is becoming of significant research interest in relation to obesity in an attempt to better understand the aetiology of obesity and to develop new methods of its prevention and treatment. Alteration of microbiota composition may stimulate development of obesity and other metabolic diseases via several mechanisms: increasing gut permeability with subsequent metabolic inflammation; increasing   from the diet; impairing short-chain fatty  synthesis; and altering bile  metabolism and FXR/TGR5 signaling. Prebiotics and probiotics have physiologic functions that contribute to the health of gut microbiota, maintenance of a healthy body weight and control of factors associated with obesity through their effects on mechanisms that control food intake, body weight, gut microbiota and inflammatory processes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29762384>Microbial Metabolism in the Mammalian Gut: Molecular Mechanisms and Clinical Implications.</a></h1><p>Human intestinal microbes participate actively at the interface of diet, nutrition, and overall health status. These biodiverse communities of microorganisms have a broader metabolic repertoire compared with their host, and they are able to synthesize and degrade substrates that would be otherwise unavailable. In recent years, we have recognized that healthy microbial communities are important for   and the regulation of body systems outside the digestive tract. Microbial dysbiosis, however, has been implicated in a number of human disorders, including obesity and inflammation. This dichotomy highlights the need to understand the factors that determine the composition and metabolic output of our resident and transient microbes. Throughout the human lifespan, we know that diet plays a major role in shaping gut microbial communities, as well as directing the types and amounts of metabolites produced. Understanding the factors that affect microbial metabolic output within the host may help identify the roles of microbes in health, as well as new targets for treatment in disease. In this article, we review facets of the assembly and activities of the healthy human intestinal microbiome, as well as ways that the microbiota has been shown to influence the host via metabolism of two dietary macronutrients: carbohydrates and amino .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30487562>Importance of gut microbiota in obesity.</a></h1><p>Recently, a number of studies have related the development of highly prevalent disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity to gut microbiota.

Following 10 weeks of tumor growth, all animals were sacrificed to collect total white adipose tissue (WAT). Luminex assays were performed for gut hormone and inflammation marker analysis. Bile  were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in feces and serum. The microbiome of the ileal content was determined by 16S rDNA next-generation sequencing.At 10 weeks, tumors masses in the TG reached a mean weight of 1.10 g (interquartile range 3.45 g) associated with a significant reduction in WAT. Furthermore, in the TG, there was a marked reduction in leptin and an increase in glucagon-like peptide 1 serum levels. Moreover, the TG mice displayed a pro-inflammatory profile, with significant increases in monocyte chemotactic protein 1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-10. Lithocholic , deoxycholic , and ursodeoxycholic  were significantly decreased in the stool of TG mice. Significant alterations of the intestinal microbiome were found in the ileal contents of the TG.The present study provides a first glimpse that human NB in a murine model induces tumor cachexia associated with alterations in metabolic and inflammatory parameters, as well as changes in the intestinal microbiota.

Generally, late-harvested giant reed had higher dry matter content, lower nitrogen content, and higher water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) content than early-harvested giant reed. During 90days of ensilage, giant reed harvested in October, November, and December showed dry matter losses of about 1%, while giant reed harvested in August showed a higher dry matter loss of about 8%. During the ensilage process, more lactic  was produced in late-harvested giant reed than in early-harvested giant reed. Late-harvested giant reed had a higher lignin content and lower enzymatic digestibility than early-harvested giant reed. However, enzymatic digestibility of all the giant reed biomass was improved by the 90-day ensilage process, reaching levels of 43-46%. In summary, ensilage could be used for storing giant reed biomass harvested at different times and for improving its digestibility.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Much attention has been directed at protic ionic liquids as promising candidates, but in the search for highly conductive systems the possibility of designing Grotthuss diffusion-enabled protic ionic liquids has been widely overlooked. Herein, the mechanics of proton-transfer mechanism in the equimolar mixture of N-methylimidazole and acetic  was explored using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The ionicity of the system is approximated with good agreement to experiments. This system consists mostly of neutral species but exhibits a high ionic conductivity through Grotthuss-like proton conduction. Chains of acetic- molecules and other species participating in the proton-transfer mechanisms resembling Grotthuss diffusion could be directly observed. Furthermore, based on these findings, a series of static quantum chemical calculations was conducted to investigate the effect of substituting the anion and cation with different functional groups. We predict whether a given combination of cation and anion will be a true ionic liquid or a molecular mixture and propose some systems as candidates for Grotthuss diffusion-enabled protic ionic liquids.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

JSC4 and enhancing its oil production by optimizing light intensity.</a></h1><p>Marine microalgae are among the most promising lipid sources for biodiesel production because they can be grown on nonarable land without the use of potable water. Marine microalgae also  solar  efficiently with a high growth rate, converting CO2 into lipids stored in the cells. Both light intensity and nitrogen availability strongly affect the growth, lipid accumulation, and fatty  composition of oleaginous microalgae. However, very few studies have systematically examined how to optimize lipid productivity by adjusting irradiance intensity, and the metabolic dynamics that may lead to improved lipid accumulation in microalgae have not been elucidated. Little is known about the mechanism of lipid synthesis regulation in microalgae. Moreover, few studies have assessed the potential of using marine microalgae as oil producers.In this work, a newly isolated marine microalga, Chlamydomonas sp. JSC4, was selected as a potential lipid producer, and the effect of photobioreactor operations on cell growth and lipid production was investigated. The combined effects of light intensity and nitrogen depletion stresses on growth and lipid accumulation were further explored in an effort to markedly improve lipid production and quality. The optimal lipid productivity and content attained were 312 mg L(-1) d(-1) and 43.1% per unit dry cell weight, respectively. This lipid productivity is the highest ever reported for marine microalgae. Metabolic intermediates were profiled over time to observe transient changes during lipid accumulation triggered by combined stresses. Finally, metabolite turnover was also assessed using an in vivo (13)C-labeling technique to directly measure the flow of carbon during lipid biosynthesis under stress associated with light intensity and nitrogen deficiency.This work demonstrates the synergistic integration of cultivation and dynamic metabolic profiling technologies to develop a simple and effective strategy for enhancing oil production in a marine microalga. The knowledge obtained from this study could be useful in assessing the feasibility of marine microalgae biodiesel production and for understanding the links between dynamic metabolic profiles and lipid biosynthesis during the course of microalgal cultivation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27459002>Divergent evolution for diverse substrate recognition by family 31 glycoside hydrolases.</a></h1><p>Carbohydrates make up an important component of our diet, contributing a significant portion to our total caloric intake.

Family 31 α-glucosidases are a group of glycoside hydrolases that has been shown to play a key role in the metabolic process of hydrolyzing dietary starch into monomers of glucose. The purpose of the research presented here is to explore evolutionary changes that occurred within this family of glycoside hydrolases, and to relate these divergences to observed structural differences in relation to predicted substrate preferences. Here we report specific single amino  changes that are believed to have arisen through evolution, and are directly related to the ability of these enzymes to bind different starch-based glycans. Through phylogenetic analysis we observed a number of evolutionary adaptions that we believe resulted in duplicated genes that allow for the efficient utilization of dietary starch.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28116575>Enhanced Oil Production by the Tropical Marine Diatom Thalassiosira Sp. Cultivated in Outdoor Photobioreactors.</a></h1><p>Microalgae-derived oils have potential as a biofuel feedstock. To produce microalgal oils at a large scale, large amounts of nutrients and  are needed to grow the algae. In this study, we evaluated three types of agricultural fertilizer (AF)-based culture media (AF1, AF2, and AF3) based on a previously published enriched seawater (ES) medium to produce biomass and oils from Thalassiosira sp. Under laboratory conditions, the highest cell productivity of Thalassiosira sp. was obtained with the AF3 medium. Thalassiosira sp. cultured in the AF3 medium produced 10.4 ± 0.9 mg L dayoils, which is significantly higher than the 5.8 ± 0.7 mg L dayproduced in the ES medium. The higher production was due to the presence of nitrate and trace elements, both of which played roles in enhancing biomass and oil content, respectively. During cell growth, resting spores appeared inside the cells and were a marker to  the cells. Because of the abundant availability of sunlight in the tropics during the year, the oil production of Thalassiosira sp. in the AF3 medium was scaled up using outdoor photobioreactors under different weather conditions (rainy and dry seasons). Thalassiosira sp. produced more unsaturated fatty  during the rainy season and produced more saturated fatty  during the dry season. This study also demonstrated that it was possible to culture Thalassiosira sp. under outdoor conditions using a low-cost agricultural fertilizer-based culture medium (AF3 medium) to produce biodiesel feedstock with an annual production of 8.1 ± 0.4 t ha during the dry season and of 23.9 ± 6.8 t ha during the rainy season.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28214696>Unraveling the influence of the COD/sulfate ratio on organic matter removal and methane production from the biodigestion of sugarcane vinasse.</a></h1><p>Throughout the sugarcane , it is common for sulfate to accumulate in the vinasse of sugar and ethanol plants. However, little is known regarding the influence of sulfate on the anaerobic digestion (AD) of vinasse, which may lead to severe performance losses. This study assessed the influence of various COD/sulfate ratios (12.0, 10.0 and 7.5) on both COD removal and methane (CH) production from sugarcane vinasse AD. Batch assays were conducted in thermophilic conditions. At a COD/sulfate ratio of 7.5, CH production was 35% lower compared with a ratio of 12.0, considering a diversion of approximately 13.6% of the electron flow to sulfidogenesis. The diversion of electrons to sulfidogenesis was negligible at COD/sulfate ratios higher than 25, considering the exponential increase in CH production. Organic matter degradation was not greatly affected by sulfidogenesis, with COD removal levels higher than 80%, regardless of the initial COD/sulfate ratio.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Obesity is associated with overactivation of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in adult subjects, but the role of the ECS in the developmental origins of obesity is mostly unknown. The ECS consists of endocannabinoids, cannabinoid receptors (cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1) and cannabinoid type-2 receptor (CB2)) and metabolising enzymes. We hypothesised that perinatal maternal HF diet would alter the ECS in a sex-dependent manner in white and brown adipose tissue of rat offspring at weaning in parallel to obesity development. Female rats received standard diet (9 %  content from fat) or HF diet (29 %  content from fat) before mating, during pregnancy and lactation. At weaning, male and female offspring were killed for tissue . Maternal HF diet induced early obesity, white adipocyte hypertrophy and increased lipid accumulation in brown adipose tissue associated with sex-specific changes of the ECS's components in weanling rats. In male pups, maternal HF diet decreased CB1 and CB2 protein in subcutaneous adipose tissue. In female pups, maternal HF diet increased visceral and decreased subcutaneous CB1. In brown adipose tissue, maternal HF diet increased CB1 regardless of pup sex. In addition, maternal HF diet differentially changed oestrogen receptor across the adipose depots in male and female pups. The ECS and oestrogen signalling play an important role in lipogenesis, adipogenesis and thermogenesis, and we observed early changes in their targets in adipose depots of the offspring. The present findings provide insights into the involvement of the ECS in the developmental origins of metabolic disease induced by inadequate maternal nutrition in early life.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25426858>In vitro characterization of the impact of different substrates on metabolite production,  extraction and composition of gut microbiota from lean and obese subjects.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of galacto-oligosaccharides, lactulose, apple fiber and sugar beet pectin on the composition and activity of human colonic microbiota of lean and obese healthy subjects using an in vitro model of the proximal colon: TIM-2. Substrate fermentation was assessed by measuring the production of short-chain and branched-chain fatty , lactate and ammonia and by studying the composition of the bacterial communities over time. The results suggest that   (in terms of metabolites) of lean and obese microbiotas is different and may depend on the fermentable substrate. For galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose, the cumulative amount of short-chain fatty  plus lactate produced in TIM-2 was lower in the fermentation experiments with the lean microbiota (123 and 155 mmol, respectively) compared to the obese (162 and 173 mmol, respectively). This was reversed for the pectin and the fiber. The absolute amount produced of short-chain fatty  including lactate was higher after 72 h in the fermentation experiments with apple fiber-L (108 mmol) than with apple fiber-O (92 mmol). Sugar beet-L was also higher (130 mmol) compared to sugar beet-O (103 mmol). Galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose boosted the balance of health-promoting over toxic metabolites produced by the microbiota from obese subjects. Firmicutes were more predominant in the inoculum prepared from feces of obese subjects compared to lean subjects. The average abundance at time zero was 92% and 74%, respectively.

Following this target, different calcium carbonate-titania nanostructures were prepared by three different pathways using available raw materials such as limestone as calcium precursor. After characterization of the prepared materials with X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) patterns, Fourier transmission infrared (FT-IR), high resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM), N adsorption-desorption isotherm, UV-vis diffuse reflectance and photoluminance (PL), the materials were applied as novel photocatalysts for desulfurization of dibenzothiophene (DBT) and gas oil using different radiation sources at room temperature. It has been obtained that, 95% desulfurization of DBT was possible under 1 h visible light irradiation with linear halogen lamp (LHL) at catalyst/DBT-solution = 10 g/L, while ultra-clean diesel production (99% removal, 3.47 ppm) could be obtained via normal sunlight photochemical desulfurization of diesel fuel by calcium carbonate titania photocatalyst in presence of HO and acetic  as oxidizing agents and acetonitrile as a solvent. Here, the followed preparation pathway produced highly active calcium titanate photocatalysts with tunable band gap  (2.05 eV), reduced electrons/hole pairs recombination and stable photocatalytic activity with enhanced visible light removal of organosulfur compounds for economic ultra-clean fuel production, pollution control, and environmental management.Copyright © 2019.

This review provides information on the mean content and variability in chemical composition, fatty  (FA) profile and ensiling quality of maize silages, and discusses the major factors which cause these variations. In addition, the effect of the broad range in chemical composition of maize silages on the total tract digestibility of dietary nutrients, milk production and milk composition of dairy cows is quantified and discussed. Finally, the optimum inclusion level of maize silage in the ration of dairy cows for milk production and composition is reviewed. The data showed that the nutritive value of maize silages is highly variable and that most of this variation is caused by large differences in maturity at . Maize silages ensiled at a very early stage (dry matter (DM) < 250 g kg(-1)) were particularly low in starch content and starch/neutral detergent fibre (NDF) ratio, and resulted in a lower DM intake (DMI), milk yield and milk protein content. The DMI, milk yield and milk protein content increased with advancing maturity, reaching an optimum level for maize silages ensiled at DM contents of 300-350 g kg(-1), and then declined slightly at further maturity beyond 350 g kg(-1). The increases in milk (R(2) = 0.599) and protein (R(2) = 0.605) yields with maturity of maize silages were positively related to the increase in starch/NDF ratio of the maize silages. On average, the inclusion of maize silage in grass silage-based diets improved the forage DMI by 2 kg d(-1), milk yield by 1.9 kg d(-1) and milk protein content by 1.2 g kg(-1). Further comparisons showed that, in terms of milk and milk constituent yields, the optimum grass/maize silage ratio depends on the quality of both the grass and maize silages. Replacement of grass silage with maize silage in the ration, as well as an increasing maturity of the maize silages, altered the milk FA profile of the dairy cows, notably, the concentration of the cis-unsaturated FAs, C18:3n-3 and n-3/n-6 ratio decreased in milk fat. Despite variation in nutritive value, maize silage is rich in metabolizable  and supports higher DMI and milk yield. Harvesting maize silages at a DM content between 300 and 350 g kg(-1) and feeding in combination with grass silage results in a higher milk yield of dairy cows.© 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30174024>Effects of simultaneous UV-C radiation and ultrasonic  postharvest treatment on bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity of tomatoes during storage.</a></h1><p>The effects of a novel technology utilizing a simultaneous combination of Ultraviolet-C radiation and ultrasound  postharvest treatment on tomato bioactive compounds during 28 days' storage period was investigated by varying Ultraviolet-C radiation intensities of 639.37 or 897.16 µW/cm at a constant ultrasound intensity of 13.87 W/L from a 40 kHz-1 kW transducer. A minimal treatment time of 240 s at Ultraviolet-C dosage of 2.15 kJ/m was observed to provoke a considerable increase in bioactive compounds content, proportionated to treatment time. Although treatment led to temperature increase in the system reaching 39.33 °C due to heat generation by ultrasonic cavitation, the extractability and biosynthesis of phytochemicals were enhanced resulting in 90%, 30%, 60%, 20%, and 36% increases in lycopene, total phenols, vitamin C, hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activities respectively.

A series of indoline-based unsymmetrical squaraine (SQ) dyes that contain alkyl chains at sp C- and N- atoms of indoline moieties with a carboxylic  anchoring group were synthesized. The optical and electrochemical properties of the SQ dyes in solution were nearly identical as there was no change in the D-A-D SQ framework; however, remarkable changes with respect to the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) were observed depending upon the position of alkyl groups in the dye. Introduction of alkyl groups to the indoline unit that was away from anchoring unit were helped in more dye loading with controlled organization of dyes on surface, increased charge transfer resistance, long electron lifetime, and hence higher PCE than that of the corresponding isomer in which the alkyl groups funtionalized indoline unit contains the carboxylic  anchoring group. Careful analysis of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) profiles indicated the presence of aggregated structure on the TiO surface that contributes to the charge injection in the presence of a coadsorbent. A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) device made out of SQ5 was achieved an efficiency of 9.0%, with an open-circuit potential (V) of 660 mV and short-circuit current density (J) of 19.82 mA/cm, under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW/cm). The IPCE profile of SQ5 shows an onset near to 750 nm with a good quantum efficiency (>80%) in the range of 550-700 nm, indicating the importance of self-organization of dyes on the TiO surface for an efficient charge injection. This present investigation revealed the importance of position of alkyl groups in the squaraine-based dyes for the better PCE.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29037268>Probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics and insulin sensitivity.</a></h1><p>Animal studies indicate that the composition of gut microbiota may be involved in the progression of insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes. Probiotics and/or prebiotics could be a promising approach to improve insulin sensitivity by favourably modifying the composition of the gut microbial community, reducing intestinal endotoxin concentrations and decreasing  . The aim of the present review was to investigate the effects of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics (a combination of probiotics and prebiotics) on insulin resistance in human clinical trials and to discuss the potential mechanisms whereby probiotics and prebiotics improve glucose metabolism. The anti-diabetic effects of probiotics include reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines via a NF-κB pathway, reduced intestinal permeability, and lowered oxidative stress. SCFA play a key role in glucose homeostasis through multiple potential mechanisms of action. Activation of G-protein-coupled receptors on L-cells by SCFA promotes the release of glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY resulting in increased insulin and decreased glucagon secretion, and suppressed appetite. SCFA can decrease intestinal permeability and decrease circulating endotoxins, lowering inflammation and oxidative stress. SCFA may also have anti-lipolytic activities in adipocytes and improve insulin sensitivity via GLUT4 through the up-regulation of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase signalling in muscle and liver tissues. Resistant starch and synbiotics appear to have favourable anti-diabetic effects. However, there are few human interventions. Further well-designed human clinical studies are required to develop recommendations for the prevention of type 2 diabetes with pro- and prebiotics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30682099>Tolerance and dose-response assessment of subchronic dietary ethoxyquin exposure in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.).</a></h1><p>Ethoxyquin (EQ; 6-Ethoxy-2,2,4-trimethyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline) has been used as an antioxidant in feed components for pets, livestock and aquaculture. However, possible risks of EQ used in aquafeed for fish health have not yet been characterized. The present study investigated the toxicity and dose-response of subchronic dietary EQ exposure at doses ranging from 41 to 9666 mg EQ/kg feed in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Feed at concentrations higher than 1173 mg EQ/kg were rejected by the fish, resulting in reduced feed intake and growth performance. No mortality was observed in fish exposed to any of the doses. A multi-omic screening of metabolome and proteome in salmon liver indicated an effect of dietary EQ on bioenergetics pathways and hepatic redox homeostasis in fish fed concentrations above 119 mg EQ/kg feed. Increased  expenditure associated with an upregulation of hepatic fatty  β-oxidation and induction and carbohydrate catabolic pathways resulted in a dose-dependent depletion of intracytoplasmic lipid vacuoles in liver histological sections, decreasing whole body lipid levels and altered purine/pyrimidine metabolism. Increased GSH and TBARS in the liver indicated a state of oxidative stress, which was associated with activation of the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response and glutathione-mediated detoxification processes. However, no oxidative DNA damage was observed. As manifestation of altered  metabolism, the depletion of liver intracytoplasmic lipid vacuoles was considered the critical endpoint for benchmark dose assessment, and a BMDL10 of 243 mg EQ/kg feed was derived as a safe upper limit of EQ exposure in Atlantic salmon.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29767166>Performance of broiler chickens offered nutritionally-equivalent diets based on two red grain sorghums with quantified kafirin concentrations as intact pellets or re-ground mash following steam-pelleting at 65 or 97°C conditioning temperatures.</a></h1><p>The Liverpool Plains is a fertile agricultural region in New South Wales, Australia. Two sorghums from the 2009 Liverpool Plains , sorghums #3 and #5, were extensively characterised which included concentrations of kafirin and phenolic compounds plus rapid visco-analysis (RVA) starch pasting profiles. Diets based on these two sorghums were formulated to be iso-nitrogenous and iso-energetic and were offered to male Ross 308 broiler chicks from 7 to 28 days post--hatch as either intact pellets or reground mash following steam-pelleting at conditioning temperatures of either 65 or 97°C. Thus the feeding study consisted of a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial array of dietary treatments: two sorghum varieties, two feed forms and two conditioning temperatures. Each of the eight treatments was replicated six times with six birds per replicate cage. Assessed parameters included growth performance, nutrient utilisation, apparent starch and protein (N) digestibility coefficients and disappearance rates from the distal jejunum and distal ileum. Intact pellets supported higher ( < 0.001) feed intakes and weight gains by 9.83 and 9.08%, respectively, than reground mash diets. Feed conversion ratios of broilers offered diets steam-conditioned at 97°C were 2.46% inferior ( < 0.001) in comparison to 65°C diets and both apparent metabolizable  (AME) and N-corrected AME (AMEn) were compromised. Broilers offered sorghum #3-based diets significantly ( < 0.001) outperformed their sorghum #5 counterparts in terms of weight gain by 3.75% (1,334 versus 1,223 g/bird), FCR by 4.81% (1.524 versus 1.601), AME by 1.06 MJ (13.61 versus 12.55 MJ/kg), ME:GE ratio (ME:GE) by 4.81% (0.806 versus 0.769) and AMEn by 1.03 MJ (12.38 versus 11.35 MJ/kg). The inferiority of sorghum #5 appeared to be associated with higher concentrations of kafirin (61.5 versus 50.7 g/kg) and conjugated phenolic , including ferulic  (31.1 versus 25.6 µg/g). There were no significant differences in jejunal and ileal starch and protein (N) digestibility coefficients between the two sorghums. However, starch to protein (N) disappearance rate ratios from the distal jejunum were significantly ( < 0.001) correlated with ME:GE and AME. The multiple linear regression equations indicated that  utilisation was enhanced by coupling rapidly digestible protein with slowly digestible starch, which suggests that bilateral bioavailability of starch and protein is pivotal to efficient  utilisation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26428064>Fluctuation of Arabidopsis seed dormancy with relative humidity and temperature during dry storage.</a></h1><p>The changes in germination potential of freshly harvested seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana stored in various combinations of temperature and relative humidity were investigated over 63 weeks of storage. Seeds of the wild type Col-0 and of two mutants displaying low and high levels of dormancy, cat2-1 and mtr4-1, respectively, were stored at  in 24 different environments including a combination of eight relative humidities, from 1 to 85%, and four temperatures (10, 15, 20, and 25 °C). These mutations did not influence behaviour of seeds during storage. Primary dormant seeds did not germinate in darkness at 25 °C but acquired the potential to germinate at this temperature within 7 weeks when stored in relative humidities close to 50% across all temperatures. Sorption isotherms and Arrhenius plots demonstrated that the seed moisture content of 0.06 g H2O/g dry weight was a critical value below which dormancy release was associated with reactions of negative activation  and above which dormancy release increased with temperature. Longer storage times when relative humidity did not exceed 75-85% led to decreased germination at 25 °C, corresponding to the induction of secondary dormancy. Dormancy release and induction of secondary dormancy in the dry state were associated with induction or repression of key genes related to abscisic  and gibberellins biosynthesis and signalling pathways. In high relative humidity, prolonged storage of seeds induced ageing and progressive loss of viability, but this was not related to the initial level of dormancy.© The Author 2015.

The addition of LAB inoculants to silage has been associated with increases in silage digestibility, dry matter intake (DMI), and milk yield. Given the potential change in silage and rumen fermentation conditions accompanying these silage additives, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of LAB silage inoculants on DMI, digestibility, milk yield, milk composition, and methane (CH4) production from dairy cows in vivo. Eight mid-lactation Holstein-Friesian dairy cows were grouped into 2 blocks of 4 cows (multiparous and primiparous) and used in a 4×4 double Latin square design with 21-d periods. Methane emissions were measured by indirect calorimetry. Treatments were grass silage (mainly ryegrass) with no inoculant (GS), with a long-term inoculant (applied at ; GS+L), with a short-term inoculant (applied 16h before feeding; GS+S), or with both long and short-term inoculants (GS+L+S). All diets consisted of grass silage and concentrate (75:25 on a dry matter basis). The long-term inoculant consisted of a 10:20:70 mixture of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, and Lactobacillus buchneri, and the short-term inoculant was a preparation of Lc. lactis. Dry matter intake was not affected by long-term or short-term silage inoculation, nor was dietary neutral detergent fiber or fat digestibility, or N or  balance. Milk composition (except milk urea) and fat and protein-corrected milk yield were not affected by long- or short-term silage inoculation, nor was milk microbial count. However, milk yield tended to be greater with long-term silage inoculation. Methane expressed in units of grams per day, grams per kilogram of DMI, grams per kilogram of milk, or grams per kilogram of fat and protein-corrected milk yield was not affected by long- or short-term silage inoculation. However, CH4 expressed in units of kilojoules per kilogram of metabolic body weight per day tended to be greater with long-term silage inoculation. Results of this study indicate minimal responses in animal performance to both long- and short-term inoculation of grass silage with LAB. Strain and dose differences as well as different basal silages and ensiling conditions are likely responsible for the lack of significant effects observed here, although positive effects have been observed in other studies.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

However, poor outdoor winter cultivation capacity currently limits deployment potential. In this study, 300 distinct algal strains were screened in saline medium to determine their cultivation suitability during winter conditions in Mesa, Arizona. Three strains, from the genera , and , were chosen following laboratory evaluations and grown outdoors in 1000 L raceway ponds during the winter. Strains were down-selected based on doubling time, lipid and carbohydrate amount, final biomass accumulation capacity, cell size and phylogenetic diversity. Algal biomass productivity and compositional analysis for lipids and carbohydrates show successful outdoor deployment and cultivation under winter conditions for these strains. Outdoor -yield biomass productivities ranged from 2.9 to 4.0 g/m/day over an 18 days winter cultivation trial, with maximum productivities ranging from 4.0 to 6.5 g/m/day, the highest productivities reported to date for algal winter strains grown in saline media in open raceway ponds. Peak fatty  levels ranged from 9 to 26% percent of biomass, and peak carbohydrate levels ranged from 13 to 34% depending on the strain. Changes in the lipid and carbohydrate profile throughout outdoor growth are reported. This study demonstrates that algal strain screening under simulated outdoor environmental conditions in the laboratory enables identification of strains with robust biomass productivity and biofuel precursor composition. The strains isolated here represent promising winter deployment candidates for seasonal algal biomass production when using crop rotation strategies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25992959>Metabolic -based modelling explains product yielding in anaerobic mixed culture fermentations.</a></h1><p>The fermentation of glucose using microbial mixed cultures is of great interest given its potential to convert wastes into valuable products at low cost, however, the difficulties associated with the control of the process still pose important challenges for its industrial implementation. A deeper understanding of the fermentation process involving metabolic and biochemical principles is very necessary to overcome these difficulties. In this work a novel metabolic  based model is presented that accurately predicts for the first time the experimentally observed changes in product spectrum with pH. The model predicts the observed shift towards formate production at high pH, accompanied with ethanol and acetate production. Acetate (accompanied with a more reduced product) and butyrate are predicted main products at low pH. The production of propionate between pH 6 and 8 is also predicted. These results are mechanistically explained for the first time considering the impact that variable proton motive potential and active transport  costs have in terms of   over different products yielding. The model results, in line with numerous reported experiments, validate the mechanistic and bioenergetics hypotheses that fermentative mixed cultures products yielding appears to be controlled by the principle of maximum   and the necessity of balancing the redox equivalents in absence of external electron acceptors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29962176>Effect of Lactobacillus Plantarum TWK10 on Improving Endurance Performance in Humans.</a></h1><p>Microbiota is currently an important issue in disease and health and many studies have revealed it to play an important role in physiological homeostasis and health promotion. Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum), isolated from Taiwan pickled vegetables, is a well-known probiotic microorganism. In a recent animal study, it was shown that supplementation of mice with L. plantarum TWK10 (TWK10) could increase muscle mass, improve exercise performance and exert anti-fatigue effects. In order to examine the ergogenic effect of TWK10 supplementation on endurance performance in humans, we conducted a human double-blind placebo-controlled clinical study. A total of sixteen adult subjects over 20 years of age were recruited and randomly allocated to the placebo or TWK10 group (n = 8 each). The TWK10 group received 6 weeks of supplementation. Physiological assessments were conducted by exhaustive treadmill exercise measurements and related biochemical indexes. After 6 weeks of supplementation, levels of lactic , blood ammonia, blood glucose, free fatty  (FFA) and creatine kinase (CK) were evaluated during exhaustive exercise. We were able to show that the TWK10 group had significantly higher endurance performance and glucose content in a maximal treadmill running test compared to the placebo group (P < 0.05), suggesting that TWK10 supplementation may be beneficial to  .

The current study provides a better understanding of the biochemical response of first- (n = 246) or second-parity (n = 127) sows during late gestation through lactation and assesses relationships with piglet production and dam reproductive performance. Plasma samples were collected from first- or second-parity dams at late gestation (110 d gestation [d110G]), d 1 post-farrowing (d1PF), and weaning (WN) then analyzed for various stress and protein metabolism compounds, including; creatine, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity, creatinine, urea nitrogen, albumin, and lactate. Litter performance was measured as number of piglets nursed and piglet ADG. Post-weaning reproductive performance was assessed by measuring weaning-to-estrus interval (WEI) and subsequent ovulation rate collected at time of . Plasma creatine and CPK activity increased (P < 0.05) between d110G and d1PF. Plasma creatinine decreased (P < 0.05) from d110G through WN in first-parity dams, but remained similar between d110G and d1PF before declining (P < 0.05) at WN in second-parity dams. Plasma urea nitrogen increased (P < 0.05) over the course of the study and was negatively (P < 0.05) associated with piglet ADG at d110G and d1PF and with ovulation rate at d110G (P < 0.05). Similarly, plasma albumin increased (P < 0.05) in first-parity dams over the course of the study, whereas it plateaued (P < 0.05) at d1PF and remained similar (P > 0.10) through WN in second-parity dams. First-parity dams had less (P < 0.05) plasma lactate at d110G than at d1PF or WN. However, second-parity dams had increased (P < 0.05) plasma lactate at d110G and d1PF, then decreased (P < 0.05) levels at WN. Plasma lactate at WN was positively (P < 0.05) associated with WEI in first-parity dams, but negatively (P < 0.05) related to WEI at d1PF in second-parity dams. Plasma lactate levels at all time points were positively (P < 0.05) associated with ovulation rate in second-parity dams. The biochemical profile of these dams differed by parity and merits further investigations into these differences to identify methods to improve physiological response to lactation for improved animal welfare, production, and reproductive performance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28724349>16S rRNA gene-based association study identified microbial taxa associated with pork intramuscular fat content in feces and cecum lumen.</a></h1><p>Intramuscular fat (IMF) that deposits among muscle fibers or within muscle cells is an important meat quality trait in pigs.

Whether gut microbiota exerts effect on IMF remains unknown.In this study, we investigated the microbial community structure of 500 samples from porcine cecum and feces using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that phylogenetic composition and potential function capacity of microbiome varied between two types of samples. Bacteria wide association study identified 119 OTUs significantly associated with IMF in the two types of samples (FDR < 0.1). Most of the IMF-associated OTUs belong to the bacteria related to polysaccharide degradation and amino  metabolism (such as Prevotella, Treponema, Bacteroides and Clostridium). Potential function capacities related to metabolisms of carbohydrate,  and amino , cell motility, and membrane transport were significantly associated with IMF content.

Chev.) C.F. Liang et A.R. Ferguson, cv. "Hayward"] is classified as climacteric fruit and the initiation of endogenous ethylene production following  is induced by exogenous ethylene or chilling exposure. To understand the biological basis of this "dilemma," kiwifruit ripening responses were characterized at 20°C following treatments with exogenous ethylene (100 μL L(-1), 20°C, 24 h) or/and chilling temperature (0°C, 10 days). All treatments elicited kiwifruit ripening and induced softening and endogenous ethylene biosynthesis, as determined by 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic  (ACC) content and ACC synthase (ACS) and ACC oxidase (ACO) enzyme activities after 10 days of ripening at 20°C. Comparative proteomic analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE-PAGE) and nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) revealed 81 kiwifruit proteins associated with ripening. Thirty-one kiwifruit proteins were identified as commonly regulated by the three treatments accompanied by dynamic changes of 10 proteins specific to exogenous ethylene, 2 to chilling treatment, and 12 to their combination. Ethylene and/or chilling-responsive proteins were mainly involved in disease/defense, , protein destination/storage, and cell structure/cell wall. Interactions between the identified proteins were demonstrated by bioinformatics analysis, allowing a more complete insight into biological pathways and molecular functions affected by ripening.

Lipolysis induces a remodeling process within AT that is characterized by an inflammatory response, cellular proliferation, and changes in the extracellular matrix (ECMT). The adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) is a key component of the inflammatory response. Infiltration of ATM-forming cellular aggregates was demonstrated in transition cows, suggesting that ATM trafficking and phenotype changes may be associated with disease. However, it is currently unknown if ATM infiltration occurs in dairy cows only during NEB states related to the transition period or also during NEB-induced lipolysis at other stages of lactation. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in ATM trafficking and inflammatory phenotypes, and the expression of genetic markers of AT remodeling in healthy late-lactation cows during feed restriction-induced NEB. After a 14-d (d -14 to d -1) preliminary period, Holstein cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 feeding protocols, ad libitum (AL) or feed restriction (FR), for 4 d (d 1-4). Caloric intake was reduced in FR to achieve a targeted  balance of -15 Mcal/d of net  for lactation. Omental and subcutaneous AT samples were collected laparoscopically to  stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells on d -3 and 4. The FR induced a NEB of -14.1±0.62 Mcal/d of net  for lactation, whereas AL cows remained in positive  balance (3.2±0.66 Mcal/d of NE). The FR triggered a lipolytic response reflected in increased plasma nonesterified fatty  (0.65±0.05 mEq/L on d 4), enhanced phosphorylation of hormone sensitive lipase, and reduced adipocyte diameter. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that on d 4, FR cows had increased numbers of CD172a, an ATM (M1 and M2) surface marker, cells in SVF that were localized in aggregates. However, FR did not alter the number of SVF cells expressing M1 markers (CD14 and CD11c) or M2 markers (CD11b and CD163). This finding contrasts with the predominately M1 phenotype observed previously in ATM from clinically diseased cows. No changes were observed in the expression of ECMT-related or cell proliferation markers. In summary, an acute 4-d lipolytic stimulus in late-lactation dairy cows led to ATM infiltration with minimal changes in inflammatory phenotype and no changes in ECMT. These results underscore that physiological changes related to parturition, the onset of lactation, extended periods of lipolysis, or a combination of these can induce intense AT remodeling with enhanced ATM inflammatory phenotype expression that may impair the metabolic function of AT in transition dairy cattle.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

Improved understanding of metabolism associated with the disorder would improve our understanding of soft scald and contribute to developing more effective management strategies for apple storage. It was expected that specific gene expression and specific metabolite levels in the peel would be linked with soft scald risk at  and/or specific time points during cold storage.Fruit from nine 'Honeycrisp' apple orchards that would eventually develop different incidences of soft scald between 4 and 8 weeks of cold air storage were used to contrast and determine differential transcriptomic and metabolomic changes during storage. Untargeted metabolic profiling revealed changes in a number of distinct pathways preceding and concurrent with soft scald symptom development, including elevated γ-aminobutryic  (GABA), 1-hexanol, acylated steryl glycosides, and free p-coumaryl acyl esters. At , levels of sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid acyl esters were relatively higher in peel of fruit that did not later develop the disorder. RNA-seq driven gene expression profiling highlighted possible involvement of genes and associated metabolic processes with soft scald development. These included elevated expression of genes involved in lipid peroxidation and phenolic metabolism in fruit with soft scald, and isoprenoid/brassinosteroid metabolism in fruit that did not develop soft scald. Expression of other stress-related genes in fruit that developed soft scald included chlorophyll catabolism, cell wall loosening, and lipid transport while superoxide dismutases were up-regulated in fruit that did not develop the disorder.This study delineates the sequential transcriptomic and metabolomic changes preceding soft scald symptom development. Changes were differential depending on susceptibility of fruit to the disorder and could be attributed to key stress related and mediating pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31229103>Riboflavin applications to grapevine leaves and berries blue-light post- treatments modifies grape anthocyanins and amino  contents.</a></h1><p>Light is an  source and key environmental factor for plants. Out of the different light wavelengths, blue-light is one of the most relevant spectral regions because of its relation to anthocyanins biosynthesis. Among the compounds present in grapes, anthocyanins determine their main organoleptic and healthy properties; while a minimum concentration of ammonium and amino  is necessary for a desirable development of the alcoholic fermentation. Moreover, amino  are precursors of several volatile compounds synthetized during the fermentation. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of riboflavin (vitamin B2) applications, at  and one week later,to grapevine leaves in combination with post- blue-light irradiation on Tempranillo (Vitis vinifera L.) grape anthocyanins and amino acidscomposition. The combination of blue-light irradiation and two riboflavin doses as well as theseindividual factors affected both grape anthocyanins and amino acidsconcentrations. After one week of storage, anthocyanins concentration diminished when clusters were irradiated with blue-light; while for amino  content, the trend to increase or decrease is dependent on the riboflavin dose applied in vines and the storage time.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

During 20 days of fermentation, 10.4-, 3.4-, 3.0-, and 1.8-fold increments in extraction yield of syringic , vanillic , p-hydroxybenzoic , and caffeic , respectively, were reached when compared to biologically untreated corn silage. Maximal laccase activity was gained on the 4th day of fermentation (V.A. = 180.2 U/dm), and manganese peroxidase activity was obtained after the 3rd day of fermentation (V.A. = 30.1 U/dm). The addition of copper(II) sulfate as inducer during solid state fermentation resulted in 8.5- and 7-fold enhancement of laccase and manganese peroxidase activities, respectively. Furthermore, the influence of pH and temperature on enzyme activities was investigated.

The effect of flocculant dosage, the order of flocculant addition, mixing speed, and growth stage on the harvesting efficiency was evaluated. Results showed that the flocculation using combined flocculants significantly decreases the flocculant dosage and settling time compared with control. It was also found that CaO and γ-PGA influenced microalgal flocculation by changing the zeta potential of cells and pH of microalgal suspension. The most suitable order of flocculant addition was CaO first and then γ-PGA. The optimal mixing speed was 200 rpm for 0.5 min, followed by 50 rpm for another 4.5 min for CaO and γ-PGA with the highest flocculation efficiency of 95 % and a concentration factor of 35.5. The biomass concentration and lipid yield of the culture reusing the flocculated medium were similar to those when a fresh medium was used. Overall, the proposed method requires low  input, alleviates biomass and water contamination, and reduces utilization of water resources and is feasible for harvesting C. vulgaris for biofuel and other bio-based chemical production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25921831>The role of the gut microbiota in metabolic health.</a></h1><p>The global prevalence of obesity and related comorbidities has increased considerably over the past decades. In addition to an increase in food consumption and a reduction in physical activity, growing evidence implicates the microorganisms in our gastrointestinal tract, referred to as the gut microbiota, in obesity and related metabolic disturbances. The composition of the gut microbiota can fluctuate markedly within an individual and between individuals. Changes in gut microbial composition may be unfavorable and predispose an individual to disease. Studies in mice that are germ free, mice that are cohoused, and mice that are treated with antibiotics have provided some evidence that changes in gut microbiota may causally contribute to metabolic disorders. Several mechanisms have been proposed and explored that may mediate the effects of the gut microbiota on metabolic disorders. In this review, we carefully analyze the literature on the connection between the gut microbiota and metabolic health, with a focus on studies demonstrating a causal relation and clarifying potential underlying mechanisms. Despite a growing appreciation for a role of the gut microbiota in metabolic health, more experimental evidence is needed to substantiate a cause-and-effect relationship. If a clear causal relationship between the gut microbiota and metabolic health can be established, dietary interventions can be targeted toward improving gut microbial composition in the prevention and perhaps even the treatment of metabolic diseases.© FASEB.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875531>Physiological and biochemical responses of two spring wheat genotypes to non-hydraulic root-to-shoot signalling of partial and full root-zone drought stress.</a></h1><p>Non-hydraulic root-sourced signal (nHRS) is so far affirmed to be a unique positive early-warning response to drying soil, however its physiological and agronomic implications are still unclear. We designed two contrast methods to induce nHRS in two wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes released in different decades under pot-culture conditions. Partial root-zone stress (PS) was performed using the method of split-root alternative water supply (one half wetting and the other drying) to induce the continuous operation of nHRS, and full root-zone stress (FS) was subjected to whole root system to periodic operation of nHRS. nHRS-mediated signalling increased abscisic  (ABA) production and triggered ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation, which, thereby, led to up-regulation of antioxidant defense system. Cytokinin synthesis reduced during drought stress while proline and malodialdehyde (MDA) content were increased. Regardless of drought treatment methods and wheat genotype, a significant decrease in grain yield, root biomass and above-ground biomass (p < 0.05) was observed, without significant changes in root-to-shoot ratio.  index was increased, proposing that more  was allocated to reproductive organs during the action of nHRS. Moreover, higher water use efficiency was witnessed in PS. The data suggest that nHRS triggered ABA accumulation, thereby closing stomata, and reducing water use and also decreases the production of ROS and improves the antioxidant defence enzymes, thus enhancing drought tolerance. This survey of different-decade genotypes suggests that advances in grain yield and drought tolerance would be made by targeted selection for a wheat genetic resource.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This study assesses adequacy of children's protein intakes in Ethiopia, where QPM is being promoted, accounting for protein quality and seasonal dietary changes, and estimates potential increases in intakes if QPM replaced conventional maize in diets. Diets of randomly sampled children aged 12⁻36 months in rural southern Ethiopia ( = 218) were assessed after  during relative food security and 3⁻4 months later during relative food insecurity using 24-h weighed food records. Diets were analyzed for protein adequacy, accounting for protein quality using the protein digestibility corrected amino  score (PDCAAS) method, and potential improvements from QPM substitution were estimated. Stunting was prevalent (38%) at the first assessment. Across seasons, 95⁻96% of children consumed maize, which provided 59⁻61% of  and 51⁻55% of total protein in 24 h. Dietary intakes decreased in the food insecure season, though children were older. Among children no longer breastfeeding, QPM was estimated to reduce inadequacy of utilizable protein intakes from 17% to 13% in the food secure season and from 34% to 19% in the food insecure season. However, breastfed children had only 4⁻6% inadequate intakes of utilizable protein, limiting QPM's potential impact. Due to small farm sizes, maize stores from home production lasted a median of three months. Young Ethiopian children are at risk of inadequate quality protein intakes, particularly after breastfeeding has ceased and during food insecurity. QPM could reduce this risk; however, reliance on access through home production may result in only short-term benefits given the limited quantities of maize produced and stored.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28419348>Litchi Fruit LcNAC1 is a Target of LcMYC2 and Regulator of Fruit Senescence Through its Interaction with LcWRKY1.</a></h1><p>Senescence is a key factor resulting in deterioration of non-climacteric fruit. NAC transcription factors are important regulators in plant development and abiotic stress responses, yet little information regarding the role of NACs in regulating non-climacteric fruit senescence is available. In this study, we cloned 13 NAC genes from litchi (Litchi chinensis) fruit, and analyzed subcellular localization and expression profiles of these genes during post- natural and low-temperature-delayed senescence. Of the 13 NAC genes, expression of LcNAC1 was up-regulated in the pericarp and pulp as senescence progressed, and was significantly higher in senescence-delayed fruit than that in naturally senescent fruit. LcNAC1 was induced by exogenous ABA and hydrogen peroxide. Yeast one-hybrid analysis and transient dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that LcNAC1 was positively regulated by the LcMYC2 transcription factor. LcNAC1 activated the expression of LcAOX1a, a gene associated with reactive oxygen species regulation and  metabolism, whereas LcWRKY1 repressed LcAOX1a expression. In addition, LcNAC1 interacted with LcWRKY1 in vitro and in vivo. These results indicated that LcNAC1 and LcWRKY1 form a complex to regulate the expression of LcAOX1a antagonistically. Taken together, the results reveal a hierarchical and co-ordinated regulatory network in senescence of harvested litchi fruit.© The Author 2017.

It is even higher than the prevalence in the United States. Certainly, China's economic open-ups, improving living standard, and modernization have propagated the surge. From a traditional public-health point of view, increased food intake and decreased exercise were the main contributors. A new knowledge of colon microbiota could be applied to provide a second  of food ; for example, large molecules of carbohydrates, which are undigested by the stomach and small intestine, produce by-products that the body can absorb in the colon. Colon microbiota can ferment these carbohydrates to the short-chain fatty  butyrate. This is an  source that may even cause nonalcoholic fatty liver. How these colon microbiota contribute to the surge of diabetes and whether this new knowledge can be used to control diabetes and metabolic syndrome are questions for future scientific studies. Clinically, however, colon microbiota have had immediate applications; fecal microbiota have been transplanted from healthy persons to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile infection at Mayo Clinic.

However, little is known about the intracellular biological processes occurring during the blooming period. This study compared the protein profiles of field-collected and laboratory-cultured blooming cells of Skeletonema costatum, and identified highly and differentially expressed proteins using the shotgun proteomic approach. A total of 1372 proteins were confidently identified with two or more peptides. Among them, 222 and 311 proteins were unique to the laboratory and field samples respectively. Proteins involved in photosynthesis, translation, nucleosome assembly, carbohydrate and  metabolism dominated the protein profiles in both samples. However, different features of specific proteins were also found: proteins participated in light harvesting, photosynthetic pigment biosynthesis, photoprotection, cell division and redox homeostasis were highly detected in the field sample, whereas proteins involved in translation, amino  and protein metabolic processes, and nitrogen and carbon assimilation presented high detection rates in the laboratory sample. ATP synthase cf1 subunit beta and light  complex protein were the most abundant protein in the laboratory and field samples respectively.

As the intestinal microbiota plays an important role in  , it is likely to influence FE. Therefore, our aim was to characterize the intestinal microbiota of pigs ranked as low, medium, and high residual feed intake ([RFI] a metric for FE), where genetic, nutritional, and management effects were minimized, to explore a possible link between the intestinal microbiota and FE. Eighty-one pigs were ranked according to RFI between weaning and day 126 postweaning, and 32 were selected as the extremes in RFI (12 low, 10 medium, and 10 high). Intestinal microbiota diversity, composition, and predicted functionality were assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Although no differences in microbial diversity were found, some RFI-associated compositional differences were revealed, principally among members of , predominantly in feces at slaughter (albeit mainly for low-abundance taxa). In particular, microbes associated with a leaner and healthier host (e.g., , , and ) were enriched in low RFI (more feed-efficient) pigs. Differences were also observed in the ileum of low RFI pigs; most notably,  () were less abundant. Predictive functional analysis suggested improved metabolic capabilities in these animals, especially within the ileal microbiota. Higher ileal isobutyric  concentrations were also found in low RFI pigs. Overall, the differences observed within the intestinal microbiota of low RFI pigs compared with that of their high RFI counterparts, albeit relatively subtle, suggest a possible link between the intestinal microbiota and FE in pigs. This study is one of the first to show that differences in intestinal microbiota composition, albeit subtle, may partly explain improved feed efficiency (FE) in low residual feed intake (RFI) pigs. One of the main findings is that, although microbial diversity did not differ among animals of varying FE, specific intestinal microbes could potentially be linked with porcine FE. However, as the factors impacting FE are still not fully understood, intestinal microbiota composition may not be a major factor determining differences in FE. Nonetheless, this work has provided a potential set of microbial biomarkers for FE in pigs. Although culturability could be a limiting factor and intervention studies are required, these taxa could potentially be targeted in the future to manipulate the intestinal microbiome so as to improve FE in pigs. If successful, this has the potential to reduce both production costs and the environmental impact of pig production.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31378499>Ensiled pulp from biorefining increased milk production in dairy cows compared with grass-clover silage.</a></h1><p>The objective of the current study was to examine the effect of fibrous pulp and partial substitution of soybean meal with green protein concentrate from biorefining of grass-clover on dry matter intake, milk production, digestibility, and eating behavior in dairy cows compared with untreated grass-clover silage and soybean meal. Biorefining of grass-clover occurred right after  in a production-scale twin-screw press. The twin-screw pressing separated the grass-clover into a pulp and a green juice. The green juice was fermented using lactic  bacteria for protein precipitation and then decanted, and the precipitate was heat dried to constitute the green protein concentrate. From the same field, grass-clover was harvested 6 d later due to rainy weather and was prewilted before ensiling. The pulp and the grass-clover were ensiled in bales without additives. The production trial consisted of an incomplete 6 × 4 Latin square trial (3-wk periods; 12 wk total) including 36 lactating Holstein cows. The trial had 6 treatments in a 2 × 3 factorial design with 2 forage types (grass-clover silage and pulp silage) and 3 protein treatments (low protein, high protein with soybean meal, and high protein with a mixture of soybean meal and green protein). The trial was designed to test silage type, protein type, protein level, and the interaction between protein level and silage type. The forage:concentrate ratio was 55:45 in low protein total mixed rations (TMR) and 51:49 in high protein TMR. Low protein and high protein TMR were composed of 372 and 342 g/kg of DM of experimental silages, respectively, and green protein supplemented TMR was composed of 28.5 g/kg of DM of green protein. Silage type did not affect dry matter intake of cows. The average -corrected milk yield was 37.0 and 33.4 kg/d for cows fed pulp silage and grass-clover silage, respectively, resulting in an improved feed efficiency in the cows receiving pulp silage. Milk fat concentration was greater in milk from cows fed pulp silage, and milk protein concentration was lower compared with milk from cows fed grass-clover silage. The in vivo digestibility of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber was greater for pulp silage diets compared with grass-clover silage diets. Eating rate was greater, whereas daily eating duration was lower, for pulp silage diets compared with grass-clover silage diets. The partial substitution of soybean meal with green protein did not affect dry matter intake, milk yield, or eating behavior. The in vivo digestibility of crude protein in green protein supplemented diets was lower compared with soybean meal diets. The results imply that extraction of protein from grassland plants can increase the value of the fiber part of grassland plants.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Anaerobic processes are suitable for the treatment of wastewater high in organics to achieve pollution control and recovery of  as methane and hydrogen, or intermediates for production of biofuels and valuable biochemicals. A distinction between protein hydrolysis and amino  fermentation, especially for dissolved proteins, is needed to target which one is truly rate-limiting and to effectively  bioproducts during anaerobic conversion of these wastewaters. This study explored mesophilic anaerobic hydrolysis and amino  fermentation of gelatine, as a model for dissolved proteins, at pH 7 and at pH 5.The results showed that at pH 7, protein hydrolysis (first-order rate of 0.15 h) was approximately 5 times faster than acidification of the hydrolysis products (first-order rate of 0.03 h), implying that not hydrolysis but acidification was the rate-limiting step in anaerobic dissolved protein degradation. This was confirmed by (temporary) accumulation of amino . Nineteen different amino  were detected during the first 8 incubation hours of gelatine at neutral pH and the total chemical oxygen demand (COD) of these 19 amino  was up to approximately 40% of the COD of the gelatine that was added. Protein hydrolysis at pH 5 was 2-25 times slower than at pH 7. Shifting the initial pH from neutral to acidic conditions (pH 5) inhibited protein degradation and changed the volatile fatty  (VFA) product profile. Furthermore, the presence or absence of methanogenic activity did not affect the rates of protein hydrolysis and acidification.The findings in this study can help to set a suitable solid retention time to accomplish anaerobic degradation of protein-rich wastewaters in continuous reactor systems. For example, if the target is harvesting VFAs, methanogens can be washed-out for a shorter retention time while amino  fermentation, instead of hydrolysis as assumed previously, will govern the design and solutions to improve the system dealing with dissolved proteins.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443457>Differential Impact of Subtherapeutic Antibiotics and Ionophores on Intestinal Microbiota of Broilers.</a></h1><p>Antimicrobial growth promoters (AGPs) are commonly used in the livestock industry at subtherapeutic levels to improve production efficiency, which is achieved mainly through modulation of the intestinal microbiota.

Deep sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that two ionophores drastically reduced a number of rare bacteria resulting in a significant decrease in richness and a concomitant increase in evenness of the cecal microbiota, whereas three antibiotics had no obvious impact. Although each AGP modulated the gut microbiota differently, the closer the antibacterial spectrum of AGPs, the more similarly the microbiota was regulated.

The optimization of the composition of the culture medium through statistical experimental designs improved the specific growth rate of Amphora sp. from 0.149 to 0.262 day(-1) and increased its 15-day culture biomass production from 465 to 2200 mg L(-1) (dw) and its lipid content from 140 to 370 mg g(-1) (dw). Highest biomass productivity of 178 mg L(-1) day(-1) was achieved at the 10th day of culture. Highest lipid content of 530 mg g(-1) (dw) was obtained under phosphorus starvation and 64.34% of these lipids were saturated fatty . A first growth stage, in optimized condition, would thus offer the maximum productivity for an algal biomass feed stream, followed by second stressful stage for lipid accumulation, thus suitable for biodiesel production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27617199>Causality of small and large intestinal microbiota in weight regulation and insulin resistance.</a></h1><p>The twin pandemics of obesity and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) are a global challenge for health care systems. Changes in the environment, behavior, diet, and lifestyle during the last decades are considered the major causes. A Western diet, which is rich in saturated fat and simple sugars, may lead to changes in gut microbial composition and physiology, which have recently been linked to the development of metabolic diseases.We will discuss evidence that demonstrates the influence of the small and large intestinal microbiota on weight regulation and the development of insulin resistance, based on literature search.Altered large intestinal microbial composition may promote obesity by increasing   through specialized gut microbes. In both large and small intestine, microbial alterations may increase gut permeability that facilitates the translocation of whole bacteria or endotoxic bacterial components into metabolic active tissues. Moreover, changed microbial communities may affect the production of satiety-inducing signals. Finally, bacterial metabolic products, such as short chain fatty  (SCFAs) and their relative ratios, may be causal in disturbed immune and metabolic signaling, notably in the small intestine where the surface is large. The function of these organs (adipose tissue, brain, liver, muscle, pancreas) may be disturbed by the induction of low-grade inflammation, contributing to insulin resistance.Interventions aimed to restoring gut microbial homeostasis, such as ingestion of specific fibers or therapeutic microbes, are promising strategies to reduce insulin resistance and the related metabolic abnormalities in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes.

The harvested MaB-floc biomass (33tonTSha(-1)y(-1)) needs further valorization. Therefore, the biochemical methane yield (BMY) of MaB-floc biomass was determined in batch experiments. The results show significant differences between the BMY of MaB-flocs amongst their  dates (128-226NLCH4kg(-1)VS), a low anaerobic digestion conversion efficiency (25.0-36.2%), a moderate chlorophyll a removal (51.5-86.9%) and a low biogas profit (<0.01€m(-3)wastewater). None of the pretreatment methods screened (freezing, thermal, microwave, ultrasonic and chlorination, flue gas sparging, and ) can be recommended due to a low BMY improvement and/or unfavorable  balance. Therefore, anaerobic digestion of this MaB-floc biomass should only be granted a supporting role within a biorefinery concept.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated how gut microbiota manipulation by antibiotics (7-day administration of amoxicillin, vancomycin, or placebo) affects host metabolism in 57 obese, prediabetic men. Vancomycin, but not amoxicillin, decreased bacterial diversity and reduced Firmicutes involved in short-chain fatty  and bile  metabolism, concomitant with altered plasma and/or fecal metabolite concentrations. Adipose tissue gene expression of oxidative pathways was upregulated by antibiotics, whereas immune-related pathways were downregulated by vancomycin. Antibiotics did not affect tissue-specific insulin sensitivity, /substrate metabolism, postprandial hormones and metabolites, systemic inflammation, gut permeability, and adipocyte size. Importantly,  , adipocyte size, and whole-body insulin sensitivity were not altered at 8-week follow-up, despite a still considerably altered microbial composition, indicating that interference with adult microbiota by 7-day antibiotic treatment has no clinically relevant impact on metabolic health in obese humans.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We assessed diet adequacy and the quality of complementary foods by conducting a diet assessment of 128 Ugandan children, ages 6-59 months, who participated in a 10-week programme for children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM, defined as weight-for-age z-score < -2). Caregivers were given a weekly ration of 650 kcal day(-1) (126 g day(-1) ) of a peanut/soy LNS. Two 24-h dietary recalls were administered per child. LNS was offered to 86% of targeted children at least once. Among non-breastfed children, over 90% met their estimated average requirement (EAR) cut-points for all examined nutrients. Over 90% of breastfed children met EAR cut-points for nutrient density for most nutrients, except for zinc where 11.7% met cut-points. A lower proportion of both breastfed and non-breastfed children met adjusted EARs for the specific nutritional needs of MAM. Fewer than 20% of breastfed children met EAR nutrient-density guidelines for MAM for zinc, vitamin C, vitamin A and folate. Underweight status, the presence of a father in the child's home, and higher programme attendance were all associated with greater odds of feeding LNS to targeted children. Children in this community-based supplemental feeding programme who received a locally produced LNS exhibited substantial micronutrient deficiencies given the special dietary needs of this population. These results can help inform programme strategies to improve LNS targeting, and highlight potential nutrient inadequacies for consumers of LNS in community-based settings.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25403512>Modeling the vacuolar storage of malate shed lights on pre- and post- fruit acidity.</a></h1><p>Malate is one of the most important organic  in many fruits and its concentration plays a critical role in organoleptic properties. Several studies suggest that malate accumulation in fruit cells is controlled at the level of vacuolar storage. However, the regulation of vacuolar malate storage throughout fruit development, and the origins of the phenotypic variability of the malate concentration within fruit species remain to be clarified. In the present study, we adapted the mechanistic model of vacuolar storage proposed by Lobit et al. in order to study the accumulation of malate in pre and postharvest fruits. The main adaptation concerned the variation of the free  of ATP hydrolysis during fruit development. Banana fruit was taken as a reference because it has the particularity of having separate growth and post- ripening stages, during which malate concentration undergoes substantial changes. Moreover, the concentration of malate in banana pulp varies greatly among cultivars which make possible to use the model as a tool to analyze the genotypic variability. The model was calibrated and validated using data sets from three cultivars with contrasting malate accumulation, grown under different fruit loads and potassium supplies, and harvested at different stages.The model predicted the pre and post- dynamics of malate concentration with fairly good accuracy for the three cultivars (mean RRMSE = 0.25-0.42). The sensitivity of the model to parameters and input variables was analyzed. According to the model, vacuolar composition, in particular potassium and organic  concentrations, had an important effect on malate accumulation. The model suggested that rising temperatures depressed malate accumulation. The model also helped distinguish differences in malate concentration among the three cultivars and between the pre and post- stages by highlighting the probable importance of proton pump activity and particularly of the free  of ATP hydrolysis and vacuolar pH.This model appears to be an interesting tool to study malate accumulation in pre and postharvest fruits and to get insights into the ecophysiological determinants of fruit acidity, and thus may be useful for fruit quality improvement.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31455813>The complex structure of bile salt hydrolase from Lactobacillus salivarius reveals the structural basis of substrate specificity.</a></h1><p>The gut bacterial bile salt hydrolase (BSH) plays a critical role in host lipid metabolism and  . Therefore, BSH is a promising microbiome target to develop new therapies to regulate obesity in humans and novel non-antibiotic growth promoters for food animals. We previously reported the 1.90 Å apo crystal structure of BSH from Lactobacillus salivarius (lsBSH). In this study, we soaked the lsBSH crystal with glycocholic  (GCA), a substrate, and obtained a 2.10 Å structure containing complex of lsBSH bound to GCA and cholic  (CA), a product. The substrate/product sits in the water-exposed cavity molded by Loops 2 and 3. While the glycine moiety of GCA is exposed into a highly polar pocket, the sterane core of GCA is stabilized by aromatic and hydrophobic interactions. Comparison of product binding with BSH from Clostridium perfringenes reveals a distinct orientation of the sterane core in the binding site. The stability of the substrate-lsBSH complex and the putative catalytic mechanism were explored with molecular dynamics simulations. Site-directed mutagenesis of lsBSH demonstrated that Cys2 and Asn171 are critical for enzymatic activity, while Tyr24, Phe65 and Gln257 contribute to the substrate specificity. Together, this study provides structural insights into BSH-substrate interaction, the mechanism of catalysis and substrate specificity, which facilitate rational design of BSH inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29775500>Endosperm sugar accumulation caused by mutation of PHS8/ISA1 leads to pre- sprouting in rice.</a></h1><p>Pre- sprouting (PHS) is an unfavorable trait in cereal crops that could seriously decrease grain yield and quality. Although some PHS-associated quantitative trait loci or genes in cereals have been reported, the molecular mechanism underlying PHS remains largely elusive. Here, we characterized a rice mutant, phs8, which exhibits PHS phenotype accompanied by sugary endosperm. Map-based cloning revealed that PHS8 encodes a starch debranching enzyme named isoamylase1. Mutation in PHS8 resulted in the phytoglycogen breakdown and sugar accumulation in the endosperm. Intriguingly, with increase of sugar contents, decreased expression of OsABI3 and OsABI5 as well as reduced sensitivity to abscisic  (ABA) were found in the phs8 mutant. Using rice suspension cell system, we confirmed that exogenous sugar is sufficient to suppress the expression of both OsABI3 and OsABI5. Furthermore, overexpression of OsABI3 or OsABI5 could partially rescue the PHS phenotype of phs8. Therefore, our study presents important evidence supporting that endosperm sugar not only acts as an essential  source for seed germination but also determines seed dormancy and germination by affecting ABA signaling.© 2018 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29474840>Production of muconic  in plants.</a></h1><p>Muconic  (MA) is a dicarboxylic  used for the production of industrially relevant chemicals such as adipic , terephthalic , and caprolactam. Because the synthesis of these polymer precursors generates toxic intermediates by utilizing petroleum-derived chemicals and corrosive catalysts, the development of alternative strategies for the bio-based production of MA has garnered significant interest. Plants produce organic carbon skeletons by harvesting carbon dioxide and  from the sun, and therefore represent advantageous hosts for engineered metabolic pathways towards the manufacturing of chemicals. In this work, we engineered Arabidopsis to demonstrate that plants can serve as green factories for the bio-manufacturing of MA. In particular, dual expression of plastid-targeted bacterial salicylate hydroxylase (NahG) and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (CatA) resulted in the conversion of the endogenous salicylic  (SA) pool into MA via catechol. Sequential increase of SA derived from the shikimate pathway was achieved by expressing plastid-targeted versions of bacterial salicylate synthase (Irp9) and feedback-resistant 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate synthase (AroG). Introducing this SA over-producing strategy into engineered plants that co-express NahG and CatA resulted in a 50-fold increase in MA titers. Considering that MA was easily recovered from senesced plant biomass after , we envision the phytoproduction of MA as a beneficial option to add value to bioenergy crops.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Fatty  are attractive biomolecules due to the flexibility of their iterative biosynthetic pathway, high  content, and suitability for conversion into other secondary chemicals. Free fatty  (FFAs) that can be secreted from the cell are particularly appealing due to their lower  costs and straightforward conversion into a broad range of biofuel and biochemical products. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was engineered to overproduce extracellular FFAs by targeting three native intracellular processes. β-oxidation was disrupted by gene knockouts in FAA2, PXA1 and POX1, increasing intracellular fatty  levels up to 55%. Disruptions in the acyl-CoA synthetase genes FAA1, FAA4 and FAT1 allowed the extracellular detection of free fatty  up to 490mg/L. Combining these two disrupted pathways, a sextuple mutant (Δfaa1 Δfaa4 Δfat1 Δfaa2 Δpxa1 Δpox1) was able to produce 1.3g/L extracellular free fatty . Further diversion of carbon flux into neutral lipid droplet formation was investigated by the overexpression of DGA1 or ARE1 and by the co-overexpression of a compatible lipase, TGL1, TGL3 or TGL5. The sextuple mutant overexpressing the diacylglycerol acyltransferase, DGA1, and the triacylglycerol lipase, TGL3, yielded 2.2g/L extracellular free fatty . This novel combination of pathway interventions led to 4.2-fold higher extracellular free fatty  levels than previously reported for S. cerevisiae.Copyright © 2014 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

Recently, macroalgae have been attracting a wide attention as a source for biofuel. In the present study, ten macroalgae were collected and screened as biodiesel feedstocks. As a result of their high biomass production and relatively high lipid content, Ulva lactuca, Padina boryana and Ulva intestinalis showed the highest significant lipids and fatty  methyl esters (FAMEs) areal productivities among the studied species. Saturated fatty  (SAFs) showed insignificant differences in the selected species, with noticeably significant higher polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs) content in U. lactuca by 4.2 and 3 times, with respect to P. boryana and U. intestinalis, respectively. The recorded increase in PUFAs was attributed to higher content of C16:4n-3, C18:3n-3 and C18:4n-3. By lipid fractionation, P. boryana showed significant higher concentration of neutral lipids (37.7 mg g CDW, representing 46.7% of total fatty ) in comparison to U. lactuca and U. intestinalis, which showed 16% and 17% lower neutral lipid fractions, respectively. In addition, biodiesel characteristics of the studied macroalgae complied with that of international standards. Furthermore, oil-free residual biomass can be readily converted into fermentable sugars or biogas due to its high carbohydrates content, which adds to the economics of macroalgae as biofuel feedstock. In conclusion, the present study confirmed that macroalgae represent an attractive alternative renewable feedstock for biodiesel and other biofuels.Copyright © 2017 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

However, it deteriorates with the pericarp turning brown within 1-2 days after . The factors that mediate litchi fruit senescence are complicated. MicroRNAs act as negative regulators involved in almost every physiological process. To understand the mechanism of litchi fruit senescence and pericarp browning at the miRNA level, five small RNA libraries and a degradome library prepared from the pericarp of litchi fruit subjected to ambient storage and post-cold storage shelf life were sequenced.By aligning the sRNA reads onto the litchi unigene assembly, 296 miRNAs belonging to 49 known miRNA families were first identified from litchi. In addition, 11 litchi-specific miRNAs were identified. Among these, 167 known miRNAs were identified to cleave 197 targets, and three litchi-specific miRNAs were found to have five targets. Through combined analysis of stem-loop quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and transcriptome profiling, 14 miRNA-target pairs were found to be actively involved in litchi fruit senescence-related processes, including  regulation, anthocyanin metabolism, hormone signaling, and pathogen-infection defense.A network of miRNA-targets that regulate litchi fruit senescence has been proposed, revealing the miRNA-mediated regulation in senescent litchi fruit.

Early studies were undertaken to better understand the role of microbiota in carbohydrate digestion and utilization. These processes include polysaccharide degradation, glycan transport, glycolysis, and short-chain fatty  production. Recent research has demonstrated that the intricate axis between gut microbiota and the host metabolism is much more complex. Gut microbiota&mdash;depending on their composition&mdash;have disease-promoting effects but can also possess protective properties. This review focuses on disorders of metabolic syndrome, with special regard to obesity as a prequel to type 2 diabetes, type 2 diabetes itself, and type 1 diabetes.

An anaerobic thermophilic alkaliphilic microbial consortium with efficient degradation ability was screened from bovine manure compost using non-pretreated milling corn stover (CS) and rice straw (RS). A stable microbial consortium ISHI-3 with high degradation ability for CS and RS was isolated by the roll tube technique. ISHI-3 comprised Herbivorax saccincola and bacteria belonging to the classes Pelotomaculum, Tepidanaerobacter, and Tepidimicrobium, as determined by DGGE of the PCR-generated 16S rRNA genes. Furthermore, metagenomics analysis using a 16S rRNA library was carried out to determine the bacterial distribution during degradation of CS and RS. H. saccincola and bacteria belonging to Pelotomaculum were relatively abundant in the beginning to middle periods of culture with CS and RS whereas bacteria belonging to Tepidanaerobacter and Tepidimicrobium gradually increased in the population during the later stages. To understand the role of non-cellulolytic bacteria in the consortium, novel strains ET1 and GL4, which were most closely related to Tepidimicrobium ferriphilum and Tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans, were isolated from ISHI-3. Based on their carbon source usage, morphology, and phylogenetic analysis, we propose that strains ET1 and GL4 should be classified as a novel genus or species. Bacteria ET1 and GL4 can utilize different organic compounds as carbon and  sources such as organic , alcohols, sugars, and amino , showing a preference for organic  and alcohols rather than sugars such as glucose and cellobiose. These results indicated that ET1 and GL4 help to accelerate efficient lignocellulose degradation of H. saccincola.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Corn was planted in March and harvested in July (corn silage-summer; CSS) and a second corn crop was planted in July and harvested in November (corn silage-fall; CSF). A brachytic dwarf brown midrib forage sorghum was planted in April, harvested in July (forage sorghum-summer; FSS), fertilized, and harvested a second time in November (forage sorghum-fall; FSF).

Cows were individually fed experimental diets once daily behind Calan doors for 5wk. Diets were formulated to contain 38.7% of the experimental forages and balanced to provide equal concentrations of protein, fiber, and . No differences were observed in dry matter intake and yields of milk and components, but milk fat percentage was lower for CSS and CSF compared with FSS and FSF, being 3.20, 2.91, 3.42, and 3.53%, respectively. Milk lactose percentage was lower for CSS compared with CSF but was not different from FSS or FSF. Concentrations of milk urea nitrogen were lower for CSS and CSF compared with FSS and FSF (10.6, 13.4, 14.9, and 15.3mg/dL, respectively). No differences were observed in body weight or body condition score change during the trial. Results of this trial suggest that silage produced from brachytic forage sorghum, as either the first or the ratoon crop, can support similar intake and performance as diets based on corn silage.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

When cells undergo cellular respiration, they require a pathway to keep and transfer electrons (i.e., the electron transport chain). Due to oxidation-reduction reactions, the electron transport chain produces a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient.

The convert process is involved in producing ATP which provides  in a lot of cellular processes. In the electron transport chain process, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is one of the most vital molecules for carrying and transferring electrons. Therefore, predicting FAD binding sites in the electron transport chain is vital for helping biologists understand the electron transport chain process and  production in cells.We used an independent data set to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, which had an accuracy of 69.84 %. We compared the performance of the proposed method in analyzing two newly discovered electron transport protein sequences with that of the general FAD binding predictor presented by Mishra and Raghava and determined that the accuracy of the proposed method improved by 9-45 % and its Matthew's correlation coefficient was 0.14-0.5. Furthermore, the proposed method enabled reducing the number of false positives significantly and can provide useful information for biologists.We developed a method that is based on PSSM profiles and SAAPs for identifying FAD binding sites in newly discovered electron transport protein sequences. This approach achieved a significant improvement after we added SAAPs to PSSM features to analyze FAD binding proteins in the electron transport chain. The proposed method can serve as an effective tool for predicting FAD binding sites in electron transport proteins and can help biologists understand the functions of the electron transport chain, particularly those of FAD binding sites. We also developed a web server which identifies FAD binding sites in electron transporters available for academics.</p></html>
