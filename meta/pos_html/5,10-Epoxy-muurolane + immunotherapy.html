Previous work has described an association between CMV seropositivity and cardiovascular disease amongst patients with dialysis dependent end stage renal disease. Whether CMV seropositivity is associated with cardiovascular disease in non-dialysis dependent CKD has not been established.Investigate whether past CMV infection is associated with prevalent cardiovascular disease in patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD.A retrospective observational study using the Renal Impairment in Secondary Care (RIISC) cohort, a study evaluating bio-clinical determinants of outcomes in patients with progressive CKD.We assayed cryopreserved serum samples collected at inception for anti-CMV IgG antibodies from 764 patients with stages 2 to  CKD (pre-dialysis) and investigated its relationship with prevalent cardiovascular disease.Median eGFR was 24 ml/min/1.73m2 (IQR 19-32). Sixty-eight percent of patients were CMV seropositive. CMV seropositivity was associated with older age, non-Caucasian ethnicity, diabetes and higher social deprivation index score. On univariable analysis, CMV seropositivity correlated with higher systolic blood pressure (p = 0.044), prevalent cardiovascular disease (p < 0.001), ischaemic heart disease (p < 0.001) and cerebrovascular disease (p = 0.022). On multivariable analysis, CMV seropositive patients nearly twice as likely to have cardiovascular disease compared to seronegative patients (OR = 1.998, CI 1.231-3.242, p = 0.005).In patients with non-dialysis CKD, CMV seropositivity is independently associated with a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.© The Author(s) 2019.

Such agents could be given in combination or in sequence on the basis of previous response. We aimed to assess the clinical value of maximising responses by using therapeutic agents with different modes of action, the use of which is directed by the response to the initial combination therapy. We aimed to assess response-adapted intensification treatment with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (CVD) versus no intensification treatment in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who had a suboptimal response to initial immunomodulatory triplet treatment which was standard of care in the UK at the time of trial design.The Myeloma XI trial was an open-label, randomised, phase 3, adaptive design trial done at 110 National Health Service hospitals in the UK. There were three potential randomisations in the study: induction treatment, intensification treatment, and maintenance treatment. Here, we report the results of the randomisation to intensification treatment. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had symptomatic or non-secretory, newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, had completed their assigned induction therapy as per protocol (cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and dexamethasone or cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) and achieved a partial or minimal response. For the intensification treatment, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to cyclophosphamide (500 mg daily orally on days 1, 8, and 15), bortezomib (1·3 mg/m subcutaneously or intravenously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11), and dexamethasone (20 mg daily orally on days 1, 2, 4, , 8, 9, 11, and 12) up to a maximum of eight cycles of 21 days or no treatment. Patients were stratified by allocated induction treatment, response to induction treatment, and centre. The co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival, assessed from intensification randomisation to data cutoff, analysed by intention to treat. Safety analysis was per protocol. This study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN49407852, and clinicaltrialsregister.eu, number 2009-010956-93, and has completed recruitment.Between Nov 15, 2010, and July 28, 2016, 583 patients were enrolled to the intensification randomisation, representing 48% of the 1217 patients who achieved partial or minimal response after initial induction therapy. 289 patients were assigned to CVD treatment and 294 patients to no treatment. After a median follow-up of 29·7 months (IQR 17·0-43·), median progression-free survival was 30 months (95% CI 25-36) with CVD and 20 months (15-28) with no CVD (hazard ratio [HR] 0·60, 95% CI 0·48-0·75, p<0·0001), and 3-year overall survival was 77·3% (95% Cl 71·0-83·) in the CVD group and 78·% (72·3-84·6) in the no CVD group (HR 0·98, 95% CI 0·67-1·43, p=0·93). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events for patients taking CVD were haematological, including neutropenia (18 [7%] patients), thrombocytopenia (19 [7%] patients), and anaemia (8 [3%] patients). No deaths in the CVD group were deemed treatment related.Intensification treatment with CVD significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and a suboptimal response to immunomodulatory induction therapy compared with no intensification treatment, but did not improve overall survival. The manageable safety profile of this combination and the encouraging results support further investigation of response-adapted approaches in this setting. The substantial number of patients not entering this trial randomisation following induction therapy, however, might support the use of combination therapies upfront to maximise response and improve outcomes as is now the standard of care in the UK.Cancer Research UK, Celgene, Amgen, Merck, Myeloma UK.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Although several studies have examined the risk of OFCs, little has been reported on allergic reactions during OFCs depending on the indication. This study assessed the prevalence, severity and treatment of allergic reactions depending on the indication for OFCs.We performed a prospective multicenter study between March 2012 and May 2013. Severity of symptoms elicited by OFCs was classified according to grading of anaphylaxis that ranges from grade 1 (most mild) to grade  (most severe).A total of 5062 cases (median age, 3.8 years; males, 65.2%) were analyzed. Allergic reactions were elicited in 2258 (44.6%) OFCs, of which 991 (43.9%) were classified as grade 1, 736 (32.6%) were classified as grade 2, 340 (15.1%) were classified as grade 3, and 191 (8.%) were classified as grade 4-. Epinephrine was administered in 7.1% (n=160) of positive OFCs. Among the top three most common food allergens (hen's egg, cow's milk, and wheat), severity differed significantly depending on the indication for OFC, and adjusted standardized residuals indicated that severity of allergic reactions was higher for the indication to assess threshold level for oral . In addition, the prevalence of epinephrine use was highest for the indication to determine safe intake quantity.Our study suggested that prevalence, severity, and treatment of allergic reactions differ depending on the indication for OFC. Further studies are needed to determine differences in risks depending on the indication for OFC.© 2019 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

All patients underwent a desensitization protocol with commercial peach juice. Rising doses of peach juice were administered, starting with an initial dose of seven drops of a 1/1000 dilution and finishing with a dose of  ml at visit 17. At visit 18, all patients performed an open challenge with whole juice at a cumulative dose of 200 ml. All adverse reactions occurring during the administration of the different doses were recorded. Levels of rPru p 3 in the juice were quantified.There were no severe reactions during the desensitization process in the 24 patients. Seven patients (29%) reported mild oral symptoms, and two patients (8%) had urticaria associated with co-factors (one due to exercise and another due to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Nineteen patients were able to swallow  ml of juice and five withdrew from the study. In two pregnant patients the final challenge was not performed. In all, 17/24 patients were able to consume 200 ml peach juice without developing symptoms.Oral  with the regimen used in this study is an effective and safe short-term therapeutic option for patients with allergy to LTPs. Commercial peach juice appears to be suitable for this treatment.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661484>[Pooled Human Immunoglobulin Preparations as Immunomodulating Drugs].</a></h2><p>It is time to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the first successful attempt to develop and use a specific high-titer antitoxic serum for treating diphtheria, a deadly infectious disease. This was followed by major advances in passive  75 years ago (production of pooled human IgG for subcutaneous injection) and 50 years ago (widespread technology for producing immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous administration). More than 200 tons of pooled human IgG are produced per year worldwide. The preparation is used primarily for IgG substitution in patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, as well as for an immunomodulating treatment of a growing number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. These preparations contain the pooled IgG antibody repertoire of a large population of healthy plasma donors. This repertoire includes antibodies that neutralize pathogens and their factors of virulence, anti-idiotypic antibodies, and antibodies to other foreign and own proteins, as well as to carbohydrate antigens. Naturally polyspecific antibodies that are present in all healthy individuals play an important role as a first-line defense against bacteria and viruses. After exposure to protein-modifying agents, some IgG molecules can acquire the ability to bind novel structurally unrelated antigens. This phenomenon is referred to as induced polyspecificity. The list of these protein-modifying molecules was shown to include low-pH buffers, free heme, pro-oxidative ferrous ions, reactive oxygen species, etc. Such modified antibody preparations may have a therapeutic potential, since their administration to animals with experimental sepsis or aseptic systemic response syndromes significantly improved survival rates, while the same dose of the native preparation had no effect. We also hypothesize that the aggressive protein-modifying molecules released in sites of inflammation and tissue damage could also modify the antigen-binding behavior of surface immunoglobulin B cell receptors and the structurally related T cell receptors. This "specificity editing" of both types of receptors may play a major role in the body's defense mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604779>Lynch syndrome-associated ultra-hypermutated pediatric glioblastoma mimicking a constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome.</a></h2><p>Pediatric glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has a poor prognosis as a result of recurrence after treatment of surgery and radiochemotherapy. A small subset of pediatric GBMs presenting with an ultra-high tumor mutational burden (TMB) may be sensitive to immune checkpoint inhibition. Here we report a 16-yr-old male with an ultra-hypermutated GBM. After incomplete surgical resection, molecular analysis of the tumor identified unusually high numbers of mutations and intratumor heterogeneity by a hotspot next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel. Further comprehensive molecular profiling identified a TMB of 343 mutations/Mb. An ultra-hypermutation genotype in pediatric GBMs is suggestive of a constitutive mismatch repair deficiency syndrome (CMMRD), which often acquires additional somatic driver mutations in replicating DNA polymerase genes. Tumor sequencing identified two  nonsense variants, a hotspot  mutation and a mutational signature supportive of a germline MMR deficiency with a somatic  mutation.

Despite its remarkable clinical effects, this therapy has side effects that cannot be underestimated. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is one of the most clinically important and potentially life-threatening toxicities. This syndrome is a systemic immune storm that involves the mass cytokines releasing by activated immune cells. This phenomenon causes multisystem damages and sometimes even death. In this study, we reported the management of a patient with recurrent and refractory multiple myeloma and three patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia who suffered CRS during CAR-T treatment. The early application of tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, according to toxicity grading and clinical manifestation is recommended especially for patients who suffer continuous hyperpyrexia, hypotensive shock, acute respiratory failure, and whose CRS toxicities deteriorated rapidly. Moreover, low doses of dexamethasone (-10 mg/day) were used for refractory CRS not responding to tocilizumab. The effective management of the toxicities associated with CRS will bring additional survival opportunities and improve the quality of life for patients with cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546041>EURACAN/IASLC proposals for updating the histologic classification of pleural mesothelioma: towards a more multidisciplinary approach.</a></h2><p>Molecular and immunologic breakthroughs are transforming the management of thoracic cancer, although advances have not been as marked for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) where pathologic diagnosis has been essentially limited to three histologic subtypes.A multidisciplinary group (pathologists, molecular biologists, surgeons, radiologists and oncologists), sponsored by EURACAN/IASLC met in 2018, to critically review the current classification.Recommendations include: 1) classification should be updated to include architectural patterns, and stromal and cytologic features that refine prognostication 2) subject to data accrual, malignant mesothelioma in situ could be an additional category, 3) grading of epithelioid MPMs should be routinely undertaken, 4) favorable/unfavorable histologic characteristics should be routinely reported, ) clinically relevant molecular data (PD-L1, BAP1, CDKN2A) should be incorporated into reports, if undertaken, 6) other molecular data should be accrued as part of future trials 7) resection specimens (i.e. extended pleurectomy/decortication and extrapleural pneumonectomy) should be pathologically staged with smaller specimens being clinically staged, 8) ideally, at least 3 separate areas should be sampled from the pleural cavity, including areas of interest identified on pre-surgical imaging, 9) image-acquisition protocols/imaging terminology should be standardized to aid research/refine clinical staging, 10) multidisciplinary tumor boards should include pathologists to ensure appropriate treatment options are considered, 11) all histologic subtypes should be considered potential candidates for chemotherapy, 12) patients with sarcomatoid or biphasic mesothelioma should not be excluded from first line clinical trials unless there is a compelling reason, 13) tumor subtyping should be further assessed in relation to duration of response to , 14) systematic screening of all patients for germline mutations is not recommended, in the absence of a family history suspicious for BAP1 syndrome.These multidisciplinary recommendations for pathology classification and application will allow more informative pathologic reporting and potential risk stratification, to support clinical practice, research investigation and clinical trials.Copyright © 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

Therefore, diagnostic markers for colorectal dysplasia and cancer are urgently needed for patients with UC. Stathmin 1 (STMN1) is a novel cancer biomarker that is also a novel target for treatment in several cancers, including colon cancer. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between STMN1 expression and clinical features in colorectal dysplasia and cancer in patients with UC. The present study examined the clinical significance of STMN1 expression in colorectal dysplasia and cancer with UC. The present study performed an immunohistochemical analysis of 31 clinical colorectal samples from eight patients with colorectal dysplasia and/or cancer to assess the relationships between STMN1 expression and clinicopathological features including mismatch repair protein expression, rate of Ki-67 positivity, differentiation level, TNM stage, and UC duration. STNM1 expression was detected in 95.7% of dysplastic and cancerous lesions, whereas p53, the current diagnostic marker, was not expressed in 39.1% of dysplastic and cancerous lesions. Furthermore, STMN1 expression was associated with a high rate of positivity for Ki-67, a proliferation marker. Our data suggest that STMN1 in the colonic mucosa of UC patients may be useful as an early diagnostic marker of dysplasia and colitic cancer.Copyright: © Osone et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602268>Targeting  for bladder cancer by using anti-CD3 × CD155 bispecific antibody.</a></h2><p>To investigate whether CD155 is an attractive target for T cell-mediated  against human bladder cancer, we examined the novel bispecific antibody anti-CD3 x anti-CD155 (CD155Bi-Ab) for its ability to redirect activated T cells (ATCs) to target bladder cancer cells was examined. Expression of CD155 was detected by flow cytometry on the surface of bladder cancer cells, including T24 and Pumc-91 cells, and their chemotherapeutic drug-resistant counterparts. ATCs generated from healthy donors were stimulated with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody and interleukin-2 (IL-2) for 14 days. The cytotoxic activity of ATCs armed with CD155Bi-Ab against bladder cancer cells was detected by LDH and luciferase quantitative assay. Furthermore, ATCs generated from bladder cancer patients were also armed with CD155Bi-Ab to verity the cell killing by the same methods. In contrast to unarmed ATCs, CD155Bi-armed ATCs against bladder cancer cells were increased cytotoxic activity at effector/target (E/T) ratios of :1, 10:1, and 20:1, with more IFN-γ, TNF-α secreting. It is worth noting that in spite of the presence of immunosuppression in bladder cancer patients and the drug resistance in chemotherapeutic drug-resistant cancer cell lines, not only the anti-tumor effect of CD155Bi-armed ATCs generated from bladder cancer patients still showed significantly but only higher level of activation marker CD69 was expressed. Taken together, our results suggest that CD155 is an effective target for the CD155-positive bladder cancer. And CD155Bi-Ab-armed ATCs are promisingly to provide a novel strategy for current CD155-positive bladder cancer therapy.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605507>Localization of PD-L1 on single cancer cells by iSERS microscopy with Au/Au core/satellite nanoparticles.</a></h2><p>Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an important predictive biomarker. The detection of PD-L1 can be crucial for patients with advanced cancer where the use of  is considered. Here, we demonstrate the use of immuno-SERS microscopy (iSERS) for localizing PD-L1 on single cancer SkBr-3 cells. A central advantage of iSERS is that the disturbing autofluorescence from cells and tissues can be efficiently minimized by red to near-infrared laser excitation. In this study we employed Au/Au core/satellite nanoparticles as SERS nanotags because of their remarkable signal brightness and colloidal stability upon red laser excitation. False-color iSERS images of the positive and negative controls clearly reveal the specific localization of PD-L1 with SERS nanotag-labeled antibodies. This article is protected by copyright.

Standard CNI-based mTOR-free immunosuppression (group A, n=264) was compared to a 50 % reduction of CNI and introduction of the mTOR inhibitor Sirolimus within 4 to 6 weeks after LT (group B, n=261).Median MELD at LT was low with 10 (7 - 15) (group A) and 11 (8 - 15) (group B) in the intention-to-treat approach. CNI dose and CNI trough were reduced by 20% and 8% (group A) versus 55% and 56% (group B) at 3 months post transplantation. Renal function was preserved at 3 months after LT in the Sirolimus arm [eGFR 74 (57-95) versus 67 (55-85) ml/min/1.73m, p=0.004] but was similarly impaired thereafter compared to group A. The per protocol analysis identified LT recipients in group B with concomitant early CNI minimization and Sirolimus treatment ≥ year 1 with significantly superior eGFR and lowest rate of chronic kidney disease (≥ stage 3) from year 1 onwards until study end. Competing risk factors for renal disease (arterial hypertension, fat metabolism disorder and hyperglycemia) were not associated with worse kidney function.Prevention of CNI nephrotoxicity by Sirolimus-based early CNI minimization protects renal function only short-term after LT in the intention-to-treat analysis of this low MELD cohort.

Although cancer cells contain supra-normal concentrations of cytoplasmic DNA, they rarely produce type I IFN spontaneously. This suggests that defects in the DNA-sensing pathway may serve as an immune escape mechanism. We find that cancer cells produce cGAMP that is transferred via gap junctions to tumor-associated dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, which respond by producing type I IFN in situ. Cancer-cell-intrinsic expression of cGAS, but not STING, promotes infiltration by effector CD8 T cells and consequently results in prolonged survival. Furthermore, cGAS-expressing cancers respond better to genotoxic treatments and . Thus, cancer-cell-derived cGAMP is crucial to protective anti-tumor CD8 T cell immunity. Consequently, cancer-cell-intrinsic expression of cGAS determines tumor immunogenicity and makes tumors hot.

Weighted κ similarly showed limited or poor agreement for irAE grade (κ = 0.31-0.75). Differences in assessed time of onset ranged from  to 188 days. As a control for data availability and access, observers had a high degree of agreement for the exact start date (98%) and end date (96%) of  administration, suggesting that information interpretation rather than identification largely accounted for assessment differences. In multivariable analysis, therapy duration (adjusted odds ratio, 4.80; 95% CI, 1.34-17.17; P = .02) and Charlson Comorbidity Index (adjusted odds ratio, 4.09; 95% CI, 1.10-15.18; P = .03) were significantly associated with discordant irAE assessment.These findings underscore critical challenges in assessing the occurrence, type, timing, and severity of irAE. Apart from hypothyroidism (a condition that has a discrete diagnostic laboratory test and few other likely etiologies during  treatment), interobserver agreement was poor. Given the importance of accurate and timely assessment of toxic effects for clinical trials and real-world disease management, efforts to improve irAE diagnosis and characterization are needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673519>Recent developments in limited stage small cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>Limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) remains a challenging disease, with -year overall survival ranging from 30-35% with current standard of care treatment consisting of thoracic radiation to 45 Gy in 30 fractions delivered twice daily, with concurrent platinum/etoposide chemotherapy, followed by prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI).

The emergence of broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance in S. aureus has made the treatment process more difficult. Therefore, it is obvious that an effective prevention strategy against the pathogen could significantly reduce costs related to care in hospitals. In this report, we describe a simple approach to conjugate S. aureus capsular polysaccharide  (CP5) from S. aureus Reynolds strain and 8 (CP8) from S. aureus Becker strain to a fusion protein (Hla-MntC-SACOL0723) and investigation of its bioactivity. The conjugation was done by using ADH (as a bridge) and EDAC (as a coupling agent). The immunoconjugates were characterized by routine polysaccharide/protein contents assays followed by reverse phase chromatography and FTIR spectroscopy. The groups of mice were immunized with conjugate vaccines, capsular polysaccharides, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a control group. The functional activity of the vaccine candidates was evaluated by ELISA, opsonophagocytosis tests, and determination of bacterial load in challenge study. The results showed that the specific antibody (total IgG) titers raised against conjugate molecules were higher than those of the nonconjugated capsular polysaccharides. The opsonic activity of the conjugate vaccines antisera was significantly higher than polysaccharides alone (58% reduction in the number of bacteria versus 16.3% at 1:2 dilution, p < .05), Further, the conjugate vaccine group had a significant reduction in bacterial load after challenge with S. aureus COL strain cells as compared to the PBS and nonconjugated controls.

In this study we evaluated the potential of microneedles to deliver peanut protein extract (PE) into skin and assessed if the ensuing immune responses could desensitize mice that were sensitized to peanuts. Peanut sensitized mice were either treated through cutaneous  using PE-coated microneedles or not treated, and then orally challenged with PE. After oral challenge, the clinical symptoms of peanut-induced anaphylaxis were significantly lower in the microneedle treated mice as compared to untreated mice, and this was accompanied by down-regulation of systemic anaphylaxis mediators such as histamine and mast cell protease-1 (MCPT-1) in the microneedles treated group. Overall, there was an up-regulation of Th1 cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-γ) as compared to Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-) in splenocyte culture supernatants of the microneedle treated group as compared to untreated group, suggesting that microneedles promoted immune modulation towards the Th1 pathway. Furthermore, mice treated with PE-coated microneedles were observed to retain integrity of their small intestine villi and had reduced eosinophilic infiltration as compared to the untreated but peanut sensitized mice, which further confirmed the desensitization capability of peanut cutaneous  using coated microneedles. Thus, our current study represents a novel minimally invasive microneedle based cutaneous , which may provide a novel route of desensitization for the treatment of peanut allergies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, the immunodominant immunoglobulin E (IgE) epitope of the protein Der f 24 was investigated. Analysis of the homologous amino acid (aa) sequences in Der f and human UQCRB was performed. Four different recombinant Der f 24 and hybrid proteins formed by integrating Der f and human UQCRB sequences were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified using Ni‑NTA resins, and IgE‑binding activity was determined using IgE‑western blotting and enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiments. IgE epitopes were further identified by IgE‑dot blotting and IgE‑ELISA with synthetic polypeptides and HDM‑allergic sera. Three‑dimensional (3D) structural modeling was used to analyze the position of the immunodominant IgE epitope. The amino acid sequence homology between Der f 24 and the human UQCRB protein was determined to be 39.34%. IgE‑ELISA and western blot analysis showed that all of the Der f‑human UQCRB hybrid proteins generated, except for the one lacking 59 residues of the N‑terminal region of Der f 24, were bound by allergic serum IgE. A synthetic polypeptide consisting of 32 residues of the N‑terminal reacted with IgEs from HDM‑allergic sera and could be used to generate high titer specific IgG or specific IgE antibodies in immunized mice. The 32‑aa N‑terminal region of Der f 24 was localized to a structural protrusion, which may facilitate specific IgE‑binding. These results indicate that the immunodominant IgE epitope of Der f 24 is located mainly in a 32‑residue region of the N‑terminus.

A school-based vaccination program was implemented. We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study of the adverse events that took place after HPV vaccination, reported to the Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) Information System in Sao Paulo State, from March 2014 to December 2016. All reports that fit the definitions of the 2014 National Manual on AEFI surveillance were included. AEFI risk was estimated by dividing the number of reports by the number of vaccine doses administered in the period. In the three-year period, 3,390,376 HPV vaccine doses were administered and 465 AEFI reports were registered, with 1,378 signs and symptoms. The reporting rate was 13.72 per 100,000 vaccine doses administered. The reports peaked in the first year of the program. The most frequent AEFI was syncope, with .7 reports per 100,000 doses administered, followed by dizziness, malaise, headache and nausea. Overall, 39 AEFI cases (8.4%) were classified as severe , with a reporting rate of 1.15 per 100,000 vaccine doses administered. Most cases were classified as severe because of hospitalization. Among them, there were cases of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, deep vein thrombosis, seizures and miscarriage. All young women recovered without sequelae. We identified five clusters of AEFI reports in four cities; the larger AEFI cluster occurred in the city of Bertioga, in September 2014, involving 13 female adolescents.

MAPC were co-cultured with phenytoin and celecoxib at relevant clinical concentrations for 1 h and 24 h. Anti-inflammatory potency was tested using a stimulated rat splenocyte co-culture and ELISA for TNF-α production. MAPC were cultured under different osmolar concentrations and stained with propidium iodide for viability. Anti-inflammatory potency was tested by co-culture of MAPC with naïve lymphocytes activated by CD3/CD28 beads, and Click-iT® Plus EdU was used to quantify proliferation by flow cytometry.The mean viability of the MAPC infused via needles was 95 ± 1%; no difference was seen with varying flow rate, but viability was notably reduced by chlorhexidine. MAPC function was not impaired by co-culture with phenytoin, celecoxib, or combination with both. Co-culture with phenytoin showed a decrease in TNF-α production as compared to the MAPC control. MAPC cultured at varying osmolar concentrations all had viabilities greater than 90% with no statistical difference between them.

The present study described a case of refractory follicular lymphoma. A high expression of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) was measured on CD3 T cells (80.90%) in peripheral blood samples obtained from the patient enrolled in this study, indicating that treatment with autologous CAR-T 19 cell therapy may not be successful. Therefore, a therapy regimen consisting of CAR-T 19 cells in combination with a reduced dose of nivolumab (1. mg/kg) for PD-1 blockade was used. A low dose of PD-1 blockade therapy was used to reduce the adverse effects associated with the combination of a PD-1 inhibitor and CAR-T 19 cells.

However, minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with hematologic CR is associated with increased risk of relapse, shorter survival, and poorer transplantation outcomes. This study explored the concept of cure in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) BCP-ALL by MRD status at first hematologic CR (CR1) to inform evaluation of the clinical and economic benefits of new agents, where the concept of cure is important but long-term data are not available. The study used modified Delphi methodology involving clinicians experienced in the treatment of adult ALL. Participants completed a questionnaire, which was followed by country-specific panel discussions to discuss results and identify consensus on concepts and definitions. Clinicians from France (n = 4), Germany (n = 4), and the UK (n = ) took part. Participants described cure in terms of the probability of future relapse. Relapse-free survival (RFS) was the preferred outcome measure to describe cure for the three patient groups considered (patients with MRD at CR1; patients who become negative for MRD after further treatment; patients who continue to have MRD). Consensus was reached on definitions of cure: that cure would begin to be considered at 3 years' RFS and/or would be highly likely at  years' RFS. Participants agreed that patients with MRD should usually undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to have the best chance of survival; consensus was reached that alternatives are required when transplantation is not an option. Panels agreed that patients who achieve cure have a higher mortality rate and lower health-related quality of life than the general population.

Despite improved knowledge regarding the genetic background of the tumor and better understanding of the tumor microenvironment, immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (targeting CTLA4, PD1, PDL1) has not been very successful against PDAC. The robust desmoplastic stroma, along with an extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) that is rich in hyaluronan, plays an integral role in this immune evasion. Hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP), a shunt pathway of glycolysis, is a metabolic node in cancer cells that can promote survival pathways on one hand and influence the hyaluronan synthesis in the ECM on the other. The rate-limiting enzyme of the pathway, glutamine-fructose amidotransferase (GFAT1), uses glutamine and fructose 6-phosphate to eventually synthesize UDP-GlcNAc. In the current manuscript, we targeted this glutamine-utilizing enzyme by a small molecule glutamine analog (6-diazo--oxo-L-norleucine or DON). Our results showed that DON decreased the self-renewal potential and metastatic ability of tumor cell. Further, treatment with DON decreased hyaluronan and collagen in the tumor microenvironment, leading to an extensive remodeling of the ECM, and an increased infiltration CD8+ T-cells. Additionally, treatment with DON sensitized pancreatic tumors to anti-PD1 therapy resulting in tumor regression and prolonged survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607049>[Survey on the quadrivalent influenza vaccine intention and related factors of health care workers in the Pearl River Delta region from 2015 to 2017].</a></h2><p> To analyze the quadrivalent influenza vaccine intention of 718 health care workers (HCWs) in the Pearl River Delta region from 2015 to 2017.

Questionnaire survey and face-to-face interview were used to collect the information of influenza vaccination, the intention of the quadrivalent influenza vaccine, the acceptance of free and required vaccination policies, and recommendations for increasing influenza vaccination intentions from 2015 to 2017. The multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze factors associated with the vaccination intention.  A total of 718 HCWs were surveyed and 147 of them were interviewed face to face. Among them, the vaccination rate of primary hospitals [17.39%(40/230)] was higher than that of other hospitals (χ(2)=15.80, 0.05). If the vaccine could be free, 84.82% (609/718) of HCWs would like to be vaccinated.

As randomized clinical trials with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have not been performed in patients with metastatic UM, we analyzed the real-world outcomes in a nationwide population-based study. Clinical data of patients with UM were extracted from the Danish Metastatic Melanoma database, a nationwide database containing unselected records of patients diagnosed with metastatic melanoma in Denmark. Survival before (pre-ICI,  = 32) and after (post-ICI,  = 94) the approval of first-line treatment with ICI was analyzed. A partial response to first-line treatment was observed in 7% of patients treated with anti-programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 monotherapy and in 21% with combined anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 plus anti-PD-1 therapy. Median progression-free survival was 2. months for patients treated in the pre-ICI era compared to 3. months in the post-ICI era (hazard ratio (HR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28-0.67;  < 0.001).

Functional TCR subunit genes are formed by somatic rearrangement, and some of the resulting TCRs recognize autoantigens, the body's own molecules. The autoreactive T cells that carry such TCRs pose a threat of inducing immune reactions against their own organism. In the course of the immune system's development, some autoreactive T lymphocytes are eliminated by apoptosis, some differentiate into immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, which support immunological tolerance to autoantigens, and the rest fall into a non-functional state of anergy. Suppression of effector T cells by regulatory T cells is mediated by immunosuppressive cytokines and costimulatory molecules, depletion of stimulating IL-2, removal of autoreactive peptides together with MHC molecules, and in other ways. Impairment of self-tolerance leads to autoimmune diseases. However, the loss of immunological tolerance can be employed in tumor treatment, allowing  and the use of the potential of autoreactive effector T cells.

After controlling for related factors, the awareness of the influenza vaccination schedule (17.05, 95: .86-49.59), vaccination frequency (8.22, 95: 2.98-22.61) and the free policy (3.15, 95: 1.49-6.67) had higher vaccination rate.  The influenza vaccination rate of HCWs in tertiary hospitals of Xining city was low. Increasing the awareness of the vaccination schedule, frequency and free policy may promote the influenza vaccination rate of HCWs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665020>Clinical significance of PD-L1 expression in serum-derived exosomes in NSCLC patients.</a></h2><p>Exosomes are 50-150 nm endocytic vesicles secreted by almost all type of cells that carry bioactive molecules from host. These small vesicles are considered to be novel cross-talk circuits established by tumor cells and tumor microenvironment. Previous studies have shown certain biological influence of exosomal programmed cell-death ligand 1 (Exo-PD-L1) on immune suppression and dysfunction. The aim of the current study was to investigate the impact of Exo-PD-L1 and soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and explore the concordance between Exo-PD-L1 and PD-L1 expression in matched tumor tissues in NSCLC patients.85 consecutive patients from April 2017 to December 2017 at General Hospital of Eastern Command Theatre who were primarily diagnosed with NSCLC and 27 healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. Two milliliters of whole blood samples were collected from each participant and further centrifuged. Exosomes were derived from serum using the commercial kit (Total Exosome Isolation Kit), which was further identified by Western blotting analysis (CD63/TSG101), transmission electron microscope analysis (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Exosomes were next solubilized for Exo-PD-L1 detection by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). PD-L1 expression in matched tissue were assessed by PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) (clone 28-8) assay. Tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥ 1% was deemed as "positive" in this study and TPS < 1% was deemed as "negative". Written informed consent were obtained before acquisition of all data and biological sample. Data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 and Graphpad Prism  software. Chi square test was conducted to estimate the correlation between Exo-PD-L1 levels, sPD-L1 levels, PD-L1 IHC profiles and clinicopathological features. For all analysis, a two-sided p < 0.05 was considered significant statistically.Exo-PD-L1 levels were higher in NSCLC patients with advanced tumor stage, larger tumor size (> 2. cm) (p < 0.001), positive lymph node status (p < 0.05) and distant metastasis (p < 0.05). In contrast, sPD-L1 levels were not different between NSCLC patients and healthy donors, it was not correlated with any clinicopathologic features except for tumor size (> 2. cm) (p < 0.05). In addition, Exo-PD-L1 levels showed slight correlation with sPD-L1 levels (Spearman's correlation at r = 0.3, p = 0.0027) while no correlation with PD-L1 IHC profiles was detected.In conclusion, Exo-PD-L1, but not sPD-L1, was correlated with NSCLC disease progression, including tumor size, lymph node status, metastasis and TNM stage. However, Exo-PD-L1 was not associated with PD-L1 IHC status.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639763>Component-Resolved Diagnosis in Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma.</a></h2><p>Allergic rhinitis and asthma are highly prevalent chronic inflammatory diseases leading to restrictions in the patient's quality of life and high costs for healthcare systems. Both diseases are associated with the presence of specific IgE (sIgE) against aeroallergens. This review aims to examine the importance of molecular allergy diagnostics in the assessment and management of these disorders.The "U-shaped" approach, proposed by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, combines conventional allergy diagnostics with the benefits of component-resolved diagnosis (CRD) and offers important additional information regarding the patient's sensitization pattern, especially in complex clinical cases such as polysensitization or idiopathic reactions, thus avoiding overuse of in vitro and in vivo IgE diagnostics. CRD may help the clinician to identify the cause of an allergy and, in the case of complex polysensitization, uncover possible cross-reactivity. Polysensitization, especially to inhalant allergens, is associated with the clinical appearance of asthma and allergic rhinitis; important risk factors for the latter are the major allergens Fel d 1 and Can f 1. Importantly, information on molecular sensitization patterns significantly influences the choice of specific  and reduces its overprescription.At present, allergy diagnostics largely rely on clinical history, physical examination, and in vivo IgE testing. However, in vitro diagnostics including CRD are currently finding their way into the clinical routine and can offer additional information on the patient's sensitization profile and treatment responsiveness.© 2018 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629941>Outcome of adolescent patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia aged 10-14 years as compared with those aged 15-17 years: Long-term results of 1094 patients of the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000 study.</a></h2><p>Adolescents (aged 10-17 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) have unfavourable disease features and an inferior outcome when compared with younger children, but it is still unclear if differences in disease biology and prognosis exist between adolescents older or younger than 15 years.We retrospectively analysed outcomes of 1094 adolescents with ALL, aged 10-17 years, treated within the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000 trial, overall and by the age groups 10-14 and 15-17 years.Compared with younger children (aged 1-9 years, n = 3647), adolescents had a statistically inferior -year event-free survival (EFS) [74.6% (1.3) vs. 84.4% (0.6)] and overall survival (OS) [83.4% (1.1) vs. 92.7% (0.4); p < 0.001]. Clinical and biological disease characteristics did not differ between the two subgroups of adolescents, including minimal residual disease (MRD) results during initial therapy, except for ETV6-RUNX1 frequency and gender. With a median follow-up of 8.8 years, the -year EFS and OS were 76.2% (1.) and 84.9% (1.3), respectively, for those aged 10-14 years and 70.0% (2.8) and 78.8% (2.) for those aged 15-17 years (p = 0.06; 0.05). There was no significant difference in the cumulative incidence of relapses [17.8% (1.4) and 18.3% (2.4); p = 0.98], while the incidence of treatment-related deaths as a first event was 2.6% (0.6) versus 7.4% (1.6) (p < 0.001) with, in particular, a higher incidence in the high-risk arm.Further prospective studies and biological investigations are required to define optimal treatment for adolescents, in particular for those aged 15-17 years. Newer agents (, targeted therapy) in early treatment phases of patients at higher risk of treatment failure could replace most toxic treatment elements, with the aim of reducing both toxicity and the risk of relapses.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Intralesional  by Mumps, Measles, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is also a promising treatment modality for multiple warts.To compare the efficacy and safety of both the methods in treating multiple warts.The study included 80 patients divided into two groups (group A and group B), each containing 40 patients. Informed consent was taken from each patient before enrollment into the study. Group A patients were treated by autoimplantation technique every two weeks for a maximum of four treatments. Similarly, Group B patients received MMR intralesional injection at a dose of 0. mL every two weeks for a maximum of four treatments.Complete clearance of the donor wart was observed in 60% patients in group A, whereas complete clearance in the group B injected by MMR was 72.%. On the other hand, a significant difference (p<0.05) was found in the therapeutic response among non-manipulated warts in both groups, where complete clearance was observed in 47.% of group A patients versus 20% of group B patients.Autoimplantation is a suitable approach for patients with multiple warts associated with distant lesions, while MMR injection is ideal for a single or fewer number of warts.

However, the majority of cancer types, including high-risk neuroblastoma remain immunologically unresponsive. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive technique that can mechanically fractionate tumors, transforming immunologically 'cold' tumors into responsive 'hot' tumors.We treated <2% of tumor volume in previously unresponsive, large, refractory murine neuroblastoma tumors with mechanical HIFU, and assessed systemic immune response using flow-cytometry, ELISA, and gene sequencing. In addition, we combined this treatment with αCTLA-4 and αPD-L1 to study its effect on the immune response and long-term survival.Combining HIFU with αCTLA-4 and αPD-L1 significantly enhances anti-tumor response, improving survival from 0 to 62.%. HIFU alone causes upregulation of splenic and lymph node NK cells and circulating IL-2, IFN-Ɣ, and DAMPs, whereas immune regulators like CD4+Foxp3+, IL-10, and VEGF-A are significantly reduced. HIFU combined with checkpoint inhibitors induced significant increases in intratumoral CD4+, CD8ɑ+, and CD8α+CD11c+ cells, CD11c+ in regional lymph nodes, and decrease in circulating IL-10 compared to untreated group. We also report significant abscopal effect following unilateral treatment of mice with large, established bilateral tumors using HIFU and checkpoint inhibitors compared to tumors treated with HIFU or checkpoint inhibitors alone (61.1% survival, p<0.0001). This combination treatment significantly also induces CD4+CD44+CD62L+ and, CD8α+CD44+CD62L+ population and are adoptively transferable imparting immunity, slowing subsequent  tumor engraftment.Mechanical fractionation of tumors using HIFU can effectively induce immune sensitization in a previously unresponsive murine neuroblastoma model, and promises a novel yet efficacious immuno-adjuvant modality to overcome therapeutic resistance.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610668>Alopecia and Hair Damage Induced by Oncological Therapy.</a></h2><p>Damage and loss of hair (alopecia) is a predictable adverse event of oncological therapy. It can be caused by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or targeted and hormonal therapy. From the point of view of patients with malignant disease, hair loss is one of the most feared side effects and adversely affects their mental health. Hair loss can be diffuse, complete, partial, or regional. Worsening of hair quality, cutaneous inflammation, and scarring can also occur. Eyelashes, eyebrows, and body hair can also be lost. Alopecia is mostly reversible, but permanent damage can occur depending on the type, overall length, and dose of oncological treatment and other factors. The risk of alopecia is high with high-dose docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide, but low with platinum chemotherapy, melphalan, and capecitabin. Targeted therapy and  can cause immune-mediated alopecia such as alopecia areata and scarring alopecia as well as paradoxically hypertrichosis and trichomegaly. Physical and pharmacological approaches can be used to prevent and treat alopecia; however, their effectiveness and availability are limited. Modern radiotherapy scalp-sparing methods minimize hair loss. Good results have been obtained with scalp cooling, which reduces the toxic effects of cytostatic agents on hair follicles during short infusion regimens. Several systems cool the scalp to less than 22°C. Minoxidil accelerates hair regrowth and is used as a topical therapy.

Even when response is obtained, regrowth of the tumors is almost inevitable. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of helical tomotherapy for chemo-refractory multiple liver metastases.Forty-five patients with chemo-refractory multiple (3-10) liver metastases after standard systemic chemotherapy entered the single-institutional prospective study. Liver metastases were the major disease; however, 31 also had uncontrolled primary lesions and/or other metastases. The prescribed dose was 55 Gy in 25 fractions. The median planning target volume (PTV) and normal liver volume (NLV) of first treatment were 128 cm and 1175 cm , respectively. The median of V , V , and mean dose to NLV were 45%, 23%, and 19.4 Gy, respectively.Forty-two patients (93%) completed the planned treatment. Median survival time (MST) for all patients was 8 months, and the 1-year survival rate was 29%. The median local control (LC) period was  months and the 6-month control rate of irradiated tumors was 33%. A ≥30% decrease in tumor markers was observed in 31%. The most common grade 3 toxicity was lymphocytopenia (40%), followed by fatigue (6%). Radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) was not observed. Pancreatic cancer as the primary tumor, distant metastases outside the liver, low pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and low pretreatment monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) were associated with poorer prognoses.Helical tomotherapy for chemo-refractory multiple liver metastases is a feasible and potentially effective treatment.

Metformin has recently emerged as a candidate of interest for combination with  in HNSCC. This study investigated the effect of metformin on immune cell infiltrates of HNSCC.Retrospective analysis of T cell infiltrates in primary tumor specimens from patients enrolled in a clinical window of opportunity trial of presurgical metformin. Metformin was titrated to a standard diabetic dose (2000 mg/day) for a minimum of 9 days (mean 13.6 days) prior to surgical resection. Pre and posttreatment surgical specimens from 36 patients (16 HPV , 20 HPV ) were comparatively analyzed. FOXP3 and CD8 immune cell infiltrates in the tumor and peritumoral stroma of pre and posttreatment HNSCC specimens were quantified by digital image analysis using Visiopharm software.Metformin treatment was associated with a 41.4% decrease in FOXP3 T cells in intratumor regions of interest (P = .004) and a 66.% increase in stromal CD8 T cells at the leading edge of the tumor (P = .021) when compared to pretreatment biopsies. This was reflected in increased CD8 /FOXP3 cell ratios within the tumor (P < .001) and stromal compartments (P < .001). The effects of metformin occurred independently of HPV status.Metformin treatment may favorably alter the immune TME in HNSCC independent of HPV status.1b.

Cord blood (CB) natural killer (NK) cells may be promising off-the-shelf effector cells for  due to their recognition of malignant cells without the need for a known target, ready availability from multiple banks, and their potential to expand exponentially. However, they are currently limited by immune suppressive cytokines secreted in the MB tumor microenvironment including Transforming Growth Factor β (TGF-β). Here, we address this challenge in in vitro models of MB.CB-derived NK cells were modified to express a dominant negative TGF-β receptor II (DNRII) using retroviral transduction. The ability of transduced CB cells to maintain function in the presence of medulloblastoma-conditioned media was then assessed.We observed that the cytotoxic ability of nontransduced CB-NK cells was reduced in the presence of TGF-β-rich, medulloblastoma-conditioned media (21.21 ± 1.19% killing at E:T :1 in the absence vs. 14.98 ± 2.11% in the presence of medulloblastoma-conditioned media, n = 8, p = 0.02), but was unaffected in CB-derived DNRII-transduced NK cells (21.11 ± 1.84% killing at E:T :1 in the absence vs. 21.81 ± 3.37 in the presence of medulloblastoma-conditioned media, n = 8, p = 0.85. We also observed decreased expression of CCR2 in untransduced NK cells (mean CCR2 MFI 826 ± 117 in untransduced NK + MB supernatant from mean CCR2 MFI 1639.29 ± 215 in no MB supernatant, n = 7, p = 0.0156), but not in the transduced cells. Finally, we observed that CB-derived DNRII-transduced NK cells may protect surrounding immune cells by providing a cytokine sink for TGF-β (decreased TGF-β levels of 610 ± 265 pg/mL in CB-derived DNRII-transduced NK cells vs. 1817 ± 342 pg/mL in untransduced cells; p = 0.008).CB NK cells expressing a TGF-β DNRII may have a functional advantage over unmodified NK cells in the presence of TGF-β-rich MB, warranting further investigation on its potential applications for patients with medulloblastoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673523>Changing equipoise in the landscape of radiation for oligometastatic lung cancer.</a></h2><p>There is growing interest in exploring use of local therapies in the management of oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to provide durable local and distant disease control. Prospective phase II studies have incorporated local therapy (predominantly stereotactic ablative radiotherapy or SABR) to both primary and metastatic sites. For patients who received these treatments, median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) exceeded that of historical controls treated with systemic therapy alone (9.7-23. and 13.-41.2 months, respectively). Additionally, three trials randomized oligometastatic NSCLC patients to standard of care systemic therapy regimens  local consolidative therapy (LCT) plus standard of care systemic therapy (or observation) and all demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS, with two showing OS benefits to date. Notably, a majority of these trials selected patients with at least stable disease after completion of systemic therapy for local therapy and defined the oligometastatic state as one with no more than five metastatic sites spread across three organs. For patients with oligometastatic NSCLC, there are many important factors that should drive use and timing of local therapy, including metastatic presentation sequence (synchronous  metachronous), extent of disease (number and distribution of sites), and quality of life goals. The referenced clinical trials accrued patients prior to the approval of  for metastatic NSCLC, so the benefits of any local therapy in this setting remain uncertain. To ultimately clarify the role of local therapy in oligometastatic NSCLC in the era of improving systemic therapy efficacy (i.e.,  and targeted therapy combinations with cytotoxics), we recommend enrollment in in phase III studies with OS endpoints (i.e., NRG LU 002 and SARON) whenever possible.

Furthermore, we analyzed six pulmonary colloid adenocarcinomas (CAD), including one primary tumor, one metastasis, and two sample pairs consisting of the primary colloid lung tumor and a matching metastasis and an acinar component, respectively. All samples were characterized using immunohistochemistry (TTF-1, CK7, CK20, CDX2, Ki-67, ALK and PD-L1) and a next generation sequencing panel covering 404 cancer-related genes (FoundationOne® gene panel).While Ki-67 expression was comparably low in IMA (range: 8-15%) and in primary CAD (range: -8%), we observed considerably higher proliferation rates in the non-colloid tumor compartment (16%) and metastases (72%) from CAD, as well as in the PEAD-group (36-71%). The overall tumor mutational burden was lowest in IMA (2. mutations per megabase), intermediate in CAD (.8 mutations per megabase) and highest in PEAD (16.8 mutations per megabase). KRAS mutations were frequent in all three tumor subtypes, but TP53 mutations were mostly limited to PEAD. While chromosomal alterations were rare in IMA, we discovered MYC amplifications in three of four CAD. Comparing primary and metastatic CAD, we observed the acquisition of multiple mutations and chromosomal alterations. PEAD had a variety of chromosomal alterations, including two cases with RICTOR amplification. PD-L1 expression (20%, 50% and 80% of tumor cells) was limited to three PEAD samples, only. In conclusion, we provide a detailed insight into the molecular alterations across and within the different subtypes of pulmonary adenocarcinomas with intestinal differentiation.

It is well-known that tumor microenvironment plays a key role in the efficacy of various immunotherapies such as DC vaccine. Accordingly, the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) on DCs, which interacts with PD-1 on T cells, leads to inhibition of anti-tumor responses following presentation of tumor antigens by DCs to T cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that down-regulation of PD-L1 in DCs in association with silencing of PD-1 on T cells may lead to the enhancement of T-cell priming by DCs to have efficient anti-tumor T-cell responses. In this study, we silenced the expression of PD-L1 in DCs and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) in T cells by small interfering RNA (siRNA) -loaded chitosan-dextran sulfate nanoparticles (NPs) and evaluated the DC phenotypic and functional characteristics and T-cell functions following tumor antigen recognition on DCs, ex vivo. Our results showed that synthesized NPs had good physicochemical characteristics (size 77· nm and zeta potential of 14·3) that were associated with efficient cellular uptake and target gene silencing. Moreover, PD-L1 silencing was associated with stimulatory characteristics of DCs. On the other hand, presentation of tumor antigens by PD-L1-negative DCs to PD-1-silenced T cells led to induction of potent T-cell responses. Our findings imply that PD-L1-silenced DCs can be considered as a potent immunotherapeutic approach in combination with PD-1-siRNA loaded NPs, however; further in vivo investigation is required in animal models.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612019>Different responses to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)  in a patient with Lynch syndrome and metachronous urothelial and colon cancer: A case report.</a></h2><p>Lynch syndrome (LS), as a result of the germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, is characterized by the increased risk of endometrium, colon, and urinary tract cancer.

An Internet panel survey was conducted during March 27-April 8, 2019, among women aged 18-49 years who reported being pregnant any time since August 1, 2018. Influenza vaccination before or during pregnancy was assessed among respondents with known influenza vaccination status who were pregnant any time during October 2018-January 2019 (2,097). Tdap receipt during pregnancy was assessed among respondents with known Tdap status who reported a live birth by their survey date (817).From 2010-11 to 2017-18, pregnant women accounted for 24%-34% of influenza-associated hospitalizations per season among females aged 15-44 years. From 2010 to 2017, a total of 3,928 pertussis-related hospitalizations were reported among infants aged <2 months (annual range = 262-743). Maternal influenza and Tdap vaccination coverage rates reported as of April 2019 were 53.7% and 54.9%, respectively. Among women whose health care providers offered vaccination or provided referrals, 65.7% received influenza vaccine and 70.% received Tdap. The most commonly reported reasons for nonvaccination were believing the vaccine is not effective (influenza; 17.6%) and not knowing that vaccination is needed during each pregnancy (Tdap; 37.9%), followed by safety concerns for the infant (influenza =15.9%; Tdap = 17.1%).Many pregnant women do not receive the vaccines recommended to protect themselves and their infants, even when vaccination is offered. CDC and provider organizations' resources are available to help providers convey strong, specific recommendations for influenza and Tdap vaccination that are responsive to pregnant women's concerns.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605820>Patient-Reported Neuropsychiatric Outcomes of Long-Term Survivors after Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T Cell Therapy.</a></h2><p>CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor modified T-cell  (CAR-T cell therapy) is a novel treatment with promising results in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoid malignancies. CAR-T cell therapy has known early toxicities of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, but little is known about long-term neuropsychiatric adverse effects. We have utilized patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including PROMIS® measures, to assess neuropsychiatric and other patient-reported outcomes of 40 patients with relapse/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), one to five years after treatment with CD19-targeted CAR-T cells. Mean T scores of PROMIS domains of Global Mental health, Global Physical Health, Social Function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain and sleep disturbance were not clinically meaningfully different from the mean in the general US population. However, 19 patients (47.%) reported at least one cognitive difficulty and/or clinically meaningful depression and/or anxiety, and 7 patients (17.%) scored ≤ 40 in Global Mental Health, indicating at least one standard deviation worse than the general population mean. Younger age was associated with worse long-term Global Mental Health (p=0.02), anxiety (p=0.001) and depression (p=0.01). Anxiety prior to CAR-T cell therapy was associated with increased likelihood of anxiety after CAR-T cell therapy (p=0.001). 15 patients (37.%) reported cognitive difficulties post CAR-T cell therapy. Depression prior to CAR-T cell therapy was statistically significantly associated with higher likelihood of self-reported post CAR-T cognitive difficulties (p=0.02) and there was a trend for association between acute neurotoxicity and self-reported post-CAR-T cognitive difficulties (p=0.08). Having more post-CAR-T cognitive difficulties was associated with worse Global Mental Health and Global Physical Health. Our study demonstrates overall good neuropsychiatric outcomes in 40 long-term survivors after CAR-T cell therapy. However, nearly 50% of patients in the cohort reported at least one clinically meaningful negative neuropsychiatric outcome (anxiety, depression or cognitive difficulty), indicating that there is a significant number of patients who would likely benefit from mental health services following CAR-T cell therapy. Younger age, pre-CAR-T anxiety or depression, and acute neurotoxicity may be risk factors for long-term neuropsychiatric problems in this patient population. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2019.

We examined whether this ligand is a prognostic marker for high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and whether it is associated with accumulation of immune cells in the tumor. Serum s-CD95L levels in 51 patients with advanced ovarian cancer were tested by ELISA. IHC staining of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD163, CD31, FoxP3, CCR6, IL-17, Granzyme B, PD-L1, and membrane CD95L was used to assess tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Although the intensity of CD3, CD8, CD4, CD20, and CD163 in tumor tissues remained constant regardless of membrane CD95L expression, tumors in patients with HGSOC with s-CD95L levels ≥516 pg/mL showed increased infiltration by CD3 T cells ( = 0.001), comprising both cytotoxic CD8 ( = 0.01) and CD4 ( = 0.0062) cells including FoxP3 regulatory T cells ( = 0.0044). Also, the number of tumor-infiltrating CD20 B cells ( = 0.0094) increased in these patients. Multivariate analyses revealed that low s-CD95L concentrations [<516 pg/mL, HR, 3.54; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-11.11), and <1,200 activated CD8 (Granzyme B) cells (HR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.16-.95) were independent poor prognostic factors for recurrence, whereas >6,000 CD3 cells (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.15-0.79) was a good prognostic factor. Thus, low levels of s-CD95L (<516 pg/mL) are correlated with lower numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD3 and CD8, and also CD4 and FoxP3 T cells) in advanced HGSOC and are a poor prognostic marker. IMPLICATIONS: Serum s-CD95L is correlated with a number of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in HGSOC and could be used as a noninvasive marker of tumor immune infiltration to select patients referred for  trials that evaluate checkpoint inhibitor treatment.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570234>First-in-Human Intravenous Seprehvir in Young Cancer Patients: A Phase 1 Clinical Trial.</a></h2><p>Seprehvir (HSV1716) is an oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) previously demonstrated to be well tolerated in pediatric patients when administered intratumorally. To determine the safety of administering Seprehvir systemically, we conducted the first-in-human phase I trial of intravenous injection in young patients with relapsed or refractory extra-cranial solid cancers. We delivered a single dose of  × 10 infectious units (iu)/kg (maximum dose of 2 × 10) or 2. × 10 iu/kg (maximum dose of 1 × 10 iu) of Seprehvir via the peripheral vein, monitored adverse events, and measured tumor responses by imaging. We monitored HSV-1 serology as well as viremia and shedding by PCR and culture. We administered a single dose of Seprehvir to seven patients and multiple doses to two patients. We did not observe any dose-limiting toxicities. All five HSV-1 seronegative patients seroconverted by day 28. Four of nine patients had detectable HSV-1 genomes in peripheral blood appearing on day +4 consistent with de novo virus replication. Two patients had stable disease in response to Seprehvir. Intravenous Seprehvir is well tolerated without viral shedding in children and young adults with late-stage cancer.

Additionally, it has supported the use of  as a modality and pillar of cancer treatment. The interdisciplinary team plays an integral role in facilitating patients' understanding of their treatment modality, symptom management, and guidance through their cancer journey. As more research continues in various tumor types to understand how immune-modulated agents can impact tumor burden, disease control, and quality of life, it is hoped that more patients will have access to these therapies.Patient safety is paramount and nurses are aligned to educate, assess, and guide patients during immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

However, the key protein gasdermin E (GSDME, translated by the  gene) during the caspase-3-mediated pyroptosis process is absent in most tumor cells because of the hypermethylation of  (deafness autosomal dominant ) gene. Here, we develop a strategy of combining decitabine (DAC) with chemotherapy nanodrugs to trigger pyroptosis of tumor cells by epigenetics, further enhancing the immunological effect of chemotherapy. DAC is pre-performed with specific tumor-bearing mice for demethylation of the  gene in tumor cells. Subsequently, a commonly used tumor-targeting nanoliposome loaded with cisplatin (LipoDDP) is used to administrate drugs for activating the caspase-3 pathway in tumor cells and trigger pyroptosis. Experiments demonstrate that the reversal of GSDME silencing in tumor cells is achieved and facilitates the occurrence of pyroptosis. According to the anti-tumor activities, anti-metastasis results, and inhibition of recurrence, this pyroptosis-based chemotherapy strategy enhances immunological effects of chemotherapy and also provides an important insight into tumor .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534106>[INVESTIGATION OF SUBCUTANEOUS  FOR ALLERGIC RHINITIS IN OUR HOSPITAL FOR THE PAST 17 YEARS].</a></h2><p>Recently, subcutaneous  (SCIT) has not been performed very much in our country. We investigated SCIT for allergic rhinitis in our hospital for the past 17 years.Subjects were 188 cases who started SCIT by rush method under hospitalization. We investigated the patient background, laboratory findings, side reactions from their medical records and carried out questionnaire survey about effects and satisfaction to patients and their guardians.The median age at start was 10 years 4 months. Cedar pollen was the most common allergen used in treatment followed by mite, and two or more allergens were used in 85% patients. Five percent of patients dropped out. Medication score decreased significantly after SCIT, and 45% had become free from medication. Systemic adverse reaction was observed in 117 of the ,954 injections (2%) during the rapid phase and in 10 of the ,567 injections (0.2%) during the maintenance phase, and all episodes disappeared immediately. Symptom score significantly decreased after SCIT, the effects being similar even after 3 years of cessation of SCIT.SCIT was effective for allergic rhinitis in childhood.

This study aimed to examine factors, such as temperature and storage buffer composition, that affect the stability of allergen extracts from pollens of allergenic importance in Korea.We prepared four pollen allergen extracts from ragweed, mugwort, Japanese hop, and sawtooth oak, which are the most important causes of seasonal rhinitis in Korea. Changes of protein and major allergen concentration were measured over 1 year by Bradford assay, two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after reconstitution of the lyophilized allergen extract in various buffers and stored at room temperature (RT, 18°C to 26°C) or refrigerated (4°C).More than 90% of the original protein concentration in all four extracts examined was detected over 1 year when 50% glycerol was added and refrigerated, whereas 57.9% to 94.% remained in the extracts at RT. The addition of 50% glycerol to the storage buffer was found to prevent protein degradation at RT. Amb a 1, a major allergen of ragweed, was almost completely degraded in 9 weeks at RT when reconstituted in a buffer without 50% glycerol. However, 55.6% to 92.8% of Amb a 1 content was detected after 1 year of incubation at 4°C in all buffer conditions except 0.3% phenol.Addition of 50% glycerol as well as refrigeration was found to be important in increasing the shelf-life of allergen extracts from pollens of allergenic importance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534890>Sinonasal Melanoma: A Single Institutional Analysis and Future Directions.</a></h2><p>  Sinonasal melanoma is a rare disease with a high mortality rate.

Stem cell-based  has been recognized as a crucial immunoregulatory regimen in various preclinical and clinical studies. Despite initial therapeutic outcomes, conventional stem cells face key limitations. The novel Cymerus™ manufacturing facilitates production of a virtually limitless supply of consistent human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived mesenchymal stem cells, which could play a key role in selective immunosuppression and graft repair during rejection.Here, we demonstrated the impact of iPSC-derived human MSCs on the development of immune tolerance and long-term graft survival in mouse orthotopic airway allografts. BALB/c → C57BL/6 allografts were reconstituted with iPSC-derived MSCs (2 million/transplant/at d0), and allografts were examined for regulatory T cells (Tregs), oxygenation, microvascular blood flow, airway epithelium, and collagen deposition during rejection.We demonstrated that iPSC-derived MSC treatment leads to significant increases in hTSG-6 protein, followed by an upregulation of mouse Tregs and IL-, IL-10, and IL-15 cytokines, which augments graft microvascular blood flow and oxygenation, and thereby maintained a healthy airway epithelium and prevented the subepithelial deposition of collagen at d90 post transplantation.Collectively, these data confirmed that iPSC-derived MSC-mediated immunosuppression has potential to establish immune tolerance and rescue allograft from sustained hypoxic/ischemic phase, and subsequently limits long-term airway epithelial injury and collagen progression, which therapeutically warrant a study of Cymerus iPSC-derived MSCs as a potential management option for immunosuppression in transplant recipients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31538703>Changing practice patterns of adjuvant radiation among elderly women with early stage breast cancer in the United States from 2004 to 2014.</a></h2><p>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have challenged the need for routine radiation therapy (RT) in women ≥ age 70 with favorable early stage breast cancer (BC) due to modest improvement in local control and no survival benefit.

Additional strategies are necessary to improve these agents' efficacy.Patients with stable disease for at least 4 months on TKI or checkpoint inhibitors were included. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) was delivered to an organ with comparable lesions, where one lesion was in the treatment target and the other one was intentionally left untreated (control lesion). Response in both lesions was scored using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors V.1.1 criteria 2 months after completion of SBRT. The primary endpoint was the rate of SBRT adverse events, and the secondary endpoints included the rate of reduction in target lesion size.17 patients were enrolled (14 men and 3 women, median age: 54. years old). SBRT was delivered to the lungs (n=), bones (n=4), lymph nodes (n=4), liver (n=1), primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (n=1) and locally recurrent RCC (n=2). The equivalent dose in 2 Gy with an alpha to beta ratio of 2.6 was 114 Gy. With a median follow-up of 8 months, the cumulative rate of SBRT-related toxicity (grade 1) was 12% (n=2), consisting of oesophagitis and skin erythema. No grade 2 or higher toxicity was detected. Radiographic response in the target lesion was seen in 13 patients (76%), with complete response in  (29%) patients and partial response in 8 (47%), including abscopal effect in 1 patient. Control lesions remained stable in 16 patients. The difference between response in the target and control lesions as judged by the mean sizes of these lesions before and at 2 months after SBRT was statistically significant (p<0.01). Fraction size of 10 Gy or greater was associated with complete response (p<0.01).Extracranial SBRT in patients with mRCC treated with TKI or checkpoint inhibitors is well tolerated and could be effective..© Author (s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Prevalence of SAI with  is more frequent with combined therapy (8% vs 4 to 10% with CTLA4 blocking antibody and 1% with PD1 blocking antibody). Although hypophysitis are more frequently observed with CTLA4 blocking antibody, some cases of Isolated SAI have been reported in patients treated by PD1 blocking antibody. SAI could be transient, requiring long-term monitoring. The use of opioid analgesics is increasing in many countries, thus becoming a public health problem. Prevalence of opioid-related SAI is unclear but recent prospective studies reveal a prevalence between  and 20%. The main risk factor to develop this pathology is morphine-equivalent daily dose. Diagnosis relies on 8.00 am plasma cortisol measurement and cortisol increase after Synacthen administration. Recent cortisol immuno-assays, in agreement with mass spectrometry, give lower reference values, encouraging reevaluation of the current cut-off of 500 nmol/L. New modified-release hydrocortisone preparations have been recently developed to better mimic the physiological cortisol rhythm and to improve compliance in adrenocortical deficient patients. Nowadays, continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion seems to be a unique replacement therapy allowing adequate circadian biorhythm but should be restricted to specific patients due to the complexity of this substituting strategy. © 2019 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Pneumonitis was defined as the onset of new pulmonary symptoms with characteristic imaging findings during or after a patient's first course of  that could not be readily explained as infection or a progression of malignancy. It was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.A total of 187 patients were included. A diagnosis of asthma was found in the records of 26 cases (13.9%). Pneumonitis was found in 10 cases (.35%); 50% were grade 2 and 50% were grade 3-4. Two of the grade 3-4 cases (40%) occurred in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Three patients with asthma developed pneumonitis (11.% of patients with asthma), all grade 3-4. Only 28.6% of the non-asthma-pneumonitis cases were grade 3-4. All (100%) of the asthma-pneumonitis patients were former smokers, while 71.4% of the non-asthma-pneumonitis patients were former smokers.A history of asthma may be associated with a higher grade of pneumonitis if it develops, and a history of smoking may augment this relationship.© 2019 S.

In addition, the co-expression of its receptor in tumours has been demonstrated, mediating tumour cell proliferation. Although CD70 expression is a prerequisite to enrol patients in solid tumour clinical trials using anti-CD70 , there is currently no standardised test to evaluate CD70 expression. These differences in immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocols make it challenging to compare the expression levels that were obtained in different studies, pointing out the need for one uniform methodology. In this retrospective study, over 600 tumour samples from different solid and haematological malignancies were analysed while using one validated IHC method. CD70 and CD27 expression was demonstrated in a broad range of tumour types. In solid tumours, 43% demonstrated CD70 positivity with the highest degree in renal cell carcinoma (79.%). Kaposi sarcoma showed no CD70 expression on the tumour cells. In lymphoma samples, 58% demonstrated CD70 positivity. Moreover, the co-expression of CD70 and CD27 was observed in 39% of lymphoma samples. These findings highlight the need to further explore anti-CD70 therapies in a broad range of CD70 expressing tumour types and in doing so, implementing one standardised protocol to define CD70 overexpression to use it as a diagnostic tool.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661153> in Colorectal Cancer.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer deaths, with only 15% of patients surviving  years in the metastatic setting. Recent exciting developments in cancer , which involves priming the host's natural immune defenses to recognize, target, and destroy cancer cells effectively, have brought some glimpse of hope in fighting this deadly disease. Although CRC has been shown to evade immune detection like many other cancers do,  has been noted to produce some very impressive results in a select group of patients.

Tumor-infiltrating CD8-positive (CD8+) T lymphocytes play a central role in anti-tumor immune responses. Non-invasive imaging of CD8+ T cells may provide new insights into the mechanisms of  and potentially predict treatment response. We are studying the safety and utility of Zr-IAB22M2C, a radiolabeled minibody against CD8+ T cells, for targeted imaging of CD8+ T cells in patients with cancer.  The intial dose escalation phase of this first-in-human prospective study included 6 patients (melanoma, 1; lung, 4; HCC, 1). Patients received approximately 111 MBq (3 mCi) of Zr-IAB22M2C (at minibody mass doses of 0.2, 0., 1.0, 1., , or 10 mg) as a single dose, followed by PET/CT scans at ~1-2, 6-8, 24, 48, and 96-144 h post-injection (p.i.). Biodistribution in normal organs, lymph nodes, and lesions was evaluated. In addition, serum samples were obtained at ~, 30, and 60 min and later at the times of imaging. Patients were monitored for safety during infusion and up to the last imaging time point.  Zr-IAB22M2C infusion was well tolerated with no immediate or delayed side effects observed after injection. Serum clearance was typically bi-exponential and dependent on the mass of minibody administered. Areas under the serum time-activity curve normalized to administered activity ranged from 1.3 h/l for 0.2 mg to 8.9 h/l for 10 mg. Biodistribution was dependent on the minibody mass administered. The highest uptake was always seen in spleen, followed by bone marrow. Liver uptake was more pronounced with higher minibody masses. Kidney uptake was typically low. Prominent uptake was seen in multiple normal lymph nodes as early as 2 h p.i., reaching peak levels by 24-48 h p.i. Uptake in tumor lesions was seen on imaging as early as 2 h p.i., with a majority of Zr-IAB22M2C-positive lesions detectable by 24 h. Lesions were visualized early in patients receiving treatment, with SUV ranging from .85-22.8 in 6 target lesions.  Zr-IAB22M2C imaging is safe and has favorable kinetics for early imaging. Biodistribution suggests successful targeting of CD8+ T cell-rich tissues. The observed targeting of tumor lesions suggests this may be informative for CD8+ T cell accumulation within tumors.

Advanced breast cancer with distant organ metastases is considered incurable with currently available therapies. On the molecular level, breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease; molecular features include activation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, encoded by ERBB2), activation of hormone receptors (oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) and/or BRCA mutations. Treatment strategies differ according to molecular subtype. Management of breast cancer is multidisciplinary; it includes locoregional (surgery and radiation therapy) and systemic therapy approaches. Systemic therapies include endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive disease, chemotherapy, anti-HER2 therapy for HER2-positive disease, bone stabilizing agents, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for BRCA mutation carriers and, quite recently, . Future therapeutic concepts in breast cancer aim at individualization of therapy as well as at treatment de-escalation and escalation based on tumour biology and early therapy response.

Recently, we demonstrated that glycan structures of serum α-acid glycoprotein (AGP) changed dramatically in cancer patients and that α1,3fucosylated AGP (fAGP) levels increased along with disease progression and decreased responding to chemotherapy treatments. Here, the fAGP was analyzed in sera prospectively obtained from 39 patients with advanced lung cancer who underwent  with anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumab. Twenty-three patients had significantly high fAGP levels above the cut-off value (H-fAGP) at one month after starting the treatment and 20 patients in this group, whose tumor sizes did not decrease, maintained high fAGP levels continuously and subsequently died. However, the other 16 patients, whose fAGP levels decreased or maintained below the cut-off value (L-fAGP), survived during a 2-year observation even though  patients in this group had no tumor shrinkage. Accordingly, the overall survival rate was found to significantly correlate with the fAGP level. Multivariate analyses revealed that the H-fAGP was an independent risk factor for cancer progression. Therefore, the fAGP level appeared to be a reliable biomarker for predicting clinical efficacy of  with nivolumab.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546795>Long Non-Coding RNAs as Molecular Signatures for Canine B-Cell Lymphoma Characterization.</a></h2><p>Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and follicular lymphoma (FL) are the most common B-cell lymphomas (BCL) in dogs. Recent investigations have demonstrated overlaps of these histotypes with the human counterparts, including clinical presentation, biologic behavior, tumor genetics, and treatment response. The molecular mechanisms that underlie canine BCL are still unknown and new studies to improve diagnosis, therapy, and the utilization of canine species as spontaneous animal tumor models are undeniably needed. Recent work using human DLBCL transcriptomes has suggested that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a key role in lymphoma pathogenesis and pinpointed a restricted number of lncRNAs as potential targets for further studies.To expand the knowledge of non-coding molecules involved in canine BCL, we used transcriptomes obtained from a cohort of 62 dogs with newly-diagnosed multicentric DLBCL, MZL and FL that had undergone complete staging work-up and were treated with chemotherapy or chemo-. We developed a customized R pipeline performing a transcriptome assembly by multiple algorithms to uncover novel lncRNAs, and delineate genome-wide expression of unannotated and annotated lncRNAs. Our pipeline also included a new package for high performance system biology analysis, which detects high-scoring network biological neighborhoods to identify functional modules. Moreover, our customized pipeline quantified the expression of novel and annotated lncRNAs, allowing us to subtype DLBCLs into two main groups. The DLBCL subtypes showed statistically different survivals, indicating the potential use of lncRNAs as prognostic biomarkers in future studies.In this manuscript, we describe the methodology used to identify lncRNAs that differentiate B-cell lymphoma subtypes and we interpreted the biological and clinical values of the results. We inferred the potential functions of lncRNAs to obtain a comprehensive and integrative insight that highlights their impact in this neoplasm.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622283>Vaccination Coverage with Selected Vaccines and Exemption Rates Among Children in Kindergarten - United States, 2018-19 School Year.</a></h2><p>State and local school vaccination requirements exist to ensure that students are protected against vaccine-preventable diseases (1).

Building on previous analyses (2) and using the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) global vaccination coverage estimates as of 2018, this report presents global, regional, and national vaccination coverage estimates and trends, including vaccination dropout rates. According to these estimates, global coverage with the first dose of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis-containing vaccine (DTP1) remained relatively unchanged from 2010 (89%) to 2018 (90%). Global coverage with the third DTP dose (DTP3) followed a similar global trend to that of DTP1, remaining relatively consistent from 2010 (84%) to 2018 (86%) (3). Globally, 19.4 million children (14%) were not fully vaccinated in 2018, and among them, 13. million (70%) did not receive any DTP doses. Overall, dropout rates from DTP1 to DTP3 decreased globally from 6% in 2010 to 4% in 2018. Global coverage with the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) remained between 84% and 86% during 2010-2018. Among countries that offer a second MCV dose (MCV2) during the second year of life, coverage increased from 19% in 2007 to 54% in 2018; among countries offering MCV2 to older age groups (children aged 3-14 years), coverage also increased, from 36% in 2007 to 69% in 2018 (3). Globally, the estimated difference in coverage with MCV1 and MCV2 in 2018 was 17%. However, among new and underused vaccines, global coverage increased from 2007 to 2018 for completed series of rotavirus vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), rubella vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib), and hepatitis B vaccine (HepB). To reach global vaccination coverage goals for vaccines recommended during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, tailored strategies that address local determinants for incomplete vaccination are needed, including targeting hard-to-reach and hard-to-vaccinate populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639500>Progress and Prospects of Recurrent Glioma: A Recent Scientometric Analysis of the Web of Science in 2019.</a></h2><p>Most glioma patients experience recurrence and have a poor prognosis.

The top-cited articles consisted of 98 articles and 2 literature reviews. Articles were classified into 4 major categories based on subject matter: 82 pertained to treatment, 6 pertained to genetic mechanisms, 7 pertained to diagnosis, and  pertained to prognosis. Treatment-related articles were subdivided into the following 7 categories: targeted therapy (21), chemotherapy (20),  (12), combination therapy (12), radiotherapy (9), surgical resection (6), a new therapy (physiotherapy) (1), and treatment summary (1).The results of the analysis indicated that the core problem is the treatment of recurrent glioma. Although the number of citations on targeted therapy and combination therapy has increased in recent years, the proportion of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), basic medical research, literature reviews and meta-analyses is relatively low; thus, there is an urgent need to conduct these types of studies on recurrent glioma.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, its natural history is not well defined and treatment recommendations come from small retrospective studies. Data on managing PTFL with radiation therapy alone is particularly sparse. Here, we describe a 17 year-old male who presented in June 2017 with a slowly enlarging right-sided cervical neck mass. An initial core biopsy was performed which showed reactive follicular hyperplasia. Four months later, the mass had enlarged significantly and an excision biopsy again showed reactive follicular hyperplasia. Further excision of five cervical lymph-nodes revealed expanded follicles with attenuated mantle-zones. Follicles were composed of medium sized atypical lymphoid cells; centroblasts were increased. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated follicles with cells expressing CD20, CD10, PAX-, OCT-2, BOB-1 and BCL-6; Cyclin D1 was negative. MIB-1 was greater than 90% in follicles. Polymerase chain reaction analysis identified a clonal B-cell profile. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization did not detect t(14;18), BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangement and breaks in IRF-4/DUSP22 and MYC were not detected. These findings were in keeping with a diagnosis of PTFL. PET/CT imaging confirmed disease isolated to the right neck, but unfortunately unresectable due to anatomic location. The patient declined treatment with chemo- and was thus treated with local radiotherapy, which was well tolerated. He achieved a complete response and remains in remission six months later. In our experience, radiation therapy is a suitable treatment for PTFL when excision and/or CIT is not possible.This article is protected by copyright.

It is an overwhelming task to discover drug-like inhibitors of glycosyl transferases that block the synthesis of specific branching processes in cancer cells, killing tumor cells selectively. It has long been known that -glycan biosynthesis can be inhibited by disruption of the first committed enzyme, dolichyl-phosphate -acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase 1 (DPAGT1). Selective DPAGT1 inhibitors have the promising therapeutic potential for certain solid cancers that require increased branching of -linked glycans in their growth progressions. Recently, we discovered that an anti- molecule, aminouridyl phenoxypiperidinbenzyl butanamide (APPB) showed DPAGT1 inhibitory activity with the IC value of 0.25 μM. It was confirmed that APPB inhibits -glycosylation of β-catenin at 2. nM concentration. A sharp difference between APPB and tunicamycin was that the hemolytic activity of APPB is significantly attenuated (IC > 200 μM RBC). Water solubility of APPB is >350-times greater than that of tunicamycin (78.8 mg/mL for APPB, <0.2 mg/mL for tunicamycin). A novel DPAGT1 inhibitor, APPB selectively inhibits growth of the solid tumors (. KB, LoVo, SK-OV-3, MDA-MB-432S, HCT116, Panc-1, and AsPC-1) at low μM concentrations, but does not inhibit growth of a leukemia cell (L1210) and the healthy cells (Vero and HPNE) at these concentrations.  metabolic stability using rat liver microsomes indicated that a half-life ( ) of APPB is sufficiently long (>60 min) for  studies (PK/PD, safety profiles, and  efficacy) using animal models. We have refined all steps in the previously reported synthesis for APPB for larger-scale.

The ineffectiveness of treatment is partly because of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which comprises tumor-supportive pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed to tackle both the immunosuppressive PSC and pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs). Recently, physical cold atmospheric plasma consisting of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species has emerged as a novel treatment option for cancer. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of plasma-treated phosphate-buffered saline (pPBS) using three PSC lines and four PCC lines and examined the immunogenicity of the induced cell death. We observed a decrease in the viability of PSC and PCC after pPBS treatment, with a higher efficacy in the latter. Two PCC lines expressed and released damage-associated molecular patterns characteristic of the induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD). In addition, pPBS-treated PCC were highly phagocytosed by dendritic cells (DCs), resulting in the maturation of DC. This indicates the high potential of pPBS to trigger ICD. In contrast, pPBS induced no ICD in PSC. In general, pPBS treatment of PCCs and PSCs created a more immunostimulatory secretion profile (higher TNF-α and IFN-γ, lower TGF-β) in coculture with DC. Altogether, these data show that plasma treatment via pPBS has the potential to induce ICD in PCCs and to reduce the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment created by PSCs. Therefore, these data provide a strong experimental basis for further in vivo validation, which might potentially open the way for more successful combination strategies with  for PDAC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555516>The association of PD-L1 expression with the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1  and survival of non-small cell lung cancer patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</a></h2><p>We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) monotherapy or  combined with chemotherapy and further estimated the value of PD-L1 expression in predicting the response from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy.Clinical trial data were searched from electronic databases, which evaluated PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and correlated with PD-L1 expression levels.Fifteen randomized-controlled trials involving 10,074 patients were identified. Comparing anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy to chemotherapy, the pooled HR for overall survival (OS) was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.69-0.85, P<0.00001). Subgroup analyses revealed that patients had longer OS at ≥1%, ≥%, ≥10% and ≥50% PD-L1 expression levels. Patients with higher PD-L1 expression may get increased benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Moreover, patients with PD-L1 ≥50% had an objective response rate (ORR) improvement from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (RR =1.87, 95% CI: 1.27-2.75, P=0.001), but no ORR benefits were observed in patients with PD-L1 expression <1% (RR =0.82, 95% CI: 0.56-1.22, P=0.33) or 1-49% (RR =0.80, 95% CI: 0.64-0.98, P=0.03). OS was significantly better in patients receiving second-or-third line treatments (P<0.00001) with PD-L1 ≥1%. The efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors was similar to that of PD-L1 inhibitors, with no significant difference (P=0.63, I=0%). Furthermore,  combined with chemotherapy had better OS (HR =0.64, 95% CI: 0.48-0.84, P=0.001) than chemotherapy alone. Subgroup analyses showed that patients benefited from the combined chemo-IO treatment in the first-line setting regardless of PD-L1 expression level.PD-L1 expression may be a valuable predictor of the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy in certain NSCLC patients. However, the combination of chemotherapy plus  significantly improved survival regardless of the PD-L1 expression level in the first-line treatment of NSCLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555258>Regulatory T Cells Control the Switch From  to Invasive Breast Cancer.</a></h2><p>Ductal carcinoma  (DCIS) is a non-obligate precursor of breast cancer, and it only progresses to invasive breast cancer in around 40% of patients. While immune infiltrates have been observed in these early cancer lesions, their potential prognostic value is still unclear. Regulatory T (Treg) cells accumulate in advanced breast cancers, and predict poor outcome. We have shown before that ablation of Treg cells in established tumors leads to significant decrease in primary and metastatic tumor burden. In this work, we sought to investigate Treg cell function in the progression from non-invasive to invasive breast cancer lesions. To this end, we used the murine mammary tumor virus polyoma middle T (MMTV-PyMT) murine model of spontaneous, stage-wise breast carcinogenesis crossed to Foxp3  knock in mice, allowing Treg cell ablation by administration of diphtheria toxin. Transient targeting of Treg cells at the  carcinoma stage resulted in a significant increase in the number of tumor-bearing mammary glands and size of growing tumors compared with control mice. Whole mammary gland mounts and histological examination confirmed larger emergent tumor area in Treg cell-ablated mice, and revealed that these tumors were characterized by a more advanced tumor staging, with presence of early invasion, increased desmoplasia and collagen deposition. Furthermore, Treg cell ablation increased the percentage of cancer stem/progenitor cells in the mammary compartment. Interestingly, Treg cell ablation resulted in increased inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL- with a concomitant reduction in classically activated tumor associated macrophages. This TH2-biased immune regulatory mammary inflammation was consistent with the enhancement in tumor promotion that we observed. Overall, our study demonstrates that Treg cells oppose breast cancer progression at early stages, raising a cautionary note regarding the consideration of immune intervention targeted at boosting immune responses for DCIS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650415>Metachronous rectal metastasis from pulmonary adenocarcinoma after 11 years of chemo-, immuno-, and radiotherapy for recurrent lesions: a case report.</a></h2><p>Rectal metastasis from pulmonary adenocarcinoma is rare, and it has been regarded as an end-stage phenomenon. Recently, however, advances in lung cancer treatment have improved the chance of long-term survival of patients with unresectable distant metastases. We describe the occurrence and management of metastatic spread of a pulmonary carcinoma to the rectum.The patient was a 79-year-old woman who had undergone thoracoscopic left lobectomy for pulmonary adenocarcinoma and then, over the next 11 years, various drugs (carboplatin + paclitaxel (as adjuvant therapy), gefitinib, gemcitabine + vinorelbine, S1 (an oral -fluorouracil-based drug), carboplatin + pemetrexed + bevacizumab, erlotinib, nivolumab, afatinib, and carboplatin+ S1) were administered, especially for hilar and mediastinal lymph node recurrences. During the eleventh postoperative year, left and right iliac bone metastases were detected, and radiation therapy was undertaken for local control of these lesions. When F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography was performed for evaluation of the disease, tracer accumulation in the upper rectum was seen. Colonoscopic examination of the rectum revealed an intramural mass with central ulceration, and the mass was diagnosed histologically as an adenocarcinoma. The bone metastases appeared to be controlled, and the patient's performance status was good, but she had suffered constipation for about a year and desired treatment. Thus, laparoscopic low anterior resection was performed. Histopathologic analysis revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma existing mainly between the submucosa and serosa, and immunohistochemical analysis showed the tumor to be positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7, negative for CK20, positive for thyroid transcription factor-1, and negative for special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 and caudal type homeobox 2, confirming the diagnosis of rectal metastasis from the primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma. The patient recovered well without any change in her functional status. Systemic chemotherapy was resumed, and she continues to do well, now 6 months after surgery.Surgery may be a good option for the management of an isolated rectal metastasis from pulmonary cancer in patients whose functional status is good.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562797>Five-Year Survival with Combined Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Advanced Melanoma.</a></h2><p>Nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab alone resulted in longer progression-free and overall survival than ipilimumab alone in a trial involving patients with advanced melanoma. We now report -year outcomes in the trial.We randomly assigned patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma to receive one of the following regimens: nivolumab (at a dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight) plus ipilimumab (3 mg per kilogram) every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab (3 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks); nivolumab (3 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks) plus ipilimumab-matched placebo; or ipilimumab (3 mg per kilogram every 3 weeks for four doses) plus nivolumab-matched placebo. The two primary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and in the nivolumab group, as compared with the ipilimumab group.At a minimum follow-up of 60 months, the median overall survival was more than 60.0 months (median not reached) in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and 36.9 months in the nivolumab group, as compared with 19.9 months in the ipilimumab group (hazard ratio for death with nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs. ipilimumab, 0.52; hazard ratio for death with nivolumab vs. ipilimumab, 0.63). Overall survival at  years was 52% in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and 44% in the nivolumab group, as compared with 26% in the ipilimumab group. No sustained deterioration of health-related quality of life was observed during or after treatment with nivolumab plus ipilimumab or with nivolumab alone. No new late toxic effects were noted.Among patients with advanced melanoma, sustained long-term overall survival at  years was observed in a greater percentage of patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab alone than in those who received ipilimumab alone, with no apparent loss of quality of life in the patients who received regimens containing nivolumab.

We provide recommendations for improving access and receipt of linked datasets involving Australian Government-administered data.We describe requirements for linking eleven federal and state data sources to establish a national linked dataset for safety evaluation of vaccines. The required data linkage methodology for integrating cross-jurisdictional data sources is also described.Extensive negotiation was required with 18 different agencies for 21 separate authorisations and 12 ethics approvals. Three variations of the 'best practice' linkage model were implemented. Australian Government approval requests spanned nearly four years from initial request for data, with a further year before ACIR data transfer to the linkage agency.Integration of immunisation registers with other data collections is achievable in Australia but infeasible for routine and rapid identification of vaccine safety concerns. Lengthy authorisation requirements, convoluted disparate application processes and inconsistencies in data supplied all contribute to delayed data availability. Implications for public health: Delayed data access for safety surveillance prevents timely epidemiological reviews.

Radiographic progression was assessed by change in van der Heijde-modified total Sharp score (vdH-mTSS; mean of two readers). Statistical analysis used a linear mixed-effects model (random slope) at weeks 24 and 52, and observed data at week 52. Assessments at week 52 included additional efficacy endpoints (non-responders imputation and mixed-effects models for repeated measures) and safety.The majority (86.6%) of patients completed 52 weeks of treatment.

Surgical excision followed by periocular reconstruction is the primary method of treatment. In aggressive cases, radiation, topical chemotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy have been explored as adjuvant therapy. , through immune checkpoint inhibitors, has proven to have significant antitumor effect in many cancer types, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Little is known about endogenous immune response directed against sebaceous carcinoma. In this study, we aim to characterize the expression pattern of PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 in both sebaceous carcinoma and in infiltrating immune cells to explore the potential use of checkpoint blockade as therapy.We performed a retrospective chart and histology review of patients with sebaceous carcinoma between 1990 and 2017 at the University of Wisconsin. Tissue microarrays were made from paraffin blocks. Immunohistochemistry was performed for evaluation of tumor and immune cell infiltration for expression of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2. Tumor or infiltrating immune cells were considered positive if ≥% of cells had membranous (cell surface) expression.Twenty-eight patients were included. PD-L1 and PD-1 were not significantly expressed on tumor cells; however, PD-L1 and PD-1 were expressed on infiltrating immune cells in 46% and 25% of patients, respectively. In contrast, PD-L2 demonstrated positive expression on tumor cells in 46% of the cases along with positive expression on infiltrating immune cells in 38% of the cases.Sebaceous carcinoma currently has few effective adjuvant treatment options. The expression of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 on infiltrating immune cells and PD-L2 on tumor cells restrains T-cells from full activation and proliferation, therefore limiting the antitumor effect of T-cells, tipping the balance toward unopposed tumor progression. Consequently, PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors may have a role in sebaceous carcinoma treatment. Given the prevalence of PD-L2 expression in sebaceous carcinoma and the lack of PD-L2 blockade therapy available, PD-1 blockade may provide benefit over PD-L1 inhibitors. PD-1 blockade in combination with current methods may be a viable therapeutic option for patients with sebaceous carcinoma and deserves further study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547532>Current Possibilities of Gynecologic Cancer Treatment with the Use of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Despite the ongoing progress in cancer research, the global cancer burden has increased to 18.1 million new cases and 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Gynecological cancers, such as ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancers, considerably contribute to global cancer burden, leading to $,862.6, $2,945.7, and $1,543.9 million of annual costs of cancer care, respectively. Thus, the development of effective therapies against gynecological cancers is still a largely unmet medical need. One of the novel therapeutic approaches is to induce anti-cancer immunity by the inhibition of the immune checkpoint pathways using monoclonal antibodies. The molecular targets for monoclonal antibodies are cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). The rationale for the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with gynecological cancers was based on the immunohistological studies showing high expression levels of PD-1 and PD-L1 in those cancers. Currently available immune checkpoint inhibitors include nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, and ipilimumab. The efficacy and safety of these inhibitors, used as monotherapy and with combination with chemotherapy, is being currently evaluated in several clinical studies. As the results are promising, more clinical trials are being planned, which may lead to the development of efficient therapies for gynecological cancer patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642784>Allergen-specific  for inhalants allergens in children.</a></h2><p>Allergen-specific  (AIT) for aeroallergens consists of the administration of standardized allergen extracts to patients with respiratory IgE-mediated diseases to the same allergen in order to achieve immune tolerance to the allergen and prevent onset of symptoms. AIT is usually delivered by sublingual, subcutaneous route. Both sublingual  (SLIT) and subcutaneous  (SCIT) are given at increasing doses in the build-up phase and then at maintenance dose. The allergen dose is regularly administered throughout the year or pre/co-seasonally, depending on the causal allergen and the type of allergen extract. AIT with one or multiple allergens currently represents the only causal treatment able to change the natural history of allergic airways diseases (1). Significant progresses have been made in terms of AIT efficacy and safety since the first report of the treatment of hay-fever by SCIT using pollen extracts, described by Noon and Freeman in 1911 (2; 3). The first randomized study on SLIT dates back to 1986 (4). Several placebo-controlled studies on AIT in the subsequent years have allowed systematic reviews suggesting evidence for improvement of symptoms and reduction of medication use for both allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma (). However, AIT remains underused since interpretation of evidence remains challenging for heterogeneity among studied populations, selection of potential responders, outcomes, regimens and products for AIT. Moreover, the use of AIT is hampered by fluctuating availability of AIT products, different educational level of physicians and lack of consciousness of AIT in the general population (6).Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603733>Advances in Diagnosis and Multidisciplinary Management of Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: State of the Art.</a></h2><p>During the past decade and a half, the most common cause of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has shifted from tobacco and alcohol to the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV-driven p16-positive OPSCC and tobacco-related OPSCC differ in their underlying molecular and genetic profiles, socioeconomic demographics, and response to treatment. HPV-related OPSCC tends to occur in younger patients and has a significantly better response to treatment and excellent prognosis. The stark contrast in prognosis-with around 90% overall -year survival for HPV-related p16-positive OPSCC and 40% for non-HPV-related p16-negative OPSCC-has prompted major changes in the eighth edition of the staging manual of the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer). The past 10-15 years have also witnessed major advances in surgery, radiation therapy (RT), and systemic therapy. Minimally invasive surgery has come of age, with transoral robotic procedures and laser microsurgery. Intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) and more recently proton-beam RT have markedly improved the conformity of RT, with an ability to precisely target the cancer and cancer-bearing regions while sparing normal structures and significantly reducing long-term treatment-related morbidity. Progress in systemic therapy has come in the form of  and targeted agents such as cetuximab. Owing to the better prognosis of HPV-driven OPSCC as well as the morbidity associated with treatment, de-escalation of therapy via multiple strategies is being explored.

Although metastatic melanoma was reported to get benefits from , molecular mechanisms and immune microenviroment underlying the melanoma bone metastasis and prognostic factors are still unknown.  Gene expression profiling of 112 samples, including 104 primary melanomas and 8 bone metastatic melanomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, was assayed to construct a ceRNA network associated with bone metastases. Besides, we detected the fraction of 22 immune cell types in melanoma  the algorithm of "cell type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT)." Based on the significant ceRNAs or immune cells, we constructed nomograms to predict the prognosis of patients with melanoma. Ultimately, correlation analysis was implemented to discover the relationship between the significant ceRNA and immune cells to reveal the potential signaling pathways.  We constructed a ceRNA network based on the interaction among 8 pairs of long noncoding RNA-microRNA and 15 pairs of microRNA-mRNA. CIBERSORT and ceRNA integration analysis discovered that AL118506.1 has both significant prognostic value ( = 0.002) and high correlation with T follicular helper cells ( = 0.033). Meanwhile, T cells CD8 and macrophages M2 were negatively correlated ( < 0.001). Moreover, we constructed two satisfactory nomograms (area under curve of 3-year survival: 0.899; -year survival: 0.885; and concordance index: 0.780) with significant ceRNAs or immune cells, to predict the prognosis of patients.  In this study, we suggest that bone metastasis in melanoma might be related to AL118506.1 and its role in regulating thrombospondin 2 and T follicular helper cells. Two nomograms were constructed to predict the prognosis of patients with melanoma and demonstrated their value in improving the personalized management.Copyright © 2019 Huang, Zeng, Li, Song, Yan, Yin, Hu, Zhu, Chang, Zhang, Zhang, Meng and Huang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582519>Intratumoral delivery of plasmid interleukin-12 via electroporation leads to regression of injected and non-injected tumors in Merkel cell carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Interleukin-12 (IL-12) promotes adaptive type-1 immunity and has demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy, but systemic administration leads to severe adverse events (AEs), including death. This pilot trial investigated safety, efficacy, and immunologic activity of intratumoral delivery of IL-12 plasmid DNA (tavo) via in vivo electroporation (i.t.-tavo-EP) in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), an aggressive virus-associated skin cancer.Fifteen MCC patients with superficial injectable tumor(s) received i.t.-tavo-EP on days 1, , and 8 of each cycle. Patients with locoregional MCC (Cohort A, N=3) received one cycle before definitive surgery in week 4. Patients with metastatic MCC (Cohort B, N=12) received up to 4 cycles total, administered at least six weeks apart. Serial tumor and blood samples were collected.All patients successfully completed at least one cycle with transient, mild (Grade 1, 2) AEs and without significant systemic toxicity. Sustained (day 22) intratumoral expression of IL-12 protein was observed along with local inflammation and increased tumor-specific CD8+ T cell infiltration, which led to systemic immunologic and clinical responses. The overall response rate was 25% (3/12) in Cohort B, with two patients experiencing durable clinical benefit (16 and 55+ months respectively).

It is an inflammatory disorder with some features of autoimmunity. It is accepted that ectopic endometriotic tissue originates from endometrial cells exfoliated during menstruation and disseminating into the peritoneum by retrograde menstrual blood flow. It is assumed that the survival of endometriotic cells in the peritoneal cavity may be partially due to their abrogated elimination by natural killer (NK) cells. The decrease of NK cell cytotoxic activity in endometriosis is associated with an increased expression of some inhibitory NK cell receptors. It may be also related to the expression of human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G), a ligand for inhibitory leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily B member 1 (LILRB1) receptors. The downregulated cytotoxic activity of NK cells may be due to inhibitory cytokines present in the peritoneal milieu of patients with endometriosis. The role of NK cell receptors and their ligands in endometriosis is also confirmed by genetic association studies. Thus, endometriosis may be a subject of  by blocking NK cell negative control checkpoints including inhibitory NK cell receptors.

Here, we aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of peritumoral tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) either alone or jointly with the intratumoral densities and spatial distribution of CD8 + and CD163 + cells in breast cancer (BCa) patients. TLS were identified peritumorally, within the area distancing up to  mm from the infiltrative tumor border, counted and further characterized as adjacent or distal, in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples from a cohort of 167 patients, with histologically confirmed invasive ductal BCa. TLS and tumor-infiltrating immune cells were determined by H&E and immunohistochemistry. Clinical follow-up was available for 112 of these patients. Patients with peritumoral TLS exhibited worse disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) as compared to patients lacking TLS. Moreover, the density of peritumoral TLS was found to be crucial for prognosis, since patients with abundant TLS exhibited the worst DFS and OS. By combining the density of adjacent TLS (aTLS) with our recently published intratumoral signatures based on the differential distribution of CD8 + and CD163 + in the tumor center and invasive margin, we created two improved immune signatures with superior prognostic strength and higher patient population coverage. Our observations strengthen the notion for the fundamental role of the dynamic interplay between the immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (center/invasive margin) and the tumor surrounding area (peritumoral TLS) on the clinical outcome of BCa patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561494>New Strategies to Overcome Resistance to Chemotherapy and Immune System in Cancer.</a></h2><p>MultiDrug resistance (MDR) is a complex phenomenon responsible for multiple cross-resistance towards structurally unrelated drugs and it characterizes almost 70% of solid and haematological tumours at the diagnosis [...].</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553552>Mohs Surgery for the Treatment of Skin Cancer: A Review of Guidelines [Internet].</a></h2><p>Skin cancer is an abnormal growth of skin cells – usually caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation. The two most common types of skin cancers basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (usually grouped under non-melanoma skin cancers - NMSC). Melanoma, a less common but the most deadly form of skin cancer lead to 1,250 Canadian deaths in 2017. Other less common types of skin cancer include Merkel cell carcinoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, atypical fibroxanthoma and sebaceous carcinoma. Skin cancers can be invasive (invading through the basement membrane) or in situ (confined to the epidermis), and tumour characteristics such as size, location, and pathology influence the risk for deep tumour invasion and recurrence after treatment. Treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer usually includes surgical removal of the tumour, while treatment for melanoma may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and . Surgery for small skin cancer lesions can include simple excision, electrodesiccation and curettage, or cryosurgery; surgery for larger or recurrent lesions may include conventional wide excision of the tumour, or Mohs surgery. Mohs surgery, also known as Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is a surgical procedure in which thin layers of the tumour are progressively removed and examined until only cancer-free tissue remains, and can be done in a single visit at an outpatient clinic. The increased precision of MMS can also decrease scarring and reduces the likelihood for needing additional treatment or surgeries. Clinical evidence up to date showed that, compared with conventional surgical excision, MMS led to a significant higher cure rate for treatment of recurrent NMSC, and may have a role in the treatment of melanoma in situ and some other unusual skin cancers such as Merkel cell carcinoma and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. With a noticeable increase in use of MMS and associated expenditures in Canada, this Rapid Response report aims to review the evidence-based guidelines associated with the use of Mohs surgery for the treatment of skin cancer.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564895> polysaccharides regulate the innate immunity of colorectal cancer cells by modulating the TLR4 signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>It has been well-recognized that the polysaccharides from  (PAM) are immune system enhancers, which can facilitate the proliferation of lymphocytes and stimulate immune cells. Nevertheless, the antitumor effects of PAM and their molecular mechanisms remain unclear.Our research aimed to evaluate the anti-cancer effects of PAM on colorectal cancer (CRC).We tested the effects of PAM on the growth and proliferation of CRC cells and macrophages by MTT (3-(4,-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and secretion was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and ELISA assay. We also used MC38 cells xenograft model to test the anti-cancer effects of PAM in vivo.We found that although PAM treatment did not significantly affect the growth of CRC cells or enhance the proliferation of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), it could enhance the phagocytosis of BMDMs by CRC cells. Biochemical tests and immunoblotting assays revealed that exposing BMDMs to PAM promoted the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon λ (IFN λ), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and nitric oxide (NO) through the MyD88/TLR4-dependent signaling pathway. One noteworthy observation is that PAM treatment could significantly prevent tumorigenesis of MC38 cells in C57BL/6J mice and increase the survival duration of mice with tumors, without influence on the weight of those mice. However, the anti-cancer effects of PAM were compromised in TLR4 KO mice, further suggesting that TLR4 signaling plays a vital role in the anti-cancer effects of PAM.Therefore, PAM may prove to be a potential candidate in cancer .© 2019 Feng et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571532>Commentary on Some Recent Theses Relevant to Combating Aging: October 2019.</a></h2><p>Theses reviewed in this issue include "Cancer and Stem Cell Extravasation through Angiopellosis," "Human Chimeric Antigen Receptor Macrophages for Cancer ," "Insights on Alzheimer's Disease Etiology from Network Approaches in Healthy Aging," "Myelin and Glial Pathology in Aging and Cognitive Decline: Evidence for Faulty Myelin Clearance in the Rhesus Monkey," "Phosphatidylserine-Based Nanoparticles for Tolerance Induction Toward Therapeutic Proteins," and "Role of Endothelial Cell Stiffening in Choroidal Atrophy Associated with Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration."</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623231>The CD73/Ado System-A New Player in RT Induced Adverse Late Effects.</a></h2><p>Radiotherapy (RT) is a central component of standard treatment for many cancer patients. RT alone or in multimodal treatment strategies has a documented contribution to enhanced local control and overall survival of cancer patients, and cancer cure. Clinical RT aims at maximizing tumor control, while minimizing the risk for RT-induced adverse late effects. However, acute and late toxicities of IR in normal tissues are still important biological barriers to successful RT: While curative RT may not be tolerable, sub-optimal tolerable RT doses will lead to fatal outcomes by local recurrence or metastatic disease, even when accepting adverse normal tissue effects that decrease the quality of life of irradiated cancer patients. Technical improvements in treatment planning and the increasing use of particle therapy have allowed for a more accurate delivery of IR to the tumor volume and have thereby helped to improve the safety profile of RT for many solid tumors. With these technical and physical strategies reaching their natural limits, current research for improving the therapeutic gain of RT focuses on innovative biological concepts that either selectively limit the adverse effects of RT in normal tissues without protecting the tumor or specifically increase the radiosensitivity of the tumor tissue without enhancing the risk of normal tissue complications. The biology-based optimization of RT requires the identification of biological factors that are linked to differential radiosensitivity of normal or tumor tissues, and are amenable to therapeutic targeting. Extracellular adenosine is an endogenous mediator critical to the maintenance of homeostasis in various tissues. Adenosine is either released from stressed or injured cells or generated from extracellular adenine nucleotides by the concerted action of the ectoenzymes ectoapyrase (CD39) and ' ectonucleotidase (NT5E, CD73) that catabolize ATP to adenosine. Recent work revealed a role of the immunoregulatory CD73/adenosine system in radiation-induced fibrotic disease in normal tissues suggesting a potential use as novel therapeutic target for normal tissue protection. The present review summarizes relevant findings on the pathologic roles of CD73 and adenosine in radiation-induced fibrosis in different organs (lung, skin, gut, and kidney) that have been obtained in preclinical models and proposes a refined model of radiation-induced normal tissue toxicity including the disease-promoting effects of radiation-induced activation of CD73/adenosine signaling in the irradiated tissue environment. However, expression and activity of the CD73/adenosine system in the tumor environment has also been linked to increased tumor growth and tumor immune escape, at least in preclinical models. Therefore, we will discuss the use of pharmacologic inhibition of CD73/adenosine-signaling as a promising strategy for improving the therapeutic gain of RT by targeting both, malignant tumor growth and adverse late effects of RT with a focus on fibrotic disease. The consideration of the therapeutic window is particularly important in view of the increasing use of RT in combination with various molecularly targeted agents and  to enhance the tumor radiation response, as such combinations may result in increased or novel toxicities, as well as the increasing number of cancer survivors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590080>Older and younger patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors have similar outcomes in real-life setting.</a></h2><p>Age-related immune dysfunction might impair the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in older patients. We aimed to evaluate the impact of age on clinical outcomes and tolerance of ICIs in a real-life setting.All patients receiving a single-agent ICI (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA-4] or programmed death(ligand)1 [PD(L)-1] inhibitors) for the standard treatment of a locally advanced or metastatic cancer were included in this retrospective multicentric series. The primary end-point was overall survival (OS). Progression-free survival (PFS) and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) were secondary end-points. The impact of age was assessed using the threshold of 70 years.A total of 410 patients were included, for 435 lines of treatment, including 150 lines (34%) given to patients aged 70 years or older. The primary tumour types were lung cancer (n = 304, 74%), melanoma (n = 79, 19%) and urologic cancer (n = 27, 7%). Most of the administered treatments were PD(L)-1 inhibitors (n = 356, 82%). Median follow-up reached 46 months in the CTLA-4 cohort, and 20 months in the PD(L)-1 cohort.

Anti-HBV prophylaxis is suggested for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients undergoing rituximab therapy, even those with resolved HBV infection. Since anti-HBV prophylaxis for patients with resolved HBV infection is not covered by national health insurance in Taiwan, a proportion of these patients receive no prophylaxis. In addition, late HBV reactivation has emerged as a new issue in recent reports, and no consensus has been reached for the optimal duration of antiviral prophylaxis. Thus, the aim of our study was to investigate the incidence and outcomes of HBV reactivation in NHL patients in a real-world setting and to study the frequency of late HBV reactivation.Non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients who received rituximab and/or chemotherapy at our institute between January 2011 and December 2015 and who were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)- or hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb)-positive were reviewed retrospectively.A total of 388 patients were screened between January 2011 and December 2015. In total, 196 patients were excluded because HBsAg was not assessed, HBcAb was negative or not assessed, or they were not treated with immunosuppressive therapy. Finally, the retrospective study included 62 HBsAg-positive NHL patients and 130 NHL patients with resolved HBV infection (HBsAg-negative and HBcAb-positive). During a median 30.-month follow-up period, seven patients experienced HBV reactivation, five of whom had a hepatitis flare. The incidence of HBV reactivation did not significantly differ between the HBsAg-positive patients and the resolved HBV infection population without anti-HBV prophylaxis (4.8% vs. 3.1%,  = 0.683). All patients with HBV reactivation were exposed to rituximab. Notably, late HBV reactivation was not uncommon (two of seven patients with HBV reactivation events, 28.6%). Hepatitis B virus reactivation did not influence the patients' overall survival. An age ≥65 years and an advanced disease stage were independent risk factors for poorer overall survival.The incidence of HBV reactivation was similar between the HBsAg-positive patients with antiviral prophylaxis and the resolved HBV infection population without anti-HBV prophylaxis. All HBV reactivation events occurred in NHL patients exposed to rituximab. Late reactivation was not uncommon. The duration of regular liver function monitoring for more than 1 year after immunosuppressive therapy or after withdrawal of prophylactic antiviral therapy should be prolonged. Determining the exact optimal duration of anti-HBV prophylaxis is warranted in a future prospective study for NHL patients treated with rituximab-containing therapy.© 2019 Tsai et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598392>Promising new treatments for pancreatic cancer in the era of targeted and immune therapies.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality among men and women in the United States.

Current treatment strategies for HNSCC are surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy,  or combinatorial therapies. However, the overall -year survival rate of HNSCC patients remains at about 50%. Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a small population among tumor cells, are able to self-renew and differentiate into different tumor cell types in a hierarchical manner, similar to normal tissue. In HNSCC, CSCs are proposed to be responsible for tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, drug resistance, and recurrence. In this review, we discuss the molecular and cellular characteristics of CSCs in HNSCC. We summarize current approaches used in the literature for identification of HNSCC CSCs, and mechanisms required for CSC regulation. We also highlight the role of CSCs in treatment failure and therapeutic targeting options for eliminating CSCs in HNSCC.© The Author(s) 2019.

B7x belongs to the Immunoglobulin superfamily and its protein structure is similar to other members with a N terminus peptide, IgV and IgC like extracellular domain with four cysteine residues. Its receptor is yet to be identified. B7x inhibits T cell proliferation and expansion by IL-2 dependent and non-IL-2 dependent pathways. Even though high levels of B7x mRNA can be detected in most tissues its protein expression is highly limited suggesting significant post translational control. In vivo data, show that B7x plays an important role in limiting autoimmunity in the peripheral tissues and fine-tuning autoimmune responses. B7x is highly expressed in various cancers and in prostate cancer its expression is corelated with poorer outcomes. Local production of IL-6 and IL-10 in various cancers promotes B7x expression and tumor immune evasion. B7x is especially expressed in PD-L1 negative tumors suggesting that this may be an important method of immune evasion in these tumors. Currently drug development, targeting B7x through various mechanisms including monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates are in development in cancers and increasing B7x expression with fusion proteins in autoimmune diseases is underway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592495>Tumor-Selective Altered Glycosylation and Functional Attenuation of CD73 in Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>CD73, a cell-surface -linked glycoprotein that produces extracellular adenosine, is a novel target for cancer . Although anti-CD73 antibodies have entered clinical development, CD73 has both protumor and antitumor functions, depending on the target cell and tumor type. The aim of this study was to characterize CD73 regulation in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We examined CD73 expression, localization, and activity using molecular, biochemical, and cellular analyses on primary HCC surgical specimens, coupled with mechanistic studies in HCC cells. We analyzed CD73 glycan signatures and global alterations in transcripts encoding other -linked glycoproteins by using mass spectrometry glycomics and RNA sequencing (RNAseq), respectively. CD73 was expressed on tumor hepatocytes where it exhibited abnormal -linked glycosylation, independent of HCC etiology, tumor stage, or fibrosis presence. Aberrant glycosylation of tumor-associated CD73 resulted in a 3-fold decrease in '-nucleotidase activity ( 0.0001). Biochemically, tumor-associated CD73 was deficient in hybrid and complex glycans specifically on residues N311 and N333 located in the C-terminal catalytic domain. Blocking N311/N333 glycosylation by site-directed mutagenesis produced CD73 with significantly decreased '-nucleotidase activity , similar to the primary tumors. Glycosylation-deficient CD73 partially colocalized with the Golgi structural protein GM130, which was strongly induced in HCC tumors. RNAseq analysis further revealed that -linked glycoprotein-encoding genes represented the largest category of differentially expressed genes between HCC tumor and adjacent tissue.  We provide the first detailed characterization of CD73 glycosylation in normal and tumor tissue, revealing a novel mechanism that leads to the functional suppression of CD73 in human HCC tumor cells. The present findings have translational implications for therapeutic candidate antibodies targeting cell-surface CD73 in solid tumors and small-molecule adenosine receptor agonists that are in clinical development for HCC.© 2019 The Authors.

While low-dose chemotherapy reduces MDSCs in preclinical models, the use of this strategy to reduce MDSCs in GBM patients has yet to be evaluated.A phase 0/1 dose-escalation clinical trial was conducted in recurrent glioblastoma patients treated -7 days prior to surgery with low-dose chemotherapy via capecitabine followed by concomitant low-dose capecitabine and bevacizumab. Clinical outcomes, including progression-free and overall survival, were measured, along with safety and toxicity profiles. Over the treatment time course, circulating MDSC levels were measured by multi-parameter flow cytometry, and tumor tissue immune profiles were assessed via mass cytometry time-of-flight.A total of 11 patients were enrolled across escalating dose cohorts of 150, 300, and 450 mg bid. No serious adverse events related to the drug combination were observed. Compared to pre-treatment baseline, circulating MDSCs were found to be higher after surgery in the 150 mg treatment arm and lower in the 300 mg and 450 mg treatment arms. Increased cytotoxic immune infiltration was observed after low-dose capecitabine compared to untreated GBM patients in the 300 mg and 450 mg treatment arms.Low-dose, metronomic capecitabine in combination with bevacizumab is well tolerated in GBM patients and was associated with a reduction in circulating MDSC levels and an increase in cytotoxic immune infiltration into the tumor microenvironment..</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553168>Near-Infrared II Phototherapy Induces Deep Tissue Immunogenic Cell Death and Potentiates Cancer .</a></h2><p>The deep and inner beds of solid tumors lack lymphocytic infiltration and are subjected to various immune escape mechanisms. Reversing immunosuppression deep within the tumor is vital in clinical cancer therapy, however it remains a huge challenge. In this work, we have demonstrated the use of a second window near-infrared (NIR(II)) photothermal treatment to trigger more homogeneous and deeper immunogenic cancer cell death in solid tumors, thereby eliciting both innate and adaptive immune responses for tumor control and metastasis prevention. Specifically, photothermal transducers with similar components, structures, and photothermal conversion efficiencies, but different absorptions in red light, NIR(I), and NIR(II) biowindows, were constructed by controlling the self-assembly of gold nanoparticles on fluidic liposomes. , photothermal treatments induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) that were accompanied by the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) regardless of the wavelength of incident lasers. , NIR(II) light resulted in a more homogeneous release and distribution of DAMPs in the deeper parts of the tumors. With the induction of ICD, NIR(II) photothermal therapy simultaneously triggered both innate and adaptive immune responses and enabled efficient tumor control with /8 of the mice remaining tumor-free in the cancer vaccination assay. Additionally, the NIR(II) photothermal treatment in combination with checkpoint blockade therapy exerted long-term tumor control over both primary and distant tumors. Finally, using systemically administered two-dimensional polypyrrole nanosheets as a NIR(II) transducer, we achieved striking therapeutic effects against whole-body tumor metastasis  a synergistic photothermal-immunological response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31556762>Totality of evidence in the development of ABP 215, an approved bevacizumab biosimilar.</a></h2><p>ABP 215 (MVASI™) is the first approved biosimilar to Avastin (bevacizumab).

Here, we examined the clinicopathologic signification of HLA I expression in patients with gastric cancer (GC). Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect HLA A/B/C, β2M, CD8, p53, and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in the center and invasive margin of the tumor in 395 stage II and III GCs using tissue array method. Additionally, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and microsatellite instability (MSI) status were investigated. Negative expression of HLA A/B/C and β2M was observed in 258 (65.3%) and 235 (59.%) of 395 stage II and III GCs, respectively. Negative HLA I expression was significantly associated with aggressive clinicopathologic features. Furthermore, negative expression of HLA A/B/C and β2M was inversely correlated with CD8-positive cytotoxic T cell infiltration, EBV-positivity, and PD-L1 expression (all p < 0.001). Patients with HLA A/B/C-negative GC had worse overall survival (OS) (p = 0.019) and combined analysis with both HLA A/B/C and β2M expression status significantly predicted OS in univariate (p = 0.004) and multivariate survival analysis (p = 0.016).

This synthetic pyrazolone derivative is a potent scavenger of oxygen free radicals and also functions as a modulator of transcription factors, repressing NFκB and activating Nrf2, to regulate oxidative stress. EDA displays complementary anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The injectable small molecule is currently investigated for the treatment of several non-neurological diseases. The potential interest of EDA in oncology is reviewed here. EDA is a mild antiproliferative agent but has been found to enhance significantly the anticancer and antimetastatic activities of irinotecan in a colon cancer model. Anticancer derivatives of EDA have been designed but they generally display a limited antiproliferative activity. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of EDA can be best exploited to protect non-tumor cells from damages induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and radiations. Notably EDA can reduce the renal dysfunction induced by cisplatin, the neurotoxicity of cyclophosphamide and the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. Upon treatment with EDA, a significant improvement in neurologic symptoms has been observed in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy. The drug could be used to limit radiation-induced brain injury or oral mucositis. EDA was found to ameliorate autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), which is a frequent side effect observed after treatment of cancer patients with monoclonal antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint PD-1. Therefore, EDA could also be useful to reduce specific side effects of immuno-therapy. Collectively, the information suggests that the medical use of EDA, a drug with a proven safety after 18 years of use in brain-related Human diseases, could be extended to cancer-related conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report a multifunctional nanomaterial system for the combination of PDT and personalized cancer  and demonstrate their potency against local as well as disseminated tumors. Specifically, we have synthesized uniform and biodegradable mesoporous silica nanoparticles (bMSN) with an average size of ∼80 nm and large pore size of -10 nm for theranostic positron emission tomography (PET)-guided PDT and neoantigen-based cancer vaccination. Multiple neoantigen peptides, CpG oligodeoxynucleotide adjuvant, and photosensitizer chlorin e6 were coloaded into a bMSN nanoplatform, and PET imaging revealed effective accumulation of bMSN in tumors (up to 9.0% ID/g) after intravenous administration. Subsequent PDT with laser irradiation recruited dendritic cells to PDT-treated tumor sites and elicited neoantigen-specific, tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T-cell lymphocytes.

Host factors, including an immature immune system in infants, low lymphocyte levels in patients under  years old, and low levels of RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies in the blood of adults over 65 years of age, can explain the high susceptibility to RSV infection in these populations. Other host factors that correlate with severe RSV disease include high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukins (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and thymic stromal lymphopoitein (TSLP), which are produced in the respiratory tract of RSV-infected individuals, accompanied by a strong neutrophil response. In addition, data from studies of RSV infections in humans and in animal models revealed that this virus suppresses adaptive immune responses that could eliminate it from the respiratory tract.

However, the detailed process remains largely undefined. It was reported that nuclear receptors COUP-TFII and TR4 are recruited to the enriched GGGTCA variant repeats embedded within ALT telomeres, implicating nuclear receptors in regulating ALT activity. Here, we identified a function of nuclear receptors in ALT telomere maintenance that involves a direct interaction between COUP-TFII/TR4 and FANCD2, the key protein in the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway. The COUP-TFII/TR4-FANCD2 complex actively induces the DNA damage response by recruiting endonuclease MUS81 and promoting the loading of the PCNA-POLD3 replication complex in ALT telomeres. Furthermore, the COUP-TFII/TR4-mediated ALT telomere pathway does not require the FA core complex or the monoubiquitylation of FANCD2, key steps in the canonical FA pathway. Thus, our findings reveal that COUP-TFII/TR4 regulates ALT telomere maintenance through a novel noncanonical FANCD2 pathway.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Der p 2 is the major allergen of the house dust mite (HDM) Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. Allergen-specific  is the only treatment to change the course of allergic diseases. In this study, two synthesized Der p 2 peptides coupled to cross-reacting material 197 (CRM197) showed reduced IgE reactivity and allergenic activity. CRM197-coupled Der p 2 peptides induced rDer p 2-specific IgG1 antibodies in mice, which could inhibit HDM-allergic patients' IgE binding to rDer p 2. The immunity effects of CRM197-coupled Der p 2 peptides were studied in an rDer p 2-induced asthma mouse model. CRM197-coupled Der p 2 peptides can suppress asthmatic airway inflammation in this model. Analysis of IL-4, IL-, and IFN-γ levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed that the suppression was associated with a shift from a Th2 to a Th1 response. Thus, CRM197-bound Der p 2 peptides exhibited less allergenic activity than the rDer p 2 allergen, which preserved immunogenicity and may be candidates for mite allergy vaccines.© 2019 S.

Despite encouraging and sometimes durable responses in a subset of patients, most patients do not respond. Tumors have adopted the PD-1/PD-L1 axis for immune escape to facilitate tumor growth, which can be leveraged as a potential target for immune checkpoint inhibitors. On this basis, PD-L1 protein expression on tumor or immune cells emerged as the first potential predictive biomarker for sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. The goal of our study was to evaluate PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker based on all US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug approvals of immune checkpoint inhibitors. We evaluated the primary studies associated with 45 FDA drug approvals from 2011 until April 2019. In total, there were approvals across 15 tumor types. Across all approvals, PD-L1 was predictive in only 28.9% of cases, and was either not predictive (53.3%) or not tested (17.8%) in the remaining cases. There were 9 FDA approvals linked to a specific PD-L1 threshold and companion diagnostic: bladder cancer (N = 3), non-small cell lung cancer (N = 3), triple-negative breast cancer (N = 1), cervical cancer (N = 1), and gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer (N = 1) with 8 of 9 (88.9%) with immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy. The PD-L1 thresholds were variable both within and across tumor types using several different assays, including approvals at the following PD-L1 thresholds: 1, , and 50%. PD-L1 expression was also measured in a variable fashion either on tumor cells, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, or both. In conclusion, our findings indicate that PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker has limitations and that the decision to pursue testing must be carefully implemented for clinical decision-making.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666344>Prolonged survival in the absence of disease-recurrence in advanced-stage follicular lymphoma following chemo-: 13-year update of the prospective, multicenter randomized GITMO-IIL trial.</a></h2><p>A prospective trial conducted in the period 2000-2005 showed no survival advantage for high-dose chemotherapy with rituximab and autograft (R-HDS)  conventional chemotherapy with rituximab (CHOP-R) as first-line therapy in 134 high-risk follicular lymphoma patients aged <60 years. The study has been updated at the 13-year median follow up. As of February 2017, 88 (66%) patients were alive, with overall survival of 66.4% at 13 years, without a significant difference between R-HDS (64.%) and CHOP-R (68.%). To date, 46 patients have died, mainly because of disease progression (47.8% of all deaths), secondary malignancies (3 solid tumor, 9 myelodysplasia/acute leukemia; 26.1% of all deaths), and other toxicities (21.7% of all deaths). Complete remission was documented in 98 (73.1%) patients and associated with overall survival, with 13-year estimates of 77.0% and 36.8% for complete remission  no-complete remission, respectively. Molecular remission was documented in 39 (65%) out of 60 evaluable patients and associated with improved survival. In multivariate analysis, complete remission achievement had the strongest effect on survival (<0.001), along with younger age (=0.002) and female sex (=0.013). Overall, 50 patients (37.3%) survived with no disease recurrence (18 CHOP-R, 32 R-HDS). This follow up is the longest reported on follicular lymphoma treated upfront with rituximab-chemotherapy and demonstrates an unprecedented improvement in survival compared to the pre-rituximab era, regardless of the use of intensified or conventional treatment. Complete remission was the most important factor for prolonged survival and a high proportion of patients had prolonged survival in their first remission, raising the issue of curability in follicular lymphoma.

Immunotherapies such as those that target immune checkpoint molecules can be used to augment immune-mediated elimination of tumours and have resulted in durable responses in patients with cancer that did not respond to previous treatments. However, only a subset of patients benefit from  and more knowledge about what is required for successful treatment is needed. Although the role of tumour neoantigen-specific CD8 T cells in tumour rejection is well established, the roles of other subsets of T cells have received less attention. Here we show that spontaneous and -induced anti-tumour responses require the activity of both tumour-antigen-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells, even in tumours that do not express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. In addition, the expression of MHC class II-restricted antigens by tumour cells is required at the site of successful rejection, indicating that activation of CD4 T cells must also occur in the tumour microenvironment. These findings suggest that MHC class II-restricted neoantigens have a key function in the anti-tumour response that is nonoverlapping with that of MHC class I-restricted neoantigens and therefore needs to be considered when identifying patients who will most benefit from .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578302>Autologous nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for neuromyelitis optica.</a></h2><p>To determine if autologous nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) could be a salvage therapy for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).Thirteen patients were enrolled in a prospective open-label cohort study (11 NMOSD aquaporin-4-immunoglobulin G [AQP4-IgG]-positive, 1 NMOSD without AQP4, and 1 NMOSD AQP4-IgG-positive with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]). Following stem cell mobilization with cyclophosphamide (2 g/m) and filgrastim, patients were treated with cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) divided as 50 mg/kg IV on day - to day -2, rATG (thymoglobulin) given IV at 0. mg/kg on day -, 1 mg/kg on day -4, and 1. mg/kg on days -3, -2, and -1 (total dose 6 mg/kg), and rituximab 500 mg IV on days -6 and +1. Unselected peripheral blood stem cells were infused on day 0. AQP4-IgG antibody status was determined by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-validated ELISA or flow cytometry assays. Cell-killing activity was measured using a flow cytometry-based complement assay.Median follow-up was 57 months. The patient with coexistent SLE died of complications of active lupus 10 months after HSCT. For the 12 patients with NMOSD without other active coexisting autoimmune diseases, 11 patients are more than  years post-transplant, and 80% are relapse-free off all immunosuppression ( < 0.001). At 1 and  years after HSCT, Expanded Disability Status Scale score improved from a baseline mean of 4.4 to 3.3 ( < 0.01) at  years. The Neurologic Rating Scale score improved after HSCT from a baseline mean of 69. to 85.7 at  years ( < 0.01). The Short Form-36 health survey for quality of life total score improved from mean 34.2 to 62.1 ( = 0.001) at  years. In the 11 patients whose baseline AQP4-IgG serostatus was positive, 9 patients became seronegative by the immunofluorescence or cell-binding assays available at the time; complement activating and cell-killing ability of patient serum was switched off in 6 of 7 patients with before and after HSCT testing. Two patients remained AQP4-IgG-seropositive (with persistent complement activating and cell-killing ability) and relapsed within 2 years of HSCT. No patient with seronegative conversion relapsed.Prolonged drug-free remission with AQP4-IgG seroconversion to negative following nonmyeloablative autologous HSCT warrants further investigation.© 2019 American Academy of Neurology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571332>Efficacy of the NCCV Cocktail-1 vaccine for refractory pediatric solid tumors: a phase I clinical trial.</a></h2><p>Pediatric refractory solid tumors are aggressive type of malignant diseases, resulting in an extremely poor prognosis. KOC1, FOXM1, and KIF20A are cancer antigens that could be ideal targets for anticancer  against pediatric refractory solid tumors with positive expression for these antigens. This nonrandomized, open-label, phase I clinical trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of the NCCV Cocktail-1 vaccine, which is a cocktail of cancer peptides derived from KOC1, FOXM1, and KIF20A, in patients with pediatric refractory solid tumors. Twelve patients with refractory pediatric solid tumors underwent NCCV Cocktail-1 vaccination weekly via intradermal injections. The primary endpoint was the safety of the NCCV Cocktail-1 vaccination, and the secondary endpoints were the immune response, as measured by interferon-r enzyme-linked immunospot assay, and the clinical outcomes including tumor response and progression-free survival (PFS). The NCCV Cocktail-1 vaccine was well-tolerated. The clinical response of this trial showed that four patients had stable disease after 8 weeks and two patients maintained remission for > 11 months. In four, eight, and five patients, the NCCV Cocktail-1 vaccine induced the sufficient number of peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) for KOC1, FOXM1, and KIF20A, respectively. Patients with high peptide-specific CTL frequencies for KOC1, FOXM1, and KIF20A had better PFS than those with low frequencies. The findings of this clinical trial showed that the NCCV Cocktail-1 vaccine could be one of the novel therapeutic strategies, with resulting in adequate anticancer effects, against pediatric refractory solid tumors. Future large-scale trials should evaluate the efficacy of the NCCV Cocktail-1 vaccination.© 2019 The Authors.

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and infection are the most common adverse events during CAR T-cell therapy. Similar clinical presentation of concurrent CRS and infection makes it difficult to differentially diagnose and timely treat the condition.We analyzed the features of infection events during the first 30 days after CAR T-cell infusion (CTI) in 109 patients from three clinical trials (ChiCTR-OPN-16008526, ChiCTR-OPC-16009113, ChiCTR-OPN-16009847). Based on the dynamic changes of interleukin (IL)-6 and ferritin, we proposed the "double peaks of IL-6" pattern as a feature of life-threatening infection during the first 30 days after CTI. Meanwhile, we screened candidate biomarkers from 70-biomarker panel to establish a prediction model for life-threatening infection.In this study, 19 patients (17.4%) experienced a total of 19 infection events during the first 30 days after CAR T-cell infusion. Eleven patients (10.1%) had grade 4- infection, which were all bacterial infection and predominantly sepsis (N = 9). "Double peaks of IL-6" appeared in 9 out of 11 patients with life-threatening infection. The prediction model of three-cytokines (IL-8, IL-1β and interferon-γ) could predict life-threatening infection with high sensitivity (training: 100.0%; validation: 100.0%) and specificity (training: 97.6%; validation: 82.8%). On base of the aforementioned methods, we proposed a workflow for quick identification of life-threatening infection during CAR T-cell therapy.In this study, we worked out two diagnostic methods for life-threatening infection during CAR T-cell therapy by analyzing inflammatory signatures, which contributed to reducing risks of infection-induced death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610204>Probiotic supplementation attenuates the aggressiveness of chemically induced colorectal tumor in rats.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the effect of a probiotic on the aggressiveness of a chemically induced colorectal tumor in rats. Twenty-five male Fisher 344 rats, 250 g, provided with feed and water ad libitum, were randomly divided into  groups ( rats/group): G, no treatment; G, tumor induction; G, tumor induction, -Fluorouracil applied; G, induction of the tumor, supplemented with probiotic; G, tumor induction, -Fluorouracil applied, supplemented with probiotic. For tumor induction 20 mg/kg of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine was applied intraperitoneally over 4 weeks, followed by an interval of 15 days, and then repeated for a further 4 weeks. Five weeks after the final dose of the carcinogen, treatment was initiated with -Fluorouracil (15 mg/kg, intraperitoneally/week) and a commercial probiotic (1 × 10 CFU, daily/gavage). Data were analyzed by One Way Variance Analysis and means compared by Dunnett's test. GraphPad Prism statistical software was used. The histopathological analyzes were evaluated by the chi-square test. A % type-I error was considered statistically significant. Compared with the G, the G (p < 0.0373) and G (p < 0.0003) demonstrated an attenuated effect on the aggressiveness of the colorectal tumor, with a reduction in the count of Aberrant Crypt foci; and a lower percentage of malignant neoplastic lesions in the G (40% low grade tubular adenoma, 40% carcinoma in situ, 20% low grade adenocarcinoma) and G (40% low grade tubular adenoma and 60% carcinoma in situ).

In this single-arm phase I trial (), we assessed the safety of combining pembrolizumab with thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) after induction chemotherapy for SCLC.ES-SCLC patients who had completed chemotherapy received TRT with pembrolizumab. The maximum tolerated dose of pembrolizumab was assessed by 3+3 dose-escalation; doses began at 100 mg and increased in 50 mg increments to 200 mg. Pembrolizumab was given every 3 weeks for up to 16 cycles; TRT was prescribed as 45 Gy in 15 daily fractions. Toxicity was evaluated with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0. The primary endpoint was safety of the combined therapy based on the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLTs) in the 35 days following initiation of treatment.Thirty-eight ES-SCLC patients (median age 65 years, range, 37-79) were enrolled from September 2015 through September 2017; 33 received per-protocol treatment, and all tolerated pembrolizumab at 100-200 mg with no DLTs in the 35-day window. There were no grade 4- toxicities; two (6%) experienced grade 3 events (n=1 rash, n=1 asthenia/paresthesia/autoimmune disorder) that were unlikely/doubtfully related to protocol therapy. The median follow-up time was 7.3 months (range 1-13); median progression-free and overall survival were 6.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.1-8.1) and 8.4 months (95% CI 6.7-10.1).Concurrent pembrolizumab-TRT was tolerated well, with few high-grade adverse events in the short-term; progression-free and overall survival rates are difficult to interpret due to heterogeneity in eligibility criteria (e.g. enrolling progressors on induction chemotherapy). Although randomized studies have illustrated benefits to TRT alone and  alone, the safety of the combined regimen supports further investigation as a foundational approach for future prospective studies.Copyright © 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

Diagnosis of EOC is frequently made at advanced stages and, despite aggressive treatments combining surgery and chemotherapy, fatal relapse rapidly occurs and is accompanied by a peritoneal carcinosis. In this context, novel therapeutical advances are urgently required. Adoptive transfer(s) of immune effector cells, including allogeneic human Vγ9Vδ2 T lymphocytes, represent attractive targets for efficiently and safely tracking tissue-invading tumor cells and controlling tumor dissemination in the organism. Our study describes the establishment of robust and physiological orthotopic model of human EOC in mouse, that includes surgical resection (ovariectomy) and chemotherapy, which are ineluctably accompanied by a fatal peritoneal carcinosis recurrence. Through a complementary set of  and  experiments, we provide here a preclinical proof of interest of the antitumor efficiency of adoptive transfers of allogeneic human Vγ9Vδ2 T lymphocytes against EOC, in association with surgical debulking and standard chemotherapies (i.e., taxanes and platinum salts). Moreover, our results indicate that chemo- and immunotherapies can be combined to improve the antitumor efficiency of immunotherapeutic lines. Altogether, these results further pave the way for next-generation antitumor immunotherapies, based on local administrations of human allogeneic human Vγ9Vδ2 T lymphocytes, in association with standard treatments.© 2019 The Author(s).

Subjects had Asthma Control Questionnaire score of 1.0 to 1. and daily inhaled corticosteroid use of 200 to 400 μg of fluticasone propionate at randomization. The primary end point was the time from randomization to the first asthma exacerbation as the inhaled corticosteroid dose was being reduced.Of the 826 randomized subjects, 693 (84%) completed the trial. No statistically significant differences between the active groups and the placebo group were observed for the primary or any other efficacy end points. However, post hoc analysis indicated a significant difference between the 20,000 Japanese Allergy Unit and placebo groups among subjects who used a short-acting β-agonist during the baseline period (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.48-1.00; P = .04997). No deaths or anaphylactic reactions were reported. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity.The trial demonstrated a favorable safety profile of the SQ HDM SLIT tablet in Japanese adult patients with AA. The treatment appeared to be efficacious in patients requiring rescue medication (ie, short-acting β-agonist) at baseline in the efficacy assessment using asthma exacerbation during inhaled corticosteroid reduction (JapicCTI number 121847).Copyright © 2019 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

The most abundant immunoglobulin isotype in serum is Immunoglobulin G (IgG), which is involved in many humoral immune responses, strongly interacting with effector molecules. The IgG subclass, allotype, and glycosylation pattern, among other factors, determine the interaction strength of the IgG-Fc domain with these Fc engaging molecules, and thereby the potential strength of their effector potential. The molecules responsible for the effector phase include the classical IgG-Fc receptors (FcγR), the neonatal Fc-receptor (FcRn), the Tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21), the first component of the classical complement cascade (C1), and possibly, the Fc-receptor-like receptors (FcRL4/). Here we provide an overview of the interactions of IgG with effector molecules and discuss how natural variation on the antibody and effector molecule side shapes the biological activities of antibodies. The increasing knowledge on the Fc-mediated effector functions of antibodies drives the development of better therapeutic antibodies for cancer  or treatment of autoimmune diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632461>Reduced serum immunoglobulin G concentrations in multiple sclerosis: prevalence and association with disease-modifying therapy and disease course.</a></h2><p>In multiple sclerosis (MS), the frequency of hypogammaglobulinemia is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the frequency of reduced immunoglobulin (Ig) concentrations and its association with  and disease course in two independent MS cohorts.In our retrospective cross-sectional study, MS patients and control patients with head or neck pain from Bern University Hospital (Bern, Switzerland) and Eginition University Hospital (Athens, Greece) were included. The lower limits of normal (LLN) for serum Ig concentration were IgG < 700 mg/dl, IgM < 40 mg/dl, and IgA < 70 mg/dl. Mann-Whitney  test, analysis of variance test, and multiple linear regression analysis were employed.In total, 327 MS patients were retrospectively identified (Bern/Athens:  = 226/101). Serum IgG concentrations were frequently under LLN in both MS cohorts (Bern/Athens: 15.%/14.9%), even when considering only untreated patients (Bern/Athens: 7.9%/8.6%). MS patients ( = 327) were significantly more likely to have IgG concentrations below LLN and below 600 mg/dl in comparison with controls ( = 58) ( = 0.015 and 0.047, respectively). Between both patient groups, no significant differences were found in frequencies of IgA and IgM concentrations under LLN [ (MS patients/controls): IgA 203/30, IgM 224/24]. Independently of age, secondary progressive MS patients had lower IgG concentrations than relapsing-remitting and primary progressive patients (both:  ⩽ 0.01). After adjusting for sex, age, and disease course, IgG concentrations were lower in patients treated with rituximab ( = 0.001;  = 42/327), intravenous corticosteroids ( < 0.001;  = 16/327), natalizumab ( < 0.001;  = 48/327), and fingolimod ( = 0.003;  = 6/327).Our study demonstrated high prevalence rates of reduced serum IgG concentrations in MS patients with and without disease-modifying treatments. The significance of lower IgG concentrations at the levels noted is unclear considering that infections or interference with antibody production generally occur when IgG levels are much lower, at or below 400 mg/dl. However, the information is useful to monitor IgG levels especially with anti-B-cell therapies and consider IgG substitution when levels drop below 400 mg/dl.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633019>Epigenetic initiation of the T17 differentiation program is promoted by Cxxc finger protein 1.</a></h2><p>IL-6/STAT3 signaling is known to initiate the T17 differentiation program, but the upstream regulatory mechanisms remain minimally explored. Here, we show that Cxxc finger protein 1 (Cxxc1) promoted the generation of T17 cells as an epigenetic regulator and prevented their differentiation into T cells. Mice with a T cell-specific deletion of Cxxc1 were protected from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and were more susceptible to  infection. Cxxc1 deficiency decreased IL-6Rα expression and impeded IL-6/STAT3 signaling, whereas the overexpression of IL-6Rα could partially reverse the defects in -deficient T17 cells in vitro and in vivo. Genome-wide occupancy analysis revealed that Cxxc1 bound to α gene loci by maintaining the appropriate H3K4me3 modification of its promoter. Therefore, these data highlight that Cxxc1 as a key regulator governs the balance between T17 and T cells by controlling the expression of IL-6Rα, which affects IL-6/STAT3 signaling and has an impact on T17-related autoimmune diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The primary objective was to evaluate, within PAM50 Luminal A/B disease, if the anti-proliferative effect of LTZ+mVNB was superior to monotherapy. An anti-proliferative effect was defined as the mean relative decrease of the PAM50 11-gene proliferation score in combination arm vs. both monotherapy arms. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of a comprehensive panel of breast cancer-related genes and safety. An unplanned analysis of stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) was also performed. PAM50 analyses were performed using the nCounter®-based Breast Cancer 360™ gene panel, which includes 752 genes and 32 signatures.Sixty-one patients were randomized, and 54 paired samples (89%) were analyzed. The main patient characteristics were mean age of 67, mean tumor size of 1.7 cm, mean Ki67 of 14.3%, stage I (55.7%), and grades 1-2 (90%). Most baseline samples were PAM50 Luminal A (74.1%) or B (22.2%). The anti-proliferative effect of 3 weeks of LTZ+mVNB (- 73.2%) was superior to both monotherapy arms combined (- 49.9%; p = 0.001) and mVNB (- 19.1%; p < 0.001). The anti-proliferative effect of LTZ+mVNB (- 73.2%) was numerically higher compared to LTZ (- 65.7%) but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.328). LTZ+mVNB induced high expression of immune-related genes and gene signatures, including CD8 T cell signature and PDL1 gene and low expression of ER-regulated genes (e.g., progesterone receptor) and cell cycle-related and DNA repair genes. In tumors with ≤ 10% sTILs at baseline, a statistically significant increase in sTILs was observed following LTZ (paired analysis p = 0.049) and LTZ+mVNB (p = 0.012). Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 3.4% of the cases.Short-term mVNB is well-tolerated and presents anti-proliferative activity alone and in combination with LTZ.

In the current study, we compared the outcomes of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with TCRαβ+/CD19+ depletion from matched unrelated donors (MUDs) and mismatched related donors (MMRDs) in primary immunodeficiency (PID) patients. 98 pediatric patients with various PIDs underwent HSCT with TCRαβ+/CD19+ graft depletion from MUDs (n=75) and MMRDs (n=23). All patients received a fludarabine-/treosulfan-based conditioning regimen, with 73 also receiving a second alkylating agent. For GVHD prophylaxis, all but 2 received serotherapy (anti-thymocyte globulin) before HSCT and a short course of posttransplant immunosuppression. Neutrophil and platelet engraftment in both the MUD and MMRD groups occurred on days 14 and 13, respectively. The incidence of secondary graft failure was 0,16 and 0,17 (p=0,85), respectively. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD grade 2-4 was 0,17 in the MUD group and 0,22 in the MMRD group (p=0,7). The incidence of CMV viremia was 0, in the MUD group and 0,6 in the MMRD group (p=0,35). The frequency of CMV disease was high (17%), and the most common manifestation was retinitis. The kinetics of immune recovery was similar in both groups. The overall survival was 0,86 in the MUD group and 0,87 in the MMRD group (p=0,95). In our experience, there was no difference in the outcomes of HSCT performed from MUD and MMRD. Hence, given the immediate availability of donors, in the absence of HLA-identical siblings HSCT with TCRαβ+/CD19+ graft depletion from MMRDs can be considered as the first choice in patients with PID.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Hematology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609094>Novel therapeutic targets in salivary duct carcinoma uncovered by comprehensive molecular profiling.</a></h2><p>Salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) is a rare, aggressive salivary gland malignancy, which often presents at an advanced stage. A proportion of SDC are characterized by HER2 amplification and/or overexpression of androgen receptor (AR), which could be targeted in a subset of patients, but the presence of AR splice variant-7 (AR-V7) in some SDC cases could result in resistance to anti-androgen therapy. We evaluated a cohort of 28 cases of SDC for potentially targetable biomarkers and pathways using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next-generation sequencing (DNA and RNA) assays. Pathogenic genetic aberrations were found in all but 1 case and affected TP53 (n = 19), HRAS (n = 7), PIK3CA, ERBB2 (HER2), and NF1 (n =  each); KMT2C (MLL3) and PTEN (n = 3 each); BRAF (p.V600E), KDM5C and NOTCH1 (n = 2 each). Androgen receptor was expressed in all cases and 13 of 27 harbored the AR-V7 splice variant (including a case without any other detectable genetic alteration). HER2 IHC was expressed in 11 of 28 cases. The majority of SDC cases had no biomarkers predictive of  response:  cases exhibited low (1%-8%) programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in tumor cells, 2 cases exhibited elevated TMB, and no samples exhibited microsatellite instability. Notably, the pre-treatment biopsies from 2 patients with metastatic disease, who demonstrated clinical responses to anti-androgen therapy, showed AR expression and no AR splice variants. We conclude that comprehensive molecular profiling of SDCs can guide the selection of patients for targeted therapies involving AR, HER2, PD-L1, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and PIK3CA pathways.© 2019 The Authors.

Many patients traditionally presented with aberrant behavior, especially of acute or subacute onset, and treated with anti-psychotic therapies, turn out to have a CNS autoimmune disease with pathogenic autoantibodies against synaptic antigens responding to immunotherapies. The review describes the clinical spectrum of these disorders, and the pathogenetic role of key autoantibodies directed against: a) cell surface synaptic antigens and receptors, including NMDAR, GABAa, GABAb, AMPA and glycine receptors; b) channels such as AQP4 water-permeable channel or voltage-gated potassium channels; c) proteins that stabilize voltage-gated potassium channel complex into the membrane, like the LGI1 and CASPR2; and d) enzymes that catalyze the formation of neurotransmitters such as Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GAD). These antibodies, effectively target excitatory or inhibitory synapses in the limbic system, basal ganglia or brainstem altering synaptic function and resulting in uncontrolled neurological excitability disorder clinically manifested with psychosis, agitation, behavioral alterations, depression, sleep disturbances, seizure-like phenomena, movement disorders such as ataxia, chorea and dystonia, memory changes or coma. Some of the identified triggering factors include: viruses, especially herpes simplex, accounting for the majority of relapses occurring after viral encephalitis, which respond to  rather than antiviral agents; tumors especially teratoma, SCLC and thymomas; and biological cancer therapies (immune-check-point inhibitors). As anti-synaptic antibodies persist after viral infections or tumor removal, augmentation of autoreactive B cells which release autoantigens to draining lymph nodes, molecular mimicry and infection-induced bystander immune activation products play a role in autoimmunization process or perpetuating autoimmune neuroinflammation. The review stresses the importance of early detection, clinical recognition, proper antibody testing and early therapy initiation as these disorders, regardless of a known or not trigger, are potentially treatable responding to systemic  with intravenous steroids, IVIg, rituximab or even bortezomid.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Since MSI is associated with a poor response to -fluorouracile based chemotherapy and is a positive predictive marker of , it is routine practice to evaluate the MSI status of resected tumors in CRC patients. MSIsensor is a novel computational tool for determining MSI status using Next Generation Sequencing. However, it is not widely used in the clinic and has not been independently validated in exome data from CRC. To facilitate clinical implementation of computational determination of MSI status, we compared MSIsensor to current gold standard methods for MSI testing.MSI status was determined for 130 CRC patients (UICC stage I-IV) using immunohistochemistry, PCR based microsatellite stability testing and by applying MSIsensor to exome sequenced tumors and paired germline DNA. Furthermore, we investigated correlation between MSI status, mutational load and mutational signatures.Eighteen out of 130 (13.8%) patients were microsatellite instable. We found a 100% agreement between MSIsensor and gold standard methods for MSI testing. All MSI tumors were hypermutated. In addition, two microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors were hypermutated, which was explained by a dominant POLE signature and pathogenic POLE mutations (p.Pro286Arg and p.Ser459Phe).MSIsensor is a robust tool, which can be used to determine MSI status of tumor samples from exome sequenced CRC patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636701>De Novo Isolation & Affinity Maturation of yeast-displayed Virion-binding human fibronectin domains by flow cytometric screening against Virions.</a></h2><p>The promise of biopharmaceuticals comprising one or more binding domains motivates the development of novel methods for de novo isolation and affinity maturation of virion-binding domains. Identifying avenues for overcoming the challenges associated with using virions as screening reagents is paramount given the difficulties associated with obtaining high-purity virus-associated proteins that retain the conformation exhibited on the virion surface.Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) of 1. × 10 clones taken from a naïve yeast surface-displayed human fibronectin domain (Fn3) against whole virions yielded two unique binders to Zika virions. Construction and FACS of site-directed binding loop mutant libraries based on one of these binders yielded multiple progeny clones with enhanced Zika-binding affinities. These affinity-matured clones bound Zika virions with low double- or single-digit nanomolar affinity in ELISA assays, and expressed well as soluble proteins in  shake flask culture, with post-purification yields exceeding 10 mg/L.FACS of a yeast-displayed binding domain library is an efficient method for de novo isolation of virion-binding domains. Affinities of isolated virion-binding clones are readily enhanced via FACS screening of mutant progeny libraries. Given that most binding domains are compatible with yeast display, the approach taken in this work may be broadly utilized for generating virion-binding domains against many different viruses for use in passive  and the prevention of viral infection.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594913>A Phase I Trial Using a Multitargeted Recombinant Adenovirus  (CEA/MUC1/Brachyury)-Based  Vaccine Regimen in Patients with Advanced Cancer.</a></h2><p>Concurrent ETBX-011, ETBX-051, and ETBX-061 can be safely administered to patients with advanced cancer.All patients developed CD4 and/or CD8 T-cell responses after vaccination to at least one tumor-associated antigen (TAA) encoded by the vaccine; /6 patients (83%) developed MUC1-specific T cells, 4/6 (67%) developed CEA-specific T cells, and 3/6 (50%) developed brachyury-specific T cells.The presence of adenovirus -neutralizing antibodies did not prevent the generation of TAA-specific T cells.A novel adenovirus-based vaccine targeting three human tumor-associated antigens-CEA, MUC1, and brachyury-has demonstrated antitumor cytolytic T-cell responses in preclinical animal models of cancer.This open-label, phase I trial evaluated concurrent administration of three therapeutic vaccines (ETBX-011 = CEA, ETBX-051 = MUC1, and ETBX-061 = brachyury).

In this group the median overall survival (mOS) was 59 months (95% CI: 28.2-89.8), significantly higher than the mOS in patients with inoperable tumour [n = 50; mOS: 19 months (96% CI: 7-31, P <0.0001)]. Patients receiving  (n = 20) showed a statistically significant better survival compared to those treated with other systemic therapies (n = 37; mOS not reached vs. mOS: 22 months (95% CI: 6.-43.), P = 0.034). For patients without systemic therapy, a combination of surgery and radiotherapy provided better outcomes compared to radiotherapy alone or best supportive care (P <0.001).Surgical complete resection should be the first therapeutic option for patients with acSCC. For patients with inoperable tumour, first-line  should be preferably considered.© 2019 The Authors.

The present study aimed to detect Treg cell function under simulated inflammatory conditions to provide a foundation for Treg cell-based . CD4CD25 Treg cells were sorted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cultured for 14 days in the presence of recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) and anti-CD3/CD28 beads, with or without 25 ng/ml rhIL-6. Next, the absolute count of Treg cells was determined, the stability and activity were detected by measuring the expression levels of forkhead box (Fox)P3 and CD39, and the suppressive function of Treg cells was investigated by assessing the suppression of T-effector cell proliferation by Treg cells after co-culture for  days. The number of Treg cells cultured in the presence of 25 ng/ml rhIL-6 for 14 days was reduced by 49.7% when compared with that of cells cultured without rhIL-6. Of the Treg cells continually cultured for 14 days without or with 25 ng/ml rhIL-6, 56.15 and 24.7% expressed FoxP3, respectively. There was no difference in the activity of the FoxP3 Treg cells after culture for 14 days without or with 25 ng/ml rhIL-6. The suppressive function of Treg cells tended to deteriorate in the presence of rhIL-6. In conclusion, IL-6 inhibited the proliferation and stability of Treg cells, suggesting that administration of increased numbers of Treg cells may be required during Treg cell-based .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590988>Durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide versus platinum-etoposide in first-line treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (CASPIAN): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial.</a></h2><p>Most patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) have extensive-stage disease at presentation, and prognosis remains poor. Recently,  has demonstrated clinical activity in extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). The CASPIAN trial assessed durvalumab, with or without tremelimumab, in combination with etoposide plus either cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum-etoposide) in treatment-naive patients with ES-SCLC.This randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial was done at 209 sites across 23 countries. Eligible patients were adults with untreated ES-SCLC, with WHO performance status 0 or 1 and measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1:1 ratio) to durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide; durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum-etoposide; or platinum-etoposide alone. All drugs were administered intravenously. Platinum-etoposide consisted of etoposide 80-100 mg/m on days 1-3 of each cycle with investigator's choice of either carboplatin area under the curve -6 mg/mL per min or cisplatin 75-80 mg/m (administered on day 1 of each cycle). Patients received up to four cycles of platinum-etoposide plus durvalumab 1500 mg with or without tremelimumab 75 mg every 3 weeks followed by maintenance durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks in the  groups and up to six cycles of platinum-etoposide every 3 weeks plus prophylactic cranial irradiation (investigator's discretion) in the platinum-etoposide group. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. We report results for the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group versus the platinum-etoposide group from a planned interim analysis. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of their assigned study treatment. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, , and is ongoing.Patients were enrolled between March 27, 2017, and May 29, 2018. 268 patients were allocated to the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group and 269 to the platinum-etoposide group. Durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide was associated with a significant improvement in overall survival, with a hazard ratio of 0·73 (95% CI 0·59-0·91; p=0·0047]); median overall survival was 13·0 months (95% CI 11·-14·8) in the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group versus 10·3 months (9·3-11·2) in the platinum-etoposide group, with 34% (26·9-41·0) versus 25% (18·4-31·6) of patients alive at 18 months. Any-cause adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 163 (62%) of 265 treated patients in the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group and 166 (62%) of 266 in the platinum-etoposide group; adverse events leading to death occurred in 13 (%) and 15 (6%) patients.First-line durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide significantly improved overall survival in patients with ES-SCLC versus a clinically relevant control group.

HCWs' behaviours as well as facilitators and barriers towards their vaccination for a number of VPDs were explored through an EU-wide survey.HCWs across the EU answered online survey that explored attitudes and behaviours towards vaccination for a number of VPDs. Response data were adjusted based on weights estimated by HCWs' country and working profession according to WHO statistics. The survey was delivered between October 2012 and April 2014.Analysis was based on responses from ,424 HCWs from 14 European countries. The majority (86.7%) had a positive attitude regarding immunizations. HCWs considered influenza (86.4%), viral hepatitis type B (71.9%) and tuberculosis (59.1%) as higher risk diseases for occupational exposure in the workplace. However, 43.8% reported not receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine in the last 10 years and 65.6% reported not receiving the pandemic influenza vaccine in 2009. Main enablers towards immunizations included believing in vaccine protection and easy, free of charge access to vaccines in the workplace. Barriers to up-to-date immunizations differed according to disease but included concerns about short- and long-term effects.Although the concept of mandatory vaccination seems to be favoured by many health professionals in Europe, it remains a controversial subject both among HCWs' profession categories and also among different countries. Interventions to increase vaccination among HCWs would benefit by tailoring their approach according to disease and target group.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31556463>Knowledge is power-Rational design of cancer .</a></h2><p>Discussion on how our increasing knowledge on tumor immunity and host defense mechanisms has drastically changed our ability to improve cancer outcomes through the rational design of immunotherapies.©2019 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545423>Availability of NK cell expansion agent combined with recombinant IL‑2 and IL‑15 stimulation on the expansion and high‑purity of NK cells in patients with immune‑related pancytopenia in vitro.</a></h2><p>Natural killer (NK) cells are a group of large granular lymphocytes that play an important regulatory role in innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Immune‑related pancytopenia (IRP) is a type of pancytopenia resulting from bone marrow hematopoietic cells that were destroyed or suppressed by auto‑antibodies. The specific mechanism of IRP is not clear. In the present study, it was identified that the percentage of NK cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes was decreased in patients with IRP. Subsequently, high purity NK cells were extracted from 6 untreated patients with IRP using the immunomagnetic beads sorting, magnetic‑activated cell‑sorting method, which were then cultured then in RPMI‑1640 medium containing 20% FBS. NK cell expansion agents, with or without recombinant interleukin (IL)‑15, were used to amplify high‑purity NK cells on the basic of recombinant IL‑2. Expression of the activated receptors NKG2‑D type II integral membrane protein (NKG2D) and natural killer cell p46‑related protein (NKp46), and the inhibitory receptors CD158a and NKG2‑A/NKG2‑B type II integral membrane protein (NKG2A), in CD56+ NK cells were detected by flow cytometry before and after cell culture. It was observed that treatment with an NK cell expansion agent combined with the stimulation of recombinant IL‑2 and recombinant IL‑15 could increase the number whilst maintaining the purity of NK cells. There were no significant changes in the expression of NKG2D, NKp46, NKG2A and CD158a in patients with IRP before and after NK cell culture.

The factors contributing to gene-modified T-cell expansion and the changes within the tumor microenvironment (TME) following T-cell infusion remain unclear. These studies address the immunological mechanisms of response and resistance in patients with SS treated with NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cells.Four cohorts were included to evaluate antigen expression and preconditioning on efficacy. Clinical responses were assessed by RECIST v1.1. Engineered T-cell persistence was determined by qPCR. Serum cytokines were evaluated by immunoassay. Transcriptomic analyses and immunohistochemistry were performed on tumor biopsies from patients before and after T-cell infusion. Gene-modified T-cells were detected within the TME via an RNAish assay.Responses across cohorts were affected by preconditioning and intra-tumoral NY-ESO-1 expression. Of the 42 patients reported (data cut-off 4June2018), 1 patient had a complete response, 14 patients had partial responses, 24 patients had stable disease, and 3 patients had progressive disease. The magnitude of gene-modified T-cell expansion shortly after infusion was associated with response in patients with high intra-tumoral NY-ESO-1 expression. Patients receiving a fludarabine-containing conditioning regimen experienced increases in serum IL-7 and IL-15. Prior to infusion, the TME exhibited minimal leukocyte infiltration; CD163 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were the dominant population. Modest increases in intra-tumoral leukocytes (≤%) were observed in a subset of subjects at approximately 8 weeks. Beyond 8 weeks post infusion, the TME was minimally infiltrated with a TAM-dominant leukocyte infiltrate. Tumor-associated antigens and antigen presentation did not significantly change within the tumor post-T-cell infusion. Finally, NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T cells trafficked to the TME and maintained cytotoxicity in a subset of patients.Our studies elucidate some factors that underpin response and resistance to NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cell therapy. From these data, we conclude that a lymphodepletion regimen containing high doses of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide is necessary for SPEAR T-cell persistence and efficacy.

Treatment options for NSCLC have been recently enriched by the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and data about their efficacy in patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC are discordant. This study assessed the routine efficacy of ICIs in advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC.All stage IV NSCLC patients treated in our institution from January 2016 to December 2017 with  were included in our analysis. We collected the status of KRAS and other mutations, as well as the type of ICI administered. We assessed four clinical outcomes: i) disease control rate (DCR), ii) partial response (PR), iii) progression-free survival (PFS) and iv) overall survival (OS).A total of 45 patients were initially identified but 7 were excluded due to insufficient clinical data, so 38 were included in the end. In the KRAS wild-type cohort, the DCR was 59% with 49% PR, while the PFS was 8.4 months and OS 16.8 months. Among KRAS mutated patients, results were more favourable, the DCR was 81%, with 62% PR. PFS was 13.6 months and OS was 18. months. The median follow-up was 24 months (17 to 34 months) and 7 patients were still on treatment at the time of analysis.Our data suggest that KRAS mutation is predictive of a superior response to .

Repeat chemotherapy shows decreasing efficacy and increasing toxicity with each course. Newer therapies targeting BRAF/MEK or Bruton's tyrosine kinase are effective but generally leave MRD. Rituximab has modest activity as a single agent and can achieve MRD-negative CR in combination with purine analogs, but there is significant toxicity from the chemotherapy. Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk (Moxe) is a biologic containing an antibody fragment (Fv) binding to CD22, attached to a portion of  exotoxin A. Binding to CD22 enables the toxin to enter and kill cells. Moxe is administered by 30-minute infusions on days 1, 3, and  of up to six cycles spaced 4 weeks apart. In phase I testing, 64% of 33 patients at the highest dose level achieved CR, most without MRD. Lack of MRD correlated with prolonged CR duration; of 11 MRD-negative CRs, 10 were still in CR after a median of 42 months of observation. In pivotal testing, 75% of 80 patients had a hematologic response, 41% with CR; 82% (27/33) of CRs were MRD-negative, and only 4 of the 27 MRD-negative patients relapsed during the follow-up period. Hemolytic uremic syndrome and capillary leak syndrome were each observed in 9% of patients, all reversible. In September 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Moxe for the treatment of relapsed/refractory HCL after ≥2 prior therapies. Moxe is undergoing further development in combination with rituximab. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) has effective treatments including purine analogs with and without rituximab, and oral inhibitors of BRAF, MEK and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Despite these therapies, relapse occurs, and moxetumomab pasudotox has an important role in relapsed and refractory HCL because of its ability to achieve high rates of complete remissions (CRs) without chemotherapy; most of these CRs are without minimal residual disease (MRD). CR duration is enhanced in patients who achieve eradication of MRD. To improve the efficacy of this recombinant immunotoxin, a phase I trial is underway in combination with rituximab to reduce tumor burden and decrease immunogenicity.Published 2019.

This inefficacy might be due to inefficient generation of anti-tumor cellular immune responses.This study aimed to assess the potential of using self-assembled nanofibers as a new vaccine platform to elicit potent HPV antigen - specific anti-tumor immunity.A HPV16 E7 peptide was chemically appended to the N terminus of self-assembling peptide Q11. The nanofibers were prepared and used to immunize mice through a preventive or therapeutic strategy in a TC-1 graft tumor model.Preventive immunization with nanofibers almost completely suppressed the growth of primarily grafted TC-1 tumors and even a re-challenge of tumor cells after a six-week rest. Therapeutic immunization significantly increased the levels of effector Th1 cells, CTLs and the cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α in E7 peptide-stimulated splenocytes, and the immunization reduced Th2, MDSC and IL-4 contents compared to the controls. The nanofiber immunization significantly suppressed the growth of established tumors and achieved 66.7% and 50% tumor-free in mice carrying 2-3 mm tumors and even larger tumors with a diameter of -6 mm respectively. In addition, the nanofibers were more efficient than the corresponding unassembled peptides for the treatment of established larger size tumors.The results indicated that self-assembling nanofibers could elicit robust HPV antigen -specific anti-tumor cellular immunity and are a potent antigen delivery system for HPV related tumor vaccines.© 2019 Li et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584722>Site-specific response patterns, pseudoprogression, and acquired resistance in patients with melanoma treated with ipilimumab combined with anti-PD-1 therapy.</a></h2><p>Patients with metastatic melanoma have variable responses to combination ipilimumab and nivolumab. The objectives of this study were to examine the patterns of response and survival in patients treated with combination ipilimumab and anti-PD-1 therapy (IPI + PD1) and to explore the nature of pseudoprogression and acquired resistance.Patients with metastatic melanoma who received treatment with first-line IPI + PD1 had all metastases ≥ mm measured on computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging studies. The lesional response rate (LRR) and the overall response rate (ORR) were determined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1.In total, 140 patients who had 833 metastases were studied. The ORR and the overall complete response (CR) rate decreased as tumor burden or the number of metastases increased. Metastases that had a CR (49%) were smaller than metastases without a CR (median, 13 vs 17 mm; P < .0001). Soft-tissue and lung metastases had the highest LRR (79% and 77%, respectively), whereas liver metastases had the lowest (46%). In multivariate analysis, patients with lung metastases had superior ORR (odds ratio [OR], 2.75; P = .02) and progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; P = .02), whereas those with liver metastases had inferior ORR (OR, 0.33; P = .02), progression-free survival (HR, 4.03; P < .01), and overall survival (HR, 3.17; P = .01). Pseudoprogression occurred in one-third of patients who had progressive disease as their best response, with an overall survival that was comparable to that of patients without disease progression.

The overall objective response rate (ORR) was 17.6%, the disease control rate was 58.%, and the median time to progression was .2 months. The ORR of patients with PD-1 blockade-based combination therapy, without liver metastases and higher level of C-reactive protein (CRP) before PD-1 blockade, is higher than that of those not. Univariate analysis based on clinical features showed that ECOG scores, liver metastasis, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and CRP levels were the factors affecting time to progression (TTP). Multivariate analysis showed that elevated CRP before PD-1 blockade was an independent predictive factor for ORR of PD-1 blockade therapy (=0.009), while only Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score was an independent predictor for TTP (=0.032).

However, the likelihood and predictive factors associated with successful immune suppression discontinuation after HCT are poorly understood.To examine factors associated with successful immune suppression discontinuation and risk for immune suppression discontinuation failure under conventional HCT approaches and develop a practical tool to estimate successful immune suppression discontinuation likelihood at the clinical point of care.Using long-term follow-up data from 2 national Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trial Network studies (N = 827), a multistate model was developed to investigate the probability and variables associated with immune suppression discontinuation success. The study began in July 2015, and analyses were completed in August 2019.Immune suppression discontinuation and immune suppression discontinuation failure.Of the 827 patients included in the analysis, 456 were men (55.1%). Median age at transplant was 44 (range, <1-67) years. With median follow-up of 72 (range, 11-124) months, 20.0% of the patients were alive and not receiving immune suppression at  years. Older recipient age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] of >50 vs <30 years, 0.27, 99% CI, 0.14-0.50; P < .001), mismatched unrelated donor (aOR, mismatched unrelated vs matched related, 0.37; 99% CI, 0.14-0.97; P = .008), peripheral blood graft (aOR of peripheral blood graft vs bone marrow, 0.46; 99% CI, 0.26-0.82; P < .001), and advanced stage disease (aOR of advanced vs early disease, 0.45; 99% CI, 0.23-0.86, P = 0.002), were significantly associated with decreased odds of immune suppression discontinuation. Failed attempts at immune suppression discontinuation (127 patients [37.1% of total immune suppression discontinuation events]) resulting in GVHD were significantly associated with use of peripheral blood stem cells (HR, 2.62; 99% CI, 1.30-.29; P < .001), prior GVHD, and earlier immune suppression discontinuation attempts. Earlier immune suppression discontinuation was not associated with protection from cancer relapse after HCT (adjusted hazard ratio for discontinuation vs not, 1.95; 99% CI, 0.88-4.31; P = .03).Dynamic prediction models were developed to provide future immune suppression discontinuation probability according to individual patient characteristics.Successful immune suppression discontinuation is uncommon in the setting of peripheral blood stem cell grafts. The data suggest earlier attempts at ISD conferred no long-term benefit, given frequent ISD failure, limited subsequent success after initial failed ISD attempt, and no evidence of relapse reduction.

Foremost among these successful immunotherapies are monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which target immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) molecules, most prominently cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and its major ligand, PD-L1. These immunotherapeutic agents are, however, often associated with the occurrence of immune-mediated toxicities known as immune-related adverse events (IRAEs). The incidence of severe toxicities increases substantially when these agents are used together, particularly with CTLA-4 in combination with PD-1 or PD-L1 antagonists. Accordingly, dissociating the beneficial anti-tumor therapeutic activity of these agents from the emergence of IRAEs represents a significant challenge to attaining the optimum efficacy of ICI-targeted  of cancer. This situation is compounded by an increasing awareness, possibly unsurprising, that both the beneficial and harmful effects of ICI-targeted therapies appear to result from an over-reactive immune system. Nevertheless, this challenge may not be insurmountable. This contention is based on acquisition of recent insights into the role of the gut microbiome and its products as determinants of the efficacy of ICI-targeted , as well as an increasing realization of the enigmatic involvement of Th17 cells in both anti-tumor activity and the pathogenesis of some types of IRAEs. Evidence linking the beneficial and harmful activities of ICI-targeted , recent mechanistic insights focusing on the gut microbiome and Th17 cells, as well as strategies to attenuate IRAEs in the setting of retention of therapeutic activity, therefore represent the major thrusts of this review.Copyright © 2019 Anderson, Theron and Rapoport.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570517>Regorafenib in Combination with First-Line Chemotherapy for Metastatic Esophagogastric Cancer.</a></h2><p>Angiogenesis is critical to gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma growth and metastasis. Regorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor targeting angiogenic and stromal receptor tyrosine kinases. We evaluated whether regorafenib augments the antitumor effect of first-line chemotherapy in metastatic esophagogastric cancer.Patients with previously untreated metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma received -fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) every 14 days and regorafenib 160 mg daily on days 4 to 10 of each 14-day cycle. The primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS). To identify predictive biomarkers of outcome, we examined correlations between genomic characteristics of sequenced pretreatment tumors and PFS.Between August 2013 and November 2014, 36 patients with metastatic esophagogastric cancer were accrued to this single-center phase II study (). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (36%), leucopenia (11%) and hypertension (8%). The 6-month PFS was 53% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38%-71%), the objective response rate was 54% (95% CI, 37%-70%), and the disease control rate was 77% (95% CI, 67%-94%). Next-generation sequencing did not identify any genomic alterations significantly correlated with response, and there was no association between homologous recombination deficiency and PFS with platinum-based chemotherapy.Regorafenib (one week on-one week off schedule) is well tolerated in combination with first-line FOLFOX but does not improve 6-month PFS relative to historical control.Prognosis for metastatic esophagogastric cancer remains poor despite modern systemic therapy regimens. This phase II trial indicates that the combination of regorafenib and FOLFOX is well tolerated but does not add to the efficacy of first-line chemotherapy in metastatic esophagogastric cancer. Notably, recently reported data suggest potential synergy between regorafenib and the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab. As this study demonstrates that regorafenib plus FOLFOX is safe, and combined chemotherapy and  show favorable toxicity profiles, future studies combining  with regorafenib and chemotherapy may be feasible.© AlphaMed Press 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31539077>Association of Tumor Protein p53 and Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated Comutation With Response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and Mortality in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.</a></h2><p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can elicit durable antitumor responses in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but only 20% to 25% of patients respond to treatment. As important genes in the DNA damage response pathway, comutation in the tumor protein p53 (TP53) and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) genes may be associated with genomic instability and hypermutation. However, the prevalence of TP53 and ATM comutation and its association with response to ICIs are not fully understood.To examine the prevalence of the TP53 and ATM comutation, the potential mechanism, and its association with response to ICIs among patients with NSCLC.This multiple-cohort study included patients with NSCLC from the Geneplus Institute, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) databases and from the POPLAR and OAK randomized controlled trials. Samples in the Geneplus cohort were collected and analyzed from April 30, 2015, through February 28, 2019. Data from TCGA, the MSKCC, and the POPLAR and OAK cohorts were obtained on January 1, 2019, and analyzed from January 1 to April 10, 2019. Next-generation sequencing assays were performed on tumor samples by the Geneplus Institute. Genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical data were obtained from TCGA and MSKCC databases.Comprehensive genetic profiling was performed to determine the prevalence of TP53 and ATM comutation and its association with prognosis and response to ICIs.The main outcomes were TP53 and ATM comutation frequency, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, gene set enrichment analysis, and immune profile in NSCLC.Patients with NSCLC analyzed in this study included 2020 patients in the Geneplus cohort (mean [SD] age, 59. [10.] years; 1168 [57.8%] men), 1031 patients in TCGA cohort (mean [SD] age, 66.2 [9.] years; 579 [56.2%] men), 1527 patients in the MSKCC cohort (662 [43.4%] men), 350 patients in the MSKCC cohort who were treated with ICIs (mean [SD] age, 61.4 [13.8] years; 170 [48.6%] men), and 853 patients in the POPLAR and OAK cohort (mean [SD] age, 63.0 [9.1] years; 527 [61.8%] men). Sites of TP53 and ATM comutation were found scattered throughout the genes, and no significant difference was observed in the frequency of TP53 and ATM comutation within the histologic subtypes and driver genes. In  independent cohorts of patients with NSCLC, TP53 and ATM comutation was associated with a significantly higher tumor mutation burden compared with the sole mutation and with no mutation (TCGA, MSKCC, Geneplus, and POPLAR and OAK cohort). Among patients treated with ICIs in the MSKCC cohort, TP53 and ATM comutation was associated with better OS than a single mutation and no mutation among patients with any cancer (median OS: TP53 and ATM comutation, not reached; TP53 mutation alone, 14.0 months; ATM mutation alone, 40.0 months; no mutation, 22.0 months; P = .001; NSCLC median OS: TP53 and ATM comutation, not reached; TP53 mutation alone, 11.0 months; ATM mutation alone, 16.0 months; no mutation, 14.0 months; P = .24). Similar results were found in the POPLAR and OAK cohort in which the disease control benefit rate, progression-free survival, and OS were all greater in patients with the TP53 and ATM comutation compared with the other 3 groups (median progression-free survival: TP53 and ATM comutation, 10.4 months; TP53 mutation, 1.6 months; ATM mutation, 3. months; no mutation, 2.8 months; P = .01; median OS: TP53 and ATM comutation, 22.1 months; TP53 mutation, 8.3 months; ATM mutation, 15.8 months; no mutation, 15.3 months; P = .002).This study's findings suggest that the TP53 and ATM comutation occurs in a subgroup of patients with NSCLC and is associated with an increased tumor mutation burden and response to ICIs. This suggests that TP53 and ATM comutation may have implications as a biomarker for guiding ICI treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552832>CEA Plasmid as Therapeutic DNA Vaccination against Colorectal Cancer.</a></h2><p>Human colorectal cancer cells overexpress carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). CEA is a glycoprotein which has shown to be a promising vaccine target for  against colorectal cancer.To design a DNA vaccine harboring CEA antigen and evaluate its effect on inducing immunity against colorectal cancer cells in tumor bearing mice.In the first step the coding sequence of the CEA was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. The mice were injected with the vaccine construct and the immune responses were monitored during the experiment period. The specific IgG anti-CEA, IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-4 were measured by ELISA and levels of IFN-γ was detected by ELISpot assay. The lymphocyte proliferation was assessed using a -bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) cell proliferation assay kit.Immunization of the mice with the CEA plasmid resulted in stimulation of CEA-specific T cell and antibody responses. The serum level of specific IgG antibodies against CEA was increased in immunized mice. Moreover, the injection of CEA plasmid led to the stimulation of T-helper-1 by increase in the secretion of IFN-γ, IL-2 and lymphocyte proliferation response.As the CEA DNA vaccine displayed encouraging antitumor effects, therefore, we suggest that it can be a potential therapeutic modality for colorectal cancer and is worthy of further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613356>Safety and efficacy of mucosal  using human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 E7-expressing Lactobacillus-based vaccine for the treatment of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL): the study protocol of a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial (MILACLE study).</a></h2><p>We developed an HPV16 E7-expressing Lactobacillus-based therapeutic vaccine, IGMKK16E7, to elicit mucosal E7-specific TH1 cellular immune responses.

All 3,000 new cases of cervical cancers are attributable to HPV infections. Cervical cancer prevention is based on the combination of two complementary strategies: vaccination of 11 to 14-years-old girls against HPV and organized screening of cervical cancer for women between 25 and 65 years old. In France, the vaccination coverage rate -VCR- against HPV for 2 vaccine doses is less than 25% while it reaches more than 80% in the United Kingdom, Portugal, Australia, etc. This low level of VCR can be explained by the mistrust in these vaccines especially regarding their effectiveness and safety. However, more than 10 years after their commercialization, HPV vaccines have already demonstrated, in many countries, their effectiveness against HPV infections, genital warts and precancerous cervical lesions. In addition, no association between vaccines and autoimmune diseases has been demonstrated, either by national or international surveillance authorities, or by scientific publications, after the commercialization of 200 million doses worldwide. As the International Papillomavirus Society has declared that the combination of a high VCR against HPV and a high participation in cervical cancer screening, combined with appropriate treatment, can lead to the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem, it is important to better communicate the scientific findings in order to better understand vaccination's benefits.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653980>Immune subtyping of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma: a new biomarker and an immune shift during disease progression.</a></h2><p>Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma is an aggressive lymphoma that is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. Although some extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma patients have shown responses to immune checkpoint blockade, biomarkers for predicting extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma patient response to  have not yet been defined. To understand the tumor immune microenvironment, we analyzed the expression of 579 immune-related genes and characterized the immune cells using immunohistochemistries and in situ hybridization for EBER. Based on comprehensive analyses, we developed an immune subtyping model that classifies extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma patients into four tumor immune microenvironment subgroups using three immunohistochemical markers (FoxP3, PD-L1, and CD68). The four tumor immune microenvironment subgroups were named immune tolerance, immune evasion-A, immune evasion-B, and immune silenced. The immune tolerance group was characterized by high-Treg counts and was frequently observed in early stage, and nasal extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. The immune evasion group showed high cytotoxic T-cell counts and high PD-L1 expression but low Treg counts. In the immune-silenced group, almost all immune responses were exhausted, most patients were at an advanced stage, and had the poorest disease prognosis among the tumor immune microenvironment subgroups. In some patients (n = 3), a shift in the tumor immune microenvironment subgroup classification was observed in sequential biopsies. The response rate to pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, was 100% (1/1) in the immune tolerance group, 60% (3/) in the immune evasion group, and 0% (0/) in the immune-silenced group. We classified extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma into four tumor immune microenvironment subgroups using a new classification system.

Additionally, mismatch Repair (MMR) deficiency appears to enhance the response to checkpoints blockade in several tumors. The aim of the present study was to analyze programmed death‑1 ligand 1 (PD‑L1) expression in MM and to characterize the TME. This could help to understand the immune response, and evaluate its prognostic and predictive values. We also investigated MMR protein expression. We retrospectively analyzed 55 mesotheliomas to determine PD‑L1, CD4+, CD8+, mutL homolog 1 (MLH1), mutS homolog 2 (MSH2), mutS homolog 6 (MSH6) and PMS1 homolog 2, mismatch repair system component (PMS2) expression. We used an immunoscore (1+, 2+ and 3+) to evaluate tumor‑infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).

IL-33 is released from stressed or necrotic cells. Initially, IL-33 was described as an inducer of the humoral immune response, which activated Th2 cells and mast cells involved in modulating inflammation and allergic reactions. In addition, IL-33 acts as a stimulator of the Th1, NK, and CD8T cells, which induce a cytotoxic immune response against intracellular pathogens. It was recently discovered that this cytokine is involved in the development of cancer by performing both pro- and antitumor functions. IL-33 can directly affect tumor cells and provokes their proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Moreover, IL-33 stimulates carcinogenesis by remodeling the tumor microenvironment and inducing angiogenesis, thus contributing to the generation of immunosuppressive conditions. At the same time, IL-33 causes tumor infiltration with cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes and natural killers, which leads to cytolysis-mediated cancer cell death. This review describes the versatile role of the IL-33/ST2 cascade in the development of experimental and clinical tumors.

Hence, we sought to generate human norovirus-specific T-cells (NSTs) that can recognize different viral sequences.NSTs were generated from peripheral blood of healthy donors by stimulation with overlapping peptide libraries spanning the entire coding sequence of the norovirus genome.We successfully generated T-cells targeting multiple norovirus antigens with a mean 4.2 ± 0.-fold expansion after 10 days. NSTs were comprised of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells that expressed markers for central memory and effector memory phenotype with minimal expression of co-inhibitory molecules, and were polyfunctional based on cytokine production. We identified novel CD4 and CD8-restricted immunodominant epitopes within NS6 and VP1 antigens.

The PD-L1 expression in tumor cells as detected by immunohistochemistry is a predictive biomarker in some solid tumors, but appears insufficient as prognostic or predictive factor of response to ICIs in metastatic melanomas.We investigated whether the presence and the features of pretreatment CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) could be a complementary prognostic or predictive biomarker in patients with metastatic melanoma.In this retrospective study, we evaluated the association of PD-L1 expression ≥% of tumor cells combined with TILs features (CD8, CD28, Ki67) with the overall survival (OS) among 51 patients treated with ICIs and 54 patients treated with other treatment options (non-ICIs).PD-L1 positivity was observed in 33% and 39% of primary melanomas and matched metastases, respectively, with, however, poor concordance between the primary and the matched metastatic site (κ=0.283). No significant association was noted between PD-L1 expression and CD8+TILs profile analyzed as single markers and OS or response to . Instead, their combined analysis in primary melanoma samples showed that the PD-L1-/CD8+ status was significantly associated with prolonged OS in the whole population (P=0.04) and in the subgroup treated with non-ICIs (P=0.009). Conversely, the PD-L1+/CD8+ status was a good prognostic factor in patients treated with ICIs (P=0.022), whereas was significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients treated with non-ICIs (P=0.014). While the expression of CD28 was not related to outcome, the Ki67 expression was significantly associated to poor OS in the subgroup CD8+TIL+/PD-L1- (P=0.02).The pre-treatment combination of PD-L1 expression with the level of CD8+TILs could better assess OS and predict therapeutic response of patients with metastatic melanoma treated either by  or other treatments regimens.© 2019 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588654>Neuronal antibodies in adult patients with new-onset seizures: A prospective study.</a></h2><p> in addition to antiepileptic drugs can improve seizure freedom rates in autoimmune epilepsy, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis. A diagnosis of autoimmune epilepsy can be supported by presence of serum antibodies to neuronal antigens. We asked how often neuronal antibodies are found in the serum of unselected adult patients with new-onset seizures and whether such testing could improve detection of autoimmune epilepsy.We included 44 patients over the age of 25 presenting after at least one unprovoked seizure to the Neurology Clinic at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. The median time between the first-ever seizure in life and the serum sampling was 50 days (range 22-11,000). Antibody testing in serum was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The patients were followed for at least 1 year.Epilepsy could be diagnosed already at the first visit in 21/44 patients (47.7%). Two patients (4.%) were positive for neuronal antibodies: one against contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR-2) and one against glutamate acid decarboxylase (GAD). Three patients (6.7%) displayed very weak immunoreactivity that was deemed clinically insignificant. One of the antibody-positive patients had only a single seizure. The other had a focal cortical dysplasia and was seizure-free on levetiracetam. None of the five patients with antibodies or immunoreactivity displayed any feature of autoimmune epilepsy.We conclude that indiscriminate testing in patients presenting to a first seizure clinic with new-onset seizures or epilepsy is unlikely to improve detection of autoimmune epilepsy.© 2019 The Authors.
