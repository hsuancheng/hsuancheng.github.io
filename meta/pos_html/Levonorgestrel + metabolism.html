We previously showed in macaques that there is a significantly higher simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) acquisition rate in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, which presents a naturally high-progesterone state, and this may be attributable to altered expression of innate immune factors. We hypothesized that progestin-based contraception, especially depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), would, in a similar way, affect mucosal immune factors that influence HIV acquisition risk.We used a pig-tailed macaque model to evaluate the effects of two progestin-based contraceptives, DMPA, and  (LNG)/ethinyl estradiol (EE)-based combined oral contraceptives (COCs), on innate mucosal factors. We compared the vaginal epithelial thickness data from previous studies and used cytokine profiling and microarray analysis to evaluate contraception-induced molecular changes in the vagina.The administration of DMPA caused a reduction in the thickness of the vaginal epithelium relative to that of the follicular or luteal phase. DMPA also induced a significant increase in vaginal levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Both DMPA- and LNG-based contraception induced a signature of gene expression similar to that of the luteal phase, only more exacerbated, including widespread downregulation of antiviral genes.The use of progestin-based contraception might engender a milieu that poses an increased risk of HIV acquisition as compared to both the luteal and follicular phases of the menstrual cycle.Published 2018.

A wide range of hormonal contraceptives (HCs), which differ in composition, concentration of the progestin component, frequency of dosage, and method of administration, is currently available globally. However, the options are rather limited in settings with restricted economic resources that frequently overlap with areas of high HIV-1 prevalence. The predominant contraceptive used in sub-Saharan Africa is the progestin-only three-monthly injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate. Determination of whether HCs affect HIV-1 acquisition has been hampered by behavioral differences potentially confounding clinical observational data. Meta-analysis of these studies shows a significant association between depot medroxyprogesterone acetate use and increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition, raising important concerns. No association was found for combined oral contraceptives containing , nor for the two-monthly injectable contraceptive norethisterone enanthate, although data for norethisterone enanthate are limited. Susceptibility to HIV-1 and other sexually transmitted infections may, however, be dependent on the type of progestin present in the formulation. Several underlying biological mechanisms that may mediate the effect of HCs on HIV-1 and other sexually transmitted infection acquisition have been identified in clinical, animal, and ex vivo studies. A substantial gap exists in the translation of basic research into clinical practice and public health policy. To bridge this gap, we review the current knowledge of underlying mechanisms and biological effects of commonly used progestins. The review sheds light on issues critical for an informed choice of progestins for the identification of safe, effective, acceptable, and affordable contraceptive methods.Copyright © 2018 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25943176>Effect of mavoglurant (AFQ056), a selective mGluR5 antagonist, on the pharmacokinetics of a combined oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and  in healthy women.</a></h2><p>To compare the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of a combination oral contraceptive (OC) when given alone or concomitantly with the selective metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist mavoglurant (AFQ056).This open-label, fixed-sequence, two-period study included 30 healthy female subjects aged 18-40 years. In period 1, a single oral dose of an OC containing 30 μg ethinyl estradiol (EE)/150 μg  (LNG) was administered alone. In period 2, the OC was administered with a clinically relevant multiple dose of mavoglurant 100 mg b.i.d. under steady-state conditions. Plasma concentrations of EE and LNG were measured up to 72 hours post administration, and the PK parameters Cmax and AUClast were estimated using noncompartmental methods.The geometric mean ratios of EE Cmax and AUClast obtained with and without mavoglurant were 0.97 (90% confidence interval (CI): 0.90-1.06) and 0.94 (90% CI: 0.86-1.03), respectively. The corresponding Cmax and AUClast for LNG were 0.81 (90% CI: 0.75-0.87) and 0.68 (90% CI: 0.63-0.73), respectively.In conclusion, EE PK was unchanged, whereas Cmax and AUClast of LNG were 19% and 32% lower, respectively, when given with mavoglurant Further investigation regarding the impact on contraceptive efficacy is warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28994639>Migraine, menopause and hormone replacement therapy.</a></h2><p>Perimenopause marks a period of increased migraine prevalence in women and many women also report troublesome vasomotor symptoms. Migraine is affected by fluctuating estrogen levels with evidence to support estrogen 'withdrawal' as a trigger of menstrual attacks of migraine without aura, while high estrogen levels can trigger migraine aura. Maintaining a stable estrogen environment with estrogen replacement can benefit estrogen-withdrawal migraine particularly in women who would also benefit from relief of vasomotor symptoms. In contrast to contraceptive doses of ethinylestradiol, migraine aura does not contraindicate use of physiological doses of natural estrogen. In women with migraine with or without aura, using only the lowest doses of transdermal estrogen necessary to control vasomotor symptoms minimizes the risk of unwanted side effects. Cyclical progestogens can have an adverse effect on migraine so continuous progestogens, as provided by the  intrauterine system or in continuous combined transdermal preparation, are preferred. There are no data on the effect of micronized progesterone on migraine, either cyclical or continuous. Non-hormonal options for both conditions are limited but there is evidence of efficacy for escitalopram and venflaxine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26007631>Haemostatic and  impact of estradiol pills and drospirenone-containing ethinylestradiol pills vs. -containing ethinylestradiol pills: A literature review.</a></h2><p>Since its introduction 50 years ago, the contraceptive pill has continuously evolved to decrease the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with its use. An increased risk of VTE still remains, however. Other concerns, such as effects on lipid and carbohydrate , have also been reported. In this study we compared two reference combined oral contraceptives (COCs) containing ethinylestradiol (EE)/ (LNG) and EE/drospirenone (DRSP) with COCs containing estradiol (E2) (estradiol valerate [E2V]/dienogest [DNG] and E2/nomegestrol acetate [NOMAC]). They were evaluated according to their influence on recognised haemostatic and  markers.A literature search of the MEDLINE/PubMed database was conducted for head-to-head studies. EE/LNG was chosen as the comparator pill.The haemostatic impact of E2 pills and EE/LNG has been extensively compared, in contrast to that of EE/DRSP and EE/LNG. Changes in haemostatic and  marker levels between EE/LNG and E2V/DNG were generally not statistically significant. E2/NOMAC showed statistically significantly favourable results on haemostatic markers and had a neutral effect on carbohydrate and lipid  when compared with EE/LNG.E2/NOMAC exhibits less haemostatic and  impact than EE/LNG and other COCs, suggesting that it may be a promising candidate to reduce residual VTE risk associated with COC use. Confirmation from a well-powered prospective clinical trial is, however, needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30822501>Differential  of clinically-relevant progestogens in cell lines and tissue: Implications for biological mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Steroid hormones regulate a variety of physiological processes, including reproductive function, and are widely used in hormonal therapy. Synthetic progestogens, or progestins, were designed to mimic progesterone (P) for use in contraception and hormonal replacement therapy in women. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and norethisterone (NET) are the most widely used injectable contraceptives in the developing world, while other progestins such as  (LNG), etonogestrel (ETG) and nestorone (NES) are used in or being developed for other forms of contraception. As concerns remain about the most appropriate choice of progestin and dosage, and the associated side-effects, the mechanisms and biological effects of progestins are frequently investigated in various in vitro mammalian cell line and tissue models. However, whether progestogens are differentially metabolised in different cell types in vivo or in vitro is unknown. For nine mammalian cell lines commonly used to investigate progestogen mechanisms of action, we developed and validated an ultra-high performance supercritical fluid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPSFC-MS/MS) protocol for simultaneously quantifying the  of the above-mentioned steroids. We show for the first time that, while 50-100% of P was metabolised within 24 h in all cell lines, the  of the progestins is progestin- and cell line-specific. We also show that MPA and NET are significantly metabolised in human cervical tissue, but to a lesser extent than P. Taken together, our findings suggest that differential progestogen  may play a role in cell-specific therapeutic and side-effects. Relative affinities for binding to steroid receptors as well as potencies, efficacies and biocharacters for transcriptional activity of progestins, relative to P, are most frequently determined using some of the cell lines investigated. Our results, however, suggest that differential  of progestins and P may confound these results. In particular,  may under-estimate the receptor-mediated intrinsic in vitro binding and dose-response values and predicted endogenous physiological effects of P.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies also suggest that nicotine, a major tobacco alkaloid, may worsen or improve atherothrombotic CVD. Altered hemorheology, prothrombotic and pro-inflammatory biomarkers, have been implicated in the development of atherothrombotic CVD events. However, the effect of non-smoking nicotine exposure on these biomarkers during COC treatment is not yet established. We therefore sought to determine the effects of nicotine exposure during COC treatment on these biomarkers, and also tested the hypothesis that the nicotine effects would be glucocorticoid-dependent.Female Sprague-Dawley rats aged 10 weeks were given (po) vehicle, low-dose nicotine (0.1mg/kg) or high-dose nicotine (1.0mg/kg) with or without COC steroids (5.0μg/kg ethinylestradiol and 25.0μg/kg ) daily for 6 weeks.COC treatment or nicotine exposure led to increased insulin resistance (IR), hemorheological (blood viscosity, hematocrit and plasma viscosity), prothrombotic (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1), pro-inflammatory (uric acid, C-reactive protein, neutrophil/lymphocyte and platelet/lymphocyte ratios) biomarkers and corticosterone. However, these effects except that on corticosterone were abrogated by nicotine exposure during COC treatment.Our study indicates that nicotine- or COC-induced IR may be mediated via inflammatory/thrombotic pathway. The results imply that nicotine exposure could impact negatively on atherothrombotic biomarkers in COC non-users, whereas the impact in COC users could be positive. The results also suggest that the anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and blood viscosity-lowering effects of nicotine exposure during COC use is circulating glucocorticoid-independent.Copyright © 2016.

The primary outcome was the frequency of cardiovascular and gynecologic side effects due to the LNG-IUS over the year after LNG-IUS insertion. The secondary outcomes were the changes in menstrual blood loss and biomarkers, e.g., white blood cell count and the levels of C-reactive protein, hemoglobin and brain natriuretic peptide. We also evaluated the 24-month continuation rate of LNG-IUS.A total of 34 women were prospectively followed-up, including two women with pulmonary hypertension. No cardiovascular side effects were identified during the 1 year after LNG-IUS insertion, other than one case of mild vasovagal reaction at insertion. Neither the white blood cell count nor the C-reactive protein value increased after LNG-IUS insertion. The menstrual blood loss was decreased in most subjects and the median hemoglobin levels increased significantly within 1 year after insertion (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002). Moreover, brain natriuretic peptide levels tended to decrease in correspondence with the hemoglobin elevation (P = 0.074). The 24-month LNG-IUS continuation rate was 97% (95% confidence interval 85-100).No clinically significant cardiovascular event was identified during the 1 year after 52-mg LNG-IUS insertion among women with cardiovascular disease. The 52-mg LNG-IUS may have specific favorable effects by decreasing the risk of iron deficiency anemia in these women.© 2018 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28126541>Pharmacokinetics of  and ulipristal acetate emergency contraception in women with normal and obese body mass index.</a></h2><p>This study compares the pharmacokinetics (PK) of  (LNG) emergency contraceptive (EC) and ulipristal acetate (UPA)-EC between normal-body mass index (BMI) and obese-BMI women.This prospective, randomized crossover study evaluates the PK of women after single doses of LNG-EC (1.5mg) and UPA-EC (30mg). Study procedures took place during clinical research unit admissions, where participants received a standardized meal and each study drug, in random order, during two separate 24-h admissions. Study staff collected 14 blood specimens (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24 and 48h). We evaluated serum concentrations of LNG and UPA using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy and estimated the PK parameters of both drugs using noncompartmental analysis. The main outcome of this study was a comparison of between-group differences in AUC.Thirty-two women completed the study (16 in each group). Among normal-BMI and obese-BMI participants, the mean BMIs were 22.0 (range 18.8-24.6) and 34.3 (range 30.6-39.9), respectively. After LNG-EC, mean AUC and maximum concentration (C) were 50% lower among obese-BMI women than among normal-BMI women (AUC 100.8 vs. 208.5ng*h/mL, IQR 35.8, IQR 74.2, p≤.01; C 10.8 vs. 18.2ng/mL, p=.01). After UPA-EC, AUC and C were similar between obese-BMI and normal-BMI women (AUC 362.5 vs. 293.5ng*h/mL, IQR 263.2, IQR 112.5, p=.15; C 95.6 vs. 89.3ng/mL, p=.70).After a single dose of EC, obese-BMI women are exposed to lower concentrations of LNG and similar concentrations of UPA, when compared to normal-BMI women.Differences in LNG-EC PK by BMI group may underlie and account for the lower LNG-EC efficacy reported among obese-BMI women, but modest differences in UPA-EC PK by BMI group provide less support for variable efficacy. A pharmacodynamic study may be able to clarify whether these PK differences account for observed differences in LNG-EC and UPA-EC efficacy.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A total of 103 women with endometriosis-associated pain diagnosed by surgery, transvaginal ultrasound and/or magnetic resonance imaging were included. Endometrial nerve fibre density and serum levels of CA-125 and soluble CD23 were assessed before and after six months of using the allocated method and were correlated to 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for non-cyclical pelvic pain and dysmenorrhoea.Both contraceptive methods significantly reduced concentrations of serum soluble CD23 and endometrial nerve fibre density (p < .001); however, CA-125 was significantly reduced only among users of the ENG implant (p < .05). No correlation was observed between reduction of biomarkers and improvement of VAS pain and dysmenorrhoea scores. No differences were observed between the ENG implant and the LNG-IUS.Both progestin-only contraceptives significantly reduced two out of the three biomarkers evaluated.

To evaluate their impact on immune responses to sequential IAV infections, adult female mice were treated with placebo or one of two progestins, P4 or  (LNG), and infected with a mouse-adapted H1N1 (maH1N1) virus. Treatment with P4 or LNG reduced morbidity but had no effect on pulmonary virus titers during primary H1N1 infection compared to placebo treatment. In serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, total anti-IAV IgG and IgA titers and virus-neutralizing antibody titers but not hemagglutinin stalk antibody titers were lower in progestin-treated mice than placebo-treated mice. Females were challenged 6 weeks later with either an maH1N1 drift variant (maH1N1dv) or maH3N2 IAV. The level of protection following infection with the maH1N1dv was similar among all groups. In contrast, following challenge with maH3N2, progestin treatment reduced survival as well as the numbers and activity of H1N1- and H3N2-specific memory CD8 T cells, including tissue-resident cells, compared with placebo treatment. In contrast to primary IAV infection, progestin treatment increased the titers of neutralizing and IgG antibodies against both challenge viruses compared with those achieved with placebo treatment. While the immunomodulatory properties of progestins protected immunologically naive female mice from the severe outcomes from IAV infection, it made them more susceptible to secondary challenge with a heterologous IAV, despite improving their antibody responses against a secondary IAV infection. Taken together, the immunomodulatory effects of progestins differentially regulate the outcome of infection depending on exposure history. The impact of hormone-based contraceptives on the outcome of infectious diseases outside the reproductive tract is rarely considered. Using a mouse model, we have made the novel observation that treatment with either progesterone or a synthetic analog found in hormonal contraceptives, , impacts sequential influenza A virus infection by modulating antibody responses and decreasing the numbers and activity of memory CD8 T cells. Progestins reduced the antibody responses during primary H1N1 virus infection but increased antibody titers following a sequential infection with either an H1N1 drift variant or an H3N2 virus. Following challenge with an H3N2 virus, female mice treated with progestins experienced greater mortality with increased pulmonary inflammation and reduced numbers and activity of CD8 T cells. This study suggests that progestins significantly affect adaptive immune responses to influenza A virus infection, with their effect on the outcome of infection depending on exposure history.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26795917>Aqueous exposure to the progestin, , alters anal fin development and reproductive behavior in the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki).</a></h2><p>Endogenous progestogens are important regulators of vertebrate reproduction. Synthetic progestins are components of human contraceptive and hormone replacement pharmaceuticals. Both progestogens and progestins enter the environment through a number of sources, and have been shown to cause profound effects on reproductive health in various aquatic vertebrates. Progestins are designed to bind human progesterone receptors, but they also have been shown to strongly activate androgen receptors in fish.  (LNG) activates fish androgen receptors and induces development of male secondary sex characteristics in females of other species. Although behavior has been postulated to be a sensitive early indicator of exposure to certain environmental contaminants, no such research on the reproductive behavior of gestagen-exposed fish has been conducted to date. The goal of our study was to examine the exposure effects of a human contraceptive progestin, LNG, on the reproductive development and behavior of the viviparous eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). Internal fertilization is a requisite characteristic of viviparous species, and is enabled by an androgen driven elongation of the anal fin into the male gonopodium (i.e., phallus). In this study, we exposed adult mosquitofish to ethanol (EtOH control), 10ng/L, and 100ng/L LNG for 8d using a static replacement exposure design. After 8d, a subset of males and females from each treatment were examined for differences in the 4:6 anal fin ratio. In addition, paired social interaction trials were performed using individual control males and control females or females treated 10ng/L or 100ng/L LNG. Female mosquitofish exposed to LNG were masculinized as evidenced by the elongation of the anal fin rays, a feature normal to males and abnormal to females. LNG caused significant increases in the 4:6 anal fin ratios of female mosquitofish in both the 10ng/L and 100ng/L treatments, although these differences were not significant between the two treatments. LNG caused significant increases in the 4:6 anal fin ratio of males exposed to 100ng/L, with no effects observed in the 10ng/L treatment. In addition, the reproductive behavior of control males paired with female mosquitofish exposed to 100ng/L LNG was also altered, for these males spent more time exhibiting no reproductive behavior, had decreased attending behavior, and a lower number of gonopodial thrusts compared to control males paired to control female mosquitofish. Given the rapid effects on both anal fin morphology and behavior observed in this study, the mosquitofish is an excellent sentinel species for the detection of exposure to LNG and likely other 19-nortestosterone derived contraceptive progestins in the environment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Only a few studies explore the effect of progestogen treatment in a mixture as opposed to individual chemicals to shed light on how non-target species respond to these contaminants. In the present study, we used an invertebrate model species, Lymnaea stagnalis, exposed to a mixture of four progestogens (progesterone, , drospirenone, and gestodene) in 10ng/L concentration for 3 weeks. Data at both physiological and cellular/molecular level were analyzed using the ELISA technique, stereomicroscopy combined with time lapse software, and capillary microsampling combined with mass spectrometry. The treatment of adult Lymnaeas caused reduced egg production, and low quality egg mass on the first week, compared to the control. Starting from the second week, the egg production, and the quality of egg mass were similar in both groups. At the end of the third week, the egg production and the vitellogenin-like protein content of the hepatopancreas were significantly elevated in the treated group. At the cellular level, accelerated cell proliferation was observed during early embryogenesis in the treated group. The investigation of metabolomic changes resulted significantly elevated hexose utilization in the single-cell zygote cytoplasm, and elevated adenylate energy charge in the egg albumen. These changes suggested that treated snails provided more hexose in the eggs in order to improve offspring viability.

The progesterone receptor (PR) is one of the treatment targets in breast cancer, and can be blocked with selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs). Since administration of chemical drugs can cause serious side effects, and patients, especially those undergoing long-term treatment, can suffer harmful consequences, there is an urgent need to discover novel potent drugs. Large-scale structural diversity is a feature of natural compounds. Accordingly, in the present study, we selected a library of 20,000 natural compounds from the ZINC database, and screened them against the PR for binding affinity and efficacy. In addition, we evaluated the pharmacodynamics and ADMET properties of the compounds and performed molecular docking. Moreover, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried out in order to examine the stability of the protein. In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to study the motions of the protein. Finally, the MMPBSA method was applied in order to estimate the binding free . Our docking results reveal that compounds ZINC00936598, ZINC00869973 and ZINC01020370 have the highest binding  into the PR binding site, comparable with that of  (positive control). Moreover, RMSD, RMSF, Rg and H-bond analysis demonstrate that the lead compounds preserve stability in complex with PR during simulation. Our PCA analysis results were in accordance with MD results and the binding free energies support the docking results. This study paves the way for discovery of novel drugs from natural sources and with optimal efficacy, targeting the PR.

To explore a new approach to its management capable of preserving future fertility, the molecular pathology of ovarian endometrioma is reviewed and mechanisms by which the endometrioma progressively affects the ovary during reproductive life are summarized. The scope of new therapeutic modalities includes restoring the progesterone receptor ratio using progestin or progesterone receptor modulators and decreasing local oestrogen production through an aromatase inhibitor. In addition, free radical production can be blocked by antioxidants and the autophagic process by increasing apoptosis. Finally, metalloproteinases and relaxin activity, as well as the inflammatory process can be controlled. Many of these pharmacological treatments lend themselves to local administration and can be applied through intracystic drug administration; in fact, the intracystic route has already been tried with recombinant interleukin-2, methotrexate and ethanol; the latter to obtain sclerotization. Specifically, it is proposed that endometrial growth in the endometrioma is suppressed by intra-cystic application of synthetic progestins, such as  or danazol, selective progesterone receptor modulators, such as mifepristone, ulipristal or asoprisnil, without affecting ovarian activity.Copyright © 2016 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.

Contrasting effects of nicotine exposure on endothelial function have been reported. The effect of non-smoking nicotine exposure on endothelial dysfunction during COC treatment remains to be fully elucidated. We therefore, sought to determine the effects of nicotine exposure during COC treatment on endothelial dysfunction mediators and circulating corticosteroids. Female Wistar rats aged 10 weeks were given (po) vehicle, nicotine (1.0 mg/kg) with or without COC steroids (1.0 µg ethinylestradiol and 5.0 µg ) daily for 6 weeks. Nicotine exposure caused 113.3% increase in insulinemia whereas COC treatment led to 76.9% increased insulinemia compared with control. Furthermore, COC treatment or nicotine exposure led to glucose deregulation, insulin resistance, reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, uric acid, oxidative stress, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and corticosteroids. However, COC + NIC treatment led to 41.2% decrease in insulemina compared with COC-treated rats.

Therefore, urine usage implies the risk of transfer of pharmaceutical residues to agricultural fields and environment contamination. Thus, this study aimed on the development and validation of a LC-MS/MS method for D-norgestrel (D-NOR) and progesterone (PRO) determination in human urine, as well as the evaluation of the removal efficiency of two methods (storage and evaporation), and the effects of acidification with sulfuric acid. The storage process was evaluated for 6 weeks, while the evaporation was assessed at three different temperatures (50, 75, and 100 °C). All experiments were done with normal urine (pH = 6.0) and acidified urine (pH = 2.0, with sulfuric acid). The results of validation showed good method efficiency. In the second week of storage, higher hormone degradation was observed. In the evaporation method, both D-NOR and PRO were almost completely degraded when the volume was reduced to the lowermost level. Results also indicate that acidification did not affect degradation. Overall, the results showed that combination of two methods can be employed for more efficient hormone removal in urine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306173>A pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic evaluation of contraceptive implants and antiretroviral therapy among women in Kenya and Uganda.</a></h2><p>To evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of contraceptive implant progestin concentrations in HIV-positive women initiating efavirenz (EFV)-containing or nevirapine (NVP)-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART).We analyzed stored samples from women self-reporting implant use in the Partners PrEP Study.Plasma samples collected every 6 months were analyzed for  and etonogestrel concentrations. Progestin concentrations from samples collected after ART initiation were compared with pre-ART concentrations for intraindividual comparisons. We used adjusted linear mixed models to compare hormone concentrations between individuals on EFV and NVP to a no ART group. We then evaluated whether possessing certain alleles with known or possible influences on EFV, NVP, or progestin metabolism were associated with changes in progestin concentrations or modified the association between ART use and progestin concentrations.Our analysis included 11 women who initiated EFV, 13 who initiated NVP, and 36 who remained ART-naive. In the EFV group, the adjusted geometric mean ratio (aGMR) of  was 0.39 [90% confidence intervals (0.31, 0.49); P < 0.001] and the etonogestrel aGMR was 0.51 (0.34, 0.76; P = 0.006) compared with the control group. No difference was observed in the NVP group compared with controls [ 0.93 (0.74, 1.18); P = 0.64; etonogestrel 1.07 (0.77, 1.50); P = 0.73]. Possession of four allele variants were found to result in further reductions in progestin concentrations among those receiving EFV.Concomitant use of EFV significantly reduces  or etonogestrel concentrations by 61 and 49%, respectively, compared with no ART use. We also report allelic variants in hepatic enzymes that influenced the extent of the observed drug-interaction between progestins and EFV.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29490289>Maintaining physiologic testosterone levels during combined oral contraceptives by adding dehydroepiandrosterone: II. Effects on sexual function. A phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.</a></h2><p>The objective was to evaluate the effect of combined oral contraceptives (OCs) on sexual function, either alone or together with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).An exploratory randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative, crossover study was conducted in 81 OC users. Subjects discontinued their OC for one cycle before being randomized for 10cycles to a 30-mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE)/ (LNG) OC or a 30-mcg EE/drospirenone (DRSP) OC, along with daily use of 50mg dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or placebo during five OC cycles before crossing over from DHEA to placebo or the reverse for another fivecycles. First, the effect on sexual function of five OC cycles + placebo was compared to baseline. Then, the effect of five OC cycles + DHEA was compared to the OC+placebo. Results regarding endocrine changes have been published separately. Primary efficacy outcomes of the current study were genital response (measured by vaginal pulse amplitude [VPA]) and sexual feelings (measured by the subjective self-assessment questionnaire [SSAQ]) to self-induced erotic fantasy and visual sexual stimuli in a laboratory setting and measures of desire and arousability using a sexual function diary (SFD). Secondary efficacy outcomes were the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Female Sexual Distress Scale Revised.Eighty-one women were enrolled, and 74 women completed the study. Five cycles of OC+placebo resulted in a significant decline compared to baseline of four out of six SFD self-ratings of sexual desire and arousability with both OCs. The LNG OC also resulted in significant declines in the FSFI scores (baseline vs. LNG OC+placebo: total score, 28.7±3.7 vs. 25.6±7.4; arousal, 5.0±0.7 vs. 4.5±1.4; lubrication, 5.2±0.9 vs. 4.6±1.7; pain, 4.9±0.9 vs. 4.5±1.4), but no changes were observed using the DRSP OC. In the laboratory setting, five cycles of OC+DHEA showed no significant differences with placebo except for a significant increase in genital sensations (SSAQ) during erotic fantasy (OC+placebo vs. OC+DHEA: 3.3±1.4 vs. 3.6±1.5; p<.05). No significant changes were observed for genital response (VPA) and the other two variables of the SSAQ assessed after visual erotic stimulus exposure. Using the SFD, 5 out of 10 variables showed a significant improvement with DHEA. Partner's initiative was rejected less often with OC+DHEA compared to placebo (OC+placebo vs. OC+DHEA: 1.1±1.5 vs. 0.8±1.0; p<.05). Women with free testosterone levels in the upper quartile during DHEA co-administration showed significantly better effects on sexual arousal and desire compared to the three lower quartiles (lower vs. upper quartiles: sexual arousability: 25.0±19.8 vs. 41.2±29.0; sexual desire: 5.6±3.7 vs. 9.6±8.0; desire for sex with partner: 4.9±3.1 vs. 8.6±7.4; number of sex fantasies: 3.0±3.2 vs. 5.5±4.4; all p<.05).In this exploratory study, OC use was associated with decreases in some measures of sexual functioning, whereas others remained unchanged. Maintaining or restoring physiological testosterone concentrations by the co-administration of DHEA to the OC may prevent these effects on sexuality, particularly in women with relatively high but physiologic levels of free testosterone during DHEA co-administration.The results of this exploratory study warrant further testing of the hypothesis that restoration and/or preservation of physiologic testosterone levels during OC use by co-administration of DHEA has favorable effects on those aspects of sexual function compromised by OCs.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Although observational studies identify DMPA as an important STI risk factor, mechanisms underlying this connection are undefined.  (LNG) is another progestin used for hormonal contraception, but its effect on STI susceptibility is much less explored. Using a mouse model of genital herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection, we herein found that DMPA and LNG similarly reduced genital expression of the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein-1α (DSG1α), enhanced access of inflammatory cells to genital tissue by increasing mucosal epithelial permeability, and increased susceptibility to viral infection. Additional studies with uninfected mice revealed that DMPA-mediated increases in mucosal permeability promoted tissue inflammation by facilitating endogenous vaginal microbiota invasion. Conversely, concomitant treatment of mice with DMPA and intravaginal estrogen restored mucosal barrier function and prevented HSV-2 infection. Evaluating ectocervical biopsy tissue from women before and 1 month after initiating DMPA remarkably revealed that inflammation and barrier protection were altered by treatment identically to changes seen in progestin-treated mice. Together, our work reveals DMPA and LNG diminish the genital mucosal barrier; a first-line defense against all STI, but may offer foundation for new contraceptive strategies less compromising of barrier protection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27841046>Targeting mast cells: a new way to treat endometriosis.</a></h2><p>Endometriosis is a chronic estrogen-dependent inflammatory disease of unclear etiology that affects 15-20% of women of reproductive age. Efforts are now focusing on understanding new mechanisms involved in its physiopathology, like novel target  and different molecules. There is evidence that mast cells (MCs) play a role in this disease. This article summarizes recent achievements in preclinical studies and clinical activities investigating the role of MCs in endometriosis. Targeting MCs might offer new alternatives to treat this disease. Areas covered: A systematic literature search was performed (PubMed, Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov) using the keywords 'endometriosis and mast cells'. All relevant articles (34) found in PubMed were examined and their reference lists reviewed in order to pinpoint further studies for potential inclusion. Expert opinion: Since endometriosis is a multifactorial disease, and considering that numbers of MCs and activated MCs were clearly increased in endometriotic lesions in both animals and humans, use of MC stabilizers and inhibitors may prove to be effective to treat endometriosis and its associated pain. However, more data from preclinical studies and clinical trials will help to better define the status of MCs in the treatment of this pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27475034>Perspectives on variability in pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive product.</a></h2><p>The early literature and reviews have described the pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral contraceptive (OC) compounds such as ethinyl estradiol (EE) and  (LNG) in women as subject to large intersubject variability. This was partly due to the use of diverse radioimmunoassays, limited sampling periods and an incomplete understanding of single- vs. multiple-dose kinetics and the role of EE in causing both inhibition of hepatic  along with induction of sex hormone binding globulin. Over the past two decades, LNG and EE have been used as target drugs for the assessment of possible drug interactions upon introduction of many new therapeutic agents. This has resulted in at least 17 publications that describe the PK of LNG and EE in women using various 150 mcg/30 mcg products under fairly standard multiple-dose conditions. A review of these studies indicates only moderate variability in the C and area under the curve both within and across these studies. There is impressive similarity in these drug exposure indices found in studies carried out with several products by investigators at numerous sites and countries.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This study evaluated the folic acid supplementation after oral administration of the ethinyl estradiol 0.02 mg +  0.10 mg + folic acid 0.4 mg coated tablet as well as its safety and tolerability in healthy female subjects.36 healthy female subjects received 1 coated tablet of the test product - ethinyl estradiol 0.02 mg +  0.10 mg + folic acid 0.4 mg for 21 days and a placebo coated tablet containing folic acid 0.4 mg only on the last 7 days of the cycle, in 3 cycles. Blood samples were collected to quantify folate by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The safety was assessed by recording adverse events, monitoring of vital signs, and the evaluation of laboratory tests and ECG.The mean whole blood level of folic acid at baseline (1 day of 1 cycle) was 42.7 ± 22.2 ng/mL, while on the 28 day of the 3 cycle it was 47.6 ± 20.1 ng/mL, with a variation of 11.32%.

Estrogen-progestin therapy has been used as exogenous estrogen to normalize depressed estrogen level during menopause. Ovariectomized rodents mimic an estrogen-deficient state in that they develop cardiometabolic dysfunction, including insulin resistance (IR). We therefore hypothesized that hormonal therapy with combined oral contraceptive steroids, ethinylestradiol- (EEL), improves IR, obesity, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) through reduction of circulating mineralocorticoid in ovariectomized rats. Twelve-week-old female Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups: sham-operated (SHM) and ovariectomized (OVX) rats were treated with or without EEL (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol and 5.0 μg ) daily for 8 weeks. Results showed that OVX or SHM + EEL treated rats had increased HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment of IR), 1 h postload glucose, HOMA-β, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), TC/HDL cholesterol, TG/HDL cholesterol, plasma insulin, GSK-3, corticosterone, and aldosterone. On the other hand, OVX + EEL treatment ameliorated all these effects except that of aldosterone. Taken together, the results demonstrate that oral hormonal replacement with EEL improves IR and pancreatic β-cell function and suppresses GSK-3 and glucocorticoid independent of circulating aldosterone, suggesting a positive cardiometabolic effect of oral EEL therapy in estrogen-deficient rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308416>Oral contraceptive use increases risk of inflammatory and coagulatory disorders in women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome: An observational study.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a multispectral disorder requiring lifelong management. Its pathophysiology is still being explored which makes its treatment options restrained. Present study explores impact of oral contraceptive mode of treatment on metabolic, hormonal,  and coagulation profile of PCOS women. 50 subjects diagnosed with Rotterdam criteria receiving no drug treatment served as controls whereas 50 subjects receiving only OCPs (Ethinyl estradiol 0.03 mg,  0.15 mg) as a mode of treatment at least for six-months served as cases. Ferriman-Gallwey score and hormonal profile improved on OCP treatment. However, parameters like weight, Body mass index, waist-hip ratio, Oral glucose tolerance test, lipid profile, insulin, HOMA-IR, adiponectin, interleukin1β, visfatin, resistin, tissue factor, PT and APTT showed considerable derangements in OCP group. All above parameters are associated with the risk of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, coronary vascular disease, cancers, hypercoagulable state, venous thromboembolism and thrombotic events. Long-term use of OCPs needs to be considered carefully for PCOS patients who are already burdened with associated risk factors. This study was conducted in a region where women do not have much access to high-end screening and diagnostic facilities that further exacerbates their clinical outcomes. Large scale, long-term studies need to be designed to further evaluate safety use of OCPs in PCOS women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30120779>Quantitative determination of  in beagle dog plasma after vaginal administration of intravaginal ring by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>A specific and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method that could be used to determine the concentration of  (LNG) in beagle dog plasma was developed. Specifically, terfenadine was used as the internal standard (IS). The separation was achieved on a Kinetex-C 110A column (3 × 30 mm i.d., 2.6 um, Phenomenex) and a gradient mobile phase consists of methanol (0.1% formic acid) and water (0.1% formic acid) was used. The flow rate was 0.8 mL/min and the injection volume was 10 μL. The detection was performed on a triple-quadruple tandem mass spectrometer by multiple reaction monitoring mode via electrospray ionization. Quantitative analysis was carried out at m/z 313.0 → 108.9 and m/z 472.6 → 436.2 for LNG and IS respectively. This method demonstrated the linearity of LNG over a concentration range of 0.5-50 ng/mL with a coefficient correlation (r) of 0.9973. The lower limit of quantification was 0.5 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-assay precisions were 2.9 and 11.2%, with an accuracy range from 94.8 to 108.4%. The stability data indicated that sample preparation and storage process had little effect on the concentration of LNG QC sample. The validated method was successfully applied to study the pharmacokinetics of LNG in beagle dog after vaginal administration of intravaginal ring.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27567593>Progestin-only contraceptives: effects on weight.</a></h2><p>Progestin-only contraceptives (POCs) are appropriate for many women who cannot or should not take estrogen. POCs include injectables, intrauterine contraception, implants, and oral contraceptives. Many POCs are long-acting, cost-effective methods of preventing pregnancy. However, concern about weight gain can deter the initiation of contraceptives and cause early discontinuation among users.The primary objective was to evaluate the association between progestin-only contraceptive use and changes in body weight.Until 4 August 2016, we searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, POPLINE, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. For the initial review, we contacted investigators to identify other trials.We considered comparative studies that examined a POC versus another contraceptive method or no contraceptive. The primary outcome was mean change in body weight or mean change in body composition. We also considered the dichotomous outcome of loss or gain of a specified amount of weight.Two authors extracted the data. Non-randomized studies (NRS) need to control for confounding factors. We used adjusted measures for the primary effects in NRS or the results of matched analysis from paired samples. If the report did not provide adjusted measures for the primary analysis, we used unadjusted outcomes. For RCTs and NRS without adjusted measures, we computed the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous variables. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI.We found 22 eligible studies that included a total of 11,450 women. With 6 NRS added to this update, the review includes 17 NRS and 5 RCTs. By contraceptive method, the review has 16 studies of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), 4 of -releasing intrauterine contraception (LNG-IUC), 5 for implants, and 2 for progestin-only pills.Comparison groups did not differ significantly for weight change or other body composition measure in 15 studies. Five studies with moderate or low quality evidence showed differences between study arms. Two studies of a six-rod implant also indicated some differences, but the evidence was low quality.Three studies showed differences for DMPA users compared with women not using a hormonal method. In a retrospective study, weight gain (kg) was greater for DMPA versus copper (Cu) IUC in years one (MD 2.28, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.77), two (MD 2.71, 95% CI 2.12 to 3.30), and three (MD 3.17, 95% CI 2.51 to 3.83). A prospective study showed adolescents using DMPA had a greater increase in body fat (%) compared with a group not using a hormonal method (MD 11.00, 95% CI 2.64 to 19.36). The DMPA group also had a greater decrease in lean body mass (%) (MD -4.00, 95% CI -6.93 to -1.07). A more recent retrospective study reported greater mean increases with use of DMPA versus Cu IUC for weight (kg) at years 1 (1.3 vs 0.2), 4 (3.5 vs 1.9), and 10 (6.6 vs 4.9).Two studies reported a greater mean increase in body fat mass (%) for POC users versus women not using a hormonal method. The method was LNG-IUC in two studies (reported means 2.5 versus -1.3; P = 0.029); (MD 1.60, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.75). One also studied a desogestrel-containing pill (MD 3.30, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.52). Both studies showed a greater decrease in lean body mass among POC users.We considered the overall quality of evidence to be low; more than half of the studies had low quality evidence. The main reasons for downgrading were lack of randomizations (NRS) and high loss to follow-up or early discontinuation.These 22 studies showed limited evidence of change in weight or body composition with use of POCs. Mean weight gain at 6 or 12 months was less than 2 kg (4.4 lb) for most studies. Those with multiyear data showed mean weight change was approximately twice as much at two to four years than at one year, but generally the study groups did not differ significantly. Appropriate counseling about typical weight gain may help reduce discontinuation of contraceptives due to perceptions of weight gain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27390369>Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of an intravaginal ring releasing anastrozole and  in healthy premenopausal women: a Phase 1 randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>What are suitable doses of the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole (ATZ) and the progestin  (LNG), when delivered to the systemic circulation by an intravaginal ring (IVR), for further clinical development as a potential new therapy for the treatment of endometriosis?Anticipated targets for pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety/tolerability were achieved for both drug components of the IVR at the doses investigated, supporting selection of the doses to be investigated in Phase 2 studies.Aromatase is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of estrogens and is known to increase local levels of estradiol (E2) at extragonadal sites. Up-regulation of aromatase expression has been demonstrated in endometriotic lesions and the use of oral aromatase inhibitors has been shown to reduce endometriosis-associated pelvic pain in small-scale clinical trials.This Phase 1, randomized, multicentre, parallel-group, three-arm, open-label study assessed the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of various IVRs intended for systemic drug delivery. After screening, healthy, ovulating women aged 18-35 years were randomized to use IVRs releasing one of the three ATZ/LNG dose combinations (in vitro nominal daily drug release rates on Day 29: ATZ/LNG 500 µg/20 µg [low dose], ATZ/LNG 1000 µg/30 µg [mid dose] or ATZ/LNG 1500 µg/40 µg [high dose]) for two consecutive 28-day wearing periods without a treatment break.Sixty women were included in the per protocol set. The primary variables were plasma concentrations of ATZ and LNG at the end of each treatment period and the mean size of largest follicle-like structures (FLSs) over 56 days. Serum concentrations of several hormones were also evaluated, with emphasis on E2 levels.At the end of the first treatment period, geometric mean plasma concentrations of LNG and ATZ, respectively, were 0.228 and 12.5 µg/l for the low dose, 0.269 and 19.8 µg/l for the mid dose and 0.384 and 37.3 µg/l for the high dose; results were similar at the end of the second treatment period. Over the entire treatment period, mean FLS sizes were higher in all three treatment groups than during the pretreatment cycle; more women in the mid- and high-dose groups had FLSs of at least 30 mm (32-45%) than those in the low-dose group (14-24%). Changes in the mean size of FLSs were similar to those reported for low-dose progestin-only oral contraceptives and generally resolved during the 2-month treatment period. Serum E2 levels were decreased, but only one woman in each of the mid- and high-dose groups, and no woman in the low-dose group, had a serum E2 level below 20 pg/ml in both cycles. All ATZ and LNG combinations showed good tolerability.This was an exploratory study; no formal power calculation was performed.The results of this first-in-human study of the ATZ/LNG IVR facilitated the selection of ATZ and LNG doses to be investigated in the Phase 2 studies of patients with endometriosis.The study was funded by Bayer Pharma AG.

Claudin-11 knockout mice are infertile; additionally claudin-11 is spatially disrupted in chronically gonadotropin-suppressed rats coincident with a loss of BTB function, and claudin-11 is disorganized in various human testicular disorders. These data support the Sertoli cell TJ as a potential site of hormonal contraceptive action.BTB proteins were assessed by immunohistochemistry (n = 16 samples) and mRNA (n = 18 samples) expression levels in available archived testis tissue from a previous study of 22 men who had undergone 8 weeks of gonadotropin suppression and for whom meiotic and post-meiotic germ cell numbers were available. The gonadotropin suppression regimens were (i) testosterone enanthate (TE) plus the GnRH antagonist, acyline (A); (ii) TE + the progestin, , (LNG); (iii) TE + LNG + A or (iv) TE + LNG + the 5α-reductase inhibitor, dutasteride (D). A control group consisted of seven additional men, with three archived samples available for this study.Immunohistochemical localization of claudin-11 (TJ) and other junctional type markers [ZO-1 (cytoplasmic plaque), β-catenin (adherens junction), connexin-43 (gap junction), vinculin (ectoplasmic specialization) and β-actin (cytoskeleton)] and quantitative PCR was conducted using matched frozen testis tissue.Claudin-11 formed a continuous staining pattern at the BTB in control men. Regardless of gonadotropin suppression treatment, claudin-11 localization was markedly disrupted and was broadly associated with the extent of meiotic/post-meiotic germ cell suppression; claudin-11 staining was (i) punctate (i.e. 'spotty' appearance) at the basal aspect of tubules when the average numbers of adluminal germ cells were <15% of control, (ii) presented as short fragments with cytoplasmic extensions when numbers were 15-25% of control or (iii) remained continuous when numbers were >40% of control. Changes in localization of connexin-43 and vinculin were also observed (smaller effects than for claudin-11) but ZO-1, β-catenin and β-actin did not differ, compared with control.Claudin-11 was the only Sertoli cell TJ protein investigated, but it is considered to be the most pivotal of constituent proteins given its known implication in infertility and BTB function. We were limited to testis samples which had been gonadotropin-suppressed for 8 weeks, shorter than the 74-day spermatogenic wave, which may account for the heterogeneity in claudin-11 and germ cell response observed among the men. Longer suppression (12-24 weeks) is known to suppress germ cells further and claudin-11 disruption may be more uniform, although we could not access such samples.These findings are important for our understanding of the sites of action of male hormonal contraception, because they suggest that BTB function could be ablated following long-term hormone suppression treatment.National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia) Program Grants 241000 and 494802; Research Fellowship 1022327 (to R.I.M.) and the Victorian Government's Operational Infrastructure Support Program.

Because elevated endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) has been found in several studies to be a VTE risk factor, we evaluated the extent of ETP changes during the initial cycle of an ethinyl estradiol (EE) and  (LNG) COC. We also assessed the relationship between ETP changes and systemic EE and LNG concentrations.Participants provided multiple blood samples during a first 21-day cycle of a 30-mcg EE/150-mcg LNG COC and after a further 7 days without an active COC. Thrombin generation measured with and without addition of activated protein C (APC) yielded ETP and ETP and the normalized APC sensitivity ratio (nAPCsr). EE and LNG pharmacokinetic analyses were conducted over 24 h after the first COC tablet and again at steady state.Thrombin generation was determined in 16 of the 17 women who completed the study. Mean ETP increased steadily to 21% above baseline at 24 h after the 6th COC tablet (COC6; p<.001) and to 28% above baseline at steady state (COC21; p<.001). The percentage increase in mean ETP was considerably more - 54% at COC6 and 79% at steady state. Mean nAPCsr increased by 28% at COC6 and by 41% at steady state. Higher concentrations of EE or LNG were not correlated with greater increases in ETP.ETP increases during the first COC cycle were substantial.The early increases in ETP may provide biological support for the rapid increase in VTE risk during initial COC use. The lack of association between this clotting system perturbation and the systemic EE concentration is surprising and deserves further study.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we studied the effects of both the menstrual cycle and oral contraceptives (OCs) on amygdala and salience network resting-state functional connectivity using a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled design. Hormone levels, depressive symptoms, and resting-state functional connectivity were measured in 35 healthy women (24.9±4.2 years) who had previously experienced OC-related negative affect. All participants were examined in the follicular phase of a baseline cycle and in the third week of the subsequent cycle during treatment with either a combined OC (30 μg ethinyl estradiol/0.15 mg ) or placebo. The latter time point targeted the midluteal phase in placebo users and steady-state ethinyl estradiol and  concentrations in OC users. Amygdala and salience network connectivity generally increased with both higher endogenous and synthetic hormone levels, although amygdala-parietal cortical connectivity decreased in OC users.

This study was aimed to describe the pharmacokinetic characteristics of this new combination contraceptive tablet in female Chinese volunteers.This study was designed as phase I, open-label, and one-sequence clinical trial. 12 healthy nonpregnant female Chinese volunteers received a single dose (1 tablet) and multiple dose (1 tablet per day) administration for 21 consecutive days under fasting condition. Blood samples were analyzed with 2 validated LC-MS/MS methods for EE and LNG, respectively.After the single dose administration, the C max of EE and LNG were 44.76±18.64 pg/mL and 2.256±1.008 ng/mL, respectively. The steady-state condition of EE was achieved on the 6(th) day after the beginning of the multiple dose administration, while the steady-state condition of LNG was achieved on the 21(st) day. For EE, the mean MRT 0-72 and t 1/2 increased by 40.2 and 30.6%, meanwhile the mean Cl/F and Vd/F decreased by 18.5 and 29.1%, respectively from Day 1 to Day 24. For LNG, the mean MRT 0-72 increased by 27.1%, while the mean Cl/F and Vd/F decreased by 62.4 and 86.3%, respectively from Day 1 to Day 24. The t 1/2 remained unchanged for LNG. The exposure of LNG significantly increased with repeated dosing, but that of EE just slightly increased.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26551686>From single chemicals to mixtures--reproductive effects of  and ethinylestradiol on the fathead minnow.</a></h2><p>The aquatic environment is polluted with thousands of chemicals. It is currently unclear which of these pose a significant threat to aquatic biota. The typical exposure scenario is now represented by a widespread blanket of contamination composed of myriads of individual pollutants-each typically present at a low concentration. The synthetic steroids, 17α-ethinylestradiol and , have been widely reported to be present in the aquatic environment in the low ng to sub-ng/l range. They are widely used in contraceptive formulations, both individually and in combination. Our research employed the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) 21 day 'pair-breeding' assay to assess reproductive output when pairs of fish were exposed to the single chemicals at low environmentally relevant concentrations, and then to a binary mixture of them. A variety of endpoints were assessed, including egg production, which was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by both the individual chemicals and the mixture. Significant, sex specific effects were also seen with both chemicals, at differing levels of biological organisation. Plasma concentrations of EE2 and  were predicted and in the case of  measured, and compared with the human therapeutic plasma concentrations (Read-Across approach) to support the interpretation of the results. A novel quantitative method was developed for the data analysis, which ensured a suitable endpoint for the comparative mixture assessment. This approach compares the reproductive performance from individual pairs of fish during chemical exposure to its pre-treatment performance. The responses from the empirical mixture study were compared to predictions derived from the single substance data. We hypothesised combined responses which were best described by the concept of concentration addition, and found no clear indications against this additivity expectation. However, the effect profiles support the current knowledge that both compounds act in different ways to reduce egg production in fish, and suggest that probably response addition (also called Independent action) is the more appropriate mixture model in this case.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

Overweight women of mean age 33.9 ± 6.7 years and mean BMI (body mass index) of 36.5 ± 7.0 kg/m with PCOS ( = 60) were randomized to either metformin, higher-dose oral contraceptive pill (OCP) or low-dose OCP + spironolactone (OCP + S). Primary outcome measures included changes in plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (PF1 and 2), plasminogen, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) and thrombin generation (TG).  PAI-1 activity fell in all groups, ADMA fell in higher-dose OCP, PF1 and 2 increased with metformin and higher-dose OCP, TG rose and tPA fell in both OCP groups, plasminogen increased in all and TAFI increased after higher-dose OCP.  Endothelial function (primary haemostasis) improved with higher dose with some improvement in low-dose OCP + S and metformin. Aberrant coagulation was noted in both OCP groups, but not with metformin. Fibrinolysis was reduced with higher-dose OCP. Our work suggests an additional dimension of treatment (haemostatic system effects) that favours metformin treatment over the OCP in PCOS.Schattauer GmbH Stuttgart.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27475035> butanoate intramuscular injection does not reliably suppress ovulation for 90 days in obese and normal-BMI women: a pilot study.</a></h2><p>We performed a pilot evaluation of a new formulation of  butanoate (LB) designed to be a long-acting injectable (6 months) contraceptive to determine pharmacodynamic end points in normal-body mass index (BMI) and obese women.Obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m) and normal-BMI, otherwise healthy, women received a single intramuscular injection of LB after ovulation was confirmed in a baseline cycle.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of subcutaneous etonogestrel implantation on adenomyosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS A clinical observational study included 17 women with adenomyosis who were treated with subcutaneous etonogestrel implants and followed-up for 12 months. Imaging and clinical observations were undertaken in the 17 patients at baseline (time 0), and at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months following subcutaneous etonogestrel implantation. The following imaging and clinical findings were compared between baseline (time 0) and 12-month follow-up: menstrual bleeding pattern, dysmenorrhea, visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, uterine volume, serum cancer antigen 125 (CA125) levels, hemoglobin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, luteinizing hormone levels, serum estradiol levels, and any treatment side effects. RESULTS All 17 patients treated with etonogestrel implants completed the 12-month follow-up, at which time, the mean hemoglobin level (127.08±2.56 g/L) was significantly higher compared with that at baseline (94.54±5.47 g/L; P<0.01); uterine volume, serum CA125, and VAS score for dysmenorrhea at 12 months (118.03±12.83 cm³, 34.58±9.66 U/mL, and 1.45±0.35, respectively) were significantly lower when compared with baseline (198.53±39.47 cm³, 100.41±49.89 U/mL, and 7.62±0.74, respectively) (P<0.01, for all). However, changes in bleeding pattern and amenorrhoea occurred after treatment in some women. CONCLUSIONS Subcutaneous etonogestrel was effective in reducing some symptoms and signs of adenomyosis, including dysmenorrhea, anemia, serum CA125, and uterine volume.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27245768>Several synthetic progestins disrupt the glial cell specific-brain aromatase expression in developing zebra fish.</a></h2><p>The effects of some progestins on fish reproduction have been recently reported revealing the hazard of this class of steroidal pharmaceuticals. However, their effects at the central nervous system level have been poorly studied until now. Notwithstanding, progesterone, although still widely considered primarily a sex hormone, is an important agent affecting many central nervous system functions. Herein, we investigated the effects of a large set of synthetic ligands of the nuclear progesterone receptor on the glial-specific expression of the zebrafish brain aromatase (cyp19a1b) using zebrafish mechanism-based assays. Progesterone and 24 progestins were first screened on transgenic cyp19a1b-GFP zebrafish embryos. We showed that progesterone, dydrogesterone, drospirenone and all the progesterone-derived progestins had no effect on GFP expression. Conversely, all progestins derived from 19-nortesterone induced GFP in a concentration-dependent manner with EC50 ranging from the low nM range to hundreds nM. The 19-nortestosterone derived progestins  (LNG) and norethindrone (NET) were further tested in a radial glial cell context using U251-MG cells co-transfected with zebrafish ER subtypes (zfERα, zfERβ1 or zfERβ2) and cyp19a1b promoter linked to luciferase. Progesterone had no effect on luciferase activity while NET and LNG induced luciferase activity that was blocked by ICI 182,780. Zebrafish-ERs competition assays showed that NET and LNG were unable to bind to ERs, suggesting that the effects of these compounds on cyp19a1b require  activation prior to elicit estrogenic activity. Overall, we demonstrate that 19-nortestosterone derived progestins elicit estrogenic activity by inducing cyp19a1b expression in radial glial cells. Given the crucial role of radial glial cells and neuro-estrogens in early development of brain, the consequences of exposure of fish to these compounds require further investigation.Copyright © 2016.

These studies evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetic interactions between elbasvir (EBR) and grazoprevir (GZR) and ethinyl estradiol/ (EE/LNG).Both studies were open-label, single-site, two-period, fixed-sequence, one-way interaction studies. In period 1, subjects received one tablet of EE/LNG (0.03 mg/0.15 mg). In period 2, subjects received EBR (50 mg once daily) for 13 days or GZR (200 mg once daily) for 10 days, with one tablet of EE/LNG on day 7 (GZR group) or 10 (EBR group). Each study enrolled 20 healthy, nonsmoking adult females.There was no clinically meaningful effect of multiple doses of EBR or GZR on the pharmacokinetics of EE or LNG. Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) for AUC and C in the presence and absence of EBR were 1.01 and 1.10 for EE and 1.14 and 1.02 for LNG, with 90% confidence intervals (CIs) that were contained in the interval [0.80, 1.25]. Similarly, the AUC and C GMRs in the presence and absence of GZR were 1.10 and 1.05 for EE and 1.23 and 0.93 for LNG, respectively. The 90% CIs for EE AUC and for EE and LNG C were contained in the interval [0.80, 1.25]; however, the 90% CI for the LNG AUC [1.15, 1.32] slightly exceeded the upper bound.These results suggest that EBR/GZR can be co-administered to female patients with HCV of childbearing potential who are on OCPs to prevent pregnancy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25528415>Effect of body weight and BMI on the efficacy of  emergency contraception.</a></h2><p>To further evaluate the effect of weight and body mass index (BMI) on the efficacy of  emergency contraception.Data from two large, multicenter, randomized controlled trials designed to assess emergency contraceptive efficacy were pooled to evaluate the effect of weight and BMI on pregnancy rates among women who received . Descriptive methods (comparison of means and distributions according to pregnancy status and pregnancy rates across weight and BMI categories) as well as cubic spline modeling were used to describe the relationship between pregnancy risk and weight/BMI.The analysis population comprised 1731 women, among whom 38 pregnancies were reported. Women for whom  was not effective in preventing pregnancy had a significantly higher mean body weight and BMI than women who did not become pregnant (76.7 vs. 66.4 kg, p<.0001; 28.1 vs. 24.6 kg/m², p<.0001). The estimated pregnancy rate increased significantly from 1.4% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.5%-3.0%] among the group of women weighing 65-75 kg to 6.4% (95% CI: 3.1%-11.5%) and 5.7% (95% CI: 2.9%-10.0%) in the 75-85 kg and >85 kg groups, respectively. Statistical modeling demonstrated a steep increase in pregnancy risk starting from a weight near 70-75 kg to reach a risk of pregnancy of 6% or greater around 80 kg. Similar results were obtained for statistical modeling of BMI as well as when the two studies were analyzed individually.All analyses showed a significant drop in the efficacy of  emergency contraception with increasing body weight, with pregnancy risk in the higher weight categories similar to expected rates in the absence of contraception. Like body weight, increasing BMI was highly correlated with increased pregnancy risk.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We compared estimated in vivo  (LNG) release rates derived from Sino-implant (II) explants with similar data from removed Jadelle.We measured LNG remaining in 44 sets of Sino-implant (II) used for up to 7 years and removed in four Chinese clinics. Results were compared with published data for Jadelle explants used for up to 36 months. We estimated and compared monthly and daily LNG release rates for the two products using prediction models for drug release. We also estimated the dissolution profile similarity factor, f2, for LNG release.Both Sino-implant (II) and Jadelle release approximately 30% of total LNG load after 3 years. Results of fitting the data to a biologically plausible modified Higuchi prediction model indicate comparable release through 3 years. An estimated similarity factor of 80.6 (90% confidence interval: 70.8-85.7) indicates similarity in the dissolution profiles of the two implants.LNG release in vivo measured through explant analysis suggest that Sino-implant (II) and Jadelle may perform similarly through 3 years of use and could remain highly effective beyond this time point. These results align with published data for Jadelle and Sino-implant (II) showing high effectiveness for 5 years. Ongoing clinical studies comparing the products over 5 years present an opportunity to verify this supportive measure of clinical effectiveness.This innovative approach provides evidence that Sino-implant (II) may perform clinically similarly to Jadelle over 3 years and remain a highly effective contraceptive beyond this time point. Data from explant analyses show promise for investigating the equivalence of elusion profiles of contraceptive implants.Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, limited information is available about contraceptive safety for women with obesity since obesity is an exclusion criterion of most contraceptive clinical trials. As such little is known about the possible risks of HC exposure for women with obesity without comorbidities. One way to assess possible long-term risks in this population, even prior to the development of any clinical disease, is to measure alterations in subclinical atherosclerosis markers. We evaluated the effects of the -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) on subclinical markers of cardiovascular risk in women with obesity. This is a randomised clinical trial in which 106 women with obesity [body mass index (BMI)≥30kg/m] were randomised to the LNG-IUS (n=53) or to non-hormonal methods (n=53) and followed for 12 months. We evaluated waist circumference (WC), blood pressure, blood glucose, insulin, lipid profile, and endothelial function markers (carotid intima-media thickness, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, and carotid arterial stiffness). At 12 months, BMI (p=0.005), WC (p=0.045), and glucose levels (p=0.015) were significantly lower in the LNG-IUS group than in the control group.

In our earlier xenograft animal experiments, progesterone did not stimulate breast tumors. The aim of this study was to test dydrogesterone for the first time. The study also evaluated the effects of PGRMC1 on proliferation with progestogens. METHODS (1): In-vitro study. The proliferative effects of dydrogesterone and of progesterone were assessed in vitro using T47D cells transfected with PGRMC1 or empty vector in the presence or absence of estradiol. Additionally, to find the strongest proliferator for inclusion as a comparator in the xenograft animal study, norethisterone, , desogestrel, dienogest, drospirenone, nomegestrol, and cyproterone acetate were tested. METHODS (2): Xenograft main study. PGRMC1-transfected or empty-vector T47D and MCF7 xenotransplants were each treated with four different hormonal preparations: E2+placebo; E2+dydrogesterone; E2+progesterone; E2+norethisterone. A total of 112 castrated mice were randomly allocated to the 16 groups. This was thus a prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled four-arm study (45-50 days) with the two T47D and two MCF7 xenografts. Tumor volumes were monitored twice weekly. RESULTS (1): In-vitro study. The strongest proliferation was with norethisterone, but only with PGRMC1-transfected cells. There was significant proliferation with dydrogesterone, but not with progesterone in the absence of estradiol. However, no increase in proliferation was achieved by adding dydrogesterone to estradiol compared with the proliferation induced with estradiol alone, in contrast to norethisterone. RESULTS (2): Xenograft main study. There was significantly faster tumor growth with norethisterone + E2 than with E2+placebo in T47D and MCF7 PGRMC1 xenografts, but not with dydrogesterone + E2 or progesterone + E2. There was less tumor growth in empty-vector xenografts, without between-group differences.PGRMC1 increases the breast-cell proliferation effects of certain progestogens, including dydrogesterone, in contrast to progesterone, but not during estradiol-induced proliferation, either in vitro or in a xenograft animal model, in contrast to norethisterone. Thus the proliferative potency of dydrogesterone may be similar to that of progesterone. Clinical studies in women overexpressing PGRMC1 are recommended.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

GJIC change and further total Cx43 and serine 368 and 255 phosphorylated Cx43 were measured.5 × 10(-5) mol/L LNG revealed a time-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation and an increase of apoptosis in both HESCs and HEGCs. Furthermore, these cells demonstrated a significant GJIC enhancement upon treatment with 5 × 10(-5) mol/L for 48 hours. The effects of LNG were most noticeable in HESCs rather than in HEGCs. Associated with these changes, LNG induced a relative increase in total Cx43 in a time-dependent manner but not Ser368 phosphorylated Cx43. Moreover, laser scanning confocal microscope confirmed the increased expression of total Cx43 in the cytoplasm and, interestingly, the nuclear translocation of Ser255 phosphorylated Cx43.LNG likely inhibits the proliferation and promotes apoptosis in HESCs and HEGCs though an increase in gap junction permeability in vitro, which is achieved through the upregulation of Cx43 expression and the translocation of serine 255 phosphorylated Cx43 from the plasma to the nuclear compartment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25582984>Self-reported and verified compliance in a phase 3 clinical trial of a novel low-dose contraceptive patch and pill.</a></h2><p>Pregnancy rates in US contraceptive clinical trials are increasing due to decreased treatment compliance.

In this study, we aimed to investigate how different isoforms of progestin in COCs affect the risk of VTE by measuring PS expression.The effect of progestin,  (LNG) or drospirenone (DRSP), on PS mRNA expression in HepG2 cells was measured using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; PS level was determined using Western blot analysis. PROS1 promoter activity, PS mRNA stability, and de novo synthesis of PS mRNA were examined in HepG2 cells after treatment with progestin.In the presence of progestins, PS mRNA and protein expressions were significantly upregulated in HepG2 cells due to the augmentation of de novo PS mRNA expression modulated by RNA polymerase II (Pol II), thereby facilitating PS transcription elongation. Moreover, the transcription elongation inhibitor blocked progestin-mediated de novo PS mRNA expression. Conversely, progestin did not affect PROS1 promoter activity and PS mRNA stability. Pol II elongation efficiency in the newer-generation progestin (DRSP) treatment was not as strong compared with older-generation progestin (LNG), suggesting the difference in VTE risk between COC generations.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Valproic acid (VPA) is a widely prescribed anticonvulsant drug.We hypothesized that treatment with VPA would improve the regulation of glucose and atherogenic dyslipidemia through reduction in circulating corticosterone.Female Wistar rats recieved (p.o.) combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing 1.0 µg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 µg  and valproic acid (VPA; 20 mg) for 8 weeks.Treatment with COC led to elevated fasting blood glucose, insulin, corticosterone, triglycerides (TG), TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio, insulin resistance (IR) and impaired glucose tolerance. VPA significantly attenuated the alterations induced by COC treatment, but did not affect the corticosterone level. However, VPA treatment led to significant increases in plasma insulin, corticosterone, atherogenic lipids and impaired glucose tolerance in rats not treated with COC.The findings in this study suggest that VPA mitigates against the development of COC-induced insulin resistance and dyslipidemia independent of elevated circulating corticosterone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29977039>Early phosphoproteomic changes for adverse outcome pathway development in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) brain.</a></h2><p>Adverse outcome  (AOPs) are conceptual frameworks that organize and link contaminant-induced mechanistic molecular changes to adverse biological responses at the individual and population level. AOPs leverage molecular and high content mechanistic information for regulatory decision-making, but most current AOPs for hormonally active agents (HAAs) focus on nuclear receptor-mediated effects only despite the overwhelming evidence that HAAs also activate membrane receptors. Activation of membrane receptors triggers non-genomic signaling cascades often transduced by protein phosphorylation leading to phenotypic changes. We utilized label-free LC-MS/MS to identify proteins differentially phosphorylated in the brain of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) aqueously exposed for 30 minutes to two HAAs, 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), a strong estrogenic substance, and  (LNG), a progestin, both components of the birth control pill. EE2 promoted differential phosphorylation of proteins involved in neuronal processes such as nervous system development, synaptic transmission, and neuroprotection, while LNG induced differential phosphorylation of proteins involved in axon cargo transport and calcium ion homeostasis. EE2 and LNG caused similar enrichment of synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. This study is the first to identify molecular changes in vivo in fish after short-term exposure and highlights transduction of rapid signaling mechanisms as targets of HAAs, in addition to nuclear receptor-mediated .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30191262>The effect of laquinimod, a novel immuno-modulator in development to treat Huntington disease, on the pharmacokinetics of ethinylestradiol and  in healthy young women.</a></h2><p>Laquinimod is an orally dosed immuno-modulator currently under development for Huntington's disease (HD). Preclinical findings suggest potential teratogenicity of laquinimod, thus the reproductive ability of females with HD treated with laquinimod needs to be closely managed. Because combined oral contraceptives (COC) are often used in this context, the pharmacokinetics of COC containing ethinylestradiol (EE) and  (LNG) in combination with laquinimod (0.6 mg/day) was evaluated.In this randomized, phase-1 single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover drug-drug interaction (DDI) study in 48 healthy premenopausal women, COC were administered in a 28-day regimen of 21 days followed by 7 pill-free days for 4 cycles and laquinimod or placebo was administered for 28 days in cycle 1 and cycle 3 starting 7 days prior to COC administration. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic profiling of laquinimod, EE and LNG were collected on day 21 and day 22 of Cycles 1 and 3 pre-dose and multiple times post-dose.The ratio of geometric means and 90% confidence intervals for AUC and C of EE and LNG with and without laquinimod were all within the bioequivalence range (80 to 125%). Laquinimod pharmacokinetics was consistent with those observed in previous studies. The adverse event profile was in line with the current knowledge on the safety profile of both drugs, with headache as the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse event.The combination of COC and laquinimod treatment was found to be safe, tolerable, and devoid of any noticeable pharmacokinetic interaction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29051119>Novel dissolving microneedles for enhanced transdermal delivery of : In vitro and in vivo characterization.</a></h2><p>Dissolving microneedles (DMN) have been studied as a drug delivery system to enhance the transport of drug molecules across the skin with almost no pain. However, the poor dissolving ability of microneedles in the skin and low drug loading have limited their potential application. The aim of this study was to develop a novel dissolving microneedle system with improved dissolving ability for the delivery of poorly water soluble contraception drug,  (LNG). Chitosan and beta-sodium glycerophosphate (β-GP) were incorporated in the formulation of microneedles. It was found that 69.32±4.23% of the microneedles penetrated through the skin and dissolved within the first 2h, which was almost 2-fold higher than that of the conventional microneedles. In addition, drug loading was significantly increased by packaging LNG into the molecules of hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) to form LNG-HP-β-CD inclusion compounds. The use of chitosan and β-GP together with HP-β-CD inclusion compounds was shown to enhance the bioavailability of LNG transdermally. This novel DMN system resulted in a similar pharmacokinetic profile as that following oral administration. In addition to similar C and AUC values, drug concentrations in the blood were more consistent following the DMN in comparison to oral administration.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Dienogest and IS were extracted from human plasma using simple liquid-liquid extraction. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Zorbax XDB-Phenyl column (4.6 × 75 mm, 3.5 µm) under isocratic conditions using acetonitrile-5 mm ammonium acetate (70:30, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.60 mL/min. The protonated precursor to product ion transitions monitored for dienogest and IS were at m/z 312.30 → 135.30 and 319.00 → 251.30, respectively. The method was validated with a linearity range of 1.003-200.896 ng/mL having a total analysis time for each chromatograph of 3.0 min. The method has shown tremendous reproducibility with intra- and inter-day precision (coefficient of variation) <3.97 and 6.10%, respectively, and accuracy within ±4.0% of nominal values. The validated method was applied to a pharmacokinetic study in human plasma samples generated after administration of a single oral dose of 2.0 mg dienogest tablets to healthy female volunteers and was proved to be highly reliable for the analysis of clinical samples.Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28092737>Complex molecular changes induced by chronic progestogens exposure in roach, Rutilus rutilus.</a></h2><p>In our previous study, we measured 0.23-13.67ng/L progestogens (progesterone, drospirenone, ) in natural waters in the catchment area of the largest shallow lake of Central Europe, Lake Balaton. Progestogen contaminations act as potent steroids with mixed progestagenic, androgenic and mild estrogenic effects that is why our aim was to investigate the morphological and molecular effects of mixture of progesterone, drospirenone, and  in environmentally relevant (10ng/L) and higher (50 and 500ng/L) exposure concentrations in common roach, Rutilus rutilus. Steroids (e.g. progestogens) and the protein deglycase DJ-1 chaperon molecule aim the same target molecules in cells, therefore, we hypothesized that a relationship may exist between progestogens and DJ-1. Furthermore, our other aim was to follow the changes of signal molecules of different biological function due to progestogen treatment in serum and brain. Adult roaches were exposed to 10, 50 and 500ng/L of mixture of progestogen for 42 days and their somatic indices (brain-somatic, liver-somatic, gonadosomatic and kidney-somatic) were measured. Vitellogenin (VTG) expression (estrogen effect) or inhibition (androgen effect) in fish is a widely used biomarker so we measured its changes in liver by ELISA. To determine the quantity and to map the spatial distribution of DJ-1 chaperon protein the brain and liver tissues were analyzed by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we also studied molecular alterations: a) in the serum by measuring cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglyceride concentrations and b) in brain homogenate using a cell stress array kit (26 protein). The somatic index of liver and kidney significantly in all the treated groups, whereas the gonadosomatic index of 500ng/L treated group showed significant decrease compared to control animals. VTG level increased significantly in 500ng/L progestogen treated group. Since the concentration of DJ-1 significantly increased in brain and liver in all progestogen treatment groups, the DJ-1 protein could be able to a more sensitive marker than VTG. Serum LDL and cholesterol levels of exposed fish were significantly decreased. DJ-1 was mediated through the stimulation of the expression of LDL-receptor which facilitates reuptake subsequently. In summary, our observations unfolded new data about molecular alterations induced by the combined action of environmental progestogens. In addition, the DJ-1 chaperon protein as a possible biomarker helped to trace the abiotic chemical environmental contaminations, like progestogens in the freshwater ecosystems.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We sought to evaluate the extent of hemostatic variable changes during the initial OC cycle and if such changes are related to systemic ethinyl estradiol (EE2) exposure.Participants provided multiple blood samples during a 21-day OC cycle (30mcg EE2; 150mcg ) and after a single dose following a washout period. Analytes included D-dimer, factor VIII activity, protein C total antigen and the hepatic proteins corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) and sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). EE2 pharmacokinetic analyses related to the 24h after the first OC tablet (OC1) and at steady state (OC21).Seventeen women completed the study. D-dimer more than doubled by OC6 (p=.013) and remained elevated at OC21 (p=.012). D-dimer levels within women varied widely from day to day. Factor VIII increased 27% by OC2 (p<.001) but declined to a 9% increase by OC21. Protein C increased only 6%. EE2 steady-state area-under-the-curve ranged from 488 to 1103pg∙h/mL; higher levels were not correlated with greater increases in clotting variables. CBG and SHBG increased significantly but were not significantly correlated with levels of EE2 or with the hemostatic variables.D-dimer increases during the first OC cycle were at least as great as increases seen with longer OC use. These results provide support for the increased VTE risk during initial OC use. The extreme variability in D-dimer levels may be an important component of this risk.This study showed that increases in D-dimer are clearly evident in the first cycle of OC use and may be larger than are seen after a longer duration of use and thus provide biological support for the increased VTE risk during initial OC use found in epidemiological studies.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The present studies assessed the potential for pharmacokinetic interaction between fostamatinib and the commonly prescribed medications oral contraceptive (OC), warfarin, and statins (rosuvastatin, simvastatin) in healthy subjects.The OC study was a crossover study over two 28-day treatment periods (Microgynon(®) 30 plus placebo or fostamatinib). Concentrations of OC constituents (ethinyl estradiol/) were measured. Effects on warfarin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were assessed (21-day study). Warfarin was administered on days 1 and 14, fostamatinib on days 8-20. The statin study was a two-period, fixed-sequence study of the effects of fostamatinib on exposure to rosuvastatin or simvastatin (single doses). Safety was assessed throughout.Fostamatinib co-administration with OC increased exposure to ethinyl estradiol [area under the plasma concentration-time curve at steady state (AUCss) 28% [confidence interval (CI 90%) 21-36]; maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) at steady state (Cmax,ss) 34% (CI 26-43)], but not  (AUCss 5%; Cmax,ss -3%), while exposure to luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone decreased (≈ 20%).

Clinical and preclinical studies have shown that low estradiol levels during extinction of fear conditioning in rodents (i.e., cue exposure therapy in humans) leads to poor extinction consolidation and increased fear during extinction recall. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is also associated with stress-related pathologies, and RAS antagonists can enhance extinction consolidation in males. However, less is known about how estradiol and the RAS converge to alter fear extinction consolidation in females. Since estradiol downregulates the RAS, we determined the role of surgically (via ovariectomy [OVX]) and pharmacologically (via the hormonal contraceptive [HC], ) clamping estradiol at low levels in female rats on fear-related behavior, serum estradiol and angiotensin II (Ang II) levels, and angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) binding in the brain. We then tested whether the AT1R antagonist losartan would alter fear-related behavior in an estradiol-dependent manner. We found that both OVX and HC treatment produced extinction consolidation deficits relative to intact female rats in proestrus (when estradiol levels are high), and that losartan treatment mitigated these deficits and reduced freezing. OVX, but not HC, altered AT1R ligand binding, though HC reduced estradiol and increased Ang II levels in plasma. These findings have significant clinical implications, indicating that administration of an AT1R antagonist, especially if estradiol levels are low, prior to an exposure therapy session may improve treatment outcomes in females.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26425002>Controversies in contraception for women with epilepsy.</a></h2><p>Contraception is an important choice that offers autonomy to women with regard to prevention of unintended pregnancies. There is wide variation in the contraceptive practices between continents, countries, and societies. The medical eligibility for contraception for sexually active women with epilepsy (WWE) is determined by the type of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that they use. Enzyme inducing AEDs such as phenobarbitone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and oxcarbazepine increase the  of orally administered estrogen (and progesterone to a lesser extent). Estrogen can increase the  of certain AEDs, such as lamotrigine, leading to cyclical variation in its blood level with resultant adverse effect profile or seizure dyscontrol. AEDs and sex hormones can increase the risk of osteoporosis and fracture in WWE. The potential interactions between AEDs and hormonal contraception need to be discussed with all women in reproductive age-group. The alternate options of oral contraception such as intrauterine copper device, intrauterine  release system, and supplementary protection with barriers need to be presented to them. World Health Organization has recommended to avoid combination contraceptive pills containing estrogen and progesteron in women who desire contraception and in breastfeeding mothers.

Rates of contraceptive use are similar among women of all weights, but because contraceptive development studies historically excluded women over 130% of ideal body weight, patients and providers have a gap in understanding of contraceptive efficacy for obese and overweight women. Because of a range of drug  alterations in obesity, there is biologic plausibility for changes in hormonal contraception effectiveness in obese women. However, these pharmacokinetic changes are not linearly related to body mass index or weight, and it is unknown what degree of obesity begins to affect pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics processes. Overall, most studies of higher quality do not demonstrate a difference in oral contraceptive pill effectiveness in obese compared with non-obese women. However, data are scant for women in the highest categories of obesity, and differences by progestin type are incompletely understood. Effectiveness of most non-oral contraceptives does not seem to be compromised in obesity. Exceptions to this include the combined hormonal patch and oral  emergency contraception, which may have lower rates of effectiveness in obese women. The purpose of this review is to summarize evidence on contraceptive use in women with obesity, including differences in steroid hormone , contraceptive effectiveness, and safety, compared with women of normal weight or body mass index using the same methods.Copyright © 2016 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

Review.</a></h2><p>Considerable progress has been made in learning about the physiology and biochemistry of the sebaceous glands and several of the diseases that affect this component of the skin. Of these diseases, acne has particular importance. It is associated with adolescence, and because of the hormonal changes that take place in this stage, when it is severe it can cause depression. Moreover, in a considerable proportion of acne sufferers both adolescent and adult, it can produce tumors and deformation of the sebaceous glands. This seriously affects the sufferers to the point where it may limit their professional activities because they do not want to be seen in public. Several important issues from classic studies on the sebaceous gland will be reviewed in this document to report the state of the art of current treatments for the pathology of these glands. The sebaceous gland is an intracrine organ, capable of synthesizing and metabolizing different steroidal hormones. The role of each of the enzymes involved in these processes of the skin will be analyzed. The presence of different hormone receptors in the scientific literature will be also reviewed, due to the role of the sebaceous gland in lipogenesis at different ages. We also describe the mechanism of action of androgens and progestins in relation to coregulators recruited for lipogenesis in this gland. We propose several new steroidal compounds based on their mechanism of action to block lipogenesis in the sebaceous glands. These molecules offer potential for new treatment options for skin diseases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27000996>Impact of obesity on the pharmacokinetics of -based emergency contraception: single and double dosing.</a></h2><p>To determine if differences exist in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of -based emergency contraception (LNG-EC) in obese and normal body mass index (BMI) users and test whether doubling the dose of LNG-EC in obese women increases total and free (active) LNG serum concentrations.Healthy, reproductive-age women with obese and normal BMIs received 1.5mg LNG orally (ECx1) and then in a subsequent menstrual cycle, the obese group also received 3mg LNG (ECx2). Dosing occurred during the follicular phase. Total and free LNG PK parameters were obtained via serum samples through an indwelling catheter at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5h. The primary outcome was the difference in total and free LNG concentration maximum (Cmax) between ECx1 and ECx2 in the obese group.A total of 10 women enrolled and completed the study (normal BMI=5, median 22.8kg/m(2), range 20.8-23.7; obese BMI=5, 39.5kg/m(2), range 35.9-46.7). The total LNG Cmax for obese subjects following ECx1 (5.57±2.48ng/mL) was significantly lower than the level observed in normal BMI women (10.30±2.47, p=.027). Notably, ECx2 increased the Cmax significantly (10.52±2.76, p=.002); approximating the level in normal BMI subjects receiving ECx1. Free LNG Cmax followed a similar pattern.Obesity adversely impacts both the total and free Cmax levels of LNG EC and this likely explains its lack of efficacy in obese women. Doubling the dose appears to correct the obesity-related PK changes but additional research is needed to determine if this also improves EC effectiveness in obese women.This study demonstrates that obesity interferes with the pharmacokinetics of LNG EC, and that doubling the dose may be an effective strategy to improve its efficacy in obese women.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we investigated whether anti-thyroidal effects are a common property of progestins other than LNG. Premetamorphic Xenopus laevis tadpoles were exposed to norethisterone (NET) and dienogest DIE (each at 0.1-10nM) and LNG (10nM) until completion of metamorphosis. LNG and NET at all concentrations caused a significant developmental retardation whereas DIE did not impair time to metamorphosis. In LNG and 10nM NET exposed animals, tsh mRNA levels increased considerably later than the developmental delay occurred and thyroid histopathology showed no signs of TSH-hyperstimulation. Instead, thyroid glands from these treatments appeared inactive in producing thyroid hormones. Thyroidal transcript levels of dio2 and dio3 were increased by treatments with LNG and NET at 1nM and 10nM, whereas iyd mRNA was reduced by LNG and 10nM NET. Expression of slc5α5 was not changed by any treatment. Effects of DIE differed from those induced by LNG and NET. No developmental delay was measurable; however, tshβ and dio2 mRNAs were increased in pituitary glands of tadpoles exposed to 1.0nM and 10nM DIE. Thyroid histopathology displayed no abnormalities and thyroidal mRNA expression of the genes analyzed (slc5α5, iyd, dio2, dio3) was not changed by DIE. Overall, our results provide evidence that the anti-thyroidal effects already known from LNG are also present in another progestin, namely NET, even at environmentally relevant concentrations. In conclusion we suggest that progestins do not only pose an environmental risk in terms of their impact on reproductive success of aquatic vertebrates, but also with respect to their anti-thyroidal properties affecting amphibian metamorphosis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This tumour is rarely diagnosed in the reproductive age. Complete surgical resection is the only curative treatment for adrenal cancer in all stages. After surgery adjuvant chemotherapy is required. Mitotane is the most important drug in adrenal cancer chemotherapy. Mitotane's mode of action is not entirely explained. Animal studies have shown that the substance exerts a direct cytotoxic effect on the cells of the adrenal cortex. This activity is selective, progressive and affects only the zona reticularis and fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. Mitotane inhibits cortisol synthesis by disrupting the chain of cholesterol. It has been suggested, that mitotane also affects the peripheral  of steroids, especially of transcortin (CBG). This results in an increase of CBG blood concentration and a reduction of the amount of free hormones.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28315609>The -releasing intrauterine device potentiates stress reactivity.</a></h2><p>The -releasing intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) is currently recommended as a first-line contraceptive with an exclusively local intrauterine influence. However, recent clinical trials have identified side effects of LNG-IUD that appear to be systemically mediated, including depressed mood and emotional lability.We performed two experimental studies and a cross-sectional study. For each study, women were included from three groups: LNG-IUD (0.02mg/24h), oral ethinylestradiol/ (0.03mg/0.15mg; EE30/LNG) and natural cycling (NC). Study 1-Salivary cortisol was measured at baseline and at defined intervals following the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Heart rate was monitored continuously throughout the TSST. Study 2-Salivary cortisol and serum total cortisol were evaluated relative to low-dose (1μg) adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) administration. Study 3-Hair cortisol was measured as a naturalistic index of long-term cortisol exposure.Women using LNG-IUD had an exaggerated salivary cortisol response to the TSST (24.95±13.45 nmol/L, 95% CI 17.49-32.40), compared to EE30/LNG (3.27±2.83 nmol/L, 95% CI 1.71-4.84) and NC (10.85±11.03nmol/L, 95% CI 6.30-15.40) (P<0.0001). Heart rate was significantly potentiated during the TSST in women using LNG-IUD (P=0.047). In response to ACTH challenge, women using LNG-IUD and EE30/LNG had a blunted salivary cortisol response, compared to NC (P<0.0001). Women using LNG-IUD had significantly elevated levels of hair cortisol compared to EE30/LNG or NC (P<0.0001).Our findings suggest that LNG-IUD contraception induces a centrally-mediated sensitization of both autonomic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responsivity. LNG-IUD sensitization of HPA axis responsivity was observed acutely under standardized laboratory conditions, as well as chronically under naturalistic conditions.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Nine women chose the -containing IUCD and eight chose a copper IUCD. A cervico-vaginal swab was collected for cytokine analysis pre-insertion and four weeks post-insertion. Significant increases were noted in levels of IL-1α (median 483.4 versus 316.6 pg/mL, p = 0.046), IL-1β (median 605.7 versus 147.3 pg/mL, p = 0.018), IL-6 (median 570.1 versus 157.3 pg/mL, p = 0.046), TNFα (median 1.19 versus 0.6 pg/mL, p = 0.029) and the chemokine MCP-1 (median 340.2 versus 135.2 pg/mL, p = 0.003). No significant changes were noted in the levels of GM-CSF, IL-8, MIG, MIP-3α, RANTES, IL-10, IL-17, IP-10, MIP-1β.

Combined oral contraceptive (COC) treatment is associated with impaired glucose and lipid  but the mechanisms are elusive. We therefore, hypothesized that DPP-4 inhibition ameliorates COC-induced glucose dysregulation and hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation through adenosine deaminase (ADA) /xanthine oxidase (XO) /uric acid-dependent pathway. Female Wistar rats received (po) vehicle and COC (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 μg ; po) with or without DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin; 100 mg/kg; po) for 8 weeks (n = 6/group). Glucose dysmetabolism was assessed by elevated fasting blood glucose, impaired oral glucose tolerance test and homeostatic model assessment of IR. Treatment with COC led to increased plasma fasting glucose, triglyceride-glucose index, 1-h postload glucose response, insulin, free fatty acid, IR and impaired glucose tolerance. COC treatment also resulted in increased plasma and hepatic TG, TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio, malondialdehyde, uric acid (plasma; 25.2 ± 0.6 mg/dl; hepatic 128.9 ± 8.0 mg/100 mg tissue), lactate dehydrogenase, DPP-4, ADA and XO (plasma;10.5 ± 1.1 U/L; hepatic 21.2 ± 1.4 U/g protein) activities. Likewise, COC led to reduction in nitric oxide level. However, DPP-4 inhibition significantly ameliorated these alterations induced by COC treatment through suppression of uric acid (plasma; 15.1 ± 1.0 mg/dl, hepatic; 75.6 ± 5.0 mg/100 mg tissue), XO (plasma; 4.1 ± 0.9 U/L, hepatic; 8.7 ± 0.4 U/g protein), ADA and DPP-4 activities suggesting their involvement in glucose dysregulation and hepatic TG accumulation induced by COC treatment. Therefore, DPP-4 inhibition would impact positively on cardiometabolic disorders, at least in part, through XO, ADA and uric acid suppression.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

The therapy given was a combination of  (between 0.10 and 0.25 mg) and ethinylestradiol (between 0.02 and 0.05 mg). We determined the mean number of transfusions required in the 6 months before and after the start of the treatment, as well as the mean haemoglobin levels, number of admissions for anaemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding and length of hospital stay in these periods.The mean age of patients included was 77.83 years old and 75% were male. The follow-up period after treatment initiation was 6 months. Of the 12 patients included, only one stopped the treatment owing to it not being effective. Overall, 83.3% of the patients reported subjective improvement. Furthermore, we found significant differences comparing before and after starting treatment regarding the mean number of transfusions (7±4.8 vs. 3.4±4.6; P=0.005), the mean haemoglobin levels (9.5±1.2 vs. 10.8±2.6; P=0.034) and the mean number of admissions (1.6±1.6 vs. 0.2±0.4; P=0.024).

Liquid-liquid extraction procedure using hexane:ethyl acetate mixture at 80:20 v:v ratio was employed to efficiently extract LNG from rat plasma. Reversed phase Luna column C18(2) (50×2.0mm i.d., 3μM) installed on a AB SCIEX Triple Quad™ 4500 LC/MS/MS system was used to perform chromatographic separation. LNG was identified within 2min with high specificity. Linear calibration curve was drawn within 0.5-50ng·mL(-1) concentration range. The developed method was validated for intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision whose values fell in the acceptable limits. Matrix effect was found to be minimal. Recovery efficiency at three quality control (QC) concentrations 0.5 (low), 5 (medium) and 50 (high) ng·mL(-1) was found to be >90%. Stability of LNG at various stages of experiment including storage, extraction and analysis was evaluated using QC samples, and the results showed that LNG was stable at all the conditions. This validated method was successfully used to study the pharmacokinetics of LNG in rats after SubQ injection, providing its applicability in relevant preclinical studies.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Tofacitinib  is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4. This phase 1 randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover study () evaluated the effect of tofacitinib 30 mg twice daily on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of combination oral contraceptives ethinylestradiol (EE) and  (LN). EE and LN were administered as a single Microgynon 30® tablet (30 μg EE and 150 μg LN) to 19 healthy women. In the presence of tofacitinib, the area under the curve from time zero to infinity (AUC∞ ) increased by 6.6% and 0.9% for EE and LN, respectively. Maximal plasma concentrations decreased by 10.4% for EE and increased by 12.2% for LN when coadministered with tofacitinib. The 90% confidence intervals for the adjusted geometric mean ratios for AUC∞ fell within the 80%-125% region for both EE and LN. Mean half-life was similar in the presence and absence of tofacitinib: 13.8 and 13.3 hours, respectively, for EE; 25.9 and 25.4 hours, respectively, for LN. Tofacitinib had no clinically relevant net inhibitory or inductive effect on the pharmacokinetics of EE and LN. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest dose adjustments of oral contraceptive drugs containing EE or LN when coadministered with tofacitinib.© 2016, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28262240>Heavy menstrual bleeding: An update on management.</a></h2><p>Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is defined as excessive menstrual blood loss (MBL) >80 mL per cycle, that interferes with a woman's physical, emotional, social wellbeing and quality of life. Aetiology is due to underlying uterine pathologies, coagulopathy, ovulation dysfunction, or iatrogenic. Up to 20% of women with HMB will have an underlying inherited bleeding disorder (IBD). Assessment of HMB should entail a menstrual and gynaecological history and a bleeding score to distinguish those women who require additional haematological investigations. A pelvic examination and ultrasound scan help to rule out presence of any underlying pathology. Management depends on the underlying cause and the woman's preference and her fertility wishes. Medical therapies include hormonal treatments; -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) and combined hormonal contraceptives are most commonly used. Ulipristal acetate is an approved preoperative treatment for uterine fibroids, and has demonstrated efficacy in reducing MBL. Haemostatic therapies include tranexamic acid and DDAVP (1-deamino-8-D-arginine). DDAVP is used for HMB associated with certain IBDs. These therapies can be used in isolation or in combination with hormonal treatments. HMB associated with certain severe IBDs may require factor concentrate administration during menses to alleviate symptoms. Endometrial ablation is a minor surgical procedure that is associated with low operative morbidity and can be performed as an outpatient. Hysterectomy remains the definitive treatment of choice when medical therapies have failed and endometrial ablation is not suitable.Crown Copyright © 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It is thus important to understand the relationship between steroid receptor cross-reactivity and the side-effect profile of progestins. In cell lines that express negligible levels of steroid receptors, we report for the first time the binding affinities, potencies and efficacies of selected progestins from different generations determined in parallel. We show that the progestins bind to the androgen receptor (AR) with similar affinities to each other and progesterone, while none bind estrogen receptor (ER)-β, and only norethisterone acetate,  and gestodene bind ERα. Comparative dose-response analysis revealed that progestins from the first three generations display similar androgenic activity to the natural androgen dihydrotestosterone for transactivation, while norethisterone acetate,  and gestodene are ERα agonists. We show for the first time that the anti-androgenic properties of progesterone and drospirenone are similar to the well-known AR antagonist hydroxyflutamide, while nomegestrol acetate is more potent and nestorone less potent than both hydroxyflutamide and progesterone. Moreover, we are the first to report that the older progestins, unlike progesterone and the fourth generation progestins, are efficacious ERα agonists for transrepression, while the selected progestins from the second and third generation are efficacious AR agonists for transrepression. Considering the progestin potencies and their reported free serum concentrations relative to dihydrotestosterone and estradiol, our results suggest that the progestins are likely to exert AR-, but not ERα- or ERβ-mediated effects in vivo.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, based on some new data, we are discovering that this pathology can emerge or reappear at this period of life. Clinicians must consider it as a possible cause for cases of pelvic pain, and heavy bleeding. Authors have described a possibility of transformation of the intraperitoneal proliferation into a malignant type with ovarian, bowel and even lung metastasis. The risk of transformation into an ovarian cancer is around 2 or 3%. The role of menopausal hormonal therapy will be discussed as in recurrence in the case of residue existence, especially after incomplete surgery. Is it possible to prescribe hormonal therapy to a menopausal women suffering climacteric symptoms as it could trigger a recurrence of endometriosis and even an increased risk of malignant degeneration?

We hypothesized that disruption of glucoregulation and liver triglyceride (TG) accumulation induced by COC use would be abated by valproic acid (VPA) treatment through suppression of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and xanthine oxidase (XO) activities. Female Wistar rats aged 9-10 weeks were treated with a combination of estrogen-progestin COC steroids (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol and 5.0 μg ; p.o.) with or without VPA (100.0 mg/kg; p.o.) daily for 6 weeks. The result shows that the disrupted glucoregulation and associated elevated hepatic ADA activity, plasma and hepatic XO activity, uric acid (UA), TG/HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, and malondialdehyde induced by COC treatment were attenuated by VPA treatment. However, VPA did not have any effect on plasma aldosterone, corticosterone, ADA, circulating and hepatic free fatty acid. Our results demonstrate that suppression of plasma and hepatic XO activities, along with hepatic ADA activity and UA by VPA treatment, protects against disrupted glucoregulation and increased liver TG by COC independent of elevated corticosteroids. The findings imply that VPA would provide protection against the development of cardiometabolic disorder via inhibition of the ADA/XO/UA-mediated pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26194214>Ethinyl estradiol and  in a transdermal contraceptive delivery system.</a></h2><p>The new transdermal contraceptive delivery system (TCDS) developed by Agile Therapeutics containing ethinyl estradiol and  (EE/LNG) is a reversible contraceptive method that maintains stable serum levels of both estrogen and progestin, and has efficacy similar to that of combination oral contraceptives (COC).We provided information of this new TCDS compared with the only TCDS available on the market that contains EE and norelgestromin, and has a higher EE exposure than a COC with 35 µg of EE potentially increasing the risk of venous thromboembolism.

The -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is effective for the medical treatment of adenomyosis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which LNG-IUS ameliorates adenomyosis pathology remain unclear. This study was designed to compare the expression levels of steroid receptor coregulators in human endometrium of control and participants with adenomyosis and to determine whether LNG-IUS modulated their expression. Immunohistochemistry with H-scores was performed. Steroid receptor coactivators were shown to have significantly decreased expressions at the secretory phase in the LNG-IUS group when compared to the other groups. Expression of transcriptional intermediary factor 2 was lower in the LNG-IUS group than in both the control group (P = .015) and the untreated adenomyosis group (P = .019) during the secretory phase. Amplified in breast cancer 1 expression was higher in the stromal cells of the untreated adenomyosis group than in those of the controls (P = .017) during the secretory phase; however, levels were lower in the LNG-IUS group (P = .005). Nuclear receptor corepressor expression increased during the proliferative phase and decreased during the secretory phase in untreated adenomyosis; this pattern was reversed in the control and LNG-IUS groups. Thus, an altered expression of steroid receptor coregulators may play a role in adenomyosis development and treatment.© The Author(s) 2015.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29121217>Effect of ulipristal acetate and mifepristone at emergency contraception dose on the embryo-endometrial attachment using an in vitro human trophoblastic spheroid and endometrial cell co-culture model.</a></h2><p>Do both ulipristal acetate (UPA) and mifepristone inhibit embryo-endometrial attachment at concentrations corresponding to the emergency contraception (EC) dose?Both UPA and mifepristone at concentrations corresponding to the EC dose do not have an inhibitory effect on embryo implantation, although mifepristone at a higher concentration appeared to have such an effect. is commonly used for EC, but it only acts through inhibition of ovulation. UPA and mifepristone have higher efficacy as EC compared to ; while there is some suggestion that mifepristone may interfere with implantation, whether UPA has post-ovulatory action in inhibiting implantation is yet to be confirmed.An in vitro experimental study using trophoblastic spheroids made from JAr cell line as the embryo surrogate, and the Ishikawa cell line and primary human endometrial cells cultured to monolayer as the endometrial surrogate. The primary endometrial cells were collected from nine volunteer women in the mid-luteal phase with consent.The study was conducted in a university gynaecology unit. The JAr and Ishikawa cell lines (or primary endometrial cells) were treated with graded concentrations of UPA (0, 0.04, 0.4 and 4 μM) or mifepristone (0, 0.1, 1 and 10 μM) for 24 h. Embryo-endometrial attachment was studied using an in vitro JAr spheroid-endometrial co-culture model. Expressions of progesterone receptor, β-catenin and glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK-3β) were studied with real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively.In the Ishikawa experiments, there was no significant difference in the JAr spheroid attachment rate after treatment with UPA at 0 (93.0%), 0.04 (93.6%), 0.4 (93.4%) and 4 (91.4%) μM concentrations (P > 0.05); the attachment rate was reduced after treatment with mifepristone only at 10 μM (79.8%, P < 0.0001) but not at 0.1 (92.1%) or 1.0 (95.2%) μM concentrations. In the primary endometrial cell experiments, again no significant difference was observed in the JAr spheroid attachment rate after treatment with UPA 4 μM (42.6%) compared to control (46.5%, P > 0.05). Both UPA and mifepristone could significantly up-regulate progesterone receptor expression. There was no significant alteration in expression of β-catenin and GSK-3β after treatment with UPA 4 μM or mifepristone 10 μM (P > 0.05).The co-culture model is only a surrogate which may not fully represent the complicated process of embryo implantation in vivo, although there is no existing perfect model for studying implantation in vitro which fully resembles the latter.The lack of inhibitory effect on embryo implantation by UPA and possibly mifepristone at concentrations corresponding to the EC dose is an important information for contraceptive counseling.We had free supply of the UPA compound used in this study from Laboratoire HRA Pharma.

In this cross-sectional study, the study groups consisted of control group that represented by 30 healthy married women who were not on any contraceptive mean or any hormonal therapy and had normal menstrual cycles, group two consisted of 30 women who were users of Levonorgesterl 0.15 mg plus Ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg as 21 days cycle, group three consisted of 30 women who were users of Gestodene 0.075 mg plus Ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg as 21 days cycle, and group four consisted of 30 women who were users of Drospirenone 3 mg plus Ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg as 21 days cycle. One-way analysis of variance followed by LSD post hoc test was used for comparison of variables. P value <0.05 was considered to be significant. The comparison of the studied groups revealed that COCPs containing  plus ethinylestradiol resulted in significantly lower adiponectin level, and significantly higher leptin and resistin levels with more atherogenic lipid profile presented by significantly higher LDL-C, significantly lower HDL-C concentrations, and significantly higher atherogenic index. Formulation containing ethinylestradiol combined with gestodene neither altered adipose tissue function nor showed deleterious effect on lipid panel. Formulation containing ethinylestradiol combined with drospirenone resulted in significantly higher HDL-C and adiponectin concentrations. In conclusion, the uptake of COCPs containing  plus ethinylestradiol is associated with high cardiovascular risk since this formulation showed significantly lower adiponectin concentration, significantly higher leptin, resistin, and atherogenic index as compared to other studied groups. By contrast, the formulations containing ethinylestradiol combined with third generation progestin gestodene or fourth generation progestin drospirenone are associated with low cardiovascular risk since they neither altered adipose tissue function nor impaired lipoprotein  as experienced by their favorable effect on leptin, adiponectin, and resistin, with non-changed atherogenic index, higher HDL-C levels and lower LDL-C levels as compared to  plus ethinylestradiol formulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27437931>The Effects of Hormones and Vaginal Microflora on the Glycome of the Female Genital Tract: Cervical-Vaginal Fluid.</a></h2><p>In this study, we characterized the glycome of cervical-vaginal fluid, collected with a Catamenial cup. We quantified: glycosidase levels; sialic acid and high mannose specific lectin binding; mucins, MUC1, MUC4, MUC5AC, MUC7; and albumin in the samples collected. These data were analyzed in the context of hormonal status (day of menstrual cycle, hormonal contraception use) and role, if any, of the type of the vaginal microflora present. When the Nugent score was used to stratify the subjects by microflora as normal, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis, several important differences were observed. The activities of four of six glycosidases in the samples from women with bacterial vaginosis were significantly increased when compared to normal or intermediate women: sialidase, P = <0.001; α-galactosidase, P = 0.006; β-galactosidase, P = 0.005; α-glucosidase, P = 0.056. Sialic acid binding sites as measured by two lectins, Maackia amurensis and Sambucus nigra binding, were significantly lower in women with BV compared to women with normal and intermediate scores (P = <0.0001 and 0.008 respectively). High mannose binding sites, a measure of innate immunity were also significantly lower in women with BV (P = <0.001). Additionally, we observed significant increases in MUC1, MUC4, MUC5AC, and MUC7 concentrations in women with BV (P = <0.001, 0.001, <0.001, 0.02 respectively). Among normal women we found that the membrane bound mucin MUC4 and the secreted MUC5AC were decreased in postmenopausal women (P = 0.02 and 0.07 respectively), while MUC7 (secreted) was decreased in women using -containing IUDs (P = 0.02). The number of sialic acid binding sites was lower in the postmenopausal group (P = 0.04), but the number of high mannose binding sites, measured with Griffithsin, was not significantly different among the 6 hormonal groups. The glycosidase levels in the cervical-vaginal mucus were rather low in the groups, with exception of α-glucosidase activity that was much lower in the postmenopausal group (P<0.001). These studies present compelling evidence that the vaginal ecosystem responds to the presence of different vaginal microorganisms. These effects were so influential that it required us to remove subjects with BV for data interpretation of the impact of hormones. We also suggest that certain changes occurring in vaginal/cervical proteins are due to bacteria or their products. Therefore, the quantitation of vaginal mucins and lectin binding offers a new method to monitor bacteria-host interactions in the female reproductive tract. The data suggest that some of the changes in these components are the result of host processing, such as the increases in mucin content, while the microflora is responsible for the increases in glycosidases and the decreases in lectin binding. The methods should be considered a valid marker for insult to the female genital tract.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29253201>Impact of the -Releasing Intrauterine System on the Progression of Chlamydia trachomatis Infection to Pelvic Inflammatory Disease in a Baboon Model.</a></h2><p>Understanding the relationship between the  (LNG)-releasing intrauterine system (IUS) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is increasingly important as use of the LNG-IUS grows to include women at higher risk for STIs. This study assessed the impact of the LNG-IUS on development of Chlamydia trachomatis pelvic inflammatory disease, using a baboon model.Baboons with and those without the LNG-IUS were cervically inoculated with C. trachomatis and monitored daily, and cervical and fallopian tube swab specimens were collected weekly for C. trachomatis quantitation by nucleic acid amplification testing and culture. Vaginal swab specimens were collected for cytokine analysis, and serum samples were obtained for detection of C. trachomatis antibodies.The LNG-IUS resulted in an increased C. trachomatis burden in the cervix, with the bacterial burden in the LNG-IUS group diverging from that in the non-LNG-IUS group by 6 weeks after infection. One of 7 baboons in the non-LNG-IUS group and 2 of 6 in the LNG-IUS group developed pelvic inflammatory disease, while 3 animals in each group met criteria suggestive of pelvic inflammatory disease. LNG-IUS increased baseline interleukin 8 levels but failed to further upregulate interleukin 8 during infection. In LNG-IUS recipients, early perturbations in the interleukin 1β axis corresponded to decreased C. trachomatis clearance and increased T-helper type 2 immune responses.LNG-IUS use results in delayed clearance of C. trachomatis and might alter the reproductive tract immune environment.© The Author(s) 2017.

In this study, Guanzhong (GZ, n=350) and Boer (BE, n=196) goats were used to detect polymorphism in the promoter of the goat KISS1 gene by DNA sequencing. In the GZ goats, the g.1384G>A mutation was identified in the promoter of the goat KISS1 gene. Guanzhong goats were in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium at g.1384G>A locus (P<0.05). The 1384A allele was predicted to eliminate methylation, AHR-arnt heterodimers and AHR-related factors (AHRR) and myoblast determining factors (MYOD) transcription factor-binding sites. Statistical results indicated that the g.1384G>A SNP was associated with litter size in the GZ goats (P<0.05). Luciferase assay analysis suggested that the 1384A allele increased luciferase activity when compared to the 1384G allele. The RT-qPCR assay also demonstrated that the 1384A allele had greater amounts of KISS1 mRNA than the 1384G allele in homozygous individuals. Functional analysis suggested that this g.1384G>A SNP may be an important genetic regulator of KISS1 gene expression with effects on downstream processes that are modulated by KISS1 gene because of the changes of methylation and transcription factor-binding sites. Therefore, the current study provides evidence in goats for genetic markers that might be used in breeding programs.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

While estrogens and androgens were previously demonstrated to impact organisms during environmental exposures, progestagens have recently been shown to have strong impacts on aquatic organisms. To gain an understanding of the impacts of these types of chemicals on aquatic species, experiments evaluating the mechanisms of action of progestagen exposure were conducted with the Eastern Mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). The objective of this study was to conduct hepatic microarray analysis of male and female G. holbrooki exposed to progestins and anti-progestagens. In addition, we evaluated the ability of , a synthetic progesterone (progestin), to induce anal fin elongation and to determine how anal fin growth is modulated during co-exposures with progesterone and androgen receptor antagonists. Gene expression analyses were conducted on male and female G. holbrooki exposed for 48h to the agonist , the antagonist mifepristone, or a mixture of the two chemicals. Microarray analysis revealed that mifepristone does not act as an anti-progestagen in G. holbrooki in liver tissues, and that  elicits strong effects on the processes of embryo development and lipid transport.  was also demonstrated to induce male secondary sexual characteristic formation in females, and co-exposure of either an androgen or  in the presence of the anti-androgen flutamide prevented anal fin elongation. These results provide indications as to the potential impacts of progestins, including non-target effects such as secondary sexual characteristic formation, and demonstrate the importance of this class of chemicals on aquatic organisms.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Bioinformatic analysis of selected published microarray datasets identified differentially regulated genes for the early and mid-secretory phases relative to the proliferative phase. Diseases and Functions categories were identified with Ingenuity (IPA) 'core analysis' software. The key transcription factors controlling secretory phase gene changes were revealed with oPOSSUM software. FOXD3 expression levels were examined in human endometrial samples from women aged 18-55 years by WB, IHC, and qPCR. The progesterone regulation of endometrial FOXD3 levels was examined in vivo and in cultured primary human endometrial stromal cells in vitro.Initial data mining and subsequent bioinformatics analysis of human endometrial microarray datasets identified FOXD3 to be a key regulator of gene expression specific to secretory phase/endometriosis. FOXD3 was dynamically expressed in healthy endometrium and differentially expressed in endometriosis. In vitro decidualisation of primary endometrial stromal cells significantly decreased FOXD3 protein (P = 0.0005) and progestagen () treatment also reduced the high endometrial FOXD3 protein (P = 0.0001) and mRNA levels (P = 0.04) seen in untreated women with endometriosis, with a shift of FOXD3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.The quality of Bioinformatics analysis and results depends on the published micro-array data.An in depth analysis of FOXD3 function and its relationship with estrogen and progesterone might provide insights into its potential deregulation in proliferative disorders of the endometrium including endometrial cancer where its expression is also deregulated. Further, FOX transcription factors are increasingly seen as novel therapeutic targets in disease.We acknowledge the support by Wellbeing of Women project grant RG1073 (D.K.H., A.J.V.).

ASD is now diagnosed in more than one out of 100 children and is biased towards males by a ratio of at least 4:1. Many possible explanations and potential causative factors have been reported, such as genetics, sex, and environmental factors, although the detailed mechanisms of ASD remain unclear.The dams were exposed through oral contraceptives to either vehicle control (VEH) alone,  (LNG) alone, ethinyl estradiol (EE) alone, or a combination of LNG/EE for 21 days during their pregnancy. The subsequent 10-week-old offspring were used for autism-like behavior testing, and the limbic tissues were isolated for analysis. In another experimental group, 8-week-old male offspring were treated by infusion of ERβ overexpression/knockdown lentivirus in the amygdala, and the offspring were analyzed after 2 weeks.We show that prenatal exposure of either LNG alone or a LNG/EE combination, but not EE alone, results in suppression of ERβ (estrogen receptor β) and its target genes in the amygdala with autism-like behavior in male offspring, while there is a much smaller effect on female offspring. However, we find that there is no effect on the hippocampus and hypothalamus. Further investigation shows that ERβ suppression is due to LNG-mediated altered methylation on the ERβ promoter and results in tissue damage with oxidative stress and the dysfunction of mitochondria and fatty acid , which subsequently triggers autism-like behavior. Overexpression of ERβ in the amygdala completely restores LNG-induced ERβ suppression and autism-like behaviors in offspring, while ERβ knockdown mimics this effect, indicating that ERβ expression in the amygdala plays an important role in autism-like behavior development.We conclude that prenatal  exposure induces autism-like behavior in offspring through ERβ suppression in the amygdala. To our knowledge, this is the first time the potential effect of oral contraceptives on the contribution of autism-like behavior in offspring has been discovered.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25592051>Oral contraceptive use and saliva diurnal pattern of  steroid hormones in young healthy women.</a></h2><p>The impact of oral contraceptives (OCs) on the saliva diurnal pattern of  steroid hormones remained unknown.Saliva samples were taken from young healthy women (11 OC users, 10 non-OC users) to analyze cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and testosterone 4 times (days 1, 8, 15 and 22) over one menstrual cycle.OC use decreased saliva testosterone concentrations (p<.01) under all conditions of day and time, but not saliva cortisol.

Netupitant/palonosetron (NEPA), an oral fixed combination of netupitant (NETU)-a new NK1 RA-and PALO, is currently under development. In vitro data suggest that NETU inhibits CYP3A4 and is a substrate for and weak inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). This review evaluates potential drug-drug interactions between NETU or NEPA and CYP3A4 substrates/inducers/inhibitors or P-gp substrates in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated for each drug when NETU was coadministered with PALO (single doses) and when single doses of NETU or NEPA were coadministered with CYP3A4 substrates (erythromycin (ERY), midazolam (MID), dexamethasone (DEX), or oral contraceptives), inhibitors (ketoconazole (KETO)), or inducers (rifampicin (RIF)), or a P-gp substrate (digoxin (DIG)). Results showed no relevant PK interactions between NETU and PALO. Coadministration of NETU increased MID and ERY exposure and significantly increased DEX exposure in a dose-dependent manner; NETU exposure was unaffected. NEPA coadministration had no clinically significant effect on oral contraception, although  exposure increased. NETU exposure increased after coadministration of NEPA with KETO and decreased after coadministration with RIF; PALO exposure was unaffected. NETU coadministration did not influence DIG exposure. In conclusion, there were no clinically relevant interactions between NETU and PALO, or NEPA and oral contraceptives (based on  and ethinylestradiol exposure). Coadministration of NETU or NEPA with CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors/substrates should be done with caution. Dose reduction is recommended for DEX. Dose adjustments are not needed for NETU coadministration with P-gp substrates.© The Author(s) 2015.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25993513>Studying the effects of reproductive hormones and bacterial vaginosis on the glycome of lavage samples from the cervicovaginal cavity.</a></h2><p>The cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) coating the vaginal epithelium is an important immunological mediator, providing a barrier to infection. Glycosylation of CVF proteins, such as mucins, IgG and S-IgA, plays a critical role in their immunological functions. Although multiple factors, such as hormones and microflora, may influence glycosylation of the CVF, few studies have examined their impact on this important immunological fluid. Herein we analyzed the glycosylation of cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples collected from 165 women under different hormonal conditions including: (1) no contraceptive, post-menopausal, (2) no contraceptive, days 1-14 of the menstrual cycle, (3) no contraceptive, days 15-28 of the menstrual cycle, (4) combined-oral contraceptive pills for at least 6 months, (5) depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) injections for at least 6 months, (6)  IUD for at least 1 month. Glycomic profiling was obtained using our lectin microarray system, a rapid method to analyze carbohydrate composition. Although some small effects were observed due to hormone levels, the major influence on the glycome was the presence of an altered bacterial cohort due to bacterial vaginosis (BV). Compared to normal women, samples from women with BV contained lower levels of sialic acid and high-mannose glycans in their CVL. The change in high mannose levels was unexpected and may be related to the increased risk of HIV-infection observed in women with BV, as high mannose receptors are a viral entry pathway. Changes in the glycome were also observed with hormonal contraceptive use, in a contraceptive-dependent manner. Overall, microflora had a greater impact on the glycome than hormonal levels, and both of these effects should be more closely examined in future studies given the importance of glycans in the innate immune system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27556454>The Effects of Female Sexual Hormones on the Expression of Aquaporin 5 in the Late-Pregnant Rat Uterus.</a></h2><p>Thirteen mammalian aquaporin (AQP) water channels are known, and few of them play a role in the mammalian reproductive system. In our earlier study, the predominance of AQP5 in the late-pregnant rat uterus was proven. Our current aim was to investigate the effect of estrogen- and gestagen-related compounds on the expression of the AQP5 channel in the late-pregnant rat uterus. Furthermore, we examined the effect of hormonally-induced preterm delivery on the expression of AQP5 in the uterus. We treated pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats subcutaneously with 17β-estradiol, clomiphene citrate, tamoxifen citrate, progesterone, , and medroxyprogesterone acetate. Preterm delivery was induced by subcutaneous mifepristone and intravaginal prostaglandin E2. Reverse-transcriptase PCR and Western blot techniques were used for the detection of the changes in AQP5 mRNA and protein expressions. The amount of AQP5 significantly increased after progesterone and progesterone analogs treatment on 18 and 22 days of pregnancy. The 17β-estradiol and estrogen receptor agonists did not influence the AQP5 mRNA level; however, estradiol induced a significant increase in the AQP5 protein level on the investigated days of gestation. Tamoxifen increased the AQP5 protein expression on day 18, while clomiphene citrate was ineffective. The hormonally-induced preterm birth significantly decreased the AQP5 level similarly to the day of delivery. We proved that AQP5 expression is influenced by both estrogen and progesterone in the late-pregnant rat uterus. The influence of progesterone on AQP5 expression is more predominant as compared with estrogen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29359457>The -releasing intrauterine system is associated with a reduction in dysmenorrhoea and dyspareunia, a decrease in CA 125 levels, and an increase in quality of life in women with suspected endometriosis.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a -releasing intrauterine device (LNG-IUS) in the symptomatic relief of pain in women with endometriosis and additionally, to assess the changes in women's life quality and serum cancer antigen (CA) 125 levels.All women who had an LNG-IUS inserted for the treatment of dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain or both for more than six months over a two-year period were included in the study.

Identification of a simple, less expensive measure of systemic ethinyl estradiol exposure would be useful for larger studies that are designed to assess the relationship between an individual's ethinyl estradiol exposure and side-effects.We collected 13 samples over 24 hours for pharmacokinetic analysis on days 1 and 21 of the first cycle of a monophasic oral contraceptive that contained 30 μg ethinyl estradiol and 150 μg  in 17 nonobese healthy white women. We also conducted an abbreviated single-dose 9-sample pharmacokinetic analysis after a month washout. Ethinyl estradiol was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We compared results of a full 13-sample steady-state pharmacokinetic analysis with results that had been calculated with the use of fewer samples (9 or 5) and after the single doses. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients to evaluate the relationships between these estimates of systemic ethinyl estradiol exposure.The AUC, maximum, and 24-hour values were similar after the 2 single oral contraceptive doses (AUC; r=0.92). The steady-state 13-sample 24-hour AUC value was correlated highly with the average 9-sample AUC value after the 2 single doses (r=0.81; P=.0002). This correlation remained the same if the number of single-dose samples was reduced to 4, taken at time 1, 2.5, 4, and 24 hours. The 24-hour value at steady-state was correlated highly with the 24-hour steady-state AUC value (r=0.92; P<.0001). The average of the 24-hour values after the 2 single doses was also correlated quite highly with the steady-state AUC value (r=0.72; P=.0026).Limited blood sampling, including results from 2 single doses, gave highly correlated estimates of an oral contraceptive user's steady-state ethinyl estradiol exposure.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

There was no ring or pill free week. After every 28 days, pain relief was measured using visual analogue scale (VAS), and verbal rating score (VRS) calculated by summing dysmenorrhea, non-cyclic pelvic pain (NCCP) and deep dyspareunia scores. Side effects, compliance, satisfaction, and user acceptability were also measured. Data was analyzed using various parametric and non-parametric tests.Reduction in mean VAS score at end of treatment in ring group was 6.23 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.45-7.01; p<0.001) as compared to 5.53 in pill group (95% CI, 4.83-6.23; p<0.001). Reduction in mean VRS score was 5.63 in ring users (95% CI, 4.84-6.42; p<0.001) versus 4.36 in pill users (95% CI, 3.63-5.10; p<0.001). A significantly higher persistent relief in NCPP score was observed in vaginal ring group as compared to oral pill group at end of one month after stopping treatment. Compliance, satisfaction, and user acceptability were higher in ring users (80%) than pill users (70%) and a higher incidence of nausea was seen in pill group.Present study demonstrates for first time that both vaginal and oral hormonal therapy are effective in treatment of idiopathic chronic pelvic pain and vaginal ring may be a better choice with higher satisfaction rate and fewer side effects.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the differential impact of four oral or transdermal progestins on the suppression of gonadotropins in healthy men: oral: cyproterone acetate (CPA),  (LNG), norethisterone acetate (NETA), and transdermal: Nestorone (NES), all in combination with transdermal testosterone (T). Randomized clinical trial testing was performed with four progestins at two doses each. After a 2-week progestin-only treatment, transdermal T was added for further 4 weeks and was followed by a 3-week recovery period. Progestin-dose per day: CPA 10 mg/20 mg, NES 2 mg/3 mg/dose e.g. 200/300 μg/day absorbed, NETA 5 mg/10 mg, LNG 120 μg/240 μg. From an andrology outpatient clinic, 56 healthy men aged 18-50 years, with body mass index ≤33 kg × m were included in the study. Serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were studied. Secondary outcome measure included were serum testosterone concentrations, sperm concentrations, and safety parameters. Intergroup comparisons demonstrated that CPA and LNG had the strongest effect on LH/FSH suppression. Nevertheless, every substance showed significant inhibitory effects on gonadotropin secretion, especially in combination with transdermal T. A decrease in hematocrit and insulin sensitivity as well as cholesterol subfractions and triglycerides was uniformly seen for every group. The combination of oral or transdermal progestins with a transdermal testosterone preparation is able to suppress gonadotropins. Further dose titration studies with sperm suppression as an end-point should be conducted to determine the lowest effective dose for hormonal male contraception.© 2017 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29198449>Effects of Flibanserin on the Pharmacokinetics of a Combined Ethinylestradiol/ Oral Contraceptive in Healthy Premenopausal Women: A Randomized Crossover Study.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate the effect of steady-state exposure to flibanserin, a 5-HT agonist/5-HT antagonist approved for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in premenopausal women, on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of the contraceptive steroids ethinylestradiol and  in healthy premenopausal women.Healthy female volunteers (N = 24) received 2 single doses of a combined oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol 30 μg and  150 μg, either alone (reference) or preceded by treatment with flibanserin 100 mg once daily for 14 days (test). The 2 treatments were given in randomized order, with a 4-week washout period following the last administration of the first treatment. Plasma concentrations of ethinylestradiol and  were measured over 48 hours after dosing for the determination of pharmacokinetic parameters; the primary end points were C and AUC of ethinylestradiol and .Of the 24 women enrolled (mean age, 38.0 years), 23 completed the study. Mean (SD) C and AUC values of ethinylestradiol were 66.7 (16.3) pg/mL and 693 (268) pg · h/mL, respectively, following the oral contraceptive alone, and 72.7 (25.5) pg/mL and 740 (235) pg · h/mL, respectively, when the oral contraceptive was preceded by flibanserin. In both cases, the 90% CIs of the reference/test ratios of C and AUC were within the range of 80% to 125%, indicating that flibanserin had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethinylestradiol. Similarly, the mean (SD) C and AUC values of  were 5.0 (1.6) ng/mL and 52.2 (18.7) ng · h/mL, respectively, with the oral contraceptive alone, and 5.0 (1.6) ng/mL and 53.3 (20.4) ng · h/mL, respectively, following flibanserin; again, in both cases, the 90% CIs of the reference/test ratios were within the range of 80% to 125%, indicating that flibanserin had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of . All adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity (incidence: 12.5% and 70.8% with ethinylestradiol/ treatment alone and following administration of flibanserin, respectively).Pretreatment with flibanserin 100 mg once daily for 2 weeks did not produce a clinically relevant change in oral contraceptive drug exposure following single-dose administration of ethinylestradiol/. This finding is relevant to women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder who might prefer oral contraceptives to other forms of birth control. EudraCT No: 2006-006960-46.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

The different pharmacological composition of EPs is responsible for different clinical effects. One of the most used low-dose EP associations is ethinylestradiol 20 mcg plus  100 mcg in monophasic regimen (EE20/LNG100). This review summarizes clinical pharmacology, cycle control, and effects on lipid and glucose , coagulation, body weight/body composition, acne, and sexuality of EE20/LNG100. Overall, EE20/LNG100 combination is safe and well tolerated, and in several studies the incidence of adverse events in the treated group was comparable to that of the placebo group. Cycle control was effective and body weight/body composition did not vary among treated and untreated groups in most studies. The EE20/LNG100 combination shows mild or no effect on lipid and glucose . Lastly, EE20/LNG100 is associated with a low risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). In conclusion, in the process of decision making for the individualization of EPs choice, EE20/LNG100 should be considered for its favorable clinical profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29246819>Discordance between self-reported contraceptive use and detection of exogenous hormones among Malawian women enrolling in a randomized clinical trial.</a></h2><p>The objective was to assess the extent of concordance between self-reported contraceptive use and the presence of contraceptive progestins in serum.We evaluated self-reported contraceptive use by using radioimmunoassay to examine baseline serum levels of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and  (LNG) among 97 Malawian women enrolling in a contraceptive trial.Twelve percent (12/97) of study participants who reported no hormonal contraceptive use in the previous 6months had either MPA or LNG detected in their serum.The observed discordance between self-report and detection of exogenous hormones in serum indicates that caution is warranted when drawing conclusions based on self-reported contraceptive use.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28427775>Nonoperative management of atypical endometrial hyperplasia and grade 1 endometrial cancer with the  intrauterine device in medically ill post-menopausal women.</a></h2><p>To assess the endometrial response rates to treatment with the  intrauterine device in post-menopausal women with atypical hyperplasia/endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia and grade 1 endometrioid (AH/EC) endometrial carcinoma who are not surgical candidates.Chart review was undertaken of patients with AH/EC who underwent  intrauterine device insertion by a gynecologic oncologist within two academic health systems between 2002 and 2013. When available, tissue blocks were evaluated with immunohistochemical staining for progesterone receptor expression.A total of 41 patients received treatment for AH/EC with the  intrauterine device. Follow up sufficient to assess response occurred in 36 women (88%). Complete response was documented in 18 of 36 women (50%), no response in 8 patients (22%), partial response in 3 women (8%) and progression of disease in 7 patients (19%). Four of 18 patients with complete response (22%) later experienced relapse of hyperplasia or cancer. Four patients (10%) died during the study period: none had evidence of metastatic disease and 1 of the 4 woman died of perioperative complications following hysterectomy for stage I disease. Patients responding to treatment had significantly lower progesterone receptor expression on post-treatment biopsies.Intrauterine  is a viable treatment option for post-menopausal women with AH/EC who are poor candidates for standard surgical management. The response rate in this series is similar to published reports in premenopausal patients and includes cases of disease recurrence following conversion to benign endometrium.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The mechanism is preventing or delaying ovulation at the level of the hypothalamic pituitary unit; however, little knowledge exists on LNG effects at the ovary. The aim of this study was to identify the effects of LNG on FSH-induced 17β-estradiol (E) production, including LNG-mediated changes on global gene expression in rat granulosa cells (GC). Isolated GC from female Wistar rats were incubated in vitro in the presence or absence of human FSH and progestins. At the end of incubations, culture media and cells were collected for E and mRNA quantitation. The results showed the ability of LNG to inhibit both hFSH-induced E production and aromatase gene expression. Microarray analysis revealed that LNG treatment affects GC functionality particularly that related to folliculogenesis and steroid . These results may offer additional evidence for the mechanisms of action of LNG as EC.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In the present study, we show that the components of oral contraceptives, ethinylestradiol (EE),  (LNG), and their combination (EE + LNG) ± UVB (ultraviolet B radiation) induced differential effects on healthy (human keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and primary epidermal melanocytes, and murine epidermis cells) and melanoma cells (human-A375 and murine-B164A5), as follows: (i) at low doses (1 µM), the hormones were devoid of significant toxicity on healthy cells, but in melanoma cells, they triggered cell death via apoptosis; (ii) higher doses (10 µM) were associated with cytotoxicity in all cells, the most affected being the melanoma cells; (iii) UVB irradiation proved to be toxic for all types of cells; (iv) UVB irradiation + hormonal stimulation led to a synergistic cytotoxicity in the case of human melanoma cells-A375 and improved viability rates of healthy and B164A5 cells. A weak irritant potential exerted by EE and EE + LNG (10 µM) was assessed by the means of a chick chorioallantoic membrane assay.

Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), is the usual first choice of treatment in women with PCOS. Because OCP use has been linked to the risk of venous thrombosis and there are limited data on the effect of OCP use on the inflammatory state of women with PCOS, our objective was to compare the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 between drug-naive and OCP-treated women with PCOS. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Consequent to women diagnosed with PCOS on the basis of Rotterdam 2003 criteria, either treated with OCPs (ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg, levonogestrel-0.15 mg) for a period of 6 months (n = 50) or drug-naive (n = 51) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study.The mean ages of patients and control participants were comparable (21.99 ± 4.78 vs 21.92 ± 5.83 years; P = .947) as was body mass index (24.47 ± 3.92 vs 23.66 ± 3.43; P = .271). Clinical and androgen excess symptoms were significantly better in the OCP group compared with the drug-naive group (P = .01, P = .04). Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly higher in the OCP group (P = .01). Plasma ICAM-1 levels, TNF-α levels, and MCP-1 levels showed a higher trend in patients but reached statistical significance only in cases of ICAM-1 and TNF-α (P = .01).OCP treatment of 6 months increases plasma ICAM-1, MCP-1, and TNF-α levels among women with PCOS, although OCPs significantly help in ameliorating features of hyperandrogenism and regularizing menstrual cycles. These cytokines correlate positively with many  parameters including plasma glucose, lipids, and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance. Further investigation with well designed, randomized, longitudinal studies might help to ascertain the effect of OCPs on proinflammatory profiles among women with PCOS.Copyright © 2016 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.

As the combination oral contraceptive (COC) /ethinyl estradiol (LNG/EE) may be coadministered in this target transplant population, the effects of letermovir on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LNG and EE were investigated.This was a phase I, open-label, fixed-sequence, two-period study conducted in healthy women (18 - 65 years old) of non-childbearing potential (protocol number: MK-8228 035). On day 1 of period 1, participants received a single dose of COC (LNG 0.15 mg/EE 0.03 mg). Following a 7-day washout, oral letermovir 480 mg was administered once-daily on days 1 - 12 of period 2, with a single dose of COC coadministered on day 8. Blood samples were collected to determine LNG and EE PK, and safety was assessed.The AUC geometric mean ratios (90% confidence intervals) for COC + letermovir/COC alone were 1.36 (1.30, 1.43) for LNG and 1.42 (1.32, 1.52) for EE, indicating that letermovir coadministration increased COC exposure. Coadministration had no clinically-meaningful effect on C, t, or apparent terminal T for either LNG or EE. All treatments were generally well tolerated.Letermovir coadministration with COC resulted in an increase in LNG and EE exposure in healthy adult women; however, levels were within the established safety margins. There was no decrease in LNG or EE exposure with no apparent risk of contraceptive failure on coadministration of letermovir and COC. .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25459097>Sino-implant (II)® continuation and effect of concomitant tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine use on plasma  concentrations among women in Bondo, Kenya.</a></h2><p>The objective was to assess associations between tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine (TDF-FTC) exposure and  (LNG) concentrations among Kenyan HIV prevention trial participants using Sino-implant (II) LNG implants for contraception.Women were offered implants among other contraceptive methods, were randomized to daily TDF-FTC or placebo, and followed monthly up to 56weeks.

A new ECP formulation, ulipristal acetate (UPA), is now available worldwide. To determine whether LNG, UPA or COC (Yuzpe) ECPs are safe for women with certain characteristics or medical conditions, we searched the PubMed and Cochrane databases for articles published from date of inception until May 2015 pertaining to the safety of LNG, UPA or Yuzpe ECP use. For direct evidence, we considered studies that looked at safety outcomes among women with certain medical conditions or characteristics taking ECPs compared with women not taking ECPs. For indirect evidence, we considered studies that reported pharmacokinetic (PK) data for ECP use among women with certain medical conditions or characteristics and studies that reported safety outcomes among healthy women taking ECPs. Five studies provided direct evidence; of these five studies, four examined LNG or Yuzpe use among pregnant or breastfeeding women, and one reported risk of ectopic pregnancy among women repeatedly using LNG ECPs. Poor pregnancy outcomes were rare among pregnant women who used LNG or Yuzpe ECPs during the conception cycle or early pregnancy. Breastfeeding outcomes did not differ between women exposed to LNG ECP and those unexposed, and there was no increased risk of ectopic pregnancy versus intrauterine pregnancy after repeated use of LNG ECPs compared with nonuse. Forty-five studies provided indirect evidence. One PK study demonstrated that LNG passes into breastmilk but in minimal quantities. In addition, nine studies examined pregnancy outcomes following ECP failure among healthy women, and 35 articles reported adverse events. Studies suggest that serious adverse events are rare among women taking any of these ECP formulations.Evidence on safety of ECPs among women with characteristics or medical conditions listed within WHO and CDC family planning guidance is limited. However, both direct and indirect evidence for our study question did not suggest any special safety concerns for the use of ECPs among women with particular medical conditions or personal characteristics, such as pregnancy, lactation or frequent ECP use.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28609592>Perimenopausal contraception: A practice-based approach.</a></h2><p>Women who are perimenopausal are at risk of unintended pregnancy despite relatively low fertility at this stage.

In this parallel-group, randomized, open-label study, healthy premenopausal women received an IVR as the main treatment. Comedications were administered on 3 consecutive evenings during treatment with IVR on days 9-11 (group A, 400 mg miconazole; group B, 100 mg clindamycin; group C, 75 mg nonoxynol-9); tampon co-usage (group D) was performed on days 20-23. The primary PK parameter was the average plasma concentration (C ) of ATZ and LNG at defined intervals, mainly prior to, during, and up to 7 days after the start of comedication. Fifty-two subjects were included, and at least 11 subjects per group completed the treatments. Overall, the medications and comedications were safe and well tolerated. Very similar ATZ and LNG plasma levels were observed across all groups. The calculated ratios of C confirmed the absence of PK interactions because all relevant point estimates and 90% confidence intervals were within the range of 0.800-1.250, which is typically used in bioequivalence studies. These results demonstrate the absence of PK interactions between ATZ/LNG released from IVR and the tested antibiotic, antimycotic, spermicide, and tampons. Therefore, no restrictions for the use of the IVR are needed to continue the clinical program intended to treat endometriosis symptoms.© 2017, The Authors.

Hormonal contraceptives may modify the genital mucosa in several ways, however the mechanisms are incompletely understood. Few studies have examined genital HIV shedding prospectively before and after initiation of hormonal contraception. The effects of hormonal contraception on genital HIV shedding in the setting of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are also unknown. We designed a pilot clinical trial in which HIV-infected and uninfected women were randomized to either depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) injectable or  (LNG) implant in Lilongwe, Malawi. The objectives were to: 1) assess the effect and compare the impact of type of progestin contraception (injectable versus implant) on HIV genital shedding among HIV-infected women, 2) assess the effect and compare the impact of type of progestin contraception on inflammatory/immune markers in the genital tract of both HIV-infected and uninfected women, and 3) assess the interaction of progestin contraception and ART by examining contraceptive efficacy and ART efficacy. An additional study aim was to determine the feasibility and need for a larger study of determinants of HIV transmissibility and acquisition. As injectable contraception is widely used in many parts of the world with high HIV prevalence, this study will provide important information in determining the need for and feasibility of a larger study to address these questions that can impact the lives of millions of women living with or at risk for HIV.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28041992>Changes in body composition in women using long-acting reversible contraception.</a></h2><p>Users of hormonal long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) report weight gain as a side effect, but few studies have assessed body composition change among LARC users.

It decreases the blood loss due to haemostatic effect of estrogen and also regularizes the cycle. Intravaginal route has been found to be effective and acceptable; Gastrointestinal absorption and hepatic first-pass  is avoided and steady, uniform blood concentration is achieved. Bioavailability of estrogen and progestogen through oral and vaginal route are same. The convenience of once-a-month administration is another major advantage.Sixty women fulfilling inclusion criteria were randomised into 2 groups in 1:1 ratio. In one group (n=30), monthly insertion of Nuvaring(®)) was done for three consecutive months. Nuvaring(®) releases 15μg ethinyl estradiol and 120 μg etonogesterol daily. The other group (n=30) received COC pill containing 30μg EE and 150 μg  for three consecutive months. Primary outcome measures were change in menstrual cycle pattern and pictorial Blood Loss Assessment chart (PBAC) score. Other Parameters included side effects, change in haemoglobin and weight. Data was analyzed by statistical software SPSS 20.Both Nuvaring(®) and COC were found to significantly decrease blood loss in each cycle. Decrease in PBAC score was more in Nuvaring(®) group compared to COC, however difference was not significant. Ideal bleed (IB) was frequently higher for Nuvaring(®) group than COC in all 3 cycles, although no statistically significant difference was observed between groups (p-value=0.286). Late withdrawl, intermenstural spotting was higher in COC group. Compliance was better and women were more satisfied in Nuvaring(®) group compared to COC group. Minor side effects like headache, mastalgia, nausea and mood changes were seen in both groups, which were not significant. Continuation rate was significantly higher in Nuvaring® group. 30% women discontinued treatment in OCP group after 3 month compare to 10% in Nuvaring(®) group.Present study shows Nuvaring(®) to be as effective as COC in controlling heavy menstural bleed, better cycle control, with minor acceptable systemic side effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25895986>CCR5 Expression Levels in HIV-Uninfected Women Receiving Hormonal Contraception.</a></h2><p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infectivity increases as receptor/coreceptor expression levels increase. We determined peripheral CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 expression levels in HIV-uninfected women who used depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA; n = 32), the -releasing intrauterine device (LNG-IUD; n = 27), oral contraceptive pills (n = 32), or no hormonal contraception (n = 33). The use of LNG-IUD increased the proportion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells that expressed CCR5; increases in the magnitude of T-cell subset CCR5 expression were observed with DMPA and LNG-IUD use (P < .01 for all comparisons). LNG-IUD and, to a lesser extent, DMPA use were associated with increased peripheral T-cell CCR5 expression.© The Author 2015.

We present safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, acceptability and drug release data in healthy women. CONRAD A13-128 was a randomized, placebo controlled phase I study. We screened 86 women; 51 were randomized to TFV, TFV/LNG or placebo IVR [2:2:1] and 50 completed all visits, using the IVR for approximately 15 days. We assessed safety by adverse events, colposcopy, vaginal microbiota, epithelial integrity, mucosal histology and immune cell numbers and phenotype, cervicovaginal [CV] cytokines and antimicrobial proteins and changes in systemic laboratory measurements, and LNG and TFV pharmacokinetics in multiple compartments. TFV pharmacodynamic activity was measured by evaluating CV fluid [CVF] and tissue for antiviral activity using in vitro models. LNG pharmacodynamic assessments were timed based on peak urinary luteinizing hormone levels. All IVRs were safe with no significant colposcopic, mucosal, immune and microbiota changes and were acceptable. Among TFV containing IVR users, median and mean CV aspirate TFV concentrations remained above 100,000 ng/mL 4 hours post IVR insertion and mean TFV-diphosphate [DP] concentrations in vaginal tissue remained above 1,000 fmol/mg even 3 days post IVR removal. CVF of women using TFV-containing IVRs completely inhibited [94-100%] HIV infection in vitro. TFV/LNG IVR users had mean serum LNG concentrations exceeding 300 pg/mL within 1 hour, remaining high throughout IVR use. All LNG IVR users had a cervical mucus Insler score <10 and the majority [95%] were anovulatory or had abnormal cervical mucus sperm penetration. Estimated in vivo TFV and LNG release rates were within expected ranges. All IVRs were safe with the active ones delivering sustained high concentrations of TFV locally. LNG caused changes in cervical mucus, sperm penetration, and ovulation compatible with contraceptive efficacy. The TFV and TFV/LNG rings are ready for expanded 90 day clinical testing.

The first visit entailed a blood draw, uterine lavage and endometrial biopsy followed by LNG-IUS insertion. Follow-up visit involved a repeat serum draw, uterine lavage and endometrial biopsy. Cytokine levels were measured in the uterine lavage and serum by quantifying inflammatory biomarkers. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed on the endometrial tissue to measure macrophage levels. Statistical analysis included a nonparametric analysis that compared medians of the marker levels before and after intrauterine device (IUD) insertion within the group and between the two groups.Sixteen participants completed the study: 5 solid organ transplant patients and 11 healthy patients. For the serum, there were no marked changes in the cytokines or soluble receptor levels in either group after IUD insertion. However, in the uterine lavage, there was an increase in cytokine levels post-IUD insertion for both healthy and transplant women. For the endometrial tissue, there was evidence of macrophage activity in both groups after device insertion.This pilot study investigated the uterine environment of the transplant patient population. Findings have pointed to the strong local inflammatory response following LNG-IUS insertion for the transplant recipients. In addition, these preliminary findings will help power a larger study that can investigate the safety and effectiveness of the IUD in this patient population.Findings from this pilot study suggest that the IUD is inducing a local inflammatory reaction in the uterus of the transplant patient as in the healthy control. A larger study can build on these preliminary results to pursue the efficacy and safety of IUD use among solid organ transplant patients.Copyright © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

LNG pharmacokinetics are a pivotal determinant of contraceptive efficacy and essential in assessing drug-drug interactions influencing LNG exposure following different routes of LNG administration. A highly sensitive LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated to quantify  in human plasma. Liquid-liquid extraction was utilized with a sample volume of 500 μL to extract  from plasma. Chromatographic separation of LNG was achieved with a Fortis™ C18 (3 μm: 100 mm × 2.1 mm) reverse phase analytical column. The mobile phases consisted of de-ionized water plus 0.1% NHOH (100:0.1%, v/v) (A), and methanol plus 0.1% NHOH (100:0.1%, v/v) (B) delivered as a gradient at a flow rate of 400 μL/min.

We randomly selected samples within 90-day intervals after discontinuation of IUS use through 900days (approximately 2.5years) and 180-day intervals for the remaining duration through 5.4years (1980days) to evaluate residual LNG content. We also performed an initial LNG content analysis using 10 randomly selected samples from a single lot. We calculated the average ex vivo release rate using the residual LNG content over the duration of the analysis.We analyzed 64 samples within 90-day intervals (range 6-10 samples per interval) through 900days and 36 samples within 180-day intervals (6 samples per interval) for the remaining duration. The initial content analysis averaged 52.0±1.8mg. We calculated an average initial release rate of 19.5mcg/day that decreased to 17.0, 14.8, 12.9, 11.3 and 9.8mcg/day after 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5years, respectively. The 5-year average release rate is 14.7mcg/day.The estimated initial LNG release rate and gradual decay of the estimated release rate are consistent with the target design and function of the product. The calculated LNG content and release rate curves support the continued evaluation of Liletta as a contraceptive for 5 or more years of use.Liletta LNG content and release rates are comparable to published data for another LNG 52-mg IUS.

For three consecutive cycles in a 24/4-day regimen, participants received 5 mg or 10 mg E4/3 mg drospirenone (DRSP); 5 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg E4/150 μg ; or 20 μg ethinylestradiol (EE)/3 mg DRSP as comparator. Pituitary-ovarian axis activity and the occurrence of ovulation were evaluated by monitoring follicular size, serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinising hormone, estradiol and progesterone during treatment cycles 1 and 3. Endometrial thickness was evaluated throughout the trial, and the return of ovulation was evaluated after the last intake of medication.A total of 109 women were included in the trial. No ovulation occurred in any treatment group. Ovarian activity inhibition seemed proportional to the E4 dosage: the highest suppression was observed in the 20 mg E4 group and was very similar to that observed with EE/DRSP. Endometrial thickness was suppressed to the same extent in all groups. Post-treatment ovulation occurred in all participants between 17 and 21 days after the last active treatment.

Studies published since 1990 showed that third-generation progestins have larger risk to contribute to thrombosis development than the second-generation. However, there are conflicts in the literature regarding the thrombotic risk associated to the drospirenone progestin. So, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of 3 formulations of contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (EE) (20 and 30 μg) combined with drospirenone versus  combined with EE (30 μg) in hemostatic parameters. This cross-sectional study included 70 healthy women between 18 and 30 years, BMI 19 to 30 kg/m², not pregnant, non-smokers, and users or non-users (control) of contraceptives for a minimum period of 6 months. The following parameters were assessed: prothrombin time (PT), Factor VII, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), Factor XII, fibrinogen, Factor 1 + 2, Protein C, Protein S, antithrombin, D-dimers, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Significant alterations were found in PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, D-dimers, and protein S, all favoring a state of hypercoagulation for contraceptive containing DRSP/20EE. Both contraceptives containing DRSP/30EE and LNG/30EE promoted changes that favor the hypercoagulability in the coagulant variable PT and in the anticoagulant variables Protein S and Protein C, respectively. We suggest that the progestin drospirenone can contribute to an inadequate balance among procoagulant, anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic factors, since that the contraceptive containing the lowest dose of estrogen and drospirenone (DRSP/20EE) caused a higher number of hemostatic changes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26341277>Low-dose progestin-releasing contraceptives are associated with a higher pain threshold in healthy women.</a></h2><p>To determine the pain thresholds of women taking different formulations of hormonal contraceptives.Cross-sectional study.Basic health care unit.Eighty-nine healthy nonusers and 188 users of hormonal contraceptives.Subject interviews were followed by the application of a semistructured questionnaire, including a psychometric assessment with the Beck Depression Inventory and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.

These hormonal changes cause increased proliferation, inflammation, pain and infertility. Hormonal imbalances are targets for treatment. Therapeutic strategies and innovations of hormonal drugs for endometriosis are increasing. Acting on estrogen receptors are hormonal drugs decreasing systemic and local estrogen synthesis (GnRH analogs, GnRH antagonists, Aromatase inhibitors) or estrogen activity (selective estrogen receptor modulators). The progesterone resistance is counteracted by progestins (Medroxyprogesterone acetate, Dienogest, Danazol, ) or by Selective progesterone receptor modulators, a class of drugs under development.

However, the concomitant effects of COC and NO deficiency on the heart and glucose regulation are not well known. We therefore hypothesized that COC treatment during NO deficiency would lead to the development of cardiac hypertrophy that is associated with aggravated glucose deregulation, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic biomarkers. Eight-week-old female Wistar rats were randomly allotted into control, NO deficient (N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester: L-NAME; 20.0mg/kg b.w.), COC-treated (1.0μg ethinylestradiol+5.0μg , p.o) and L-NAME+COC-treated groups. The animals were treated daily for 6 weeks. Systolic blood pressure was estimated by tail-cuff plethysmography, insulin resistance (IR) and β-cell function were estimated by homeostatic model of assessment (HOMA-IR and HOMA-β). Pro-inflammatory (C-reactive protein; CRP and uric acid) and pro-fibrotic (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; PAI-1) biomarkers were estimated in the plasma. Cardiac histological examination was also done. Results show that COC or L-NAME treatments led to increased blood pressure, HOMA-IR, impaired β-cell function, PAI-1, CRP and uric acid, without significant effect on cardiac mass. L-NAME+COC-treated group had significantly higher blood pressure, HOMA-IR, impaired β-cell function, PAI-1, CRP and cardiac mass than COC- or L-NAME-treated groups. Histological examination validated that COC use during NO deficiency causes cardiac hypertrophy.

This regimen allows for a reduction in the number of withdrawal bleeding episodes to four per year, compared with 13 episodes per year with conventional 28-day regimens. Seasonique(®) was effective in preventing pregnancy in a large (n = 1006), noncomparative trial of healthy, sexually active women. In this trial, the overall Pearl index (pregnancies per 100 woman-years of use) in women aged 18-35 years (n = 621) was 0.76 and the Pearl index for method-failure (compliant use) was 0.26. Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with a mean of 2 days of bleeding and 1 day of spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting was highest during the first few cycles of use and decreased thereafter. Seasonique(®) was generally well tolerated, with a tolerability profile in line with that expected for OCs. Seasonique(®) extends the contraceptive options currently available to women, particularly in those who desire fewer withdrawal bleeding episodes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27591655>Development of a microfluidic-chip system for liquid-phase microextraction based on two immiscible organic solvents for the extraction and preconcentration of some hormonal drugs.</a></h2><p>In the present study, for the first time, an on-chip liquid phase microextraction (LPME) coupled with high performance liquid chromatography was introduced for the analysis of  (Levo), dydrogesterone (Dydo) and medroxyprogesterone (Medo) as the model analytes in biological samples. The chip-based LPME set-up was composed of two polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) plates with microfabricated channels and a microporous membrane sandwiched between them to separate the sample solution and acceptor phase. These channels were used as a flow path for the sample solution and a thin compartment for the acceptor phase, respectively. In this system, two immiscible organic solvents were used as supported liquid membrane (SLM) and acceptor phase, respectively. During extraction, the model analytes in the sample solution were transported through the SLM (n-dodecane) into the acceptor organic solvent (methanol). The new set-up provided effective and reproducible extractions using low volumes of the sample solution. The effective parameters on the extraction efficiency of the model analytes were optimized using one variable at a time method. Under the optimized conditions, the new set-up provided good linearity in the range of 5.0-500µgL(-1) for the model analytes with the coefficients of determination (r(2)) higher than 0.9909. The relative standard deviations (RSDs%) and limits of detection (LODs) values were less than 6.5% (n=5) and 5.0µgL(-1), respectively. The preconcentration factors (PFs) were obtained using 1.0mL of the sample solution and 20.0µL of the acceptor solution higher than 19.9-fold. Finally, the proposed method was successfully applied for the extraction and determination of the model analytes in urine samples.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We conducted this study to assess whether limited sampling at steady state or measurements following use of one or two OCs could provide an adequate proxy in epidemiological studies for the progestin 24-h steady-state AUC of a particular OC.We conducted a 13-sample, 24-h pharmacokinetic study on both day 1 and day 21 of the first cycle of a monophasic OC containing 30-mcg ethinyl estradiol and 150-mcg  (LNG) in 17 normal-weight healthy White women and a single-dose 9-sample study of the same OC after a 1-month washout. We compared the 13-sample steady-state results with several steady-state and single-dose results calculated using parsimonious sampling schemes.The 13-sample steady-state 24-h LNG AUC was highly correlated with the steady-state 24-h trough value [r=0.95; 95% confidence interval (0.85, 0.98)] and with the steady-state 6-, 8-, 12- and 16-h values (0.92≤r≤0.95). The trough values after one or two doses were moderately correlated with the steady-state 24-h AUC value [r=0.70; 95% CI (0.27, 0.90) and 0.77; 95% CI (0.40, 0.92), respectively].Single time-point concentrations at steady state and after administration of one or two OCs gave highly to moderately correlated estimates of steady-state LNG AUC. Using such measures could facilitate prospective pharmaco-epidemiologic studies of the OC and its side effects.A single time-point LNG concentration at steady state is an excellent proxy for complete and resource-intensive steady-state AUC measurement. The trough level after two single doses is a fair proxy for steady-state AUC. These results provide practical tools to facilitate large studies to investigate the relationship between systemic LNG exposure and side effects in a real-life setting.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Healthy, reproductive-aged women (n=146) were randomized to one of three groups for three consecutive 28-day cycles, as follows: treatment 1 (n=39 completed): 21/7-active COC [21 days of 150 mcg desogestrel (DSG)/20 mcg EE, followed by 7 days of 10 mcg EE (DSG/EE+7 days EE)], treatment 2 (n=39 completed): 24 days of 3mg drospirenone (DRSP)/20 mcg EE, followed by 4 placebo (PBO)-pill days (DRSP/EE+4 days PBO) and treatment 3 (n=42 completed): 21 days of 100 mcg  (LNG)/20 mcg EE, followed by 7 PBO-pill days (LNG/EE+7 days PBO). The primary outcome was ovarian activity suppression assessed by transvaginal ultrasound and serum hormone concentrations and classified using the Hoogland and Skouby (H/S) method.Ovarian activity rate (H/S grade 4 or 5) was low for all three treatments: 0% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0-2.8] for DSG/EE+7 days EE, 1% (95% CI 0.2-5.2) for DRSP/EE+4days PBO and 1% (95% CI 0-3.9) for LNG/EE+7 days PBO. All three treatments showed similar suppression of serum progesterone, 17β-estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels.The 21/7-active low-dose COC regimen (DSG/EE+7 days EE) showed ovarian activity suppression that was similar to the 24/4 (DRSP/EE+4 days PBO) and 21/7 (LNG/EE+7days PBO) regimens.The 21/7-active low-dose COC regimen (DSG/EE+7 days EE) that included only EE during the traditional HFI showed suppression of ovarian follicular activity that was similar to the 24/4 (DRSP/EE+4days PBO) and the 21/7 (LNG/EE+7 days PBO) comparator regimens.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Although mainly used for contraception, progestin can help treat menstrual disorders, and benign breast, uterine, and ovarian diseases. Breast cancer is the leading site of new, non-skin, cancers in females in the United States, and possible factors that may modulate breast cancer risk need to be identified. ProQuest (Ann Arbor, MI) and PubMed-Medline (US National Library of Medicine, Bethesda MD, USA) databases were used to search for epidemiologic studies from 2000 to 2015 that examined the association between progestin and breast cancer. Search terms included epidemiologic studies + progesterone or progestin or progestogen or contraceptive or contraceptive agents + breast cancer or breast neoplasms. A total of six studies were included in the review. Five of the six studies reported no association between progestin-only formulations (including norethindrone oral contraceptives, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, injectable,  system users, implantable and intrauterine devices) and breast cancer risk. Duration of use was examined in a few studies with heterogeneous results. Unlike studies of other oral contraceptives, studies indicate that progestin-only formulations do not increase the risk of breast cancer, although the literature is hampered by small sample sizes. Future research is needed to corroborate these findings, as further understanding of synthetic progesterone may initiate new prescription practices or guidelines for women's health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30395700>A further insight into the metabolic profile of the nuclear receptor Rev-erb agonist, SR9009.</a></h2><p>The reactions involved in the metabolic pathways of SR9009 were characterized by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to identify the most appropriate marker(s) of use. The effects of gender, genetic polymorphism, and drug-drug interaction on the metabolic profile of SR9009 were also evaluated. In vitro approaches were based on the use of human liver microsomes and cytochrome P450 isoforms. Sample preparation included an enzymatic hydrolysis (performed only for the phase II investigation) followed by liquid-liquid extraction. The chromatographic separation was carried out using a reverse-phase column; detection was performed by either a triple-quadrupole or a time-of-flight system in positive electrospray ionization and different acquisition modes. In the presence of human liver microsomes, SR9009 was biotransformed to 13 metabolites by CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 isoenzymes. The reactions included hydroxylation, de-alkylation, oxidation, and combinations thereof, the de-alkylated metabolites being the most abundant. Once formed the mentioned metabolites underwent glucuronidation. Concerning the effects of gender, genetic polymorphism, and drug-drug interaction on the metabolic profile of SR9009, our observation have shown the following: (a) No significant alterations were measured between female and male, (b) significant differences were registered using either the CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 allelic variants, and finally (c) significant alterations were registered in the presence of ketoconazole, miconazole, fluoxetine, nefazodone and paroxetine; moderate variation were instead registered with fluconazole, itraconazole, gestodene, and . This observation put in evidence the importance to take into account both genetic polymorphism and drug-drug interaction to select the most appropriate marker(s) of use in doping analysis.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28476823>Prediction of Relapse After Therapy Withdrawal in Women with Endometrial Hyperplasia: A Long-term Follow-up Study.</a></h2><p>To investigate whether risk of relapse of endometrial hyperplasia persists many years after successful primary therapy and whether clinical or biological markers observed at primary diagnosis may predict relapse.A series of 57 women with endometrial hyperplasia received -impregnated intrauterine system or oral progestin for three months during 1998-2000. Index biopsies were classified according to WHO1994 and D-score systems, and immunohistochemical staining for estrogen receptor α (ERα), estrogen receptor β (ERβ), progesterone receptor A (PRA), progesterone receptor B (PRB), B-cell lymphoma 2/apoptosis regulator (BCL2), BCL2-associated X protein/apoptosis regulator (BAX), paired box 2 (PAX2), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) reported as H-scores.Over a follow-up of 157.8 months, 23% (10/43) of patients experienced relapse. No correlation with age, body mass index, parity, WHO94 classification, or D-score was found. Only PRA (p=0.004) and PRB (p=0.038) showed certain correlation with relapse.Endometrial hyperplasia recurs many years after successful progestin therapy. Increased expression of PRB and reduced expression of PRA significantly correlated with relapse. Our results support the importance of continuous endometrial protection and the need for new clinical surveillance guidelines.Copyright© 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Here, we describe a novel core-matrix intravaginal ring (IVR), the MZCL IVR, which effectively delivered the MZC combination microbicide and a contraceptive. The MZCL IVR contains four active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs): MIV-150 (targets HIV-1), zinc acetate (ZA; targets HIV-1 and HSV-2), carrageenan (CG; targets HPV and HSV-2), and  (LNG; targets unintended pregnancy). The elastomeric IVR body (matrix) was produced by hot melt extrusion of the non-water swellable elastomer, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA-28), containing the hydrophobic small molecules, MIV-150 and LNG. The solid hydrophilic core, embedded within the IVR by compression, contained the small molecule ZA and the macromolecule CG. Hydrated ZA/CG from the core was released by diffusion via a pore on the IVR while the MIV-150/LNG diffused from the matrix continuously for 94 days (d) in vitro and up to 28 d (study period) in macaques. The APIs released in vitro and in vivo were active against HIV-1ADA-M, HSV-2, and HPV16 PsV in cell-based assays. Serum LNG was at levels associated with local contraceptive effects. The results demonstrate proof-of-concept of a novel core-matrix IVR for sustained and simultaneous delivery of diverse molecules for the prevention of HIV, HSV-2 and HPV acquisition, as well as unintended pregnancy.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

Fifty-five healthy women with normal ovulation at baseline were randomized to receive a low-dose (1500 μg/day) or a high-dose (2500 μg/day) UPA-CVR for two consecutive 12-week treatment periods, followed by a recovery cycle. A subgroup of women received  (LNG) 1.5 mg orally twice (at the end of both 12-week ring periods) or once (at the end of the 24-week treatment). The primary outcome was ovulation suppression assessed by transvaginal ultrasound and hormone levels. Secondary outcomes included endometrial safety and bleeding patterns.All subjects showed normal ovulation at baseline and recovery. Ovulation suppression was seen in 81.8% (95% CI: 73.3%, 88.5%) and 86.1% (95% CI: 78.1%, 92%) of treatment cycles with low and high-dose, respectively. Benign progesterone receptor modulator associated endometrial changes (PAEC) were seen during treatment; 78.8% at week 24, but resolved at recovery cycle. A few cases of heavy bleeding occurred near the end of the 24-week treatment, but a single dose of LNG every 12 weeks reduced the increase in endometrial thickness during the second treatment period and prevented excessive bleeding.The 3-month UPA-CVR may become an effective long-acting, user-controlled estrogen-free contraceptive. The greatest suppression of ovulation was seen with the 2500-μg/day ring.The 3-month CVR delivering UPA 2500 μg/day can become an effective user-controlled estrogen-free contraceptive method. Benign PAEC during treatment returns to normal after discontinuation. The prevention of occasional excessive withdrawal bleeding, either by a progestin or by using higher UPA levels to increase follicle suppression may permit prolonged treatment.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the joint exposure of aquatic wildlife to estrogens and progestins, very little information is available on their combined effects. In the present study we investigated the effect of ethinylestradiol (EE2) and  (LNG), alone and in mixtures, on the expression of the brain specific ER-regulated cyp19a1b gene. For that purpose, recently established zebrafish-derived tools were used: (i) an in vitro transient reporter gene assay in a human glial cell line (U251-MG) co-transfected with zebrafish estrogen receptors (zfERs) and the luciferase gene under the control of the zebrafish cyp19a1b gene promoter and (ii) an in vivo bioassay using a transgenic zebrafish expressing GFP under the control of the zebrafish cyp19a1b gene promoter (cyp19a1b-GFP). Concentration-response relationships for single chemicals were modeled and used to design the mixture experiments following a ray design. The results from mixture experiments were analyzed to predict joint effects according to concentration addition and statistical approaches were used to characterize the potential interactions between the components of the mixtures (synergism/antagonism). We confirmed that some progestins could elicit estrogenic effects in fish brain. In mixtures, EE2 and LNG exerted additive estrogenic effects both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that some environmental progestin could exert effects that will add to those of environmental (xeno-)estrogens. Moreover, our zebrafish specific assays are valuable tools that could be used in risk assessment for both single chemicals and their mixtures.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Four phase 1 studies were conducted in healthy subjects to evaluate the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between mirabegron and metformin, warfarin, digoxin, or a combination oral contraceptive (COC).Thirty-two male subjects received metformin (500 mg twice daily) or mirabegron (160 mg once daily) alone, in combination or with placebo. Twenty-four male and female subjects received single doses of warfarin (25 mg) alone and in combination with mirabegron (100 mg once daily). Twenty-five male and female subjects were administered digoxin (0.25 mg) alone and in combination with mirabegron (100 mg once daily). Thirty female subjects received low-dose COC containing ethinylestradiol (EE)/ (LNG) (30/150 µg once daily) in combination with mirabegron (100 mg once daily) or placebo. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by non-compartmental methods. Absence of a Pharmacokinetic interaction was concluded if the 90 % confidence intervals (CI) of geometric least-squares means ratio of area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (C ) were contained within the standard 80-125 % no-effect boundaries. The effect of mirabegron on warfarin International Normalized Ratio (INR) was also assessed.Mirabegron increased digoxin AUC and C by 27 and 29 %, respectively, indicating that mirabegron is a weak inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in vivo. Co-administration of mirabegron did not affect the pharmacokinetics of metformin, warfarin, EE and LNG, or warfarin INR, except for a slight extension of the 90 % CI for the C  ratio for metformin (lower limit 79 %). Metformin decreased mirabegron AUC and C  by 21 %. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild, and all resolved by study end.No dose adjustment of either drug is required when mirabegron is administered concomitantly with metformin, warfarin or COC. Patients receiving mirabegron with digoxin may require additional monitoring of digoxin concentrations with dose adjustments where necessary, due to its narrow therapeutic index.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25800084>Transdermal contraception methods: today's patches and new options on the horizon.</a></h2><p>The first contraceptive patch with ethinyl estradiol (EE) and norelgestromin in the United States demonstrated that there was a tremendous interest in topical methods, which could provide patient convenience, steady-state hormonal levels and reassurance of ongoing coverage, while maintaining efficacy and good bleeding patterns. Unfortunately, concerns about increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk diminished its popularity. Another version in Europe and Canada had slightly lower estrogen doses, but questions were raised about its VTE risk too based on its progestin. To fill that gap, two new contraceptive patches with lower estrogen levels have been developed and extensively tested.This article provides a short overview of the first set of patches followed by discussions of the pharmacokinetics of the two experimental patches as well as the results of their clinical trials, including information about efficacy, bleeding patterns and tolerability.Given the recent increased use of first tier contraceptive methods (Intrauterine devices and implants), there may be interest in new patches.

We aimed to quantify this risk considering both progestogen type and estrogen dose.PubMed, Embase and LIVIVO were searched for relevant publications until April 2017. Case-control and cohort studies including healthy women taking COC and assessing incident VTE as outcome were selected. Adjusted relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) derived from random effects model using a generic inverse-variance approach are reported.Overall, 1,359 references were identified and 17 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled RR of VTE was associated with various COC, with the association depending on their respective estrogen dose and progestogen type. Compared to the reference,  with 30-40 μg ethinylestradiol, the overall risk of VTE was higher for all other COC. Preparations with desogestrel with 30-40 μg estrogen showed the highest relative risk (RR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.33-1.59), while RRs for drospirenone (30-40 μg ethinylestradiol) and desogestrel (30-40/20 μg ethinylestradiol) were lower. COC containing gestodene and cyproterone with 30-40 μg estrogen showed the lowest risk (RR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.15-1.41 and RR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.12-1.49, respectively).Compared to  with 30-40 μg ethinylestradiol, all COC showed a significantly increased VTE risk. The association varied depending on the progestogen type and the dose of estrogen. Our results suggest that the prescription of COC with the lowest possible dose of ethinylestradiol may help to avoid VTE cases among young, healthy women.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

At the end of each treatment period, subjects underwent predose sampling for concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and progesterone and serial PK sampling for plasma LNG, EO, and CAB concentrations.Twenty women were enrolled, and 19 completed the study. One subject was withdrawn due to an adverse event unrelated to study medications. Geometric least squares mean ratios (90% confidence interval) of LNG + CAB vs. LNG alone for LNG area under the plasma concentration-time curve over the dosing interval of duration τ and maximum observed plasma concentration were 1.12 (1.07-1.18) and 1.05 (0.96-1.15), respectively. Geometric least squares mean ratio (90% confidence interval) of EO + CAB vs. EO alone for EO area under the plasma concentration-time curve over the dosing interval of duration τ and maximum observed plasma concentration were 1.02 (0.97-1.08) and 0.92 (0.83-1.03), respectively. Steady-state CAB PK parameters were comparable to historical values. There was no apparent difference in mean luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and progesterone concentrations between periods. No clinically significant trends in laboratory values, vital signs, or electrocardiography values were observed.Repeat doses of oral CAB had no significant effect on LNG/EO PK or pharmacodynamics, which supports CAB coadministration with LNG/EO OCs in clinical practice.© 2017 ViiV Healthcare.

In women, progestin-only contraceptives often fail to block ovulation and are believed to act by altering cervix physiology. Herein, we assessed oviductal glycoprotein 1 (OVGP1) in the macaque cervix as a marker for progestogen action.Rhesus macaques were treated with estradiol (E ), E plus progesterone (P), and E plus  (LNG), a contraceptive progestin. Samples consisted of archived blocks of midcervix mucosa (epithelium and lamina propria) and fresh epithelial cells collected non-invasively by cytobrush. OVGP1 was assayed by quantitative real-time PCR and localized by immunocytochemistry.OVGP1 transcript was maximal after E and reduced after treatment with E  + P (P < .05). LNG also reduced OVGP1 expression (P < .05). OVGP1-specific staining localized to epithelial cells, and transcript was quantifiable in cytobrush collected samples.OVGP1 expression in cytobrush samples of macaque cervix provides a non-invasive indicator of contraceptive progestin action.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Faldaprevir is known to inhibit P-glycoprotein, CYP3A4, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1. This study evaluated the effect of steady-state 240 mg faldaprevir on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol (EE) and  (LNG) in healthy premenopausal women. In period 1, subjects received EE/LNG once daily (QD) for 14 days. Blood samples were taken on days 1, 11, and 12, with intensive PK blood sampling for EE and LNG on day 13. In period 2, subjects received EE-LNG QD and 240 mg faldaprevir QD on days 14 to 21 (240 mg faldaprevir twice daily on day 14). Blood samples were taken on days 14, 19, and 20, with PK profiling samples obtained for EE and LNG on day 21. A total of 15/16 subjects completed the study. Overall, EE and LNG exposure (assessed by the area under the curve) was approximately 1.4-fold higher when EE and LNG were coadministered with faldaprevir than when administered alone. Median t1/2 (terminal half-life in plasma at steady state) values were prolonged for both EE (2.4 h longer) and LNG (4.7 h longer) when EE and LNG were coadministered with faldaprevir. The mean oral clearance and apparent volume of distribution of both EE and LNG were lower (∼ 30%) when EE and LNG were coadministered with faldaprevir. Coadministration of faldaprevir and an oral contraceptive resulted in a moderate increase in exposure to both EE and LNG.

Endocrine effects.</a></h2><p>To determine whether adding dehydroepiandrosterone to combined oral contraceptives (COCs) maintains physiological levels of free testosterone.A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover study conducted in 81 healthy women (age range: 20-35 years; Body mass index (BMI) range: 18-35 kg/m) using oral contraceptives. Androgens, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) were measured, and free testosterone and the free testosterone index were calculated. Subjects discontinued oral contraceptive use for at least one menstrual cycle before being randomized to receive five cycles of ethinyl estradiol (EE) combined with either  (EE/LNG group) or drospirenone (EE/DRSP group) together with either dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (50 mg/day orally) or placebo. Subsequently, all subjects crossed over to the other treatment arm for an additional five cycles.Both COCs decreased the levels of all androgens measured. Significant decreases (p<.05) were found with EE/LNG and EE/DRSP for total testosterone (54.5% and 11.3%, respectively) and for free testosterone (66.8% and 75.6%, respectively). Adding DHEA to the COCs significantly increased all androgens compared to placebo. Moreover, including DHEA restored free testosterone levels to baseline values in both COC groups and total testosterone levels to baseline in the EE/LNG group and above baseline in the EE/DRSP group. SHBG concentrations were significantly higher with EE/DRSP compared to EE/LNG (p<.0001). The addition of DHEA did not affect the levels of SHBG.Taking COCs reduces total and free testosterone levels and increases SHBG concentrations. By coadministration with DHEA, physiological levels of total and free testosterone are restored while using EE/LNG. With EE/DRSP, only the free testosterone level is normalized by DHEA coadministration.A daily oral dose of 50-mg DHEA maintains physiological free and total testosterone levels in women who are using an EE/LNG-containing COC.Copyright © 2016 Pantarhei Bioscience.

In combination with drospirenone (DRSP) or  (LNG), E4 blocks ovulation and has less effect on haemostatic biomarkers in comparison with ethinylestradiol (EE) combined with DRSP. This study evaluates the impact of several doses of E4/DRSP and E4/LNG on safety parameters such as liver function, lipid , bone markers and growth endocrine parameters.This was a dose-finding, single-centre, controlled study performed in healthy women aged 18 to 35 years with a documented pretreatment ovulatory cycle. Participants received 5 mg or 10 mg E4/3 mg DRSP; 5 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg E4/150 μg LNG; or 20 μg EE/3 mg DRSP as a comparator for three consecutive cycles in a 24/4-day regimen. Changes from baseline to end of treatment in liver parameters, lipid , bone markers and growth endocrinology were evaluated.A total of 109 women were included in the study. Carrier proteins were minimally affected in the E4/DRSP and E4/LNG groups, in comparison with the EE/DRSP group, where a significant increase in sex hormone-binding globulin was observed. Similarly, minor effects on lipoproteins were observed in the E4 groups, and the effects on triglycerides elicited by the E4 groups were significantly lower than those in the EE/DRSP group. No imbalances in bone markers were observed in any groups. No alterations in insulin-like growth factor were observed in the E4 groups.E4-containing combinations have a limited effect on liver function, lipid , and bone and growth endocrine parameters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26639216>Preparation of water stable methyl-modified metal-organic framework-5/polyacrylonitrile composite nanofibers via electrospinning and their application for solid-phase extraction of two estrogenic drugs in urine samples.</a></h2><p>The nanofibers of methyl-modified metal-organic framework-5/polyacrylonitrile composite (CH3MOF-5/PAN) were successfully synthesized and used as a solid-phase extraction (SPE) sorbent for pre-concentration of two estrogenic drugs,  and megestrol acetate, in urine samples. A simple, cheap and accessible electrospinning method was employed to prepare a water stable CH3MOF-5/PAN composite. The nanofibers were packed into the mini-disc cartridges to be used as SPE devices. They were also characterized by scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and N2 adsorption-desorption experiments. The effects of different parameters influencing the extraction efficiency including the type of eluent and its volume, the amount of the sorbent, pH, the ionic strength, the sample volume and the reusability of the sorbent were investigated and optimized. Under the optimized conditions, the linearity varied in range of 0.05-100μgL(-1) with R(2) values higher than 0.999. The limit of detection for both of the analytes was 0.02μgL(-1). The applicability of the method was examined by analyzing the analytes in the urine samples. The recovery of the analytes varied in the range of 82.8-94.8% which shows capability of the method for the determination of the drugs in the urine samples.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

All participants had symptomatic adenomyosis (visual analogue scale [VAS] ≥7 and/or pictorial blood loss assessment chart [PBAC] score >100) diagnosed by transvaginal sonography. Follow-up was at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after LNG-IUS placement. The primary outcome was symptom relief. Secondary outcomes included LNG-IUS retention status; changes in uterine volume; serum levels of cancer antigen 125 (CA125); menstruation pattern; and adverse events.In all, 374 (33.7%) participants completed 60 months of LNG-IUS treatment. The VAS, verbal rating scale, PBAC score, hemoglobin level, uterine volume, and serum CA125 level all showed marked improvements at this time point when compared with baseline (P<0.05 for all comparisons). The cumulative retention rate of LNG-IUS was 56.2%. Changes in menstruation pattern at 60 months included amenorrhea (n=97, 25.9%) and shortened periods (n=82, 21.9%).

The combination of anastrozole (ATZ) and  (LNG) in an IVR with an intended 4-week wearing period has been considered for long-term treatment of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain. A randomized, parallel-group, multicenter phase 2b study to assess the efficacy and safety of different dose combinations in women with symptomatic endometriosis has recently been performed. This paper will focus on the investigation of pharmacokinetic (PK) effects of ATZ on LNG using data collected from this study. Two hundred sixteen patients were randomized to the treatment group with IVRs releasing LNG 40 μg/day alone or in combination with ATZ 300 μg/day, 600 μg/day, or 1050 μg/day for 12 weeks. PK blood samples were taken before dosing and before IVR replacement or removal (days 28, 56, and 84). The primary PK parameter was the plasma concentration in apparent steady state of ATZ and LNG at the end of each IVR wearing period. Results of PK analysis demonstrate that ATZ concentrations increased proportionally with increasing dose (geometric mean values of 7.85, 15.48, and 22.61 μg/L at 300, 600, and 1050 μg/day nominal release, respectively). All point estimates for LNG concentration in apparent steady state ratios between the mono and combination IVR groups were close to 1, and the 90% confidence interval limits were in the 0.80 to 1.25 range (1.01 [0.85-1.19], 1.03 [0.88-1.20], 0.94 [0.80-1.10]). In conclusion, our data indicate there is no evidence of drug-drug interaction of ATZ on LNG.© 2019, The Authors.

Effects on .</a></h2><p>The risk-benefit profile of any pharmacologic agent must be evaluated against risks connected with the events to be avoided. This is especially true in the case of hormonal contraception, not intended to combat a disease. Over the six decades during which their use has progressively expanded, the risk-benefit profile of combined oral contraceptives (COC) has substantially changed, with new combinations, dosages and mode of administration appearing on the market. Area covered: In a series of articles, recent information on the complex issue of COC risks and benefits will be reviewed in the hope of providing an updated picture. The present article reviews  changes occurring during use of modern combinations of estrogens (ethinyl estradiol, estradiol, estradiol valerate and estetrol) and new progestins (desogestrel, gestodene, dienogest, drospirenone, nomegestrol acetate), often compared to classic compounds, such as . Three categories of  effects in healthy women are detailed: on carbohydrates, lipid and bone mineral content. Expert commentary: Overall, the picture is reassuring: the new generations of progestins are basically devoid of androgenic, estrogenic or glucocorticoid related side-effects. This should result in an improved safety profile, although past history teaches us that that large comparative and surveillance studies are required before firm conclusions can be drawn. At any rate, available evidence indicates that  effects of third and fourth generation progestins, especially when they are combined with natural estrogens, are minimal and, if used in healthy women, should not cause concern.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29408422>Concordance of self-reported hormonal contraceptive use and presence of exogenous hormones in serum among African women.</a></h2><p>Studies that rely on self-report to investigate the relationship between hormonal contraceptive use and HIV acquisition and transmission, as well as other health outcomes, could have compromised results due to misreporting. We determined the frequency of misreported hormonal contraceptive use among African women with and at risk for HIV.We tested 1102 archived serum samples from 664 African women who had participated in prospective HIV prevention studies. Using a novel high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay, we quantified exogenous hormones for injectables (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone), oral contraceptives (OC) ( or ethinyl estradiol) and implants ( or etonogestrel) and compared them to self-reported use.Among women reporting hormonal contraceptive use, 258/358 (72%) of samples were fully concordant with self-report, as were 642/744 (86%) of samples from women reporting no hormonal contraceptive use. However, 42/253 (17%) of samples from women reporting injectable use, 41/66 (62%) of samples from self-reported OC users and 3/39 (8%) of samples from self-reported implant users had no quantifiable hormones. Among self-reported nonusers, 102/744 (14%) had ≥1 hormone present. Concordance between self-reported method and exogenous hormones did not differ by HIV status.Among African women with and at risk for HIV, testing of exogenous hormones revealed agreement with self-reported contraceptive use for most women. However, unexpected exogenous hormones were identified among self-reported hormonal contraceptive users and nonusers, and an important fraction of women reporting hormonal contraceptive use had no hormones detected; absence of oral contraceptive hormones could be due, at least in part, to samples taken during the hormone-free interval. Misreporting of hormonal contraceptive use could lead to biased results in observational studies of the relationship between contraceptive use and health outcomes.Research studies investigating associations between hormonal contraceptive use and HIV should consider validating self-reported use by objective measures; because both overreporting and underreporting of use occur, potential misclassification based on self-report could lead to biased results in directions that cannot be easily predicted.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Ethinyl estradiol and  have been mainstay contraceptive hormones for the last four decades. Surprisingly, there is scant information regarding their action on the central nervous system and behavior. Intact female rats received three weeks of subcutaneous ethinyl estradiol (10 or 30μg/rat/day),  (20 or 60μg/rat/day), a combination of both (10/20μg/rat/day and 30/60μg/rat/day), or vehicle. Subsequently, the rats were tested in three versions of the novel object recognition test to assess learning and memory, and a battery of tests for anxiety-like behavior. Serum estradiol and ovarian weights were measured. All treatment groups exhibited low endogenous 17β-estradiol levels at the time of testing. Dose-dependent effects of drug treatment manifested in both cognitive and anxiety tests. All low dose drugs decreased anxiety-like behavior and impaired performance on novel object recognition. In contrast, the high dose ethinyl estradiol increased anxiety-like behavior and improved performance in cognitive testing. In the cell molecular analyses, low doses of all drugs induced a decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA and protein in the locus coeruleus. At the same time, low doses of ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol/ increased galanin protein in this structure. Consistent with the findings above, the low dose treatments of ethinyl estradiol and combination ethinyl estradiol/ reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA in the hippocampus. These effects of ethinyl estradiol 10μg alone and in combination with  20μg suggest a diminution of norepinephrine input into the hippocampus resulting in a decline in learning and memory.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Most studies show that obese women exhibit modestly lower plasma concentrations of these drugs (circa 30%) when given the same doses as normal-weight women. While the mechanism is uncertain, precedence in the literature suggests that this is due to body weight-related differences in  rates.

However, a considerable amount of excess drug often remains in the ring upon removal. The current study focuses on comparing 2 IVRs releasing  (LNG). Both formulations were designed to release 40 μg of LNG daily, however, with a significant difference in the total amount of drug (10.6 vs. 176.9 mg). Numerical simulations and in vitro release rate testing were utilized in designing the IVRs and confirming the similarity of drug release. Moreover, a pharmacokinetic (PK) study was performed in 13 healthy Japanese women to investigate both formulations during the intended wearing period of 28 days. The primary PK metrics was the average concentration of LNG in plasma at defined time points under stable conditions. Statistical evaluation of the ratio of the main PK metrics indicated values almost in the bioequivalence range. Furthermore, drug content determinations for used and unused IVRs were analyzed for confirming the expected drug delivery in vivo. In summary, it was shown that with proper design, even major differences in the total drug content of IVR formulations might not result in significant effects in the in vitro and in vivo release properties.Copyright © 2018 American Pharmacists Association®.

It enters the environment as a component of wastewater treatment plant effluent, and has been measured at low ng/L concentrations in surface waters. It has been shown to activate fish androgen receptors, causing the physical masculinization of females, changes in reproductive behavior, and decreases in fecundity. In the present study, the effects of  exposure on early-stage oogenesis in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) was examined. Adult females were exposed to 0, 10, or 100 ng/L  for 14 d using a flow-through exposure system. The ovaries from each female were then removed via dissection and weighed for gonadosomatic index (GSI) calculations, and oocytes from one lobe preserved in Serra's fixative. Total numbers of late-stage vitellogenic oocytes exhibiting a germinal vesicle were then quantified. In a second exposure, blood plasma samples were collected from adult females and analyzed for vitellogenin concentrations using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Females exposed to both concentrations of  developed male secondary sexual characteristics in a dose-dependent manner, and ovaries contained significantly fewer late stage oocytes. Exposure to 100 ng/L of  resulted in decreased GSI and blood plasma vitellogenin concentrations. The results suggest that female exposure to  alone may have profound effects on reproduction in progestin-contaminated environments.

Individually, the estrogen 17β-estradiol (E2) and Levo can improve cognition in preclinical models. However, although these hormones are often given together clinically, the impact of the E2 + Levo combination on cognitive function has yet to be methodically examined. Thus, we investigated E2 + Levo treatment on a cognitive battery in middle-aged, ovariectomized rats. When administered alone, E2 and Levo treatments each enhanced spatial working memory relative to vehicle treatment, whereas the E2 + Levo combination impaired high working memory load performance relative to E2 only and Levo only treatments. There were no effects on spatial reference memory. Mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases pathway activation, which is involved in memory formation and estrogen-induced memory effects, was evaluated in 5 brain regions implicated in learning and memory. A distinct relationship was seen in the E2-only treatment group between mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases pathway activation in the frontal cortex and working memory performance. Collectively, the results indicate that the differential neurocognitive effects of combination versus sole treatments are vital considerations as we move forward as a field to develop novel, and to understand currently used, exogenous hormone regimens across the lifespan.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

For that, a mesocosm experiment was implemented where adult zebrafish were exposed to combined temperature and the progestin  (LNG) for 21 days. Considering that the liver is one of the organs where there is a greater metabolization and accumulation of toxicants, the main objective of this work was to assess the effects of both stressors on the female zebrafish hepatocytes morphology and functioning, through stereological and immunohistochemical techniques. Our results revealed an increase of coefficient of variation of the number distribution of hepatocytes volume (CV(υ)) for individuals exposed to LNG, which denotes an increase of the hepatocytes size variability and is suggestive of functional impacts. This was corroborated by the signs of increased glycogen content with the exposure to increased LNG concentrations and temperature, indicating modified hepatocyte glycogen metabolism. Such disturbances can be considered indicators that the fish had to deal with impacts caused by the stress factors. Regarding the immunoreactivity, from the four proteins selected (catalase, CYP1A, HSP90 and Vtg), just in two of them (catalase and Vtg) were observed some responses to both stressors. For catalase there was a hormetic response, in which exposure to lower LNG concentrations caused a significant higher positive immunostaining than under higher LNG concentrations. While, for Vtg, significant effects of temperature and LNG existed, in which a decline in Vtg immunostaining was observed with exposure to higher temperature and lower LNG concentrations. These results should be seen as a warning sign about fine impacts of multiple stressors, such as temperature and progestogens, on the structure and functioning of zebrafish liver and potentially in other aquatic organisms, and on their health implications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Absorption of sacubitril/valsartan and conversion of sacubitril (prodrug) to sacubitrilat (neprilysin inhibitor) was rapid with maximum plasma concentrations of sacubitril, sacubitrilat, and valsartan (angiotensin receptor blocker) reaching within 0.5, 1.5-2.0, and 2.0-3.0 h, respectively. With a two-fold increase in dose, an increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve was proportional for sacubitril, ~1.9-fold for sacubitrilat, and ~1.7-fold for valsartan in healthy subjects. Following multiple twice-daily administration, steady-state maximum plasma concentration was reached within 3 days, showing no accumulation for sacubitril and valsartan, while ~1.6-fold accumulation for sacubitrilat. Sacubitril is eliminated predominantly as sacubitrilat through the kidney; valsartan is eliminated mainly by biliary route. Drug-drug interactions of sacubitril/valsartan were evaluated with medications commonly used in patients with heart failure including furosemide, warfarin, digoxin, carvedilol, /ethinyl estradiol combination, amlodipine, omeprazole, hydrochlorothiazide, intravenous nitrates, metformin, statins, and sildenafil. Co-administration with sacubitril/valsartan increased the maximum plasma concentration (~2.0-fold) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (1.3-fold) of atorvastatin; however, it did not affect the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin.

Recently, as the process of exploring the brief molecular mechanisms of tumorgenesis, microRNAs (miRNAs) have attracted much more attention.In this study, we first confirmed that microRNA-197 (miR-197) was down-regulated significantly in human uterus leiomyoma by quantity real-time polymerase chain reaction, compared to normal uterus myometrium. Then we observed the potential effects of miR-197 overexpression on human uterus leiomyoma cells by cell counting kit 8, wound healing assay, and flow cytometric assessment separately.The data showed that miR-197 could inhibit cell proliferation, induce cell apoptosis, and block cell migration in vitro. Coincidently,  (LNG), a well-known uterus leiomyoma therapy, could induce miR-197 expression in human uterus leiomyoma cells, and over-expression of miR-197 showed a synergy effect on human uterus leiomyoma cell proliferation and apoptosis with LNG.In this study, the data showed that miR-197 could play an anti-oncogenic role in human uterus leiomyoma cells, and cooperate with LNG on the cell proliferation and apoptosis, which suggested that miR-197 might be a potential target and provided database for clinical treatment.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Thus, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and  effects of a POC, the -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), in women with PCOS followed up over a period of 6 months compared to baseline and to women without PCOS. Thus, an observational, prospective, controlled study was conducted on 30 women with a diagnosis of PCOS who presented adverse effect secondary to the use of combined oral contraceptives (nausea, headache, mastalgia or vomiting; PCOS group) paired with 30 ovulatory women without PCOS (control group), both groups being free of comorbidities and having chosen the LNG-IUS as contraceptive. Clinical, laboratory, and ultrasonographic variables were evaluated immediately before LNG-IUS insertion and 6 months after the use of this method. Before LNG-IUS insertion, the PCOS group had higher total testosterone levels (P = .04), lower HDL levels (P = .04), and greater ovarian volume (P < .01) than the control group. Six months after LNG-IUS insertion, there was a 2.3% increase in abdominal circumference (P = .04) and a 3.4% increase in fasting glycemia (P = .02). On the other hand, mean ovarian volume was 10% smaller compared to the volume found before LNG-IUS insertion (P = .04), LDL levels were reduced by 5.2% (P = .03), and total cholesterol levels were reduced by 6.7% (P < .01) compared to baseline evaluation in the PCOS group. The remaining variables did not differ significantly during the 6 months of observation. The control group did not show significant changes compared to the period before LNG-IUS insertion. When the groups were compared after the 6-month follow-up, only glycemia showed a statistically significant variation between the groups, with glycemia levels increasing by 3.4% in the PCOS group and decreasing by 2.6% in the control group (P = .008). In conclusion, the use of the LNG-IUS for 6 months was not associated with relevant changes in clinical or  variables of women with no comorbidities regardless of the presence of PCOS.© The Author(s) 2016.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27925651>Model-Based Dose Selection for Intravaginal Ring Formulations Releasing Anastrozole and  Intended for the Treatment of Endometriosis Symptoms.</a></h2><p>Pharmacokinetics (PK) of anastrozole (ATZ) and  (LNG) released from an intravaginal ring (IVR) intended to treat endometriosis symptoms were characterized, and the exposure-response relationship focusing on the development of large ovarian follicle-like structures was investigated by modeling and simulation to support dose selection for further studies. A population PK analysis and simulations were performed for ATZ and LNG based on clinical phase 1 study data from 66 healthy women. A PK/PD model was developed to predict the probability of a maximum follicle size ≥30 mm and the potential contribution of ATZ beside the known LNG effects. Population PK models for ATZ and LNG were established where the interaction of LNG with sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) as well as a stimulating effect of estradiol on SHBG were considered. Furthermore, simulations showed that doses of 40 μg/d LNG combined with 300, 600, or 1050 μg/d ATZ reached anticipated exposure levels for both drugs, facilitating selection of ATZ and LNG doses in the phase 2 dose-finding study. The main driver for the effect on maximum follicle size appears to be unbound LNG exposure. A 50% probability of maximum follicle size ≥30 mm was estimated for 40 μg/d LNG based on the exposure-response analysis. ATZ in the dose range investigated does not increase the risk for ovarian cysts as occurs with LNG at a dose that does not inhibit ovulation.© 2016, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25865020>Use of hormonal therapy is associated with reduced nerve fiber density in deep infiltrating, rectovaginal endometriosis.</a></h2><p>To study the density of nerve fibers in cases of deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) of the rectovaginal septum in relation to various clinical factors.A research laboratory-based study.A tertiary center together with a research laboratory.Archived DIE tissue samples from 45 women operated upon for rectovaginal septum DIE were re-examined histologically, and by immunohistochemistry.The effect of progestogens or combined oral contraceptives on the density of nerve fibers, and the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) and its high-affinity receptor (tyrosine kinase receptor A, Trk-A).The use of hormonal therapy was associated with reduced densities of sympathetic, parasympathetic and sensory nerve fibers in DIE lesions. Density of total nerve fibers (with pan-neuronal marker PGP9.5) was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in lesions collected from hormone-treated women (8.6/mm², 4.2-20.8/mm²; median density, from 25th to 75th quartiles) compared with that in lesions from untreated women (24.9/mm², 11.2-34.9/mm²). DIE lesions stained strongly for NGF and its receptor Trk-A. Expression of NGF, but not of Trk-A, was significantly reduced during use of hormonal therapy.Use of hormonal therapy was associated with significantly reduced nerve fiber density in DIE lesions. This may be an important mechanism of action of hormonal therapy for controlling DIE pain symptoms. The expression of estrogen-regulated NGF and its receptor was only partially suppressed during the use of hormonal therapy, suggesting that local estrogen action is often maintained during conventional hormonal therapy in cases of DIE.© 2015 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29215767>Exposure to  increases nest acquisition success and decreases sperm motility in the male fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas).</a></h2><p>Progestins are utilized as a component of human contraceptives, and commonly enter the environment via wastewater treatment plant effluent.

It is composed of a hollow cylindrical drug reservoir (containing  and polydimethylsiloxane), which is covered with a release rate controlling silicone membrane. This structure presents a manufacturing challenge and to date, there have been no literature reports on the manufacturing, product design and quality evaluation of these hollow cylindrical intrauterine devices. It is vital to develop a reproducible and robust manufacturing process for these long-acting intrauterine devices or systems to obtain an understanding the in vitro and in vivo performance of such drug-device combinations. In this study, a twin-syringe method with a customized mold was developed to manufacture hollow cylindrical polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based  intrauterine systems (LNG-IUSs). Different mold materials, curing temperatures and times were screened to fabricate PDMS-drug reservoirs with good quality characteristics (easy demolding, good appearance and appropriate physicochemical characteristics). The prepared PDMS-drug reservoirs were covered with the release rate controlling membrane to fabricate the LNG-IUSs. Physicochemical characterization (drug content and content uniformity, powder X-Ray diffraction (PXRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of the PDMS-drug reservoirs with different drug loadings (10%, 25% and 50% w/w) was conducted. Real-time in vitro drug release testing of LNG-IUSs with different drug loading was performed in normal saline (0.9% w/v NaCl) at 37 °C using a water bath shaker rotating at 100 rpm. The prepared PDMS-drug reservoirs demonstrated good and reproducible quality characteristics including appearance (smooth surfaces), targeted drug loading and good drug content uniformity in the PDMS matrix. The PXRD showed that the crystallinity of the API was maintained inside the PDMS matrix. DSC, TGA and FTIR confirmed the structure of the drug and the PDMS, indicating no interaction between the drug and the PDMS matrix in the prepared LNG-IUSs. Real-time in vitro drug release from the LNG-IUSs with different drug loadings showed zero-order release kinetics, and the drug release rate (based on daily release percentage) was inversely proportional to the drug loading.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Two main methods are currently available: oral pills or the copper-T intrauterine device. In recent years there has been some debate regarding the efficacy of oral therapy in obese women. In this brief commentary we review new evidence, published after the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) referral of 2014, relating to the effect of obesity on the pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy of  EC in light of some of the concerns that have been raised.  A PubMed literature search ("" and "emergency contraception") was conducted between 1 January 2005 to 31 March 2018; results from the main clinical trials are discussed. Additional literature known to the authors and identified from the reference lists of cited publications was included.  Overall, it should be noted that, in studies which determined pregnancy rates across different weight or BMI categories, the overall pregnancy rate was low (1-2%) and there was no direct evidence that lower  plasma levels contributed to an increased pregnancy rate in obese women. This conclusion was reached by the EMA referral in 2014 and they concluded that emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) could be taken regardless of body weight or BMI, as soon as possible after UPSI. Since the EMA review, additional evidence has been published regarding this topic. This includes PK data (which can neither support, nor deny the previously submitted meta-analyses during the Article 31 Referral procedure), or re-analyses of the previously submitted data.  Evidence published since the EMA referral in 2014 does not change the original conclusions of the agency, which recommended that ECPs could be taken regardless of body weight or BMI, as soon as possible after UPSI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28219738>Ulipristal acetate administration at mid-cycle changes gene expression profiling of endometrial biopsies taken during the receptive period of the human menstrual cycle.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of mid-cycle administration of Ulipristal acetate (UPA) on gene expression in endometrial biopsies taken during the receptive phase of the cycle.

While LNG has established effects on the stromal and glandular compartments of the endometrial tissue, its effect on the endometrial endothelial cells has not been investigated. We examined whether LNG regulates fibrinolytic factors, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) secreted by human endometrial endothelial cells (HEECs) and determined the steroid receptor through which LNG exerts its effect on the endothelium.The HEECs were treated with LNG or progesterone and levels of tPA and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) measured. The HEECs were specifically examined for the presence of androgen receptors through Western blot.  ± flutamide were added to HEECs and the levels of tPA and uPA were examined.An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay performed on culture media confirmed a statistically significant decrease in tPA levels in cells treated with LNG (77.80% ± 8.0% of control; n = 5, P < .05 vs control) but not progesterone. The androgen receptor (110 kDa) was detected in HEEC lysates. The decrease in tPA was blocked by the addition of flutamide (101.3% ± 16% of control), a classic nonsteroidal androgen receptor blocker. There was no change in uPA or PAI-1 levels in cells treated with LNG. decreases tPA levels through the androgen receptor in HEECs. Thus, LNG inhibits tPA secretion by the endometrial endothelial cell. This response suggests reduction in HMB with LNG-IUS could reflect an LNG-mediated promotion of hemostasis.© The Author(s) 2016.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25740268>Effect of pradigastat, a diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of a combination oral contraceptive in healthy female subjects.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between pradigastat, a potent and selective diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 inhibitor, and Levora-28®, a combination oral contraceptive (COC) containing 30 μg ethinylestradiol (EE) and 150 μg  (LVG).An open-label, single-sequence three-period (period 1, single dose of COC; period 2, pradigastat 100 mg x 3 days followed by 40 mg x 7 days; and period 3, both pradigastat 40 mg and a single dose of COC) study involving 24 healthy female subjects of childbearing potential was conducted.The pharmacokinetic parameters of EE were similar when administered alone or in combination with pradigastat, as the 90% confidence interval (CI) of geometric mean ratios for EE exposure (AUC and C(max)) were all within the range of 0.80 - 1.25.

This analysis integrated data from 10 clinical pharmacology studies and resulted in a single, comprehensive population PK model (and its applications) describing the PK of  and its variability for 6 -containing contraceptives: 3 intrauterine systems (IUSs;  [LNG]-IUS 20 [Mirena ], LNG-IUS 12 [Kyleena ], and LNG-IUS 8 [Jaydess /Skyla ]); 2 oral contraceptives (the progestin-only pill [Microlut /Norgeston ] and the combined oral contraceptive [Miranova ]); and a subdermal implant (Jadelle ). The -containing contraceptives administered orally or as an implant act mainly via their systemic (unbound)  exposure, whereas  administered via an IUS is released directly into the uterine cavity, resulting in lower systemic  concentrations. The integrated population PK analysis revealed that the combined oral contraceptive led to the highest  exposure, followed by the progestin-only pill and the implant, which led to similar  exposure, and the IUSs, which led to the lowest  exposure (in decreasing order: LNG-IUS 20, LNG-IUS 12, and LNG-IUS 8). The difference was even more distinct at the end of the indicated duration of use of 3 years (LNG-IUS 8) and 5 years (LNG-IUS 20 and LNG-IUS 12).

Only a few studies have evaluated the long-term effectiveness of the device for preventing endometrioma recurrence, and the effects of a -releasing intrauterine system as a maintenance therapy remain unclear.The objective of the study was to evaluate whether a maintenance -releasing intrauterine system is effective for preventing postoperative endometrioma recurrence.From May 2011 through March 2012, a randomized controlled trial including 80 patients with endometriomas undergoing laparoscopic cystectomy followed by six cycles of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment was conducted. After surgery, the patients were randomized to groups that did or did not receive a -releasing intrauterine system (intervention group, n = 40, vs control group, n = 40). The primary outcome was endometrioma recurrence 30 months after surgery. The secondary outcomes included dysmenorrhea, CA125 levels, noncyclic pelvic pain, and side effects.Endometrioma recurrence at 30 months did not significantly differ between the 2 groups (the intervention group, 10 of 40, 25% vs the control group 15 of 40, 37.5%; hazard ratio, 0.60, 95% confidence interval, 0.27-1.33, P = .209). The intervention group exhibited a lower dysmenorrhea recurrence rate, with an estimated hazard ratio of 0.32 (95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.83, P = .019). Over a 30 month follow-up, the intervention group exhibited a greater reduction in dysmenorrhea as assessed with a visual analog scale score (mean ± SD, 60.8 ± 25.5 vs 38.7 ± 25.9, P < .001, 95% confidence interval, 10.7-33.5), noncyclic pelvic pain visual analog scale score (39.1 ± 10.9 vs 30.1 ± 14.7, P = .014, 95% confidence interval, 1.9-16.1), and CA125 (median [interquartile range], -32.1 [-59.1 to 14.9], vs -15.6 [-33.0 to 5.0], P = .001) compared with the control group.

Women have more complex hormonal fluctuations than men and commonly take drugs such as hormonal contraceptives that are shown to affect biomarkers used in these doping tests. In this study, we followed six women's urinary steroid profile during one menstrual cycle, including both glucuronides and sulfate conjugated fractions. Additionally, we studied what happens to the steroidal module of the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP) after administration of an emergency contraceptive (, NorLevo®). The study shows that there are large individual variations in all metabolites included in the ABP and that the administration of emergency contraceptives may lead to suspicious steroid profile findings in the ABP. Urinary epitestosterone concentration increased during the menstrual cycle, leading to a decrease in the testosterone/epitestosterone ratio. The ratios followed in the ABP varied widely throughout the menstrual cycle, the coefficient of variation (CV) ranging from 4 to 99%. There was a 3-fold decrease in epitestosterone 24 h post administration of the emergency contraceptive pill and androsterone, etiocholanolone, and 5β- androstan-3α,17β-diol concentrations decreased about 2-fold. When analyzed with the ABP software, one of the six women had an atypical profile after taking the emergency contraceptive. Furthermore, we could not find any alterations in excretion routes (i.e., if the metabolites are excreted as glucuronide or sulfate conjugates) during the menstrual cycle or after administration of emergency contraceptive, indicating no direct effect on phase II enzymes.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27473275>Matrix and reservoir-type multipurpose vaginal rings for controlled release of dapivirine and .</a></h2><p>A matrix-type silicone elastomer vaginal ring providing 28-day continuous release of dapivirine (DPV) - a lead candidate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) microbicide compound - has recently demonstrated moderate levels of protection in two Phase III clinical studies.

(LNG) is effective as EC only when administered before, but not after ovulation. LNG EC taken in the pre-ovulatory and post-ovulatory phase results in shortening and lengthening of the index menstrual cycle, respectively. Whether the same applies to UPA is not known.Prospective, open-label clinical cohort study conducted on 700 women between May 2011 and March 2014.Seven hundred women requesting EC within 120 h after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse in the index menstrual cycle were recruited at a community family planning clinic in Hong Kong. Each subject received a single oral dose of UPA 30 mg, and 693 of them completed follow-up. Ovulatory status at the time of UPA administration was determined by serum progesterone level supplemented by menstrual history and ultrasound tracking. The main outcome measure was the percentage of pregnancies prevented (PPP).The PPP was significantly higher in subjects who were pre-ovulatory (77.6%) compared with those who were post-ovulatory (36.4%) at the time of UPA administration (P < 0.0001). The observed pregnancy rate following UPA administration was significantly lower than the expected pregnancy rate only in the pre-ovulatory group (P < 0.0001), but not the post-ovulatory group (P = 0.281). The overall failure rate was 1.7% (1.4 versus 2.1% in the pre- and post-ovulatory groups, respectively). Pre-ovulatory administration of UPA resulted in a small delay (median of 3 days), whereas post-ovulatory administration resulted in a minimal advancement (median of 1 day) of the next menstruation, compared with that predicted from previous menstrual pattern. More pre-ovulatory subjects (19.1%) than post-ovulatory subjects (7.8%) had deviation of the next menses of more than 7 days (P < 0.001).The ovulatory status of the subjects was determined based only on menstrual history and a spot sonographic finding together with serum hormonal profile at the time of recruitment.Our findings confirmed comparable efficacy of UPA in the Asian population as in western populations.

Visual analog scale (VAS), menstrual flow, uterine volume, serum CA125 levels and hemoglobin amounts were compared before and after the surgery. Meanwhile, postoperative pregnancy, adverse reactions, and recurrence were observed.VAS score, menstrual flow, uterine volume, and serum CA125 levels in 53 patients were significantly reduced after surgery (P < . 001). Moreover, statistical significances were obtained for VAS score at 13 and 6 months, menstrual flow at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, uterine volume at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months and CA125 levels at 1 and 3 months (P < .05). Of the 5 patients with fertility requirements, 1 became pregnant after IVF-ET, progressed to preterm, and delivered healthy twins. Among all related adverse reactions, amenorrhea was the most common (n = 20, 37.7%). There were no cases of LNG-IUS removal, ectopia, expulsion, and incarceration, except in 2 patients due to pregnancy, 1 due to uterine bleeding, and 1 due to Mirena perforation from incision of the uterine fundus. All patients showed no relapse.Adenomyomectomy using "H" type incision combined with Mirena constitutes a novel and effective conservative surgical procedure for adenomyosis treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27718294>Expression of anti-Müllerian hormone in two rat models of polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h2><p>Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels are two to three times higher in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but the mechanism of increased AMH levels in PCOS remains unclear. The purpose of our experiment was to investigate a change in AMH levels in two kinds of commonly used rat models and to determine an ideal model for future research of AMH in the pathogenesis of PCOS.Thirty female Sprague Dawley rats were treated using two modeling methods: implantation of a  silastic implant or injection with sodium prasterone sulfate plus human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Rats in the control group were implanted with a blank silastic stick. Serum steroid concentrations, ovarian morphology and ovarian expression of AMH and AMH-receptor II (RII) proteins were determined and their correlations were studied.The results from the  and hCG group were closer to those displayed by human PCOS patients than the sodium prasterone sulfate and hCG group. Ovarian local expression of AMH and AMH-RII was increased in these both models compared with the control group; however, an elevation of serum AMH concentration was not observed (12.53 ± 0.99 ng/ml and 13.22 ± 1.09 ng/ml vs 16.30 ± 0.98 ng/ml).The  and hCG model is more suitable for the study of PCOS in puberty.© 2016 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.</p></html>
