The fatty  composition of the lipid membrane of L. acidophilus La-5 was significantly different upon growth in MRS (containing Tween 80, an oleic  source), or in MRS with Tween 20 (containing C12:0 and C14:0), linoleic, or  supplemented. Bacteria grown in MRS showed the highest storage survival rates. No indications of loss of membrane integrity could be found, and membrane integrity could therefore not be connected with loss of viability. Survival of bacteria grown with linoleic or  was more negatively affected by the presence of , than bacteria grown in MRS or with Tween 20 supplemented. A small, but significant, loss of  during storage could be identified, and an increase of volatile secondary oxidation products during storage was found for bacteria grown in MRS, or with linoleic, or  supplemented, but not for bacteria grown with Tween 20. Overall, the results indicate that lipid oxidation and loss of membrane integrity are not the only or most important detrimental reactions which can occur during storage. By altering the fatty  composition, it was also found that properties of oleic  gave rise to more robust bacteria than more saturated or unsaturated fatty acids did.© 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31475703>Benefits of blended oil consumption over other sources of lipids on the cardiovascular system in obese rats.</a></h2><p>High consumption of cooking oils in modern society is believed to be the major cause of cardiovascular disease. The effect of cooking oils depends on their fatty  composition. Therefore, it is important to blend different types of oils to improve functional properties. In this study we evaluated the effects of a functional blended oil (BO) composed of a high level of oleic  (OA) (50.93%) and α- (ALA) (5.41%) on cardiovascular health, blood pressure (BP) and body weight (BW) in comparison with lard oil (LO) and peanut oil (PO). Ninety male Wistar rats were divided into three groups and fed for 12 weeks with BO, LO and PO. Each group was divided into low, middle and high fat groups and fed with oil supply ratios of 6.7%, 10.9% and 48.1%, respectively. After the feeding period, the rats were sacrificed, and data were collected and analyzed. Rats treated with BO especially at a high dose (HBO) showed a significantly lower body weight, fat weight, liver weight, fat ratio, food intake and energy intake. BO significantly reduced n-6/n-3 levels in plasma, liver and adipose tissues as well as serum triglycerides (TGs) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) but contrarily increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Furthermore, HBO treatments decreased mRNA expression of lipid anabolism-related genes, lipid inflammatory-related genes, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and increased lipid catabolism-related genes as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma mRNA (PPARγ mRNA). In terms of antioxidant enzymes, BO treatment has increased the activity of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) by lowering malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive  species (ROS) in tissues. Moreover, BO supplementation showed a significant lowering effect on the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), blood pressure (BP), atherosclerosis index (AI) and heart rate (HR). These findings highlight that the new blend of canola oil, corn oil, olive oil, peanut oil and sunflower oil with a low n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio of 6 : 1 could prevent and control cardiovascular disease (CVD).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29179543>Effects of Selenite on Unicellular Green Microalga Chlorella pyrenoidosa: Bioaccumulation of Selenium, Enhancement of Photosynthetic Pigments, and Amino  Production.</a></h2><p>Microalgae were studied as function bioaccumulators of selenium (Se) for food and feed supplement. To investigate the bioaccumulation of Se and its effects on the unicellular green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa, the algal growth curve, fluorescence parameters, antioxidant enzyme activity, and fatty  and amino  profiles were examined. We found that Se at low concentrations (≤40 mg L) positively promoted algal growth and inhibited  peroxidation and intracellular reactive oxygen species. The antioxidative effect was associated with an increase in the levels of glutathione peroxidase, catalase, , and photosynthetic pigments. Meanwhile, a significant increase in amino  and organic Se content was also detected in the microalgae. In contrast, we found opposite effects in C. pyrenoidosa exposed to >60 mg L Se. The antioxidation and toxicity appeared to be correlated with the bioaccumulation of excess Se. These results provide a better understanding of the effect of Se on green microalgae, which may help in the development of new technological applications for the production of Se-enriched biomass from microalgae.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21087915>PUFA-dependent alteration of oxidative parameters of a canine mastocytoma cell line.</a></h2><p>Mast cells play a key role in the immune response. Thereby, the balance of oxidative metabolism is of importance in mast cell mediator synthesis and release. Fatty acids may modify mast cell function in several ways. In this study, we investigated the influence of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on oxidative parameters of a canine mastocytoma cell line. C2 cells were cultured in media supplemented with linoleic , arachidonic ,  and eicosapentaenoic , respectively. Production of reactive  species (ROS) as well as lipid peroxides was tested. Furthermore, stressor-induced DNA damage was measured. Exposure of the cells to PUFAs resulted in a significant increase in the synthesis of both ROS and lipid peroxides. Distinct differences between the PUFAs tested underline the impact of the unsaturation degree of fatty acids as well as the position of double bonds on mast cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29315384>Induction of Stress Signaling In Vitro and Suppression of Gonadotropin Secretion by Free Fatty Acids in Female Mouse Gonadotropes.</a></h2><p>An emerging body of evidence supports the concept that the pituitary is a site for integration of multiple physiological and metabolic signals that inform and modulate endocrine pathways. Multiple endocrine mediators of energy balance and adiposity are known to impinge on the neuroendocrine axis regulating reproduction. Observations in humans show that obesity is correlated with decreased gonadotropin secretion, and studies have also suggested that pituitary sensitivity to stimulation by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is decreased in obese individuals. Free fatty acids are a potential mediator of adiposity and energy balance, but their impact as an endocrine modulator of pituitary function has not been closely examined. We evaluated the impact of free fatty acids on a pituitary gonadotrope cell line and in primary pituitary cultures of female mice. We show that increasing physiologically relevant doses of the monounsaturated ω-9 fatty  oleate induces cellular stress and increases production of reactive  species in a mouse gonadotrope cell line. In contrast, the unsaturated ω-3 α- and ω-6 linoleic fatty acids do not have this effect. Additionally, oleate can activate immediate-early gene expression independent of GnRH stimulation but has a negative impact on GnRH induction and expression of the gonadotropin subunit gene Lhb. Further, oleate suppresses gonadotropin secretion in response to pulsatile stimulation by GnRH. These results indicate that free fatty acids can directly alter gonadotropin gene expression and secretion in response to GnRH and may provide a link between energy sensing and reproduction.Copyright © 2018 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18796606>Revealing the catalytic potential of an acyl-ACP desaturase: tandem selective oxidation of saturated fatty acids.</a></h2><p>It is estimated that plants contain thousands of fatty  structures, many of which arise by the action of membrane-bound desaturases and desaturase-like enzymes. The details of "unusual" e.g., hydroxyl or conjugated, fatty  formation remain elusive, because these enzymes await structural characterization. However, soluble plant acyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein) desaturases have been studied in far greater detail but typically only catalyze desaturation (dehydrogenation) reactions. We describe a mutant of the castor acyl-ACP desaturase (T117R/G188L/D280K) that converts stearoyl-ACP into the allylic alcohol trans-isomer (E)-10-18:1-9-OH via a cis isomer (Z)-9-18:1 intermediate. The use of regiospecifically deuterated substrates shows that the conversion of (Z)-9-18:1 substrate to (E)-10-18:1-9-OH product proceeds via hydrogen abstraction at C-11 and highly regioselective hydroxylation (>97%) at C-9. (18)O-labeling studies show that the hydroxyl  in the reaction product is exclusively derived from molecular . The mutant enzyme converts (E)-9-18:1-ACP into two major products, (Z)-10-18:1-9-OH and the conjugated  isomer, (E)-9-(Z)-11-18:2. The observed product profiles can be rationalized by differences in substrate binding as dictated by the curvature of substrate channel at the active site. That three amino  substitutions, remote from the diiron active site, expand the range of reaction outcomes to mimic some of those associated with the membrane-bound desaturase family underscores the latent potential of O(2)-dependent nonheme diiron enzymes to mediate a diversity of functionalization chemistry. In summary, this study contributes detailed mechanistic insights into factors that govern the highly selective production of unusual fatty acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25988762>No positive influence of ingesting chia seed oil on human running performance.</a></h2><p>Runners (n = 24) reported to the laboratory in an overnight fasted state at 8:00 am on two occasions separated by at least two weeks. After providing a blood sample at 8:00 am, subjects ingested 0.5 liters flavored water alone or 0.5 liters water with 7 kcal kg-1 chia seed oil (random order), provided another blood sample at 8:30 am, and then started running to exhaustion (~70% VO2max). Additional blood samples were collected immediately post- and 1-h post-exercise. Despite elevations in plasma  (ALA) during the chia seed oil (337%) versus water trial (35%) (70.8 ± 8.6, 20.3 ± 1.8 μg mL(-1), respectively, p < 0.001), run time to exhaustion did not differ between trials (1.86 ± 0.10, 1.91 ± 0.13 h, p = 0.577, respectively). No trial differences were found for respiratory exchange ratio (RER) (0.92 ± 0.01),  consumption, ventilation, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and plasma glucose and blood lactate. Significant post-run increases were measured for total leukocyte counts, plasma cortisol, and plasma cytokines (Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), Interleukin-10 (IL-10), and Tumor necrosis factors-α (TNF-α)), with no trial differences. Chia seed oil supplementation compared to water alone in overnight fasted runners before and during prolonged, intensive running caused an elevation in plasma ALA, but did not enhance run time to exhaustion, alter RER, or counter elevations in cortisol and inflammatory outcome measures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25143251>An in vitro study reveals the nutraceutical potential of punicic  relevant to diabetes via enhanced GLUT4 expression and adiponectin secretion.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of diabetes and heart diseases is increasing in the world. Nutraceuticals of natural origin are gaining importance as an alternative to modern drugs for the management of metabolic syndrome. In the present study, punicic  (PA), a major bioactive found in pomegranate seed, was subjected for biological characterization with respect to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist property in an in vitro system (3T3-L1 adipocytes). We evaluated the adipogenic potential of various concentrations (5, 10 and 30 μM) of PA by studying triglyceride accumulation and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity in adipocytes, which were found to be increased moderately compared with the positive control, i.e. rosiglitazone (RG). Glucose uptake activity (↑225.93% ± 2.55% for 30 μM of PA), and the prevention of reactive  species (ROS) generation (↓57 ± 1.83% for 30 μM of PA) in adipocytes with PA were also evaluated. We also found that PA increased adiponectin secretion and upregulated GLUT4 expression and translocation in adipocytes. Molecular modelling studies revealed a high binding affinity of PA to the PPARγ ligand binding domain. An in vitro ligand binding assay based on time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) also proved PA as a PPARγ agonist. Finally, we conclude that PA is a potential nutraceutical and should be encouraged for use both as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25372034>Transcriptome sequencing and de novo analysis of cytoplasmic male sterility and maintenance in JA-CMS cotton.</a></h2><p>Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is the failure to produce functional pollen, which is inherited maternally. And it is known that anther development is modulated through complicated interactions between nuclear and mitochondrial genes in sporophytic and gametophytic tissues. However, an unbiased transcriptome sequencing analysis of CMS in cotton is currently lacking in the literature. This study compared differentially expressed (DE) genes of floral buds at the sporogenous cells stage (SS) and microsporocyte stage (MS) (the two most important stages for pollen abortion in JA-CMS) between JA-CMS and its fertile maintainer line JB cotton plants, using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing platform. A total of 709 (1.8%) DE genes including 293 up-regulated and 416 down-regulated genes were identified in JA-CMS line comparing with its maintainer line at the SS stage, and 644 (1.6%) DE genes with 263 up-regulated and 381 down-regulated genes were detected at the MS stage. By comparing the two stages in the same material, there were 8 up-regulated and 9 down-regulated DE genes in JA-CMS line and 29 up-regulated and 9 down-regulated DE genes in JB maintainer line at the MS stage. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to validate 7 randomly selected DE genes. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that genes involved in reduction-oxidation reactions and  metabolism were down-regulated, while genes pertaining to photosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis were up-regulated in JA-CMS floral buds compared with their JB counterparts at the SS and/or MS stages. All these four biological processes play important roles in reactive  species (ROS) homeostasis, which may be an important factor contributing to the sterile trait of JA-CMS. Further experiments are warranted to elucidate molecular mechanisms of these genes that lead to CMS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25190828>Comparative prophylactic effects of α-eleostearic  rich nano and conventional emulsions in induced diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>The present work entailed perspicacious fabrication of Bitter Gourd Seed Oil Nanoemulsion (BGO-NE) for increasing bioavailability of CLnA in oxidative stress induced in vivo system. The BGO-NE was characterized and evaluated for dimensional as well as rheological changes periodically during a 12 week storage period. BGO comprising ∼50 % α-eleostearic , was assessed in conventional and NE formulation at different doses, for its ability to stimulate antioxidative enzyme marker paradigm comprising SOD, GPx, CAT and GSH, inherent to the subjects under study. The formulated BGO-NE (d < 100 nm) was found to be stable for 12 weeks compared to BGO-CE as was determined by particle size characterization and associated parameters. Diet supplementation of 0.5 % (w/v) BGO-NE formulation exhibited maximum efficiency in countering oxidative stress as compared to 1 % BGO-NE formulation and equivalent doses of BGO-CE. Higher efficacy at very low dose of the nano-sized formulation was thus, also established. Histopathological data from liver, pancreas and kidney sections corroborated the above findings. The present study with formulated BGO-NE and BGO-CE evaluates and confirms the implications of a NE formulation of a bioactive lipid - conjugated  (CLnA), targeting specific in vivo processes to counter the negative influence of excess ROS (Reactive  Species) in the system.

However, its application could affect wheat growth. The present study investigates the effect of the ascomycetous fungus Trichoderma harzianum on lipid peroxidation, phospholipids, signaling lipids and phospholipase D in the seedlings of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) treated with 2,4-D (2.5 mg L). In the group of 4-day-old seedlings exposed to the herbicide, increased lipid peroxidation and inhibition of growth were observed in shoots and roots. Moreover, elevated levels of oxylipins were noted. Among them, the amount of 13-HOTrE oxygenated from  (18:3) increased the most significantly. Concurrently, in the seedlings inoculated with T. harzianum, growth was stimulated when the level of phosphatidylcholine (PC) increased. Moreover, in wheat seedlings treated with 2,4-D and T. harzianum, the level of lipid peroxidation was similar to that in the control and there was no increase observed in oxylipins and phospholipase D activity. T. harzianum might have partly alleviated the toxic effect of 2,4-D on wheat seedlings.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

The present study investigated the effects of PFSO on the central nervous system (CNS) and provides new insight into potential mechanisms for protective properties of unsaturated fatty acids within the CNS. PFSO was administered chronically to guinea pigs and neuroprotective properties were assessed ex vivo in dissociated brain cells. Dissociated brain cells isolated from PFSO treated guinea pigs were less vulnerable against nitrosative stress as indicated by decreased levels of reactive  species, by stabilized mitochondrial membrane potential and enhanced levels of adenosine-triphosphate. In the brain, levels of oleic, linoleic, arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids were significantly enhanced. However, fatty  composition and membrane dynamics of isolated synaptosomal plasma membranes were not affected. Our findings provide new insights into the potential mechanisms for the neuroprotective actions of unsaturated fatty acids and identified PFSO as promising nutraceutical and possible alternative to fish oil supplements to provide healthful activities in the brain.2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Pharmacotherapies that moderate inflammation in ARDS are lacking. Several trials have evaluated the effects of pharmaconutrients, given as part of a feeding formula or as a nutritional supplement, on clinical outcomes in critical illness and ARDS.To systematically review and critically appraise available evidence on the effects of immunonutrition compared to standard non-immunonutrition formula feeding on mechanically ventilated adults (aged 18 years or older) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, conference proceedings, and trial registries for appropriate studies up to 25 April 2018. We checked the references from published studies and reviews on this topic for potentially eligible studies.We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing immunonutrition versus a control or placebo nutritional formula in adults (aged 18 years or older) with ARDS, as defined by the Berlin definition of ARDS or, for older studies, by the American-European Consensus Criteria for both ARDS and acute lung injury.Two review authors independently assessed the quality of studies and extracted data from the included trials. We sought additional information from study authors. We performed statistical analysis according to Cochrane methodological standards. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, ventilator days, indices of oxygenation, cardiac adverse events, gastrointestinal adverse events, and total number of adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome.We identified 10 randomized controlled trials with 1015 participants. All studies compared an enteral formula or additional supplemental omega-3 fatty acids (i.e. eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA)), gamma- (GLA), and antioxidants. We assessed some of the included studies as having high risk of bias due to methodological shortcomings. Studies were heterogenous in nature and varied in several ways, including type and duration of interventions given, calorific targets, and reported outcomes. All studies reported mortality. For the primary outcome, study authors reported no differences in all-cause mortality (longest period reported) with the use of an immunonutrition enteral formula or additional supplements of omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants (risk ratio (RR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.07; participants = 1015; studies = 10; low-quality evidence).For secondary outcomes, we are uncertain whether immunonutrition with omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants reduces ICU length of stay (mean difference (MD) -3.09 days. 95% CI -5.19 to -0.99; participants = 639; studies = 8; very low-quality evidence) and ventilator days (MD -2.24 days, 95% CI -3.77 to -0.71; participants = 581; studies = 7; very low-quality evidence). We are also uncertain whether omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants improve oxygenation, defined as ratio of partial pressure of arterial  (PaO₂) to fraction of inspired  (FiO₂), at day 4 (MD 39 mmHg, 95% CI 10.75 to 67.02; participants = 676; studies = 8), or whether they increase adverse events such as cardiac events (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.09 to 8.46; participants = 339; studies = 3; very low-quality evidence), gastrointestinal events (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.75; participants = 427; studies = 4; very low-quality evidence), or total adverse events (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.23; participants = 517; studies = 5; very low-quality evidence).This meta-analysis of 10 studies of varying quality examined effects of omega-3 fatty acids and/or antioxidants in adults with ARDS. This intervention may produce little or no difference in all-cause mortality between groups. We are uncertain whether immunonutrition with omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants improves the duration of ventilator days and ICU length of stay or oxygenation at day 4 due to the very low quality of evidence. Adverse events associated with immunonutrition are also uncertain, as confidence intervals include the potential for increased cardiac, gastrointestinal, and total adverse events.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19951696>Alpha-eleostearic  induces autophagy-dependent cell death through targeting AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 signal together with the generation of reactive  species.</a></h2><p>Alpha-eleostearic  (alpha-ESA, 9Z11E13E-18:3), a  isomer with a conjugated triene system, is a natural and biologically-active compound that has been shown to possess potent anti-tumor properties. Herein, we demonstrate alpha-ESA induced apoptosis and autophagy with reactive  species (ROS) generation in HeLa cells. Treatment with alpha-ESA caused inhibition of phosphorylated (p)AKT and elongated the sub G1 phase in the cell cycle, indicating induction of apoptosis. Autophagy was also induced by alpha-ESA treatment, causing low pAKT and pP70S6K activities, increasing pERK1/2 and leading to a higher conversion rate of LC3 I to LC3 II compared to that of the control. The autophagy was further confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry through monodansylcadavarine (MDC) staining. It appears that the role of autophagy is a protective mechanism against cell death in alpha-ESA-treated HeLa cells. Subsequently, we found that treating HeLa cells with alpha-ESA induced the generation of reactive  species (ROS). The phosphorylation of P70S6K, downstream of mTOR signaling, and AKT were further reduced by pretreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger, whereas the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the conversion of LC3 I to LC3 II were further enhanced. As a result, the blocking of the action of ROS promoted alpha-ESA-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Taken together, our results indicate that the generation of ROS by alpha-ESA treatment impedes the progress of apoptosis and excessive autophagy formation which takes part in cell death, thus impeding death promotion.Copyright 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Since n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), specifically docosahexaenoic  (DHA), alter EGFR signaling and suppress downstream activation of key signaling pathways, we hypothesized that DHA would be detrimental to the process of intestinal wound healing. Using a mouse immortalized colonocyte model, DHA uniquely reduced EGFR ligand-induced receptor activation, whereas DHA and its metabolic precursor eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) reduced wound-induced EGFR transactivation compared with control (no fatty  or linoleic ). Under wounding conditions, the suppression of EGFR activation was associated with a reduction in downstream activation of cytoskeletal remodeling proteins (PLCγ1, Rac1, and Cdc42). Subsequently, DHA and EPA reduced cell migration in response to wounding. Mice were fed a corn oil-, DHA-, or EPA-enriched diet prior to intestinal wounding (2.5% dextran sodium sulfate for 5 days followed by termination after 0, 3, or 6 days of recovery). Mortality was increased in EPA-fed mice and colonic histological injury scores were increased in EPA- and DHA-fed mice compared with corn oil-fed (control) mice. Although kinetics of colonic EGFR activation and downstream signaling (PLCγ1, Rac1, and Cdc42) were delayed by both n-3 PUFA, colonic repair was increased in EPA- relative to DHA-fed mice. These results indicate that, during the early response to intestinal wounding, DHA and EPA uniquely delay the activation of key wound-healing processes in the colon. This effect is mediated, at least in part, via suppression of EGFR-mediated signaling and downstream cytoskeletal remodeling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30760671>Physico-chemical Characterization, Profiling of Total Lipids and Triacylglycerol Molecular Species of Omega-3 Fatty  Rich B. arvensis Seed Oil from India.</a></h2><p>Buglossoides arvensis is indigenous to India and its seed oil is rich in unique and nutritionally important omega-3 fatty  namely, stearidonic  (SDA). It is a non-conventional oil seed plant and needs to be agronomically adapt for commercial utilization. In the present study, oil extracted from the agronomically adapted high yielding cultivar of B. arvensis seeds was analyzed for its oil content, fatty  (FA) composition, physico-chemical characteristics, total lipids and triacylglycerol molecular species. The oil content, peroxide, , iodine, p-anisidine values and tocopherol content of the oil were 18.53% (w/w), 2.06 meq of active  / kg of oil, 2.55 mg KOH/g oil, 217.2 g I/100g oil, 10.7 and 774.8 mg/kg oil respectively. Oxidative stability as determined by the induction period was found to be 3.1 h. Polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) content of the oil was 81.3% (of total FA), comprising of α- (ALA; 48.5%), SDA (18.6%), linoleic  (LA; 10.3%) and γ- (GLA; 3.9%). Profiling of lipid classes showed neutral lipids (89.3%, w/w) as most abundant lipid class followed by glycolipids (7.4%, w/w) and phospholipids (3.3%, w/w). High resolution mass spectrometric analysis of triacylglycerol (TAG) molecular species showed TAGs with C54 carbons in the acyl chain as most abundant. Positional distribution analysis showed GLA and SDA predominantly at the sn-2 position of triacylglycerol. FTIR analysis revealed common characteristics molecular features similar to PUFA rich oils.

In the presence of 20.7 ppm [H2O2] in a 10% mixture of O2 in N2, the effective uptake coefficients of oleic , linoleic  and  are found to be 1.72 ± 0.08, 3.75 ± 0.18 and 5.73 ± 0.14, respectively. These effective uptake coefficients are larger than unity, providing clear evidence for particle-phase secondary chain chemistry. The effective uptake coefficient increases linearly with the number of C=C double bonds in the unsaturated fatty  molecule. Elemental composition analysis reveals that there is an addition of, on average, 0.57 ± 0.02, 0.61 ± 0.01 and 0.73 ± 0.04 O atoms per reactive loss of oleic , linoleic  and , respectively, which suggests that OH addition to the C=C double bond is not the sole reaction pathway that consumes the molecular species. These results suggest the potential presence of secondary reactions that consume the unsaturated fatty  molecular species without increasing the particulate  content. As the unsaturated fatty  particles become more oxygenated, volatilization also becomes significant. The magnitudes of the effective uptake coefficients are found to be dependent on the concentrations of OH, O2 and H2O2 in the flow reactor.

This process generates lipid fragmentation products including malondialdehyde (MDA), an archetypal marker of PUFA oxidation. We observed transient increases in levels of endogenous MDA in wounded Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, raising the possibility that MDA is metabolized. We developed a rigorous ion exchange method to purify enzymatically generated (13)C- and (14)C-MDA. Delivered as a volatile to intact plants, MDA was efficiently incorporated into lipids. Mass spectral and genetic analyses identified the major chloroplast galactolipid: α- (18:3)-7Z,10Z,13Z-hexadecatrienoic  (16:3)-monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (18:3-16:3-MGDG) as an end-product of MDA incorporation. Consistent with this, the fad3-2 fad7-2 fad8 mutant that lacks tri-unsaturated fatty acids incorporated (14)C-MDA into 18:2-16:2-MGDG. Saponification of (14)C-labeled 18:3-16:3-MGDG revealed 84% of (14)C-label in the acyl groups with the remaining 16% in the head group. 18:3-16:3-MGDG is enriched proximal to photosystem II and is likely a major in vivo source of MDA in photosynthetic tissues. We propose that nonenzymatically generated lipid fragments such as MDA are recycled back into plastidic galactolipids that, in their role as cell protectants, can again be fragmented into MDA.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22359349>Reversal of experimental ethanol-induced liver steatosis by borage oil.</a></h2><p>The aim of study was to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of borage oil containing predominantly gamma- in rats with alcoholic steatohepatitis. Liver of ethanol-treated animals was characterized by fatty and hydropic dystrophies. Liver triglyceride contents and activitiies of serum marker enzymes were significantly increased. Ethanol increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH)-induced chemiluminescence and the contents of liver thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS). The reduced glutathione content in the liver was decreased. Ethanol enhanced liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) content, aniline p-hydroxylase and amydopyrine-N-demethylase activities. The treatment with borage oil improved the liver morphology, decreased triglyceride contents and normalized serum marker enzyme activities. Borage oil developed an antioxidant effect in ethanol-treated rats. The treatment with this compound decreased NADPH-induced chemiluminescence and the content of lipid peroxidation products. Borage oil normalized CYP450 content compared with the ethanol-treated group. CYPI450 2E1 isoform is a main source of free  radicals in the liver of ethanol-treated rats and we propose that the antioxidant effect of borage oil is realized via the normalization of CYP450 content and activities of CYP450-related microsomal oxidases, as borage oil can improve the lipid surrounding of CYP450. In our opinion, the hepatoprotection by borage oil in alcoholic steatosis is connected with its antioxidant properties.Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19784538>Effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids on the reactive  and nitrogen species production by raw 264.7 macrophages.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can affect various functions of the immune system including inflammatory responses. An oxidative burst of phagocytes accompanied by reactive  species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) formation is one of the phagocyte functions that could be modulated by PUFAs.To investigate the effects of omega-3 (, docosahexaenoic, eicosapentaenoic) and omega-6 (arachidonic, linoleic) PUFAs on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated ROS and RNS production by the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7.Murine peritoneal macrophages RAW 264.7 were stimulated with LPS (0.1 microg/ml) and treated with 0.1-100 microM omega-3 or omega-6 PUFAs for either 8 (ROS production) or 20 h (RNS production). The cytotoxicity of PUFAs was evaluated by an ATP (adenosine triphosphate) test after both 8 and 20 h of treatment with PUFAs. Changes in ROS production by LPS-treated macrophages subsequently activated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or opsonized zymosan particles (OZP) were determined by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence, whilst the production of RNS was determined as the concentration of nitrites in cell supernatants (Griess reaction). Changes in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression were evaluated by Western blot analysis. The antioxidant properties of PUFAs were tested by TRAP (total peroxyl radical-trapping antioxidant parameter) assay.All PUFAs in 100 microM concentration except eicosapentaenoic  decreased ROS production. The effect was most significant when docosahexaenoic  was used. Arachidonic  decreased PMA-activated ROS production even in 1 and 10 microM concentrations. On the other hand, 10 and 100 microM eicosapentaenoic  potentiated ROS production. As concerns RNS production, all the fatty acids that were tested in a concentration of 100 microM decreased iNOS expression and nitrite accumulation. Fatty acids had no significant effect on the viability and proliferation of RAW 264.7 cells. The TRAP assay confirmed that none of the tested PUFAs exerted any significant antioxidant properties.High concentrations of PUFAs of both omega-3 and omega-6 groups can inhibit ROS and RNS formation by stimulated macrophages. The expression of iNOS can also be inhibited. This effect, together with the absence of antioxidant activity and cytotoxic properties, indicates that PUFAs can participate in the regulation of enzymes responsible for reactive species production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24043219>UVA irradiation of fatty acids and their oxidized products substantially increases their ability to generate singlet .</a></h2><p>UVA radiation plays an important role for adverse reactions in human tissue. UVA penetrates epidermis and dermis of skin being absorbed by various biomolecules, especially endogenous photosensitizers. This may generate deleterious singlet  ((1)O2) that oxidizes fatty acids in cell membranes, lipoproteins, and other lipid-containing structures such as the epidermal barrier. Indications exist that fatty acids are not only the target of (1)O2 but also act as potential photosensitizers under UVA irradiation, if already oxidized. Five different fatty acids in ethanol solution (stearic, oleic, linoleic,  and arachidonic ) were exposed to UVA radiation (355 nm, 100 mW) for 30 seconds. (1)O2 luminescence was detected time-resolved at 1270 nm and confirmed in spectrally-resolved experiments. The more double bonds fatty acids have the more (1)O2 photons were detected. In addition, fatty acids were continuously exposed to broadband UVA for up to 240 min. During that time span, UVA absorption and (1)O2 luminescence substantially increased with irradiation time, reached a maximum and decreased again. HPLC-MS analysis showed that the amount of peroxidized fatty acids and the (1)O2 generation increased and decreased in parallel. This indicates the high potential of peroxidized fatty acids to produce (1)O2 under UVA irradiation. In conclusion, fatty acids along with peroxidized products are weak endogenous photosensitizers but become strong photosensitizers under continuous UVA irradiation. Since fatty acids and their oxidized products are ubiquitous in living cells and in skin, which is frequently and long-lasting exposed to UVA radiation, this photosensitizing effect may contribute to initiation of deleterious photooxidative processes in tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28520897> protects the developmental capacity of bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes matured under lipotoxic conditions in vitro.</a></h2><p>Elevated concentrations of free fatty acids (FFAs), predominantly palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids (PSO), exert detrimental effects on oocyte developmental competence. This study examined the effects of omega-3  (ALA) during in vitro oocyte maturation (IVM) in the presence of PSO on subsequent embryo development and quality, and the cellular mechanisms that might be involved. Bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were supplemented during IVM with ALA (50 μM), PSO (425 μM), or PSO+ALA. Compared with FFA-free controls (P < 0.05), PSO increased embryo fragmentation and decreased good quality embryos on day 2 postfertilization. Day 7 blastocyst rate was also reduced. Day 8 blastocysts had lower cell counts and higher apoptosis but normal metabolic profile. In the PSO group, cumulus cell (CC) expansion was inhibited with an increased CC apoptosis while COC metabolism was not affected. Mitochondrial inner membrane potential (MMP; JC-1 staining) was reduced in the CCs and oocytes. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) but not glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78, known as BiP; an endoplasmic reticulum stress marker) was upregulated in the CCs. Higher reactive oxygen species levels (DCHFDA staining) were detected in the oocytes. In contrast, adding ALA in the presence of PSO normalized embryo fragmentation, cleavage, blastocyst rates, and blastocyst quality compared to controls (P > 0.05). Combined treatment with ALA also reduced CC apoptosis, partially recovered CC expansion, abrogated the reduction in MMP in the CCs but not in the oocytes, and reduced BiP and HSP70 expression in CCs, compared with PSO only (P < 0.05). In conclusion, ALA supplementation protected oocyte developmental capacity under lipotoxic conditions mainly by protecting cumulus cell viability.© The Authors 2017.

UVB is well absorbed in proteins and DNA leading to products such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. In contrast, UVA radiation generates reactive  species such as singlet , which can initiate a variety of cellular damages and cellular signalling. It was the goal to investigate whether and to which extent UVB radiation is additionally able to cause oxidative damages via singlet . Potential endogenous photosensitizers such as vitamin B molecules or unsaturated fatty acids were irradiated in solution using monochromatic UVB radiation at 308 nm. Singlet  was directly detected and quantified by its luminescence at 1270 nm. All investigated endogenous photosensitizers showed clear singlet  signals with a quantum yield ranging from 5 to 40%. UVB radiation altered the photosensitizer molecules during irradiation yielding a change of absorption in the entire ultraviolet spectrum (280-400 nm). UVB irradiation of endogenous photosensitizers produced singlet  that in turn changes the absorption of those molecules. Being an important prerequisite, the changed absorption may either reduce or increase singlet  production. An increase in singlet  generation may initiate a vicious cycle that has the potential to amplify UVB- or UVA-mediated effects in skin cells.© 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29481633>Fatty  addition and thermotolerance of Kluyveromyces marxianus.</a></h2><p>Membrane fatty  composition has an important role in yeast stress resistance, particularly in temperature tolerance. Most studies investigating temperature and membrane fatty acids use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae without considering other yeasts, such as Kluyveromyces marxianus, which has physiological differences and industrial advantages with respect to S. cerevisiae. One of the primary traits of K. marxianus is its thermotolerance. The effect of fatty  addition (oleic , linoleic ,  and araquidic ) on the thermotolerance of the K. marxianus strain SLP1 was evaluated. SLP1 yeast exhibited temperature tolerance of up to 50°C; at 55°C, viability was reduced significantly, probably due to an increase in the generation of reactive  chemical species. Externally added fatty acids were incorporated in the yeast membrane, increasing their proportion to approximately 70%, thereby changing membrane fluidity. SLP1 cells supplemented with polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased cell thermotolerance and increased the degree of lipoperoxidation, while arachidic  addition exhibited a tendency to increase yeast thermotolerance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23788031>Eleostearic  induces RIP1-mediated atypical apoptosis in a kinase-independent manner via ERK phosphorylation, ROS generation and mitochondrial dysfunction.</a></h2><p>RIP1 is a serine/threonine kinase, which is involved in apoptosis and necroptosis. In apoptosis, caspase-8 and FADD have an important role. On the other hand, RIP3 is a key molecule in necroptosis. Recently, we reported that eleostearic  (ESA) elicits caspase-3- and PARP-1-independent cell death, although ESA-treated cells mediate typical apoptotic morphology such as chromatin condensation, plasma membrane blebbing and apoptotic body formation. The activation of caspases, Bax and PARP-1, the cleavage of AIF and the phosphorylation of histone H2AX, all of which are characteristics of typical apoptosis, do not occur in ESA-treated cells. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. To clarify the signaling pathways in ESA-mediated apoptosis, we investigated the functions of RIP1, MEK, ERK, as well as AIF. Using an extensive study based on molecular biology, we identified the alternative role of RIP1 in ESA-mediated apoptosis. ESA mediates RIP1-dependent apoptosis in a kinase independent manner. ESA activates serine/threonine phosphatases such as calcineurin, which induces RIP1 dephosphorylation, thereby ERK pathway is activated. Consequently, localization of AIF and ERK in the nucleus, ROS generation and ATP reduction in mitochondria are induced to disrupt mitochondrial cristae, which leads to cell death. Necrostatin (Nec)-1 blocked MEK/ERK phosphorylation and ESA-mediated apoptosis. Nec-1 inactive form (Nec1i) also impaired ESA-mediated apoptosis. Nec1 blocked the interaction of MEK with ERK upon ESA stimulation. Together, these findings provide a new finding that ERK and kinase-independent RIP1 proteins are implicated in atypical ESA-mediated apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374913>Goats' Feeding Supplementation with  Pods and Their Relationship with Milk Composition: Fatty Acids, Polyphenols, and Antioxidant Activity.</a></h2><p>Research efforts have focused on the evaluation of the bioactive quality of animal products (milk, cheese, meat, and other by-products) contrasting various feeding strategies coming from different ecological zones. The study aimed to describe the fatty acids (FA), polyphenols (P), bioactive compounds (BC), and antioxidant activity (AA) of goat's milk.Dairy goats were fed with five systems: (1) Grazing; (2) conventional diet (CD); (3) CD + 10% of  (AF) pods; (4) CD + 20% AF; and (5) CD + 30% AF. The fatty  profile, health promoting and thrombogenic indexes were calculated. Milk extracts were evaluated by HPLC to determent phenolic compounds (gallic, caffeic, chlorogenic, and ferulic acids, catechin, epicatechin, and quercetin). Antioxidant activity of goat's milk extract was evaluated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH•),  radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays.Conventional diet showed the highest content of polyunsaturated fatty acids while grazing showed the best n-6:n-3 and the linoleic: ratio. Similarly, grazing and AF boosted the polyphenol content. inclusion in the goats' diets increased the presence of bioactive compounds and the antioxidant activity while diminishing the cholesterol content of goat's milk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572579>New Lipophenol Antioxidants Reduce Oxidative Damage in Retina Pigment Epithelial Cells.</a></h2><p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a multifactorial pathology and its progression is exacerbated by oxidative stress. Oxidation and photo-oxidation reactions modify lipids in retinal cells, contribute to tissue injury, and lead to the formation of toxic adducts. In particular, autofluorescent pigments such as -retinylidene--retinylethanolamine (A2E) accumulate as lipofuscin in retinal pigment epithelial cells, contribute to the production of additional reactive  species (ROS), and lead to cell degeneration. In an effort to develop efficient antioxidants to reduce damage caused by lipid oxidation, various natural polyphenols were structurally modified to increase their lipophilicity (lipophenols). In this study, resveratrol, phloroglucinol, quercetin and catechin were selected and conjugated to various polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) using classical chemical strategies or enzymatic reactions. After screening for cytotoxicity, the capacity of the synthesized lipophenols to reduce ROS production was evaluated in ARPE-19 cells subjected to H₂O₂ treatment using a dichlorofluorescein diacetate probe. The positions of the PUFA on the polyphenol core appear to influence the antioxidant effect. In addition, two lipophenolic quercetin derivatives were evaluated to highlight their potency in protecting ARPE-19 cells against A2E photo-oxidation toxicity. Quercetin conjugated to linoleic or α- were promising lipophilic antioxidants, as they protected ARPE-19 cells from A2E-induced cell death more effectively than the parent polyphenol, quercetin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19927275>The novel ruthenium-gamma- complex [Ru(2)(aGLA)(4)Cl] inhibits C6 rat glioma cell proliferation and induces changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, increased reactive  species generation and apoptosis in vitro.</a></h2><p>The present study reports the synthesis of a novel compound with the formula [Ru(2)(aGLA)4Cl] according to elemental analyses data, referred to as Ru(2)GLA. The electronic spectra of Ru(2)GLA is typical of a mixed valent diruthenium(II,III) carboxylate. Ru(2)GLA was synthesized with the aim of combining and possibly improving the anti-tumour properties of the two active components ruthenium and gamma- (GLA). The properties of Ru(2)GLA were tested in C6 rat glioma cells by analysing cell number, viability, lipid droplet formation, apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive  species. Ru(2)GLA inhibited cell proliferation in a time and concentration dependent manner. Nile Red staining suggested that Ru(2)GLA enters the cells and ICP-AES elemental analysis found an increase in ruthenium from <0.02 to 425 mg/Kg in treated cells. The sub-G1 apoptotic cell population was increased by Ru(2)GLA (22 +/- 5.2%) when analysed by FACS and this was confirmed by Hoechst staining of nuclei. Mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased in the presence of Ru(2)GLA (44 +/- 2.3%). In contrast, the cells which maintained a high mitochondrial membrane potential had an increase (18 +/- 1.5%) in reactive  species generation. Both decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased reactive  species generation may be involved in triggering apoptosis in Ru(2)GLA exposed cells. The EC(50) for Ru(2)GLA decreased with increasing time of exposure from 285 microM at 24 h, 211 microM at 48 h to 81 microM at 72 h. In conclusion, Ru(2)GLA is a novel drug with antiproliferative properties in C6 glioma cells and is a potential candidate for novel therapies in gliomas.2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25559239>Plasma phospholipids, non-esterified plasma polyunsaturated fatty acids and oxylipids are associated with BMI.</a></h2><p>The obese lipid profile is associated with increased free fatty acids and triacylglycerides. Currently, little is known about the plasma lipid species associated with obesity. In this study, we compared plasma lipid fatty  (FA) profiles as a function of BMI. Profiling phospholipid (PL) FAs and their respective oxylipids could predict which obese individuals are more likely to suffer from diseases associated with chronic inflammation or oxidative stress. We investigated the relationship between BMI and plasma PL (PPL) FA composition in 126 men using a quantitative gas chromatography analysis. BMI was inversely associated with both PPL nervonic and linoleic  (LA) but was positively associated with both dihomo-γ- and palmitoleic . Compared to lean individuals, obese participants were more likely to have ω-6 FAs, except arachidonic  and LA, incorporated into PPLs. Obese participants were less likely to have EPA and DHA incorporated into PPLs compared to lean participants. Non-esterified plasma PUFA and oxylipid analysis showed ω-6 oxylipids were more abundant in the obese plasma pool. These ω-6 oxylipids are associated with increased angiogenesis (i.e. epoxyeicosatrienoates), reactive  species (i.e. 9-hydroxyeicosatetraenoate), and inflammation resolution (i.e. Lipoxin A4). In summary, BMI is directly associated with specific PPL FA and increased ω-6 oxylipids.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The human HCC cell line HuH7 was exposed to GLA. Cell proliferation and reactive  species (ROS) generation including lipid peroxidation and apoptosis were compared. We then used a cDNA microarray analysis to investigate the molecular changes induced by GLA. GLA treatment significantly reduced cell proliferation, generated ROS, and induced apoptosis. After 24 h exposure of Huh7 cells to GLA, we identified several genes encoding the antioxidant proteins to be upregulated: heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), aldo-keto reductase 1 family C1 (AKR1C1), C4 (AKR1C4), and thioredoxin (Trx). The HO-1 protein levels were overexpressed in Huh7 cells after GLA exposure using a Western blot analysis. Furthermore, chromium mesoporphyrin (CrMP), an inhibitor of HO activity, significantly potentiated GLA cytotoxicity. GLA treatment has induced cell growth inhibition, ROS generation including lipid peroxidation, and HO-1 production for antioxidant protection against oxidative stress caused by GLA in Huh7 cells.

Upon infection with the necrotroph Botrytis cinerea, several defence mechanisms are induced in P. patens, including the fortification of the plant cell wall by the incorporation of phenolic compounds and the induced expression of related genes. Botrytis cinerea infection also activates the accumulation of reactive  species and cell death with hallmarks of programmed cell death in moss tissues. Salicylic  (SA) levels also increase after fungal infection, and treatment with SA enhances transcript accumulation of the defence gene phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) in P. patens colonies. The expression levels of the genes involved in 12-oxo-phytodienoic  (OPDA) synthesis, including lipoxygenase (LOX) and allene oxide synthase (AOS), increase in P. patens gametophytes after pathogen assault, together with a rise in free  and OPDA concentrations. However, jasmonic  (JA) could not be detected in healthy or infected tissues of this plant. Our results suggest that, although conserved defence signals, such as SA and OPDA, are synthesized and are probably involved in the defence response of P. patens against B. cinerea infection, JA production appears to be missing. Interestingly, P. patens responds to OPDA and methyl jasmonate by reducing moss colony growth and rhizoid length, suggesting that jasmonate perception is present in mosses. Thus, P. patens can provide clues with regard to the evolution of different defence pathways in plants, including signalling and perception of OPDA and jasmonates in nonflowering and flowering plants.© 2012 THE AUTHORS.

It is initiated by free  radical-induced abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the lipid molecule followed by a series of nonenzymatic reactions that ultimately generate the reactive aldehyde species 4-hydroxyalkenals. The molecule 4-hydroxy-2E-hexenal (4-HHE) is generated by peroxidation of n-3 PUFAs, such as , eicosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic . The aldehyde product 4-hydroxy-2E-nonenal (4-HNE) is the peroxidation product of n-6 PUFAs, such as arachidonic and linoleic acids and their 15-lipoxygenase metabolites, namely 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HpETE) and 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic  (13-HpODE). Another reactive peroxidation product is 4-hydroxy-2E,6Z-dodecadienal (4-HDDE), which is derived from 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic  (12-HpETE), the 12-lipoxygenase metabolite of arachidonic . Hydroxyalkenals, notably 4-HNE, have been implicated in various pathophysiological interactions due to their chemical reactivity and the formation of covalent adducts with macromolecules. The progressive accumulation of these adducts alters normal cell functions that can lead to cell death. The lipophilicity of these aldehydes positively correlates to their chemical reactivity. Nonetheless, at low and noncytotoxic concentrations, these molecules may function as signaling molecules in cells. This has been shown mostly for 4-HNE and to some extent for 4-HHE. The capacity of 4-HDDE to generate such "mixed signals" in cells has received less attention.

Homogeneity of beta-turmerin was confirmed by its movement as single band both in SDS-PAGE and as well as in native (basic) PAGE. The apparent molecular mass is approximately 34 kDa by SDS-PAGE. It is more hydrophobic protein and showed sharp single peak in RP-HPLC with retention time of 62.17 min. It is a glycoprotein as it shows the presence of amino sugars up to 0.021 gm%. In three different model systems i.e.,  micelles, erythrocyte membrane systems and liposomes, beta-turmerin at 0.125 microM offered 70%, 64%, and 60% inhibition of lipid peroxidation, which is 3200 times more efficient than the standard antioxidants BHA (400 microM) and alpha-tocopherol (400 microM). beta-turmerin inhibited diene-triene and tetraene conjugation up to 54%, 72% and 47%, respectively. beta-turmerin also effectively scavenges hydroxyl radicals when compared to BHA and alpha-tocopherol. beta-turmerin (2.5 microM) further inhibited the activation of PMNL mediated by fMLP up to the extent of 75%, where as standards BHA (400 microM) and mannitol (10 microM) inhibited the same to 65% and 55%, respectively. At 0.125 microM dose beta-turmerin prevented t-BOOH induced cell death at all time intervals. In addition to the above properties, it is non-toxic to lymphocytes as it did not affect the viability of cells. The mechanism of antioxidant action of beta-turmerin could probably be by counteracting/quenching of reactive  species (ROS).

First generation of rats born and maintained under supplementation with soybean-oil (SO), fish-oil (FO) or hydrogenated-vegetable-fat (HVF), which are rich in n-6, n-3 and trans (TFA) FA, respectively, until adulthood, were exposed to an amphetamine (AMPH)-induced mania animal model to behavioral and biochemical evaluations. While AMPH caused hyperlocomotion in HVF and, to a less extent, in SO- and FO-groups, a better memory performance was observed in FO group. Among vehicle-groups, HVF increased reactive species (RS) generation and protein-carbonyl (PC) levels in cortex; FO reduced RS generation in hippocampus and decreased PC levels in hippocampus and striatum. Among AMPH-treated animals, HVF exacerbated RS generation in all evaluated brain areas and increased PC levels in cortex and striatum; FO reduced RS generation in hippocampus and decreased PC levels in hippocampus and striatum. FO was related to higher percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) in cortex and striatum, while HVF was associated to higher incorporation of TFA in cortex, hippocampus and striatum, besides increased n-6/n-3 FA ratio in striatum. While a continuous exposure to TFA may intensify oxidative events in brain, a prolonged FO consumption may prevent mania-like-behavior; enhance memory besides decreasing brain oxidative markers. A substantial inclusion of processed foods, instead of foods rich in omega-3, in the long term is able to influence the functionality of brain structures related to behavioral disturbances and weaker neuroprotection, whose impact should be considered by food safety authorities and psychiatry experts.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Here we exposed bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells and human platelets to variable glucose and fatty  concentrations. We then examined  consumption and acidification rates using recently available technology in the form of an extracellular  and proton flux analyzer. Acute or overnight exposure of confluent BAE cells to glucose concentrations from 5.5 to 25 mM did not enhance or change the rate of  consumption (OCR) under basal conditions, during ATP synthesis, or under uncoupled conditions. Glucose also did not alter OCR in sub-confluent cells, in cells exposed to low serum, or in cells treated with added pyruvate. Likewise, overnight exposure to fatty acids of varying saturation had no such effects. Overnight exposure of BAE cells to low glucose concentration decreased maximal uncoupled respiration, but not basal or ATP related  consumption. Labeled glucose oxidation to CO(2) increased, but only marginally after high glucose exposure while oleate oxidation to CO(2) decreased. Overnight exposure to , but not oleic or linoleic  increased extracellular acidification consistent with enhanced glycolytic metabolism. We were unable to detect an increase in production of reactive  species (ROS) from BAE cells exposed to high medium glucose. Like BAE cells, exposure of human platelets to glucose did not increase  consumption. As opposed to BAE cells, platelet mitochondria demonstrate less respiratory reserve capacity (beyond that needed for basal metabolism).

This study aims at demonstrating the in vitro anti-tumor effect and action mechanisms of jacaric , a CLN isomer which is present in jacaranda seed oil, on the murine macrophage-like leukemia PU5-1.8 cells.It was found that jacaric  inhibited the proliferation of PU5-1.8 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, as determined by the MTT reduction assay and by using CyQUANT(®) NF Cell Proliferation Assay Kit, while it exerted minimal cytotoxicity on normal murine cells. Besides, the reactive  species production in jacaric -treated PU5-1.8 cells was elevated in a concentration-dependent mannar. Flow cytometric analysis revealed the induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, accompanied by a decrease in CDK2 and cyclin E proteins. Jacaric  also triggered apoptosis as reflected by induction of DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine externalization, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, up-regulation of pro-apoptotic Bax protein and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins.Our results demonstrated the growth-inhibitory effect of jacaric  on PU5-1.8 cells through inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, while exhibiting minimal cytotoxicity to normal murine cells. Therefore, jacaric  is a potential candidate for the treatment of some forms of myeloid leukemia with minimal toxicity and fewer side effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26363928>ω-6 (18:2) and ω-3 (18:3) fatty acids in reconstituted high-density lipoproteins show different functionality of anti-atherosclerotic properties and embryo toxicity.</a></h2><p>Among unsaturated fatty acids, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that ω-6 (linoleic ) and ω-3 () fatty acids show different associations with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), although its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. To determine why consumption of ω-3 fatty  is associated with lower risk of CVD, we investigated the biological functions of ω-6 (linoleic ) and ω-3 () in reconstituted HDL (rHDL) after encapsulation using human cells and zebrafish embryo. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is the principal protein behind the beneficial functions of HDL, which include potent anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-atherosclerotic activities in blood. Several rHDLs were synthesized with apoA-I and different molar ratio of ω-6 or ω-3 fatty . Both fatty acids showed similar solubility in rHDL up to a molar ratio of 95:5:1:10 (palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol:apoA-I:fatty ). Although both rHDL showed similar structural properties and α-helical contents, ω-6-rHDL showed loss of anti-oxidant ability against LDL oxidation. Uptake of acetylated LDL into macrophages was inhibited by ω-3-rHDL but not ω-6-rHDL, suggesting that ω-6-rHDL has higher pro-atherosclerotic activity. ω-3-rHDL showed more enhanced cholesterol efflux activity with less accumulation of triglyceride in the macrophage. ω-6-rHDL caused more senescence in human dermal fibroblast cells with cytotoxicity, while ω-3-rHDL treatment inhibited the senescence. In zebrafish embryo survivability, ω-3-rHDL-injected embryos showed 86±3% survival, whereas ω-6-rHDL-injected ones showed 72±2% survival as well as an elevated inflammatory response in zebrafish embryos. In conclusion, ω-6-rHDL and ω-3-rHDL show different physiological activities in atherosclerosis, inflammation, and cellular senescence.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The JA-independent roles of TFAs were investigated by comparing the TFA- and JA-deficient fatty  desaturase triple mutant (fad3-2 fad7-2 fad8 (fad3 fad7 fad8)) with the aos (allene oxide synthase) mutant that contains TFAs but is JA-deficient. When challenged with the fungus Botrytis, resistance of the fad3 fad7 fad8 mutant was reduced when compared with the aos mutant, suggesting that TFAs play a role in cell survival independently of being the precursors of JA. An independent genetic approach using the lesion mimic mutant accelerated cell death2 (acd2-2) confirmed the importance of TFAs in containing lesion spread, which was increased in the lines in which the fad3 fad7 fad8 and acd2-2 mutations were combined when compared with the aos acd2-2 lines. Malondialdehyde, found to result from oxidative TFA fragmentation during lesion formation, was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Its levels correlated with the survival of the tissue. Furthermore, plants lacking TFAs overproduced salicylic  (SA), hydrogen peroxide, and transcripts encoding several SA-regulated and SA biosynthetic proteins. The data suggest a physiological role for TFAs as sinks for reactive  species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23072474>Nontargeted metabolite profiling in compatible pathogen-inoculated tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv.

To characterize the response of tobacco to biphasically produced ROS concerning the propagation of Ppn, ultraperformance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight/ mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) based metabolic profiling combined with multivariate statistical analysis was performed. Among the nonredundant 355 mass ions in ESI+ mode and 345 mass ions in ESI- mode that were selected as significantly changed by Ppn inoculation (|p(corr)| > 0.6 on S-plot of orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), fold-change > 2, and p < 0.05 in the independent two-sample t test), 76 mass ions were identified on the basis of their accurate mass ions and MS/MS spectra. Phenolic amino acids, phenylpropanoids, hydroxycinnamic  amides, linoleic , , lysophospholipids, glycoglycerolipids, and trioxidized phospholipids were identified as having changed after Ppn inoculation.

The contents of ROS of LLC-PK1 in the persistent intervention group were lower than those in the positive control group when the concentration of ALA were from 10 micromol/L to 100 micromol/L (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The contents of ROS of LLC-PK1 in the preconditioning group were lower than those in the positive control group when the concentration of ALA was 50 micromol/L (P < 0.05).The model of LLC-PK1 induced by high glucose provided fine chances for the intervention of renal tubular epithelial cells in DN.

Wide dispersion of each of TAA(AA), TAA(LA), TEAC, TGSH, and SOD occurred within bacterial groups, indicating that antioxidative properties are strain specific. The strains Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DSMZ 23032, Lactobacillus acidophilus DSMZ 23033, and Lactobacillus brevis DSMZ 23034 exhibited among the highest TAA(AA), TAA(LA), TEAC, and TGSH values within the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. These strains were used to prepare a potentially antioxidative probiotic formulation, which was administered to rats at the dose of 10(7), 10(8), and 10(9) cfu/day for 18 days. The probiotic strains colonized the colon of the rats during the trial and promoted intestinal saccharolytic metabolism. The analysis of plasma antioxidant activity, reactive  molecules level, and glutathione concentration, revealed that, when administered at doses of at least 10(8) cfu/day, the antioxidant mixture effectively reduced doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress. Probiotic strains which are capable to limit excessive amounts of reactive radicals in vivo may contribute to prevent and control several diseases associated with oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24100086>Cloning and functional analysis of HpFAD2 and HpFAD3 genes encoding Δ12- and Δ15-fatty  desaturases in Hansenula polymorpha.</a></h2><p>Two fatty  desaturase genes have been cloned: HpFAD2 and HpFAD3 encode Hansenula polymorpha Δ12-fatty  desaturase (HpFad2) and Δ15-fatty  desaturase (HpFad3), which are responsible for the production of linoleic  (LA, C18:2, Δ9, Δ12) and α- (ALA, αC18:3, Δ9, Δ12, Δ15), respectively. The open reading frame of the HpFAD2 and HpFAD3 genes is 1215bp and 1239bp, encoding 405 and 413 amino acids, respectively. The putative amino  sequences of HpFad2 and HpFad3 share more than 60% similarity and three conserved histidine-box motifs with other known yeast Fad homologs. Hpfad2Δ disruptant cannot produce C18:2 and αC18:3, while the deletion of HpFAD3 only causes the absence of αC18:3. Heterologous expression of either the HpFAD2 or the HpFAD3 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in the presence of C18:2 and αC18:3 when the C18:2 precursor was added. Taken together, these observations indicate that HpFAD2 and HpFAD3 indeed encode Δ12- and Δ15-fatty  desaturases that function as the only ones responsible for desaturation of oleic  (C18:1) and linoleic  (C18:2), respectively, in H. polymorpha. Because a Fatty  Regulated (FAR) region and a Low  Response Element (LORE), which are responsible for regulation of a Δ9-fatty  desaturase gene (ScOLE1) in S. cerevisiae, are present in the upstream regions of both genes, we investigated whether the transcriptional levels of HpFAD2 and HpFAD3 are affected by supplementation with nutrient unsaturated fatty acids or by low  conditions. Whereas both genes were up-regulated under low  conditions, only HpFAD3 transcription was repressed by an excess of C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3, while the HpFAD2 transcript level did not significantly change. These observations indicate that HpFAD2 expression is not controlled at the transcriptional level by fatty acids even though it contains a FAR-like region. This study indicates that HpFAD2 may be regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms, whereas HpFAD3 may be mainly controlled at a transcriptional level.© 2013.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25153536>Serum metabolites from walnut-fed aged rats attenuate stress-induced neurotoxicity in BV-2 microglial cells.</a></h2><p>The shift in equilibrium towards excess reactive  or nitrogen species production from innate antioxidant defenses in brain is a critical factor in the declining neural function and cognitive deficit accompanying age. Previous studies from our laboratory have reported that walnuts, rich in polyphenols, antioxidants, and omega fatty acids such as  and linoleic , improve the age-associated declines in cognition and neural function in rats. Possible mechanisms of action of these effects include enhancing protective signaling, altering membrane microstructures, decreasing inflammation, and preventing accumulation of polyubiquitinated protein aggregates in critical regions of the brain. In the current study, we investigated whether the serum collected from aged animals fed with walnut diets (0, 6, and 9%, w/w) would enhance protection on stressed BV-2 microglia in vitro. In the growth medium, fetal bovine serum was substituted with the serum collected from 22-month-old rats fed per protocol for 12 weeks. Walnut diet serum (6 and 9%) significantly attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced nitrite release compared to untreated control cells and those treated with serum from rats fed 0% walnut diets. The results also indicated a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor-alpha, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. These results suggest antioxidant and anti-inflammatory protection or enhancement of membrane-associated functions in brain cells by walnut serum metabolites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29456586>Dietary canolol protects the heart against the deleterious effects induced by the association of rapeseed oil, vitamin E and coenzyme Q10 in the context of a high- diet.</a></h2><p>Obesity progressively leads to cardiac failure. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been shown to have cardio-protective effects in numerous pathological situations. It is not known whether rapeseed oil, which contains α- (ALA), has a similar protective effect. Omega-3 PUFAs are sensitive to attack by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and  peroxidation products could damage cardiac cells. We thus tested whether dietary refined rapeseed oil (RSO) associated with or without different antioxidants (vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 and canolol) is cardio-protective in a situation of abdominal obesity.Sixty male Wistar rats were subdivided into 5 groups. Each group was fed a specific diet for 11 weeks: a low- diet (3% of lipids, C diet) with compositionally-balanced PUFAs; a high- diet rich in palm oil (30% of lipids, PS diet); the PS diet in which 40% of lipids were replaced by RSO (R diet); the R diet supplemented with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and vitamin E (RTC diet); and the RTC diet supplemented with canolol (RTCC diet). At the end of the diet period, the rats were sacrificed and the heart was collected and immediately frozen. Fatty  composition of cardiac phospholipids was then determined. Several features of cardiac function (fibrosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, , mitochondrial biogenesis) were also estimated.Abdominal obesity reduced cardiac oxidative stress and apoptosis rate by increasing the proportion of arachidonic  (AA) in membrane phospholipids. Dietary RSO had the same effect, though it normalized the proportion of AA. Adding vitamin E and CoQ10 in the RSO-rich high  diet had a deleterious effect, increasing fibrosis by increasing angiotensin-2 receptor-1b (Ag2R-1b) mRNA expression. Overexpression of these receptors triggers coronary vasoconstriction, which probably induced ischemia. Canolol supplementation counteracted this deleterious effect by reducing coronary vasoconstriction.Canolol was found to counteract the fibrotic effects of vitamin E + CoQ10 on cardiac fibrosis in the context of a high- diet enriched with RSO. This effect occurred through a restoration of cardiac Ag2R-1b mRNA expression and decreased ischemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18480973>Application of response surface method for studying the role of dissolved  and agitation speed on gamma- production.</a></h2><p>To study the effect of agitation speed (rpm) and dissolved  concentration (DO) on the production of gamma  by Mucor sp. RRL001, a central composite design experiment was performed in a 5-L stirred tank bioreactor. The design consisted of a total of 10 runs consisting of runs at five levels for each factor and was divided in two blocks. The ANOVA analysis and Pareto chart of effects suggested agitation speed (p = 0.0142) linear effect and DO concentration (p = 0.0342) quadratic effects were significant factors with significant contribution to the response. The validation run based on the optimum production zone in response surface plot resulted in the maximum 350.3 mg l(-1) GLA yield as compared with model predicted value of 340.7 mg l(-1). The study suggests that agitation rate is having more pronounced effect on GLA yield than dissolved  concentration by ensuring enhanced mass transfer and by preventing wall growth at elevated agitation speed. Also, it shows that higher GLA yields can be obtained in a simple medium at moderate  saturation and that the Mucor sp. RRL001 is resistant to high agitation linked shear stress and suitable for GLA production at higher scale.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25854630>Augmentation of water-holding and textural properties of breast meat from oxidatively stressed broilers by dietary antioxidant regimens.</a></h2><p>1. The impact of dietary antioxidants and degree of oil oxidation on textural attributes of chicken broiler breast meat stored in -enriched, air-permeable polyvinylchloride and skin packaging systems during retail display at 2-4°C for up to 21 d was assessed. 2. Broilers were fed on diets either with a low-oxidised oil (peroxide 23 mEq O2/kg) or with a high-oxidised oil (peroxide 121 mEq O2/kg), with or without an algae-based antioxidant and organic mineral antioxidant supplement for 42 d. 3. Fatty acids and radical scavenging activities of the diets were estimated. Meat colour, pH, myofibrillar protein profile and textural traits were measured. 4. Diets with high-oxidised oil reduced stearic, linoleic and  content compared to low-oxidised oil samples, regardless of antioxidant supplementation. Meat colour and pH varied among dietary treatments throughout storage. Meat samples from the antioxidant dietary group, irrespective of oil oxidation level, had lower amounts of purge and cooking losses compared to the unsupplemented diets. For all packaging systems, meat shear force was significantly higher for broilers fed on high-oxidised diets. 5. The results demonstrate that dietary antioxidant supplementation can minimise the negative impact of oxidised oil on the quality of broiler meat packaged in different atmospheric environments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20833707>Effect of N-acetyl cysteine and  on sulfur mustard caused impairment of in vitro endothelial tube formation.</a></h2><p>Sulfur mustard (SM), an alkylating chemical warfare agent, leads to tissue damage, including inflammation, blister formation, and impaired wound healing. Especially wound healing is of concern because after SM exposure, wound healing is prolonged. In this study, we focused on the effect of SM (30 and 100μM) on endothelial tube formation, apoptosis, and proliferation in mouse embryoid bodies (EBs), which provide an appropriate model for investigating vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. EBs were exposed to SM for 30 min on day 0, 3, or 6 of EBs' growth, were allowed to grow until day 7, then fixed, and immunostained (PECAM-1, Ki67, and activated caspase-3). SM significantly decreased endothelial tube formation compared with unexposed EBs. Additionally, we observed a significant increase of apoptosis. As the formation of reactive  species (ROS) is discussed to be involved in the pathophysiology of SM toxicity, we evaluated the effect of ROS scavengers (α- [ALA] and N-acetyl cysteine [NAC]) in the same experimental setup. Temporary effects of both scavengers could be detected, in particular NAC seemed to have temporary significant positive effects on endothelial tube formation in 100μM SM-exposed EBs. ALA augmented proliferation when administered after 30μM SM exposure on day 3, whereas NAC treatment on day 0 decreased apoptosis induced by 100μM SM. Taken together, our findings pointed to a negative effect of SM on vascularization and endothelial tube formation. ROS scavengers NAC and ALA showed temporary, but not long-lasting, rescuing effects regarding endothelial tube formation after SM exposure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19775712>Postprandial effects of a lipid-rich meal in the rat are modulated by the degree of unsaturation of 18C fatty acids.</a></h2><p>The fatty  composition of high-fat diets is known to influence the magnitude of postprandial events that increase the risk of metabolic syndrome. These variations in magnitude may be directly ascribed to differences in the channeling of lipids toward oxidation or storage. A study was designed to compare the effects of 4 dietary fats on postprandial energy expenditure and on some risk factors of the metabolic syndrome. To avoid usual confounding factors due to simultaneous variations in chain length and double-bounds number of fatty acids, dietary fats were chosen to provide mainly 18-carbon fatty acids with 0 (stearic  [SA]), 1 (oleic  [OA]), 2 (linoleic  [LA]), or 3 ( [ALA]) double bounds. They were given as single high-fat test meals to 4 different groups of male rats. The resting metabolic rate and the lipid and carbohydrate oxidation were measured from  consumption and carbon dioxide production using indirect calorimetry 2 hours before and 6.5 hours after the test meal. Plasma glucose, triglyceride, and chylomicron concentrations were determined at 0, 1.5, and 4 hours after the test meal. Postprandial concentration of glucose and triglyceride did not vary with the nature of the test meals, whereas that of chylomicrons was the highest after the LA test meal and the lowest after the SA test meal. Postprandial increase in resting metabolic rate was the highest after the LA and OA test meals, and the lowest after the SA and ALA test meals. Compared with the 3 other diets, the ALA test meal enhanced lipid oxidation and decreased glucose oxidation during the early postprandial period (0.25-3.25 hours). This suggests that stearic  may not induce all the adverse effects classically described for other saturated fatty acids and that  may beneficially influence energy partitioning, especially during the early postprandial state.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N-6 and n-3 PUFAs protect against breast cancer, but the molecular mechanisms of this effect are not clear. We investigated the effect of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs on OSGIN1 expression and whether OSGIN1 is involved in PUFA-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. We used 100 μM of n-6 PUFAs including arachidonic , linoleic , and gamma- and n-3 PUFAs including , eicosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). Only DHA significantly induced OSGIN1 protein and mRNA expression. DHA triggered reactive  species (ROS) generation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, suppressed DHA-induced OSGIN1 protein expression and nuclear accumulation of Nrf2. Nrf2 knockdown attenuated DHA-induced OSGIN1 expression. N-Acetyl-l-cysteine, a ROS scavenger, abrogated the DHA-induced increases in Akt phosphorylation, Nrf2 nuclear accumulation, and OSGIN1 expression. DHA induced the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, mitochondrial accumulation of OSGIN1 and p53, and cytochrome c release; knockdown of OSGIN1 diminished these effects. In conclusion, induction of OSGIN1 by DHA is at least partially associated with increased ROS production, which activates PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling. Induction of OSGIN1 may be involved in DHA-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study envisaged to develop doxorubicin (Dox) loaded folate functionalized nanoemulsion (NE) for profound therapeutic activity against mammary gland cancer. NE was prepared using pseudo-ternary phase diagrams utilizing α- (ALA) as lipid phase, to further enhance the anticancer potential of Dox. Box-Behnken design was employed to systematically develop the NE. Optimized NE (f-Dox-NE) was evaluated for in vitro and in vivo performance. f-Dox-NE, with globule size 55.2 ± 3.3 nm, zeta potential - 31 ± 2 mV, entrapment 92.51 ± 3.62%, drug loading 0.42 ± 0.08% and percent drug release 94.86 ± 1.87% in 72 h, was capable of reducing cell viability in MCF-7 cell lines vis-à-vis pure and marketed drug. Further, mechanistic studies in MCF-7 cell lines demonstrated that f-Dox-NE induces cellular apoptosis by reactive  species generated and mitochondrial membrane mediated apoptosis. The antitumor effect was evaluated in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) induced mammary gland tumor in female Albino Wistar rats. f-Dox-NE exhibited enhanced antitumor targeting potential, therapeutic safety and efficacy vis-à-vis pure and marketed drug, as revealed by tumor volume, animal survival, weight variation, cardiotoxicity and biodistribution studies. f-Dox-NE restored the biochemical parameters viz., SOD, catalase, TBARS and protein carbonyl, towards normal levels in comparison to DMBA induced animal group. f-Dox-NE displayed downregulation of anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2 and MMP-9) proteins and upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (caspase-9 and BAX).

While the pleiotropic biological activities of mammalian EFAs have been well documented, there is a paucity of information on the physiological relevance of plant EFAs and their biosynthesis. Potential candidates for EFA formation are caleosin-type peroxygenases which catalyze the epoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in the presence of hydroperoxides as co-oxidants. However, the caleosins characterized so far, which are mostly localized in seeds, are poor epoxidases. In sharp contrast, quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that PXG4, a class II caleosin gene, is expressed in roots, stems, leaves and flowers of Arabidopsis. Expressed in yeast, PXG4 encodes a calcium-dependent membrane-associated hemoprotein able to catalyze typical peroxygenase reactions. Moreover, we show here that purified recombinant PXG4 is an efficient fatty  epoxygenase, catalyzing the oxidation of cis double bonds of unsaturated fatty acids. Physiological linoleic and  acids proved to be the preferred substrates for PXG4; they are oxidized into the different positional isomers of the monoepoxides and into diepoxides. An important regioselectivity was observed; the C-12,13 double bond of these unsaturated fatty acids being the least favored unsaturation epoxidized by PXG4,  preferentially yielded the 9,10-15,16-diepoxide. Remarkably, PXG4 catalyzes exclusively the formation of (R),(S)-epoxide enantiomers, which is the absolute stereochemistry of the epoxides found in planta. These findings pave the way for the study of the functional role of EFAs and caleosins in plants.© 2012 The Authors Journal compilation © 2012 FEBS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049468>Effect of  with Bovine Serum Albumin or Methyl-Beta-Cyclodextrin on Membrane Integrity and Oxidative Stress of Frozen-Thawed Boar Sperm.</a></h2><p>The study was conducted to investigate the effects of  (ALA) combined with bovine serum albumin (BSA) or methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD) on plasma and acrosomal membrane damages, mitochondrial activity, morphological abnormality, motility, and oxidative stress in frozen-thawed boar sperm. In previous our study, 3 ng/mL ALA had been shown protective effect during freezing process of boar sperm. Therefore, we used 3 ng/mL ALA in present study and ALA was combined with same molar ratio of BSA or MBCD (ALA+BSA and ALA+MBCD, respectively). To confirm the effect of two carrier proteins, same volume of BSA and MBCD without ALA were added during cryopreservation. Membrane damage, mitochondrial activity, reactive  species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were measured using flow cytometry, and movement of sperm tail as motility parameter and morphological abnormality were observed under light microscope. In results, all of sperm parameters were enhanced by ALA combined with BSA or MBCD compared to control groups (<0.05). Mitochondrial activity, morphological abnormality, ROS and LPO levels in ALA+BSA or MBCD groups were no significant difference compared with ALA, BSA and MBCD treatment groups. On the other hand, plasma and acrosomal membrane intact, and sperm motility in ALA+MBCD group were higher than single treatment groups (0.05), whereas ALA+BSA did not differ. Our findings indicate that carrier proteins such as BSA and MBCD could improve the effect of ALA during cryopreservation of boar sperm, and treatment of ALA with carrier proteins enhance membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity through reduction of ROS-induced LPO.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20462428>Chronic and acute effects of walnuts on antioxidant capacity and nutritional status in humans: a randomized, cross-over pilot study.</a></h2><p>Compared with other common plant foods, walnuts (Juglans regia) are consistently ranked among the highest in antioxidant capacity. In vitro, walnut polyphenols inhibit plasma and LDL oxidation, while in animal models they lower biomarkers of oxidative stress and raise antioxidant capacity. A limited number of human feeding trials indicate that walnuts improve some measures of antioxidant status, but not others.A 19 wk, randomized crossover trial was conducted in 21 generally healthy men and postmenopausal women > or = 50 y to study the dose-response effects of walnut intake on biomarkers of antioxidant activity, oxidative stress, and nutrient status. Subjects were randomized to receive either 21 or 42 g raw walnuts/d during each 6 wk intervention phase with a 6 wk washout between phases. Subjects were instructed to consume their usual diet, but refrain from eating any other tree nuts, seeds, peanuts, or ellagitannin-rich foods during the entire study, and other polyphenol-rich foods for 2 d prior to each study visit.Compared to baseline levels, red blood cell (RBC) linoleic  and plasma pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) were significantly higher after 6 wk with 42 g/d walnuts (P < 0.05 for both). Overall, changes in plasma total thiols, and other antioxidant biomarkers, were not significant with either walnut dose. However, when compared to fasting levels, plasma total thiols were elevated within 1 h of walnut consumption with both doses during the baseline and end visits for each intervention phase (P < 0.05 for all). Despite the observed increase in RBC linoleic and  acids associated with walnut consumption, this substrate for lipid peroxidation only minimally affected malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant capacity. The proportional changes in MDA and  Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) were consistent with a dose-response effect, although no significant within- or between-group differences were observed for these measures.Walnut consumption did not significantly change the plasma antioxidant capacity of healthy, well-nourished older adults in this pilot study. However, improvements in linoleic  and pyridoxal phosphate were observed with chronic consumption, while total plasma thiols were enhanced acutely. Future studies investigating the antioxidant effects of walnuts in humans are warranted, but should include either a larger sample size or a controlled feeding intervention.ClinicalTrials.gov: .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28088424>Comparison between conjugated linoleic  and essential fatty acids in preventing oxidative stress in bovine mammary epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Some in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated protective effects of conjugated linoleic  (CLA) isomers against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. However, only a few and conflicting studies have been conducted showing the antioxidant potential of essential fatty acids. The objectives of the study were to compare the effects of CLA to other essential fatty acids on the thiol redox status of bovine mammary epithelia cells (BME-UV1) and their protective role against oxidative damage on the mammary gland by an in vitro study. The BME-UV1 cells were treated with complete medium containing 50 μM of cis-9,trans-11 CLA, trans-10,cis-12 CLA, α-, γ-, and linoleic . To assess the cellular antioxidant response, glutathione, NADPH, and γ-glutamyl-cysteine ligase activity were measured 48 h after addition of fatty acids (FA). Intracellular reactive  species and malondialdehyde production were also assessed in cells supplemented with FA. Reactive  species production after 3 h of HO exposure was assessed to evaluate and to compare the potential protection of different FA against HO-induced oxidative stress. All FA treatments induced an intracellular GSH increase, matched by high concentrations of NADPH and an increase of γ-glutamyl-cysteine ligase activity. Cells supplemented with FA showed a reduction in intracellular malondialdehyde levels. In particular, CLA isomers and linoleic  supplementation showed a better antioxidant cellular response against oxidative damage induced by HO compared with other FA.The Authors.

We analyzed a model system consisting of two yeasts with higher (Cryptococcus laurentii LS-28) or lower (Rhodotorula glutinis LS-11) antagonistic activity against the postharvest pathogens Botrytis cinerea and Penicillium expansum. LS-28 exhibited faster and greater colonization of wounds than LS-11. In contrast to LS-28, the number of LS-11 cells dropped 1 and 2 h after application, and then increased only later. In vitro, LS-28 was more resistant to ROS-generated oxidative stress. The combined application of biocontrol yeasts and ROS-deactivating enzymes in apple wounds prevented the decrease in number of LS-11 cells mentioned above, and enhanced colonization and antagonistic activity of both biocontrol yeasts against B. cinerea and P. expansum. Polar lipids of LS-11 contained the more unsaturated and oxidizable , which was absent in LS-28. Resistance to oxidative stress could be a key mechanism of biocontrol yeasts antagonism against postharvest wound pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27172872>How plausible is the use of dietary n-3 PUFA in the adjuvant therapy of cancer?</a></h2><p>Considerable debate exists regarding the potential antineoplastic effect of dietary long-chain n-3 PUFA contained in fatty fishes. Since the majority of published data has proven that their intake does not induce toxic or carcinogenic effects in humans, their possible preventive use against cancer has been suggested. On the other hand, it is unlikely that they could be effective in cancer patients as a single therapy. Nevertheless, a considerable effort has been put forth in recent years to evaluate the hypothesis that n-3 PUFA might improve the antineoplastic efficiency of currently used anticancer agents. The rationale for this therapeutic combinatory strategy is trying to increase cancer sensitivity to conventional therapies. This could allow the use of lower drug/radiation doses and, thereby, a reduction in the detrimental health effects associated with these treatments. We will here critically examine the studies that have investigated this possibility, by focusing particularly on the biological and molecular mechanisms underlying the antineoplastic effect of these combined treatments. A possible use of n-3 PUFA in combination with the innovative single-targeted anti-cancer therapies, that often are not completely devoid of dangerous side-effects, is also suggested.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18339313>Monoepoxy octadecadienoates and monoepoxy octadecatrienoates 2: mass spectral characterization.</a></h2><p>Methyl esters of C18 polyunsaturated fatty acids, including gamma-,  and stearidonic , were epoxidised using m-chloroperbenzoic .

Repeated use of frying oils is a common practice, and in the presence of atmospheric  it produces various undesirable reactions in used oils. Stable frying oils usually require low  (LnA < 3%), increased oleic  (OA > 40%), and decreased linoleic  (LA < 50%). The aim of this study was to establish the behavior of palm superolein (PSO) (OA 45%; LA 12.5%; LnA 0.2%) and olive oil (OO) during repeated, discontinuous deep frying of French fries. The behavior of the oils under controlled heating conditions was also studied by maintaining all of the process variables the same as those in deep frying, except that there was no food in the oil. The PSO selected to be tested in this study may represent an alternative to OO as a frying medium. Although PSO presented a faster increase in some oxidation indices, such as free fatty  and total polar compounds, for other indicators, PSO showed better behavior than OO (less formation of C8:0 and lower peroxide value).© 2012 Institute of Food Technologists®</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24404338>Direct Analysis in Real Time Mass Spectrometry (DART-MS) Analysis of Skin Metabolome Changes in the Ultraviolet B-Induced Mice.</a></h2><p>Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a major environmental factor that leads to acute and chronic reactions in the human skin. UV exposure induces wrinkle formation, DNA damage, and generation of reactive  species (ROS). Most mechanistic studies of skin physiology and pharmacology related with UV-irradiated skin have focused on proteins and their related gene expression or single- targeted small molecules. The present study identified and analyzed the alteration of skin metabolites following UVB irradiation and topical retinyl palmitate (RP, 5%) treatment in hairless mice using direct analysis in real time (DART) time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) with multivariate analysis. Under the negative ion mode, the DART ion source successfully ionized various fatty acids including palmitoleic and . From DART-TOF-MS fingerprints measured in positive mode, the prominent dehydrated ion peak (m/z: 369, M+H-H2O) of cholesterol was characterized in all three groups. In positive mode, the discrimination among three groups was much clearer than that in negative mode by using multivariate analysis of orthogonal partial-least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). DART-TOF-MS can ionize various small organic molecules in living tissues and is an efficient alternative analytical tool for acquiring full chemical fingerprints from living tissues without requiring sample preparation. DART-MS measurement of skin tissue with multivariate analysis proved to be a powerful method to discriminate between experimental groups and to find biomarkers for various experiment models in skin dermatological research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27035483>Effect of low temperature on highly unsaturated fatty  biosynthesis in activated sludge.</a></h2><p>Low temperature is a limiting factor for the microbial activity of activated sludge for sewage treatment plant in winter. Highly unsaturated fatty  (UFA) biosynthesis, phospholipid fatty  (PLFA) constituents and microbial structure in activated sludge at low temperature were investigated. Over 12 gigabases of metagenomic sequence data were generated with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. The result showed 43.11% of phospholipid fatty  (PLFA) in the activated sludge participated in UFA biosynthesis, and γ- could be converted to Arachidonic  at low temperature. The highly UFA biosynthesis in activated sludge was n-6 highly UFA biosynthesis, rather than n-3 highly UFA biosynthesis. The microbial community structures of activated sludge were analyzed by PLFA and high-throughput sequencing (HiSeq) simultaneously. Acidovorax, Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium and Polaromonas occupied higher percentage at 5°C, and genetic changes of highly UFA biosynthesis derived from microbial community structures change.Copyright © 2016.

This oxidation influences cellular metabolism and can trigger cellular signaling cascades, since cellular membranes and the stratum corneum contain a substantial amount of fatty acids and lipids. Using highly sensitive IR-photomultiplier technology, we investigated the generation of singlet  by fatty acids and lipids. In combination with their oxidized products, the fatty acids or lipids produced singlet  under UVA radiation at 355 nm that is directly shown by luminescence detection.  or arachidonic  showed the strongest luminescence signals, followed by linoleic  and docohexaenoic . The amount of singlet  induced by lipids such as phosphatidylcholine was significantly higher compared to the corresponding fatty acids within phospholipids. This result indicates a synergistic process of  radicals and singlet  during irradiation. UVA radiation initiates singlet  generation, which subsequently oxidizes other fatty acids that in turn produce additional singlet . This leads to an enhancement of UVA-induced damage of fatty acids and lipids, which must enhance the oxidative damages in cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19648018>Overexpression of endoplasmic reticulum omega-3 fatty  desaturase gene improves chilling tolerance in tomato.</a></h2><p>An endoplasmic reticulum-localized tomato omega-3 fatty  desaturase gene (LeFAD3) was isolated and characterized with regard to its sequence, response to various temperatures and function in transgenic tomato plants. Northern blot analysis showed that LeFAD3 was expressed in all organs tested and was markedly abundant in roots. Meanwhile, the expression of LeFAD3 was induced by chilling stress (4 degrees C), but inhibited by high temperature (40 degrees C). The transgenic plants were obtained under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (35S-CaMV). Northern and western blot analyses confirmed that sense LeFAD3 was transferred into tomato genome and overexpressed. Level of  acids (18:3) increased and correspondingly level of linoleic  (18:2) decreased in leaves and roots. After chilling stress, the fresh weight of the aerial parts of transgenic plants was higher than that of the wild type (WT) plants, and the membrane system ultrastructure of chloroplast in leaf cell and all the subcellular organelles in root tips of transgenic plants kept more intact than those of WT. Relative electric conductivity increased less in transgenic plants than that in WT, and the respiration rate of the transgenic plants was notably higher than that of WT. The maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (F(v)/F(m)) and the O(2) evolution rate in WT decreased more than those in transgenic plants under chilling stress. Together with other data, results showed that the overexpression of LeFAD3 led to increased level of 18:3 and alleviated the injuries under chilling stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24031799>Aeration effect on Spirulina platensis growth and γ- production.</a></h2><p>The influence of aeration on algal growth and gamma- (GLA) production in a bubble column photobioreactor was investigated. Studies were performed in a 20-L reactor at different aeration rates (0.2- 2.5 vvm). Static, continuous, and periodic operation of air resulted in 41.9%, 88.4%, and 108% air saturation of dissolved , for which the corresponding values of GLA were 2.3, 6.5, and 7.5 mg·g(-1) dry cell weight, respectively. An increase in the aeration rate from 0.2 to 2.5 vvm enhanced both the specific growth rate and GLA content under periodic sparging in the bicarbonate medium. With a 6-fold increase in the aeration rate, the GLA content of the alga increased by 69.64% (5.6-9.5 mg· g(-1) dry cell weight). In addition, the total fatty  (TFA) content in dry biomass increased from 2.22% to 4.41%, whereas the algae maintained a constant GLA to TFA ratio within the aeration rate tested. The dependence of GLA production on the aeration rate was explained by interrelating the GLA production rate with the specific growth rate using the Luedeking and Piret mixed growth model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30201972>Co-overexpression of native phospholipid-biosynthetic genes plsX and plsC enhances lipid production in Synechocystis sp.

PCC 6803. Growth rate, intracellular pigment contents including chlorophyll a and carotenoids, and  evolution rate of all overexpressing (OX) strains were normally similar as wild type. For fatty  compositions, saturated fatty , in particular palmitic  (16:0) was dominantly increased in OX strains whereas slight increases of unsaturated fatty acids were observed, specifically linoleic  (18:2) and  (18:3). The plsC/plsX-overexpressing (OX + XC) strain produced high lipid content of about 24.3%w/dcw under normal condition and was further enhanced up to 39.1%w/dcw by acetate induction. This OX + XC engineered strain was capable of decreasing phaA transcript level which related to poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis under acetate treatment. Moreover, the expression level of gene transcripts revealed that the plsX- and plsC/plsX-overexpression strains had also increased accA transcript amounts which involved in the irreversible carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. Altogether, these overexpressing strains significantly augmented higher lipid contents when compared to wild type by partly overcoming the limitation of lipid production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18296335>New bioactive fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Many oxygenated fatty acids are bioactive compounds. Nocardia cholesterolicum and Flavobacterium DS5 convert oleic  to 10 hydroxy stearic  and linoleic  to 10-hydroxy-12(Z)-octadecanoic . Pseudomonas aeruginosa PR3 converts oleic  to the new compounds, 7,10-dihydroxy-8(E)-octadecenoic  (DOD) through 10-hydroxy-8-octadecenoic , and racinoleic  to 7,10,12-trihydroxy-8-octadecenoic . DOD showed antibacterial activity including against food-borne pathogens. Bacillus megaterium ALA2 converted n-6 and n-3 PUFAs to many new oxygenated fatty acids. For example: linoleic  was converted to12,13-epoxy-9-octadecenoic  and then to 12,13-dihydroxy-9-octadecenoic  (12,13-DHOA). From here, there are two bioconversion pathways. The major pathway is: 12,13-DHOA --> 12,13,17-trihydroxy-9(S)-octadecenoic  (THOA) --> 12,17;13,17-diepoxy-16-hydroxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic  (DEOA) --> 7-hydroxy-DEOA. The minor pathway is: 12,13-DHOA --> 12,13,16-THOA --> 12-hydroxy-13,16-epoxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic . 12,13,17-THOA has anti-plant pathogenic fungal activity. The tetrahydrofuranyl moiety is known in anti cancer drugs. Strain ALA2 also converts other n-3 and n-6 PUFAs such as eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and arachidonic  (AA) to many new oxygenated unsaturated fatty  products. All of these new products have high potential for antimicrobial agents or biomedical applications. We also screened 12 Mortierella fungal strains from the ARS Culture Collection for the production of bioactive fatty acids such as dihomo-gama- (DGLA) and arachidonic . All of the strains tested produced AA and DGLA from glucose or glycerol. The top five AA producers (mg AA/g CDW) were in the following order: M. alpina > M. zychae > M. hygrophila > M. minutissima > M. parvispora.

Retinal vascular endothelial cell dysfunction is an early event in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. Studies showed that hyperglycemia-induced excess proliferation of retinal vascular endothelial cells can be abrogated by docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6 ω-3) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20:5 ω-3). The influence of dietary omega-3 PUFA on brain zinc metabolism has been previously implied. Zn2+ is essential for the activity of Δ6 desaturase as a co-factor that, in turn, converts essential fatty acids to their respective long chain metabolites. Whether essential fatty acids (EFAs) α- and linoleic  have similar beneficial effect remains poorly understood.RF/6A cells were treated with different concentrations of high glucose, α- and linoleic  and Zn2+. The alterations in mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase enzyme activity, cell membrane fluidity, reactive  species generation, SOD enzyme and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion were evaluated.Studies showed that hyperglycemia-induced excess proliferation of retinal vascular endothelial cells can be abrogated by both linoleic  (LA) and α- (ALA), while the saturated fatty , palmitic  was ineffective. A dose-response study with ALA showed that the activity of the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase enzyme was suppressed at all concentrations of glucose tested to a significant degree. High glucose enhanced fluorescence polarization and microviscocity reverted to normal by treatment with Zn2+ and ALA. ALA was more potent that Zn2+. Increased level of high glucose caused slightly increased ROS generation that correlated with corresponding decrease in SOD activity. ALA suppressed ROS generation to a significant degree in a dose dependent fashion and raised SOD activity significantly. ALA suppressed high-glucose-induced VEGF secretion by RF/6A cells.These results suggest that EFAs such as ALA and LA may have beneficial action in the prevention of high glucose-induced cellular damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23597680>Microbial lipid production from potato processing wastewater using oleaginous filamentous fungi Aspergillus oryzae.</a></h2><p>Use of potato processing wastewater for microbial lipid production by oleaginous filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae was studied with the purpose of recycling potato processing wastewater for biodiesel production. The wastewater contained high concentrations of solids, starch and nutrients. Sterilization of the potato processing wastewater resulted in a thick gelatinized medium, causing the fungi to grow slow. In order to overcome this problem, the wastewater was diluted with tap water at three dilution ratios (25%, 50% and 75% before fermentation). Dilution of the wastewater not only enhanced lipid production, starch utilization and amylase secretion but also COD and nutrient removal. The dilution ratio of 25% was found to be optimum for lipid production and the maximum lipid concentration obtained was 3.5 g/L. Lipid accumulation was influenced by amylase secretion, and the amylase activity was up to 53.5 IU/mL at 25% dilution. The results show that phosphate limitation may be the mechanism to stimulate the lipid accumulation. In addition to lipid production, removals of COD, total soluble nitrogen and total soluble phosphorus up to 91%, 98% and 97% were achieved, respectively. Microbial lipids of A. oryzae contained major fatty acids such as palmitic  (11.6%), palmitolic  (15.6%), stearic  (19.3%), oleic  (30.3%),  (5.5%) and linoleic  (6.5%) suggesting that the lipids be suitable for second generation biodiesel production.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The delta(13)C(bulk), delta(2)H(bulk), and delta(18)O(bulk) values were determined by continuous flow combustion and high-temperature conversion elemental analyzer-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA/IRMS, TC-EA/IRMS). The delta(13)C(FA) values were determined using gas chromatography--combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS). For comparison, other C(3) vegetable oils rich in  (flax and false flax oils) and rich in linoleic  (poppy, sunflower, and safflower oils) were submitted to the same chemical and isotopic analyses. The bulk and molecular delta(13)C values were typical for C(3) plants. The delta(13)C value of palmitic  (delta(13)C(16:0)) and n-3  (delta(13)C(18:3n-3)) differed (p < 0.001) between rape, flax, and poppy oils. Also within species, significant differences of delta(13)C(FA) were observed (p < 0.01). The hydrogen and  isotope compositions of rape oil differed between cultivars (p < 0.05). Major differences in the individual delta(13)C(FA) values were found. A plant-specific carbon isotope fractionation occurs during the biosynthesis of the fatty acids and particularly during desaturation of C(18) acids in rape and flax.

In addition, the secretion of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-γ, interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, was up-regulated. Collectively, our results indicated that the naturally-occurring CLNA isomer, jacaric , could exhibit immunomodulating activity on the murine peritoneal macrophages in vitro, suggesting that this CLNA isomer may act as an immunopotentiator which can be exploited for the treatment of some immunological disorders with minimal toxicity and fewer side effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814038>Hempseed oil induces reactive  species- and C/EBP homologous protein-mediated apoptosis in MH7A human rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synovial cells.</a></h2><p>The medicinal efficacy of hempseed (Cannabis sativa L.), which is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, in atopic dermatitis, inflammation, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been suggested for centuries. Hempseed has been used as a treatment for these diseases in Korean and Chinese folk medicine. The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of hempseed oil (HO) on MH7A human RA fibroblast-like synovial cells.MH7A cells were used to study the anti-rheumatoid effects of hempseed (Cannabis sativa L., cv. Cheungsam/Cannabaceae) oil by investigating cell viability, apoptosis, lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis.HO treatment reduced the survival rate of MH7A cells and promoted apoptotic cell death in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Both lipid accumulation and the level of intracellular reactive  species (ROS) increased in HO-treated MH7A cells. Co-treatment with the antioxidant Tiron effectively abrogated the cytotoxic effects of HO; the ROS level was reduced, cell viability was recovered, and apoptotic cell death was significantly diminished. Moreover, HO-treated cells exhibited increased expression of the major ER stress markers, glucose-regulated protein 78 and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). The siRNA-mediated knockdown of CHOP prevented HO-induced apoptosis.Our results suggest that HO treatment induced lipid accumulation, ROS production, CHOP expression, and apoptosis in MH7A cells, and that CHOP functions as an anti-rheumatoid factor downstream of HO in MH7A cells.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The CCK-8 assay demonstrated that ALA inhibited MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Further, the results of LDH activity and ROS levels revealed that ALA-induced cancer cell damage was closely related to oxidative stress. Under the irradiation of ultraviolet light, the microemulsion without any added fluorescent dye would emit bright blue fluorescence, and the fluorescent images of the cells treated with ALA-loaded O/W and W/O/W microemulsions at different incubation times were taken, which exhibited long-term photostability and biocompatibility. In addition, the fluorescence mechanism of the microemulsion was explained by immobilizing surfactant molecules with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties at the water-oil interface through the microemulsion with a self-assembled structure. These findings showed the potential application of O/W and W/O/W microemulsions as the label-free delivery carriers in long-term imaging of living cells and real-time release monitoring of nutrients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24892517>Chlorambucil (nitrogen mustard) induced impairment of early vascular endothelial cell migration - effects of α- and N-acetylcysteine.</a></h2><p>Alkylating agents (e.g. sulfur and nitrogen mustards) cause a variety of cell and tissue damage including wound healing disorder. Migration of endothelial cells is of utmost importance for effective wound healing. In this study we investigated the effects of chlorambucil (a nitrogen mustard) on early endothelial cells (EEC) with special focus on cell migration. Chlorambucil significantly inhibited migration of EEC in Boyden chamber and wound healing experiments. Cell migration is linked to cytoskeletal organization. We therefore investigated the distribution pattern of the Golgi apparatus as a marker of cell polarity. Cells are polarized under control conditions, whereas chlorambucil caused an encircling perinuclear position of the Golgi apparatus, indicating non-polarized cells. ROS are discussed to be involved in the pathophysiology of alkylating substances and are linked to cell migration and cell polarity. Therefore we investigated the influence of ROS-scavengers (α- (ALA) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC)) on the impaired EEC migration. Both substances, in particular ALA, improved EEC migration. Notably ALA restored cell polarity. Remarkably, investigations of ROS and RNS biomarkers (8-isoprostane and nitrotyrosine) did not reveal a significant increase after chlorambucil exposure when assessed 24h post exposure. A distinct breakdown of mitochondrial membrane potential (measured by TMRM) that recovered under ALA treatment was observed. In conclusion our results provide compelling evidence that the alkylating agent chlorambucil dramatically impairs directed cellular migration, which is accompanied by perturbations of cell polarity and mitochondrial membrane potential. ALA treatment was able to reconstitute cell polarity and to stabilize mitochondrial potential resulting in improved cell migration.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Among several isoforms, 5-LOX and 12/15-LOX are especially important in neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration. These two LOXs are regulated by substrate concentration and availability, and by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation through protein kinases PKA, PKC and MAP-kinases, including ERK1/ERK2 and p38. The protein/protein interaction also is involved in the mechanism of 5-LOX regulation through FLAP protein and coactosin-like protein. Moreover, non-heme iron and calcium ions are potent regulators of LOXs. The enzyme activity significantly depends on the cell redox state and is differently regulated by various signaling pathways. 5-LOX and 12/15-LOX convert , AA, and DHA into several bioactive compounds e.g. hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (5-HPETE, 12S-HPETE, 15S-HPETE), which are reduced to corresponding HETE compounds. These enzymes synthesize several bioactive lipids, e.g. leucotrienes, lipoxins, hepoxilins and docosahexaenoids. 15-LOX is responsible for DHA metabolism into neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) with significant antiapoptotic properties which is down-regulated in AD. In this review, the regulation and impact of 5-LOX and 12/15-LOX in the pathomechanism of AD is discussed. Moreover, we describe the role of several products of LOXs, which may have significant pro- or anti-inflammatory activity in AD, and the cytoprotective effects of LOX inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19093867>Changes in the fatty  composition of M. longissimus dorsi of lamb during storage in a high- modified atmosphere at different levels of dietary vitamin E supplementation.</a></h2><p>The effect of vitamin E supplementation on fatty  composition during storage of lamb meat packed in a high- modified atmosphere was studied. Lambs were fed with diets supplemented with four levels of vitamin E (0, 250, 500, and 1000 mg acetate-alpha-tocopherol/kg feed). Slices of M. longissimus dorsi were packed in a high- modified atmosphere (70% O2:30% CO2) and stored at 2 +/- 1 degrees C in the dark for 14, 21, and 28 days. The nonsupplemented group (E0) showed an increase in saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids and a reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in total fatty acids. The proportion of SFA and PUFA was unchanged in the supplemented groups (E250, E500, and E1000). The supplementation with 250 mg acetate-alpha-tocopherol/kg feed prevented the oxidation of PUFA in the total lipids and in the polar lipids fraction, while 500 mg acetate-alpha-tocopherol/kg feed was necessary to prevent the oxidation of PUFA in free fatty acids. Supplementing vitamin E not only inhibited lipid oxidation but also maintained nutritional value [essential fatty acids, linoleic  (C18:2n-6) and  (C18:3n-3), and beneficial fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic  (C22:6n-3)] throughout the storage period.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19817459>Effect of genotype, environment, and their interaction on chemical composition and antioxidant properties of low- soybeans grown in Maryland.</a></h2><p>Eight soybean genotypes grown in three environments in Maryland were analyzed for total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant capacity, isoflavone composition, lutein, tocopherols, fatty  composition, and oil content. Fatty  composition, isoflavones, lutein, tocopherols, and specific antioxidant assays had significant variation by genotype (G) (P < 0.05). Environment (E) had a significant effect on fatty acids, lutein, individual tocopherols,  radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and the isoflavone glycitein (P < 0.05). In addition, the interaction between genotype and environment (G x E) showed a significant effect on antioxidant capacity, isoflavones, lutein, tocopherols, and fatty acids (P < 0.05). Factorial designed analysis of variance of all data indicated that G had a larger effect than E on the majority of fatty acids, total isoflavones, lutein, and total tocopherols. E had a larger effect than G on stearic  (18:0), glycitein, delta-tocopherol, and ORAC. The results of this study show that the genotype, growing environment, and their interactions in Maryland-grown soybeans may alter the levels of specific health-enhancing properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28965129>α- supplementation prevents exercise-induced improvements in white adipose tissue mitochondrial bioenergetics and whole-body glucose homeostasis in obese Zucker rats.</a></h2><p>While the underlying mechanisms in the development of insulin resistance remain inconclusive, metabolic dysfunction in both white adipose tissue (WAT) and skeletal muscle have been implicated in the process. Therefore, we investigated the independent and combined effects of α- (ALA) supplementation and exercise training on whole-body glucose homeostasis and mitochondrial bioenergetics within the WAT and skeletal muscle of obese Zucker rats.We randomly assigned obese Zucker rats to receive a control diet alone or supplemented with ALA and to remain sedentary or undergo exercise training for 4 weeks (CON-Sed, ALA-Sed, CON-Ex and ALA-Ex groups). Whole-body glucose tolerance was determined in response to a glucose load. Mitochondrial content and bioenergetics were examined in skeletal muscle and epididymal WAT (eWAT). Insulin sensitivity and cellular stress were assessed by western blot.Exercise training independently improved whole-body glucose tolerance as well as insulin-induced signalling in muscle and WAT. However, the consumption of ALA during exercise training prevented exercise-mediated improvements in whole-body glucose tolerance. ALA consumption did not influence exercise-induced adaptations within skeletal muscle, insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial bioenergetics. In contrast, within eWAT, ALA supplementation attenuated insulin signalling, decreased mitochondrial respiration and increased the fraction of electron leak to reactive oxygen species (ROS).These findings indicate that, in an obese rodent model, consumption of ALA attenuates the favourable adaptive changes of exercise training within eWAT, which consequently impacts whole-body glucose homeostasis. The direct translation to humans, however, remains to be determined.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24035100>Induction of apoptosis and inhibition of invasion in choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells by α-calendic  and β-calendic .</a></h2><p>Alfa-calendic  and β-calendic , geometric and positional isomers of  were previously shown to possess potent anticancer properties. In this study, we found that α-calendic  and β-calendic  could induce apoptosis and suppress invasion of human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells in vitro. Treatment with α-calendic  and β-calendic  significantly increased oxidative stress in human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells detected by the level of reactive  species (ROS), lipid peroxidation production malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and the effects of antioxidants NAC and α-tocopherol. Furthermore, oxidative stress activated the phosphorylation of p38MAPK. SB203580, a selective p38MAPK inhibitor, blocked the apoptosis induced by α-calendic  and β-calendic  by upregulating Bcl-2/Bax ratio and inhibition of the activation of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9. SB20350 also partially abrogated the cell invasion effects of α-calendic  and β-calendic . These results suggested that α-calendic  and β-calendic  induced apoptosis and inhibited invasion in JEG-3 cells by activation of oxidative stress pathways and subsequent activation of P38MAPK.Copyright © 2013.

In addition, we compared the effect of an injection of SFE with that of OA, soybean oil (a source of SFE), emulsified OA and C-18 fatty acids. Bolus injection of SFE (0.3-4.8 ml/kg) had little effect on Pao2) and pulmonary vascular permeability. Injection of an equivalent amount of OA, on the other hand, significantly decreased Pao2 and increased pulmonary vascular hyper-permeability. This decrease in Pao2 was attenuated by emulsification. Unemulsified soybean oil also induced a decrease in Pao2, although the effect was weaker than that of OA. Other unsaturated C-18 fatty acids (linoleic and ) induced a decrease in Pao2 as potent as OA while stearic , a C-18 saturated fatty , had little effect. Although we did not observe pulmonary toxicity as a result of "bolus injection" of SFE, the chemical form, for example, emulsification and the degree of saturability of the carbon chain, seems to influence the pulmonary toxicities of lipids and fatty acids. Furthermore, the potent pulmonary toxicity of OA seems to depend not only on pulmonary vascular embolization but also pharmacological and/or inflammation-inducing properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29668263>Neuroprotective Effect of  against Aβ-Mediated Inflammatory Responses in C6 Glial Cell.</a></h2><p>Therapeutic approaches for neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), have been widely studied. One of the critical hallmarks of AD is accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ). Aβ induces neurotoxicity and releases inflammatory mediators or cytokines through activation of glial cell, and these pathological features are observed in AD patient's brain. The purpose of this study is to investigate the protective effect of  (ALA) on Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in C6 glial cells. Exposure of C6 glial cells to 50 μM Aβ caused cell death, overproduction of nitric oxide (NO), and pro-inflammatory cytokines release [interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α], while treatment of ALA increased cell viability and markedly attenuated Aβ-induced excessive production of NO and those inflammatory cytokines. Inhibitory effect of ALA on generation of NO and cytokines was mediated by down-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 protein and mRNA expressions. In addition, ALA treatment inhibited reactive  species generation induced by Aβ through the enhancement of the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf-2) protein levels and subsequent induction of heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in C6 glial cells dose- and time-dependently. Furthermore, the levels of neprilysin and insulin-degrading enzyme protein expressions, which contribute to degradation of Aβ, were also increased by treatment of ALA compared to Aβ-treated control group. In conclusion, effects of ALA on Aβ degradation were shown to be mediated through inhibition of inflammatory responses and activation of antioxidative system, Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling pathway, in C6 glial cells. Our findings suggest that ALA might have the potential for therapeutics of AD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22609276>Beta-eleostearic  induce apoptosis in T24 human bladder cancer cells through reactive  species (ROS)-mediated pathway.</a></h2><p>Beta-eleostearic  (β-ESA, 9E11E13E-18:3), a  isomer with a conjugated triene system, is a natural and biologically active compound. Herein, we investigated effects of β-eleostearic  on T24 human bladder cancer cells. In this study, results showed that β-eleostearic  had strong cytotoxicity to induce cell apoptosis, which was mediated by reactive  species (ROS) in T24 cells. The cell viability assay results showed that incubation with β-eleostearic  concentrations of 10-80μmol/L caused a dose- and time-dependent decrease of T24 cell viability, and the IC(50) value was 21.2μmol/L at 24h and 13.1μmol/L at 48h. Annexin V/PI double staining was used to assess apoptosis with flow cytometry. Treatment with β-eleostearic  caused massive ROS accumulation and GSH decrease, which lead to activation of caspase-3 and down-regulation of Bcl-2 indicating induction of apoptosis. Subsequently, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and PEG-catalase effectively blocked the ROS elevated effect of β-eleostearic , which suggested that β-eleostearic -induced apoptosis involved ROS generated. Additionally, we found that treating T24 cells with β-eleostearic  induced activation of PPARγ. A PPARγ-activated protein kinase inhibitor was able to partially abrogate the effects of β-eleostearic . These results suggested that β-eleostearic  can induce T24 cells apoptosis via a ROS-mediated pathway which may be involved PPARγ activation.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Despite glutathione has pivotal properties in the complex cytoplasmic antioxidant system, its supplementation is hampered by limited transmembrane absorption. Modification of glutathione pharmacokinetic properties via acetylation with long chain polyunsaturated fatty  may improve its passage through phospholipidic membranes.This was a single center randomized double-blinded clinical trial, versus placebo, cross sectional pairwise at time 0. The partecipants were 10 healthy volunteers with skin phototypes II or III and age ≥18 years interested in performing MED evaluation performed by photoallergology unit of Dermatology division, P. Palagi hospital, Florence. Each volunteer underwent UVB phototesting, treating 4 distinct areas with increasing UVB doses in 4 distinct conditions. One arm was treated as standard procedure ("Naïve" arm), one applying -glutathione conjugate (Lin-GSH) cream 2% before irradiation ("Pre Lin-GSH" arm), one with placebo ("placebo" arm) and one applying Lin-GSH cream 2% after irradiation ("post Lin-GSH" arm). The aim was to evaluate efficacy of Lin-GSH cream 2% before UVB irradiation compared with placebo. Secondary objective is the evaluation of the same cream applied after irradiation compared to no treatment. Other Secondary objective is the evaluation of safety in both conditions. Mean MED was evaluated at distinct conditions. Safety was evaluated reporting all grade 3-4 adverse events up to 30 days after treatment. All volunteers were treated in all 4 experimental conditions. "Pre Lin-GSH" and "Placebo" arms were applied in a double blind condition in each volunteer. Neither the volunteer nor the investigator executing MED evaluation knew which arm contained Lin-GSH and which one contained placebo.Ten volunteers among 12 recruited for the study were correctly randomized and completed all study evaluations. Recruitment went from 01 April 2016 to 01 May 2016, up to adequate population number. Mean MED in "Pre Lin-GSH" arm was superior to mean MED in "placebo" arm (135 mJ/cm2 ± 5.53 vs 105 mJ/cm2 ± 7.64, p=0.0003. No difference was observed among mean MED in "Post Lin-GSH" and "Naïve" arms. No grade 3-4 Adverse Events were reported.Lin-GSH 2% cream seems a safe and effective molecule able to exert significant increase in MED compared with placebo thanks to its antioxidant properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19723085>Inhibitory mechanism of omega-3 fatty acids in pancreatic inflammation and apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress is regarded as a major pathogenic factor in acute pancreatitis. Inflammation and apoptosis linked to oxidative stress has been implicated in cerulein-induced pancreatitis as an experimental model of acute pancreatitis. Recently, we found that reactive  species mediate inflammatory cytokine expression and apoptosis of pancreatic acinar cells stimulated with cerulein. Omega-3 fatty acids show antioxidant action in various cells and tissues. In the present study, we investigated whether omega-3 fatty acids inhibit cytokine expression in cerulein-stimulated pancreatic acinar cells and whether omega-3 fatty acids suppress apoptotic cell death in pancreatic acinar cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide. We found that omega-3 fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and  (ALA), suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6) and inhibited the activation of transcription factor activator protein-1 in cerulein-stimulated pancreatic acinar cells. DHA and ALA inhibited DNA fragmentation, inhibited the decrease in cell viability, and inhibited the expression of apoptotic genes (p53, Bax, apoptosis-inducing factor) induced by hydrogen peroxide in pancreatic acinar cells. In conclusion, omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial for preventing oxidative stress-induced pancreatic inflammation and apoptosis by inhibiting inflammatory cytokine and apoptotic gene expression of pancreatic acinar cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23579616>Oleic, linoleic and  acids increase ros production by fibroblasts via NADPH oxidase activation.</a></h2><p>The effect of oleic, linoleic and γ- acids on ROS production by 3T3 Swiss and Rat 1 fibroblasts was investigated. Using lucigenin-amplified chemiluminescence, a dose-dependent increase in extracellular superoxide levels was observed during the treatment of fibroblasts with oleic, linoleic and γ- acids. ROS production was dependent on the addition of β-NADH or NADPH to the medium. Diphenyleneiodonium inhibited the effect of oleic, linoleic and γ- acids on fibroblast superoxide release by 79%, 92% and 82%, respectively. Increased levels of p47 (phox) phosphorylation due to fatty  treatment were detected by Western blotting analyses of fibroblast proteins. Increased p47 (phox) mRNA expression was observed using real-time PCR. The rank order for the fatty  stimulation of the fibroblast oxidative burst was as follows: γ- > linoleic > oleic. In conclusion, oleic, linoleic and γ- acids stimulated ROS production via activation of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex in fibroblasts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24207097>Degradation of lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins by glyoxysomes from sunflower and cucumber cotyledons.</a></h2><p>Oilseed germination is characterized by the degradation of storage lipids. It may proceed either via the direct action of a triacylglycerol lipase, or in certain plant species via a specific lipid body 13-lipoxygenase. For the involvement of a lipoxygenase previous results suggested that the hydroxy- or oxo-group that is being introduced into the fatty  backbone by this lipoxygenase forms a barrier to continuous β-oxidation.This study shows however that a complete degradation of oxygenated fatty acids is possible by isolated cucumber and sunflower glyoxysomes. Interestingly, degradation is accompanied by the formation of saturated short chain acyl-CoAs with chain length between 4 and 12 carbon atoms lacking the hydroxy- or oxo-diene system of the oxygenated fatty  substrate. The presence of these CoA esters suggests the involvement of a specific reduction of the diene system at a chain length of 12 carbon atoms including conversion of the hydroxy-group at C7.To our knowledge this metabolic pathway has not been described for the degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids so far. It may represent a new principle to degrade oxygenated fatty  derivatives formed by lipoxygenases or chemical oxidation initiated by reactive  species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20066898>Omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids enhance arsenic trioxide efficacy in arsenic trioxide-resistant leukemic and solid tumor cells.</a></h2><p>Recently we showed that the polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) docosahexaenoic  (DHA) sensitizes arsenic trioxide (As2O3)-resistant tumor cells to a clinically achievable concentration (1 microM) of As2O3 via a reactive  species (ROS)-dependent mechanism. The aim of the present study was to evaluate, whether this combined effect of As2O3 and DHA is also applicable to other PUFAs [i.e., eicospentaenoic  (EPA), arachidonic  (AA), and gamma- (GLA)]. Fourteen tumor cell lines were incubated with As2O3 (1 microM), PUFA (25-100 microM), or the combination thereof (+/- vitamin E). Cell viability (colorimetric), apoptosis (bivariate annexin V/propidium iodide staining, detection of hypodiploid DNA), and thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) were evaluated. Twelve of 14 As2O3-resistant cell lines tested were resistant to PUFA monotherapy. However, combined treatment with As2O3 and either PUFA significantly reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner with AA being the most potent As2O3 enhancer. The combined cytotoxic effect of As2O3/AA treatment was due to induction of apoptosis, preceded by increased intracellular TBARS and was abolished by the antioxidant vitamin E. Importantly, the combined effect of As2O3 and AA was selectively toxic for malignant cells because no cytotoxic effect was observed in normal skin fibroblasts and human microvascular endothelial cells. In conclusion, our study shows that also other PUFAs than DHA-and in particular the omega-6-PUFA AA--can be used as effective modulators of tumor cell chemosensitivity to clinically achievable concentrations of As2O3. Enhanced lipid peroxidation most likely constitutes the key mechanism for the combined effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29442208>The role of acyl-CoA thioesterase ACOT8I in mediating intracellular  in oleaginous fungus Mortierella alpina.</a></h2><p>Thioesterases (TEs) play an essential role in the  of fatty acids (FAs). To explore the role of TEs in mediating intracellular  in the oleaginous fungus Mortierella alpina, the acyl-CoA thioesterase ACOT8I was overexpressed. The contents of total fatty acids (TFAs) were the same in the recombinant strains as in the wild-type M. alpina, whilst the production of free fatty acids (FFAs) was enhanced from about 0.9% (wild-type) to 2.8% (recombinant), a roughly threefold increase. Linoleic  content in FFA form constituted about 9% of the TFAs in the FFA fraction in the recombinant strains but only about 1.3% in the wild-type M. alpina. The gamma- and arachidonic  contents in FFA form accounted for about 4 and 25%, respectively, of the TFAs in the FFA fraction in the recombinant strains, whilst neither of them in FFA form were detected in the wild-type M. alpina.

At baseline, trained investigators graded the severity of facial skin photoaging using a validated 6-grade scale during a clinical examination. Intake of α- (ALA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), docosapentaenoic (DPA), and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) were evaluated by dietary source using ten 24-h dietary record questionnaires during the first 2.5 years of the follow-up period.After adjustment for possible confounders, severe photoaging was found to be inversely associated with higher intake of ALA in men and with higher intake of EPA in women. When considering the different food sources of ALA for men, an inverse association appeared between severe photoaging and ALA from vegetable oils, as well as with ALA from fruit and vegetables, whereas no association was observed for ALA from dairy products. In women, ALA from vegetable oils also tended to be inversely linked to photoaging.These findings suggest a possible benefit effect of n-3 PUFAs on skin aging. Nonetheless, further epidemiological studies are necessary to confirm our results and to gain additional insights into underlying mechanisms.Copyright © 2013 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

However, a prolonged (15 d) butachlor treatment of Aulosira downregulated all the proteins except NusB. Reverse transcription PCR of the protein genes affirmed that aforesaid proteins were the gene products not artifacts.

Although a broad diversity of oxylipins is known in the algae, no CYP74s or related enzymes have been detected in brown algae yet. Cloning of the first CYP74-related gene CYP5164B1 of brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus is reported in present work. The recombinant protein was incubated with several fatty  hydroperoxides. Linoleic  9-hydroperoxide (9-HPOD) was the preferred substrate, while linoleate 13-hydroperoxide (13-HPOD) was less efficient. α- 9- and 13-hydroperoxides, as well as eicosapentaenoic  15-hydroperoxide were inefficient substrates. Both 9-HPOD and 13-HPOD were converted into epoxyalcohols. For instance, 9-HPOD was turned primarily into (9S,10S,11S,12Z)-9,10-epoxy-11-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic . Both epoxide and hydroxyl  atoms of the epoxyalcohol were incorporated mostly from [O]9-HPOD. Thus, the enzyme exhibits the activity of epoxyalcohol synthase (EsEAS). The results show that the EsEAS isomerizes the hydroperoxides into epoxyalcohols via epoxyallylic radical, a common intermediate of different CYP74s and related enzymes. EsEAS can be considered as an archaic prototype of CYP74 family enzymes.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies showed that selenium (Se) status altered the expression of oxylipids and magnitude of inflammatory responses. Although selenoproteins are thought to mediate many of the biological effects of Se, the direct effect of selenoproteins on the production of oxylipids is unknown. Therefore, the role of decreased selenoprotein activity in modulating the production of biologically active oxylipids from macrophages was investigated. Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were collected from wild-type and myeloid-cell-specific selenoprotein knockout mice to analyze oxylipid production by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry as well as oxylipid biosynthetic enzyme and inflammatory marker gene expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Decreased selenoprotein activity resulted in the accumulation of reactive  species, enhanced cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase expression and decreased oxylipids with known anti-inflammatory properties such as arachidonic -derived lipoxin A₄ (LXA₄) and linoleic -derived 9-​oxo-octadecadienoic  (9-oxoODE). Treating RAW 264.7 macrophages with LXA₄ or 9-oxoODE diminished oxidant-induced macrophage inflammatory response as indicated by decreased production of TNFα. The results show for the first time that selenoproteins are important for the balanced biosynthesis of pro- and anti-inflammatory oxylipids during inflammation. A better understanding of the Se-dependent control mechanisms governing oxylipid biosynthesis may uncover nutritional intervention strategies to counteract the harmful effects of uncontrolled inflammation due to oxylipids.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Apple skin was investigated as a source of natural antioxidants. The phenolic compound composition and antioxidant properties of 21 selected apple genotypes were evaluated. The lipid stabilizing ability of the apple skin extracts was examined using an aqueous emulsion system of methyl linolenate. The total phenolic concentrations determined by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry of methanolic extracts of skins of the apple genotypes varied from 150 to 700 mg/100 g DW. The antioxidant capacity measured by Folin-Ciocalteu (16.2 to 34.1 mg GAE/100 g DW), ferric reducing antioxidant power (1.3 to 3.3 g TE/100 g DW),  radical absorbance capacity (5.2 to 14.2 g TE/100 g DW), and percent inhibition of oxidation of methyl linolenate (73.8% to 97.2%) varied among the apple genotypes.

Camelina sativa L. belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is frequently used as a natural vegetable oil source, as its seeds contain a high content of fatty acids. In this study, we observed that, when subjected to heavy metals (Cd, Co, Zn and Pb), the seeds of CsHMA3 (Heavy-Metal P1B-ATPase 3) transgenic lines retained their original golden yellow color and smooth outline, unlike wild-type seeds. Furthermore, we investigated the fatty acids content and composition of wild type and CsHMA3 transgenic lines after heavy metal treatments compared to the control. The results showed higher total fatty  amounts in seeds of CsHMA3 transgenic lines compared with those in wild-type seeds under heavy-metal stresses. In addition, the compositions of unsaturated fatty acids-especially 18:1 (oleic ), 18:2 (linoleic ; only in case of Co treatment), 18:3 () and 20:1 (eicosenoic )-in CsHMA3 overexpressing transgenic lines treated with heavy metals were higher than those of wild-type seeds under the same conditions. Furthermore, reactive  species (ROS) contents in wild-type leaves and roots when treated with heavy metal were higher than in CsHMA3 overexpressing transgenic lines. These results indicate that overexpression of CsHMA3 affects fatty  composition and content-factors that are responsible for the fuel properties of biodiesel-and can alleviate ROS accumulation caused by heavy-metal stresses in Camelina. Due to these factors, we propose that CsHMA3 transgenic Camelina can be used for phytoremediation of metal-contaminated soil as well as for oil production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26015869>Effect of enteral diet enriched with eicosapentaenoic , gamma-, and antioxidants in patients with sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.</a></h2><p>In this study, the effects of an enteral diet enriched with eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), γ- (GLA), and antioxidants were compared with a standard enteral diet in critically ill patients with sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).This study was a single-center, prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial in our Advanced Critical Care Center. Patients were randomized to receive a continuous EPA, GLA, and antioxidant-enriched diet (study group), or an isocaloric standard diet (control group).Twenty-three of 46 patients were in the study group, and the other 23 were in the control group. Duration of mechanical ventilation, incidence of new nosocomial infections, changes over time in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, and 60-day mortality were not significantly different between the two groups. The ratio of partial pressure of  to fraction of inspired  on day 7 was significantly higher in the study group (233.0 [185.5-282.8] vs. 274.0 [225.5-310.8], p = 0.021). Duration of ICU stay was significantly shorter in the study group than in the control group (24.0 [20.0-30.0] vs. 15.0 [11.0-24.0], p = 0.008).An enteral diet enriched with EPA, GLA, and antioxidants did not improve duration of mechanical ventilation, SOFA score, incidence of new nosocomial infections, or mortality but did favorably influence duration of ICU stay in critically ill patients with sepsis-induced ARDS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21178607>Docosahexaenoic : brain accretion and roles in neuroprotection after brain hypoxia and ischemia.</a></h2><p>With important effects on neuronal lipid composition, neurochemical signaling and cerebrovascular pathobiology, docosahexaenoic  (DHA), a n-3 polyunsaturated fatty , may emerge as a neuroprotective agent against cerebrovascular disease. This paper examines pathways for DHA accretion in brain and evidence for possible roles of DHA in prophylactic and therapeutic approaches for cerebrovascular disease.DHA is a major n-3 fatty  in the mammalian central nervous system and enhances synaptic activities in neuronal cells. DHA can be obtained through diet or to a limited extent via conversion from its precursor, α- (α-LNA). DHA attenuates brain necrosis after hypoxic ischemic injury, principally by modulating membrane biophysical properties and maintaining integrity in functions between presynaptic and postsynaptic areas, resulting in better stabilizing intracellular ion balance in hypoxic-ischemic insult. Additionally, DHA alleviates brain apoptosis, by inducing antiapoptotic activities such as decreasing responses to reactive  species, upregulating antiapoptotic protein expression, downregulating apoptotic protein expression, and maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function.DHA in brain relates to a number of efficient delivery and accretion pathways. In animal models DHA renders neuroprotection after hypoxic-ischemic injury by regulating multiple molecular pathways and gene expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25579219>Comparative real-time study of cellular uptake of a formulated conjugated  rich nano and conventional macro emulsions and their bioactivity in ex vivo models for parenteral applications.</a></h2><p>The objective of the present study was to fabricate and monitor real-time, impact of a stable conjugated , α-eleostearic  (ESA) rich nanoemulsion (NE) formulation (d < 200 nm) vis-à-vis ESA conventional emulsion (CE) system in ex vivo systems against both endogenous and exogenous reactive  species (ROS). Accordingly, stable nanoemulsion formulation of ESA was engineered with the aid of bitter melon seed oil and non-toxic excipients. Morphology and particle size of the emulsion formulations were studied to validate stability. The real-time rapid uptake of the ESA NE and its increased prophylactic efficacy against induced endogenous and exogenous ROS in terms of cell viability and membrane integrity was evaluated flow-cytometrically and with fluorescence microscopic analysis of different primary cells. It was found that the fabricated non-toxic ESA NE had stable parameters (hydrodynamic mean diameter, particle size distribution and zeta potential) for over 12 weeks. Further, ESA NE at a concentration of ∼ 70 μM exhibited maximum efficacy in protecting cells from oxidative damage against both endogenous and exogenous ROS in lymphocytes and hepatocytes as compared to its corresponding presence in the CE formulation. This study provides a real-time empirical evidence on the influence of nano formulation in enhancing bioavailability and antioxidative properties of ESA.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

RAP13 under mixotrophic and heterotrophic modes. The alga grew better and accumulated more lipids under heterotrophic cultivation. Supplementation of biodiesel industry waste glycerol (BDWG) to DE enhanced the biomass production as well as lipid accumulation. While the biomass yield was 0.8g/L for mixotrophic cultivation, it was 1.48g/L and 1.94g/L respectively when cultivated with 4% or 6% BDWG. The cells accumulated 31% lipid when grown in mixotrophic mode, and heterotrophic cultivation with 4% or 6% BDWG resulted in a lipid accumulation of 39% and 42% respectively. Saturated fatty acids production was elevated in the DE, and the major fatty  components of the algal oil were palmitic (16:0), oleic (18:1), stearic (18:0), linoleic (18:2) and  (18:3) acids.

A central composite design with two variables and five levels was employed and effects of process variables of sonication time and extraction temperature on oil recovery and quality were investigated. Optimal conditions predicted by response surface methodology were sonication time of 37 min and extraction temperature of 54°C. Specifically, ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) was able to provide a higher content of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids, whereas conventional Soxhlet extraction (SE) resulted in a higher amount of saturated fatty acids. Moreover, raspberry seed oil contained abundant amounts of edible linoleic  and , which suggest raspberry seeds could be valuable edible sources of natural γ- products.

The present study employed a microwave-assisted method for extraction of raspberry seed oil (RSO). The results revealed that omega-6 fatty acids (linoleic  and γ-) were the major constituents in RSO. Cellular antioxidant enzyme activity such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT) were investigated in HepG2 cells treated with RSO. Induction of the synthesis of several antioxidants in HO-exposed HepG2 cells was found. RSO increased the enzyme activity of SOD, CAT, and GPx in HO-exposed HepG2. Furthermore, RSO inhibited the phosphorylation of upstream mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (c-JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Taken together, the possible mechanisms to increase antioxidant enzyme activities in HepG2 may through the suppression of ERK and JNK phosphorylation. Raspberry seed oil exhibited good effects on the activities of the intracellular antioxidant enzymes and seems to protect the liver from oxidative stress through the inhibition of MAPKs.Copyright © 2017.

Several members have been identified to be regulators for plants response to abscisic  (ABA) signaling. Here, we isolated a subgroup I CDPK gene, ZmCPK4, from maize. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that the ZmCPK4 transcripts were induced by various stresses and signal molecules. Transient and stable expression of the ZmCPK4-GFP fusion proteins revealed ZmCPK4 localized to the membrane. Moreover, overexpression of ZmCPK4 in the transgenic Arabidopsis enhanced ABA sensitivity in seed germination, seedling growth and stomatal movement. The transgenic plants also enhanced drought stress tolerance. Taken together, the results suggest that ZmCPK4 might be involved in ABA-mediated regulation of stomatal closure in response to drought stress.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Many aldehydes are volatile enough to be detected in headspace gases of blood or cultured cells and in exhaled breath, in particular propanal and hexanal which are derived from omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, respectively. Aldehydes are therefore potential non-invasive biomarkers of oxidative stress and of various diseases in which oxidative stress is thought to play a role including cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. It is unclear, however, how changes in the abundance of the fatty  precursors, for example by altered dietary intake, affect aldehyde concentrations. We therefore fed male Wistar rats diets supplemented with either palm oil or a combination of palm oil plus an n-3 fatty  (, eicosapentaenoic, or docosahexaenoic acids) for 4 weeks. Fatty  analysis revealed large changes in the abundance of both n-3 and n-6 fatty acids in the liver with smaller changes observed in the brain. Despite the altered fatty  abundance, headspace concentrations of C1-C8 aldehydes, and tissue concentrations of thiobarbituric  reactive substances, did not differ between the 4 dietary groups. Our data suggest that tissue aldehyde concentrations are independent of fatty  abundance, and further support their use as volatile biomarkers of oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24740480>Characterization of the effects of a polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) on mitochondrial bioenergetics of chronologically aged yeast.</a></h2><p>Increased membrane unsaturation has been associated with shorter longevity due to higher sensitivity to lipid peroxidation (LP) leading to enhanced mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS overproduction. However, the role of LP during aging has been put in doubt along with the participation of electron leak at the electron transport chain (ETC) in ROS generation in aged organisms. Thus, to test these hypothesis and gain further information about how minimizing LP preserves ETC function during aging, we studied the effects of α- (C18:3) on in situ mitochondrial ETC function, ROS production and viability of chronologically aged cells of S. cerevisiae, whose membranes are intrinsically resistant to LP due to the lack of PUFA. Increased sensitivity to LP was observed in cells cultured with C18:3 at 6 days of aging. This was associated with higher viability loss, dissipated membrane potential, impaired respiration and increased ROS generation, being these effects more evident at 28 days. However, at this point, lower sensitivity to LP was observed without changes in the membrane content of C18:3, suggesting the activation of a mechanism counteracting LP. The cells without C18:3 display better viability and mitochondrial functionality with lower ROS generation even at 28 days of aging and this was attributed to full preservation of complex III activity. These results indicate that the presence of PUFA in membranes enhances ETC dysfunction and electron leak and suggest that complex III is crucial to preserve membrane potential and to maintain a low rate of ROS production during aging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26868151>Microalgal growth in municipal wastewater treated in an anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactor.</a></h2><p>Nutrient removal from the effluent of an anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactor (AnMBBR) treated with microalgae was evaluated. Algal treatment was highly efficient in removal of nutrients and discharge limits were met after 3days. Extending the cultivation time from 3 to 5days resulted in a large increase in biomass, from 233.3±49.3 to 530.0±72.1mgL(-1), despite nutrients in the water being exhausted after 3days (ammonium 0.04mgL(-1), orthophosphate <0.05mgL(-1)). Biomass productivity, lipid content and quality did not differ in microalgal biomass produced in wastewater sampled before the AnMBBR. The longer cultivation time resulted in a slight increase in total lipid concentration and a significant decrease in  concentration in all treatments. Differences were observed in chemical  demand, which decreased after algal treatment in wastewater sampled before the AnMBBR whereas it increased after algal treatment in the effluent from the AnMBBR.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Qualitative and quantitative analyses of skin and kernel non-polar extracts (SNP and KNP, respectively) indicated that the major components are fatty acids (696.36 and 879.70 mg g), phytosterols (16.08 and 4.28 mg g), and γ-tocopherol (304.17 and 397.10 μg g). Analysis of the skin and kernel polar extracts (SP and KP, respectively) showed that skin accumulated higher levels of phenolic compounds, especially flavan-3-ols, compared to the kernel. An (epi)catechin hexoside was the major component in SP and KP (9.8 mg g and 3.3 mg g, respectively). Flavan-3-ols with different degrees of polymerization were detected in SP, but only the monomers were identified in the KP. Quercetin glycosides were the major flavonols present in both SP and KP. Bioassays with 3T3L1 mouse adipocytes demonstrated that all extracts decreased lipid accumulation, with SNP demonstrating the highest activity (17% inhibition). Bioassay guided fractionation of SNP indicated that the lipolytic activity was highest in the fraction consisting of linoleic  (20%),  (10%), and β-sitosterol (50%). Radical scavenging assays indicated that all pistachio extracts significantly inhibited ROS, while SP was the most inhibiting to NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Gene expression profiles associated with inflammation (IL6, iNOS, and COX2) were characterized in the LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages after treatment with pistachio extracts.

However, the mechanism underlying the vascular effects induced through flaxseed oil is not well known. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the effects of flaxseed oil on vascular function in isolated rat aortic rings.Wistar rats were treated daily with flaxseed oil or a control (mineral oil) intramuscular (i.m.) for fifteen days. Isolated aortic segments were used to evaluate cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein expression, superoxide anion levels and vascular reactivity experiments.Flaxseed oil treatment increased the vasoconstrictor response of aortic rings to phenylephrine. Endothelium removal increased the response to phenylephrine in aortic segments isolated from both groups, but the effect was smaller in the treated group. L-NAME incubation similarly increased the phenylephrine response in segments from both groups. The TXA2 synthase inhibitor furegrelate, the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS 398, the TP receptor antagonist SQ 29.548, the reactive  species (ROS) scavenger apocynin, the superoxide anion scavengers tiron and the phospholipase A2 inhibitor dexamethasone partially reversed the flaxseed oil-induced increase in reactivity to phenylephrine.These findings suggest that flaxseed oil treatment increased vascular reactivity to phenylephrine through an increase in ROS production and COX-2-derived TXA2 production. The results obtained in the present study provide new insight into the effects of flaxseed oil treatment (i.m.) on vascular function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19661708>Efficient incorporation of free  into volicitin in Spodoptera litura common cutworm larvae.</a></h2><p>Volicitin [N-(17-hydroxylinolenoyl)-L-glutamine] has previously been identified from the lepidopteran larval regurgitant as an elicitor of plant volatile emission.

Compared with thermophilic Arthrospira species occurring naturally in tropical and subtropical lakes, this isolate is mesophilic and grows optimally at ~20 degreesC. The total protein, fatty , phycocyanin, carotenoid, and chlorophyll a contents were 67.6, 6.1, 4.32, 0.29, and 0.76 grams per 100 grams of dry weight, respectively. The strain is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). An essential omega-3 fatty , docosahexaenoic  (DHA), was detected, and gamma- (GLA) and DHA accounted for 28.3% of the total fatty  content. These features of this newly isolated strain make it potentially useful in commercial mass culture in local areas or as a biofuel feedstock.

During a 63-day period, two homogeneous groups of eight lactating Brown cows were allocated to either housing (H) in a free-stall building for 24 h/day. Feeding was based on a total mixed ration or grazing (G) on barley grass for 5 h/day, and housing in a free-stall structure with feeding was based on the same total mixed ration offered to the H group. With regard to behaviour, H cows spent more time idling, walking, drinking, and self-grooming, whereas G cows showed a greater intent to eat and interact socially. Moreover, G cows exhibited slightly higher reactive  metabolites and similar biological antioxidant potential concentrations than the H group, which indicates that short grazing resulted in an almost negligible increase in oxidative stress and an unchanged antioxidant capacity. Skin tests, performed by injecting phytohemoagglutinin intradermally, indicated that G cows had thicker skin than H cows at the end of the trial, an index of a better cell-mediated immune response. Grazing did not affect milk yield but improved milk quality in terms of an increase in fat and a reduction in urea content, somatic cell count, and total microbial count. Milk from G cows was richer in saturated fatty acids, likely because of the contribution of palmitic  present in the grazed barley grass, and also showed higher contents of some healthy fatty acids, such as rumenic  and α-, and a lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio. These results show that including a short grazing time in the diets of organic dairy cows does not have negative consequences for milk production and contributes to improved milk quality as well as to a more efficient immune response in the cows.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26954084>Enhanced cellular uptake of protoporphyrine IX/-conjugated spherical nanohybrids for photodynamic therapy.</a></h2><p>Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) has wide applications in photodynamic diagnosis and photodynamic therapy (PDT) in many human diseases.

The singlet  formation of PPLA nanohybrids on laser irradiation was detected by photoluminescence emission. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis displayed higher cellular internalization of PPLA compared with free PpIX. In addition, PPLA nanohybrids exhibited significantly reduced dark-toxicity and a high phototoxicity mostly because of apoptotic cell death against human gastric cancer cells.

Health status of participants-volunteers and the hypoxia intensity were monitored with a complex of electrophysiological methods: EEC, ECG, measurement of blood pressure, SpO2, evaluation of cardiac output, gas analysis of exhaled air. Using gas chromatography we studied plasma fatty acids total profile (esterificated and non-esterificated) before hypoxia exposure, on 2nd, 5th, 10th, 20th minutes of acute hypoxia and on 5th and 15th minutes of recovery. It was shown that blood saturation value dropped to 52.1 +/- 7.1 % on 25th minute of hypoxia exposure. There were no statistically significant changes in concentrations of total fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated palmitoleic , polyunsaturated linoleic and  acids. Significant (p < 0.05) decrease of concentration of oleic and arachidonic acids was displayed that persisted after 15 minutes of recovery period. It is possible to assume that these changes in unsaturated fatty  concentration were caused by activation of free radical oxidation processes and production of oleic  derivatives.

In leaves, seeds, and husks, about 76, 78, 58% polyunsaturated, 21, 15, 20% saturated, and 3, 7, 22% monounsaturated fatty acids were found, respectively. A range of FAs (C12 to C24) was detected in psyllium and among different plant parts, a high content of the nutritive indicators ω-3  CPS (57%) and ω-6 linoleic  CPS (18%) was detected in leaves. Similarly, total content of phenolics and the essential amino  valine were also detected utmost in leaves followed by sulfur-rich amino acids and flavonoids. In total, 36 different metabolites were identified in psyllium, out of which 26 (13 each) metabolites were detected in leaves and seeds, whereas the remaining 10 were found in the husk. Most of the metabolites are natural antioxidants, phenolics, flavonoids, or alkaloids and can be used as nutrient supplements. Moreover, these metabolites have been reported to have several pharmaceutical applications, including anti-cancer activity. Natural plant ROS scavengers, saponins, were also detected. Based on metabolomic data, the probable presence of a flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was inferred, which provides useful insight for metabolic engineering in the future.

Foc is a soil borne pathogen that causes rot of the roots or wilt of leaves by colonizing the xylem vessels. The dual RNA sequencing is used to simultaneously assess the transcriptomes of pathogen and host. This method greatly helps to understand the responses of pathogen and host to each other and discover the potential pathogenic mechanism.Plantlets of two economically important banana cultivars, Foc TR4 less susceptible cultivar NK and susceptible cultivar BX, were used to research the Foc-banana interaction mechanism. Notably, the infected NK had more significantly up-regulated genes on the respiration machinery including TCA cycle, glyoxylate, glycerol, and glycolysis compared to BX at 27 h post inoculation (hpi). In addition, genes involved in plant-pathogen interaction, starch, sucrose,  and sphingolipid metabolisms were uniquely more greatly induced in BX than those in NK during the whole infection. Genes related to the biosynthesis and metabolism of SA and JA were greatly induced in the infected NK; while auxin and abscisic  metabolisms related genes were strongly stimulated in the infected BX at 27 hpi. Furthermore, most of fungal genes were more highly expressed in the roots of BX than in those of NK. The fungal genes related to pathogenicity, pectin and chitin metabolism, reactive  scavenging played the important roles during the infection of Foc. CCP1 (cytochrome c peroxidase 1) was verified to involve in cellulose utilization, oxidative stress response and pathogenicity of fungus.The transcriptome indicated that NK had much faster defense response against Foc TR4 than BX and the expression levels of fungal genes were higher in BX than those in NK. The metabolisms of carbon, nitrogen, and signal transduction molecular were differentially involved in pathogen infection in BX and NK. Additionally, the putative virulence associated fungal genes involved in colonization, nutrition acquirement and transport provided more insights into the infection process of Foc TR4 in banana roots.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21462326>9-oxo-10(E),12(E)-Octadecadienoic  derived from tomato is a potent PPAR α agonist to decrease triglyceride accumulation in mouse primary hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Tomato is one of the most common crops worldwide and contains many beneficial compounds that improve abnormalities of lipid metabolism. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of tomato on lipid metabolism is unclear. It has been commonly accepted that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) is one of the most important targets for ameliorating abnormalities of lipid metabolism. Therefore, we focused on the activation of PPARα and attempted to detect active compounds activating PPARα in tomato.To identify such active compounds, we screened fractions of tomato extracts using PPARα luciferase reporter assay. One fraction, rechromatographed-fraction eluted in 57 min (RF57), significantly increased PPARα reporter activity, in which a single compound is detected by LC/MS analysis. On the basis of LC/MS and NMR analyses, we determined the chemical structure of the active compound in RF57 as 9-oxo-10(E),12(E)-octadecadienoic  (9-oxo-ODA). The RF57 fraction significantly increased the mRNA expression levels of PPARα target genes involved in fatty  oxidation and O(2) consumption in mouse primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, RF57 inhibited cellular triglyceride accumulation in the hepatocytes.These findings suggest that tomatoes containing 9-oxo-ODA that acts on PPARα are valuable for ameliorating abnormalities of lipid metabolism.Copyright © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, probiotics, prebiotics, conjugated , long-chain omega-3, -6 and -9-polyunsaturated fatty acids, and bioactive peptides have proved that functional components are equally available in animal products such as milk, fermented milk products and cold-water fish. The way a food is processed affects its functional components. Many processing techniques have been found to lower the concentration of functional components in food. Conversely, other techniques were found to increase them. Hence, in a time when the role of a healthy diet in preventing non-communicable diseases is well accepted, the borderline between food and medicine is becoming very thin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25504420>Utilisation of potato processing wastewater for microbial lipids and γ- production by oleaginous fungi.</a></h2><p>Microbial lipids are considered as the starting material for production of second-generation biofuels and their polyunsaturated fatty acids are rich sources of neutraceuticals. Exploring cheap feedstock for producing microbial lipids is necessary. The present study examined the potential of microbial lipids and γ- (GLA) production by two oleaginous fungi, Aspergillus flavus I16-3 and Mucor rouxii, with potato processing wastewater as a low-cost or no-cost nutrient source.Biochemistry and physiology of two oleaginous fungi, A. flavus I16-3 and M. rouxii, on lipid accumulation showed the two fungi grew well and efficiently utilised the starch in wastewater. On average (P < 0.05), 2.8 and 3.6 g L(-1) of lipids were produced by A. flavus I16-3 and M. rouxii, respectively, with maximum GLA yields of 60 and 100 mg L(-1) . Addition of nutrients to raw wastewater significantly improved (P < 0.05) the lipid and GLA yields; 3.5 and 4.2 g L(-1) of lipids, and 100 and 140 mg L(-1) of GLA were produced by A. flavus I16-3 and M. rouxii, respectively. In addition, the wastewater was efficiently treated, with soluble chemical  demand, total soluble nitrogen and total soluble phosphorus removals up to 60% and 90%, 100% and 98%, and 92% and 81% by A. flavus I16-3 and M. rouxii, respectively.This study demonstrated an alternative approach to valorise potato processing wastewater to produce microbial lipids and GLA (nutraceuticals).© 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19895457>Prooxidant activity of oxidized alpha-tocopherol in vegetable oils.</a></h2><p>The effect of oxidized alpha-tocopherol on the oxidative stabilities of soybean, corn, safflower, and olive oils and the oxidation of oleic, linoleic, and  acids were studied. The 0, 650, 1300, and 2600 ppm oxidized alpha-tocopherol were added to soybean, corn, safflower, and olive oils and 10000 ppm oxidized alpha-tocopherol to the mixture of oleic, linoleic, and  acids. Samples in the gas-tight vials were stored in the dark for 6 or 35 d at 55 degrees C. The oxidative stabilities of oils were determined by headspace  with GC and peroxide value. Fatty acids were determined by GC. As the concentration of oxidized alpha-tocopherol in soybean, corn, safflower, and olive oils increased, the depletion of headspace  and the peroxide values of oils increased during storage. The prooxidant effects of oxidized alpha-tocopherol on soybean and corn oils with about 55% linoleic  were greater than those on safflower and olive oils with about 12% linoleic , respectively (P < 0.05). The changes of fatty acids during storage showed that the oxidation ratios of oleic, linoleic, and  acids were 1 : 2 : 3, 1 : 12 : 26, and 1 : 8 : 16 after 5, 30, and 35 d of storage, respectively. The oxidation of alpha-tocopherol in oil should be prevented and the oxidized alpha-tocopherol should be removed to improve the oxidative stability of oils.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29407798>Environmentally-realistic concentration of cadmium combined with polyunsaturated fatty acids enriched diets modulated non-specific immunity in rainbow trout.</a></h2><p>Nutrition is crucial to grow healthy fish particularly in a context of pollution, overcrowding and pathogen risks. Nowadays, the search for food components able to improve fish health is increasingly developing. Here, the influence of four dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that are  (ALA, 18:3n-3), linoleic  (LA, 18:2n-6), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6n-3) on the sensitivity of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) juveniles to environmentally realistic cadmium (Cd, 0.3 μg/L) concentration was investigated. Fish diets were designed to ensure the specific abundance of one of these individual PUFAs, and were given for a 4-week pre-conditioning period followed by a 6-week Cd exposure period. Focus was put on growth performance and immune responses following a short (24 h) and a long-term (6 weeks) Cd exposure. For each experimental condition, some fish were submitted to a bacterial challenge (24 h) with Aeromonas salmonicida achromogenes at the end of Cd conditioning period. DHA-enriched diet improved growth performances as compared to LA-enriched diet, but also increased ROS production (after short-term exposure to Cd) that could lead to a higher inflammation status, and some immunity-related genes (at short and long-term exposure). We notably highlighted the fact that even a low, environmentally-realistic concentration, Cd can strongly impact the immune system of rainbow trout, and that specific dietary PUFA enrichment strategies can improve growth performance (DHA-enriched diet), provide protection against oxidative stress (ALA- and EPA-enriched diet) and stimulate non-specific immunity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Progressive linear motion (PLM), viability (Experiments 1-3), ability to penetrate artificial mucus (Experiment 1), reactive  species (ROS; Experiment 2) and superoxide production (Experiment 3) were assessed. Spermatozoa maintained the ability to penetrate artificial mucus up to Day 4, irrespective of treatment. In Experiments 2 and 3, DHA and EPA had detrimental effects on PLM and viability. PA preserved PLM and viability at levels greater than the control (P<0.05), whilst keeping ROS levels to a minimum, particularly on Days 1 and 3 (P<0.01) when ROS generation peaked in other treatments. In contrast, superoxide production peaked on Day 0 (Experiment 3) and declined thereafter with no significant effect of fatty . This study supports the notion that superoxide dominates on Day 0, whereas its breakdown products, hydrogen peroxide and the hydroxyl radical as assessed by CM-H2DCFDA, contribute to ROS generation on subsequent days.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19649246>Punicic  a conjugated  inhibits TNFalpha-induced neutrophil hyperactivation and protects from experimental colon inflammation in rats.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils play a major role in inflammation by releasing large amounts of ROS produced by NADPH-oxidase and myeloperoxidase (MPO). The proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha primes ROS production through phosphorylation of the NADPH-oxidase subunit p47phox on Ser345. Conventional anti-inflammatory therapies remain partially successful and may have side effects. Therefore, regulation of neutrophil activation by natural dietary components represents an alternative therapeutic strategy in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of punicic , a conjugated  fatty  from pomegranate seed oil on TNFalpha-induced neutrophil hyperactivation in vitro and on colon inflammation in vivo.We analyzed the effect of punicic  on TNFalpha-induced neutrophil upregulation of ROS production in vitro and on TNBS-induced rat colon inflammation. Results show that punicic  inhibited TNFalpha-induced priming of ROS production in vitro while preserving formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)-induced response. This effect was mediated by the inhibition of Ser345-p47phox phosphorylation and upstream kinase p38MAPK. Punicic  also inhibited fMLP- and TNFalpha+fMLP-induced MPO extracellular release from neutrophils. In vivo experiments showed that punicic  and pomegranate seed oil intake decreased neutrophil-activation and ROS/MPO-mediated tissue damage as measured by F2-isoprostane release and protected rats from TNBS-induced colon inflammation.These data show that punicic  exerts a potent anti-inflammatory effect through inhibition of TNFalpha-induced priming of NADPH oxidase by targeting the p38MAPKinase/Ser345-p47phox-axis and MPO release. This natural dietary compound may provide a novel alternative therapeutic strategy in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479330>[Oxidative stress in blood leukocytes, pro/antioxidant status and fatty acids composition of pancreas lipids at experimental acute pancreatitis in rats].</a></h2><p>In an experimental model of acute pancreatitis (AP) in rats no alteration in leukocyte's viability was found by flow cytometry as compared to control. After 1 day of AP production of reactive  forms in granulocytes was increased more than 5 times, but after 3 days their level was decreased. Alterations of pro/antioxidant status and specific changes in the fatty  composition in the pancreas were established. With the development of AP, the processes of lipids peroxidation were intensified while antioxidant system was altered, that was evidenced by inflammation in the pancreas. In these conditions, the increase of phospholipase A2 activity was accompanied by significant changes of fatty  composition of the total lipids in the pancreas. This increased relative total content of saturated fatty acids, in particular myristic, palmitic and stearic  increased, while the total content of polyunsaturated essential fatty acids omega-3 (, eicosapentaenoic, dokozapentayenoic, docosahexaenoic) decreased. The preparation containing omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids partially normalized the lipid and fatty acids composition as well as prooxidant-antioxidant system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22697118>Differential effects of linoleic and  fatty acids on spatial and temporal mitochondrial distribution and activity in bovine oocytes.</a></h2><p>Using specific stains and confocal microscope imaging, the patterns of mitochondrial distribution, mitochondrial inner membrane potential and reactive  species (ROS) levels during bovine oocyte maturation were determined in the presence or absence of physiological concentrations of linoleic  (LA; 100µM) or α- (ALA; 50µM). Mitochondrial distribution in control oocytes at 0h was mainly peripheral and changed to a diffused pattern after 1h of culture; this was maintained up to 24h. Mitochondrial clusters were observed during the early hours of maturation (1-4h); the majority of these were arranged in perinuclear fashion. LA supplementation resulted in: (1) delayed redistribution of the mitochondria from a peripheral to a diffuse pattern and a decreased percentages of oocytes showing perinuclear mitochondrial clusters, (2) decreased mitochondrial inner membrane potential at 1 and 24h compared with the control and (3) higher ROS levels, associated with a lower nuclear maturation rate. In contrast, ALA supplementation had no effect on mitochondrial distribution and activity and decreased ROS levels compared with the control; this was associated with an increased nuclear maturation rate. In conclusion, LA induced alterations in mitochondrial distribution and activity as well as increasing ROS levels, which mediate, at least in part, the inhibitory effect on oocyte maturation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18491235>Survival of freeze-dried leuconostoc mesenteroides and Lactobacillus plantarum related to their cellular fatty acids composition during storage.</a></h2><p>Lactic  bacteria strains Lactobacillus plantarum CWBI-B534 and Leuconostoc ssp. mesenteroïdes (L. mesenteroïdes) Kenya MRog2 were produced in bioreactor, concentrated, with or without cryoprotectants. In general, viable population did not change significantly after freeze-drying (p > 0.05). In most cases, viable population for cells added with cryoprotectants was significantly lower than those without (p < 0.05). Cellular fatty acids (CFAs) from the two strains in this study were analyzed before and after freeze-drying. Six CFAs were identified, namely, palmitic (C(16:0)), palmitoleic (C(16:1)), stearic (C(18:0)), oleic (C(18:1)), linoleic (C(18:2)), and  (C(18:3)) acids were identified. Four of them, C(16:0), C(16:1), C(18:0), and C(18:1), make up more than 94% or 93% of the fatty acids in L. mesenteroides and L. plantarum, respectively, with another one, namely, C18:3, making a smaller (on average 5-6%, respectively) contribution. The C(18:2) contributed very small percentages (on average <or= 1%) to the total in each strain. C(16:0) had the highest proportion at most points relative to other fatty acids. Moisture content and water activity (a (w)) increased significantly during the storage period. It was observed that C(16:1)/C(16:0), C(18:0)/C(16:0) and C(18:1)/C(16:0) ratios for freeze-dried L. mesenteroides or L. plantarum, with or without cryoprotectants, did not change significantly during the storage period. According to the packaging mode and storage temperatures, C(18:2)/C(16:0) and C(18:3)/C(16:0) ratios for freeze-dried L. mesenteroides and L. plantarum with or without cryoprotectants decreased as the storage time increased. However, a higher C(18:2)/C(16:0) or C(18:3)/C(16:0) ratio for L. mesenteroides and L. plantarum was noted in the freeze-dried powder held at 4 degrees C or under vacuum and in dark than at 20 degrees C or in the presence of  and light.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21784965>A peroxygenase pathway involved in the biosynthesis of epoxy fatty acids in oat.</a></h2><p>While oat (Avena sativa) has long been known to produce epoxy fatty acids in seeds, synthesized by a peroxygenase pathway, the gene encoding the peroxygenase remains to be determined. Here we report identification of a peroxygenase cDNA AsPXG1 from developing seeds of oat. AsPXG1 is a small protein with 249 amino acids in length and contains conserved heme-binding residues and a calcium-binding motif. When expressed in Pichia pastoris and Escherichia coli, AsPXG1 catalyzes the strictly hydroperoxide-dependent epoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. It prefers hydroperoxy-trienoic acids over hydroperoxy-dienoic acids as  donors to oxidize a wide range of unsaturated fatty acids with cis double bonds. Oleic  is the most preferred substrate. The acyl carrier substrate specificity assay showed phospholipid and acyl-CoA were not effective substrate forms for AsPXG1 and it could only use free fatty  or fatty  methyl esters as substrates. A second gene, AsLOX2, cloned from oat codes for a 9-lipoxygenase catalyzing the synthesis of 9-hydroperoxy-dienoic and 9-hydroperoxy-trienoic acids, respectively, when linoleic (18:2-9c,12c) and  (18:3-9c,12c,15c) acids were used as substrates. The peroxygenase pathway was reconstituted in vitro using a mixture of AsPXG1 and AsLOX2 extracts from E. coli. Incubation of methyl oleate and linoleic  or  with the enzyme mixture produced methyl 9,10-epoxy stearate. Incubation of linoleic  alone with a mixture of AsPXG1 and AsLOX2 produced two major epoxy fatty acids, 9,10-epoxy-12-cis-octadecenoic  and 12,13-epoxy-9-cis-octadecenoic , and a minor epoxy fatty , probably 12,13-epoxy-9-hydroxy-10-transoctadecenoic . AsPXG1 predominately catalyzes intermolecular peroxygenation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19568181>Flaxseed and cardiovascular health.</a></h2><p>Flaxseed and its components may improve cardiovascular health because of their numerous attributes. Flaxseed contains 35% of its mass as oil, of which 55% is  (ALA). Flax meal, which is devoid of oil, contains the lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG). Flaxseed, flaxseed with very low ALA, flaxseed oil, flax lignan complex (FLC), and SDG reduce the development of hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis by 46%, 69%, 0%, 73%, and 34%, respectively, in the rabbit model. FLC and SDG slow the progression of atherosclerosis but have no effect in regression of atherosclerosis. Suppression of atherosclerosis by flaxseed is the result of its lignan content and not the result of ALA content. Suppression of atherosclerosis is associated with lowering of serum lipids and antioxidant activity. Effects of flaxseed on serum lipids in experimental animals are variable from no change to slight reduction. Flaxseed oil does not affect serum lipids, except for a slight reduction in serum triglycerides. Lignan in general reduces serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and raises serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. SDG and its metabolites have antioxidant activity. Flaxseed and flaxseed oil do not have antioxidant activity except they suppress  radical production by white blood cells. Flaxseed oil/ALA has variable effects on inflammatory mediators/markers (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, C-reactive protein, and serum amyloid A). Doses of ALA less than 14 g/d do not affect inflammatory mediators/markers, but 14 g/d or greater reduce inflammatory mediators/markers. Flaxseed oil decreases soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 but has no effect on soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble E-selectin, and monocyte colony-stimulating factor. Flaxseed has variable effects on IL-6, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. FLC reduces plasma levels of C-reactive protein but has no effects on IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, or monocyte chemoattractant protein. Flaxseed has a very small hypotensive effect, but flaxseed oil does not lower blood pressure. However, SDG is a very potent hypotensive agent. Flaxseed oil decreases platelet aggregation and increases platelet activating inhibitor-1 and bleeding time. Flaxseed and FLC have no effect on the hemopoietic system. SDG is a potent angiogenic and antiapoptotic agent that may have a role in cardioprotection in ischemic heart disease. In conclusion, flaxseed, FLC, and SDG, but not flaxseed oil, suppress atherosclerosis, and FLC and SDG slow progression of atherosclerosis but have no effect on regression. Flaxseed oil suppresses  radical production by white blood cells, prolongs bleeding time, and in higher doses suppresses serum levels of inflammatory mediators and does not lower serum lipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19803380>[Novel type of antimicrobial mechanism in host macrophages against mycobacterial infections].</a></h2><p>Macrophages (M(phi)s) play a central role as anti-microbial effector cells in the expression of host resistance to mycobacterial infections. With respect to antimicrobial effector molecules of host M(phi) against mycobacterial pathogens, recent studies suggest the possibility that the reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI)--and reactive  intermediates-independent antimycobacterial mechanism(s) may be crucial for the antimycobacterial function of host M(phi). In this context, we previously found that free fatty acids (FFAs) such as arachidonic  (AA) and  exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against mycobacterial organisms, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). In addition, FFAs in combination with RNI played critical roles in manifestation of the activity of M(phi) against mycobacterial organisms. Moreover, our recent studies have shown the following findings. First, anti-MTB activity of IFN-gamma-activated M(phi)s was specifically blocked by arachidonyl trifluoromethylketone (aTFMK), an inhibitor of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). Second, ATP potentiated the anti-MAC bactericidal activity of M(phi)s cultivated in the presence of clarithromycin and rifamycin. This effect of ATP was closely related to intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and was specifically blocked by aTFMK. Third, intramacrophage translocation of membranous AA molecules to MAC-containing phagosomes was also specifically blocked by aTFMK. In the confocal microscopic observation of MAC-infected M(phi)s, ATP enhanced the intracellular translocation of cPLA2 into MAC-containing phagosomes. These findings suggest that FFAs (especially AA) produced by the enzymatic action of cPLA2 play important roles as antimycobacterial effectors in the expression of M(phi) antimicrobial activity against mycobacterial pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25205950>Painful diabetic neuropathy: an update.</a></h2><p>Diabetes, a silent killer, is a leading cause of neuropathy. Around 50% of diabetic patients develop peripheral neuropathy in 25 years. Painful diabetic neuropathy manifests as burning, excruciating, stabbing or intractable type of pain or presents with tingling or numbness. The pathophysiology of this condition is due to primarily metabolic and vascular factors. There is increase in sorbitol and fructose, glycated endproducts, reactive  species and activation of protein kinase C in the diabetic state. All these factors lead to direct damage to the nerves. The first step in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy is a tight glycaemic control. Currently there is no drug which can halt or reverse the progression of the disease. Most of the therapies prevalent aim at providing symptomatic relief. Antidepressants like tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have good efficacy in controlling the symptoms. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have not shown the same consistent results. Anticonvulsants including pregabalin, gabapentin and lamotrigine have shown good results in the control of symptoms whereas same was not found with carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and topiramate. Topical agents (capsaicin, topical nitrates and topical TCAs) and local anaesthetics have also been used with good results. Use of opioids and non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs although common but is not preferable. The newer therapies under studies are NMDA antagonists, aldose reductase inhibitors, neurotropic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor, Gamma , protein kinase C beta inhibitors, immune therapy, hyperbaric  and alpha lipoic .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29926330>Antialgal effects of α- on harmful bloom-forming Prorocentrum donghaiense and the antialgal mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Harmful algal blooms (HABs) induced by Prorocentrum donghaiense occur frequently and cause a serious threat to the marine ecosystem.

Specifically, the growth, cellular morphology and ultrastructure, reactive  species (ROS) content, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), cytochrome C (Cyt-C), and caspase-9,3 activity of untreated and treated P. donghaiense were investigated. The results showed that ALA significantly inhibited the growth of P. donghaiense. Under ALA exposure, the cellular morphology and ultrastructure were damaged. ALA also induced ROS overproduction in the algal cells, decreased MMP, induced Cyt-C release, and activated caspase-9,3, which strongly relates to algal apoptosis.

The objectives of this study were to compare the effects of CLA and essential fatty acids on the expression of pro and anti- inflammatory cytokines and their protective efficacy against inflammatory status in mammary gland by an in vitro model based on bovine mammary epithelial cells (BME-UV1). Bovine mammary epithelial cells were treated with complete medium containing either 50 µM of cis-9, trans-11 CLA (c9,t11 CLA) or trans-10, cis-12 CLA (t10,c12 CLA) or (α)- (aLnA) or (γ)- (gLnA) or linoleic  (LA). After 48 h by fatty acids administration the cells were treated for 3 h with 20 µM of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce inflammatory stimulus. Reactive  species (ROS) production after treatments was assessed to verify and to compare the potential protection of different fatty acids against LPS-induced oxidative stress. The messenger RNA abundance of bovine pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukine-10 (IL-10)) and peroxisome proliferator receptor-α/γ (PPARγ/α) were determined in BME-UV1 by real-time PCR. The results showed that cells treated with fatty acids and LPS increased ROS production compared with control cells. Among treatments, cells treated with c9,t11 CLA and t10,c12 CLA isomers revealed significant lower levels of ROS production compared with other fatty acids. All fatty acids reduced the gene expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Among fatty acids, t10,c12 CLA, LA and gLnA showed an homogeneous reduction of the three pro-inflammatory cytokines and this may correspond to more balanced and efficient physiological activity and may trigger a better protective effect. The PPARγ gene expression was significantly greater in cells treated with t10,c12 CLA, aLnA and LA, whereas the PPARα gene expression levels were significantly lower in cells treated with all different fatty acids, compared with the control. These results suggest that fatty acids inhibited the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the upregulation of PPARγ expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496224>Mass Spectrometry Characterization of Thiol Conjugates Linked to Polyoxygenated Polyunsaturated Fatty  Species.</a></h2><p>Radical mediated oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is known to generate a series of polyoxygenated cyclic products (PUFA-O,  ≥ 3). Here, we describe the characterization of glutathione (GSH) conjugates bound to polyoxygenated docosahexaenoic (DHA-O,  = 3-9), arachidonic (ARA-O,  = 3-7), α- (ALA-O), and linoleic (LA-O)  species. Similar conjugates were also characterized for -acetylcysteine (NAC) and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Extensive LC-MS/MS characterization using a synthetic α- hydroxy-endoperoxide (ALA-O) derivative revealed at least two types of mechanisms leading to thiol adduction: a mechanism involving the nucleophilic attack by thiolate anion on 1,2-dioxolane to form a sulfenate ester-bonded conjugate and a mechanism involving cleavage of the dioxolane to form a α,β-unsaturated carbonyl followed by the Michael addition reaction. Finally, we detected a GSH conjugate with hydroxy-endoperoxide derived from linoleic  (LA-O) in mice liver. In summary, our study reveals the formation of a series of thiol conjugates that are bound to highly oxygenated PUFA species. GSH conjugates described in our study may potentially play relevant roles in redox and inflammatory processes, especially under high  tension conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20159849>Jasmonate biochemical pathway.</a></h2><p>Plants possess a family of potent fatty -derived wound-response and developmental regulators: the jasmonates. These compounds are derived from the tri-unsaturated fatty acids  (18:3) and, in plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato, 7(Z)-, 10(Z)-, and 13(Z)-hexadecatrienoic  (16:3). The lipoxygenase-catalyzed addition of molecular  to  initiates jasmonate synthesis by providing a 13-hydroperoxide substrate for formation of an unstable allene oxide by allene oxide synthase (AOS). This allene oxide then undergoes enzyme-guided cyclization to produce 12-oxophytodienoic  (OPDA). These first steps take place in plastids, but further OPDA metabolism occurs in peroxisomes. OPDA has several fates, including esterification into plastid lipids and transformation into the 12-carbon prohormone jasmonic  (JA). JA is itself a substrate for further diverse modifications, including the production of jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), which is a major biologically active jasmonate among a growing number of jasmonate derivatives. Each new jasmonate family member that is discovered provides another key to understanding the fine control of gene expression in immune responses; in the initiation and maintenance of long-distance signal transfer in response to wounding; in the regulation of fertility; and in the turnover, inactivation, and sequestration of jasmonates, among other processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31543828>The Physiological Effect of n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (n-3 PUFAs) Intake and Exercise on Hemorheology, Microvascular Function, and Physical Performance in Health and Cardiovascular Diseases; Is There an Interaction of Exercise and Dietary n-3 PUFA Intake?</a></h2><p>Physical activity has a beneficial effect on systemic hemodynamics, physical strength, and cardiac function in cardiovascular (CV) patients. Potential beneficial effects of dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), such as α-, eicosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic  on hemorheology, vascular function, inflammation and potential to improve physical performance as well as other CV parameters are currently investigated. Recent meta-analysis suggests no effect of n-3 PUFA supplementation on CV function and outcomes of CV diseases. On the other hand, some studies support beneficial effects of n-3 PUFAs dietary intake on CV and muscular system, as well as on immune responses in healthy and in CV patients. Furthermore, the interaction of exercise and dietary n-3 PUFA intake is understudied. Supplementation of n-3 PUFAs has been shown to have antithrombotic effects (by decreasing blood viscosity, decreasing coagulation factor and PAI-1 levels and platelet aggregation/reactivity, enhancing fibrinolysis, but without effects on erythrocyte deformability). They decrease inflammation by decreasing IL-6, MCP-1, TNFα and hsCRP levels, expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules and significantly affect blood composition of fatty acids. Treatment with n-3 PUFAs enhances brachial artery blood flow and conductance during exercise and enhances microvascular post-occlusive hyperemic response in healthy humans, however, the effects are unknown in cardiovascular patients. Supplementation of n-3 PUFAs may improve anaerobic endurance and may modulate  consumption during intense exercise, may increase metabolic capacity, enhance endurance capacity delaying the onset of fatigue, and improving muscle hypertrophy and neuromuscular function in humans and animal models. In addition, n-3 PUFAs have anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects and may attenuate delayed-onset muscle soreness and muscle stiffness, and preserve joint mobility. On the other hand, effects of n-3 PUFAs were variably observed in men and women and they vary depending on dietary protocol, type of supplementation and type of sports activity undertaken, both in healthy and cardiovascular patients. In this review we will discuss the physiological effects of n-3 PUFA intake and exercise on hemorheology, microvascular function, immunomodulation and inflammation and physical performance in healthy persons and in cardiovascular diseases; elucidating if there is an interaction of exercise and diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22380686>Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis of livers from aged rats.</a></h2><p>We used UPLC-Q-TOF MS to analyze hepatic metabolites of rats aged 6, 12, 18, and 24 months; the MS data were processed by partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to investigate the discrimination among sample groups. Rats were significantly separated with increasing age, except those aged between 6 and 12 months. We identified only 25 of 120 metabolites contributing to the separation: lipid metabolites (glycerol-3-phosphate, , lysophosphatidylcholines [lysoPCs]), energy metabolism intermediates (betaine, carnitine, acylcarnitines, creatine, pantothenic ), nucleic  metabolites (inosine, xanthosine, uracil, hypoxanthine, xanthine), and tyrosine. Aging accumulated energy metabolism intermediates, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and 2 major lysoPCs (C18:0 and C22:6). The NAD level and NAD/NADH ratio decreased with age. It was indicated that aging might decrease energy production through β-oxidation because of a decrease in NAD despite the accumulation of lipid energy metabolism intermediates. In addition to energy dysregulation, hypoxanthine and xanthine, which are elevated with age, might accumulate reactive  species in the liver. These results strongly support two aging theories: those of energy dysregulation and free radicals. Additionally, we propose a metabolic pathway related to aging based on these hepatic metabolites. These metabolites and the proposed aging pathway could be used to understand aging and related diseases better, and increase the predictability of aging risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22237170>Value-added oil and animal feed production from corn-ethanol stillage using the oleaginous fungus Mucor circinelloides.</a></h2><p>This study highlights the potential of oleaginous fungus, Mucor circinelloides in adsorbing/assimilating oil and nutrients in thin stillage (TS), and producing lipid and protein-rich fungal biomass. Fungal cultivation on TS for 2 days in a 6-L airlift bioreactor, resulted in a 92% increase in oil yield from TS, and 20 g/L of fungal biomass (dry) with a lipid content of 46% (g of oil per 100g dry biomass). Reduction in suspended solids and soluble chemical  demand (SCOD) in TS were 95% and 89%, respectively. The polyunsaturated fatty acids in fungal oil were 52% of total lipids. Fungal cells grown on Yeast Malt (YM) broth had a higher concentration of γ- (17 wt.%) than those grown on TS (1.4 wt.%). Supplementing TS with crude glycerol (10%, v/v) during the stationary growth phase led to a further 32% increase (from 46% to 61%) in cellular oil content.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Thereby, production of both reactive  intermediates and immune modulating cytokines is crucial for successful pathogen defense. Fatty acids may interfere with immune response in several ways. In this study, we investigated the influence of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on key macrophage functions. RAW264.7 macrophages were cultured in a medium supplemented with 2 or 15 micromol/L of the n-6 PUFA linoleic  (LA) or of the n-3 PUFA  (LNA), respectively. Cells were tested for incorporation of fatty acids as well as NADPH oxidase activity. Furthermore, supernatants were collected for detection of NO and cytokine release (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10). Exposure of RAW264.7 macrophages to LA or LNA resulted in incorporation of these fatty acids and their derivatives. Thereby, supplementation with both LA and LNA caused a significant increase in NADPH oxidase activity. In contrast, synthesis of NO was not affected by PUFA supplementation. Moreover, distinct effects could be seen in the release of immune modulating cytokines. Due to enhancement of NADPH oxidase activity, PUFA presumably promote the killing of pathogens crucial in host defense. In addition, the unsaturated fatty acids tested in our study were shown to modulate cytokine release by the macrophages, thus driving immune response into an anti-inflammatory direction. Of note, distinct differences between the n-6 PUFA LA and the n-3 PUFA LNA underline the impact of PUFA family on immune response.Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Hyperbaric  therapy (HBOT) can significantly improve the outcome of ischemic conditions in IDDM patients and reduce vascular complications. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of HBOT on plasma fatty  (FA) composition, and expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) in IDDM patients.Our study included 24 adult IDDM patients diagnosed with peripheral vascular complications. The patients were exposed to 10 sessions of 100%  inhalation at 2.4 atmosphere absolute for 1 hour. Blood samples were collected at admission and after HBOT for measurement of metabolic parameters, FA composition and IGFBP-1. Measurement of plasma FA composition was determined by gas chromatography. Expression of IGFBP-1 in the serum was estimated by Western blot analysis.HBOT decreased blood levels of total cholesterol (p<0.05), triglycerides (p<0.05) and low-density lipoprotein (p<0.05). HBOT increased plasma levels of individual FAs: palmitic  (p<0.05), palmitoleic  (p<0.05), docosapentaenoic  (p<0.05) and docosahexaenoic  (p<0.01), and decreased levels of stearic  (p<0.05),  (p<0.05) and linoleic  (p<0.01). Expression of IGFBP-1 (p<0.01) was increased, whereas the level of insulin (p<0.001) was decreased in the serum after HBOT.Our results indicate that HBOT exerts beneficial effects in IDDM patients by improving the lipid profile and altering FA composition.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Diabetes Association.

In animal systems, NO2-FAs are considered novel signaling mediators of cell function based on a proven antiinflammatory response. Nevertheless, the interaction of NO with fatty acids in plant systems has scarcely been studied. Here, we examine the endogenous occurrence of nitro- (NO2-Ln) in Arabidopsis and the modulation of NO2-Ln levels throughout this plant's development by mass spectrometry. The observed levels of this NO2-FA at picomolar concentrations suggested its role as a signaling effector of cell function. In fact, a transcriptomic analysis by RNA-seq technology established a clear signaling role for this molecule, demonstrating that NO2-Ln was involved in plant defense response against different abiotic-stress conditions, mainly by inducing heat shock proteins and supporting a conserved mechanism of action in both animal and plant defense processes. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that NO2-Ln was also involved in the response to oxidative stress conditions, mainly depicted by H2O2, reactive  species, and -containing compound responses, with a high induction of ascorbate peroxidase expression. Closely related to these results, NO2-Ln levels significantly rose under several abiotic-stress conditions such as wounding or exposure to salinity, cadmium, and low temperature, thus validating the outcomes found by RNA-seq technology. Jointly, to our knowledge, these are the first results showing the endogenous presence of NO2-Ln in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and supporting the strong signaling role of these molecules in the defense mechanism against different abiotic-stress situations.© 2016 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Hippophae rhamnoides a naturally growing stress tolerant Himalayan shrub was chosen to understand its stress hardiness mechanism. Comparative proteomic and biochemical analysis were done for pooled berry populations (HrB13 and HrB14) growing in two different environmental conditions. HrB13, growing under sub-optimal environmental conditions exhibited differential abundance of stress responsive proteins, which were the rate limiting enzymes associated with stress-responsive metabolic pathways, including Xanthine dehydrogenase (reactive  species [ROS] signaling), Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (phenylpropanoid pathway), endosomal BRO-1 domain protein (ultraviolet [UV]-light stress), Phosphofructokinase (sugar metabolism) and Ubiquitin thioesterase (protein alterations). Biochemical investigations showed a positive correlation between proteomic plasticity (HrB13) and 1.6 to 15-fold accumulation of downstream adaptive metabolic signatures like enzymes and antioxidants involved in ROS scavenging pathways (Catalase, Ascorbate peroxidase, Glutathione reductase, ascorbate and glutathione content), secondary metabolites (phenolics, flavonoids, carotenoids) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (∝ -  and linoleic ). Interactome and KEGG pathway analysis also supported interactions of differentially accumulated proteins with stress-responsive signaling components involved in physiological pathways associated with stress tolerance. This is the first 'ecophysiolomics' study, showing the response of seabuckthorn to multiple stress conditions via activation of multifactorial acclimation strategies leading to morphological, metabolic and physiological modifications, resulting in dark orange berries in HrB13.

The reinforcement is achieved by substituting the atoms of hydrogen at the bis-allylic methylene of these essential FAs with the isotope deuterium. This substitution leads to a significantly slower oxidation due to the kinetic isotope effect, inhibiting membrane damage. The approach has the advantage of preventing the harmful accumulation of reactive  species (ROS) by inhibiting the propagation of lipid peroxidation while antioxidants potentially neutralize beneficial oxidative species. Here, we developed a model system to mimic the human dietary requirement of omega-3 in  to study the role of deuterated polyunsaturated fatty acids (D-PUFAs). Deuterated trilinolenin [D-TG(54:9)] was sufficient to prevent the accumulation of lipid peroxides and to reduce the accumulation or ROS. Moreover, D-TG(54:9) significantly extended the lifespan of worms under normal and oxidative stress conditions. These findings demonstrate that D-PUFAs can be used as a food supplement to decelerate the aging process, resulting in extended lifespan.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26221973>Envelopment-Internalization Synergistic Effects and Metabolic Mechanisms of Graphene Oxide on Single-Cell Chlorella vulgaris Are Dependent on the Nanomaterial Particle Size.</a></h2><p>The interactions between nanomaterials and cells are fundamental in biological responses to nanomaterials. However, the size-dependent synergistic effects of envelopment and internalization as well as the metabolic mechanisms of nanomaterials have remained unknown. The nanomaterials tested here were larger graphene oxide nanosheets (GONS) and small graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQD). GONS intensively entrapped single-celled Chlorella vulgaris, and envelopment by GONS reduced the cell permeability. In contrast, GOQD-induced remarkable shrinkage of the plasma membrane and then enhanced cell permeability through strong internalization effects such as plasmolysis, uptake of nanomaterials, an oxidative stress increase, and inhibition of cell division and chlorophyll biosynthesis. Metabolomics analysis showed that amino  metabolism was sensitive to nanomaterial exposure. Shrinkage of the plasma membrane is proposed to be linked to increases in the isoleucine levels. The inhibition of cell division and chlorophyll a biosynthesis was associated with decreases in aspartic  and serine, the precursors of chlorophyll a. The increases in mitochondrial membrane potential loss and oxidative stress were correlated with an increase in . The above metabolites can be used as indicators of the corresponding biological responses.

In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the metabolism of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased  lipogenesis and lipid mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation, reduced hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs  in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.

There has been a growing interest in establishing a bio-sustainable production of PUFA in several microorganisms, e.g. in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, PUFAs can also be toxic to cells because of their susceptibility to peroxidation. Here we investigated the negative effects of LA and GLA production on S. cerevisiae by characterizing a strain expressing active Δ6 and Δ12 desaturases from the fungus Mucor rouxii. Previously, we showed that the PUFA-producing strain has low viability, down-regulated genes for oxidative stress response, and decreased proteasome activity. Here we show that the PUFA strain accumulates high levels of reactive  species (ROS) and lipid peroxides, and accumulates damaged proteins. The PUFA strain also showed great increase in metacaspase Yca1p activity, suggesting cells could die by caspase-mediated cell death. When treated with antioxidant vitamin C, ROS, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation were greatly reduced, and the activity of the metacaspase was significantly decreased too, ultimately doubling the lifespan of the PUFA strain. When deleting YCA1, the caspase-like activity and the oxidative stress decreased and although the lifespan was slightly prolonged, the phenotype could not be fully reversed, pointing that Yca1p was not the main executor of cell death.© FEMS 2016.

Squalene, a natural triterpene and an intermediate in the biosynthesis of cholesterol, is known to have active  scavenging activities. Squalane, synthesized by complete hydrogenation of squalene, does not have active  scavenging activities. We examined the effects of oral administration of squalene or squalane on a PD mouse model, which was developed by intracerebroventricular injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Squalene administration 7 days before and 7 days after one 6-OHDA injection prevented a reduction in striatal dopamine (DA) levels, while the same administration of squalane enhanced the levels. Neither squalene nor squalane administration for 7 days changed the levels of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, or superoxide dismutase activities in the striatum. Squalane increased thiobarbituric  reactive substances, a marker of lipid peroxidation, in the striatum. Both squalane and squalene increased the ratio of linoleic / in the striatum. These results suggest that the administration of squalene or squalane induces similar changes in the composition of fatty acids and has no effect on the activities of active  scavenging enzymes in the striatum. However, squalane increases oxidative damage in the striatum and exacerbates the toxicity of 6-OHDA, while squalene prevents it. The effects of squalene or squalane treatment in this model suggest their possible uses and risks in the treatment of PD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28882592>Polyunsaturated fatty acids induce ovarian cancer cell death through ROS-dependent MAP kinase activation.</a></h2><p>Free fatty acids not only play a role in cell membrane construction and energy production but also exert diverse cellular effects through receptor and non-receptor mechanisms. Moreover, epidemiological and clinical studies have so far suggested that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) could have health benefits and the advantage as therapeutic use in cancer treatment. However, the underlying mechanisms of PUFA-induced cellular effects remained to be cleared.

Pharmacological and biochemical analyses demonstrated that cell death induced by DHA and γ-LNA was correlated with activation of JNK and p38 MAP kinases, and further an upstream MAP kinase kinase, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, which is stimulated by reactive  species (ROS). Furthermore, an antioxidant vitamin E attenuated PUFA-induced cell death and MAP kinase activation. These findings indicate that PUFA-induced cell death involves ROS-dependent MAP kinase activation and is a cell type-specific action. A further study of the underlying mechanisms for ROS-dependent cell death induced by PUFAs will lead to the discovery of a new target for cancer therapy or diagnosis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Little is known about ROS reduction through the application of exogenous scavengers. In this study, C60 fullerol, a free radical scavenger, was foliar applied to three-week-old cucumber plants (1 or 2 mg/plant) before exposure to copper ions (5 mg/plant). Results showed that C60 fullerols augmented Cu toxicity by increasing the influx of Cu ions into cells (170% and 511%, respectively, for 1 and 2 mg of C60 fullerols/plant). We further use metabolomics and proteomics to investigate the mechanism of plant response to C60 fullerols. Metabolomics revealed that C60 fullerols up-regulated antioxidant metabolites including 3-hydroxyflavone, 1,2,4-benzenetriol, and methyl trans-cinnamate, among others, while it down-regulated cell membrane metabolites ( and palmitoleic ). Proteomics analysis revealed that C60 fullerols up-regulated chloroplast proteins involved in water photolysis (PSII protein), light-harvesting (CAB), ATP production (ATP synthase), pigment fixation (Mg-PPIX), and electron transport ( Cyt b6f). Chlorophyll fluorescence measurement showed that C60 fullerols significantly accelerated the electron transport rate in leaves (13.3% and 9.4%, respectively, for 1 and 2 mg C60 fullerols/plant).

Shifting of the M. rouxii culture from anaerobic to aerobic conditions resulted in an increase of the biomass and total fatty  content of the M. rouxii culture. In addition, the levels of unsaturated fatty acids were enhanced accompanied by a decrease in the levels of medium- and long-chain saturated fatty acids. These results correspond to the levels of expressions of the Delta(9)-, Delta(12)- and Delta(6)-desaturases genes, all of which were coordinately up-regulated after the shift. The transcriptional response observed was rapid and transient, with the maximal mRNA levels detected between 0.5 h and 1.0 h after the shift. Together, our findings indicate that the anaerobic M. rouxii culture acclimatised to  exposure by modulating fatty  composition that was transcriptionally co-regulated by Delta(9)-, Delta(12)- and Delta(6)-desaturase genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30511840>Lowering Effects of n-3 Fatty  Supplements on Blood Pressure by Reducing Plasma Angiotensin II in Inner Mongolia Hypertensive Patients: A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>Whether n-3 fatty  (FA) has hypotensive actions among Chinese adults remains inconclusive. Hypertensive patients from Inner Mongolia, China ( n = 126) were recruited to a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. We investigated the effects of n-3 FA supplements on blood pressure (BP, mm Hg), plasma concentrations of angiotensin II (Ang II, pg/mL), and nitric  (NO, μmol/L), using fish oil ( n = 41, 4 capsules/day, equivalent to 2 g of eicosapentaenoic  plus docosahexaenoic ) and flaxseed oil ( n = 42, 4 capsules/day, equivalent to 2.5 g of α-). Comparing to the control group (corn oil, n = 43), the mean systolic BP (-4.52 ± 9.28 vs -1.51 ± 9.23, P = 0.040) and the plasma Ang II levels (-12.68 ± 10.87 vs -4.93 ± 9.08, P = 0.023) were significantly lowered in the fish oil group, whereas diastolic BP ( P = 0.285) and plasma NO levels ( P = 0.220) were not. Such findings suggest that marine-based n-3 FA has a hypotensive efficacy in Chinese hypertensive patients possibly through inhibiting Ang II-dependent vasoconstrictions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29545468>Insight into Genes Regulating Postharvest Aflatoxin Contamination of Tetraploid Peanut from Transcriptional Profiling.</a></h2><p>Postharvest aflatoxin contamination is a challenging issue that affects peanut quality. Aflatoxin is produced by fungi belonging to the Aspergilli group, and is known as an acutely toxic, carcinogenic, and immune-suppressing class of mycotoxins. Evidence for several host genetic factors that may impact aflatoxin contamination has been reported, , genes for lipoxygenase (PnLOX1 and PnLOX2/PnLOX3 that showed either positive or negative regulation with  infection), reactive  species, and WRKY (highly associated with or differentially expressed upon infection of maize with ); however, their roles remain unclear. Therefore, we conducted an RNA-sequencing experiment to differentiate gene response to the infection by  between resistant (ICG 1471) and susceptible (Florida-07) cultivated peanut genotypes. The gene expression profiling analysis was designed to reveal differentially expressed genes in response to the infection (infected  mock-treated seeds). In addition, the differential expression of the fungal genes was profiled. The study revealed the complexity of the interaction between the fungus and peanut seeds as the expression of a large number of genes was altered, including some in the process of plant defense to aflatoxin accumulation. Analysis of the experimental data with "keggseq," a novel designed tool for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis, showed the importance of α- metabolism, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, spliceosome, and carbon fixation and metabolism pathways in conditioning resistance to aflatoxin accumulation. In addition, coexpression network analysis was carried out to reveal the correlation of gene expression among peanut and fungal genes. The results showed the importance of WRKY, toll/Interleukin1 receptor-nucleotide binding site leucine-rich repeat (TIR-NBS-LRR), ethylene, and heat shock proteins in the resistance mechanism.Copyright © 2018 by the Genetics Society of America.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142027>Screening of  Lipidic Extract as A New Potential Source of Bioactive Compounds.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have shown that marine algae represent a great source of natural compounds with several properties. The lipidic extract of the seaweed  (Chlorophyta, Cladophorales), one of the dominant species in the Mar Piccolo of Taranto (Mediterranean, Ionian Sea), revealed an antibacterial activity against  and , common pathogens in aquaculture, suggesting its potential employment to control fish and shellfish diseases due to vibriosis and to reduce the public health hazards related to antibiotic use in aquaculture. This extract showed also an antioxidant activity, corresponding to 170.960 ± 16. mmol Trolox equivalent/g ( radical absorbance capacity assay-ORAC) and to 30.554 ± 2.30 mmol Trolox equivalent/g (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay-TEAC). The chemical characterization of the extract, performed by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, highlighted the presence of free, saturated (SAFAs), unsaturated (UFAs) and polyunsaturated (PUFAs) fatty acids. The high content of ω-6 and ω-3 PUFAs confirmed also by gas chromatography indicates the potentiality of this algal species in the production of fortified food. The antibacterial activity seems related to the presence of  present at high density, while the antioxidant activity could be likely ascribable to molecules such as carotenoids and chlorophylls (characterized also by thin-layer chromatography), known for this property.

In addition, treatment with low and medium extract and low ALA concentrations improved serum levels of NO2, NO3 and total WBC count (p<0.001 for all cases). Neutrophil and lymphocyte percentages and serum level of thiol also improved due to treatment with medium extract and low ALA concentration (p<0.01 to p<0.001). Medium extract and low ALA treatment also caused improvement of serum level of CAT and eosinophil percentage as well as SOD level respectively (p<0.01 to p<0.001).

Non-equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasma (NEAPP) is a recently developed, non-thermal technique with possible biomedical applications. Although NEAPP reportedly generates reactive /nitrogen species, electrons, positive ions, and ultraviolet radiation, little research has been done into the use of this technique for conventional free radical biology. Recently, we developed a NEAPP device with high electron density. Electron spin resonance spin-trapping revealed (•)OH as a major product. To obtain evidence of NEAPP-induced oxidative modifications in biomolecules and standardize them, we evaluated lipid peroxidation and DNA modifications in various in vitro and ex vivo experiments. Conjugated dienes increased after exposure to linoleic and α- acids. An increase in 2-thiobarbituric -reactive substances was also observed after exposure to phosphatidylcholine, liposomes or liver homogenate. Direct exposure to rat liver in saline produced immunohistochemical evidence of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal- and acrolein-modified proteins. Exposure to plasmid DNA induced dose-dependent single/double strand breaks and increased the amounts of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. These results indicate that oxidative biomolecular damage by NEAPP is dose-dependent and thus can be controlled in a site-specific manner.

The oxidation was carried out in air at 50 °C and monitored by the gas-liquid chromatography (GC) and the  consumption test. First, it was found that CLnA was most unstable followed by CLA, LN, and LA in decreasing order. Second, analyses of silver ion high-performance liquid chromatography (Ag(+)-HPLC) demonstrated that t,t,t-CLnA isomers had greater stability than c,t,t-CLnA and c,t,c-CLnA isomers.

Pollution, smoking, and the consumption of a Western-style diet are all hypothesized as potential causes.We evaluated the effect of chronic consumption of nuts on changes in conventional semen parameters and the potential mechanisms implicated.The FERTINUTS study was a 14-wk randomized, controlled, parallel trial. A total of 119 healthy men, aged 18-35 y, were allocated to 1 of 2 intervention groups: one group was fed the usual Western-style diet enriched with 60 g of a mixture of nuts/d (nut group), and the other was fed the usual Western-style diet avoiding nuts (control group). Semen and blood samples were collected at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Dietary information was recorded throughout the trial. Changes in conventional semen parameters (pH, volume, sperm count and concentration, motility, and morphology) were determined as primary outcomes. The effect of nut consumption on sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF), reactive  species (ROS) production, chromosome anomalies (X, Y, and 18), total DNA methylation, and microRNA expression were measured in sperm samples as potential causes of the changes in the seminogram.Compared with the control group, improvements in total sperm count (P = 0.002) and vitality (P = 0.003), total motility (P = 0.006), progressive motility (P = 0.036), and morphology of sperm (P = 0.008) were observed in the nut group. Participants in the nut group showed an increase in the consumption of total fat, monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, magnesium, vitamin E, α-, total omega-3 (n-3) and ω-3:ω-6 ratio intake during the intervention. Participants in the nut group showed a significant reduction in SDF (P < 0.001) and in the expression of hsa-miR-34b-3p (P = 0.036). No significant changes in ROS, sperm chromosome anomalies, or DNA methylation were observed between groups.The inclusion of nuts in a Western-style diet significantly improves the total sperm count and the vitality, motility, and morphology of the sperm. These findings could be partly explained by a reduction in the sperm DNA fragmentation.

Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its antioxidative features, this compound in planta and its antioxidant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic  and its major oxidized derivative, carnosol, protect lipids from oxidation. Both compounds preserved  and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet oxygen and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis () leaves against lipid peroxidation. Different levels of carnosic  and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to lipid peroxidation. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidation of lipids, carnosic  was consumed and oxidized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic  is a chemical quencher of ROS. The antioxidative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the lipid oxidation process. Under oxidative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol inhibited lipid peroxidation, contrary to carnosic . Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic , rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various oxidized derivatives of carnosic  were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic oxidation of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic , confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic  takes place in planta.© 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The present study examined the antioxidant activity of capsaicinoid from chili pepper in heated canola oil. The oxidation was conducted at 60, 90, 120, and 180 °C by monitoring  consumption and the decrease in linoleic  and α- in canola oil. At 60 °C, capsaicinoid was more effective against oxidation of canola oil compared with BHT. At higher temperatures of 90, 120, and 180 °C, capsaicinoid possessed an antioxidant activity similar to or slightly weaker that that of BHT. It was found that capsaicinoid prevented canola oil from oxidation in a dose-dependent manner. To study the structure-antioxidant relationship, it was found that the trimethylsiloxy (TMS) derivatives of capsaicinoid did not exhibit any antioxidant activity, suggesting the hydroxyl moiety was the functional group responsible for the antioxidant activity of capsaicinoid. It was concluded that capsaicinoid had the potential to be further explored as a natural antioxidant in foods, particularly spicy foods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22986091>Effects of ambient and elevated level of ozone on Brassica campestris L. with special reference to yield and oil quality parameters.</a></h2><p>Tropospheric ozone (O(3)) has become a serious threat to growth and yield of important agricultural crops over Asian regions including India. Effect of elevated O(3) (ambient+10ppb) was studied on Brassica campestris L. (cv. Sanjukta and Vardan) in open top chambers under natural field conditions. Eight hourly mean ambient O(3) concentration varied from 26.3ppb to 69.5ppb during the growth period. Plants under O(3) exposure showed reductions in photosynthetic rate, reproductive parameters, yield as well as seed and oil quality. Cultivar Sanjukta showed more reduction in photosynthetic characteristics, reproductive structures and seed and oil quality. However, total yield was more affected in Vardan. Exposure of O(3) increased the degree of unsaturation and level of PUFA, ω-6fatty ,  and erucic  in oil indicating the deterioration of its quality. The study further confirmed that there is a correspondence between O(3) induced change in photosynthetic processes, reproductive development and yield and did not find any compensatory response in the final yield.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

All tested polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were oxidized by MnP in the presence of Mn(II) ions but the rate of their oxidation was not directly related to degree of their unsaturation. As it has been shown by monitoring  consumption and conjugated dienes formation the linoleic  was the most easily oxidizable fatty  for MnP/Mn(II) and chelated Mn(III). However, when the lipid peroxidation (LPO) activity was monitored by TBARS formation the  gave the highest results. High accumulation of TBARS was also recorded during peroxidation of linoleic  initiated by MnP/Mn(II). Action of Mn(III)-tartrate on the PUFAs mimics action of MnP in the presence of Mn(II) indicating that Mn(III) ions are involved in LPO initiation. Although in our experiments Mn(III) tartrate gave faster than MnP/Mn(II) initial oxidation of the unsaturated fatty acids with consumption of O(2) and formation of conjugated dienes the process was not productive and did not support further development of LPO. The higher effectiveness of MnP/Mn(II)-initiated LPO system depends on the turnover of manganese provided by MnP. It is proposed that the  consumption assay is the best express method for evaluation of MnP- and Mn(III)-initiated peroxidation of C18 unsaturated fatty acids.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we isolated a microsomal ω-3 FAD gene (CbFAD3) from a cryophyte (Chorispora bungeana) and elucidated its functions in stress tolerance. CbFAD3, exhibiting a high identity to Arabidopsis AtFAD3, was up-regulated by abiotic stresses. Its functionality was verified by heterogonous expression in yeast. Overexpression of CbFAD3 in tobacco constitutively increased C18:3 in both leaves and roots, which maintained the membrane fluidity, and enhanced plant tolerance to cold, drought, and salt stresses. Notably, the constitutively increased C18:3 induced a sustained activation of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase, thereby, changing the stress-induced Ca2+ signaling. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging system, which was positively correlated with the level of C18:3, was also activated in the transgenic lines. Microarray analysis showed that CbFAD3-overexpressing plants increased the expression of stress-responsive genes, most of which are affected by C18:3, Ca2+, or ROS. Together, CbFAD3 confers tolerance to multiple stresses in tobacco through the C18:3-induced integrated regulation of membrane, Ca2+, ROS, and stress-responsive genes. This is in contrast with previous observations that simply attribute stress tolerance to membrane stabilization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21973171>Analysis of the subcellular localisation of lipoxygenase in legume and actinorhizal nodules.</a></h2><p>Plant lipoxygenases (LOXs; EC 1.13.11.12) catalyse the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic (18:2) and α- (18:3(n-3)) and are involved in processes such as stress responses and development. Depending on the regio-specificity of a LOX, the incorporation of molecular  leads to formation of 9- or 13-fatty  hydroperoxides, which are used by LOX itself as well as by members of at least six different enzyme families to form a series of biologically active molecules, collectively called oxylipins. The best characterised oxylipins are the jasmonates: jasmonic  (JA) and its isoleucine conjugate that are signalling compounds in vegetative and propagative plant development. In several types of nitrogen-fixing root nodules, LOX expression and/or activity is induced during nodule development. Allene oxide cyclase (AOC), a committed enzyme of the JA biosynthetic pathway, has been shown to localise to plastids of nodules of one legume and two actinorhizal plants, Medicago truncatula, Datisca glomerata and Casuarina glauca, respectively. Using an antibody that recognises several types of LOX interspecifically, LOX protein levels were compared in roots and nodules of these plants, showing no significant differences and no obvious nodule-specific isoforms. A comparison of the cell-specific localisation of LOXs and AOC led to the conclusion that (i) only cytosolic LOXs were detected although it is generally assumed that the (13S)-hydroperoxy α- for JA biosynthesis is produced in the plastids, and (ii) in cells of the nodule vascular tissue that contain AOC, no LOX protein could be detected.© 2011 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28959287>Reduction of Chemical and Biological  Demands from Oil Wastes via Oleaginous Fungi: An Attempt to Convert Food by Products to Essential Fatty Acids.</a></h2><p>The production of waste pollutants has become a major problem for many food and oil industries.

Most of the published research has been on the function of class 1 hemoglobins. To investigate the role of class 2 hemoglobins, transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants were generated overexpressing Arabidopsis hemoglobin-2 (AHb2) under the control of a seed-specific promoter. Overexpression of AHb2 led to a 40% increase in the total fatty  content of developing and mature seeds in three subsequent generations. This was mainly due to an increase in the polyunsaturated C18:2 (ω-6) linoleic and C18:3 (ω-3) α- acids. Moreover, AHb2 overexpression led to an increase in the C18:2/C18:1 and C18:3/C18:2 ratios as well as in the C18:3 content in mol % of total fatty acids and in the unsaturation/saturation index of total seed lipids. The increase in fatty  content was mainly due to a stimulation of the rate of triacylglycerol synthesis, which was attributable to a 3-fold higher energy state and a 2-fold higher sucrose content of the seeds. Under low external , AHb2 overexpression maintained an up to 5-fold higher energy state and prevented fermentation. This is consistent with AHb2 overexpression results in improved  availability within developing seeds. In contrast to this, overexpression of class 1 hemoglobin did not lead to any significant increase in the metabolic performance of the seeds. These results provide evidence for a specific function of class 2 hemoglobin in seed oil production and in promoting the accumulation of polyunsaturated fatty acids by facilitating  supply in developing seeds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30461332>Toxicity of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) to THP-1 macrophages: interactions with saturated or unsaturated free fatty acids.</a></h2><p>In a biological microenvironment, free fatty acids (FFA) as ubiquitous biological molecules might interact with nanoparticles (NPs) and consequently change the toxicological responses. However, whether the chemical structures of FFA could influence their interactions with NPs remain unknown. This study investigated the interactions between ZnO NPs and saturated or unsaturated FFA (complexed to BSA), namely stearic  (SA, C18:0), oleic  (OA, C18:1), and α- (ALA, C18:3). It was shown that BSA, SA, OA, and ALA increased the atomic force microscope (AFM) heights as well the polydispersity index (PDI) of ZnO NPs. BSA modestly protected THP-1 macrophages from ZnO NP exposure, whereas OA and ALA led to relatively less cyto-protective effects of BSA. Moreover, only co-exposure to ZnO NPs and SA significantly promoted the release of interleukin-8. BSA, SA, OA, and ALA equally changed intracellular ROS and Zn ions associated with ZnO exposure, but co-exposure to ZnO NPs and OA/ALA particularly activated the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-apoptosis genes. In combination, these results showed that FFA could influence the colloidal aspects and toxicological signaling pathway of ZnO NPs, which is dependent on the number of unsaturated bonds of FFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29145851>ALA/LA ameliorates glucose toxicity on HK-2 cells by attenuating oxidative stress and apoptosis through the ROS/p38/TGF-β pathway.</a></h2><p>Growing evidence indicates that oxidative stress (OS) plays a pivotal role in Diabetic nephropathy (DN).

However, when grown at 20°C, sy-2 exhibits developmental defects, such as chlorophyll deficiency and shrunken leaves. To understand the underlying mechanism of this temperature-dependent response, phenotypic characterization and genetic analysis were performed. The results revealed abnormal chloroplast structures and cell collapse in leaves of the sy-2 plants grown at 20°C. Moreover, an excessive accumulation of reactive  species (ROS) resulting in cell death was detected in the chlorophyll-deficient sectors of the leaves. However, the expression profile of the ROS scavenging genes did not alter in sy-2 plants grown at 20°C. A further analysis of fatty  content in the leaves showed the impaired pathway of linoleic  (18:2) to  (18:3). Additionally, the Cafad7 gene was downregulated in sy-2 plants. This change may lead to dramatic physiological disorder and alteration of leaf morphology in sy-2 plants by losing low-temperature tolerance. Genetic analysis of an F(2) population from a cross between C. chinense 'sy-2' and wild-type C. chinense 'No. 3341' showed that the sy-2 phenotype is controlled by a single recessive gene.

The resulting hydroperoxides are further metabolized by secondary enzymes to produce a large variety of compounds, including the hormone jasmonic  (JA) and short-chain green leaf volatiles. In flowering plants, which lack arachidonic , oxylipins are produced mainly from oxidation of polyunsaturated C18 fatty acids, notably  and linoleic acids. Algae and mosses in addition possess polyunsaturated C20 fatty acids including arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids, which can also be oxidized by LOXs and transformed into bioactive compounds. Mosses are phylogenetically placed between unicellular green algae and flowering plants, allowing evolutionary studies of the different oxylipin pathways. During the last years the moss Physcomitrella patens has become an attractive model plant for understanding oxylipin biosynthesis and diversity. In addition to the advantageous evolutionary position, functional studies of the different oxylipin-forming enzymes can be performed in this moss by targeted gene disruption or single point mutations by means of homologous recombination. Biochemical characterization of several oxylipin-producing enzymes and oxylipin profiling in P. patens reveal the presence of a wider range of oxylipins compared to flowering plants, including C18 as well as C20-derived oxylipins. Surprisingly, one of the most active oxylipins in plants, JA, is not synthesized in this moss. In this review, we present an overview of oxylipins produced in mosses and discuss the current knowledge related to the involvement of oxylipin-producing enzymes and their products in moss development and defense.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30241083>Metabolic responses of Ulva compressa to single and combined heavy metals.</a></h2><p>Accumulation of metals and metabolic responses were studied for two Cd and Cu concentrations (1 and 10 μM) either alone or as a combination in marine macroalga after 7 days of exposure. Cd accumulated more at a low dose (115 μg of Cd/g DW) but Cu at a high dose (378 μg of Cu/g DW); Cu suppressed Cd accumulation (by 57%). Na and Zn levels were unaffected, but higher metal doses depleted K and Ca levels. Higher metal concentrations strongly stimulated reactive  species and depleted nitric oxide (NO) formation, but differences between the action of Cd and Cu were not extensive. Higher metal doses increased cell wall thickness with a potential relation to NO signal that is visible mainly in the apoplast in those treatments. A higher Cu dose depleted proline, ascorbic , and phenol levels more than Cd, whereas Cd elevated nonprotein thiols and ascorbic  in combined treatments. An eventual role of malic or citric  in metal chelation was not evident: malic  level decreased in all treatments. The total content of fatty acids reached 16.7 mg/g DW in control with the quantitative order of PUFAs > SFAs > MUFAs; palmitic, vaccenic, linoleic, and α- acids were the major compounds. Cu was more toxic for fatty acids than Cd (even at 1 μM); mainly, PUFA levels strongly decreased (from 43% of total acids in control to 28.9% and 5.4% at 1 and 10 μM Cu treatment, respectively). Results are precisely and critically discussed in relation to limited literature focused on macroalgae, and a comparison with microalgae is also provided.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was aimed at investigating the antioxidative potentials of probiotic lactobacilli of Indian gut origin and their ability to augment antioxidant defense enzyme systems in the host cells under oxidative stress conditions. A total of 39 Lactobacillus cultures were assessed for their resistance against reactive  species. Most of the cultures were moderately to strongly resistant towards 0.4 mM H(2)O(2). The Lactobacillus isolate CH4 was the most H(2)O(2) resistant culture with only 0.06 log cycle reduction. Majority of the cultures demonstrated high resistance towards hydroxyl ions and Lp21 was the most resistant with log count reduction of 0.20 fold only. Almost all the cultures were also quite resistant to superoxide anions. Lp21 also showed the highest superoxide dismutase content (0.8971 U). Amongst the 39 cultures, Lactobacillus spp. S3 showed the highest total antioxidative activity of 77.85 ± 0.13 % followed by Lp55 (56.1 ± 1.2 %) in terms of per cent inhibition of  oxidation. Lp9 up-regulated the expression of superoxide dismutase 2 gene in HT-29 cells both at 0.1 mM (1.997 folds) and 1.0 mM H(2)O(2) (2.058 folds) concentrations. In case of glutathione peroxidase-1, Lp9, Lp91 and Lp55 showed significant (P < 0.001) up-regulation in the gene expression to the level of 5.451, 8.706 and 10.083 folds, respectively when HT-29 was challenged with 0.1 mM H(2)O(2). The expression of catalase gene was also significantly up-regulated by all the cultures at 0.1 mM H(2)O(2) conditions. It can be concluded that the antioxidative efficacy of the putative probiotic lactobacilli varied considerably between species and strains and the potential strains can be explored as prospective antioxidants to manage oxidative stress induced diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24082064>Discovery of a linoleate 9S-dioxygenase and an allene oxide synthase in a fusion protein of Fusarium oxysporum.</a></h2><p>Fusarium oxysporum is a devastating plant pathogen that oxidizes C₁₈ fatty acids sequentially to jasmonates. The genome codes for putative dioxygenase (DOX)-cytochrome P450 (CYP) fusion proteins homologous to linoleate diol synthases (LDSs) and the allene oxide synthase (AOS) of Aspergillus terreus, e.g., FOXB_01332. Recombinant FOXB_01332 oxidized 18:2n-6 to 9S-hydroperoxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic  by hydrogen abstraction and antarafacial insertion of molecular  and sequentially to an allene oxide, 9S(10)-epoxy-10,12(Z)-octadecadienoic , as judged from nonenzymatic hydrolysis products (α- and γ-ketols). The enzyme was therefore designated 9S-DOX-AOS. The 9S-DOX activity oxidized C₁₈ and C₂₀ fatty acids of the n-6 and n-3 series to hydroperoxides at the n-9 and n-7 positions, and the n-9 hydroperoxides could be sequentially transformed to allene oxides with only a few exceptions. The AOS activity was stereospecific for 9- and 11-hydroperoxides with S configurations. FOXB_01332 has acidic and alcoholic residues, Glu⁹⁴⁶-Val-Leu-Ser⁹⁴⁹, at positions of crucial Asn and Gln residues (Asn-Xaa-Xaa-Gln) of the AOS and LDS. Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that FOXB_01332 and AOS of A. terreus differ in catalytically important residues suggesting that AOS of A. terreus and F. oxysporum belong to different subfamilies. FOXB_01332 is the first linoleate 9-DOX with homology to animal heme peroxidases and the first 9-DOX-AOS fusion protein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25647712>Development of novel sophorolipids with improved cytotoxic activity toward MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Sophorolipids (SLs) are glycolipid biosurfactants, produced as a mixture of several compounds by some nonpathogenic yeast. In the current study, separation of individual SLs from mixtures with further evaluation of their surface properties and biologic activity on MDA-MB-321 breast cancer cell line were investigated. SLs were biosynthesized by Starmerella bombicola in a culture media supplemented with borage oil. A reverse-phase flash chromatography method with an automated system coupled with a prepacked cartridge was used to separate and purify the main SLs. Compositional analysis of SLs was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry. The following diacetylated lactonic SLs were isolated and purified: C18:0, C18:1, C18:2, and C18:3. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) and surface tension at CMC (γCMC ) of the purified SLs showed an increase with the number of double bonds. High cytotoxic effect against MDA-MB-231 cells was observed with C18:0 and C18:1 lactonic SLs. The cytotoxic effects of C18:3 lactonic SL on cancerous cells were for the first time studied. This cytotoxic effect was considerably higher than the promoted by acidic SLs; however, it induced a lower effect than the previously mentioned SLs, C18:0 and C18:1. To our knowledge, for the first time, C18:1 lactonic SL, in selected concentrations, proved to be able to inhibit MDA-MB-231 cell migration without compromising cell viability and to increase intracellular reactive  species.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22062949>Omega-3 fatty acids enhance mitochondrial superoxide dismutase activity in rat organs during post-natal development.</a></h2><p>The protection of the developing organism from oxidative damage is ensured by antioxidant defense systems to cope with reactive  species (ROS), which in turn can be influenced by dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). PUFAs in membrane phospholipids are substrates for ROS-induced peroxidation reactions. We investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities in rat cerebrum, liver and uterus. Pups born from dams fed a diet low in omega-3 PUFAs were fed at weaning a diet supplying low α- (ALA), adequate ALA or enriched with eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) plus docosahexaenoic  (DHA). Malondialdehyde (MDA), a biomarker of lipid peroxidation, and the activities of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), SOD2, catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were determined in the three target organs. Compared to low ALA feeding, supplementation with adequate ALA or with EPA+DHA did not affect the cerebrum MDA content but increased MDA content in liver. Uterine MDA was increased by the EPA+DHA diet. Supplementation with adequate ALA or EPA+DHA increased SOD2 activity in the liver and uterus, while only the DHA diet increased SOD2 activity in the cerebrum. SOD1, CAT and GPX activities were not altered by ALA or EPA+DHA supplementation. Our data suggest that increased SOD2 activity in organs of the growing female rats is a critical determinant in the tolerance to oxidative stress induced by feeding a diet supplemented with omega-3 PUFAs. This is may be a specific cellular antioxidant response to ROS production within the mitochondria.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The onset of ripening is regulated by a plethora of endogenous signals tuned to external stimuli. In grapevine and tomato, which are classified as non-climacteric and climacteric species respectively, the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and extensive modulation of reactive  species (ROS) scavenging enzymes at the onset of ripening has been reported, suggesting that ROS could participate to the regulatory network of fruit development. In order to investigate this hypothesis, a comprehensive biochemical study of the oxidative events occurring at the beginning of ripening in Vitis vinifera cv. Pinot Noir has been undertaken.ROS-specific staining allowed to visualize not only H2O2 but also singlet  (1O2) in berry skin cells just before color change in distinct subcellular locations, i.e. cytosol and plastids. H2O2 peak in sample skins at véraison was confirmed by in vitro quantification and was supported by the concomitant increase of catalase activity. Membrane peroxidation was also observed by HPLC-MS on galactolipid species at véraison. Mono- and digalactosyl diacylglycerols were found peroxidized on one or both α- fatty  chains, with a 13(S) absolute configuration implying the action of a specific enzyme. A lipoxygenase (PnLOXA), expressed at véraison and localizing inside the chloroplasts, was indeed able to catalyze membrane galactolipid peroxidation when overexpressed in tobacco leaves.The present work demonstrates the controlled, harmless accumulation of specific ROS in distinct cellular compartments, i.e. cytosol and chloroplasts, at a definite developmental stage, the onset of grape berry ripening. These features strongly candidate ROS as cellular signals in fruit ripening and encourage further studies to identify downstream elements of this cascade. This paper also reports the transient galactolipid peroxidation carried out by a véraison-specific chloroplastic lipoxygenase. The function of peroxidized membranes, likely distinct from that of free fatty acids due to their structural role and tight interaction with photosynthesis protein complexes, has to be ascertained.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19213737>Free Fatty Acids and Methyl Jasmonate Trigger Defense Reactions in Laminaria digitata.</a></h2><p>Arachidonic ,  and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) were found to be strong triggers of an oxidative burst in the kelp Laminaria digitata. These findings constitute the first report of an oxidative burst in an algal system induced by free fatty acids. The source of reactive  species can be at least partially inhibited by diphenylene iodonium (DPI). Treatment with arachidonic  increases the levels of a number of free fatty acids [including myristic (C14:0), linoleic (C18:2),  (C18:3) and eicosapentaeneoic (C20:5) acids] and hydroxylated derivatives [such as 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HETE), 13-hydroxyoctadecatrienoic  (13-HOTE) and 15-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic  (15-HEPE)]. Similar to a previous report of the function of an alginate oligosaccharide-triggered oxidative burst in the establishment of resistance in L. digitata against infection by its brown algal endophyte Laminariocolax tomentosoides, C20:4- and MeJA-induced oxidative bursts seem to be involved in establishing the same protection in L. digitata.

DAG-rich oil was derived from triacylglycerol (TAG) oil of extra virgin olive and perilla oil mixture by hydrolysis and re-esterification using lipases. The oxidation of oils was performed at 25 °C for 48 h under singlet  produced with chlorophyll b under light, and was evaluated by headspace  consumption and peroxide value (POV). The oxidation of DAG-rich oil was higher and faster in the co-presence of light and chlorophyll than in their single presence. DAG-rich oil was more oxidation-susceptible than TAG oil. There was no significant change in fatty  and lipid subclass compositions in DAG-rich oil during the photooxidation. Tocopherols were degraded, whereas polyphenols weren't during phootooxidation of DAG-rich oil. The oxidation of DAG-rich oil was well-correlated with tocopherol contents, not with polyphenol contents, indicating that tocopherols were effective antioxidants in the singlet -related phootooxidation of DAG-rich oil. The results suggested that the oxidative stability of DAG-rich oil under singlet  be improved by a precise control through retention of tocopherols.The results of this study can be applied to the utilization of diacylglycerol oils to the area of functional edible oils with good oxidative stability.© 2012 Institute of Food Technologists®</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21481031>Antagonistic role of 9-lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins and ethylene in the control of oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and plant defence.</a></h2><p>9-lipoxygenases (9-LOXs) initiate fatty  oxygenation in plant tissues, with formation of 9-hydroxy-10,12,15-octadecatrienoic  (9-HOT) from . A lox1 lox5 mutant, which is deficient in 9-LOX activity, and two mutants noxy6 and noxy22 (non-responding to oxylipins), which are insensitive to 9-HOT, have been used to investigate 9-HOT signalling. Map-based cloning indicated that the noxy6 and noxy22 mutations are located at the CTR1 (CONSTITUTIVE ETHYLENE RESPONSE1) and ETO1 (ETHYLENE-OVERPRODUCER1) loci, respectively. In agreement, the noxy6 and noxy22 mutants, renamed as ctr1-15 and eto1-14, respectively, showed enhanced ethylene (ET) production. The correlation between increased ET production and reduced 9-HOT sensitivity indicated by these results was supported by experiments in which exogenously added ethylene precursor ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic ) impaired the responses to 9-HOT. Moreover, a reciprocal interaction between ET and 9-HOT signalling was indicated by results showing that the effect of ACC was reduced in the presence of 9-HOT. We found that the 9-LOX and ET pathways regulate the response to the lipid peroxidation-inducer singlet . Thus, the massive transcriptional changes seen in wild-type plants in response to singlet  were greatly affected in the lox1 lox5 and eto1-14 mutants. Furthermore, these mutants displayed enhanced susceptibility to both singlet  and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, in the latter case leading to increased accumulation of the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde. These findings demonstrate an antagonistic relationship between products of the 9-LOX and ET pathways, and suggest a role for the 9-LOX pathway in modulating oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and plant defence.© 2011 The Authors.

However the effect of elaidic  (EA, 18:1 trans fatty ) on ROS generation is not well studied. Rat peritoneal macrophages were enriched with elaidic  by incubating the cells with 80 1M EA. The macrophages containing EA generated higher amounts of superoxide anion (O2*-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO) by 54, 123 and 237%, respectively as compared to control cells which did not contain EA. To study the competition of other C18 fatty acids with EA macrophages were incubated with EA along with stearic  (18:0), oleic  (18:1), linoleic  (18:2) and  (ALA, 18:3). ALA significantly reduced the incorporation of EA into macrophage lipids. This also significantly reduced the generation of O2*-, H2O2, NO by macrophages. Studies were also conducted by feeding rats with diet containing partially hydrogenated vegetable fat (PHVF) as a source for EA and linseed oil (LSO) as a source for ALA. The rats were fed AIN-93 diet containing PHVF with 17% EA and incremental amounts of linseed oil for 10 weeks. The peritoneal macrophages from rats fed partially hydrogenated vegetable fat generated higher levels of O2*-, H2O2, NO by 46, 161 and 76% respectively, when compared to rats fed control diets containing ground nut oil.

Thus they are thought to have biological impacts in stressed plants; however, the detailed mechanism of generation and biochemical effects are unknown. In this study, we show that chloroplasts are major organelles in which malondialdehyde (MDA) generated from peroxidized  modifies proteins in heat-stressed plants. First, to clarify the biochemical process of MDA generation from PUFAs and its attachment to proteins, we carried out in vitro experiments using model proteins (BSA and Rubisco) and methylesters of C18 PUFAs that are major components of plant biomembrane. Protein modification was detected by Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies that recognize MDA binding to proteins. Results showed that peroxidation of  methylester by reactive  species was essential for protein modification by MDA, and the MDA modification was highly dependent on temperature, leading to a loss of Rubisco activity. When isolated spinach thylakoid membrane was peroxidized at 37 degrees C, -evolving complex 33kDa protein (OEC33) was modified by MDA. These model experiments suggest that protein modification by MDA preferentially occurs under higher temperatures and oxidative conditions, thus we examined protein modification in heat-stressed plants. Spinach plants were heat-stressed at 40 degrees C under illumination, and modification of OEC33 protein by MDA was detected. In heat-stressed Arabidopsis plants, light-harvesting complex protein was modified by MDA under illumination. This modification was not observed in -deficient mutants (fad3fad7fad8 triple mutant), suggesting that  is a major source of protein modification by MDA in heat-stressed plants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30154810>Heterologous Expression of a Novel  CH Zinc Finger Gene, , Improved Salt Tolerance in Arabidopsis.</a></h2><p>Growing evidence indicates that some grass species are more tolerant to various abiotic and biotic stresses than many crops.

This study used pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the impact of repeated AMPH exposure and alterations in brain DHA levels on AMPH-induced brain activation patterns. Male rats were fed a diet with no -3 fatty acids (Deficient, DEF,  = 20), a diet fortified with preformed DHA (fish oil, FO,  = 20), or a control diet fortified with  ( = 20) from P21 to P90. During adolescence (P40-60), one-half of each diet group received daily AMPH injections escalated weekly (0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 mg/kg/d) or drug vehicle. Following a 30-d abstinence period blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses were determined in a 7 T Bruker Biospec system following an AMPH challenge (7.5 mg/kg, i.v). Postmortem erythrocyte and forebrain DHA composition were determined by gas chromatography. Compared with control rats, forebrain and erythrocyte DHA levels were significantly lower in DEF rats and significantly higher in FO rats. Across AMPH doses DEF rats exhibited greater locomotor activity compared to control and FO rats. In AMPH-naïve rats, the AMPH challenge increased BOLD activity in the substantia nigra and basal forebrain and no diet group differences were observed. In AMPH-pretreated control and FO rats, the AMPH challenge similarly increased BOLD activation in the bilateral caudate putamen, thalamus, and motor and cingulate cortices. In contrast, BOLD activation in AMPH-pretreated DEF rats was similar to AMPH-naïve DEF animals, and AMPH-pretreated DEF rats exhibited attenuated frontostriatal BOLD activation compared with AMPH-pretreated control and FO rats. These findings demonstrate that chronic escalating AMPH treatment induces enduring frontostriatal recruitment and that peri-adolescent deficits in brain DHA accrual impair this response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20393784>Biosynthesis of unusual moth pheromone components involves two different pathways in the navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella.</a></h2><p>The sex pheromone of the navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), consists of two different types of components, one type including (11Z,13Z)-11,13-hexadecadienal (11Z,13Z-16:Ald) with a terminal functional group containing , similar to the majority of moth pheromones reported, and another type including the unusual long-chain pentaenes, (3Z,6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z)-3,6,9,12,15-tricosapentaene (3Z,6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z-23:H) and (3Z,6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z)- 3,6,9,12,15-pentacosapentaene (3Z,6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z-25:H).

Deuterium-labeled fatty acids, (16,16,16-D(3))-hexadecanoic  and (Z)-[13,13,14,14,15,15,16,16,16-D(9)]-11-hexadecenoic , were incorporated into 11Z,13Z-16:Ald after topical application to the sex pheromone gland coupled with abdominal injection of PBAN. Deuterium label was incorporated into the C(23) and C(25) pentaenes after injection of (9Z,12Z,15Z)- [17,17,18,18,18-D(5)]-9,12,15-octadecatrienoic  into 1-2 d old female pupae. These labeling results, in conjunction with the composition of fatty  intermediates found in pheromone gland extracts, support different pathways leading to the two pheromone components. 11Z,13Z-16:Ald is probably produced in the pheromone gland by Delta11 desaturation of palmitic  to 11Z-16: followed by a second desaturation to form 11Z,13Z-16: and subsequent reduction and oxidation. The production of 3Z,6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z-23:H and 3Z,6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z-25:H may take place outside the pheromone gland, and appears to start from , which is elongated and desaturated to form (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)-5,8,11,14,17-icosapentaenoic , followed by two or three further elongation steps and finally reductive decarboxylation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23663688>Effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids on the growth of gastric cancer cells in vitro.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have tumoricidal action, though the exact mechanism of their action is not clear. The results of the present study showed that of all the fatty acids tested, linoleic  (LA) and α- (ALA) were the most effective in suppressing the growth of normal gastric cells (GES1) at 180 and 200 μM, while gastric carcinoma cells (MGC and SGC) were inhibited at 200 μM. Arachidonic  (AA) suppressed the growth of GES1, MGC and SGC cells and lower concentrations (120 and 160 μM) of AA were more effective against gastric carcinoma (MGC and SGC) cells compared to normal gastric cells (GES1). Paradoxically, both eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids though are more unsaturated than AA, were less effective compared with LA, ALA and AA in suppressing the growth of both normal and cancer cells. At the concentration used, methotrexate showed much less growth suppressive action compared to all the fatty acids tested. PUFAs-treated cells showed accumulation of lipid droplets. A close association was noted between apoptosis and lipid peroxides formed compared to the ability of normal and tumor cells to generate ROS (reactive  species) and induce SOD (superoxide dismutase activity) in response to fatty acids tested and methotrexate. Both normal and tumor cells generated lipoxin A4 (LXA4) in response to supplementation of fatty acids and methotrexate though no significant correlation was noted between their ability to induce apoptosis and LXA4 formed. These results suggest that PUFAs induced apoptosis of normal gastric and gastric carcinoma cells could, partly, be attributed to lipid peroxidation process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18830774>The effects of unsaturated fatty acids on lipid metabolism in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effects of stearic  (saturated), oleic  (monounsaturated), linoleic  (n-6 polyunsaturated), and  (n-3 polyunsaturated) on lipid metabolism in a hepatocyte-derived cell line, HepG2. HepG2 cells were cultured in medium supplemented with either stearic  (0.1% w/v), oleic  (0.1% v/v), linoleic  (0.1% v/v), or  (0.1% v/v). After 24 h, expression of lipid metabolism-associated genes was evaluated by real-time PCR.  showed a suppressive effect on the hepatic fatty  de novo synthesis and fatty  oxidation pathways, while linoleic  also showed a tendency to suppress these pathways although the effect was weaker. Moreover,  enhanced the expression of enzymes associated with reactive  species (ROS) elimination. In contrast, oleic  tended to promote fatty  synthesis and oxidation. In conclusion,  and linoleic  may be expected to ameliorate hepatic steatosis by downregulating fatty  de novo synthesis and fatty  oxidation, and by upregulating ROS elimination enzymes. Oleic  had no distinct effects for improving steatosis or oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28639019>Cultivation of freshwater microalgae in biodiesel wash water.</a></h2><p>Biodiesel wash water is a contaminating industrial effluent that must be treated prior to disposal. The use of this effluent as a low-cost alternative cultivation medium for microalgae could represent a viable supplementary treatment. We cultivated 11 microalgae species with potential use for biodiesel production to assess their growth capacities in biodiesel industrial washing waters. Only Monoraphidium contortum, Ankistrodesmus sp., Chlorococcum sp., and one unidentified Chlorophyceae species grew effectively in that effluent. M. contortum showed the highest growth capacity and had the second highest fatty  content (267.9 mg g of DW), predominantly producing palmitic (20.9%), 7,10,13-hexadecatrienoic (14%), oleic (16.2%), linoleic (10.5%), and  acids (23.2%). In the second phase of the experiment, the microalgae were cultivated in biodiesel wash water at 75% of its initial concentration as well as in WC (control) medium. After 21 days of cultivation, 25.8 and 7.2% of the effluent nitrate and phosphate were removed, respectively, and the chemical  demand was diminished by 31.2%. These results suggest the possibility of cultivating biodiesel producing microalgae in industrial wash water effluents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26512548>Chemical Composition and Antioxidant Capacity of Brazilian Passiflora Seed Oils.</a></h2><p>The seed oils of different varieties of 4 Passiflora species cultivated in Brazil were analyzed and compared regarding their physicochemical parameters, fatty  composition and the presence of minor components, such as phytosterols, tocopherols, total carotenoids, and phenolic compounds. The antioxidant capacities of the oil extracts were determined using the 2,2'azinobis [3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic ] and  radical absorbance capacity methods. The results revealed that all studied Passiflora seed oils possessed similar physicochemical characteristics, except for color, and predominantly contained polyunsaturated fatty acids with a high percentage of  (68.75% to 71.54%). Other than the total phytosterol content, the extracted oil from Passiflora setacea BRS Pérola do Cerrado seeds had higher quantities (% times higher than the average of all samples), of carotenoids (44%), phenolic compounds (282%) and vitamin E (215%, 56%, 398%, and 100% for the α-tocopherol, β-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, and δ-tocopherol isomers, respectively). The methanolic extracts from Passiflora setacea BRS Pérola do Cerrado seed oil also showed higher antioxidant activity, which was positively correlated with the total phenolic, δ-tocopherol, and vitamin E contents. For the first time, these results indicate that Passiflora species have strong potential regarding the use of their seeds for oil extraction. Due to their interesting composition, the seed oils may be used as a raw material in manufacturing industries in addition to other widely used vegetable oils.© 2015 Institute of Food Technologists®</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30732887>Fatty  levels alterations in THP-1 macrophages cultured with lead (Pb).</a></h2><p>As cardiovascular events are one of the main causes of death in developed countries, each factor potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease deserves special attention. One such factor is the potentially atherogenic effect of lead (Pb) on lipid metabolism, and is significant in view of the still considerable Pb environmental pollution and the non-degradability of Pb compounds.Analysis of saturated fatty acids (SFA) (caprylic  (C8:0), decanoic  (C10:0), lauric  (C12:0), tridecanoic  (C13:0), myristic  (C14:0), pentadecanoic  (C15:0), palmitic  (C16:0), heptadecanoic  (C17:0), stearic  (C18:0), and behenic  (C22:0)), monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) (palmitoleic  (C16:1), oleic  (18:1w9), trans-vaccenic  (C18:1 trans11)), and polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) (linoleic  (C18:2n6), gamma- (C18:3n6), arachidonic  (C20:4n6)), was conducted by gas chromatography. Analysis of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1) and fatty  desaturase 2 (FADS2) expression was performed using qRT-PCR. Oxidative stress intensity (malondialdehyde - MDA concentration) was measured using spectrophotometric method. Intracellular generation of reactive  species (ROS) in macrophages was visualized by fluorescence microscopy and quantitatively measured by plate reader.Pb caused quantitative alterations in FAs profile in macrophages; the effect was Pb-concentration dependent and selective (i.e. concerned only selected FAs). In general, the effect of Pb was biphasic, with Pb levels of 1.25 μg/dL and 2.5 μg/dL being stimulatory, and 10 μg/dL being inhibitory on concentrations of selected FAs. The most potent Pb concentration, resulting in increase in levels of 9 FAs, was 2.5 μg/dL, the Pb-level corresponding to the mean blood Pb concentrations of people living in urban areas not contaminated by Pb. Pb was found to exert similar, biphasic effect on the expression of FADS1. However, Pb decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the expression of SCD and FADS2. Pb significantly increased MDA and ROS concentration in macrophages.Environmental Pb exposure might be a risk factor resulting in alterations in FAs levels, oxidative stress and increased MDA concentration in macrophages, which might lead to the formation of foam cells and to inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

To evaluate the phenotypes of biological systems regarding this wide family of compounds, a lipidomics approach in function of time and compartments would be relevant. The current review takes into consideration most of the diverse oxygenated metabolites of essential fatty acids at large and their immediate degradation products.

The yield and quality of sesame are severely affected by high salinity in coastal and semi-arid/arid regions. In this study, the phenotypic, physiological, and proteomic changes induced by salt treatment were analyzed in salt-tolerant (G441) and salt-sensitive (G358) seedlings. Phenotypic and physiological results indicated that G441 had an enhanced capacity to withstand salinity stress compared to G358. Proteomic analysis revealed a strong induction of salt-responsive protein species in sesame, mainly related to catalytic, hydrolase, oxidoreductase, and binding activities. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that more salt-responsive proteins in G441 were involved in tyrosine metabolism, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, carbon metabolism,  metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, photosynthesis, and glutathione metabolism. Furthermore, G441 displayed unique differentially accumulated proteins in seedlings functioning as heat shock proteins, abscisic  receptor PYL2-like, calcium-dependent protein kinases, serine/threonine-protein phosphatases, nucleoredoxin, and antioxidant enzymes. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that some of the proteins were also regulated by salinity stress at the transcript level. Our findings provide important information on salinity responses in plants and may constitute useful resources for enhancing salinity tolerance in sesame. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study identified potential biological pathways and salt-responsive protein species related to transducing stress signals and scavenging reactive  species under salt stress. These findings will provide possible participants/pathways/proteins that contribute to salt tolerance and may serve as the basis for improving salinity tolerance in sesame and other plants.Copyright © 2019.

ROS and RNS can directly damage biomacromolecules such as proteins, DNA, and lipids. Lipid peroxidation, however, can result in reactive carbonyl species (RCS) that can also modify proteins and DNA. In contrast to an extensive literature on the modification of proteins and DNA from omega-6 fatty acids, there are few studies on RCS generation from other fatty acids, particularly omega-3 fatty acids, which are frequently consumed from the diet and diet supplements. Therefore, a comparison between omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids has been conducted. LC-MS/MS analysis of carbonyl-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) standards yielded characteristic fragment ions. Autoxidation products of α- and linoleic  were then derivatized with DNPH and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The results showed that α-, an omega-3 fatty , generated more acrolein and crotonaldehyde than did linoleic , an omega-6 fatty . Omega-3 fatty acids might be easily degraded to smaller monoaldehydes or dicarbonyls. Omega-3 fatty acids have been considered as health improvement components for a long time. However, on the basis of the results presented here, use of omega-3 fatty acids should be re-evaluated in vivo for safety purposes.</p></html>
