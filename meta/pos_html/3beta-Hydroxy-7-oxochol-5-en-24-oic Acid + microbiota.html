The results showed that the  decrease rates of BBP, BBP-8, BBP-16, and BBP-24 were 77.48, 69.61, 56.87, and 52.89%, respectively. The antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of BBPs were decreased under gastrointestinal condition, which might be due to the variation of  during digestion. The bile -binding ability of BBPs showed an -dependent manner for higher  polysaccharides with higher viscosity. Through fermentation, the BBPs affected the ecosystem of the intestinal tract by promoting the production of short-chain fatty , lowering the pH of colon, and decreasing the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. All BBPs showed almost a similar modulation effect on the gut bacteria, but the lower  polysaccharide was more easily utilized by bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667426>Oregano: A potential prophylactic treatment for the intestinal .</a></h2><p>Prophylactic use of antibiotics in poultry diets has been identified as a problematic practice because of its potential to exacerbate the spread of antibiotic resistance to human pathogens. A range of countries have opted to completely ban the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The animal production industries are looking for alternative ways to effectively control pathogens while providing the performance benefits previously secured by antibiotics in feed. Here, we present evidence that oregano () could be a potential alternative for pathogen control in the poultry industry. Broiler diets were supplemented with oregano powder (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2%) for six weeks. The capacity for pathogen control was estimated by  profiling of the jejunum, ileum, and caecum content, and in the faeces, by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The concentrations of short-chain fatty  in the caecal content were also measured, as were villus/crypt parameters in the ileum. There were no differences among treatments in weight gain, feed intake, or the concentration of short-chain fatty . The height, width, and the surface area of villi in the ileum were not influenced by oregano addition. However, 1% and 2% of oregano produced a significant increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio. There were no visible histopathological changes in the liver in control and treated groups. Although oregano had no significant effect on overall microbial diversity and gross composition, some specific genera, like ,  and , which include known pathogens, were reduced in relative abundance by oregano treatment. , recognized as a beneficial and probiotic genus, was also suppressed by the oregano treatment.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590758>Impact of dietary ingredients on the interpretation of various fecal parameters in rats fed inulin.</a></h2><p>In the present study, the influences of diets (i.e. chow and AIN-93 diets) on the interpretation of various fecal parameters including viable , moisture, weight, and short-chain fatty  in rats fed different amounts of inulin (0.5-2 g/kg). Eight groups of rats (n = 8/group) were fed, for 4 weeks, chow or AIN-93 diets with or without inulin supplementation. Fecal samples were analyzed for different fecal parameters. After a 2-week adaptation, apparent differences in some fecal parameters were observed between the chow and AIN-93 diet groups. Throughout the 4-week intervention period, significantly (p < 0.05) higher Lactobacillus spp. counts, fecal moisture (∼2.7-fold), and fecal weight (∼5.8-fold) were observed with chow diet over AIN-93 diet. More specifically, significant elevations in the levels of Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., fecal moisture, and fecal weight could be observed at low-dose (0.5 g/kg) of inulin in chow diet groups, while most of these changes could merely be seen at medium-dose (1 g/kg) in AIN-93 diet groups. These results demonstrated that the choice of experimental diets would affect the comparison of fecal parameters as well as the interpretation of effective dosage of prebiotic in intestinal health assessments.Copyright © 2019.

Cannabidivarin (CBDV) is a safe non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid able to activate and desensitize TRPA1, a member of the TRP channels superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in intestinal inflammation. Here, we have investigated the potential intestinal anti-inflammatory effect of CBDV in mice and in biopsies from pediatric patients with active UC. Colonic inflammation was induced in mice by dinitrobenzenesulfonic  (DNBS). The effect of orally administered CBDV on macroscopic and microscopic damage, inflammatory parameters (i.e. myeloperoxidase activity, intestinal permeability and cytokine production) and faecal  composition, was evaluated 3 days after DNBS administration. TRPA1 expression was studied by RT-PCR in inflamed colons of mice as well as in mucosal colonic biopsies of children with active UC, whose response to incubation with CBDV was also investigated. CBDV attenuates, in a TRPA1-antagonist sensitive manner, DNBS-induced signs of inflammation including neutrophil infiltration, intestinal permeability, and cytokine (i.e. IL-1β, IL-6 and the chemokine MCP-1) production. CBDV also alters the dysregulation of gut  associated to colitis. Finally, CBDV lessens cytokine expression in colonic biopsies from pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis, a condition in which TRPA1 was up-regulated. Our preclinical study shows that CBDV exerts intestinal anti-inflammatory effects in mice via TRPA1, and in children with active UC. Since CBDV has a favorable safety profile in humans, it may be considered for possible clinical trials in patients with UC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Hence, there is a need to strictly examine the biosafety as well as health benefits of probiotics in vivo model system.In this study, two lactic  bacterial (LAB) cultures Lactobacillus fermentum NCMR 2826 and FIX proven for their in vitro probiotic properties were investigated for their in vivo safety in Wistar rats. Acute toxicity study (14 days) with high dose of biomass (10  CFU/mL), followed by sub-chronic test for 13 weeks with oral feeding of the probiotic cultures in three different doses viz; 10, 10 and 10  CFU/mL on daily basis revealed the safety of the L. fermentum cultures. The probiotic feeding had no toxic effects on the survival, body weight, food consumption, with either of the dosage used throughout the treatment period. No statistically significant changes in relative organ weight, serum biochemical and hematological indices were found among the control and the probiotic fed animals. In addition to the safety attributes, the two L. fermentum cultures fed rats showed reduced serum cholesterol levels, macrovesicular steatosis and hepatocyte ballooning compared to control animals. Further, quantification of intestinal  using real-time PCR analysis from animal feces indicated a significant increase and stability of Lactobacillus and bifidobacterial counts but a decrease of E. coli numbers.This study of safety and beneficial features highlight the use of the two native L. fermentum isolates as potential probiotic food supplements.

Previous in vitro studies about biological effects of TCC have yielded a variety of inconsistent results and apparently not been verified in vivo. In the current study, dose-dependent effects of TCC exposure on lipid homeostasis in rats were investigated using a combination of untargeted H NMR metabolomics, targeted metabolite profiling (LC/GC-MS), histopathological assessments, and biological assays. Our results revealed that TCC dose-dependently activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and its transcriptional targets such as  and  in the liver of rats, suggesting that TCC may be a potent AHR agonist. Although TCC exhibited dose-dependent toxicity, oral exposure with relatively low dose TCC caused more significant hepatic lipogenesis of rats than relatively high and moderate doses of TCC. It was mainly manifested by histopathological observations and promotion of de novo fatty , phospholipid, and ceramide biosynthesis and gut  fermentation. Our findings provide new insights into health effects of TCC exposure with different dosages in vivo, especially on the induction and progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and further our understanding in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases induced by environmental pollutants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557944>Mediterranean Native Leguminous Plants: A Reservoir of Endophytic Bacteria with Potential to Enhance Chickpea Growth under Stress Conditions.</a></h2><p>Bacterial endophytes, a subset of a plant's , can facilitate plant growth by a number of different mechanisms. The aims of this study were to assess the diversity and functionality of endophytic bacterial strains from internal root tissues of native legume species grown in two distinct sites in South of Portugal and to evaluate their ability to promote plant growth. Here, 122 endophytic bacterial isolates were obtained from 12 different native legume species. Most of these bacteria possess at least one of the plant growth-promoting features tested in vitro, with indole acetic  production being the most common feature among the isolates followed by the production of siderophores and inorganic phosphate solubilization. The results of in planta experiments revealed that co-inoculation of chickpea plants with specific endophytic bacteria along with N-fixing symbionts significantly improved the total biomass of chickpea plants, in particular when these plants were grown under saline conditions. Altogether, this study revealed that Mediterranean native legume species are a reservoir of plant growth-promoting bacteria, that are also tolerant to salinity and to toxic levels of Mn. Thus, these bacterial endophytes are well adapted to common constraints present in soils of this region which constitutes important factors to consider in the development of bacterial inoculants for stressful conditions in the Mediterranean region.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552753>A critical review on diet-induced  changes and cardiovascular diseases.</a></h2><p> Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) commonly denote the disorders that generally occur as a result of unhealthy food habits. Heart failure, cerebrovascular illness, rheumatic heart disease are the common CVDs. The prevalence of CVD is increased considerably in recent decades upon unhealthy food habits and varied alternative factors such as diabetes, smoking and excessive use of alcohol. A change into a healthy food habit can reverse the strategy during a course of time.  The objective of this review is to summarize the research findings and elaborate the relationship between the diet, gut , and CVD.  The dietary products containing the least saturated, -fat and cholesterol have the tendency to scale back the burden of CVDs, for instance, vegetables and fruits. The potential reason for the cardioprotective activity of the diet ought to be its high-unsaturated fatty  composition and less saturated fat. Recent studies have found that gut  plays a key role in mediating disease prevention. The metabolism of dietary products into varied bioactive metabolites is regulated by gut . The contributory role of gut  in dietary metabolism and CVD prevention studies are increasing with promising outcomes.  Hence, the review was proposed to reach the researchers within this field of study and share the available knowledge in gut -mediated CVD prevention.

Lactic  bacteria contribute the majority of microorganisms with probiotic properties. They have several important mechanisms for intestinal epithelial cell adhesion. In order to adhere to the intestinal cells, they generally use various structures such as flagella, pili, S layer proteins, lipoteichoic , exopolysaccharides and mucus binding proteins. Various in vitro experiments were designed or study models were developed to reveal the mechanisms they utilize for binding to the intestinal cells, yet, the mechanisms for their adhesion are not fully explained. The major disadvantage of conventional models is the lack of layers forming the intestinal mucosa. Besides, these models omit the presence of natural , digestive conditions and the presence of a food matrix. Because of the disadvantages of existing models, natural tissues or novel applications like 3D organ cultures, which are better able to mimic in vivo conditions, are preferred.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649644>Caecal  of Experimentally Infected Chickens at Different Ages.</a></h2><p> is the most common bacterial cause of foodborne zoonosis in the European Union. Infections are often linked to the consumption and handling of poultry meat. The aim of the present study was to investigate the caecal  of birds infected with  at different ages. Therefore, a total of 180 birds of the laying hybrid Lohmann Brown-Classic were housed in 12 subgroups of 15 animals each in three performed repetitions. Three birds per subgroup were experimentally infected with  at an age of about 21 days and about 78 days (4.46 ± 0.35 log CFU/bird). Twenty-one days after experimental infection, microbiome studies were performed on 72 caecal samples of dissected birds (three primary infected and three further birds/subgroup). Amplification within the hypervariable region V 4 of the 16S rRNA gene was performed and sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq platform. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide (version 7.1) and R (version 3.5.2). Both factors, the experimental replication ( < 0.001) and the chickens' age at infection ( < 0.001) contributed significantly to the differences in microbial composition of the caecal samples. The factor experimental replication explained 24% of the sample's variability, whereas the factor age at infection explained 14% thereof. Twelve of 32 families showed a significantly different count profile between the two age groups, whereby strongest differences were seen for seven families, among them the family  (adjusted  = 0.003). The strongest difference between age groups was seen for a bacterial species that is assigned to the genus  which in turn belongs to the family  (adjusted  < 0.0001). Correlation analyses revealed a common relationship in both chicken ages at infection between the absolute abundance of  and , which consists of the genus  In general, concentrations of particular volatile fatty  (VFA) demonstrated a negative correlation to absolute abundance of , whereby the strongest link was seen for n-butyrate (-0.51141;  < 0.0001).

We postulated that diabetes and systemic angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) deficiency would synergize to adversely impact both the microbiome and gut barrier function.  Bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing and metatranscriptomic analysis were performed on fecal samples from WT, ACE2, Akita (type 1 diabetic, T1D), and ACE2-Akita mice. Gut barrier integrity was assessed by immunofluorescence, and BM cell extravasation into the small intestine was evaluated by flow cytometry. In the CE2-Akita or Akita mice, the disrupted barrier was associated with reduced levels of myeloid angiogenic cells (MACs), but no increase in inflammatory monocytes was observed within the gut parenchyma. Genomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of the microbiome of ACE2-Akita mice demonstrated a marked increase in peptidoglycan (PGN) producing bacteria. When compared to control cohorts treated with saline, intraperitoneal administration of MACs significantly decreased the microbiome gene expression associated with PGN biosynthesis and restored epithelial and endothelial gut barrier integrity. Also indicative of diabetic gut barrier dysfunction, increased levels of PGN and intestinal fatty  binding protein-2 (FABP-2) were observed in plasma of human subjects with T1D (n=21) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D, n=23) compared to non-diabetic controls (n=23). Using human retinal endothelial cells, we determined that PGN activates a non-canonical Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) associated MyD88-ARNO-ARF6 signaling cascade, resulting in destabilization of p120-catenin and internalization of VE-cadherin as a mechanism of deleterious impact of PGN on the endothelium.  We demonstrate for the first time that the defect in gut barrier function and dysbiosis in CE2-Akita mice can be favorably impacted by exogenous administration of MACs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616396>SCFAs-Induced GLP-1 Secretion Links the Regulation of Gut Microbiome on Hepatic Lipogenesis in Chickens.</a></h2><p>The impact of gut  and its metabolites on fat metabolism have been widely reported in human and animals. However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in lipid metabolism that liver is the main site of lipid synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut  and fat synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined probiotics (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal  diversity, altered short chain fatty  (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed lipogenesis. In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. GLP-1 suppressed lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut  on hepatic lipogenesis in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554647>Changes in the gut  during and after commercial helium-oxygen saturation diving in China.</a></h2><p>The influence of commercial helium-oxygen saturation diving on divers' gut microbiotas was assessed to provide dietary suggestion.Faecal samples of 47 divers working offshore were collected before (T1), during (T2) and after (T3) saturation diving.

In the present study, we have explored the effect of long-term supplementation with a non-dairy fermented food product (FFP) in Zucker Diabetic and Fatty (ZDF) rats T2D model. The supplementation with FFP induced an improvement in glucose homeostasis according to the results obtained from fasting blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance test, and pancreatic function. Importantly, a significantly reduced intestinal glucose absorption was found in the FFP-treated rats. Supplemented animals also showed a greater survival suggesting a better health status as a result of the FFP intake. Some dissimilarities have been observed in the gut  population between control and FFP-treated rats, and interestingly a tendency for better cardiometabolic markers values was appreciated in this group. However, no significant differences were observed in body weight, body composition, or food intake between groups.

This research evaluates (1) the effectiveness of organic  dissolved in saline solutions to reduce the counts of pathogenic microorganisms in soft and hard wheat, and also investigates the effect of seasonal temperature on (2) survivability of pathogens in wheat kernels and on (3) pathogen inactivation during tempering with saline organic  solutions. Wheat samples were inoculated with cocktails of either 5 serovars of Salmonella enterica, 5 E. coli O157:H7 or 6 non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strains to achieve a concentration of ~7 log CFU/g. Inoculated samples were allowed to stand for 7-days at temperatures (2.0, 10.8, 24.2, 32 °C) corresponding to those experienced during winter, spring/fall, and summer (average and maximum) in the main wheat growing regions in the state of Nebraska, USA. Besides water, solutions containing  (acetic or lactic 2.5% or 5.0% v/v) and NaCl (~26% w/v) were used for tempering the wheat to 15.0% (soft) and 15.5% (hard) moisture at the different seasonal temperatures. The survival of pathogenic microorganisms throughout the resting period, and before and after tempering was analyzed by plating samples on injury-recovery media. The survival rate of pathogenic microorganisms on wheat kernels was higher at temperatures experienced during the winter (2.0 °C) and spring/fall (10.8 °C) months. Regardless of tempering temperature, the initial pathogen load was reduced significantly by all solutions when compared to the control tempered with water (P ≤ .05). The combination of lactic  (5.0%) and NaCl was the most effective treatment against Salmonella enterica, E. coli O157:H7 and non-O157 STEC, with average reduction values of 1.8, 1.8 and 1.6 log CFU/g for soft wheat and 2.6, 2.4 and 2.4 log CFU/g for hard wheat, respectively.

High-throughput Illumina sequencing targeting the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene has been applied to analyze the structure of the intestinal microbiome. Gas chromatography was also used to measure levels of short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), a subset of key gut microbial metabolites mainly produced by Bacteroidetes. We found dramatically decreased gut microbial diversity in individuals with GC-induced obesity. In addition, the bacterial communities of the GC-induced obesity group were enriched in Firmicutes (e.g., genus Streptococcus) and depleted in Bacteroidetes. Furthermore, SCFA content was decreased in GC-induced obesity status. Overall, this study conducted a case-control study with 55 participants in which we analyzed gut  to develop intestinal microbial profiles of patients undergoing long-term treatment with GCs.

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and pathology are frequently reported in PD, including constipation, increased intestinal permeability, glial pathology, and alterations to gut  composition. α-synuclein can propagate through neuronal systems but the site of origin of α-synuclein pathology, whether it be the gut or the brain, is still unknown. Physical exercise is associated with alleviating symptoms of PD and with altering the composition of the gut .This study investigated the effects of bilateral nigral injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-α-synuclein on enteric neurons, glia and neurochemistry, the gut microbiome, and bile  metabolism in rats, some of whom were exposed to voluntary exercise.Nigral overexpression of α-synuclein resulted in significant neuronal loss in the ileal submucosal plexus with no change in enteric glia. In contrast, the myenteric plexus showed a significant increase in glial expression, while neuronal numbers were maintained. Concomitant alterations were observed in the gut microbiome and related bile  metabolism. Voluntary running protected against neuronal loss, increased enteric glial expression, and modified gut microbiome composition in the brain-injected AAV-α-synuclein PD model.These results show that developing nigral α-synuclein pathology in this PD model exerts significant alterations on the enteric nervous system (ENS) and gut microbiome that are receptive to modification by exercise. This highlights brain to gut communication as an important mechanism in PD pathology.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572331>Characterization and Comparison of  in the Gastrointestinal Tracts of the Goat () During Preweaning Development.</a></h2><p>Bacterial communities in gastrointestinal tracts (GIT) play an important role in animal health and performance. Despite its importance, little information is available on the establishment of microbial populations in the goat GIT or on changes occurring during early development. Therefore, this study investigated the bacterial community dynamics of the rumen, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon in 15 goats at five developmental stages (0, 14, 28, 42, and 56 days old) by using 16S rDNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR technology. 940 genera were found to belong to 44 phyla distributed along the GIT. As a whole, the microbial richness and diversity showed a clear increasing trend as the kids aged and alpha diversity differed significantly among GIT compartments mainly occurring at middle day ages (14 and 28 days). Principal coordinate analysis indicated that the bacterial community displayed distinct temporal and spatial specificity along the GIT in preweaning goats. As kids aged, the phylum Firmicutes was replaced by Bacteroidetes in rumen, whereas Proteobacteria in the large intestine was displaced by Firmicutes. The phylum Proteobacteria was mainly present in the small intestine in older animals. In the rumen, taxa, such as  and  decreased and , and unclassified Prevotellaceae increased with the age of kids. Furthermore, a lower proportion of taxa, such as  and  was observed with higher abundances of both  and  in duodenum and jejunum in older animals. In the large intestine, the  displayed taxonomic dynamics with increases of , unclassified , and  as kids aged. Predicted pathway analysis suggested that genes involved in amino  metabolism, and translation were abundant in both rumen and duodenum, while genes involved in membrane transport and carbohydrate metabolism were enriched in the large intestine. These results indicate that both the microbial colonization process and potential function exert a temporal-spatial specificity throughout the GIT of goats. This study provides new insight into the temporal dynamics of GIT  development during preweaning and will aid to develop strategies for improving animal health and downstream production.Copyright © 2019 Li, Zhang, Li, Wang, Chen and Yang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559407>Dietary betaine reduces liver lipid accumulation via improvement of bile  and trimethylamine-N-oxide metabolism in blunt-snout bream.</a></h2><p>Dietary betaine supplementation notably ameliorated fatty liver disease caused by high dietary carbohydrate. We hypothesised that the mechanism behind this is the alteration of bile  and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) metabolism. We further explored this mechanism by supplementing betaine (1%) to the diet of a farmed fish Megalobrama amblycephala. Four diet groups were designed: control (CD, 27.11% carbohydrates), high-carbohydrate (HCD, 36.75% carbohydrates), long-term betaine (HCB, 35.64% carbohydrates; 16 weeks) and short-term betaine (HC4B; 12 weeks HCD + 4 weeks HCB) diets. We analysed the histology of the liver (hematoxylin and eosin staining), the metabolites related to TMAO in plasma (high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry), the expression of the relative gene in the liver and gut  (qPCR), and the composition of gut  (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism). HCD elevated lipid accumulation in the liver and decreased the gene expression of bile  transport, trimethylamine (TMA) formation and the diversity of gut  compared to CD. HCB reversed these patterns, and elevated the gene expression of bile  receptors and decreased the total cholesterol and TMAO concentration (all compared to HCD). HCD and HCB both increased the gene expression of bile  synthesis (all p < 0.05). In conclusion, we hypothesise that HCB decreased liver lipid accumulation caused by a high-carbohydrate diet through improvement of the gut microbial community (the diversity of gut ), TMA formation (the expression of associated microbial genes and bacterial taxa), TMAO metabolism (the formation of TMAO) and bile  metabolism (the gene expression of the synthesis and transport of bile  and their receptors). HC4B produced intermediate effects of those between HCD and HCB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652267>Comparative characterization of bacterial communities in geese consuming of different proportions of ryegrass.</a></h2><p>Geese are extremely well-adapted to utilizing plant-derived roughage in their diet, so the grass must be added to commercial diets under intensive rearing systems. However, it is unclear whether the gut  will change significantly when adding different proportions of ryegrass. In this study, 240 healthy male Yangzhou geese (28 days old) with similar body weights were randomly divided into four groups and fed different proportions grass (CK, whole commercial diets; EG1, ryegrass: commercial diets = 1.5:1; EG2, ryegrass: commercial diets = 2:1; EG3, ryegrass: commercial diets = 3:1) respectively. When the geese grew to 70 days old, their intestines were collected and high-throughput sequencing technology was performed to investigate the microbial diversity in the caecum of geese with different dietary supplements. There was no obvious change in the alpha diversity of gut  of geese with ryegrass intake (P > 0.05) and the composition of dominant bacterium (including Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) was also similar. However, the ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was remarkably reduced with ryegrass intake (P < 0.05), and the relative abundance of 30 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) significantly differed. Additionally, the content of cellulose-degrading  such as Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 were significantly increased in geese fed with increasing amounts of grass. Finally, the functional profiles of the goose gut  were explored using the PICRUSt tool. Carbohydrate metabolism and amino  metabolism were dominant metabolic pathways. Lipid metabolism was significantly increased in EG3 compared that in the CK group (P < 0.05). Interestingly, Turicibacter and Parasutterella may have affected abdominal fat deposition as grass intake increased. Taken together, although the diversity of bacterial communities was similar in geese fed with different proportions of ryegrass, cellulose-degrading  (Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010) were abundant and the lipid metabolic pathway was enriched, which may reduce abdominal fat accumulation in high-ryegrass fed geese.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649646>Microbial Metabolic Capacity for Intestinal Folate Production and Modulation of Host Folate Receptors.</a></h2><p>Microbial metabolites, including B complex vitamins contribute to diverse aspects of human health. Folate, or vitamin B, refers to a broad category of biomolecules that include pterin, para-aminobenzoic  (pABA), and glutamate subunits. Folates are required for DNA synthesis and epigenetic regulation. In addition to dietary nutrients, the gut  has been recognized as a source of B complex vitamins, including folate. This study evaluated the predicted folate synthesis capabilities in the genomes of human commensal microbes identified in the Human Microbiome Project and folate production by representative strains of six human intestinal bacterial phyla. Bacterial folate synthesis genes were ubiquitous across 512 gastrointestinal reference genomes with 13% of the genomes containing all genes required for complete  folate synthesis. An additional 39% of the genomes had the genetic capacity to synthesize folates in the presence of pABA, an upstream intermediate that can be obtained through diet or from other intestinal microbes. Bacterial folate synthesis was assessed during exponential and stationary phase growth through the evaluation of expression of select folate synthesis genes, quantification of total folate production, and analysis of folate polyglutamylation. Increased expression of key folate synthesis genes was apparent in exponential phase, and increased folate polyglutamylation occurred during late stationary phase. Of the folate producers, we focused on the commensal  to examine host-microbe interactions in relation to folate and examined folate receptors in the physiologically relevant human enteroid model. RNAseq data revealed segment-specific folate receptor distribution. Treatment of human colonoid monolayers with conditioned media (CM) from wild-type  did not influence the expression of key folate transporters proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) or reduced folate carrier (RFC). However, CM from  containing a site-specific inactivation of the  gene, which prevents the bacteria from synthesizing a polyglutamate tail on folate, significantly upregulated RFC expression. No effects were observed using  with a site inactivation of , which results in no folate production. This work sheds light on the contributions of microbial folate to overall folate status and mammalian host metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Engevik, Morra, Röth, Engevik, Spinler, Devaraj, Crawford, Estes, Kalkum and Versalovic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636904>Dietary fibre enrichment of supplemental feed modulates the development of the intestinal tract in suckling piglets.</a></h2><p>Commercial pre-weaning diets are formulated to be highly digestible and nutrient-dense and contain low levels of dietary fibre. In contrast, pigs in a natural setting are manipulating fibre-rich plant material from a young age. Moreover, dietary fibre affects gastrointestinal tract (GIT) development and health in older pigs. We hypothesised that supplemental diets that contain vegetal fibres are accelerating GIT development in suckling piglets in terms of size and functionality. From d 2 of life, sow-suckled piglets had access to a low fibre diet (CON), a diet with a fermentable long-chain arabinoxylan (lc-AXOS), a diet with a largely non-fermentable purified cellulose (CELL), or a diet containing both fibres. During the initial 2 weeks, the control diet was a high-density milk replacer, followed by a dry and highly digestible creep meal. Upon weaning at 25 d, 15 piglets from each treatment group, identified as eaters and originating from six or seven litters, were sacrificed for post-mortem examination of GIT morphology, small intestinal permeability and metabolic profile of the digesta. The  composition of the mid-colon was evaluated in a sub-set of ten piglets.No major statistical interactions between the fibre sources were observed. Piglets consumed the fibre-containing milk supplements and creep diets well. Stomach size and small intestinal permeability was not affected. Large intestinal fill was increased with lc-AXOS only, while relative large intestinal weight was increased with both fibre sources ( < 0.050). Also, CELL decreased ileal pH and tended to increase ileal DM content compared to CON ( < 0.050). Moreover, the concentration of volatile fatty  was increased in the caecum ( < 0.100) and mid-colon ( < 0.050) by addition of CELL. lc-AXOS only stimulated caecal propionate ( < 0.050). The  composition showed a high individual variation and limited dietary impact. Nonetheless, CELL induced minor shifts in specific genera, with notable reductions of -.Adding dietary fibres to the supplemental diet of suckling piglets altered large intestinal morphology but not small intestinal permeability. Moreover, dietary fibre showed effects on fermentation and modest changes of microbial populations in the hindgut, with more prominent effects from the low-fermentable cellulose.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668878>Polyphasic characterization of two novel Lactobacillus spp. isolated from blown salami packages: Description of Lactobacillus halodurans sp. nov. and Lactobacillus salsicarnum sp. nov.</a></h2><p> analysis of blown pack spoiled salami revealed five distinguishable Lactobacillus isolates we could not assign to a known species. Two of the isolates (TMW 1.2172 and TMW 1.1920) are rod-shaped, whilst three isolates (TMW 1.2098, TMW 1.2118 and TMW 1.2188) appear coccus shaped or as short rods. All isolates are Gram-stain positive, facultative anaerobic, catalase and oxidase negative, non-motile and non-sporulating. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA, dnaK, pheS and rpoA gene sequences revealed two distinct lineages within the genus Lactobacillus (L.). The isolates are members of the Lactobacillus alimentarius group with Lactobacillus ginsenosidimutans DSM 24154 (99.4% 16S similarity), Lactobacillus versmoldensis DSM 14857 (97.9%) and Lactobacillus furfuricola DSM 27174 (97.7%) as phylogenetic closest related species and L. alimentarius DSM 20249 (97.7%) and Lactobacillus paralimentarius DSM 13961 (97.5%) as closest relatives, respectively. Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values between the isolates and their close related type strains are lower than 80% and 25%, respectively. For both designated type strains, the peptidoglycan type is A4α l-Lys-d-Asp and the major fatty  are C, C and summed feature 7. Based on phylogenetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic analysis we demonstrated that the investigated isolates belong to two novel Lactobacillus species for which we propose the names Lactobacillus salsicarnum with the type strain TMW 1.2098=DSM 109451=LMG 31401and Lactobacillus halodurans with the type strain TMW 1.2172=DSM 109452=LMG 31402.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

An area of fascination and great potential is the human microbiome. Recent studies suggest that the gut  has significant roles in an individual's ability to avoid cancer, with considerable focus on the gut microbiome and colorectal cancer. That in mind, racial disparities with regard to colorectal cancer treatment and prevention are generally understudied despite higher incidence and mortality rates among Non-Hispanic Blacks compared to other racial and ethnic groups in the United States. A comprehension of ethnic differences with relation to colorectal cancer, dietary habits and the microbiome is a meritorious area of investigation. This review highlights literature that identifies and bridges the gap in understanding the role of the human microbiome in racial disparities across colorectal cancer. Herein, we explore the differences in the gut , common short chain fatty  produced in abundance by microbes, and their association with racial differences in cancer acquisition.©The Author(s) 2019.

This trial studied CPSC effects on ruminal fermentation, biohydrogenation and the bacterial community in dairy cows. Ten cows were used in a crossover design with two experimental diets and fed during two 63-day periods. The cows were group fed forage ad libitum and the concentrate individually. The concentrates, control and CPSC, were isoenergetic, isoproteic and isofat. The ruminal samples collected at the end of each experimental period were analyzed for short-chain fatty , FA and DNA sequencing. CPSC decreased butyrate molar proportion (4%,  = 0.005). CPSC decreased C16:0 (28%,  < 0.001) and increased C18:0 (14%,  < 0.001) and total monounsaturated FA, especially C18:1 trans-11 (13%,  = 0.023). The total purine derivative excretion tended to be greater (5%,  = 0.05) with CPSC, resulting in a 6% greater daily microbial N flow. CPSC did not affect the diversity indices but increased the relative abundances of  and , and decreased ,  and .

Novel disease biomarkers and curative treatment options are strongly needed.To apply untargeted metabolomic profiling to identify pathogenic mechanisms and candidate disease biomarkers in FA.Mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomic profiling was performed on serum samples of children with either FA alone, asthma alone or both FA and asthma as well as healthy pediatric controls.In this pilot study FA subjects exhibited a disease-specific metabolomic signature as compared to both control subjects and asthmatics. In particular, FA was uniquely associated with a marked decrease in sphingolipids, as well as a number of other lipid metabolites, in the face of normal frequencies of circulating natural killer T (NKT) cells. Specific comparison of FA and asthmatic subjects revealed differences in the -sensitive aromatic amino  and secondary bile  metabolism. Children with both FA and asthma exhibited a metabolomic profile that aligned with that of FA alone but not asthma. Among children with FA, history of severe systemic reactions and presence of multiple FA were associated with changes in tryptophan metabolites, eicosanoids, plasmalogens, and fatty .Children with FA display a disease-specific metabolomic profile that is informative of disease mechanisms and severity, and which dominates in the presence of asthma. Lower levels of sphingolipids and ceramides and other metabolomic alterations observed in FA children may reflect the interplay between an altered  and immune cell subsets in the gut.Copyright © 2019.

It is usually diagnosed clinically by direct detection of an abnormal pattern of the intestinal . The intermediate diagnosis based on determining the content of microflora metabolites, considered as chemical markers of this disorder, is still rarely used. This is, among others, due to the variety of properties of compounds recognised as dysbiosis markers and as a consequence, the use of different methods for their analysis. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no analytical procedure that would allow unambiguous determination of all compounds in one procedure. In the present study, we have established a detailed method for the quantitative analysis of hydrocinnamic, citramalic, p-hydroxybenzeneacetic, tartaric, hippuric, 4-hydroxybenzoic, indoxylsulfuric, tricarballylic, 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic and benzoic  along with DL-arabitol that employs the direct derivatization of compounds in a small volume of urine sample followed by gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS).

Dietary fiber and phytochemicals are bioactive grain compounds, which could be involved in mediating these beneficial effects. These compounds are not equally distributed in the wheat grain, but are enriched in the bran and aleurone fractions. As little is known on physiological effects of different wheat fractions, the aim of this study was to investigate this aspect in an obesity model. For twelve weeks, C57BL/6J mice were fed high-fat diets (HFD), supplemented with one of four wheat fractions: whole grain flour, refined white flour, bran, or aleurone. The different diets did not affect body weight, however bran and aleurone decreased liver triglyceride content, and increased hepatic n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) concentrations. Furthermore, lipidomics analysis revealed increased PUFA concentration in the lipid classes of phosphatidylcholine (PC), PC-ether, and phosphatidylinositol in the plasma of mice fed whole grain, bran, and aleurone supplemented diets, compared to refined white flour. Furthermore, bran, aleurone, and whole grain supplemented diets increased microbial α-diversity, but only bran and aleurone increased the cecal concentrations of short-chain fatty .

In previous studies we developed a PD animal model exposing pup rats to permethrin (PERM) pesticide. Here, we intended to explore whether in our animal model there were changes in gut permeability, fecal  and hepatic injury. Moreover, we tested if the co-treatment with an electrolyzed reduced (ERW) was effective to protect against alterations induced by PERM. Rats (from postnatal day 6 to 21) were gavaged daily with PERM, PERM+ERW or vehicle and gut, liver and feces were analyzed in 2-months-old rats. Increased gut permeability, measured by FITC-dextran assay, was detected in PERM group compared to control and PERM+ERW groups. In duodenum and ileum, concentration of occludin was higher in control group than those measured in PERM group, whereas only in duodenum ZO-1 was higher in control than those measured in PERM and PERM+ERW groups. Number of inflammatory focis and neutrophils as well as iNOS protein levels were higher in livers of PERM-treated rats than in those of PERM+ERW and control rats. Fecal  analysis revealed that Lachnospira was less abundant and Defluviitaleaceae more abundant in the PERM group, whereas the co-treatment with ERW was protective against PERM treatment since the abundances in Lachnospira and Defluviitaleaceae were similar to those in the control group. Higher abundances of butyrate- producing bacteria such as Blautia, U.m. of Lachnospiraceae family, U.m. of Ruminococcaceae family, Papillibacter, Roseburia, Intestinimonas, Shuttleworthia together with higher butyric  levels were detected in PERM+ERW group compared to the other groups. In conclusion, the PD animal model showed increased intestinal permeability together with hepatic inflammation correlated with altered gut .

Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut  composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut  variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut  by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut , which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649643>Exploring the Link Between the Geographical Origin of European Fermented Foods and the Diversity of Their Bacterial Communities: The Case of Fermented Meats.</a></h2><p>European fermented meat products are prepared according to a wide variety of different recipes and processing conditions, which can influence their fermentative . However, due to the diverse processing conditions applied across Europe, it remained unclear to which degree bacterial heterogeneity can be encountered in commercially available fermented meat products and whether this is linked to their geographical origin. Therefore, the bacterial species diversity of 80 fermented meat products available in the Belgian retail, coming from five different countries, was investigated. It was also assessed how this related to the country of origin and the key processing parameters pH and salt concentration. The samples originated from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. In general, Southern European fermented meat products commonly had a higher pH, with their lactic  bacteria (LAB) communities being represented by  and with mostly  and  governing over the coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) communities. Among these products, the Spanish variants showed a higher prevalence of , whereas  was the prevailing CNS species in most French and Italian fermented meat products. In contrast, Northern European fermented meat products were generally more acidified and showed a higher prevalence of  in their LAB communities, whereas  represented the CNS communities. Non-parametric statistical tests indicated the impact of the geographical origin on the prevalence of the LAB and CNS species. The latter was likely due to the combination of differences in process technology as well as starter culture use.Copyright © 2019 Van Reckem, Geeraerts, Charmpi, Van der Veken, De Vuyst and Leroy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595753>Elaboration of the Comprehensive Metabolic Profile of Salvianolic  A in Vivo and in Vitro Using UFLC-Q/TOF-MS.</a></h2><p>Salvianolic  A (Sal A) has a wide range of pharmacological activities.

However, dietary adherence is challenging to maintain while ensuring adequate nutrition, which can lead to sub-optimal clinical outcomes. Metabolomics offers a systematic approach to identify new biomarkers of disease progression in PKU when using urine as a surrogate for blood specimens that is more accurate than self-reported diet records. Herein, the plasma and urine metabolome of a cohort of classic PKU patients (median age = 11 years; n = 22) mainly prescribed (78%) a Phe-restricted diet were characterized using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS). Overall, there was good mutual agreement between plasma Phe and tyrosine (Tyr) concentrations measured from PKU patients when using an amino  analyzer based on UPLC-UV as compared to MSI-CE-MS with a mean bias of 12% (n = 82). Longitudinal measurements of recently diagnosed PKU infants (n = 3) revealed good long-term regulation of blood Phe with dietary management, and only occasional episodes exceeding the recommended therapeutic range (>360 μM) unlike older PKU patients. Plasma metabolomic studies demonstrated that non-adherent PKU patients had lower circulating concentrations of Tyr, arginine, 2-aminobutyric , and propionylcarnitine (q < 0.05, FDR) that were inversely correlated to Phe (r ≈ -0.600 to -0.830). Nontargeted metabolite profiling also revealed urinary biomarkers associated with poor dietary adherence among PKU patients, including elevated concentrations of catabolites indicative of Phe intoxication (e.g., phenylpyruvic , phenylacetylglutamine, hydroxyphenylacetic ). Additionally, PKU patients with poor blood Phe control had lower excretion of urinary compounds derived from co-metabolism of Tyr due to  activity (e.g., cresol sulfate, phenylsulfate), as well as several metabolites associated with inadequate nutrient intake, including low carnitine and B vitamin status (e.g., folic , vitamin B12). Interestingly, an unknown urinary metabolite was strongly correlated with Phe excretion in PKU patients (r = 0.861), which was subsequently identified as imidazole lactic  when using high resolution MS/MS. Overall, urine profiling offers a non-invasive approach for better treatment monitoring of individual PKU patients, which can also guide the design of novel therapies that improve adherence to Phe-restricted diets without acquired nutritional deficiencies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646148>Gut microbial metabolites in depression: understanding the biochemical mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Gastrointestinal and central function are intrinsically connected by the gut , an ecosystem that has co-evolved with the host to expand its biotransformational capabilities and interact with host physiological processes by means of its metabolic products. Abnormalities in this -gut-brain axis have emerged as a key component in the pathophysiology of depression, leading to more research attempting to understand the neuroactive potential of the products of gut microbial metabolism. This review explores the potential for the gut  to contribute to depression and focuses on the role that microbially-derived molecules - neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty , indoles, bile , choline metabolites, lactate and vitamins - play in the context of emotional behavior. The future of gut-brain axis research lies is moving away from association, towards the mechanisms underlying the relationship between the gut bacteria and depressive behavior. We propose that direct and indirect mechanisms exist through which gut microbial metabolites affect depressive behavior: these include (i) direct stimulation of central receptors, (ii) peripheral stimulation of neural, endocrine, and immune mediators, and (iii) epigenetic regulation of histone acetylation and DNA methylation. Elucidating these mechanisms is essential to expand our understanding of the etiology of depression, and to develop new strategies to harness the beneficial psychotropic effects of these molecules. Overall, the review highlights the potential for dietary interventions to represent such novel therapeutic strategies for major depressive disorder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659726>Growth and Nutrition in Cystic Fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Optimal nutrition support has been integral in the management of cystic fibrosis (CF) since the disease was initially described. Nutritional status has a clear relationship with disease outcomes, and malnutrition in CF is typically a result of chronic negative energy balance secondary to malabsorption. As the mechanisms underlying the pathology of CF and its implications on nutrient absorption and energy expenditure have been elucidated, nutrition support has become increasingly sophisticated. Comprehensive nutrition monitoring and treatment guidelines from professional and advocacy organizations have unified the approach to nutrition optimization around the world. Newborn screening allows for early nutrition intervention and improvement in short- and long-term growth and other clinical outcomes. The nutrition support goal in CF care includes achieving optimal nutritional status to support growth and pubertal development in children, maintenance of optimal nutritional status in adult life, and optimizing fat soluble vitamin and essential fatty  status. The mainstay of this approach is a high calorie, high-fat diet, exceeding age, and sex energy intake recommendations for healthy individuals. For patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, enzyme replacement therapy is required to improve fat and calorie absorption. Enzyme dosing varies by age and dietary fat intake. Multiple potential impediments to absorption, including decreased motility, altered gut luminal bile salt and  composition, and enteric inflammation must be considered. Fat soluble vitamin supplementation is required in patients with pancreatic insufficiency. In this report, nutrition support across the age and disease spectrum is discussed, with a focus on the relationships among nutritional status, growth, and disease outcomes.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623075>Gut Microbiome Modulation Based on Probiotic Application for Anti-Obesity: A Review on Efficacy and Validation.</a></h2><p>The growing prevalence of obesity has become an important problem worldwide as obesity has several health risks. Notably, factors such as excessive food consumption, a sedentary way of life, high sugar consumption, a fat-rich diet, and a certain genetic profile may lead to obesity. The present review brings together recent advances regarding the significance of interventions involving intestinal gut bacteria and host metabolic phenotypes. We assess important biological molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of gut  on hosts including bile salt metabolism, short-chain fatty , and metabolic endotoxemia. Some previous studies have shown a link between  and obesity, and associated disease reports have been documented. Thus, this review focuses on obesity and gut  interactions and further develops the mechanism of the gut microbiome approach related to human obesity. Specifically, we highlight several alternative diet treatments including dietary changes and supplementation with probiotics. The future direction or comparative significance of fecal transplantation, synbiotics, and metabolomics as an approach to the modulation of intestinal microbes is also discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595814>Diversification of host bile  by members of the gut .</a></h2><p>Bile  biotransformation is a collaborative effort by the host and the gut microbiome.

This review aims to 1) describe the physiologic aspects of collaborative bile  metabolism by the host and gut ; 2) to evaluate how gut microbes influence bile  pools, and in turn how bile  pools modulate the gut microbial community structure; 3) to compare species differences in bile  pools; and lastly, 4) discuss the effects of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) administration, a common therapeutic bile , on the gut -bile -host axis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603616>Gut  metabolic potential correlates with body size between mulberry-feeding lepidopteran pest species.</a></h2><p>Many insect pests rely on microbial symbionts to obtain nutrients or for defence, thereby allowing them to exploit novel food sources and degrade environmental xenobiotics including pesticides. Although Lepidoptera is one of the most diverse insect taxa and includes important agricultural pests, their microbiotas have not been studied much, particularly functional traits. Here, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the gut  across multiple mulberry-feeding lepidopteran species, resolving both community structure and metabolic potential.Our results indicate abundant bacteria inside the gut of larval Lepidoptera. However, even though they were fed the same diet, the structures of the bacterial communities differed in four major mulberry pest species, suggesting host-specific effects on microbial associations. Community-level metabolic reconstructions further showed that despite taxonomic composition varied greatly, carbohydrate and amino  metabolism and membrane transporter were key functional capabilities of gut bacteria in all samples, which may play basic roles in the larval gut. In addition, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of gut bacterial predicted gene ontologies revealed specialized features of the microbiotas associated with these mulberry pests, which were divided into two distinct clusters (macrolepidopterans vs. microlepidopterans). This pattern became even more prominent when more Lepidoptera species involved.A suite of gut  metabolic functions significantly correlated with larval size; the metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides, xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism were specifically enriched in large species, while small larvae had enhanced nucleotide metabolism.

Silybin (Sil), a naturally occurring hepatoprotective agent, was widely used for treating NAFLD. Whether Sil effects gut  during its actions in treating NAFLD, which is unknown. We aimed to examine the effect of Sil on intestinal flora dysbiosis induced by high-fat diet (HFD).After 10 weeks of feeding normal chow diet (NCD) or HFD, mice were given daily by gavage for 8 weeks. Cecal contents were harvested for study of short chain fatty  (SCFAs), bile  and gut  alteration.Sil showed protective effects against dietary-induced obesity and liver steatosis, accordingly gut  composition changed. At phylum level, compared with HFD group, mice in the Sil-treated group had significant lower level of Firmicutes and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (P<0.05). At genus level, Sil-treated group have significant lower level of Lachnoclostridium, Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006 and Mollicutes_RF9, which were reported to be potentially related to diet-induced obesity, and increased levels of Blautia (P<0.05), Akkermansia (P<0.05), Bacteroides(P<0.05) which were known to have beneficial effect on improving NAFLD. Sil also showed inhibitory effect on well-known beneficial bacteria, such as Alloprevotella, Lactobacillus. Moreover, production of acetate, propionate and butyrate increased, while generation of formate and conversion of cytotoxic secondary metabolites (LCA, DCA) decreased in mice treated with Sil.Sil might have beneficial effects on ameliorating NAFLD and mediate HFD-induced change of gut  composition, followed with major changes in secondary metabolites, such as SCFAs and BAs.This article is protected by copyright.

We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus. The combination also inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group and Tyzzerella. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the obesity-associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of deoxycholic , cholic , 1H-indole-3-acetic , 3-indole acrylic  and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. 2-Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic , l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome. In a high sugar diet mode, theabrownin reduced the body weight and triglycerides and improved insulin resistance mainly by targeting the reproduction of intestinal microorganisms such as BA, Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, Gut_metagenome and so on. A strong correlation between cecal microorganisms and serum metabolites, obesity and insulin resistance was observed.

Enterococcal infections, mainly caused by Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, include apical periodontitis, endocarditis, and bloodstream infections. Recently, vancomycinresistant Enterococci are considered major pathogens that are common but difficult to treat, especially in nosocomial settings. Moreover, E. faecalis is closely associated with recurrent endodontic infections and failed endodontic treatment. In this study, we investigated the effects of short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which are metabolites fermented by gut , on the growth of Enterococci. Enterococci were cultured in the presence or absence of acetate, propionate, or butyrate, and the optical density at 600 nm was measured to determine bacterial growth. The minimum inhibitory concentration/minimum bactericidal concentration test was conducted. Bacteria were treated with a SCFA, together with clinically used endodontic treatment methods such as triple antibiotics (metronidazole, minocycline, and ciprofloxacin) and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) to determine the effects of combination treatment. Of the SCFAs, propionate had a bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of E. faecalis in a dose-dependent manner and also that of clinical strains of E. faecalis isolated from dental plaques. Meanwhile, acetate and butyrate had minimal effects on E. faecalis growth. Moreover, propionate inhibited the growth of other Enterococci including E. faecium. In addition, combination treatment of propionate and triple antibiotics led to further growth inhibition, whereas no cooperative effect was observed at propionate plus CHX. These results indicate that propionate attenuates the growth of Enterococci, suggesting propionate as a potential agent to control Enterococcal infections, especially when combined with triple antibiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565850>Taraxacum officinale extract ameliorates dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis by regulating fatty  degradation and microbial dysbiosis.</a></h2><p>Numerous data show that taraxacum officinale extract (TOE) exerts protective effects on inflammatory diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms by which TOE affects dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis remain unclear. After DSS-induced colitis were treated with different concentrations of TOE for 8 days, the bodyweight, disease activity index (DAI), colon lengths and pathological scoring were assessed, and histopathological examination was confirmed by HE staining. Furthermore, a transcriptome sequencing was performed by using the colon tissues between TOE and DSS groups, and the differentially expressed genes were conducted for the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and were validated by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis. In addition, a 16S rDNA sequencing was carried out to distinguish the differential gut  by using the mouse faecal samples between TOE and DSS groups. We found that TOE attenuated the clinical symptoms, lowered the inflammatory scoring and inhibited the secretion of proinflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in DSS-induced colitis. KEGG and GSEA analysis demonstrated that fatty  degradation and cytokine-receptor signalling were predominantly enriched in TOE-treated colitis as compared with the DSS group. Further investigations revealed that TOE increased the expression levels of Adh5, Aldh3a2 and Acox3, but decreased those of CCL20, CCR6 and CXCL1/5 in DSS-induced colitis, where TOE also induced the enrichment of S24-7 and adlercreutzia, but decreased the amount of anaerostipes, enterococcus, enterobacteriaceae and peptostreptococcaceae. In conclusion, TOE ameliorated DSS-induced colitis by regulating fatty  degradation and microbial dysbiosis.© 2019 The Authors.

Intestinal transporters have been shown to play a significant role in the rate and extent of drug absorption of some, but not all, drug molecules. Due to the heterogeneous expression of multiple transporters along the intestine, the preferential absorption sites for drugs may vary significantly. In this chapter, we aim to summarize the current research on the expression, localization, function, and regulation of human intestinal transporters implicated in altering the absorption of low to medium molecular weight drug molecules. The role played by bile  transport proteins (e.g., ASBT and OST-α/β) is included in the discussion. The synergistic action of intestinal drug metabolism and transport is also discussed. Despite the complicated regulatory factors, the biopharmaceutics drug disposition classification system (BDDCS) put forward by Wu and Benet may help us better predict the effect of transporters on drug absorption. The drug-induced toxicity in the intestine, which may result from drug-drug interaction, gut , and bile salt toxicity, is also discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602443>Altered short chain fatty  profiles induced by dietary fiber intervention regulate AMPK levels and intestinal homeostasis.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary intervention on intestinal -mediated change in short chain fatty  (SCFA) profile and intestinal homeostasis. Sequencing of the 16S rDNA of gut bacteria, metagenomics, intestinal epithelial transcriptomics, and metabonomics were conducted. Results showed that the dietary interventions altered the  composition of cecal digesta, -mediated metabolism, and the gene expression profile in intestinal epithelial cells. Compared with red meat-diet-fed mice, fiber-diet-fed mice presented a shift in the gut microbiome toward increased production of butanoate, which was accompanied by up-regulation of - and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent gene expression and decrease in serum concentrations of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), triglyceride (TG) and glucose (GLU). The results suggested a new regulatory mechanism via which butanoate and AMPK activation contributed to intestinal integrity and homeostasis by affecting metabolism, intestinal barrier function and transporter expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614751>Metagenomic Insights into the Effects of Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) on the Composition of Luminal and Mucosal  in C57BL/6J Mice, Especially the  Composition.</a></h2><p>Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) are considered prebiotics and have been proven to selectively promote the growth of  in the gut.

After FOS intervention, there were significant increases in the total and wall weights of the cecum and the amount of total short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) in the cecal contents of the mice. At the phylum level, the results showed a significant increase in the relative abundance of Actinobacteria in the contents and mucosa from the cecum to the distal colon in the FOS group. Besides , a significant increase was observed in the relative abundance of  in all samples at the genus level, which may be partially related to the increase in butyric  levels in the luminal contents. Furthermore,  sequencing revealed that  was almost the sole bifidobacterial species in the luminal contents (>98%) and mucosa (>89%). These results indicated that FOS can selectively promote  proliferation in the intestine, either in the lumen or the mucosa from the cecum to the distal colon.

We sequenced the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region of gut  and detected metabolites based on liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in faecal samples.The composition of both the gut  and faecal metabolites changed significantly with T2D patients. The abundance of Proteobacteria and the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes were higher in T2D patients than healthy subjects, and the short chain fatty  (SCFAs), bile  and lipids of T2D patients were significantly disordered. Moreover, the abundances of certain SCFA-producing bacteria (Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae etc.) were significantly increased in T2D patients, while the faecal SCFAs concentrations were significantly decreased. It's suggested that the role of SCFA-producing bacteria was not simply to produce SCFAs. Then we identified 44 microbial modules to explore the correlations between the gut  and metabolic traits.

After 24-h treatment, pigs were monitored to assess feed intake (FI), and samples of serum and feces were collected to investigate serum profile, microbial composition, and short chain fatty  (SCFAs). The results showed that HS decreased (P < 0.05) FI compared with the TN group. Compared with TN group, HS changed serum profile by affecting biochemical parameters and hormones related with energy metabolism and stress response; immune indicators were also altered in HS group. Most of changes in serum profile were independent of FI reduction. Additionally, HS shifted the diversity and composition of fecal microbial community by increasing (P < 0.05) Proteobacteria and decreasing (P < 0.05) Bacteroidetes. Moreover, HS decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of propionate, butyrate, valerate, iso-valerate, and total SCFAs in feces with a FI-independent manner. Furthermore, the Spearman correlation analysis implied that changes of serum profile have potential correlation with alterations of fecal  and their metabolites SCFAs in acute HS-treated grow-finishing pigs.Metabolism disorders caused by 24-h acute HS associated with changes of fecal  and their metabolites SCFAs with a FI-independent manner in grow-finishing pigs.These results give us a new insight of the intestinal damage caused by acute HS and the underlying mechanisms.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629514>Analyses of physicochemical properties, bacterial , and lactic  bacteria of fresh camel milk collected in Inner Mongolia.</a></h2><p>Camel milk has significant economic value and is an important food in the region of Alxa Left Banner of Inner Mongolia.

However, the inoculation of  showed significant negative effects on the shoot, root, and total biomass of licorice plants. In addition, the effects of DSE inoculation on the morphological, photosynthetic, and antioxidant parameters of licorice plants, and mineral nutrient and microbial community composition in the rhizosphere soil were dependent on the DSE species as well as water regime. Interestingly, DSE inoculation significantly increased AM fungi content under drought stress. In addition, DSE associated with water had a significant positive influence on soil organic matter, available phosphorus (P), AM fungi, leaf number, soluble protein, SOD activity, total root length, root branch, and glycyrrhizic  content.

The present study investigated whether  TCP016 reduces the degree of liver damage by modifying the gut  via its exopolysaccharides (EPSs). First, it was illustrated that the main EPS (EPS016; molecular weight = 8.509 × 10 Da) comprised rhamnose, xylose, glucosamine, glucuronic , galactose, galacturonic , glucose, and mannose in molar ratios of 9.2:3.9:3.8:2.8:2.1:2.0:1.6:1.0. Our data showed that EPS016 alleviated the increase in plasma and hepatic enzyme and cytokine levels, increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione activity, and alleviated bacterial translocation to the liver and mesenteric lymph nodes in vivo. Furthermore, EPS016 ameliorated intestinal mucosal injury and gut flora dysbiosis, thereby decreasing the enrichment of , , and  and increasing the abundance of , , , _S24-7_group, and .

The objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of increasing dietary inclusion levels of laminarin in the first 14 days post-weaning on pig growth performance and weaning associated intestinal dysfunction. At weaning, 96 pigs (8.4 (SD 1.09) kg) (meatline boars x (large white x landrace sows) were blocked by live weight, litter and sex and randomly assigned to: 1) basal diet; 2) basal + 100ppm laminarin; 3) basal + 200ppm laminarin; 4) basal + 300ppm laminarin (3 pigs/pen). The appropriate quantity of a laminarin rich extract (65% laminarin) was added to the basal diet to achieve the above dietary inclusion levels of laminarin. After 14 days of supplementation, 8 pigs from the basal group and the best performing laminarin group were euthanised for sample collection. The 300ppm laminarin group was selected as this group had higher ADFI compared to all other groups and higher ADG than the basal group (P<0.05). Laminarin supplementation increased villus height in the duodenum and jejunum (P<0.05). Laminarin supplementation increased the expression of SLC2A8/GLUT8 in the duodenum, SLC2A2/GLUT2, SLC2A7/GLUT7, SLC15A1/PEPT1 and FABP2 in the jejunum, and SLC16A1/MCT1 in the colon. Laminarin supplementation reduced Enterobacteriaceae numbers in the caecum (P<0.05), and increased lactobacilli numbers (P<0.05), total volatile fatty  concentrations and the molar proportions of butyrate (P<0.01) in the colon. In conclusion, 300ppm laminarin from a laminarin rich extract has potential, as a dietary supplement, to improve performance and prevent post-weaning intestinal dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638593>Targeting the Infant Gut  Through a Perinatal Educational Dietary Intervention: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>The early life gut  are an important regulator of the biological pathways contributing toward the pathogenesis of noncommunicable disease. It is unclear whether improvements to perinatal diet quality could alter the infant gut .The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a perinatal educational dietary intervention in influencing gut  in mothers and infants 4 weeks after birth.The Healthy Parents, Healthy Kids randomized controlled trial aimed to recruit 90 pregnant women from Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. At week 26 of gestation, women were randomized to receive dietary advice from their doctor (n=45), or additionally receive a dietary intervention (n=45). The intervention included an educational workshop and 2 support calls aiming to align participants' diets with the Australian Dietary Guidelines and increase intakes of prebiotic and probiotic foods. The educational design focused on active learning and self-assessment. Behavior change techniques were used to support dietary adherence, and the target behavior was eating for the gut . Exclusion criteria were age under 18 years, diagnosed mental illnesses, obesity, diabetes mellitus, diagnosed bowel conditions, exclusion diets, illicit drug use, antibiotic use, prebiotic or probiotic supplementation, and those lacking dietary autonomy. The primary outcome measure is a between-group difference in alpha diversity in infant stool collected 4 weeks after birth. Secondary outcomes include evaluating the efficacy of the intervention in influencing infant and maternal stool microbial composition and short chain fatty  concentrations, epigenetic profile, and markers of inflammation and stress, as well as changes in maternal dietary intake and well-being. The study and intervention feasibility and acceptance will also be evaluated as secondary outcomes.The study results are yet to be written. The first participant was enrolled on July 28, 2016, and the final follow-up assessment was completed on October 11, 2017.Data from this study will provide new insights regarding the ability of interventions targeting the perinatal diet to alter the maternal and infant gut .

To investigate the effects of aging on the gut  independent of nutrient effects, we analyzed the gut microbiomes of 126 micro-pigs at a wide range of ages from newborns to 10 years old. The micro-pigs were reared in a constantly controlled environment. The diversity of the gut microbiome was found to continuously change with age. We also found associations between age and specific members and functions of the gut microbiome. Consistent with previous studies on the human gut microbiome, beneficial microbes including probiotic bacteria and short-chain fatty -producers decreased in older pigs, whereas Bacteroides increased with age. Based on the correlation network, Bacteroides seemed to have an important role in determining the relative abundances of other beneficial microbes. Our results suggest that maintaining beneficial gut microbes at a specific ratio corresponding to a certain age might contribute to a younger gut microbiome-age. Furthermore, due to similarities with the human system, micro-pigs are a useful animal model to elucidate the links between aging and the microbiome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671768>Quantification of Urinary Phenyl-γ-Valerolactones and Related Valeric  in Human Urine on Consumption of Apples.</a></h2><p>Flavan-3-ols are dietary bioactive molecules that have beneficial effects on human health and reduce the risk of various diseases. Monomeric flavan-3-ols are rapidly absorbed in the small intestine and released in the blood stream as phase II conjugates. Polymeric flavan-3-ols are extensively metabolized by colonic gut  into phenyl-γ-valerolactones and their related phenylvaleric . These molecules are the main circulating metabolites in humans after the ingestion of flavan-3-ol rich-products; nevertheless, they have received less attention and their role is not understood yet. Here, we describe the quantification of 8 phenyl-γ-valerolactones and 3 phenylvaleric  in the urine of 11 subjects on consumption of apples by using UHPLC-ESI-Triple Quad-MS with pure reference compounds. Phenyl-γ-valerolactones, mainly as sulfate and glucuronic  conjugates, reached maximum excretion between 6 and 12 after apple consumption, with a decline thereafter. Significant differences were detected in the cumulative excretion rates within subjects and in the ratio of dihydroxyphenyl-γ-valerolactone sulfate to glucuronide conjugates.

Once stimulated, these cells activate specialized structures such as Toll-like receptor and Nod-like receptor (NLR). By detecting danger-associated molecules, these receptors can set in motion major innate immunity pathways such as nuclear factor ĸB (NF-ĸB) and NLRP3 inflammasome, causing metabolic reprogramming and phenotype changes of immune and parenchymal cells and triggering the secretion of a number of inflammatory mediators that can cause irreversible tissue damage and functional loss. Growing evidence suggests that this response can be deeply impacted by the crosstalk between the kidneys and other organs, such as the gut. Changes in the composition and/or metabolite production of the gut  can influence inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, thus offering opportunities to positively manipulate the composition and/or functionality of gut  and, consequentially, ameliorate deleterious consequences of renal diseases. In this review, we summarize the most recent evidence that renal inflammation can be ameliorated by interfering with the gut  through the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics. In addition to these innovative approaches, we address the recent discovery of new targets for drugs long in use in clinical practice. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, NF-ĸB inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and antimetabolic drugs can reduce renal macrophage infiltration and slow down the progression of renal disease by mechanisms independent of those usually attributed to these compounds. Allopurinol, an inhibitor of uric  production, has been shown to decrease renal inflammation by limiting activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. So far, these protective effects have been shown in experimental studies only. Clinical studies will establish whether these novel strategies can be incorporated into the arsenal of treatments intended to prevent the progression of human disease.Copyright © 2019 Andrade-Oliveira, Foresto-Neto, Watanabe, Zatz and Câmara.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635738>Chain conformation, physicochemical properties of fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from sea cucumber Stichopus chloronotus and its in vitro fermentation by human gut .</a></h2><p>This study investigated the chain conformation, physicochemical properties of fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from Stichopus chloronotus (fCS-Sc) using HPSEC-MALLS and worm-like cylinder model methods and its impact on human gut  by 16s RNA gene sequencing.

However, chronic treatment with GCs in clinical settings has a series of side effects, such as metabolic disorders, gut  dysbiosis and neurological impairment. Therefore, searching for a functional substance that can alleviate these side effects is greatly meaningful to clinical patients. Crocin is the main active ingredient of saffron, which has been reported to have numerous pharmacological activities. However, the action of crocin-I, one major member of the crocin family, on the physiological mediation in the individuals receiving GC treatment remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of crocin-I on lipid metabolism and the gut  in a mouse model of chronic corticosterone (CORT) treatment. Our findings showed that crocin-I reduced the levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol and the ratio of low density lipoprotein to high density lipoprotein in the serum of CORT-treated mice. In addition, transcriptome analysis revealed that crocin-I was effective in mediating the amelioration of lipid metabolism, mainly in fatty  metabolism and steroid biosynthesis in CORT-treated mice. Moreover, metabolome analysis demonstrated that crocin-I could restore the disturbed metabolites in the liver of CORT-treated mice, most of which are long-chain fatty . Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing of 16s rRNA revealed that crocin-I could mitigate the dysbiosis of the gut  caused by CORT at a dose of 40 mg kg-1, by resulting in a significant increase in the alpha diversity of the microbes in the cecal contents and a significant reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes, whereas by increasing the abundance of Bacteroidetes. These results indicated that oral administration of crocin-I could modify the composition of the gut  and alleviate hepatic lipid disorder in mice treated with a high dose of GCs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594827>Distinct Gut  Induced by Different Fat-to-Sugar-Ratio High-Energy Diets Share Similar Pro-obesity Genetic and Metabolite Profiles in Prediabetic Mice.</a></h2><p>Gut  play important roles in host metabolism, especially in diabetes. However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different  is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different fat-to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the  and early-stage metabolic syndrome. The two diets resulted in different  but similar diabetic states. Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic , cholestan-3-ol (5β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with lipogenesis and inflammation. Our study suggests that different metabolic-syndrome-inducing diets may result in different  but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Various types of diet can lead to type 2 diabetes. The gut  in type 2 diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut  induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease. Here we found that high-energy diets with two different fat-to-sugar ratios can both cause obesity and prediabetes but enrich different gut . Still, these different gut  have similar genetic and metabolite compositions. The microbial metabolites in common between the diets modulate lipid accumulation and macrophage inflammation  and  This work suggests that studies that only use 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine how the microbes respond to diet and associate with diabetic state are missing vital information.Copyright © 2019 Shan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661802>Systematic Culturomics Shows that Half of Chicken Caecal  Members can be Grown in Vitro Except for Two Lineages of  and a Single Lineage of .</a></h2><p>Epidemiological data show that the composition of gut  influences host health, disease status, and even behaviour.

All therapies were administered twice daily for four consecutive days including before and after bacterial challenge; except ampicillin which was administered only before and after bacterial challenge on day 0. Fecal samples were collected at Days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10. Samples were homogenized and plated on LB plates supplemented with NalAc to determine viable Ec231 counts. Body weights were measured at every fecal sample collection point. qPCR was performed using specific  O157:H7 primers to quantify the number of  O157:H7 genome copies.  community profiles were analyzed using Denature Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and 16S rRNA sequencing. F.O.P. significantly ( < 0.05) reduced  O157:H7 pathogen counts by 54%. Ampicillin therapy significantly ( < 0.05) reduced  O157:H7 pathogen counts by 79%. Greater initial weight-loss occurred in mice treated with ampicillin (-5.44%) compared to other treatment groups. No notable changes in the gut  profiles were observed for control and F.O.P. groups. In contrast, the antibiotic group displayed noticeable distortion of the gut  composition, only partially returning to normal by Day 10. In conclusion, we found that F.O.P. administration was effective in reducing viable  O157:H7 in infected mice with a similar efficacy to ampicillin therapy.

Consequently, the establishment of multiple wastewater treatment strategies remains as a fundamental challenge in AMD research. Bioremediation, as a constantly-evolving multidisciplinary endeavor had been complemented during the last decades by novel tools of increasingly higher resolution such as those based on omics approaches, which are providing detailed insights into the ecology, evolution and mechanisms of microbial communities acting in bioremediation processes. This review specifically addresses, reanalyzes and reexamines in a composite comparative manner, the available sequence information and associated metadata available in public databases about AMD impacted microbial communities; summarizing our understanding of its composition and functions, and proposing potential genetic enhancements for improved bioremediation strategies. 16 S rRNA gene-targeted sequencing data from 9 studies previously published including AMD systems reported and studied around the world, were collected and reanalyzed to compare and identify the core and most abundant genera in four distinct AMD ecosystems: surface biofilm, water, impacted soils/sediments and bioreactor microbiomes.

A principal focus of this research seeks to further understand the production of metabolic by-products produced by bacteria resident in the gut, and the subsequent interaction of these metabolites on host physiology and pathophysiology of disease. Gut bacterial metabolites of interest are predominately formed via metabolic breakdown of dietary compounds including choline and ʟ-carnitine (trimethylamine N-oxide), amino  (phenol- and indole-containing uremic toxins) and non-digestible dietary fibers (short-chain fatty ).

This reciprocal interaction is established through the vascular route of the portal vein that carries gut-derived products directly to the liver, and the liver feed-back route of bile and antibody secretion to the intestine. The intestinal mucosal and vascular barrier is the functional and anatomical structure that serves as a playground for the interactions between the gut and the liver, limiting the systemic dissemination of microbes and toxins while allowing nutrients to access the circulation and to reach the liver. The control of microbial communities is critical to maintain homeostasis of the gut-liver axis, and as part of the two-way communication the liver shapes intestinal microbial communities. Alcohol disrupts the gut-liver axis at multiple interconnected levels, including the gut microbiome, mucus, epithelial barrier and antimicrobial peptides production, which increases the microbial exposure and the pro-inflammatory environment of the liver. Growing evidences indicate the pathogenetic role of microbe-derived metabolites, such as trimethylamine, secondary bile , SCFA and ethanol, in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Cirrhosis by itself is associated to profound alterations in gut  and damage at the different levels of defense of the intestinal barrier, including the epithelial, the vascular and the immune barriers. The relevance of the severe disturbance of the intestinal barrier in cirrhosis has been linked to translocation of live bacteria, bacterial infections and disease progression. The identification of the elements of the gut-liver axis primarily damaged in each chronic liver disease offers possibilities to intervention. Beyond antibiotics, upcoming therapies centered in the gut include new generations of probiotics, bacterial metabolites (postbiotics), fecal microbial transplantation, and carbon nanoparticles. FXR-agonists target both the gut and the liver and are currently being tested in different liver diseases. Finally, synthetic biotic medicines, phages that target specific bacteria or therapies that create physical barriers between the gut and the liver offer new approaches of treatment.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Several interventions are available for the management of patients with IBS, but no universal management algorithm currently exists. The aim of this article is to review interventions that may be considered in the management of patients with IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D). Nonpharmacological interventions include dietary and lifestyle modification, which are generally used as first-line therapy. Probiotics have demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with IBS, but studies are inconsistent in strains examined, dosing, and treatment duration. Psychological therapies (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnotherapy) also may improve IBS symptoms. Pharmacological interventions for the management of IBS-D include the US Food and Drug Administration-approved agents eluxadoline, rifaximin, and alosetron, as well as loperamide, smooth muscle antispasmodics, bile  sequestrants, and antidepressants (i.e. tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Eluxadoline and rifaximin have been shown to improve abdominal pain and stool consistency in patients with IBS-D. In addition, data indicate that alosetron improves IBS symptoms; however, it is approved only for women with severe IBS-D. Of the three approved agents, rifaximin has the most favorable safety profile. The risk-benefit ratio is an important consideration with every medication, but is especially important in the treatment of functional GI disorders such as IBS-D.

At the same time, diet has a proven impact on maintaining intestinal microbial homeostasis. Given this association, we performed a feasibility study in RA patients using high-fiber dietary supplementation with the objective to restore microbial homeostasis and promote the secretion of beneficial immunomodulatory microbial metabolites. RA patients ( = 36) under routine care received daily high-fiber bars or cereals for 28 days. Clinical assessments and laboratory analysis of immune parameters in blood and stool samples from RA patients were done before and after the high-fiber dietary supplementation. We observed an increase in circulating regulatory T cell numbers, favorable Th1/Th17 ratios, as well as decreased markers of bone erosion in RA patients after 28 days of dietary intervention.

Twenty-one pigs (initial BW 19.90 ± 1.00 kg, 63 ± 1 days of age) were assigned to three groups and fed with control diet (16% CP), LP diets (13% CP) supplemented with free AAs (LPA) or casein hydrolysate (LPC) for 4 weeks.Compared with control diet, LPA and LPC diet decreased the relative abundance of  and , and LPC diet further decreased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria. LPC diet also increased the relative abundance of . Both LP diets decreased concentrations of ammonia and cadaverine, and LPC diet also reduced concentrations of putrescine, phenol and indole. Moreover, LPC diet increased total short-chain fatty  concentration. In comparison with control diet, both LP diets decreased protein expressions of Toll-like receptor-4, nuclear factor-κB, interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, and LPC diet further decreased protein expressions of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein-1 and interferon-γ. LPC diet also increased protein expressions of G-protein coupled receptor-43, interleukin-4, transforming growth factor-β, immunoglobulin A and mucin-4, which are indicators for mucosal defense activity.The results showed that supplementing casein hydrolysate showed beneficial effects on the colonic  and mucosal immunity and barrier function in comparison with supplementing free AAs in LP diets. These findings may provide new framework for future nutritional interventions for colon health in pigs.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555273>Short-Chain Fatty  Regulate the Immune Responses via G Protein-Coupled Receptor 41 in Bovine Rumen Epithelial Cells.</a></h2><p>The rumen immune system often suffers when challenging antigens from lysis of dead  cells in the rumen. However, the rumen epithelium innate immune system can actively respond to the infection. Previous studies have demonstrated G protein-coupled receptors 41 (GPR41) as receptors for short chain fatty  (SCFAs) in human. We hypothesized that SCFAs, the most abundant microbial metabolites in rumen, may regulate the immune responses by GPR41 in bovine rumen epithelial cells (BRECs). Therefore, the objective of study was to firstly establish an immortal BRECs line and investigate the regulatory effects of SCFAs and GPR41 on innate immunity responses in BRECs. These results showed that long-term BRECs cultures were established by SV40T-induced immortalization. The concentrations of 20 mM SCFAs significantly enhanced the levels of GPR41, IL1β, TNFα, chemokines, and immune barrier genes by transcriptome analysis. Consistent with transcriptome results, the expression of GPR41, IL1β, TNFα, and chemokines were markedly upregulated in BRECs treated with 20 mM SCFAs by qRT-PCR compared with control BRECs. Remarkably, the GPR41 knockdown (GPR41KD) BRECs treated with 20 mM SCFAs significantly enhanced the proinflammatory cytokines IL1β and TNFα expression compared with wild type BRECs treated with 20 mM SCFAs, but reduced the expression of CCL20, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL8, CXCL14, Occludin, and ZO-1. Moreover, GPR41 mRNA expression is positively correlated with CCL20, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCL14, and ZO-1. These findings revealed that SCFAs regulate GPR41-mediated levels of genes involved in immune cell recruitment and epithelial immune barrier and thereby mediate protective innate immunity in BRECs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586017>Decreased ω6/ω3 PUFA ratio attenuates ethanol-induced alterations in intestinal homeostasis,  and liver injury.</a></h2><p>Ethanol-induced alterations in intestinal homeostasis lead to multi-system pathologies, including liver injury.  w6-PUFAs exert pro-inflammatory activity, while ω3-PUFAs promote anti-inflammatory activity that is mediated, in part, through specialized pro-resolving mediators (e.g. RvD1).  We tested the hypothesis that a decrease in ω6/ω3 PUFA ratio would attenuate ethanol-mediated alterations in the gut-liver axis.  fat-1 mice, which endogenously increase w3-PUFA levels, were protected against ethanol-mediated down-regulation of intestinal tight junction proteins in organoid cultures and in vivo.  Ethanol and LPS-induced expression of INF-g, Il-6, and Cxcl1 was attenuated in fat-1 and WT RvD1-treated mice. RNA-seq of ileum tissue revealed up-regulation of several genes involved in cell proliferation and stem cell renewal, and anti-microbial defense (including Alpi and Leap2) in fat-1 vs WT mice fed ethanol.  fat-1 mice were also resistant to ethanol-mediated down-regulation of genes important for xenobiotic/bile  detoxification.  Further, gut microbiome and plasma metabolomics revealed several changes in fat-1 vs. WT mice that may contribute to a reduced inflammatory response.  Finally, these data correlated with a significant reduction in liver injury.  Our study suggests that w3-PUFA enrichment or treatment with resolvins can attenuate the disruption in alcohol-induced intestinal homeostasis caused by ethanol consumption and systemic inflammation with a concomitant reduction in liver injury.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654895>Protective properties of milk sphingomyelin against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation.</a></h2><p>The identification of natural bioactive compounds aimed at promoting optimal gut health and improving lipid metabolism is paramount in the prevention of chronic disease. In this review, we summarize basic science and clinical research examining the protective properties of milk sphingomyelin (SM) against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. Dietary SM dose-dependently reduces the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, triglycerides, and fatty  in cell culture and rodent studies. Overall, rodent feeding studies show dietary milk SM, milk polar lipid mixtures, and milk fat globule membrane reduce serum and hepatic lipid concentrations. Furthermore, these hypolipidemic effects are observed in some supplementation studies in humans, although the extent of reductions in serum cholesterol is typically smaller and only one trial was conducted with purified SM. Dietary milk SM has been reported to affect the gut  in rodent studies and its hydrolytic product, sphingosine, displays bactericidal activity in vitro. Milk SM may also improve gut barrier function to prevent the translocation of inflammatory gut bacteria-derived molecules. Current evidence from pre-clinical studies indicates that dietary milk SM has protective properties against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. The hypolipidemic effects of milk SM observed in animal studies have been reported in some human studies, although the magnitude of such effects is typically smaller. More research is warranted to clearly define how dietary milk SM influences lipid metabolism, gut , and inflammation in humans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We selected studies that provided data on SCFA levels or fecal  abundance in obese and nonobese individuals and then combined the published estimates using a random-effects meta-analysis. Obese individuals had significantly higher fecal concentrations of acetate (SMD (standardized mean differences) = 0.87, 95% CI (confidence interva) = 0.24-1.50,  (-squared) = 88.5), propionate (SMD = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.35-1.36,  = 82.3%), and butyrate (SMD = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.29-1.27,  = 81.7%) than nonobese controls. The subgroup analyses showed no evidence of heterogeneity among obese individuals with a BMI >30 kg/m ( = 0.0%). At the phylum level, the abundance of fecal  was reduced in obese compared to nonobese individuals, but the difference was not statistically significant (Bacteroidetes phylum, SMD = -0.36, 95% CI = -0.73-0.01; Firmicutes phylum, SMD = -0.10, 95% CI = -0.31-0.10). The currently available human case-control studies show that obesity is associated with high levels of SCFA but not gut  richness at the phylum level. Additional well-designed studies with a considerable sample size are needed to clarify whether this association is causal, but it is also necessary to identify additional contributors to SCFA production, absorption, and excretion in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645150>Degree of lipid saturation affects depressive-like behaviour and gut  in mice.</a></h2><p>This study explored the effects of the degree of lipid saturation on depressive behaviour and gut  in mice. Thirty-two mice were divided into normal (N), Prozac (NP), lard (L) and fish oil (F) groups. After a 12-week dietary intervention, the open field test (OFT) and the forced swim test (FST) were conducted before sacrifice. The mice in the L group exhibited anxiety-like behaviours in the OFT and depressive-like behaviours in the FST. A significant difference was observed in β-diversity indices between the L group and the F group. The abundance of  and  was significantly higher in the F group than in the L and N groups. The prefrontal cortex fatty  composition was altered in various lipid-treated groups and was highly correlated with depressive-like behaviours. In conclusion, the degree of lipid saturation affects depressive-like behaviour, gut  composition, and the prefrontal cortex fatty  profile in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636419>Elucidation of a sialic  metabolism pathway in mucus-foraging Ruminococcus gnavus unravels mechanisms of bacterial adaptation to the gut.</a></h2><p>Sialic  (N-acetylneuraminic  (Neu5Ac)) is commonly found in the terminal location of colonic mucin glycans where it is a much-coveted nutrient for gut bacteria, including Ruminococcus gnavus. R. gnavus is part of the healthy gut  in humans, but it is disproportionately represented in diseases. There is therefore a need to understand the molecular mechanisms that underpin the adaptation of R. gnavus to the gut. Previous in vitro research has demonstrated that the mucin-glycan-foraging strategy of R. gnavus is strain dependent and is associated with the expression of an intramolecular trans-sialidase, which releases 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac, rather than Neu5Ac, from mucins. Here, we unravelled the metabolism pathway of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac in R. gnavus that is underpinned by the exquisite specificity of the sialic transporter for 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac and by the action of an oxidoreductase that converts 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac into Neu5Ac, which then becomes a substrate of a Neu5Ac-specific aldolase. Having generated an R. gnavus nan-cluster deletion mutant that lost the ability to grow on sialylated substrates, we showed that-in gnotobiotic mice colonized with R. gnavus wild-type (WT) and mutant strains-the fitness of the nan mutant was significantly impaired, with a reduced ability to colonize the mucus layer. Overall, we revealed a unique sialic  pathway in bacteria that has important implications for the spatial adaptation of mucin-foraging gut symbionts in health and disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624009>Nutritional and dietary strategy in the clinical care of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease have been increasing for decades and IBD has become a worldwide disease. Epidemiology studies demonstrated higher incidence rates in the more westernized countries. The change of habitual diets in these countries is perceived as the reason for the development of IBD. Besides, molecular biological studies showed some pathogenic substances produced after digestion of daily diet decrease the diversity of intestinal  and cause dysbiosis of microbiome. Then, chronic inflammation occurs in some genetically susceptible subjects and IBD developed. As a result, many researchers started to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of nutrients and dietary intervention on the clinical course and pathogenesis of IBD. Carbohydrates, fats, proteins and fibers are investigated and their molecular roles in the inflammatory process are discovered gradually. The undigested carbohydrates are proved to cause overgrowth of colonic bacteria and inflammation occurs by altering colonic microbiome. ω-3 poly-unsaturated fatty  are more favored over ω-6 poly-unsaturated fatty  due to its less pro-inflammatory properties. High fibers produce more short-chain fatty  in colon and facilitate the diversity of colonic . Moreover, some dietary interventions were designed and studied with promising results. Low FODMAP is recommended in IBS and is also suggested in patients of IBD with IBS-like symptoms. Specific Carbohydrate Diet was designed for celiac disease at first and is proved to be effective to decrease inflammation and to induce remission by decreasing non-digested carbohydrates into colon. Exclusive Enteral Nutrition has been investigated and is suggested to be the first line of management in pediatric CD in many literatures. Paleolithic diet and semi-vegetarian diet are evaluated and might be beneficial in some clinical settings. These findings are promising but limited to the evidence without high quality level. Some more well-designed studies with randomization and double-blind are needed and the primary endpoints should be more focused on the decrease of inflammation in pathology and mucosal healing in endoscopy instead of relief of the symptoms.Copyright © 2019.

Particularly, root exudation is one of the most important plant-associated processes in this respect, as it may have a substantial effect on the bioavailability of soil contaminants, specially of hydrophobic contaminants strongly sorbed by soil. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of root exudates (natural and artificial) on the desorption of α-, β-, δ- and γ-isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) from contaminated soil, using batch experiments. Natural root exudates were obtained from Holcus lanatus plants growing in the same (contaminated) area. Fifteen compounds (mainly organic  and phenolic compounds) usually found in root exudates were also tested, individually or as mixtures (1 and 10 mM). Both natural and artificial exudates favoured the mobilization of sorbed HCH in soil. The effect was highly significant for α-, β- and γ-HCH isomers, for which the desorption rates increased by 23.0, 26.8 and 15.5% in the presence of natural root exudates and by 40.1, 25.9 and 25.6% in the presence of the artificial mixture (at 10 mM). The δ-HCH desorption rates increased by less than 10%. The effect of individual exudate components was very variable, but increased with the carbon content, reflecting the significance of hydrophobic interactions between the exudates and HCH molecules in the desorption of these last from soil. These findings indicate that plants may significantly influence the bioavailability of persistent contaminants, with major implications for improving phyto- and bioremediation procedures.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Two of the four rhinoceros species in human care, Sumatran rhinoceros () and black rhinoceros (), are susceptible, whereas the other two, white rhinoceros () and greater one-horned (GOH) rhinoceros (), are relatively resistant to IOD. Complex interrelationships exist between mammalian hosts, their indigenous gut , metabolome, physical condition, and iron availability. The goal of this study was to gain insight into these relationships within the family Rhinocerotidae. Specific objectives were to (1) characterize the gut microbiome and metabolome of four rhinoceros species; (2) compare the microbiome and metabolome of IOD-susceptible and IOD-resistant rhinoceros species; and (3) identify variation in the microbiome and metabolome associated with compromised health or disease in IOD-susceptible rhinoceroses. Fecal samples were collected from 31 rhinoceroses (Sumatran rhinoceros,  = 3; black rhinoceros,  = 6; GOH rhinoceros,  = 9; white rhinoceros,  = 13) located at five facilities, and matched fecal aliquots were processed for microbiome and metabolome analyses using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. Despite the phylogenetic disparity and dissimilar zoo diets of the hosts, the structure of the fecal  of the two IOD-susceptible rhinoceros species were more closely related to each other than to those of the two IOD-resistant species (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity; IOD-susceptible vs. IOD-resistant -value < 0.001). In addition, IOD-susceptible rhinoceroses exhibited less microbial diversity than their IOD-resistant relatives (Shannon diversity; -value < 0.001) which could have health implications. Of note, the black rhinoceros was distinct among the four rhinoceros species with the most divergent fecal metabolome; interestingly, it contained higher concentrations of short chain fatty . Neither age nor sex were associated with differences in microbial community composition ( = 0.253 and 0.488, respectively) or fecal metabolomic profile ( = 0.634 and 0.332, respectively). Differences in the distal gut microbiomes between IOD-resistant and IOD-susceptible rhinoceroses support hypotheses that gut microbes play a role in host iron acquisition, and further studies and experiments to test these hypotheses are warranted.Copyright © 2019 Roth, Switzer, Watanabe-Chailland, Bik, Relman, Romick-Rosendale and Ollberding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612141>Administration of  KBL375 Causes Taxonomic and Functional Changes in Gut  Leading to Improvement of Atopic Dermatitis.</a></h2><p>Gut  play an important role in immune responses and energy metabolism.

Significant reductions in mast cells and eosinophils were discovered in skin tissues from  KBL375-treated mice. T helper 2 cell-related cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-31 significantly decreased, and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 or transforming growth factor-β increased in skin tissues from  KBL375-treated mice. In addition to phenotypic changes in skin tissues,  KBL375 treatment induced an increase in the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cell population in mesenteric lymph nodes.

Metabolic analysis of the cecum also showed significant changes in the levels of various amino  including methionine, phenylalanine, serine, and tyrosine, as well as short chain fatty  such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate in AD-induced mice due to  KBL375 treatment. These altered metabolites in AD-induced mice returned to the levels similar to those in control mice when treated with  KBL375.

The agents tested were: alpha-lactoalbumin (ALAC), a whey protein rich in tryptophan, effective in some animal models of epilepsy and on colon/intestine inflammation, valproic  (VPA), an effective antiepileptic drug in this seizure model, mesalazine (MSZ) an effective aminosalicylate anti-inflammatory treatment against ulcerative colitis and sodium butyrate (NaB), a short chain fatty  (SCFA) normally produced in the intestine by gut , important in maintaining gut health and reducing gut inflammation and oxidative stress. Intestinal inflammation was induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) administration for 6 days. Drug treatment was started on day 3 and lasted 11 days, when seizure susceptibility to PTZ was measured along with intestinal inflammatory markers (i.e. NF-κB, Iκ-Bα, COX-2, iNOS), histological damage, disease activity index (DAI) and SCFA concentration in stools. DSS-induced colitis increased seizure susceptibility and while all treatments were able to reduce intestinal inflammation, only ALAC and NaB exhibited significant antiepileptic properties in mice with induced colitis, while they were ineffective as antiepileptics at the same doses in control mice without colitis. Interestingly, in DSS-treated mice, VPA lost part of its antiepileptic efficacy in comparison to preventing seizures in non-DSS-treated mice while MSZ remained ineffective in both groups. Our study demonstrates that reducing intestinal inflammation through ALAC or NaB administration has specific anticonvulsant effects in PTZ-treated mice. Furthermore, it appears that intestinal inflammation may reduce the antiepileptic effects of VPA, although we confirm that it decreases seizure threshold in this group. Therefore, we suggest that intestinal inflammation may represent a valid antiepileptic target which should also be considered as a participating factor to seizure incidence in susceptible patients and also could be relevant in reducing standard antiepileptic drug efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620118>Dietary Fiber-Induced Microbial Short Chain Fatty  Suppress ILC2-Dependent Airway Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Group 2 Innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) contribute significantly to allergic inflammation.

We further show that SCFAs modulate GATA3, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolytic metabolic pathways in pulmonary ILC2s. The observed phenotype is associated with increased IL-17a secretion by lung ILC2s and linked to enhanced neutrophil recruitment to the airways. Finally, we show that butyrate-producing gut bacteria in germ-free mice effectively suppress ILC2-driven AHR.

Alteration of the intestinal barrier is associated with enhanced intestinal permeability and development of numerous pathological diseases including gastrointestinal and cardiometabolic diseases. Among the metabolites that play an important role within intestinal health, L Tryptophan (Trp) is one of the nine essential amino  supplied by diet, whose metabolism appears as a key modulator of gut , with major impacts on physiological, and pathological pathways. Recently, emerging evidence showed that the Trp catabolism through one major enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) expressed by the host affects Trp metabolism by gut  to generate indole metabolites, thereby altering gut function and health in mice and humans. In this mini review, I summarize the most recent advances concerning the role of Trp metabolism in host- cross-talk in health, and metabolic diseases.

What constitutes a unique feature of this model is its twofold objective of introducing an ileal microbial community and mimicking a dietary weaning transition. This model should then be ideally suited to test the dietary weaning strategies of piglets in vitro. Regarding the , the main phyla making up the model were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria although Bacteroidetes decreased after inoculation (p = 0.043 in ileum, p = 0.021 in colon) and Delta-Proteobacteria were favoured (p = 0.083 in ileum, p = 0.043 in colon) compared to Gamma-Proteobacteria. The designed model led to a low representation of Bacilli - especially Lactobacillus sp. in the ileum and a weak representation of Bacteroidia in the proximal colon. However, Mitsuokella and Prevotella were part of the major genera of the model along with Bifidobacterium, Fusobacterium, Megasphaera and Bacteroides. As a result of weaning, two major changes - normally occurring in vivo - were detected in the system: firstly, Firmicutes diminished when Bacteroidetes increased particularly in the proximal colon; secondly, Bacteroides decreased and Prevotella increased (mean value for four runs). In terms of metabolite production, while a ratio acetate: propionate: butyrate of 60:26:14 was obtained in post-weaned colon, the expected inversion of the ratio propionate: butyrate in the post-weaned ileum was unfortunately not observed. To conclude, the so-called baby-SPIME model meets expectations regarding the resident  of the proximal colon bioreactor and the metabolites produced thereof. In terms of the evolution of major groups of bacteria, the in vitro weaning process appeared to be successful. However, higher concentration of butyric  would have been expected in ileum part of newly weaned piglets, as observed in vivo. The  in the ileum bioreactor seemed in fact to act like a pre-colon.

To better understand the effects of oats on gastrointestinal health in humans, a literature review with predefined search criteria was conducted using the PubMed database and keywords for common gastrointestinal health outcomes. Moreover, to examine the gastrointestinal effects of oats across the scientific spectrum, a similar search strategy was executed to identify animal studies. In vitro studies were identified from the reference lists of human and animal studies. A total of 8 human studies, 19 animal studies, and 5 in vitro studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. The evidence in humans shows beneficial effects of oats on gastrointestinal health, with supportive evidence provided by in vitro and animal studies. The effective dose of oats varies by type, although an amount providing 2.5 to 2.9 g of β-glucan per day was shown to decrease fecal pH and alter fecal bacteria. For oat bran, 40 to 100 g/d was shown to increase fecal bacterial mass and short-chain fatty  in humans. Differences in study design, methodology, and type of oats tested make valid comparisons difficult. The identification of best practices for the design of oat studies should be a priority in future research, as the findings will be useful for determining how oats influence specific indices of gastrointestinal health, including the composition of the human gut microbiome.© The Author(s) 2019.

Some fungal species are commensal organisms that are part of the normal human , and, as such, do not pose a threat to the immune system. However, when the natural balance of this association is disturbed or the host's immune system is compromised, these fungal pathogens overtake the organism, and cause IFI. To understand the invasiveness of these pathogens and to address the growing problem of IFI, it is essential to identify the cellular processes of the invading organism and their virulence. In this review, we will discuss the prevalence and current options available to treat IFI, including recent reports of drug resistance. Nevertheless, the main focus of this review is to describe the glycobiology of human fungal pathogens and how various components of the fungal cell wall, particularly cell wall polysaccharides and glycoconjugates, are involved in fungal pathogenicity, their biosynthesis and how they can be potentially exploited to develop novel antifungal treatment options. We will specifically describe the nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) that are important in fungal survival and suggest that the inhibition of fungal NSTs may potentially be useful to prevent the establishment of fungal infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624005>Starch Digestion by Gut Bacteria: Crowdsourcing for Carbs.</a></h2><p>Starch is a polymer of glucose and is one of the most abundant carbohydrates in a Western diet. Resistant starch escapes digestion by host small intestinal glucoamylases and transits the colon where it is degraded by the combined efforts of many gut bacteria. Bacterial metabolism and fermentation of resistant starch leads to increases in short-chain fatty , including the clinically beneficial butyrate. Here, we review the molecular machinery that gut bacteria use to degrade starch and how these functions may intersect to facilitate complete starch digestion. While the protein complexes that gut bacteria use to degrade starch differ across phyla, some molecular details converge to promote the optimal positioning of enzymes and substrate for starch degradation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD). Probiotics may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative colitis patients, probiotics remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti-inflammatory capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic -induced murine model of colitis. The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of colitis that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of probiotics.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Commonly known as a kind of constituent macromolecules, non-digestible polysaccharides have always been fermented by the intestinal . Nostoc commune Vaucher (N. commune) has always been appreciated as a healthy food and supplementation worldwide as it is rich in nutrients. Particularly, polysaccharides account for 60% of the dry weight of N. commune. In this study, we examined the protective effects of the polysaccharides isolated from N. commune (NVPS) against colitis-associated colon tumorigenesis in mice treated with azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) and the impact of these polysaccharides on the intestinal . NVPS were administered to mice through an intragastric gavage for 14 weeks. Our results demonstrated that the treatment with NVPS significantly decreased the number and sizes of tumors and reduced the incidence of intestinal tumors. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR, we analyzed the bacterial composition of the fecal samples obtained from mice. The results demonstrated that the alterations in the abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes caused by the AOM/DSS treatment were significantly reversed in response to the NVPS treatment. Moreover, the short-chain fatty  (SCFA)-producing genera, including butyric -producing genera (Butyricicoccus, Butyrivibrio and Butyricimonas) and acetic -producing genera (Lachnospiraceae UCG 001, Lachnospiraceae UCG 006, and Blautia), were drastically enriched following the NVPS intervention. These compositional alterations induced by the NVPS were associated with the suppressed colonic inflammation and carcinogenesis. In conclusion, our results demonstrated an appreciable capability of NVPS to restore the gut  profile altered by AOM/DSS, indicating the potential of NVPS as a promising prebiotic candidate for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611860> gen. nov. sp. nov., a Novel Fumarate-Fermenting Microorganism From a Deep Fractured Carbonate Aquifer of the US Great Basin.</a></h2><p>Deep fractured rock ecosystems across most of North America have not been studied extensively. However, the US Great Basin, in particular the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS, formerly the Nevada Test Site), has hosted a number of influential subsurface investigations over the years. This investigation focuses on resident  recovered from a hydrogeologically confined aquifer in fractured Paleozoic carbonate rocks at 863 - 923 meters below land surface. Analysis of the microorganisms living in this oligotrophic environment provides a perspective into microbial metabolic strategies required to endure prolonged hydrogeological isolation deep underground. Here we present a microbiological and physicochemical characterization of a deep continental carbonate ecosystem and describe a bacterial genus isolated from the ecosystem. Strain DRI-13 is a strictly anaerobic, moderately thermophilic, fumarate-respiring member of the phylum . This bacterium grows optimally at 55°C and pH 8.0, can tolerate a concentration of 100 mM NaCl, and appears to obligately metabolize fumarate to acetate and succinate. Culture-independent 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicates a global subsurface distribution, while the closest cultured relatives of DRI-13 are  (90.0% similarity) and  (88.0% similarity). The predominant fatty  profile is iso-C  , C  , C   and C  . The percentage of the straight-chain fatty  C   is a defining characteristic not present in the other closely related species. The genome is estimated to be 3,649,665 bp, composed of 87.3% coding regions with an overall average of 45.1% G + C content. Strain DRI-13 represents a novel genus of subsurface bacterium isolated from a previously uncharacterized rock-hosted geothermal habitat. The characterization of the bacterium combined with the sequenced genome provides insights into metabolism strategies of the deep subsurface biosphere. Based on our characterization analysis we propose the name  (DRI-13 = DSM 100382 = ATCC TSD-12).Copyright © 2019 Hamilton-Brehm, Stewart, Zavarin, Caldwell, Lawson, Onstott, Grzymski, Neveux, Lollar, Russell and Moser.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583160>Volatile Organic Compounds as Biomarkers of Gastrointestinal Diseases and Nutritional Status.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this review was to identify the best solution for rapid and noninvasive diagnosis and long-term monitoring of patients affected by inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases, colon and gastric cancer, obesity in correlation to diet, and breast milk to evaluate exposure to VOCs in women and infants.This review included 20 previously published eligible studies. VOC analysis has allowed us to highlight differences in lifestyles, intestinal , and metabolism. New innovative methods have been described that allow the detection and quantification of a broad spectrum of metabolites present in exhaled breath even at very low levels, some of which have been shown to be indicators of pathological conditions.Five studies were analyzed that involved VOC analysis in relation to type of diet. All of them showed that the type of diet can have an impact on metabolites excreted and therefore can be a useful tool in the nutritional studies related to metabolism and health and disease status. Two studies concerned VOC analysis in inflammatory bowel diseases, and the results showed that VOCs can distinguish active disease from remission; VOC profile is clearly different in patients. In particular, CH 1-pentadecene, 3-methyl-1-butanal, octane, acetic , alpha-pinene, and m-cymene are elevated in active ulcerative colitis. Four studies examined VOCs in gastric and colorectal tumors showing a change in metabolic biomarkers of cancer patients compared to the control group. Finally, the study of VOCs in breast milk has improved the understanding of the potential health risks of exposure of children to chemical pollutants.VOC analysis allowed to highlight differences in behavior, lifestyle, and metabolism of individuals. Analytical methods are continuously developed to allow for better detection and quantification of metabolites, thus enabling the detection of a broader spectrum of pathophysiology and disease biomarkers.Copyright © 2019 Mariangela Rondanelli et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588753>Regulatory Effects of Stachyose on Colonic and Hepatic Inflammation, Gut  Dysbiosis, and Peripheral CD4 T Cell Distribution Abnormality in High-Fat Diet-Fed Mice.</a></h2><p>A long-term high-fat diet (HFD) can cause a range of health problems. Gut  plays a decisive role in the development of HFD-associated inflammation, involved in function of T cells. This study was designed to probe the regulative effects of dietary stachyose, a functional oligosaccharide, on HFD-induced weight gain, inflammation, gut  dysbiosis, and T cell abnormality in C57Bl/6 mice. Mice were divided into three groups which received normal chow, HFD and HFD plus stachyose (400 mg/kg), respectively. Results showed that administration of stachyose diminished the HFD-induced upregulation of serum TNF-α level and elevation of peripheral blood leukocyte populations to alleviate the HFD-caused colonic and hepatic inflammation in mice. Analysis of gut  revealed that stachyose improved the intestinal homeostasis of HFD-fed mice by improving the bacterial diversity with the increases in the relative abundances of the Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, , Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, and , as well as the fecal level of butanoic , while decreasing the ratio of -to- and the abundances of the Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, , , ,  and . Flow cytometric analysis showed that stachyose antagonized the HFD-induced decrease of peripheral CD4 T cell population in mice. Conclusively, these findings suggest that long-term consumption of stachyose can ameliorate the HFD-associated colonic and hepatic inflammation and its complications by modulating gut .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570003>The comprehensive pathophysiological changes in a novel rat model of postinflammatory visceral hypersensitivity.</a></h2><p>So far, a comprehensive animal model that can mimic both the central and peripheral pathophysiological changes of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is lacking. Here, we developed a novel IBS rat model combining trinitro-benzene-sulfonic  (TNBS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) (designated as TC-IBS) and compared it with the TNBS-induced and CUMS-induced models. TC-IBS showed a pronounced depression phenotype with increased corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor (CRHR)1 and CRHR2 expression at the frontal cortex and increased serum ACTH concentration. Visceral hypersensitivity (VH), as evidenced by colorectal distention (CRD) test, was highest in TC-IBS, accompanied by increased serum 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) level and colonic 5-HT receptor 3A (5-HTR)/5-HT receptor 2B expression, impaired tight junction protein expression including occludin, zonula occludens-1, and phosphorylated myosin light chain. Palonosetron, a second generation of 5-HTR antagonist, alleviated VH significantly in TC-IBS. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that TNBS plus CUMS induced a significant disturbance of the gut . Cytokine profile analysis of TC-IBS model indicated an innate immune activation both in serum and colonic mucosa. Further, fecal  transplantation improved VH and some pathophysiological changes in TC-IBS. In summary, we established a postinflammatory IBS model covering multifactorial pathophysiological changes, which may help to develop therapies that target specific IBS subtype.-Ma, J., Li, J., Qian, M., He, N., Cao, Y., Liu, Y., Wu, K., He, S.

Besides bacteria,  comprises yeasts, archaea, protists and viruses, neglected actors in inflammatory bowel disease-associated . In the past, a great limitation in studying  composition was the low sensitivity of sequencing technologies and that few computational approaches were sufficient to thoroughly analyse the whole microbiome. However, new cutting-edge technologies in nucleic  sequencing, -omics analysis and the innovative statistics and bioinformatics pipelines made possible more sensitive and accurate metagenomics, ultimately identifying novel players in intestinal inflammation, including prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses, that together form the gut virome. The discovery of peculiar inflammatory bowel disease-associated microbial strains will not only shed new light on inflammatory bowel disease aetiogenesis, they may also support the development of novel therapeutic strategies not merely treating symptoms, but precisely counteracting the primary cause of chronic intestinal inflammation.© Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31556210>Abundance of Probiotics and Butyrate-Production Microbiome Manages Constipation via Short-Chain Fatty  Production and Hormones Secretion.</a></h2><p>The characteristics of gut  and host metabolism are hypothesized to be associated with constipation status, but the regulation mechanism is not fully understood. Thus, the current study investigates the effect of constipation symptoms on gut functionality following the modulation of gut  and metabolites via dietary fiber intervention.Constipation causes a significantly reduced short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) production and a higher level of iso-butyrate. The feces of constipated people are characterized with inhibited Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcaceae and Roseburia abundance. Desulfovibrionaceae is identified to be an important endotoxin producer in constipated patients, and a butyrate-enriched SCFAs profile achieved by dietary fiber supplement accelerates gastrointestinal transit and increases the thickness of the mucosal layer, possibly through triggering the secretion of colonic hormones and enhancing the expression of tight junction proteins for maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. More importantly, an interacting regulatory mechanism among SCFAs, in particular butyrate and propionate, may be involved in signaling between the microbiome and host cells in the colon.Gut , characterized with enriched butyrate-producing and depressed Desulfovibrionaceae bacteria, attenuates constipation symptoms through promoting intestinal hormones secretion and maintaining gut barrier integrity.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A group of gastroenterologists and experts on nutrition, toxicology, microbiology, and endocrinology reviewed and analyzed the published literature on the topic. The working group formulated conclusions, based on the scientific evidence published, to give an opinion with respect to NCS ingestion. Current evidence does not confirm the carcinogenic potential of NCSs. However, the studies analyzed showed that saccharin could have a proinflammatory effect and that polyols can cause gastrointestinal symptoms and manifestations, depending on the dose and type of compound. The ingestion of xylitol, erythritol, sucralose, aspartame, acesulfame K, and saccharin could increase the secretion of the gastrointestinal hormones that regulate intestinal motility, and stevia and its derivatives could have a favorable effect on the percentage of liver fat. Caution should be taken in recommending aspartame consumption in patients with chronic liver disease because it reduces the ratio of branched-chain amino  to aromatic amino . In addition, NCS ingestion could modify the composition of the intestinal , having an effect on gastrointestinal symptoms and manifestations. It is important to continue conducting causality studies on humans to be able to establish recommendations on NSC consumption.Copyright © 2019 Asociación Mexicana de Gastroenterología.

The pathogenic process may potentially affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract, but a selective location in the terminal ileum was reported in 50% of patients.To characterize clinical sub-phenotypes (colonic and/or ileal) within the same disease, in order to identify new therapeutic targets.14 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for ileal CD were recruited for this study. Peripheral blood samples from each patient were collected and the main polymorphisms of the gene  (R702W, G908R, and 1007fs) were analyzed in each sample. In addition, tissue samples were taken from both the tract affected by CD and from the apparently healthy and disease-free margins (internal controls). We used a multiplex gene assay in specimens obtained from patients with ileal localization of CD to evaluate the simultaneous expression of 24 genes involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. We also processed surgery gut samples with routine light microscopy (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques to evaluate their structural and ultrastructural features.We found a significant increase of Th17 (IL17A and IL17F, IL 23R and CCR6) and Th1 (IFN-γ) gene expression in inflamed mucosa compared to non-inflamed sites of 14 CD patients.  and , two genes coding for antimicrobial peptides, were also strongly activated in inflamed ileal mucosa, suggesting the overwhelming stimulation of epithelial cells by commensal . IFN-γ and CCR6 were more expressed in inflamed mucosa of CD patients with ileal localization compared with patients with colonic localization suggesting a more aggressive inflammation process in this site. Morphological analysis of the epithelial lining of Lieberkün crypts disclosed enhanced release activity from goblet mucocytes, whereas the  propria contained numerous cells pertaining to various lines.We observed that the expression of ileal genes related to Th1 and Th17 activity is strongly activated as well as the expression of genes involved in  regulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575408>Probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG prevents progesterone metabolite epiallaopregnanolone sulfate-induced hepatic bile  accumulation and liver injury.</a></h2><p>Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is gestation-specific liver disease associated with liver injury and increased serum and hepatic bile . Although the mechanism of ICP is still not fully understood, the reproductive hormones seem to play an important role. Recent studies show that a progesterone metabolite, epiallopregnanolone sulfate (PM5S), is supraphysiologically elevated in the serum of ICP patients, indicating it may play an etiology role in ICP. Bile  homeostasis is controlled by multiple mechanisms including farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-mediated bile  export and synthesis. It is known that cholic  (CA), a primary bile , can activate FXR, which is inhibited by PM5S, an FXR antagonist. Here we employed a mouse model of concurrent exposure of CA and PM5S-induced liver injury and determined the effects of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in the prevention of the bile  disorders and liver injury. Mice challenged with CA + PM5S had significantly increased levels of serum and hepatic bile  and bilirubin and liver enzyme. Pretreatment with LGG significantly reduced bile  and bilirubin levels associated with reduced liver enzyme level and mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We also showed that the beneficial effects of LGG is likely mediated by hepatic FXR activation and bile salt export pump (BSEP) upregulation. In conclusion, our results provide a rationale for the application of probiotics in the management of ICP through gut -mediated FXR activation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We have previously demonstrated alterations in gut  composition and functions in patients with alcohol overconsumption, and now aimed to investigate possible associations between cytokine levels, gut  and clinical symptoms.We included hospital inpatients with a history of chronic alcohol overconsumption. For comparison, we included control patients with a low alcohol intake. Cytokine levels (TGF-β1, TNF-α, IL-10, IL-8, IL-6, IFN-γ, MCP-1, IL-1RA, IL-1β and IL-17) were determined using a customized V-plex assay. We then examined associations of cytokine levels with the abundance of Proteobacteria and Faecalibacterium, percentage of the short-chain fatty  butyrate, psychiatric symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and biochemical liver variables.We included 28 patients with alcohol overconsumption (79% men), and 25 control patients (72% men). Patients with alcohol overconsumption had higher levels of IL-6 (p = 0.002), IFN-γ (p = 0.018) and MCP-1 (p = 0.006), and lower levels of TGF-β1 (p = 0.017) compared with control patients. Inverse correlations were found between Proteobacteria abundance and TNF-α (R = -0.55, p = 0.02) and IL-8 (R = -0.58, p = 0.014), and between Faecalibacterium and MCP-1 levels (R = -0.56, p = 0.02) in the control patients, but not in patients with alcohol overconsumption. Patients with alcohol overconsumption reported more psychiatric symptoms, and these symptoms were inversely correlated with IL-10 levels. There were positive correlations between several of the assessed cytokines and biochemical liver variables, and negative correlations between cytokine levels and albumin.Patients with alcohol overconsumption had a cytokine profile suggestive of increased systemic inflammatory activity, with higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IFN-γ and MCP-1) and lower levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-β1).

Gastro-oesophageal reflux has recently emerged as a major co-morbidity in CF and is often associated with the presence of bile  in the lungs most likely by (micro) aspiration. In order to investigate whether bile may select for genetic variants,  was experimentally evolved in artificial sputum medium, a synthetic media resembling environmental conditions found within the CF lung. Pigmented derivatives of  emerged exclusively in the presence of bile. Genome sequencing analysis identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in quorum sensing () and both the pyocyanin () and pyomelanin () biosynthetic pathways. Phenotypic analysis revealed an altered bile response when compared to the ancestral  progenitor strain. While the recovered pigmented derivatives retained the bile mediated suppression of swarming motility and enhanced antibiotic tolerance, the biofilm, and redox responses to bile were abolished in the adapted mutants. Though loss of pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) production in the pigmented isolates was not linked to the altered biofilm response, the loss of redox repression could be explained by defective alkyl-quinolone (AQ) production in the presence of bile. Collectively, these findings suggest that the adaptive variants of  that arise following long term bile exposure enables the emergence of ecologically competitive sub-populations.

Differences between genotypes at different taxonomic levels were found, A. muciniphila presented greater abundance in APOE4 genotype, but was reduced by CPF exposure. APOE and CPF influenced cerebral SCFAs, with APOE3 genotype showing the highest levels of acetic, propionic and butyric  and CPF exposure inducing the highest levels of isovaleric and 4-methylvaleric .

This study explored the effects of different protein sources on the growth performance, diarrhea rate, apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of crude protein (CP), colonic mucin chemotypes, colonic microbiome, and microbial metabolites of piglets. Twenty-four piglets were randomly divided into four groups that received isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diets containing either Palbio 50 RD (P50), Soyppt-50% (S50), concentrated degossypolized cottonseed protein (CDCP), or fish meal (FM) as the sole protein source. The experimental diets did not affect the estimated daily gain (EDG), but P50 increased fecal score compared with S50 and CDCP. CDCP increased, but P50 reduced AID of CP in comparison to FM and S50. S50 and CDCP increased the amount of mixed neutral-acidic mucins relative to P50. Venn analysis identified unique OTUs in the P50 (13), CDCP (74), FM (39), and S50 (31) groups. The protein sources did not change the colonic bacterial richness or diversity. High  abundance in the P50 and FM, great abundant of  in the CDCP, and high  abundance in the S50 were found. The CDCP tended to elevate valeric  and branched chain fatty  (BCFA) concentrations compared with the other diets. The P50 and FM groups had greater ammonia nitrogen and methylamine contents than the S50 and CDCP groups. There was a positive correlation between the  and ammonia nitrogen, the  and short chain fatty  (SCFA), and a negative correlation between the  and BCFA. These findings suggested short-term feeding of different protein sources did not affect the piglets' growth, but P50 increased the diarrhea rate. Potential pathogenic bacteria and detrimental metabolites appeared in the colons of piglets fed P50 and FM, whereas, beneficial effects were conferred upon piglets fed CDCP and S50, thus indicating that available plant proteins (cotton seed, soy) added to the diets of piglets enhanced colon health by reducing protein fermentation.Copyright © 2019 Li, Chang, Hou, Song, Fan, He and Hou.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671166>Altered , fecal lactate, and fecal bile  in dogs with gastrointestinal disease.</a></h2><p>The intestinal  plays an important role in health and disease and produces, through fermentative reactions, several metabolic products, such as lactate, that can affect the host. The  also interacts with and metabolizes compounds produced by the host, such as primary bile . Lactate and bile  (BA) are of particular interest in gastrointestinal diseases because they have been associated with metabolic acidosis and bile  diarrhea, respectively. The objectives of this study were to validate an enzymatic assay to quantify D-, L-, and total lactate in canine feces, and to characterize fecal lactate and BA concentrations as well as bacterial abundances in healthy dogs and dogs with gastrointestinal diseases. Fecal samples were collected from 34 healthy dogs, 15 dogs with chronic enteropathy (CE), and 36 dogs with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). Lactate was quantified with an enzymatic assay, BA with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and 11 bacterial groups with qPCR. A fecal lactate reference interval was established from 34 healthy dogs and was 0.7-1.4 mM, 0.3-6.0 mM, and 1.0-7.0 mM for D-, L-, and total lactate, respectively. The assay to measure D-, L-, and total lactate in canine fecal samples was linear, accurate, precise, and reproducible. Significant increases in fecal lactate and decreases in secondary BA concentrations were observed in dogs with CE and dogs with EPI. Dogs with EPI had an increased abundance of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium; a decreased abundance of Fusobacterium and Clostridium hiranonis; and a higher Dysbiosis Index when compared to healthy dogs. Further studies are necessary to determine the clinical utility of lactate and BA quantification in canine feces. These metabolites suggest functional alterations of intestinal dysbiosis and may become promising targets for further elucidating the role of the  in health and disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584976>Ceftiofur formulation differentially affects the intestinal drug concentration, resistance of fecal Escherichia coli, and the microbiome of steers.</a></h2><p>Antimicrobial drug concentrations in the gastrointestinal tract likely drive antimicrobial resistance in enteric bacteria. Our objective was to determine the concentration of ceftiofur and its metabolites in the gastrointestinal tract of steers treated with ceftiofur crystalline-free  (CCFA) or ceftiofur hydrochloride (CHCL), determine the effect of these drugs on the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of fecal Escherichia coli, and evaluate shifts in the microbiome. Steers were administered either a single dose (6.6 mg/kg) of CCFA or 2.2 mg/kg of CHCL every 24 hours for 3 days. Ceftiofur and its metabolites were measured in the plasma, interstitium, ileum and colon. The concentration and MIC of fecal E. coli and the fecal  composition were assessed after treatment. The maximum concentration of ceftiofur was higher in all sampled locations of steers treated with CHCL. Measurable drug persisted longer in the intestine of CCFA-treated steers. There was a significant decrease in E. coli concentration (P = 0.002) within 24 hours that persisted for 2 weeks after CCFA treatment. In CHCL-treated steers, the mean MIC of ceftiofur in E. coli peaked at 48 hours (mean MIC = 20.45 ug/ml, 95% CI = 10.29-40.63 ug/ml), and in CCFA-treated steers, mean MIC peaked at 96 hours (mean MIC = 10.68 ug/ml, 95% CI = 5.47-20.85 ug/ml). Shifts in the microbiome of steers in both groups were due to reductions in Firmicutes and increases in Bacteroidetes. CCFA leads to prolonged, low intestinal drug concentrations, and is associated with decreased E. coli concentration, an increased MIC of ceftiofur in E. coli at specific time points, and shifts in the fecal . CHCL led to higher intestinal drug concentrations over a shorter duration. Effects on E. coli concentration and the microbiome were smaller in this group, but the increase in the MIC of ceftiofur in fecal E. coli was similar.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635446> P2P3, a human gut bacterium having a strong non-gelatinized resistant starch-degrading activity.</a></h2><p>Resistant starch (RS) is metabolized by gut  and involved in the production of short chain fatty , which are related to a variety of physiological and health effects. Therefore, the availability of RS as a prebiotic is a topic of interest and research on gut bacteria that can decompose RS is also important. The objectives in this study were 1) to isolate human gut bacterium having strong degradation activity on non-gelatinized RS, 2) to characterize its RS-degrading characteristics, and 3) to investigate its probiotic effects including a growth stimulation effect on other gut bacteria and an immunomodulatory effect.  P2P3 showing very strong RS granule utilization activity was isolated. It can attach to RS granules and form the clusters of RS granules. Also, it was able to utilize high amylose corn starch (HACS) granules up to 63.3%, and efficiently decompose other various types of commercial RS without gelatinization. In a coculture experiment,  ATCC 29148, isolated from human feces, were capable to grow using carbon sources generated from RS granules by  P2P3. In addition,  P2P3 demonstrated the ability to stimulate secretion of Th1 type cytokines from mouse macrophages  that was not shown in other .

Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) is an end product in the human liver; however, mouse Cyp2c70 metabolizes CDCA to hydrophilic muricholic  (MCAs). Moreover, in humans the gut  converts the primary BAs cholic  and CDCA into deoxycholic  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA), respectively. In contrast, the mouse Cyp2a12 reverts this action and converts these secondary BAs to primary BAs. Here we generated Cyp2a12 KO, Cyp2c70 KO and Cyp2a12/Cyp2c70 double knockout (DKO) mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to study the regulations of BA metabolism under hydrophobic BA composition. Cyp2a12 KO mice showed the accumulation of DCAs, whereas Cyp2c70 KO mice lacked MCAs and exhibited markedly increased hepatobiliary proportions of CDCA. In DKO mice, not only DCAs or CDCAs but DCAs, CDCAs and LCAs were all elevated. In Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, chronic liver inflammation was observed depending on the hepatic unconjugated CDCA concentrations. The BA pool was markedly reduced in Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, but the farnesoid X receptor was not activated. It was suggested that the cytokine/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and the pregnane X receptor-mediated pathway are the predominant mechanisms, preferred over the FXR/SHP and FXR/FGF15 pathways, for controlling BA synthesis under hydrophobic BA composition. From our results, we hypothesize that these KO mice can be novel and useful models for investigating the roles of hydrophobic BAs in various human diseases.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586220>In-Vitro Prebiotic Analysis of  Accessible Pectic Polysaccharides.</a></h2><p>Pectin is a diverse polysaccharide comprising of polygalacturonic , rhamnogalactouronan, and neutral polysaccharides (arabinan and arabinogalactan) as side chains or branches. They are resistant to salivary amylase and gastric juice. In the present study the prebiotic potentials of different pectic derived substrates were performed by using intestinal cultures and measuring the growth, change in pH and short chain fatty , (SCFA) production. Arabinan, arabinogalactan, and rhamnogalacturonan were fermented by probiotic bacteria such as Bifidobacterium breve, Bi. longum, Bi. bifidum, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (commensal bacteria). While, polygalacturonic  was fermented by Ba. fragilis, Ba. thetaiotaomicron, and Ba. uniformis. All the screened bacteria significantly decreased the pH from 7 to 5 (pH difference of ≈ 2), which clearly indicated that the above bacteria produced the enzymes necessary for the digestion of the pectic derived polysaccharides. The SCFA profiles of the above screened bacteria clearly demonstrated the production of lactate, acetate and propionate which are the key metabolites involved in maintaining gut health and prevention of several intestinal diseases.

In this study, an integrated high-throughput absolute abundance quantification (iHAAQ) method was applied to study the dynamics of microbial community and the characteristics of microorganism. The results showed a significant difference in bacterial community with diversity being higher in watershed area. The main influential factors for bacterial communities in watershed were physicochemical properties (e.g., pH and potassium), while in mining areas the main driving factors were metals/metalloids (e.g., As, Zn, and Pb). Notably, the major functions of microbial community were transporter and ABC transporter in mining area, while two-component system was more abundant in watershed by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation analysis (level 3). In particular, Phyllobacterium, Bacteroides, and Sulfurovum were demonstrated to be potentially useful bacterial species for bioremediation, which should be a good choice for future studies. These results could facilitate our understanding of microbial diversity in different sediments of mining areas and identify microbial communities for bioremediation projects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Changes in gut microbiome composition have been linked to a number of neurodegenerative diseases, indicating a role for the gut-brain axis. Here, we show how specific gut-derived bacterial strains can modulate neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes  through the production of specific metabolites and discuss the potential therapeutic implications for neurodegenerative disorders. A panel of fifty gut bacterial strains was screened for their ability to reduce pro-inflammatory IL-6 secretion in U373 glioblastoma astrocytoma cells.  MRx0005 and  MRx0029 had the strongest capacity to reduce IL-6 secretion . Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and both bacterial strains displayed intrinsic antioxidant capacity. While MRx0005 showed a general antioxidant activity on different brain cell lines, MRx0029 only protected differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells from chemically induced oxidative stress. MRx0029 also induced a mature phenotype in undifferentiated neuroblastoma cells through upregulation of microtubule-associated protein 2. Interestingly, short-chain fatty  analysis revealed that MRx0005 mainly produced C1-C3 fatty , while MRx0029 produced C4-C6 fatty , specifically butyric, valeric and hexanoic . None of the short-chain fatty  tested protected neuroblastoma cells from chemically induced oxidative stress. However, butyrate was able to reduce neuroinflammation , and the combination of butyrate and valerate induced neuronal maturation, albeit not to the same degree as the complex cell-free supernatant of MRx0029. This observation was confirmed by solvent extraction of cell-free supernatants, where only MRx0029 methanolic fractions containing butyrate and valerate showed an anti-inflammatory activity in U373 cells and retained the ability to differentiate neuroblastoma cells. In summary, our results suggest that the pleiotropic nature of live biotherapeutics, as opposed to isolated metabolites, could be a promising novel drug class in drug discovery for neurodegenerative disorders.Copyright © 2019 Ahmed, Busetti, Fotiadou, Vincy Jose, Reid, Georgieva, Brown, Dunbar, Beurket-Ascencio, Delday, Ettorre and Mulder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668625>Rhizosphere-Associated Pseudomonas Suppress Local Root Immune Responses by Gluconic -Mediated Lowering of Environmental pH.</a></h2><p>The root microbiome consists of commensal, pathogenic, and plant-beneficial microbes [1]. Most members of the root microbiome possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens [2]. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host immunity and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root , including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [5, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root microbiome. In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic  and its derivative 2-keto gluconic . Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic  and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic -mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root immunity. Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root microbiome, as it facilitates colonization by beneficial root .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal  were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/B index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate metabolism" were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and energy utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty  (caproate, 2-methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic  to increase utilization of carbohydrates and energy, enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

LC-PUFAs are structural constituents of the central nervous system (CNS), being essential in retinal development or hippocampal plasticity. Recently, components of the milk fat globule membrane (MFG) are being added to infant formulas because of their key role in infant's development. A high intake of proteins induces a faster weight gain during infancy which correlates with later obesity. Digestible carbohydrates provide glucose, crucial for an adequate functioning of CNS; nondigestible carbohydrates [e.g. human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs)] are the main carbon source for gut bacteria. Iron-deficiency anemia during infancy has been associated with alterations of mental and psychomotor development. Folate metabolism, closely related to vitamins B6 and B12, controls epigenetic changes, whereas inadequate status of vitamin D affects bone development, but may also increase intestinal permeability and alter gut  composition.LC-PUFAs, proteins, carbohydrates, iron, and vitamins during early life are critical for infant's growth, neurodevelopment, and the establishment and functioning of gut .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31568850>Lotus seed oligosaccharides at various dosages with prebiotic activity regulate gut  and relieve constipation in mice.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of lotus seed oligosaccharides (formulation consisting of LSO2, LSO3-1, LSO3-2 and LSO4; relative ratios are 1.107:0.554:0.183:0.443, m/m/m/m) at dosages of 0.42, 0.83 g/d/kg bw and 2.49 g/d/kg bw on the  composition and the propulsion of intestinal contents in the gut of mice.

At the same time, the number of short-chain fatty  (SCFA) bacterial producers increased after feeding with oligosaccharides; Lotus seed oligosaccharides (LOS) also enhanced the concentration of SCFAs in the intestine, which also increased the concentration of cytokines in the serum of mice.

In recent years, the diversity of the gut  has emerged to play a significant role in the occurrence of major depressive disorder and other mood and anxiety disorders. Importantly, the role of the gut  in the treatment of such disorders remains to be elucidated. Here, we provide a review of the literature regarding the effects of physiologically relevant concentrations of serotonin reuptake inhibitors on the gut  and the implications this might have on their efficacy in the treatment of mood disorders.First, an estimation of gut serotonin reuptake inhibitor concentrations was computed based on pharmacokinetic and gastrointestinal transit properties of serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Literature regarding the in vivo and in vitro antimicrobial properties of serotonin reuptake inhibitors was gathered, and the estimated gut concentrations were examined in the context of these data. Computer-based investigation revealed putative mechanisms for the antimicrobial effects of serotonin reuptake inhibitors.In vivo evidence using animal models shows an antimicrobial effect of serotonin reuptake inhibitors on the gut . Examination of the estimated physiological concentrations of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the gastrointestinal tract collected from in vitro studies suggests that the microbial community of both the small intestine and the colon are exposed to serotonin reuptake inhibitors for at least 4 hours per day at concentrations that are likely to exert an antimicrobial effect. The potential mechanisms of the effect of serotonin reuptake inhibitors on the gut  were postulated to include inhibition of efflux pumps and/or amino  transporters.This review raises important issues regarding the role that gut  play in the treatment of mood-related behaviours, which holds substantial potential clinical outcomes for patients suffering from major depressive disorder and other mood-related disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596218>Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Systemic Hypertension: Gut Dysbiosis as the Mediator?</a></h2><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and systemic hypertension (SH) are common and interrelated diseases. It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut dysbiosis, OSA and gut dysbiosis, and whether gut dysbiosis is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut dysbiosis." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing gut dysbiosis at an early stage through prebiotics and probiotics and fecal  transplantation combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH.

We performed a systematic review using the PubMed/Medline database including primary articles written in English that measured leptin production or levels as well as SCFA used as an intervention, mechanism or outcome. The search yielded a total of 573 citations; 36 studies were included in the final analysis. The quality of the studies was analyzed through two validated tools based on objective criteria. Overall, the studies presented low risk of bias to construct and statistical validity. However, the majority presented a high risk of attrition and detection bias. In vitro studies (n = 8) consistently demonstrated that SCFA stimulate leptin expression in adipocytes through activation of free fatty  receptor 3 (FFAR3). In animal studies (n = 24), interventions to modulate high-fat diet outcomes predominantly caused a decrease in circulating leptin levels and increased SCFA, associated with suppressed weight gain. Control of dysbiosis through administration of prebiotics and probiotics also played a role in leptin synthesis in animal studies. In human studies (n = 4) leptin was mainly correlated with adiposity but dysbiosis interfered with this relationship. We conclude that the association between SCFA and leptin remains incompletely understood but occurs mainly through the activation of FFAR3 in adipocytes. However, body fat rather than SCFA remains the main driver for leptin synthesis in vivo. Future studies should aim to better clarify the role of SCFA in regulating leptin production in vivo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The glutathione redox system with the EAE was measured in heart, kidney, liver, and small and large intestines. The LPS and the correlation with oxidative stress in the small and large intestines were also investigated. The results showed that (1) the oxidative damage in the EAE model affects non-nervous organs and tissues; (2) The LPS is related to inflammatory phenomena and oxidative stress in the intestinal tissue and in other organs; (3) The administration of EVOO, HT, and OA reduces the LPS levels at the same time as minimizing the oxidative damage; (4) EVOO, HT, and OA improve the disease's clinical score; and (5) on balance, EVOO offers a better neuroprotective effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565580>Dietary fermented products using  mold and sweet potato- distillery by-product promotes hepatic and serum cholesterol levels and modulates gut  in mice fed a high-cholesterol diet.</a></h2><p>It has been reported that fermented products (FPs) prepared from sweet potato- distillery by-product suppressed weight gain and decreased serum cholesterol levels in mice under normal dietary conditions. Furthermore, from the information gained from the above data regarding health benefits of the FPs, the aim of this study was evaluating the effects of dietary FPs on lipid accumulation and gut  in mice with or without cholesterol-load in the diet. C57BL/6N mice were fed normal (CO) diet, CO with 10% FPs (CO + FPs) diet, cholesterol loaded (HC) diet, or HC with 10% FPs (HC + FPs) diet for 8 weeks. The mice were then euthanized, and blood samples, tissue samples, and feces were collected. The adipose tissue weight and liver triglyceride levels in the HC + FPs diet groups were significantly reduced compared to that in the HC diet groups. However, FPs significantly increased the serum non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, the ratio of non-HDL-C to HDL-C and hepatic total cholesterol levels in mice fed cholesterol-loaded diet compared with that of the HC diet group. Since dietary FPs significantly decreased the protein expression levels of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase 1 in the HC + FPs diet groups, the cholesterol accumulation in FPs group may be explained by insufficient catabolism from cholesterol to bile . In addition, the dietary FPs tended to increase  cluster IV and XIVa, which are butyrate-producing bacteria. Related to the result, -butyrate was significantly increased in the CO + FPs and the HC + FPs diet groups compared to their respective control groups.

Although its therapeutic effect had been confirmed in previous studies, the mechanism was still unclear due to its poor solubility and low permeability. In this study, the pharmacological effect of XAN on Alzheimer's disease (AD) was confirmed by behavior experiments and H&E staining observation. Fecal  transplantation (FMT) experiment also replicated the therapeutic effects, which indicates the potential targets of XAN on gut . The sequencing of 16S rRNA genes in fecal samples demonstrated that XAN reversed gut  dysbiosis in AD animals. XAN could change the relative abundances of several phyla and genus of bacterial, particularly the ratio of . Among them, , , , and  had been reported to be involved in the pathologic developments of AD and other central nervous system disease. In metabolomics study, a series of host endogenous metabolites were detected, including amino , lysophosphatidylcholine, dihydrosphingosine, phytosphingosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine, which were all closely associated with the development of AD. Combined with the Spearman's correlation analysis, it was confirmed that the increases of five bacterial strains and decreases of six bacterial strains were closely correlated with the increases of nine host metabolites and the decreases of another five host metabolites. Therefore, XAN can modulate the structure of gut  in AD rats; the changes of gut  were significantly correlated with endogenous metabolites, and symptom of AD was ultimately alleviated. Our findings suggest that XAN may be a potential therapeutic drug for AD, and the gut  may be potential targeting territory of XAN  microbiome-gut-brain pathway.Copyright © 2019 Zhou, Tai, Xu, Lu and Meng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665909>Measuring the Antimicrobial Activity of Lauric  against Various Bacteria in Human Gut  Using a New Method.</a></h2><p>Lauric  (LA) has a broad spectrum of anti-microbiological activities against enveloped viruses and various bacteria, and might be useful to protect against microbial infection and control the balance and distribution of bacteria in human gut . It is not necessarily more difficult to measure antimicrobial activity the traditional way, but it is, however, more laborious. In the present study, we developed a new method to measure the antimicrobial activity of LA in multiple samples with a microplate reader. A "test complex" (TC) was produced consisting of 100 μL of agar medium with LA in the bottom layer and 300 μL of broth in the top layer in 96-well deep-well microplates. Afterward, analysis of the broth in the top layer showed that the antimicrobial activity was the same as that of the "control complex," (CC) which consisted of 100 μL of agar medium in the bottom layer and 300 μL of broth with LA in the top layer. Furthermore, evaluation of the antimicrobial effect of the TC when using a microplate reader was the same as that with the use of the colony counting method. The colony counting method has confirmed that the antimicrobial activity of LA when bacteria are inoculated into the broth was equivalent between CC and TC, and we validated this by correlating the number of bacteria with absorbance. In addition, the broth itself in TC was transparent enough that the turbidity of broth can be used as an index of the number of bacteria, which enabled the use of a microplate reader for multiple samples. For human gut microbes, LA was shown to have low antimicrobial activity against commensal lactic  bacteria, but high antimicrobial activity against pathogenic  and , suggesting that LA might modulate intestinal health, as confirmed by the proposed method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623169>Urolithin Metabotypes Can Determine the Modulation of Gut  in Healthy Individuals by Tracking Walnuts Consumption over Three Days.</a></h2><p>Walnuts are rich in polyphenols ellagitannins, modulate gut  (GM), and exert health benefits after long-term consumption. The metabolism of ellagitannins to urolithins via GM depends on urolithin metabotypes (UM-A, -B, or -0), which have been reported to predict host responsiveness to a polyphenol-rich intervention. This study aims to assess whether UMs were associated with differential GM modulation after short-term walnut consumption. In this study, 27 healthy individuals consumed 33 g of peeled raw walnuts over three days. GM profiling was determined using 16S rRNA illumina sequencing and specific real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs), as well as microbial activity using short-chain fatty  analysis in stool samples. UMs stratification of volunteers was assessed using ultra performance liquid chromatography-electro spray ionization-quadrupole time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) analysis of urolithins in urine samples. The gut  associated with UM-B was more sensitive to the walnut intervention. , and members of the Coriobacteriaceae family, including , increased exclusively in UM-B subjects, while some members of the Lachnospiraceae family decreased in UM-A individuals.  and  increased in both UMs and higher acetate and propionate production resulted after walnuts intake.

Three winemaking protocols, with different pre-fermentative management of grapes, were followed by plate count and next generation sequencing on 16S for bacteria and internal transcribed spacer sequencing (ITS) for yeast. Chemical and sensory characterization of wine was performed. The grape processing influenced the evolution of  (especially lactic and acetic  bacteria) and the fermentation rate. The highest biodiversity was observed in the experiment carried out with whole grapes and carbonic maceration, with the presence of bacterial groups not usually found in winemaking (Bacteroidales, Clostridiales, Oscillospira). The different microbiotas influenced the organic  profile of wines, the content of biogenic ammines and the perception of organoleptic descriptors linked to the vine cultivar (Syrah).Carbonic maceration impacts on the evolution of the  and the wine features. The absence of addition of starters and sulphur dioxide would seem to be correlated with the high microbial biodiversity.Carbonic maceration is a traditional winemaking practice, today there are difficulties in its managing because the anaerobiosis stimulates spoilage micro-organisms. The work elucidates the reasons of these difficulties and identified some microbial groups rarely associated with winemaking. The ratio of ethanol accumulation along with physical management of grapes and the supply of oxygen during the early stages of winemaking are powerful instruments of oenological variability, able to offer new possibilities to winemakers in order to defining the quality of red wines.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572604>Dose-dependent effects of kefir on colitis induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic  in rats.</a></h2><p>Evidence suggests that gut  dysbiosis plays a critical role in the initiation and promotion of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Kefir is a fermented dairy product including yeast and bacterial species. We aimed to investigate the effect of kefir on trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats using two different doses. Fifty-four Wistar rats were divided into six groups. For 14 days, the normal control and colitis control groups were given tap water, kefir10 control, kefir10 colitis, and kefir30 control, and the kefir30 colitis groups were given phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% or 30% kefir, respectively, instead of tap water. Colitis was induced by intracolonically administrating TNBS in the colitis control, kefir10 colitis, and kefir30 colitis groups. On the 14th day, the rats were sacrificed. The weights and lengths of the colons were measured and macroscopically evaluated, and the distal 10 cm segments were subjected to a histopathological examination. The incidence of bloody stool and diarrhea in the kefir10 colitis group was found to be less than the colitis control and kefir30 colitis groups. The colonic weight/length ratio in the kefir10 colitis group was lower than that in the colitis control and kefir30 colitis groups. We detected that the 10% kefir treatment reduced TNBS-induced macroscopic colonic damage, while it was exacerbated by the 30% kefir treatment. No significant difference was observed between the colitis groups in terms of microscopic colonic damage scoring. These results indicate that kefir, with a careful dose selection, may be a useful agent in the treatment of IBD.© 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of vancomycin (Vanc) and ciprofloxacin/metronidazole (CiMe) exposures on the gut microbiome and metabolome in the colonic content and tissue samples from advanced-stage type 1 diabetic (AST1D) rats and age-matched controls (AMCs) using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics. The results show that antibiotic effects on the gut  were stronger in AMC rats relative to AST1D rats. These microbial alterations were accompanied by a series of metabolic changes, including energy metabolism, short-chain fatty  metabolism, and amino  metabolism. We found that AMC rats had a more notable metabolic response to antibiotic exposure than AST1D rats. Additionally, Vanc had a stronger impact on the gut  and host metabolic phenotype versus CiMe. Therefore, our results reveal that antibiotic-induced shifts in the gut microbiome and metabolome are different between AST1D and AMC rats.

Understanding the biological characteristics of O. hupensis is a prerequisite for its control; however, there are currently no studies investigating the intestinal  of the O. hupensis snail. This study aimed to profile the intestinal microbiome of O. hupensis across different ecological landscapes in mainland China. DNA was extracted from the intestines of the collected snails and the bacterial communities were detected using 454 pyrosequencing. A total of 3,799 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained, and Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were identified as the dominant bacterial taxa at the phylum level. Bacillus and Lactococcus were the most common genera in samples obtained from the four ecological landscapes. Snail specimens were clustered into three clades according to microbial community diversity, and thirty-seven genera that contributed to differential  distributions were identified. Co-occurrence network analysis indicated a symbiotic relationship for the intestinal  of O. hupensis, and PICRUSt analysis predicted forty-one metabolic functions in all snail samples, including membrane transport, amino  metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, replication and repair, energy metabolism, as well as xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism. These findings improve our understanding of bacterial ecology in the O. hupensis intestine; further studies will focus on the relationship between O. hupensis intestinal  and the  in their specific ecological environments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, the effects of DADS on lipid metabolism and its potential role in the modulation of the gut microbiome were determined. Hematoxylin and eosin and oil‑red O staining were used to assess the liver and intestinal tissues of mice treated with DADS. The expression of lipid metabolism‑associated genes was measured using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR (RT‑qPCR). The effects of DADS on the gut microbiome were measured using 16S recombinant (r)DNA gene analysis. The results revealed that the serum non‑esterified free fatty , high density lipoprotein‑cholesterol, low density lipoprotein‑cholesterol, serum total cholesterol, liver triglyceride and total cholesterol levels of the mice fed with a low‑dose of DADS was significantly higher when compared with the control. Hematoxylin and eosin and oil‑red O staining demonstrated that DADS induced fatty liver in mice. The results of the RT‑qPCR revealed that the expression levels of a number of lipid metabolism‑associated genes were altered in the livers of mice treated with DADS. The 16S rDNA gene analysis demonstrated that the mice fed on a normal diet treated with a low‑dose of DADS had decreased levels of bacteria from the Bacteroidetes phyla and increased levels of bacteria from the Firmicutes phyla. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed the top 20 pathways enriched in the low‑dose DADS group of mice fed with a normal diet. In the present study, low‑dose DADS induced fatty liver and altered the gut , similar to the phenotype induced by a high fat diet, by regulating the expression of lipid metabolism associated genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559126>A Proresolving Peptide Nanotherapy for Site-Specific Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease by Regulating Proinflammatory Microenvironment and Gut .</a></h2><p>The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) increases steadily worldwide. There is an urgent need for effective and safe IBD therapies. Accelerated resolution of inflammation is a new strategy for the management of inflammatory diseases. For effective and safe IBD treatment, herein a smart nanotherapy (i.e. oxidation-responsive nanoparticles containing a proresolving annexin A1-mimetic peptide Ac2-26, defined as AON) is developed, which can release packaged Ac2-26, in response to highly expressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) at diseased sites. AON effectively protects Ac2-26 from degradation in the enzyme-rich environment of the gastrointestinal tract. By delivering this nanotherapy to the inflamed colons of mice with IBD, site-specific release and accumulation of Ac2-26 in response to high levels of ROS at the inflammatory sites are achieved. Mechanistically, the Ac2-26-containing, oxidation-labile nanotherapy AON effectively decreases the expression of proinflammatory mediators, attenuates trafficking and infiltration of inflammatory cells, promotes efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils, and increases phenotypic switching of macrophages. Therapeutically, AON reduces symptoms of inflammation, accelerates intestinal mucosal wound healing, reshapes the gut  composition, and increases short-chain fatty  production. Additionally, oral delivery of this nanomedicine shows excellent safety profile in a mouse model, conferring the confidence for further development of a targeted precision therapy for IBD and other inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585844>Bioremediation of a Common Product of Food Processing by a Human Gut Bacterium.</a></h2><p>Dramatic increases in processed food consumption represent a global health threat.

SCFAs obtained from the carbohydrate fermentation processes are crucial in maintaining gut homeostasis and their determination in stool samples could provide a faster, reliable and cheaper method to highlight the presence of an intestinal dysbiosis and a biomarker for various gut diseases. We hypothesize that different intestinal diseases, such as celiac disease (CD), adenomatous polyposis (AP) and colorectal cancer (CRC) could display a particular fecal SCFAs' signature.To compare the fecal SCFAs' profiles of CD, AP, CRC patients and healthy controls, using the same analytical method.In this cross-sectional study, we defined and compared the SCFAs' concentration in fecal samples of 9 AP, 16 CD, 19 CRC patients and 16 healthy controls (HC). The SCFAs' analysis were performed using a gas-chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry method. Data analysis was carried out using Wilcoxon rank-sum test to assess pairwise differences of SCFAs' profiles, partial least squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) to determine the status membership based on distinct SCFAs' profiles, and Dirichlet regression to determine factors influencing concentration levels of SCFAs.We have not observed any difference in the SCFAs' amount and composition between CD and healthy control. On the contrary, the total amount of SCFAs was significantly lower in CRC patients compared to HC ( = 0.044) and CD ( = 0.005). Moreover, the SCFAs' percentage composition was different in CRC and AP compared to HC. In detail, HC displayed higher percentage of acetic  ( value = 1.3 × 10) and a lower amount of butyric ( value = 0.02192), isobutyric ( value = 7.4 × 10), isovaleric ( value = 0.00012) and valeric ( value = 0.00014)  compared to CRC patients. AP showed a lower abundance of acetic  ( value = 0.00062) and higher percentages of propionic ( value = 0.00433) and isovaleric ( value = 0.00433)  compared to HC. Moreover, AP showed higher levels of propionic  ( value = 0.03251) and a lower level of isobutyric  ( value = 0.00427) in comparison to CRC. The PLS-DA model demonstrated a significant separation of CRC and AP groups from HC, although some degree of overlap was observed between CRC and AP.Analysis of fecal SCFAs shows the potential to provide a non-invasive means of diagnosis to detect patients with CRC and AP, while CD patients cannot be discriminated from healthy subjects.©The Author(s) 2019.

Modification of gut  and repression of BA synthesis are potential strategies for the treatment of cholestatic liver disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects and to understand the mechanisms of the probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), on hepatic bile  synthesis, liver injury and fibrosis in bile-duct ligation (BDL) and Mdr2 mice. Global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors were used to dissect the role of FXR. LGG treatment significantly attenuated liver inflammation, injury and fibrosis with a significant reduction of hepatic BAs in BDL mice. Hepatic concentration of T-βMCA, an FXR antagonist, was markedly increased in BDL mice and reduced in LGG-treated mice, while chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), an FXR agonist, was decreased in BDL mice and normalized in LGG-treated mice. LGG treatment significantly increased the expression of serum and ileum FGF15 and subsequently reduced hepatic CYP7A1 and BA synthesis in BDL and Mdr2 mice. At the molecular level, these changes were reversed by global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors in BDL mice. In addition, LGG treatment altered gut , which was associated with increased BA de-conjugation and increased fecal and urine BA excretion both in BDL and Mdr2 mice. In vitro studies showed that LGG suppressed the inhibitory effect of T-βMCA on FXR and FGF19 expression in Caco-2 cells. Conclusion: LGG supplementation decreases hepatic BA by increasing intestinal FXR/FGF15 signaling pathway-mediated suppression of BA de novo synthesis and enhances BA excretion, which prevents excessive BA-induced liver injury and fibrosis in mice.© 2019 The Authors.

Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) reduces cholesterol via its conversion into bile  (BAs). During RCT in non-hepatic peripheral tissues, cholesterol is transferred to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and returned to the liver for conversion into BAs predominantly via the rate-limiting enzyme, cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). Numerous reports have described that polyphenol induced increases in BA excretion and corresponding reductions in total and LDL cholesterol in animal and in-vitro studies, but the process whereby this occurs has not been extensively reviewed. There are three main mechanisms by which BA excretion can be augmented: (1) increased expression of CYP7A1; (2) reduced expression of intestinal BA transporters; and (3) changes in the gut . Here we summarise the BA metabolic pathways focusing on CYP7A1, how its gene is regulated via transcription factors, diurnal rhythms, and microRNAs. Importantly, we will address the following questions: (1) Can polyphenols enhance BA secretion by modulating the CYP7A1 biosynthetic pathway? (2) Can polyphenols alter the BA pool via changes in the gut ? (3) Which polyphenols are the most promising candidates for future research? We conclude that while in rodents some polyphenols induce CYP7A1 expression predominantly by the LXRα pathway, in human cells, this may occur through FXR, NF-KB, and ERK signalling. Additionally, gut  is important for the de-conjugation and excretion of BAs. Puerarin, resveratrol, and quercetin are promising candidates for further research in this area.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554129>Effect of potato fiber on survival of Lactobacillus species at simulated gastric conditions and composition of the gut  in vitro.</a></h2><p>Potato fiber is a side product in starch manufacturing rich in dietary fibers such as pectin, cellulose, hemicellulose and resistant starch. So far, the beneficial properties of potato fiber have been poorly characterized. This study investigated the effect of FiberBind 400, a commercial potato fiber product, on survival of probiotic Lactobacillus strains at simulated gastric conditions and on the composition and metabolic activity of the gut , using the TIM-2 colon model. Resistant starch and native starch from potato were used as reference substrates. FiberBind 400 had an ability to improve survival of the four tested strains, Lactobacillus fermentum PCC®, L. rhamnosus LGG®, L. reuteri RC-14® and L. paracasei F-19® in a strain-dependent way. The highest effect was observed for L. fermentum PCC® and L. rhamnosus LGG®. The effect of starches on bacterial survival was insignificant. Composition of the fecal  in TIM-2 fermentations was assessed by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicon. Fermentation of FiberBind 400 resulted in more diverse microbial communities compared to starches. Changes in microbial abundances specifically mediated by FiberBind 400, included increases in the genera Lachnospira, Butyrivibrio, Mogibacterium, Parabacteroides, Prevotella and Desulfovibrio, and the species B. ovatus, as well as decreases in Ruminococcus torques and unassigned Ruminococcus spp. Shifts in other bacterial populations, such as increased abundances of Oscillospira, Enterococcus, Bacteroidales, Citrobacter, along with reduction of Roseburia, Ruminococcus, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were not significantly different between the substrates. Cumulative production of individual short-chain fatty  was similar between potato fiber and starches. The study demonstrated that FiberBind 400 had a potential to protect probiotic Lactobacillus strains during the passage through the gastrointestinal tract and selectively modulate the gut bacterial populations. This knowledge can support application of potato fiber as a functional food ingredient with added biological benefits.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Pooled cecal contents collected from obese leptin-deficient (Ob) mice or C57Bl/6j control (Con) mice were transplanted by oral gavage into cohorts of recipient Ob and Con mice maintained on identical low-fat diets for 8 weeks (n=9-11/group). Cardiovascular pathology was assessed as the degree of arterial stiffness (aortic pulse wave velocity) and myocardial infarct size following a 45/120 min  global cardiac ischemia/reperfusion protocol. Gut  was characterized by 16s rDNA sequencing, along with measures of intestinal barrier function and cecal short-chain fatty  (SCFA) composition. Following CMT, the gut  of recipient mice was altered to resemble that of the donors. Ob CMT to Con mice increased arterial stiffness, left ventricular (LV) mass and myocardial infarct size, which was associated with greater gut permeability and reduced cecal SCFA concentrations. Conversely, Con CMT to Ob mice increased cecal SCFA, reduced LV mass and attenuated myocardial infarct size, with no effects on gut permeability or arterial stiffness. Collectively, these data demonstrate that obesity-related changes in the gut , independent of dietary manipulation, regulate hallmark measures of cardiovascular pathology in mice, and highlight the potential of -targeted therapeutics for reducing cardiovascular pathology and risk in obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597349>Celiac Disease and the Microbiome.</a></h2><p>Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that changes in both the composition and function of the intestinal microbiome are associated with a number of chronic inflammatory diseases including celiac disease (CD). One of the major advances in the field of microbiome studies over the last few decades has been the development of culture-independent approaches to identify and quantify the components of the human . The study of nucleic  DNA and RNA found in feces or other biological samples bypasses the need for tissue cultures and also allows the characterization of non-cultivable microbes. Current evidence on the composition of the intestinal microbiome and its role as a causative trigger for CD is highly heterogeneous and sometimes contradictory. This review is aimed at summarizing both pre-clinical (basic science data) and clinical (cross-sectional and prospective studies) evidence addressing the relationship between the intestinal microbiome and CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605240>Elevated serum ceramides are linked with obesity-associated gut dysbiosis and impaired glucose metabolism.</a></h2><p>Low gut microbiome richness is associated with dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, and ceramides and other sphingolipids are implicated in the development of diabetes.Determine whether circulating sphingolipids, particularly ceramides, are associated with alterations in the gut microbiome among obese patients with increased diabetes risk.This was a cross-sectional and longitudinal retrospective analysis of a dietary/weight loss intervention. Fasted serum was collected from 49 participants (41 women) and analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS to quantify 45 sphingolipids. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool was performed to profile the gut microbiome.Confirming the link to deteriorated glucose homeostasis, serum ceramides were positively correlated with fasting glucose, but inversely correlated with fasting and OGTT-derived measures of insulin sensitivity and β-cell function. Significant associations with gut dysbiosis were demonstrated, with SM and ceramides being inversely correlated with gene richness. Ceramides with fatty  chain lengths of 20-24 carbons were the most associated with low richness. Diet-induced weight loss, which improved gene richness, decreased most sphingolipids. Thirty-one MGS, mostly corresponding to unidentified bacteria species, were inversely correlated with ceramides, including a number of Bifidobacterium and Methanobrevibacter smithii. Higher ceramide levels were also associated with increased metagenomic modules for lipopolysaccharide synthesis and flagellan synthesis, two pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and decreased enrichment of genes involved in methanogenesis and bile  metabolism.This study identifies an association between gut  richness, ceramides, and diabetes risk in overweight/obese humans, and suggests that the gut  may contribute to dysregulation of lipid metabolism in metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566978>Degradation of Peptide-Bound Maillard Reaction Products in Gastrointestinal Digests of Glyoxal-Glycated Casein by Human Colonic .</a></h2><p>A large portion of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) cannot be absorbed in the upper gut and therefore may be further decomposed and utilized by colonic  (CM). This work reported the stability of UV-absorbent MRPs, fluorescent MRPs and peptide-bound (ε)-(carboxymethyl)-lysine (CML) in high molecular weight (HMW, >10 kDa), medium molecular weight (MMW, 1-10 kDa), and low molecular weight (LMW, <1 kDa) gastrointestinal digests of glyoxal-glycated casein in the presence of CM. Fluorescent MRPs showed high stability, whereas UV-absorbent MRPs may be partially decomposed. A higher depletion rate of CML was found in the LMW fraction (38.7%) than in the MMW (21.7%) and HMW (9.6%) fractions. The 16S rRNA sequencing results revealed both beneficial and detrimental changes in CM composition induced by the glycated fractions. Generation of short-chain and branched-chain fatty  in fermentation solutions with glycated fractions was significantly suppressed compared with that in fermentation solution with unglycated digests. This work revealed the possible interplay between peptide-bound MRPs and CM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552361>In Vitro Fermentation Characteristics for Different Ratios of Soluble to Insoluble Dietary Fiber by Fresh Fecal  from Growing Pigs.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to explore the in vitro fermentation characteristics for different ratios of soluble to insoluble dietary fiber in pig fecal . The fermentation substrates consisted of inulin and a non-starch polysaccharide mixture and were divided into five groups according to different soluble dietary fiber (SDF) to insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) ratios (SDF 25, 50, 75, and 100%). With the increased SDF ratio, the total gas production increased, and the pH in the substrate decreased as the fermentation proceeded. The concentrations of lactic , formic , and acetic  increased in the high SDF ratio group, whereas the concentrations of propionic  and butyric  increased in the low SDF ratio group. The genera , , , and  were enriched in the high SDF ratio group. Correlation analysis indicated that these differential bacteria had the potential to degrade polysaccharides. These results revealed that high SDF ratios could stimulate the proliferation of fibrolytic bacteria, which in turn degrade fibers to produce organic  and monosaccharides. Collectively, these findings add to our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for interaction between SDF and intestinal  and provide new ideas for the rational use of dietary fiber.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616028>Traditional Processed Meat Products Re-designed Towards Inulin-rich Functional Foods Reduce Polyps in Two Colorectal Cancer Animal Models.</a></h2><p>Inulin-rich foods exert a prebiotic effect, as this polysaccharide is able to enhance beneficial colon  populations, giving rise to the in situ production of short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) such as propionic and butyric . These SCFAs are potent preventive agents against colorectal cancer due to their histone deacetylases inhibitory properties, which induce apoptosis in tumor colonocytes. As colorectal cancer is the fourth most common neoplasia in Europe with 28.2 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants, a cost-effective preventive strategy has been tested in this work by redesigning common porcine meat products (chorizo sausages and cooked ham) consumed by a substantial proportion of the population towards potential colorectal cancer preventive functional foods. In order to test the preventive effect of these inulin-rich meat products against colorectal cancer, an animal model (Rattus norvegicus F344) was used, involving two doses of azoxymethane (10 mg/kg) and two treatments with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) during a 20-week assay period. Control feed, control sausages, functional sausages (15.7% inulin), control cooked ham and functional cooked ham (10% inulin) were used to feed the corresponding animal cohorts. Then, the animals were sacrificed and their digestive tract tissues were analyzed. The results showed a statistically significant 49% reduction in the number of colon polyps in the functional meat products cohorts with respect to the control meat products animals, as well as an increase in the cecum weight (an indicator of a diet rich in prebiotic fiber), a 51.8% increase in colon propionate production, a 39.1% increase in colon butyrate concentrations, and a reduction in the number of hyperplastic Peyer's patches. Metagenomics studies also demonstrated colon  differences, revealing a significant increase in Bacteroidetes populations in the functional meat products (mainly due to an increase in Bacteroidaceae and Prevotellaceae families, which include prominent propionate producers), together with a reduction in Firmicutes (especially due to lower Lachnospiraceae populations). However, functional meat products showed a remarkable increase in the anti-inflammatory and fiber-fermentative Blautia genus, which belongs to this Lachnospiraceae family. The functional meat products cohorts also presented a reduction in important pro-inflammatory bacterial populations, such as those of the genus Desulfovibrio and Bilophila. These results were corroborated in a genetic animal model of CRC (F344/NSlc-Apc) that produced similar results. Therefore, processed meat products can be redesigned towards functional prebiotic foods of interest as a cost-effective dietary strategy for preventing colorectal cancer in human populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674054>Long-term impact of tylosin on fecal  and fecal bile  of healthy dogs.</a></h2><p>Tylosin is commonly prescribed to dogs with diarrhea.

However, there are safety concerns associated with the consumption of insects, such as contaminating chemical and biological agents. The possible presence of pathogenic and toxigenic microorganisms is one of the main biological hazards associated with edible insects. This review presents an overview of the  of edible insects, highlighting the potential risks for human health. Detailed information on the  of edible insects from literature published in 2000-2019 is presented. These data show complex ecosystems, with marked variations in microbial load and diversity, among edible insects as well as stable and species-specific  for some of the most popular edible insect species, such as mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor) and grasshoppers (Locusta migratoria). Raw edible insects generally contain high numbers of mesophilic aerobes, bacterial endospores or spore-forming bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, lactic  bacteria, psychrotrophic aerobes, and fungi, and potentially harmful species (i.e. pathogenic, mycotoxigenic, and spoilage microbes) may be present. Several studies have focused on reducing the microbial contamination of edible insects by applying treatments such as starvation, rinsing, thermal treatments, chilling, drying, fermentation, and marination, both alone and, sometimes, in combination. Although these studies show that various heat treatments were the most efficient methods for reducing microbial numbers, they also highlight the need for species-specific mitigation strategies. The feasibility of using edible insects as ingredients in the food industry in the development of innovative insect-based products has been explored; although, in some cases, the presence of spore-forming bacteria and other food-borne pathogens is a concern. Recent studies have shown that a risk assessment of edible insects should also include an evaluation of the incidence of antibiotic-resistance (AR) genes and antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in the production chain. Finally, as proposed in the literature, microbial hazards should be limited through the implementation of good hygienic practices during rearing, handling, processing, and storage, as well as the implementation of an appropriate HACCP system for edible insect supply chains. Another issue frequently reported in the literature is the need for a legislative framework for edible insect production, commercialisation, and trading, as well as the need for microbiological criteria specifically tailored for edible insects. Microbiological criteria like those already been established for the food safety and hygiene (e.g. those in the European Union food law) of different food categories (e.g. ready-to-eat products) could be applied to edible insect-based products.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Nutritional constituents strongly influence composition and functional properties of the intestinal microbial communities. Here, we report that omission of a single essential amino  - tryptophan - from the diet abrogates CNS autoimmunity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Dietary tryptophan restriction results in impaired encephalitogenic T cell responses and is accompanied by a mild intestinal inflammatory response and a profound phenotypic shift of gut . Protective effects of dietary tryptophan restriction are abrogated in germ-free mice, but are independent of canonical host sensors of intracellular tryptophan metabolites. We conclude that dietary tryptophan restriction alters metabolic properties of gut , which in turn have an impact on encephalitogenic T cell responses. This link between gut , dietary tryptophan and adaptive immunity may help to develop therapeutic strategies for protection from autoimmune neuroinflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595010>Metabolic output defines Escherichia coli as a health-promoting microbe against intestinal Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</a></h2><p>Gut  acts as a barrier against intestinal pathogens, but species-specific protection of the host from infection remains relatively unexplored. Although lactobacilli and bifidobacteria produce beneficial lactic and short-chain fatty  in the mammalian gut, the significance of intestinal Escherichia coli producing these  is debatable. Taking a Koch's postulates approach in reverse, we define Escherichia coli as health-promoting for naturally colonizing the gut of healthy mice and protecting them against intestinal colonization and concomitant mortality by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Reintroduction of faecal bacteria and E. coli in antibiotic-treated mice establishes a high titre of E. coli in the host intestine and increases defence against P. aeruginosa colonization and mortality. Strikingly, high sugar concentration favours E. coli fermentation to lactic and acetic  and inhibits P. aeruginosa growth and virulence in aerobic cultures and in a model of aerobic metabolism in flies, while dietary vegetable fats - not carbohydrates or proteins - favour E. coli fermentation and protect the host in the anaerobic mouse gut. Thus E. coli metabolic output is an important indicator of resistance to infection. Our work may also suggest that the lack of antimicrobial bacterial metabolites in mammalian lungs and wounds allows P. aeruginosa to be a formidable microbe at these sites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566173>Partially defatted olive cake in finishing pig diets: implications on performance, faecal , carcass quality, slurry composition and gas emission.</a></h2><p>One of the key factors to improve swine production sustainability is the use of agro-industrial by-products in feeds, such as olive by-products. However, it is necessary to assess its effects on the overall production process, including the animal and the environment. With this aim, an experiment was conducted to determine the effects of including a partially defatted olive cake (PDOC) in pig diets on growth performance, faecal , carcass quality and gas emission from the slurry. Two finishing diets were formulated, a control (C) diet and a diet with PDOC included at 120 g/kg. Eighty finishing male pigs Duroc-Danbred × (Landrace × Large White) of 60.4 ± 7.00 kg BW were divided between these two treatments. During the finishing period (60 to 110 kg BW, 55 days) average daily gain, average daily feed intake and feed conversion ratio were recorded. Faecal samples from the rectum of 16 animals per treatment were incubated for bacteria enumeration. At the end of finishing period, backfat thickness and loin depth (LD) were measured. Animals were slaughtered to obtain carcass weight and carcass composition parameters, and subcutaneous fat was sampled to analyse the fatty  (FA) profile. In addition greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions were measured during pig slurry storage using the methodology of dynamic flux chambers. An initial slurry characterisation and biochemical methane potential (B0) were also determined. No significant differences between treatments were found in performance, carcass quality and microbial counts with the exception of LD, which was lower in PDOC compared with C animals (45.5 v. 47.5 mm, SEM: 0.62; P = 0.020). The FA profile of the subcutaneous fat did not differ between treatments, but the monounsaturated FA (MUFA) concentration was higher and the polyunsaturated FA was lower in the animals fed PDOC (50.9 v. 48.3, SEM: 0.48, P < 0.001; 17.6 v. 19.3, SEM: 0.30, P < 0.001 in mg/100 g of Total FA, for PDOC and C animals, respectively). The initial pig slurry characterisation only showed differences in ADF concentration that was higher (P < 0.05) in the slurry from PDOC treatment. Regarding gas emission, slurries from both treatments emitted similar amounts of ammonia (NH3), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as B0 values. The results obtained suggest that PDOC may be included in balanced pig diets at rates of up to 120 g/kg without negative effects on performance, carcass quality, gut microflora and slurry gas emission, while improving the MUFA concentration of subcutaneous fat.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571427>Faecal  and functional capacity associated with weaning weight in meat rabbits.</a></h2><p>Weaning weight is an important economic trait in the meat rabbit industry. Evidence has linked the gut  to health and production performance in rabbits. However, the effect of gut  on meat rabbit weaning weight remains unclear. In this study, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis of 135 faecal samples from commercial Ira rabbits. We detected 50 OTUs significantly associated with weaning weight. OTUs that showed positive associations with weaning weight were mostly members of the family Ruminococcaceae which are important in degrading dietary fibres and producing butyrate. On the contrary, OTUs annotated to genera Blautia, Lachnoclostridium and Butyricicoccus correlated with fat deposition were negatively associated with weaning weight. Predicted functional capacity analysis revealed that 91 KOs and 26 KEGG pathways exhibited potential correlations with weaning weight. We found that gut  involved in the metabolism of amino , butanoate, energy and monosaccharides affected weaning weight. Additionally, cross-validation analysis indicated that 16.16% of the variation in weaning weight was explained by the gut microbiome. Our findings provide important information to improve weaning weight of meat rabbits by modulating their gut microbiome.© 2019 The Authors.

We investigated if the dietary minerals interact with the gut  to alter circulating lipid profiles, implicated in CVD and metabolic syndrome.Plasma samples from Wistar rats fed a control or HNaLK diet with or without antibiotic treatment (n = 7 each, a total of 28) were subjected to lipidomics analysis. Lipidomic data were then analyzed using various statistical and bioinformatics tools, which detected numerous lipid species altered by the treatments, and consistently demonstrated interactions between the gut  and the HNaLK diet in altering circulating lipids, mainly triglycerides (TGs). We identified two distinct TG groups, differentially regulated by antibiotic treatment. One group (cluster 1), representing the majority of TG species detected, was downregulated, whereas the other group (cluster 2) was upregulated by antibiotic treatment. Interestingly, cluster 2 TGs were also regulated by the diet. Cluster 2 TGs exhibited greater carbon-chain length and double-bond content and included TGs composed of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty , previously associated with reduced diabetes risk.The HNaLK diet interacts with gut bacteria to alter plasma lipid profiles, which may be related to its health effects.

Pathogenic filamentous oomycetes of the genus  comprises more than 150 recognized species and cause highly destructive soil-borne diseases in deciduous trees crops worldwide. Moreover, the treatment of soil  with amino  is an alternative strategy to achieve desirable effects even against phytopathogenic oomycetes. In our study, samples from rhizosphere soil were collected either from naturally -infected trees, from completely asymptomatic ones, or from trees as above subjected also to treatments with amino  (Amino16®) under different fertilization regimes. The interactions of bacterial communities with plant pathogenic oomycetes are crucial to determine the course of infection and the pathogenicity encompassing various functional contexts like biofilm formation. Thus, for deciphering the structure and diversity of these soil bacterial communities, we applied a 16S rRNA Illumina sequencing approach targeting the V3-V4 gene region.

We compared the intestinal fermentative capability of stunted and nonstunted ('healthy') children in southern India using two types of RS: high amylose maize starch (HAMS) and acetylated HAMS (HAMSA). Twenty children (10 stunted and 10 healthy) aged 2 to 5 years were fed biscuits containing HAMS (10 g/day) for two weeks followed by a 2-week washout and then HAMSA biscuits (10 g/day) for 2 weeks. Fecal samples were collected at 3-4 day intervals and pH and SCFA analyzed. At entry, stunted children had lower SCFA concentrations compared to healthy children. Both types of RS led to a significant decrease in fecal pH and increase in fecal acetate and propionate in both healthy and stunted children. However, while HAMS increased fecal butyrate in both groups of children, HAMSA increased butyrate in healthy but not stunted children. Furthermore, healthy children showed a significantly greater increase than stunted children in both acetate and butyrate when fed either RS. No adverse effects were reported with either RS. Stunted children have impaired capacity to ferment certain types of RS which has implications for choice of RS in formulations aimed at improving microbial function in stunted children.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663129>-dependent and -independent effects of dietary fiber on human health.</a></h2><p>Dietary fiber, such as indigestible oligo- and polysaccharides, occurs in many foods and has gained considerable interest related to its beneficial effects on host health and specific diseases. Dietary fiber is neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine and modulates the composition of the gut . New evidence indicates that dietary fiber also directly interacts with the epithelium and immune cells throughout the gastrointestinal tract by -independent effects. This review provides a focused overview of how dietary fiber improve human health and how these reported health benefits are connected to molecular pathways, in (1) a -independent manner, via interaction with specific surface receptors on epithelial and immune cells regulating intestinal barrier and immune function, (2) a -dependent manner via maintaining intestinal homeostasis by promoting beneficial microbes, including Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, limiting the growth, adhesion and cytotoxicity of pathogenic microbes, as well as stimulating fiber-derived microbial short-chain fatty  production.This article is protected by copyright.

In the study, the treatment of HLP on improving hyperlipidemia in rats was explored. Oral administration of HLP at 100 or 200 mg/kg body weight effectively alleviated serum lipid levels and liver histological abnormalities in high-fat-diet rats. HLP regulated abnormal mRNA, lipogenesis-related hormones and inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and interleukin-12) levels. HLP improved the ability of gut  to produce short-chain fatty  (SCFAs). SCFAs have been found to ameliorate liver lesions.

Substantial changes in host hormones, metabolism, and immunity around the parturition period may be accompanied by alterations in the gut microbiome. However, to our knowledge, changes in the gut microbiome and their contribution to the shifts in host metabolism around parturition have not been investigated in pigs. Furthermore, pigs are an ideal biomedical model for studying the interactions of the gut  with host metabolism, due to the ease of controlling feeding conditions. Here we report dramatic remodeling of the gut  and the potential functional capacity during the late stages of pregnancy (5 days before parturition, LP) to postpartum (within 6 h after delivery, PO) in both experimental and validated populations of sows ( = 107). The richness of bacteria in the gut of both pregnant and delivery sows significantly decreased, whilst the β-diversity dramatically expanded. The ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes, and the relative abundance of Prevotella significantly decreased, whilst the relative abundance of the predominant genus  significantly increased from LP to PO state. The predicted functional capacities of the gut microbiome related to amino  metabolism, the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, and glycan biosynthesis were significantly decreased from LP to PO state. However, the abundance of the functional capacities associated with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were increased. Consistent with these changes, serum metabolites enriched at the LP stage were associated with the metabolism of amino  and vitamins. In contrast, metabolites enriched at the PO stage were related to lipid metabolism. We further identified that the richness and β-diversity of the gut  and the abundance of  accounted for shifts in the levels of bile  metabolites associated with lipid metabolism. The results suggest that host- interactions during the perinatal period impact host metabolism. These benefit the lactation of sows by providing energy from lipid metabolism for milk production.Copyright © 2019 Huang, Gao, Zhao, He, Ke, Wu, Zhou, Fu, Yang, Chen and Huang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555219>Gut Dysfunction and Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as one of the leading liver diseases worldwide. NAFLD is characterized by hepatic steatosis and may progress to an inflammatory condition termed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. It became evident in the last years that NAFLD pathophysiology is complex and involves diverse immunological and metabolic pathways. An association between intestinal signals (e.g., derived from the gut ) and the development of obesity and its metabolic consequences such as NAFLD are increasingly recognized. Pre-clinical studies have shown that germ-free mice are protected against obesity and hepatic steatosis. Several human studies from the past years have demonstrated that NAFLD contains a disease-specific gut microbiome signature. Controlled studies propose that certain bacteria with rather pro-inflammatory features such as Proteobacteria or  are dominantly present in these patients. In contrast, rather protective bacteria such as  are decreased in NAFLD patients. Furthermore, various bacterial metabolites and -generated secondary bile  are involved in NAFLD-associated metabolic dysfunction. Although these findings are exciting, research currently lack evidence that interference at the level of the gut microbiome is beneficial for these diseases. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to advance this aspect of NAFLD research and to support the notion that the intestinal  is indeed of major relevance in this disorder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652531>The Role of Glutamine in the Complex Interaction between Gut  and Health: A Narrative Review.</a></h2><p>The scientific literature has demonstrated that glutamine is one of the main beneficial amino .

The potential applications of glutamine on gut  include, but are not limited to, the management of obesity, bacterial translocation and community, cytokines profiles, and the management of side effects during post-chemotherapy and constipation periods. Further studies and reviews are needed regarding the effects of glutamine supplementation on other conditions in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664519>Dietary intervention using (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a fungus-derived soluble prebiotic ameliorates high-fat diet-induced metabolic distress and alters beneficially the gut  in mice model.</a></h2><p>Western diet, rich in carbohydrates and fat, is said to be a major factor underlying metabolic syndrome. Interventions with prebiotics, the key modulators of the gut , have paramount impact on host-associated metabolic disorders. Herein, we investigated the effect of fungus-derived (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a highly soluble dietary fiber, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic distress.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with different diet groups (n = 11): control diet, HFD, 3 g/kg or 5 g/kg of β-glucan-incorporated HFD. At the end of experimental study period (12th week), body weight, feces weight and fecal moisture content were observed. Further, colonic motility was measured using activated charcoal meal study. Proteins extracted from liver and intestine tissues were subjected to western blot technique. Paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned for histochemical [Periodic -Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB) staining] analysis. Fecal  analysis was performed using MOTHUR bioinformatic software.β-glucan consumption exhibited anti-obesity property in mice groups fed with HFD. In addition, β-glucan ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic stress, colonic motility and intestinal atrophy (reduction in colon length, goblet cells, and mucosal layer thickness). Further, β-glucan incorporation shifted bacterial community by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaerostipes, Coprobacillus, and Roseburia and decreasing reportedly obesity-associated bacteria such as Parabacteroides and Lactococcus.Altogether, the outcomes of this present pre-clinical animal study show β-glucan to be a promising therapeutic candidate in the treatment of HFD-induced metabolic distress. Further comprehensive research has to be conducted to brace its clinical relevance, reproducibility and efficacy for aiding human health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576748>Role of the Gut  and Their Metabolites in Modulating the Cholesterol-Lowering Effects of Citrus Pectin Oligosaccharides in C57BL/6 Mice.</a></h2><p>We investigated the regulatory effects of citrus pectin oligosaccharides (POS) from an innovative, chemically controllable degradation process on cholesterol metabolism and the gut microbial composition. The modulatory role of the intestinal flora was explored. Four-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a standard diet; a high-fat (HF) diet; or a HF diet with 0.15, 0.45, and 0.9 g/kg body weight POS for 30 days. POS reduced serum total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in a dose-dependent manner. The relative abundances of specific bacterial groups in the feces and the concentrations of their metabolites were higher in the POS groups. There were significant correlations among , , and  and short-chain fatty , as well as among serum TC, LDL-C, fecal bile , and liver cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. These findings indicate that the prepared POS exhibited hypocholesterolemic effects and that the potential regulatory mechanisms of citrus POS on cholesterol metabolism are modulated by specific bacterial groups together with their metabolites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640295>Effects of Olive and Pomegranate By-Products on Human : A Study Using the SHIME in Vitro Simulator.</a></h2><p>Two by-products containing phenols and polysaccharides, a "pâté" (OP) from the extra virgin olive oil milling process and a decoction of pomegranate mesocarp (PM), were investigated for their effects on human  using the SHIME system. The ability of these products to modulate the microbial community was studied simulating a daily intake for nine days. Microbial functionality, investigated in terms of short chain fatty  (SCFA) and NH, was stable during the treatment. A significant increase in  and  at nine days was induced by OP mainly in the proximal tract. Polyphenol metabolism indicated the formation of tyrosol from OP mainly in the distal tract, while urolithins C and A were produced from PM, identifying the human donor as a metabotype A. The results confirm the SHIME system as a suitable in vitro tool to preliminarily investigate interactions between complex botanicals and human  before undertaking more challenging human studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672964>Theabrownin from Pu-erh tea attenuates hypercholesterolemia via modulation of gut  and bile  metabolism.</a></h2><p>Pu-erh tea displays cholesterol-lowering properties, but the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. Theabrownin is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea. Here, we show that theabrownin alters the gut  in mice and humans, predominantly suppressing microbes associated with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Theabrownin increases the levels of ileal conjugated bile  (BAs) which, in turn, inhibit the intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling pathway, resulting in increased hepatic production and fecal excretion of BAs, reduced hepatic cholesterol, and decreased lipogenesis. The inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling is accompanied by increased gene expression of enzymes in the alternative BA synthetic pathway, production of hepatic chenodeoxycholic , activation of hepatic FXR, and hepatic lipolysis. Our results shed light into the mechanisms behind the cholesterol- and lipid-lowering effects of Pu-erh tea, and suggest that decreased intestinal BSH microbes and/or decreased FXR-FGF15 signaling may be potential anti-hypercholesterolemia and anti-hyperlipidemia therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31568990>Ferulic  increases intestinal Lactobacillus and improves cardiac function in TAC mice.</a></h2><p>Ferulic , a main ingredient of Ligusticum, exhibits anti-oxidant and anti-inflammation effects in heart diseases. Some studies indicate that gut microbiome is associated with the generation of ferulic . Whether the beneficial effect of ferulic is raised by the alteration of gut  is still unknown. This study examined the effect of sodium ferulate on gut microbiome and cardiac function in TAC mice. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay verified that ferulic  has low toxicity in vitro and that ferulic  inhibited the up-regulation of β-MHC and ANP induced by Angiotensin II. In addition, daily supplement of 50 mg/kg sodium ferulate improved the ejection fraction and changed the gut  composition of TAC mice. Relative abundance of Lactobacillus and Parabacteroides are increased in TAC mice gavaged with sodium ferulate. In addition, Lactobacillus is negatively correlated with HW/BW and LW/BW ratio. These results suggest that the beneficial effect of ferulic in TAC mice is probably through the regulation of gut .Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

There are many predisposing factors, for example, genetic predisposition, smoking, or a diet rich in red, processed meat and poor in vegetables and fruits. Probiotics may be helpful in the prevention of cancer and may provide support during treatment. The main aim of this study is to characterize the potential mechanisms of action of probiotics, in particular the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. Probiotics' potential mechanisms of action are, for example, modification of intestinal , improvement of colonic physicochemical conditions, production of anticancerogenic and antioxidant metabolites against carcinogenesis, a decrease in intestinal inflammation, and the production of harmful enzymes. The prevention of colorectal cancer is associated with favorable quantitative and qualitative changes in the intestinal , as well as changes in metabolic activity and in the physicochemical conditions of the intestine. In addition, it is worth noting that the effect depends on the bacterial strain, as well as on the dose administered.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591306>In vitro Fermentation of Polysaccharides from  and the Evaluation of Antioxidant Activity and Production of Short Chain Fatty .</a></h2><p>Soluble or fermentable fibre has prebiotic effects that can be used in the food industry to modify the composition of  species to benefit human health. Prebiotics mostly target Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains, among others, which can fight against chronic diseases since colonic fermentation produces short chain fatty  (SCFAs). The present work studied the changes produced in the fibre and polyphenolic compounds during in vitro digestion of gel (AV) and a polysaccharide extract (AP) from , after which, these fractions were subjected to in vitro colonic fermentation to evaluate the changes in antioxidant capacity and SCFAs production during the fermentation. The results showed that the phenolic compounds increased during digestion, but were reduced in fermentation, as a consequence, the antioxidant activity increased significantly in AV and AP after the digestion. On the other hand, during in vitro colon fermentation, the unfermented fibre of AV and AP responded as lactulose and the total volume of gas produced, which indicates the possible use of  and polysaccharide extract as prebiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615057>Differential Effects of Typical Korean Versus American-Style Diets on Gut Microbial Composition and Metabolic Profile in Healthy Overweight Koreans: A Randomized Crossover Trial.</a></h2><p>The Westernized diet has been associated with the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, whereas a Korean diet has been reported to exert beneficial effects on health in several studies. However, the effects of Western and Korean diets on the gut microbiome and host metabolome are unclear. To examine the diet-specific effects on microbiome and metabolome, we conducted a randomized crossover clinical trial of typical Korean diet (TKD), typical American diet (TAD), and recommended American diet (RAD). The trial involved a 4-week consumption of an experimental diet followed by a 2-week interval before diet crossover. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis identified 16, 10, and 14 differential bacteria genera specific to TKD, RAD, and TAD, respectively. The Firmucutes-Bacteroidetes ratio was increased by TKD. Nuclear magnetic resonance metabolome profiling revealed that TKD enriched branched chain amino  metabolism, whereas ketone body metabolism was evident in RAD and TAD. Microbiome and metabolome responses to the experimental diets varied with individual enterotypes. These findings provide evidence that the gut microbiome and host metabolome rapidly respond to different cultural diets. The findings will inform clarification of the diet-related communication networks of the gut microbiome and host metabolome in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634462>Time-dependent alteration to the tight junction structure of distal intestinal epithelia in type 2 prediabetic mice.</a></h2><p>High-fat diet (HFD) intake has been associated with changes in intestinal  composition, increased intestinal permeability, and onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this work was twofold: 1) to investigate the structural and functional alterations of the tight junction (TJ)-mediated intestinal epithelial barrier of ileum and colon, that concentrate most of the , after exposure to a HFD for 15, 30 and 60 days, and 2) to assess the effect of in vitro exposure to free fatty  (FFAs), one of the components of HFD, on paracellular barrier of colon-derived Caco-2 cells.HFD exposure induced progressive metabolic changes in male mice that culminated in prediabetes after 60d. Morphological analysis of ileum and colon mucosa showed no signs of epithelial rupture or local inflammation but changes in the junctional content/distribution and/or cellular content of TJ-associated proteins (claudins-1, -2, -3, and occludin) in intestinal epithelia were seen mainly after a prediabetes state has been established. This impairment in TJ structure was not associated with significant changes in intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran. Exposure of Caco-2 monolayers to palmitic or linoleic  seems to induce a reinforcement of TJ structure while treatment with oleic  had a more diverse effect on TJ protein distribution.TJ structure in distal intestinal epithelia can be specifically impaired by HFD intake at early stage of T2DM, but not by FFAs in vitro. Since the TJ change in ileum/colon was marginal, probably it does not contribute to the disease onset.Copyright © 2019.

Five samples of commercial spelt flour were subjected to spontaneous fermentation to obtain a type I sourdough. A total of 186 LAB and 174 yeast isolates were selected at different refreshment steps and subjected to further analyses. Within LAB, coccal isolates constituted 78.5% of the total LAB, with the dominance of Pediococcus pentosaceus. Although documented before as a component, this is the first report of a spelt sourdough fermentation dominated by this homofermentative LAB, characterized by a high acidification rate, ability to utilize a wide range of carbon sources and to grow in high osmolarity conditions. Yeast communities resulted in four dominant species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Wickerhamomyces anomalus, Pichia fermentans and Clavispora lusitaniae. This study highlights for the first time the biodiversity and dynamics of yeast communities involved in sourdough fermentation of spelt. Compared to commercial baker's yeast, autochthonous W. anomalus, P. fermentans and S. cerevisiae isolates show a good performance, and their use could be an advantage for their acquired adaptation to the environment, providing stability to the fermentation process.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672153>Effect of Enterococcus faecalis 2001 on colitis and depressive-like behavior in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice: involvement of the brain-gut axis.</a></h2><p>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including those with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, have higher rates of psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety; however, the mechanism of psychiatric disorder development remains unclear. Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut  is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic  bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus.

The present study identified 60 volatile compounds, 23 amino , and seven organic  during the traditional brewing of Monascus vinegar. Acetic , alanine, alcohols, esters, lactic , and valine were the predominant metabolic compounds found during the fermentation process. Komagataeibacter medellinensis, Lactobacillus acetotolerans, Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, Sterigmatomyces halophilus, and Yarrowia lipolytica were the dominant microorganisms during the traditional brewing of Monascus vinegar. Furthermore, based on Spearman's correlation analysis, K. medellinensis showed a positive correlation with acetic , acetoin, benzaldehyde, phenethyl acetate, 4-ethylphenol, proline, threonine, and isoleucine. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was positively associated with the production of acetoin, benzeneacetaldehyde, 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine, proline, threonine, and isoleucine. Bacillus velezensis and Yarrowia lipolytica were positively correlated with esters and alcohols, implying that these microorganisms might make a significant contribution to the flavor of vinegar. These findings demonstrated that some microorganisms may play important roles in improving the aromatic quality of Monascus vinegar.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This excessive bacterial biomass, in turn, disrupts host physiology in a myriad of ways, leading to gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal symptoms and complications. SIBO is a common cause of non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms in children, such as chronic abdominal pain, abdominal distention, diarrhoea, and flatulence, amongst others. In addition, it has recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of stunting, a disease that affects millions of children worldwide. Risk factors such as -suppressive therapies, alterations in gastrointestinal motility and anatomy, as well as impoverished conditions, have been shown to predispose children to SIBO. SIBO can be diagnosed via culture-dependant or culture-independent approaches. SIBO's epidemiology is limited due to the lack of uniformity and consensus of its diagnostic criteria, as well as the paucity of literature available. Antibiotics remain the first-line treatment option for SIBO, although emerging modalities such as probiotics and diet manipulation could also have a role. Herein, we present a state-of-the-art-review which aims to comprehensively outline the most current information on SIBO in children, with particular emphasis on the gut .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573550>The gut microbiome and metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors that, if left untreated, will often progress to greater metabolic defects such as type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. While these risk factors have been established for over 40 years, the definition of MetS warrants reconsideration in light of the substantial data that have emerged from studies of the gut microbiome. In this Review we present the existing recent literature that supports the gut microbiome's potential influence on the various risk factors of MetS. The interplay of the intestinal  with host metabolism has been shown to be mediated by a myriad of factors, including a defective gut barrier, bile  metabolism, antibiotic use, and the pleiotropic effects of microbially produced metabolites.

We hypothesized that fecal samples representing the gut  of rainbow trout could be associated with differential growth rates observed in fish breeding programs. If true, harnessing the functionality of this  can improve the profitability of aquaculture. The first objective of this study was to test this hypothesis if gut  is associated with fish growth rate (body weight). Four full-sibling families were stocked in the same tank and fed an identical diet. Two fast-growing and two slow-growing fish were selected from each family for 16S rRNA  profiling.  diversity varies with different DNA extraction methods. The second objective of this study was to compare the effects of five commonly used DNA extraction methods on the  profiling and to determine the most appropriate extraction method for this study. These methods were Promega-Maxwell, Phenol-chloroform, MO-BIO, Qiagen-Blood/Tissue, and Qiagen-Stool. Methods were compared according to DNA integrity, cost, feasibility and inter-sample variation based on non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (nMDS) clusters.Differences in DNA extraction methods resulted in significant variation in the identification of bacteria that compose the gut . Promega-Maxwell had the lowest inter-sample variation and was therefore used for the subsequent analyses. Beta diversity of the bacterial communities showed significant variation between breeding families but not between the fast- and slow-growing fish. However, an indicator analysis determined that cellulose, amylose degrading and amino  fermenting bacteria (Clostridium, Leptotrichia, and Peptostreptococcus) are indicator taxa of the fast-growing fish. In contrary, pathogenic bacteria (Corynebacterium and Paeniclostridium) were identified as indicator taxa for the slow-growing fish.DNA extraction methodology should be carefully considered for accurate profiling of the gut . Although the  was not significantly different between the fast- and slow-growing fish groups, some bacterial taxa with functional implications were indicative of fish growth rate. Further studies are warranted to explore how bacteria are transmitted and potential usage of the indicator bacteria of fast-growing fish for development of probiotics that may improve fish health and growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31568824>Nutrition and immunology in mental health: Precision medicine and integrative approaches to address unmet clinical needs in psychiatric treatments.</a></h2><p>The 'monoamine hypothesis' is insufficient in approaching the aetiology of psychiatric disorders or in developing novel therapies. Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammatory regulation plays an important role in pathophysiology and therapeutic mechanism across the major psychiatric disorders. "Inflammation theory" might not be the full answer for the big picture of mental disorders, but it might explain high occurrence of somatic symptoms and comorbidity of physical illness in certain subtypes of the heterogeneous groups. Due to the complexity of clinical manifestations and bio-psycho-social etiology, each single treatment shows only small effectiveness with limited effect sizes when compared with placebo. Unfortunately, clinicians are still struggling with trial-and-error practice without any reliable clinical or biological markers to predict therapeutic responses. Therefore, it is important to open up our minds to integrative approaches such dietary modification and nutraceutical prescription. In this special issue, we included 15 papers discussing the role of nutrition (blueberries, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty , melatonergic agonist, S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine, Cannabidiol and Kratom) in the context of immunoregulation across different psychiatric disorders from depression, bipolar disorders, and schizophrenia to alcohol-induced dementia and anorexia nervosa. Moreover, we also included research in perinatal depression that highlight the role of estradiol and the component of breast milk and the association with the neurodevelopment of the offspring. In addition, several articles focused on the role of  in mental health and pain as recent research has pointed to the gut-brain axis as a main regulator of brain, behaviour and immunity. Lastly, inflammatory mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders including alcohol induced dementia and anorexia nervosa are also highlighted in the special issue.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Prophylactic bio-interventions mainly probiotics offer an alternate approach towards reducing or delaying its progression. Therefore, the present study was designed wherein a robust protocol for the isolation, characterization, and identification of indigenous probiotics having antigenotoxic and anticancerous activity was followed along with their prophylactic potential assessment in early experimental colorectal carcinogenesis. Among forty-six isolated lactic  bacterial strains, only three were selected on the basis of antigenotoxicity against N,N-Dimethyl dihydrazine dihydrochloride and 4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide and probiotic attributes. All three selected probiotic strains exhibited anticancerous potential as is evident by the reduced Aberrant Crypt Foci, reduced fecal pH, enhanced fecal lactic  bacteria and altered fecal enzymes (β-glucuronidase, nitroreductase, β-glucosidase) that modulated gut  and microenvironment resulting into restored histoarchitecture of the colon.

While many strategies have been proposed to mitigate Bd outbreaks, few have been successful. In recent years, the use of probiotic formulations that protect an amphibian host by killing or inhibiting Bd have shown promise as an effective chytridiomycosis control strategy. The North American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) is a common carrier of Bd and harbours a diverse skin  that includes lactic  bacteria (LAB), a microbial group containing species classified as safe and conferring host benefits. We investigated beneficial/probiotic properties: anti-Bd activity, and adhesion and colonisation characteristics (hydrophobicity, biofilm formation and exopolysaccharide-EPS production) in two confirmed LAB (cLAB-Enterococcus gallinarum CRL 1826, Lactococcus garvieae CRL 1828) and 60 presumptive LAB (pLAB) [together named as LABs] isolated from bullfrog skin.We challenged LABs against eight genetically diverse Bd isolates and found that 32% of the LABs inhibited at least one Bd isolate with varying rates of inhibition. Thus, we established a score of sensitivity from highest (BdGPL AVS7) to lowest (BdGPL C2A) for the studied Bd isolates. We further reveal key factors underlying host adhesion and colonisation of LABs. Specifically, 90.3% of LABs exhibited hydrophilic properties that may promote adhesion to the cutaneous mucus, with the remaining isolates (9.7%) being hydrophobic in nature with a surface polarity compatible with colonisation of acidic, basic or both substrate types. We also found that 59.7% of LABs showed EPS synthesis and 66.1% produced biofilm at different levels: 21% weak, 29% moderate, and 16.1% strong. Together all these properties enhance colonisation of the host surface (mucus or epithelial cells) and may confer protective benefits against Bd through competitive exclusion. Correspondence analysis indicated that biofilm synthesis was LABs specific with high aggregating bacteria correlating with strong biofilm producers, and EPS producers being correlated to negative biofilm producing LABs. We performed Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis and demonstrated a higher degree of genetic diversity among rod-shaped pLAB than cocci. Based on the LAB genetic analysis and specific probiotic selection criteria that involve beneficial properties, we sequenced 16 pLAB which were identified as Pediococcus pentosaceus, Enterococcus thailandicus, Lactobacillus pentosus/L. plantarum, L. brevis, and L. curvatus. Compatibility assays performed with cLAB and the 16 species described above indicate that all tested LAB can be included in a mixed probiotic formula. Based on our analyses, we suggest that E. gallinarum CRL 1826, L. garvieae CRL 1828, and P. pentosaceus 15 and 18B represent optimal probiotic candidates for Bd control and mitigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614770>The Effects and Mechanisms of Cyanidin-3-Glucoside and Its Phenolic Metabolites in Maintaining Intestinal Integrity.</a></h2><p>Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is a well-known natural anthocyanin and possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship among layer breed, microbial structure and odor production.Thirty Hy-Line Gray and thirty Lohmann Pink laying hens were used in this study to determine the impact of cecal microbial structure on odor production of laying hens. The hens were managed under the same husbandry and dietary regimes. Results of in vivo experiments showed a lower hydrogen sulfide (HS) production from Hy-Line hens and a lower concentration of soluble sulfide (S) but a higher concentration of butyrate in the cecal content of the Hy-Line hens compared to Lohmann Pink hens (P < 0.05), which was consistent with the in vitro experiments (P < 0.05). However, ammonia (NH) production was not different between genotypes (P > 0.05). Significant microbial structural differences existed between the two breed groups. The relative abundance of some butyrate producers (including Butyricicoccus, Butyricimonas and Roseburia) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (including Mailhella and Lawsonia) were found to be significantly correlated with odor production and were shown to be different in the 16S rRNA and PCR data between two breed groups. Furthermore, some bacterial metabolism pathways associated with energy extraction and carbohydrate utilization (oxidative phosphorylation, pyruvate metabolism, energy metabolism, two component system and secretion system) were overrepresented in the Hy-Line hens, while several amino  metabolism-associated pathways (amino  related enzymes, arginine and proline metabolism, and alanine-aspartate and glutamate metabolism) were more prevalent in the Lohmann hens.The results of this study suggest that genotype of laying hens influence cecal , which in turn modulates their odor production.

We analyzed whether vitamin D deficiency alters rat gut . Male Wistar rats were fed a standard or a vitamin D-free diet for seven weeks. The microbiome composition was determined in fecal samples by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The vitamin D-free diet produced mild changes on α- diversity but no effect on β-diversity in the global microbiome.

The control treatment (CON) was based on a diet including 50% of grass silage, whereas the experimental treatment (TAN) included grass silage sprayed with OTE (26 g/kg DM) just before baling. Milk yield (on average 24 kg fat protein corrected milk per day) was not affected, but both milk and rumen fatty  profiles were impacted by OTE. Nitrogen intake (415 g N per cow per day) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE; 0.25 on average) were not affected, but a shift from urine (-8% of N intake relatively to control, P = 0.06) to faecal N (+5%; P = 0.004) was observed with the TAN diet (P ≤ 0.05). Nitrogen apparent digestibility was thus reduced for TAN (-3%; P ≤ 0.05). The effect of OTE on ruminal and milk FA profiles suggests an impact on rumen . Nitrogen isotopic discrimination between animal proteins and diet (Δ15N) was evaluated as a proxy for NUE. While no differences in NUE were observed across diets, a lower Δ15N of plasma proteins was found when comparing TAN v. CON diets. This finding supports the concept that Δ15N would mainly sign the N partitioning at the metabolic level rather than the overall NUE, with the latter also being impacted by digestive processes. Our results agree with a N shift from urine to faeces, and this strategy can thus be adopted to decrease the environmental impact of ruminant protein feeding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641822>HS-SPME-GC-MS approach for the analysis of volatile salivary metabolites and application in a case study for the indirect assessment of gut .</a></h2><p>In this work, a straightforward analytical approach based on headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was developed for the analysis of salivary volatile organic compounds without any prior derivatization step. With a sample volume of 500 μL, optimal conditions were achieved by allowing the sample to equilibrate for 10 min at 50 °C and then extracting the samples for 10 min at the same temperature, using a carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane fibre. The method allowed the simultaneous identification and quantification of 20 compounds in sample headspace, including short-chain fatty  and their derivatives which are commonly analysed after analyte derivatization. The proof of applicability of the methodology was performed with a case study regarding the analysis of the dynamics of volatile metabolites in saliva of a single subject undergoing 5-day treatment with rifaximin antibiotic. Non-stimulated saliva samples were collected over 3 weeks from a nominally healthy volunteer before, during, and after antibiotic treatment. The variations of some metabolites, known to be produced by the  and by bacteria that are susceptible to antibiotics, suggest that the study of the dynamics of salivary metabolites can be an excellent indirect method for analysing the gut . This approach is novel from an analytical standpoint, and it encourages further studies combining saliva metabolite profiles and gut  dynamics.

Total , salinity and lactic  content in salted group were significantly higher than those in salt-free group, whereas pH value as well as the contents of acetic , sucrose, glucose and fructose showed no significant difference between the two groups. 20 phyla, 339 genera and 203 species were observed in all yancai samples. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the major phyla. Lactobacillus was the predominant genus in both the salted and the salt-free samples, whereas Pediococcus, as the second most abundant genus in the salted samples, was in fairly low abundance in the salt-free samples. Culture-dependent and -independent methods showed that the major lactic  bacteria in the salted samples were Lactobacillus plantarum, L. pentosus, Pediococcus pentosus and L. brevis, while the salt-free samples were predominated by L. fermentum, L. coryniformis and L. sp. The result indicated that salinity had a significant effect on the bacterial communities in Nanfeng yancai, which will improve our understanding of the bacterial ecology of yancai, as well as the relationships between physicochemical characteristics and the  of yancai.Copyright © 2019.
