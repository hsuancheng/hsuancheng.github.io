So, antioxidant therapy is necessary for successful treatment of the liver injury. We have paid attention to melanin produced by yeast Nadsoniella nigra strain X-1 as novel antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents with low toxicity. In current study we aimed to investigate the preventive effect of melanin on the monosodium glutamate (MSG) induced NAFLD model in rats.The study was carried out on 45 Wistar rats that were divided into 3 groups: intact, MSG- and MSG+melanin groups (n=15 in each group). Newborn rats of MSG- and MSG+melanin groups were administered with MSG (4mg/g, 8μl/g, subcutaneously) at 2nd-10th days of life. Since the age of 1 month, rats of MSG-group were treated with water (0.25ml/100g), rats of MSG+melanin groups-with melanin (1mg/kg) dissolved in water (0.25ml/100g).had been performed intermittently (two-week courses alternated with two-week breaks) for 3 months. In 4-month rats anthropometrical parameters and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass were estimated. To assess morphological changes in liver we used NAS (NAFLD activity score). The content of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-12Bp40, interferon (INF)-γ) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, tumor growth factor (TGF)-β) were measured by ELISA.We found significantly lower total score (1.0±0.19 vs 3.33±0.36, p<0.001), degree of steatosis (0.73±0.18 vs 1.80±0.17, p<0.001) and manifestation of lobular inflammation (0.27±0.11 vs 1.20±0.17, p<0.001) due to NAFLD activity score in MSG+melanin group compared to MSG-obesity.  we confirmed only in 33.3% of rats with MSG-obesity that was significantly higher than after melanin (6.7%) administration (p=0.033). Melanin administration reduce amount of visceral fat on 44.5% (p<0.001) as compared to MSG-obesity group. Melanin reduced the content of IL-1β in rat serum and restored the level of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β) to the control values.Thus, the administration of melanin can prevent development of NAFLD/ in rats with MSG-induced obesity and can be considered as possible novel therapeutic agents but further studies to confirm its action needed.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a negative modulator of insulin and cytokine signaling, is a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes and obesity. We investigated the impact of PTP1B deficiency during NAFLD, particularly in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). features were evaluated in livers from wild-type (PTP1BWT) and PTP1B-deficient (PTP1BKO) mice fed methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD) for 8 weeks. A recovery model was established by replacing MCD to chow diet (CHD) for 2-7 days. Non-parenchymal liver cells (NPCs) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Oval cells markers were measured in human and mouse livers with , and in oval cells from PTP1BWT and PTP1BKO mice.PTP1BWT mice fed MCD for 8 weeks exhibited , NPCs infiltration, and elevated Fgf21, Il6 and Il1b mRNAs. These parameters decreased after switching to CHD. PTP1B deficiency accelerated MCD-induced . Conversely, after switching to CHD, PTP1BKO mice rapidly reverted  compared to PTP1BWT mice in parallel to the normalization of serum triglycerides (TG) levels. Among NPCs, a drop in cytotoxic natural killer T (NKT) subpopulation was detected in PTP1BKO livers during recovery, and in these conditions M2 macrophage markers were up-regulated. Oval cells markers (EpCAM and cytokeratin 19) significantly increased during  only in PTP1B-deficient livers. HGF-mediated signaling and proliferative capacity were enhanced in PTP1BKO oval cells. In  patients, oval cells markers were also elevated.PTP1B elicits a dual role in  progression and reversion. Additionally, our results support a new role for PTP1B in oval cell proliferation during NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Free fatty acids (FFAs) are known to induce lipoapoptosis in liver cells in a c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent, but death receptor-independent way (2). As non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () is associated with hyperinsulinemia and increased FFA-blood levels, the interplay between insulin and FFA was studied with regard to hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis in isolated rat and mouse hepatocytes. Saturated long chain FFAs induced apoptosis and JNK activation in primary rat hepatocytes, but did not activate the CD95 (Fas, APO-1) system, whereas insulin triggered EGFR activation and hepatocyte proliferation. Coadministration of insulin and FFAs, however, abolished hepatocyte proliferation and triggered CD95-dependent apoptosis due to a JNK-dependent association of the activated EGFR with CD95, subsequent CD95  phosphorylation and formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). JNK inhibition restored the proliferative insulin effect in presence of FFAs and prevented EGFR/CD95 association, CD95  phosphorylation and DISC formation. Likewise, in presence of FFAs insulin increased apoptosis in hepatocytes from wild type but not from Alb-Cre-FAS(fl/fl) mice, which lack functional CD95. It is concluded that FFAs can shift insulin-induced hepatocyte proliferation toward hepatocyte apoptosis by triggering a JNK signal, which allows activated EGFR to associate with CD95 and to trigger CD95-dependent apoptosis.

One of the advanced pathologies is nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), which is associated with induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and disruption of autophagic flux. However, the mechanisms by which these processes contribute to the pathogenesis of human diseases are unclear. Herein, we identify the α isoform of the inhibitor of Bruton's  kinase (IBTKα) as a member of the UPR, whose expression is preferentially translated during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We found that IBTKα is located in the ER and associates with proteins LC3b, SEC16A, and SEC31A and plays a previously unrecognized role in phagophore initiation from ER exit sites. Depletion of IBTKα helps prevent accumulation of autophagosome intermediates stemming from exposure to saturated free fatty acids and rescues hepatocytes from death. Of note, induction of IBTKα and the UPR, along with inhibition of autophagic flux, was associated with progression from steatosis to  in liver biopsies. These results indicate a function for IBTKα in  that links autophagy with activation of the UPR.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29295587>Dopamine and Levodopa Prodrugs for the Treatment of Parkinson's Disease.</a></h1><p>: Parkinson's disease is an aggressive and progressive neurodegenerative disorder that depletes dopamine (DA) in the central nervous system. Dopamine replacement therapy, mainly through actual dopamine and its original prodrug l-dopa (LD), faces many challenges such as poor blood brain barrier penetration and decreased response to therapy with time. : The prodrugs described herein are ester, amide, dimeric amide, carrier-mediated, peptide transport-mediated, cyclic, chemical delivery systems and enzyme-models prodrugs designed and made by chemical means, and their bioavailability was studied in animals.  A promising ester prodrug for intranasal delivery has been developed. LD methyl ester is currently in Phase III clinical trials. A series of amide prodrugs were synthesized with better stability than ester prodrugs. Both amide and dimeric amide prodrugs offer enhanced blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration and better pharmacokinetics. Attaching LD to sugars has been used to exploit glucose transport mechanisms into the brain. : Till now, no DA prodrug has reached the pharmaceutical market, nevertheless, the future of utilizing prodrugs for the treatment of PD seems to be bright. For instance, LD ester prodrugs have demonstrated an adequate intranasal delivery of LD, thus enabling the absorption of therapeutic agents to the brain. Most of the amide, cyclic, peptidyl or chemical delivery systems of DA prodrugs demonstrated enhanced pharmacokinetic properties.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27984078>Anti-inflammatory and protective effects of MT-031, a novel multitarget MAO-A and AChE/BuChE inhibitor in scopolamine mouse model and inflammatory cells.</a></h1><p>Previous study demonstrated that the novel multitarget compound, MT-031 preserved in one molecule entity the beneficial properties of its parent drugs, rasagiline and rivastigmine, and exerted high dual potencies of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) and cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition in acute-treated mice and neuroprotective effects against HO-induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. The present study aimed to further investigate the anti-inflammatory and protective effects of MT-031 in scopolamine mouse model and inflammatory cell cultures. Our findings demonstrated that once daily chronic administration of MT-031 (5-10 mg/kg) to mice antagonized scopolamine-induced memory and cognitive impairments, displayed brain selective MAO-A and AChE/BuChE inhibition, increased the levels of striatal dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine and prevented the metabolism of DA and 5-HT. In addition, MT-031 upregulated mRNA expression levels of Bcl-2, the neurotrophic factors, (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF)), the antioxidant enzyme catalase and the anti-inflammatory cytokine, neurotrophic  kinase receptor (Ntrk), and down-regulated the mRNA expression levels of the pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-6 in scopolamine-induced mice. In accordance, MT-031 was shown to reduce reactive oxygen species accumulation, increase the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and decrease the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17 and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in activated mouse splenocytes and microglial cells. Taken together, these pharmacological properties of MT-031 can be of clinical importance for developing this novel multitarget compound as a novel drug candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This is known to be a step forward from simple steatosis caused during the first hit, which leads to the stage of inflammation followed by more serious liver conditions like non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and cirrhosis. Immune-deficient animal models serve as an important tool for understanding the role of a specific cell type or a cytokine in the progression of NAFLD. These animal models can be used in combination with the already available animal models of NAFLD, including dietary models, as well as genetically modified mouse models. Advancements in molecular biological techniques enabled researchers to produce several new animal models for the study of NAFLD, including knockin, generalized knockout, and tissue-specific knockout mice. Development of /NAFLD in various animal models having compromised immune system is discussed in this review.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27974211>Dual Shp2 and Pten Deficiencies Promote Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis and Genesis of Liver Tumor-Initiating Cells.</a></h1><p>The complexity of liver tumorigenesis is underscored by the recently observed anti-oncogenic effects of oncoproteins, although the mechanisms are unclear. Shp2/Ptpn11 is a proto-oncogene in hematopoietic cells and antagonizes the effect of tumor suppressor Pten in leukemogenesis. In contrast, we show here cooperative functions of Shp2 and Pten in suppressing hepatocarcinogenesis. Ablating both Shp2 and Pten in hepatocytes induced early-onset non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and promoted genesis of liver tumor-initiating cells likely due to augmented cJun expression/activation and elevated ROS and inflammation in the hepatic microenvironment. Inhibiting cJun partially suppressed -driven liver tumorigenesis without improving . SHP2 and PTEN deficiencies were detected in liver cancer patients with poor prognosis. These data depict a mechanism of hepato-oncogenesis and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy.Copyright © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

There are several signals produced by neurons that have an anti-inflammatory action on microglia, including CX3CL1 (fractalkine). We have shown that a soluble form of CX3CL1 is required to reduce neuron loss in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice and that fractalkine agonism can reduce neuron loss in a 6-hydroxydopamine lesion model. Here, we show that fractalkine can reduce α-synuclein-mediated neurodegeneration in rats. Rats that received fractalkine showed abrogated loss of  hydroxylase and Neu-N staining. This was replicated in animals where we expressed fractalkine from astrocytes with the glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) promoter. Interestingly, we did not observe a reduction in MHCII expression suggesting that soluble fractalkine is likely altering the microglial state to a more neuroprotective one rather than reducing antigen presentation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27893463>Inhibition of the GAS6/AXL pathway augments the efficacy of chemotherapies.</a></h1><p>The AXL receptor and its activating ligand, growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6), are important drivers of metastasis and therapeutic resistance in human cancers. Given the critical roles that GAS6 and AXL play in refractory disease, this signaling axis represents an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. However, the strong picomolar binding affinity between GAS6 and AXL and the promiscuity of small molecule inhibitors represent important challenges faced by current anti-AXL therapeutics. Here, we have addressed these obstacles by engineering a second-generation, high-affinity AXL decoy receptor with an apparent affinity of 93 femtomolar to GAS6. Our decoy receptor, MYD1-72, profoundly inhibited disease progression in aggressive preclinical models of human cancers and induced cell killing in leukemia cells. When directly compared with the most advanced anti-AXL small molecules in the clinic, MYD1-72 achieved superior antitumor efficacy while displaying no toxicity. Moreover, we uncovered a relationship between AXL and the cellular response to DNA damage whereby abrogation of AXL signaling leads to accumulation of the DNA-damage markers γH2AX, 53BP1, and RAD51. MYD1-72 exploited this relationship, leading to improvements upon the therapeutic index of current standard-of-care chemotherapies in preclinical models of advanced pancreatic and ovarian cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29660503>High circulatory leptin mediated NOX-2-peroxynitrite-miR21 axis activate mesangial cells and promotes renal inflammatory pathology in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>High circulatory insulin and leptin followed by underlying inflammation are often ascribed to the ectopic manifestations in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) but the exact molecular pathways remain unclear. We have shown previously that CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress and circulating leptin in NAFLD is associated with renal disease severity. Extending the studies, we hypothesized that high circulatory leptin in NAFLD causes renal mesangial cell activation and tubular inflammation via a NOX2 dependent pathway that upregulates proinflammatory miR21. High-fat diet (60% kcal) was used to induce fatty liver phenotype with parallel insulin and leptin resistance. The kidneys were probed for mesangial cell activation and tubular inflammation that showed accelerated  phenotype and oxidative stress in the liver. Results showed that NAFLD kidneys had significant increases in α-SMA, a marker of mesangial cell activation, miR21 levels,  nitration and renal inflammation while they were significantly decreased in leptin and p47 phox knockout mice. Micro RNA21 knockout mice showed decreased tubular immunotoxicity and proinflammatory mediator release. Mechanistically, use of NOX2 siRNA or apocynin,phenyl boronic acid (FBA), DMPO or miR21 antagomir inhibited leptin primed-miR21-mediated mesangial cell activation in vitro suggesting a direct role of leptin-mediated NOX-2 in miR21-mediated mesangial cell activation. Finally, JAK-STAT inhibitor completely abrogated the mesangial cell activation in leptin-primed cells suggesting that leptin signaling in the mesangial cells depended on the JAK-STAT pathway. Taken together the study reports a novel mechanistic pathway of leptin-mediated renal inflammation that is dependent on NOX-2-miR21 axis in ectopic manifestations underlying NAFLD-induced co-morbidities.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Normal physiological changes that occur during the aging process reflect the pathological characteristics of Parkinson's disease. It is also recognized that age related changes significantly interact with the pathological mechanisms that underlie the neurodegeneration in PD and perpetuate the disease process. Despite the fact that aging is considered to be a primary risk factor for developing PD, the use of aged animal models are still under-utilized in pre-clinical research, thus reducing the translatability of experimental findings. Here, we use a natural compound astaxanthin (AXT) with multiple biological activities to attenuate neurotoxicity in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease in both young and aged mice. We observed that AXT preserved neurons in the substantia nigra of both young and aged mice that were exposed to the MPTP neurotoxin. However, AXT was less efficacious in the aged animals, as AXT was not able to protect against the MPTP induced loss of  hydroxylase (TH) throughout the aged nigro-striatal circuit. This disparity in the neuroprotective effect of AXT suggests that aging is a critical factor to consider during the development of novel therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases and should be more rigorously evaluated in preclinical models.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826467>Reduced biliverdin reductase-A levels are associated with early alterations of insulin signaling in obesity.</a></h1><p>Biliverdin reductase-A (BVR-A) is a serine/threonine/ kinase involved in the regulation of insulin signaling. In vitro studies have demonstrated that BVR-A is a substrate of the insulin receptor and regulates IRS1 by avoiding its aberrant activation, and in animal model of obesity the loss of hepatic BVR-A has been associated with glucose/insulin alterations and fatty liver disease. However, no studies exist in humans. Here, we evaluated BVR-A expression levels and activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from obese subjects and matched lean controls and we investigated the related molecular alterations of the insulin along with clinical correlates. We showed that BVR-A levels are significantly reduced in obese subjects and associated with a hyper-activation of the IR/IRS1/Akt/GSK-3β/AS160/GLUT4 pathway. Low BVR-A levels also associate with the presence of obesity, metabolic syndrome,  and visceral adipose tissue inflammation. These data suggest that the reduction of BVR-A may be responsible for early alterations of the insulin signaling pathway in obesity and in this context may represent a novel molecular target to be investigated for the comprehension of the process of insulin resistance development in obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Sorafenib shows efficacy in the management of non-resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is refractory to other chemotherapeutic drugs. HCC represents a major end point of chronic liver diseases and the third leading cause of cancer-related death. In HCC patients Sorafenib increases overall survival compared to placebo. The most common chronic liver disease affecting up to 30% of the population in Western countries is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), an intra-hepatic amassing of triglycerides deemed as the hepatic manifestation of insulin resistance and obesity. NAFLD encompasses a range of disorders with grades of liver damage varying from steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), hallmarked by hepatocellular injury/inflammation in the presence or not of fibrosis. NAFLD patients progress to  in 10% of cases, which may progress to cirrhosis and HCC. Recent exciting studies uncovered a potential therapeutic role for Sorafenib that goes beyond HCC, and extends to cirrhotic portal hypertensive syndrome during cirrhosis, and to selective anti-fibrotic effects mediated through direct inhibition of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC), the cellular mediators of intra-hepatic matrix deposition. The aim of this review is to concisely summarize our current knowledge of the biology, epidemiology and clinical aspects of HCC, as well as the previously under-appreciated therapeutic efficacy of Sorafenib beyond HCC.

To the authors' knowledge, the clinicopathologic and genomic predictors of OM-CRC are poorly characterized and optimal clinical management remains unclear.Women with a histopathological diagnosis of OM-CRC who were treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from 1999 to 2015 were identified. Next-generation somatic mutation profiling (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets [MSK-IMPACT]) was performed on 38 OM-CRC cases, including 21 matched tumor pairs/trios. Regression models were used to analyze variables associated with progression-free survival and overall survival (OS).Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS), SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4), and neurotrophic receptor  kinase 1 (NTRK1) mutations were more frequent in cases of OM-CRC than in instances of CRC occurring without OM. SMAD4 and lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) mutations were associated with reduced OS. Matched multisite tumor sequencing did not identify OM-specific genomic alterations. Of the 195 patients who underwent oophorectomy for OM-CRC (median age, 49 years with a progression-free survival of 9.4 months and an OS of 23 months from oophorectomy), 76% had extraovarian metastasis (EOM). In multivariable analysis, residual disease after surgery (R2 resection) was associated with worse survival. Patients with EOM were less likely to achieve R0/R1 surgical resection status (complete macroscopic resection without clinical/radiological evidence of disease) (48% vs 94%). However, if R0/R1 resection status was achieved, both patients with (35.9 months vs 12 months) and without (43.2 months vs 14.5 months) EOM were found to have better OS. Among 114 patients with R0/R1 resection status, 23 (20%) had no disease recurrence, including 10 patients (9%) with > 3 years of follow-up.Loss-of-function alterations in SMAD4 are frequent and predictive of worse survival in patients with OM-CRC. Similar to oligometastatic CRC to the lung or liver, surgical resection of OM-CRC is associated with a better outcome only if all macroscopic metastatic disease is resected.

This study aimed to analyse the relationship between the JAK2-STAT3 signalling pathway and the ameliorating effect of HGF on .Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks, and then plasma and hepatic tissues were collected. Histological and clinical chemistry assays were performed to assess liver disease. The mRNA and protein levels of JAK2, STAT3, and c-Met were assessed by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively.Serum ALT, AST, and TG levels were increased in  mice. Histological analysis showed different degrees of steatosis, inflammatory infiltrates, and fibrosis in HFD animals. Exogenous administration of recombinant human (rh) HGF via the tail vein for 14 days markedly decreased ALT and AST to levels lower than those in the control group. Compared with the levels in HFD mice, c-Met, p-c-Met, JAK2, p-JAK2, and p-STAT3 levels were increased in mice that were administered HGF (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, silencing of HGF or blocking of its receptor c-Met affected JAK2 and STAT3 protein phosphorylation.Excess HGF highly probable improved  liver function.

NAFLD can progress from simple hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). However, the mechanisms predisposing to this progression remain undefined. Notably, hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction is a common finding in patients with . Due to a lack of appropriate experimental animal models, it has not been evaluated whether this mitochondrial dysfunction plays a causative role for the development of .To determine the effect of a well-defined mitochondrial dysfunction on liver physiology at baseline and during dietary challenge, C57BL/6J-mt(FVB/N) mice were employed. This conplastic inbred strain has been previously reported to exhibit decreased mitochondrial respiration likely linked to a non-synonymous gene variation (nt7778 G/T) of the mitochondrial ATP synthase protein 8 (mt-ATP8).At baseline conditions, C57BL/6J-mt(FVB/N) mice displayed hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by decreased ATP production and increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, genes affecting lipid metabolism were differentially expressed, hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol levels were changed in these animals, and various acyl-carnitines were altered, pointing towards an impaired mitochondrial carnitine shuttle. However, over a period of twelve months, no spontaneous hepatic steatosis or inflammation was observed. On the other hand, upon dietary challenge with either a methionine and choline deficient diet or a western-style diet, C57BL/6J-mt(FVB/N) mice developed aggravated steatohepatitis as characterized by lipid accumulation, ballooning of hepatocytes and infiltration of immune cells.We observed distinct metabolic alterations in mice with a mitochondrial polymorphism associated hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction.

Nitric oxide (NO) formed by NO synthase (NOS) is known to be protective in ischemic stroke, however NOS has been shown to 'uncouple' under oxidative conditions to instead produce ROS. Nitrones are antioxidant molecules that are shown to trap ROS to then decompose and release NO. In this study, the nitrone 5 was designed such that its decomposition product is a NOS inhibitor, 6, effectively leading to NOS inhibition specifically at the site of ROS production. The ability of 5 to spin-trap radicals and decompose to 6 was observed using EPR and LC-MS/MS. The pro-drug concept was tested in vitro by measuring cell viability and 6 formation in SH-SY5Y cells subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). 5 was found to be more efficacious and more potent than PBN, and was able to increase phospho-Akt while reducing nitrotyrosine and cleaved caspase-3 levels. 6 treatment, but not 5, was found to decrease NO production in LPS-stimulated microglia. Doppler flowmetry on anesthetized mice showed increased cerebral blood flow upon intravenous administration of 1mg/kg of 5, but a return to baseline upon administration of 10mg/kg, likely due to its dual nature of antioxidant/NO-donor and NOS-inhibition. Mice treated with 5 after permanent ischemia exhibited a >30% reduction in infarct volume, and higher formation of 6 in ischemic tissue resulting in region specific effects limited to the infarct area.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In total, 1140 data of PFAAs could be analyzed in patients with CLDs dependent of their Child-Pugh (CP) score.Various imbalances in PFAAs were observed in each CLDs during the progression. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that among 24 PFAAs, the level of plasma-branched chain amino acids (pBCAAs) was significantly associated with the CP score, especially the sAlb score, in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (CHC), NAFLD/ and PBC. The correlation coefficient values between sAlb and pBCAAs-to- ratio (BTR) in these patients were 0.53, 0.53 and 0.79, respectively. Interestingly, although the pBCAAs in NAFLD/ patients varied even when the sAlb was within the normal range, the pBCAAs tended to be low when the sAlb was below the normal range.Although a decrease in the level of pBCAAs was observed during the progression regardless of the CLD etiology, the level of total pBCAAs was independently associated with the sAlb level in the PFAAs of CHC, PBC and NAFLD/. The correlation between sAlb and BTR showed the highest value in PBC patients among the patients with CLDs. A decrease in pBCAAs often occurred in  even when the sAlb level was kept in the normal range.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30219279>Therapeutic inhibition of spleen  kinase in inflammatory macrophages using PLGA nanoparticles for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () is the leading cause of cirrhosis worldwide and the most rapidly growing indication for liver transplantation. Macrophages are the important cellular component in the inflammatory milieu in . Inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators produced by macrophages causes significant tissue injury in many inflammatory diseases. Therefore, inhibition of the inflammatory macrophages would be a promising approach to attenuate . In this study, we studied the implication of SYK pathway in , and investigated PLGA nanoparticles-based delivery of SYK pathway inhibitor as an effective and promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of . We found positive correlation between SYK expression with the pathogenesis of  and alcoholic hepatitis in patients. Importantly, SYK expression was significantly induced in M1-differentiated inflammatory macrophages. To inhibit SYK pathway specifically, we used a small-molecule inhibitor R406 that blocks Fc-receptor signaling pathway and reduces immune complex-mediated inflammation. R406 dose-dependently inhibited nitric-oxide release and M1-specific markers in M1-differentiated macrophages. Thereafter, we synthesized PLGA nanoparticles to deliver R406 to increase the drug pharmacokinetics for the efficient treatment of . We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of R406-PLGA in-vitro in differentiated macrophages, and in-vivo in Methionine-Choline-deficient (MCD)-diet induced  mouse model. R406-PLGA inhibited M1-specific differentiation markers in RAW and bone-marrow-derived macrophages. In-vivo, R406 and more strongly R406-PLGA ameliorated fibrosis, inflammation and steatosis in mice. R406 and more significantly R406-PLGA reduced ALT, AST, cholesterol and triglyceride plasma levels. These results suggest that delivery of SYK inhibitor using PLGA nanoparticles can be a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

The main study objective was to assess whether MERTK AA genotype influences liver fibrosis, and secondarily MERTK expression in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We also investigated whether MERTK is expressed in human hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and in murine models of fibrogenesis.We considered 533 consecutive patients who underwent liver biopsy for suspected non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () without severe obesity from two Italian cohorts. As controls, we evaluated 158 patients with normal liver enzymes and without metabolic disturbances. MERTK rs4374383 genotype was assessed by 5'-nuclease assays. MERTK expression was analysed in mouse models of fibrosis, and the effect of the MERTK ligand GAS6 were investigated in human HSC.Clinically significant fibrosis (stage F2-F4) was observed in 19% of patients with MERTK AA compared to 30% in those with MERTK GG/GA (OR 0.43, CI 0.21-0.88, p=0.02; adjusted for centre, and genetic, clinical-metabolic and histological variables). The protective rs4374383 AA genotype was associated with lower MERTK hepatic expression. MERTK was overexpressed in the liver of NAFLD patients with F2-F4 fibrosis and in in vivo models of fibrogenesis. Furthermore, exposure of cultured human HSC to the MERTK ligand GAS6, increased cell migration and induced procollagen expression. These effects were counteracted by inhibition of MERTK activity, which also resulted in apoptotic death of HSC.The rs4374383 AA genotype, associated with lower intrahepatic expression of MERTK, is protective against F2-F4 fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. The mechanism may involve modulation of HSC activation.Copyright © 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that in liver, NADPH oxidase activation is key in TLR4 recruitment into lipid rafts, which in turn up-regulates NF-κB translocation to the nucleus and subsequent DNA binding, leading to  progression. Results from confocal microscopy showed that liver from murine and human  had NADPH oxidase activation, which led to the formation of highly reactive peroxynitrite, as shown by 3-nitrotyrosine formation in diseased liver. Expression and recruitment of TLR4 into the lipid rafts were significantly greater in rodent and human . The described phenomenon was NADPH oxidase, p47phox, and peroxynitrite dependent, as liver from p47phox-deficient mice and from mice treated with a peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst [iron(III) tetrakis(p-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin] or a peroxynitrite scavenger (phenylboronic acid) had markedly less Tlr4 recruitment into lipid rafts. Mechanistically, peroxynitrite-induced TLR4 recruitment was linked to increased IL-1β, sinusoidal injury, and Kupffer cell activation while blocking peroxynitrite-attenuated  symptoms. The results strongly suggest that NADPH oxidase-mediated peroxynitrite drove TLR4 recruitment into hepatic lipid rafts and inflammation, whereas the in vivo use of the peroxynitrite scavenger phenylboronic acid, a novel synthetic molecule having high reactivity with peroxynitrite, attenuates inflammatory pathogenesis in .Copyright © 2015 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

These toxic fatty acids can induce liver cell death and our recent results demonstrated that the biliary epithelium may be susceptible to lipotoxicity. Here, we explored the molecular mechanisms of cholangiocyte lipoapoptosis in cell culture and in an animal model of . Treatment of cholangiocytes with palmitate (PA) showed increased caspase 3/7 activity and increased levels of cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and cleaved caspase 3, demonstrating cholangiocyte lipoapoptosis. Interestingly, treatment with PA significantly increased the levels of microRNA miR-34a, a pro-apoptotic microRNA known to be elevated in . PA induction of miR-34a was abolished in cholangiocytes transduced with forkhead family of transcription factor class O (FoxO)3 shRNA, demonstrating that FoxO3 activation is upstream of miR-34a and suggesting that FoxO3 is a novel transcriptional regulator of miR-34a. Further, anti-miR-34a protected cholangiocytes from PA-induced lipoapoptosis. Direct and indirect targets of miR-34a, such as SIRT1, receptor  kinase (MET), Kruppel-like factor 4, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)1, and FGFR4, were all decreased in PA-treated cholangiocytes. SIRT1 and MET were partially rescued by a miR-34a antagonist. Cholangiocyte apoptosis and miR-34a were dramatically increased in the liver of mice with early histologic features of .

However, any direct role of oxidative stress in causing M1 polarization in  has been unclear. We hypothesized that CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress causes M1 polarization in experimental , and that nitric oxide (NO) donor administration inhibits CYP2E1-mediated inflammation with concomitant attenuation of M1 polarization. Because CYP2E1 takes center stage in these studies, we used a toxin model of  that uses a ligand and a substrate of CYP2E1 for inducing . Subsequently, we used a methionine and choline-deficient diet-induced rodent  model where the role of CYP2E1 in disease progression has been shown. Our results show that CYP2E1 causes M1 polarization bias, which includes a significant increase in interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-12 in both models of , whereas CYP2E1-null mice or diallyl sulfide administration prevented it. Administration of gadolinium chloride (GdCl3), a macrophage toxin, attenuated both the initial M1 response and the subsequent M2 response, showing that the observed increase in cytokine levels is primarily from macrophages. Based on the evidence of an adaptive NO increase, the NO donor administration in vivo that mechanistically inhibited CYP2E1 catalyzed the oxidative stress during the entire study in -abrogated M1 polarization and  progression.

The MSP/Ron receptor axis has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties in a number of mouse models, due at least in part, to its ability to limit pro-inflammatory responses in tissue-resident macrophages and hepatocytes. In this study, we established the role of the Ron receptor in steatohepatitis-induced hepatic fibrosis using Ron ligand domain knockout mice on an apolipoprotein E knockout background (DKO). After 18 weeks of high-fat high-cholesterol feeding, loss of Ron activation resulted in exacerbated -associated steatosis which is precedent to hepatocellular injury, inflammation and fibrosis. H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics identified significant changes in serum metabolites that can modulate the intrahepatic lipid pool in hepatic steatosis. Serum from DKO mice had higher concentrations of lipids, VLDL/LDL and pyruvate, whereas glycine levels were reduced. Parallel to the aggravated steatohepatitis, increased accumulation of collagen, inflammatory immune cells and collagen producing-myofibroblasts were seen in the livers of DKO mice. Gene expression profiling revealed that DKO mice exhibited elevated expression of genes encoding Ron receptor ligand MSP, collagens, ECM remodeling proteins and pro-fibrogenic cytokines in the liver.

Here we propose a novel segmentation framework using an Active Contour Model to automate the collection of stereology from stained cells and other objects in tissue sections. This approach is demonstrated for stained brain sections from young adult Fischer 344 rats. Animals were perfused in-vivo with 4% paraformaldehyde and sectioned by frozen microtomy at an instrument setting of 40 μm. For each rat brain, a systematic-random set of sections through the entire substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) were immunostained to reveal  hydroxylase (TH)-immunopositive neurons. The novel framework applied an active contour (modified balloon snake) model with non-constant balloon force to automatically segment and quantify neuronal cell bodies by stereological point counting (SPC). Several contours were initialized in the image and based on the contour fit after 200 iterations classified as immunopositive (signal) or background contours in a sequential manner. Cell contours were determined in four steps based on several criteria, e.g., area of contour, dispersion measure, and degree of overlap. The image was automatically segmented according to the final contours. Using a point grid automatically generated at systematic-random orientations over the images, points hitting the segmented neural cell bodies were automatically counted. The final values from the automatic framework were compared with findings for ground truth (manual SPC). The results of this study show a strong agreement between data collected by the automatic framework and the ground truth (R ≥ 0.95) with a 5× gain in time efficiency for the automatic SPC. These findings give strong support for future applications of pattern recognition for assessing stereological parameters of biological objects identified by high signal:noise stains.Copyright © 2018.

Leucocytes and platelets express multiple isoforms of the SFKs. Previous studies used broad-spectrum pharmacological inhibitors, or murine models deficient in multiple SFK isoforms, to demonstrate the functional consequences of deficiencies in SFK signalling. Here, we hypothesized that individual SFK operate in a non-redundant fashion in the thrombo-inflammatory recruitment of monocyte during atherosclerosis. Using in vitro adhesion assays and single SFK knockout mice crossed with the ApoE model of atherosclerosis, we find that SFK signalling regulates platelet-dependent recruitment of monocytes. However, loss of a single SFK, Fgr or Lyn, reduced platelet-mediated monocyte recruitment in vitro. This translated into a significant reduction in the burden of atherosclerotic disease in Fgr /ApoE or Lyn /ApoE animals. SFK signalling is not redundant in thrombo-inflammatory vascular disease and individual SFK may represent targets for therapeutic intervention.© 2018 The Authors.

We studied MG characteristics in a cohort of Ashkenazi (ASH) and non-Ashkenazi () Jewish origin according to their ethnic origins and gender. The frequency of age of MG onset was distributed in a bi-modal fashion in the female patients and increased gradually over time, with a peak around 70years of age in the male patients. Ocular MG was more frequent in males and ASH patients. Unlike previous reports, our male patients had a higher proportion of positive serum anti-acetyl choline receptor (AChR) than female patients, with no ethnic-based differences in the rates of anti-AChR or anti-muscle specific kinase. Comorbidity with another autoimmune disease was more frequent among female patients with late-onset MG and  patients (mainly Israel-born). Male MG patients tended to have more malignant comorbidities than female MG patients. These results demonstrate the effect of ethnicity on clinical aspects of MG within the Jewish population in Israel, and reveal novel effects of gender-associated comorbidities in patients with MG.Copyright © 2017.

The nonessential amino acid glutamine (Gln) has been suggested to have protective effects on intestinal barrier function but also against the development of liver diseases of various etiologies.The effect of oral Gln supplementation on the development of Western-style diet (WSD)-induced  in mice was assessed.Female 6- to 8-wk-old C57BL/6J mice were pair-fed a control (C) diet or a WSD alone or supplemented with 2.1 g l-Gln/kg body weight for 6 wk (C+Gln or WSD+Gln). Indexes of liver damage, lipid peroxidation, and glucose metabolism and endotoxin concentrations were measured.Although Gln supplementation had no effect on the loss of the tight junction protein occludin, the increased portal endotoxin and fasting glucose concentrations found in WSD-fed mice, markers of liver damage (e.g., nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score and number of neutrophils in the liver) were significantly lower in the WSD+Gln group than in the WSD group (~47% and ~60% less, respectively; P < 0.05). Concentrations of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein and 3-nitrotyrosin protein adducts were significantly higher in livers of WSD-fed mice than in all other groups (~8.6- and ~1.9-fold higher, respectively, compared with the C group; P < 0.05) but did not differ between WSD+Gln-, C-, and C+Gln-fed mice. Hepatic tumor necrosis factor α and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 concentrations were significantly higher in WSD-fed mice (~1.6- and ~1.8-fold higher, respectively; P < 0.05) but not in WSD+Gln-fed mice compared with C mice.Our data suggest that the protective effects of oral Gln supplementation on the development of WSD-induced  in mice are associated with protection against the induction of iNOS and lipid peroxidation in the liver.© 2015 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28666623>Geranylnaringenin (CG902) inhibits constitutive and inducible STAT3 activation through the activation of SHP-2  phosphatase.</a></h1><p>The roles and significance of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in human cancers have been extensively studied and STAT3 is a promising therapeutic target for cancer drug discovery. During the screening of natural products to identify STAT3 inhibitors, we identified geranylnaringenin (CG902), which decreased luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. CG902 specifically inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr-705 in DU145 prostate cancer cells and decreased the expression levels of STAT3 target genes, such as cyclin D1, cyclin A, and survivin. Notably, the knockdown of the SHP-2 gene by small interfering RNA suppressed the ability of CG902 to inhibit STAT3 activation and CG902 activated the phosphatase activity of SHP-2 through direct interaction with SHP-2 and induced the phosphorylation of SHP-2. The interactions between CG902 and SHP-2 were confirmed by pull-down assay using biotinylated CG902. The interactions were also further validated by the drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). The inhibitory effect of CG902 on cell growth was confirmed using the DU145 mouse xenograft model. We propose that CG902 inhibits STAT3 activity through a mechanism that involves the interactions between CG902 and SHP-2, and the phosphorylation of SHP-2, which leads to SHP-2 activation in DU145 cells. CG902 is the first compound to regulate STAT3 activity via the modulation of SHP-2 activity, and our results suggest that CG902 is a novel inhibitor of the STAT3 pathway and an activator of SHP-2, and may be a useful lead molecule for the development of a therapeutic STAT3 inhibitor.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We sought to investigate the mechanism by which SYK promotes liver fibrosis and to evaluate SYK as a therapeutic target for liver fibrosis. We evaluated the cellular localization of SYK and the association between SYK expression and liver fibrogenesis in normal, hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () liver tissue (n=36, 127, 22 and 30, respectively). A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array was used to detect the changes in transcription factor (TF) expression in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) with SYK knockdown. The effects of SYK antagonism on liver fibrogenesis were studied in LX-2 cells, TWNT-4 cells, primary human HSCs, and three progressive fibrosis/cirrhosis animal models, including a CCL mouse model, and diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and bile duct ligation (BDL) rat models. We found that SYK protein in HSCs and hepatocytes correlated positively with liver fibrosis stage in human liver tissue. HBV or HCV infection significantly increased SYK and cytokine expression in hepatocytes. Increasing cytokine production further induced SYK expression and fibrosis-related gene transcription in HSCs. Up-regulated SYK in HSCs promoted HSC activation by increasing the expression of specific TFs related to activation of HSCs. SYK antagonism effectively suppressed liver fibrosis via inhibition of HSC activation, and decreased obstructive jaundice and reduced HCC development in animal models.SYK promotes liver fibrosis via activation of HSCs and is an attractive potential therapeutic target for liver fibrosis and prevention of HCC development.

However, the mechanism underlying the relationship between amino acid imbalance and insulin resistance remains unclear. We evaluated serum amino acid concentrations in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease to determine if any of the levels of amino acids were associated with the biochemical markers and fibrosis stage of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ().In 137 patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease who underwent liver biopsy, plasma levels of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA),  (Tyr), and the BCAA-to-Tyr ratio values were determined using mass spectroscopy. These values were then assessed for associations with fibrosis stage, anthropometric markers (age, sex, and body mass index), biochemical markers (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, albumin, platelet count, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glycosylated hemoglobin), and relevant disease-specific biomarkers (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR], serum iron, ferritin, leptin, adiponectin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and hyaluronic acid).Serum albumin levels, plasma BCAA levels, and BCAA-to-Tyr ratio values were negatively associated with the fibrosis stage.

MerTK is mainly expressed in anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages where it mediates transcriptional changes including suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancement of inflammatory repressors. MerTK is regulated by metabolic pathways through nuclear sensors including LXRs, PPARs, and RXRs, in response to apoptotic bodies or to other sources of cholesterol. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. It is a clinicopathological syndrome closely related to obesity, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. It includes a spectrum of conditions ranging from simple steatosis, characterized by hepatic fat accumulation with or without inflammation, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), defined by hepatic fat deposition with hepatocellular damage, inflammation, and accumulating fibrosis. Several studies support an association between NAFLD and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, a major cause of death worldwide. This pathological condition consists in a chronic and progressive inflammatory process in the intimal layer of large- and medium-sized arteries. The complications of advanced atherosclerosis include chronic or acute ischemic damage in the tissue perfused by the affected artery, leading to cellular death. By identifying specific targets influencing lipid metabolism and cardiovascular-related diseases, the present review highlights the role of MerTK in NAFLD-associated atherosclerotic lesions as a potential innovative therapeutic target. Therapeutic advantages might derive from the use of compounds selective for nuclear receptors targeting PPARs rather than LXRs regulating macrophage lipid metabolism and macrophage mediated inflammation, by favoring the expression of MerTK, which mediates an immunoregulatory action with a reduction in inflammation and in atherosclerosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735525>Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition attenuates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the main causes of chronic liver disease. NAFLD begins with excessive lipid accumulation in the liver and progresses to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () and cirrhosis. NAFLD is closely linked to dysregulated hepatic lipid metabolism. Although recent studies have reported that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling regulates lipid metabolism, the roles of EGFR and EGFR inhibitors as modulators of lipid metabolism are largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether inhibiting EGFR using the EGFR  kinase inhibitor (TKI) PD153035 improves NAFLD. Our results demonstrate that EGFR was activated in liver tissues from high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice. Inhibiting EGFR using PD153035 significantly reduced phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling and sterol responsive elementary binding protein 1 and 2 expression, which prevented HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and hypercholesterolemia by reducing de novo lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis and enhancing fatty acid oxidation. Additionally, inhibiting EGFR improved HFD-induced glucose intolerance. In conclusion, these results indicate that EGFR plays an important role in NAFLD and is a potential therapeutic target.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25694214>Platelet adhesion to podoplanin under flow is mediated by the receptor CLEC-2 and stabilised by Src/Syk-dependent platelet signalling.</a></h1><p>Platelet-specific deletion of CLEC-2, which signals through Src and Syk kinases, or global deletion of its ligand podoplanin results in blood-filled lymphatics during mouse development. Platelet-specific Syk deficiency phenocopies this defect, indicating that platelet activation is required for lymphatic development. In the present study, we investigated whether CLEC-2-podoplanin interactions could support platelet arrest from blood flow and whether platelet signalling is required for stable platelet adhesion to lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and recombinant podoplanin under flow. Perfusion of human or mouse blood over human LEC monolayers led to platelet adhesion and aggregation. Following αIIbβ3 blockade, individual platelets still adhered. Platelet binding occurred at venous but not arterial shear rates. There was no adhesion using CLEC-2-deficient blood or to vascular endothelial cells (which lack podoplanin). Perfusion of human blood over human Fc-podoplanin (hFcPDPN) in the presence of monoclonal antibody IV.3 to block FcγRIIA receptors led to platelet arrest at similar shear rates to those used on LECs. Src and Syk inhibitors significantly reduced global adhesion of human or mouse platelets to LECs and hFcPDPN. A similar result was seen using Syk-deficient mouse platelets. Reduced platelet adhesion was due to a decrease in the stability of binding. In conclusion, our data reveal that CLEC-2 is an adhesive receptor that supports platelet arrest to podoplanin under venous shear. Src/Syk-dependent signalling stabilises platelet adhesion to podoplanin, providing a possible molecular mechanism contributing to the lymphatic defects of Syk-deficient mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25826083>PTPRO-mediated autophagy prevents hepatosteatosis and tumorigenesis.</a></h1><p>Autophagy plays a critical role in the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Protein  phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) was recently identified as a tumor suppressor, but little is known about its role in . Here, we investigated the role of PTPRO-dependent autophagy in insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, and hepatocarcinogenesis. Wild-type (WT) and ptpro-/- mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for another 16 weeks after diethylnitrosamine (DEN) injection to induce . Ptpro-/- mice exhibited severe liver injury, insulin resistance, hepatosteatosis and autophagy deficiency compared with WT littermates. PTPRO deletion also promoted the induction of lipogenic target genes and decreases in β-oxidation-related genes. Increased activation of AKT and accumulation of cytoplasmic p53 was detected in ptpro-/- mice, which in combination repressed autophagy. Intriguingly, hyperinsulinemia involving AKT activation was also exacerbated in HFD-fed mice due to PTPRO deletion. Activation of AKT induced stabilization of the MDMX/MDM2 heterocomplex, thus promoting p53 accumulation in the cytoplasm. Inhibition of AKT restored autophagy and p53 accumulation in hepatocytes, indicating that AKT acts upstream of p53. Due to hyperinsulinemia and autophagy deficiency, a HFD could aggravate steatohepatitis in ptpro-/- mice. Importantly, the expression of PTPRO was much decreased in human steatohepatitis, which was associated with increased p62 accumulation. Together, these data indicate that PTPRO regulates insulin and lipid metabolism via the PI3K/Akt/MDM4/MDM2/P53 axis by affecting autophagy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26028144>Platelet actin nodules are podosome-like structures dependent on Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and ARP2/3 complex.</a></h1><p>The actin nodule is a novel F-actin structure present in platelets during early spreading. However, only limited detail is known regarding nodule organization and function. Here we use electron microscopy, SIM and dSTORM super-resolution, and live-cell TIRF microscopy to characterize the structural organization and signalling pathways associated with nodule formation. Nodules are composed of up to four actin-rich structures linked together by actin bundles. They are enriched in the adhesion-related proteins talin and vinculin, have a central core of  phosphorylated proteins and are depleted of integrins at the plasma membrane. Nodule formation is dependent on Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) and the ARP2/3 complex. WASp(-/-) mouse blood displays impaired platelet aggregate formation at arteriolar shear rates. We propose actin nodules are platelet podosome-related structures required for platelet-platelet interaction and their absence contributes to the bleeding diathesis of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31078545>Histological evaluation of nintedanib in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis mice.</a></h1><p>In addition to potentially progressing to either cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () is currently the leading indication for liver transplantation. Nintedanib has been clinically used to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis for many years, but its effects in an animal model of  have not been tested. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of nintendanib on  in choline-deficient, l-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD)-fed mice.Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a CDAHFD for 6 weeks to induce  with liver fibrosis, and they were administered nintedanib (60 mg/kg/day) or distilled water orally in the last 2 weeks of the feeding period. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), triglyceride, and non-esterified fatty acids concentrations were measured. Serum cytokeratin 18 fragment (CK18) was detected using ELISA. Liver tissue sections from mice were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichrome to assess the level of steatohepatitis and fibrosis.CDAHFD-fed mice exhibited higher serum ALT, AST, and ALP levels compared with Control mice. A significant increase in the serum CK18 level was observed in the  group compared with the Control group. CDAHFD feeding also enhanced steatohepatitis and hepatic fibrosis pathological features, which were reduced after nintedanib treatment.Nintedanib exerted anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in CDAHFD-induced  mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

One resistance mechanism for cediranib is up-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This study aimed to determine if dual therapy with cediranib and the oral EGFR inhibitor gefitinib improved outcome in recurrent glioblastoma.This was a multi-center randomized, two-armed, double-blinded phase II study comparing cediranib plus gefitinib versus cediranib plus placebo in subjects with first relapse/first progression of glioblastoma following surgery and chemoradiotherapy. The primary outcome measure was progression free survival (PFS). Secondary outcome measures included overall survival (OS) and radiologic response rate. Recruitment was terminated early following suspension of the cediranib program. 38 subjects (112 planned) were enrolled with 19 subjects in each treatment arm. Median PFS with cediranib plus gefitinib was 3.6 months compared to 2.8 months for cediranib plus placebo (HR; 0.72, 90% CI; 0.41 to 1.26). Median OS was 7.2 months with cediranib plus gefitinib and 5.5 months with cediranib plus placebo (HR; 0.68, 90% CI; 0.39 to 1.19). Eight subjects (42%) had a partial response in the cediranib plus gefitinib arm versus five patients (26%) in the cediranib plus placebo arm.Cediranib and gefitinib in combination is tolerated in patients with glioblastoma. Incomplete recruitment led to the study being underpowered. However, a trend towards improved survival and response rates with the addition of gefitinib to cediranib was observed. Further studies of the combination incorporating EGFR and VEGF inhibition are warranted.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31024205>Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Etiology and Current and Future Drugs.</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is swiftly increasing in prevalence globally with a high mortality rate. The progression of HCC in patients is induced with advanced fibrosis, mainly cirrhosis, and hepatitis. The absence of proper preventive or curative treatment methods encouraged extensive research against HCC to develop new therapeutic strategies. The Food and Drug Administration-approved Nexavar (sorafenib) is used in the treatment of patients with unresectable HCC. In 2017, Stivarga (regorafenib) and Opdivo (nivolumab) got approved for patients with HCC after being treated with sorafenib, and in 2018, Lenvima (lenvatinib) got approved for patients with unresectable HCC. But, owing to the rapid drug resistance development and toxicities, these treatment options are not completely satisfactory. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new systemic combination therapies that target different signaling mechanisms, thereby decreasing the prospect of cancer cells developing resistance to treatment. In this review, HCC etiology and new therapeutic strategies that include currently approved drugs and other potential candidates of HCC such as Milciclib, palbociclib, galunisertib, ipafricept, and ramucirumab are evaluated.</p></html>
