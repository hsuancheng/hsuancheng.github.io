They are also controlled within individual cells by a variety of physiologically relevant signals. We investigated the effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids on the formation of  in brain capillary endothelial cells, monitoring the transepithelial electrical resistance, and analyzed the expression of occludin messenger RNA. Brain-capillary endothelial cells were grown to confluence on filters and exposed to eicosapentaenoic acids, gamma  and linoleic . Transepithelial electrical resistance was determined with voltage-measuring electrodes. The messenger RNA expression of occludin was quantitated by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The basal resistance across monolayers of porcine brain capillary endothelial cells was 83+/-8.1 Omega cm(2). Cells cultured in eicosapentaenoic acids and gamma , but not , displayed a 2.7-fold increase in transepithelial electrical resistance at 10 microM in brain capillary endothelial cells. The expression level of occludin messenger RNA increased markedly immediately after the exposure to eicosapentaenoic acids or gamma . Following an 8 h exposure to exogenous eicosapentaenoic acids or gamma , occludin messenger RNA levels were significantly increased. In addition, the rise in transepithelial electrical resistance induced by eicosapentaenoic acids and gamma  was markedly inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and PP2 and protein kinase C inhibitor, calphostin C. In contrast, the rise in transepithelial electrical resistance induced by eicosapentaenoic acids and gamma  was not inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002. We conclude that eicosapentaenoic acids and gamma  increased the transepithelial electrical resistance and the expression of occludin messenger RNA in brain capillary endothelial cells. This gamma  and eicosapentaenoic  induced assembly of  is likely to be regulated by protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25865774>Tissue invasion and metastasis: Molecular, biological and clinical perspectives.</a></h1><p>Cancer is a key health issue across the world, causing substantial patient morbidity and mortality. Patient prognosis is tightly linked with metastatic dissemination of the disease to distant sites, with metastatic diseases accounting for a vast percentage of cancer patient mortality. While advances in this area have been made, the process of cancer metastasis and the factors governing cancer spread and establishment at secondary locations is still poorly understood. The current article summarizes recent progress in this area of research, both in the understanding of the underlying biological processes and in the therapeutic strategies for the management of metastasis. This review lists the disruption of E-cadherin and , key signaling pathways, including urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene (PI3K/AKT), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), β-catenin/zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB-1) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), together with inactivation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and suppression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity as key targets and the use of phytochemicals, or natural products, such as those from Agaricus blazei, Albatrellus confluens, Cordyceps militaris, Ganoderma lucidum, Poria cocos and Silybum marianum, together with diet derived fatty acids gamma  (GLA) and eicosapentanoic  (EPA) and inhibitory compounds as useful approaches to target tissue invasion and metastasis as well as other hallmark areas of cancer. Together, these strategies could represent new, inexpensive, low toxicity strategies to aid in the management of cancer metastasis as well as having holistic effects against other cancer hallmarks.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Disruption can lead to leaky vascular bed and potentially to oedema and swelling of tissues, the aetiology of mastalgia. These changes may also cause vascular spread of cancer cells. This study aimed to determine whether the function of TJs in endothelial cells can be strengthened by gamma  (GLA), selenium (Se) and iodine (I) in the presence of 17beta-estradiol (17beta-estradiol), which causes leakage of endothelial cells by disruption of TJs in endothelium. GLA, I, and Se individually increased transendothelial resistance. The combination of all three agents also had a significant effect on TER. Addition of GLA/Se/I reduced PCP of the endothelial cells. Treatment with GLA/Se/I reversed the effect of 17beta-estradiol in reducing TER and increasing PCP. Immunofluorescence revealed that after treatment with Se/I/GLA over 24 h there was increasing relocation to endothelial cell-cell  of the TJ proteins Claudin-5, Occludin, and ZO-1. Interestingly, this relocation was particularly evident with treatments containing I when probing with Claudin-5 and those containing Se for Occludin. There was a small increase in overall protein levels when examined by Western blotting after treatment with GLA/Se/I when probed with Claudin-5 and Occludin. We report that GLA, I, and Se alone, or in combination are able to strengthen the function of TJs in human endothelial cells, by way of regulating the distribution of Claudin-5, Occludin, and ZO-1. Interestingly, this combination was also able to completely reverse the effect of 17beta-estradiol in these cells.(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25934114>Lowering the dietary omega-6: omega-3 does not hinder nonalcoholic fatty-liver disease development in a murine model.</a></h1><p>It is hypothesized that a high dietary n-6:n-3 (eg, 10-20:1) is partly responsible for the rise in obesity and related health ailments. However, no tightly controlled studies using high-fat diets differing in the n-6:n-3 have tested this hypothesis. The aim of the study was to determine the role that the dietary n-6:n-3 plays in non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease (NAFLD) and colitis development. We hypothesized that reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 would hinder the development of NAFLD and colitis. Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed high-fat diets, differing in the n-6:n-3 (1:1, 5:1, 10:1, 20:1), for 20 weeks. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyze the hepatic phospholipid arachidonic  (AA):eicosapentaenoic  and AA:docosahexaenoic . Hepatic metabolism, inflammatory signaling, macrophage polarization, gene expression of inflammatory mediators, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and oxidative capacity were assessed as well as colonic inflammatory signaling, and gene expression of inflammatory mediators and  proteins. Although reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 lowered the hepatic phospholipid AA:eicosapentaenoic  and AA:docosahexaenoic  in a dose-dependent manner and mildly influenced inflammatory signaling, it did not significantly attenuate NAFLD development. Furthermore, the onset of NAFLD was not paired to colitis development or changes in  protein gene expression. In conclusion, reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 did not attenuate NAFLD progression; nor is it likely that colitis, or gut permeability, plays a role in NAFLD initiation in this model.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Vancomycin hydrochloride (VCM) was used as a model drug with low oral bioavailability. The entrapment efficiency of VCM in the emulsion was approximately 60% and remained constant over storage for 1 month at 4 degrees C. The emulsion incorporating C18 unsaturated fatty acids or docosahexaenoic  (DHA) markedly enhanced VCM absorption after colonic and rectal dosing. The effectiveness of DHA on VCM colonic absorption improvement was the same as that of oleic , and less than that of linoleic and  acids. For rectal dosing, bioavailability was similar among various emulsions, in the range 40-50%. The effect of the emulsion incorporating oleic  or DHA on improving VCM enteral bioavailability was not increased proportional to the incorporated amount. The electrical resistance of membranes was not changed by the incorporation of various fatty acids in emulsions. Our results indicated that W/O/W emulsions incorporating C18 unsaturated fatty  or DHA were useful carriers for improving the absorption of poorly absorbable drugs via the intestinal tract without gross changes to  function.Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmaceutical Association J Pharm Sci 89:1243-1252, 2000.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8058607>Alveolar permeability enhancement by oleic  and related fatty acids: evidence for a calcium-dependent mechanism.</a></h1><p>Pulmonary exposure to oleic  (OA) is associated with permeability alterations and cellular damage; however, the exact relationship between these two effects has not been clearly established. Using cultured alveolar epithelial monolayers, we demonstrated that OA and some other fatty acids (< or = 50 microM) can induce permeability changes without detectable cellular damage. At higher concentrations, however, OA caused severe membrane damage and leakage to solute flux. The permeability enhancing effect of OA was observed with both the paracellular marker 3H-mannitol and the lipophilic transcellular indicator 14C-progesterone. While the effect of OA on transcellular permeability may be attributed to its known effect on membrane fluidity, the paracellular promoting effect of OA and its mechanism are not well established. We postulated that OA may increase paracellular permeability through a Ca(2+)-dependent  mechanism. Using dual-excitation fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrated that OA can increase intracellular calcium, [Ca2+]i, in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was transient at low OA concentrations (< or = 50 microM) but became more pronounced and sustained at higher concentrations. Free hydroxyl and unsaturated groups were required for this activation since esterified OA (oleic methyl ester) and stearic  (a saturated fatty  with equal chain length) had much reduced effects on both the [Ca2+]i and the permeability alterations. Degree of unsaturation was unimportant since  (18:3), linoleic  (18:2), and OA (18:1) had similar and comparable effects on the two parameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20037486>Barrier functionality and transport machineries of human ECV304 cells.</a></h1><p>The lack of a brain-derived endothelial cell-based model has led researchers to exploit non-brain endothelial/epithelial cells as in vitro models for blood-brain barrier (BBB) investigations. Of these, the endothelial-like human ECV304 cell line was initially characterized as endothelial cells and has been widely used as an in vitro BBB model. It was later shown to be T24 bladder carcinoma epithelial cells. To pursue its potential as a cell-based model for drug screening and transport machineries, ECV304 cells were evaluated for their barrier and plasma membrane characteristics.ECV304 cells treated with some  modulators (e.g. cAMP elevators, butyric , dexamethasone, gamma-, and astrocytic factors) were examined for bioelectrical resistance, transcellular/paracellular permeability, and functionality expression of some key transporters.A significant (p<0.05) increase in trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) was observed in ECV304 cells treated with astrocytic factors and cAMP elevators (i.e. to approximately 110Omega*cm2 vs. approximately 60 Omega*cm2 in the control). Such treatment also yielded high discrimination in the permeability coefficients of the transcellular marker propranolol (25x10-6 cm/sec) and the paracellular marker sucrose (11.3 x 10-6 cm/sec). Carrier-mediated transporters such as GLUT-1, system L, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) as well as endocytic transport machineries (e.g. clathrin and caveolin) were found to be functionally expressed.ECV304 cells failed to generate a discriminative  barrier even in the presence of  modulators. Thus their implementation in drug permeability screening is not recommended. They display some important key carrier-mediated transport systems and can be considered as a useful cell-based in vitro model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12591548>Effect of gamma- or docosahexaenoic  on  permeability in intestinal monolayer cells and their mechanism by protein kinase C activation and/or eicosanoid formation.</a></h1><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids have been characterized as immunonutrients, but the effect of gamma- (GLA) or docosahexaenoic  (DHA) on intestinal permeability has rarely been reported.Confluent Caco-2 cells on porous filter were used to measure  function by fluorescein sulfonic  permeability and transepithelial electrical resistance. Treatments with 0, 10, 50, and 100 microM of GLA or DHA during 24 h were compared. Then the effects of butylated hydroxytoluene (antioxidant), 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (protein kinase C antagonist), and inhibitors of enzymatic degradation to the eicosanoids, indomethacin (cyclooxygenase inhibitor) and 2-(12-hydroxydodeca-5,10-diynyl)-3,5,6-trimethyl-p-benzoquinone (lipoxygenase inhibitor), on GLA or DHA were examined.GLA and DHA enhanced fluorescein sulfonic  permeability to 8.7- and 1.4-fold, respectively, and lowered transepithelial electrical resistance to 0.52- and 0.73-fold, respectively, versus the control in a concentration-dependent manner without cell injury (P < 0.001 to 0.05). Indomethacin and 2-(12-hydroxydodeca-5,10-diynyl)-3,5,6-trimethyl-p-benzoquinone enhanced the changes mediated by GLA but did not alter the DHA effect. Butylated hydroxytoluene was ineffective. 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine facilitated the changes mediated by GLA, DHA, and eicosapentaenoic . The results indicated that the mechanism to change  permeability via protein kinase C regulation is common but that via eicosanoid formation differs among GLA, DHA, and eicosapentaenoic .GLA and DHA affect  permeability in intestinal monolayer cells specifically and in a concentration-dependent manner.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653193>Effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids on postnatal ileum development using the fat-1 transgenic mouse model.</a></h1><p>Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) play a critical role in neonatal health. We hypothesized that LCPUFAs play an essential role in priming postnatal gut development. We studied the effect of LCPUFAs on postnatal gut development using fat-1 transgenic mice, which are capable of converting n-6 to n-3 LCPUFAs, and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice.Distal ileum sections were collected from fat-1 and WT mice on days 3, 14, and 28. Fatty  analyses, histology, RT-qPCR and intestinal permeability were performed.Fat-1 mice, relative to WT mice, showed increased n-3 LCPUFAs levels (α-, docosahexaenoic , and eicosapentaenoic , p < 0.05) and decreased arachidonic  levels (p < 0.05) in the ileum. Preweaning fat-1 mice, compared to WT, showed >50% reduced muc2, Tff3, TLR9, and Camp expression (p < 0.05), markers of the innate immune response. There was a >two-fold increased expression of Fzd5 and EphB2, markers of cell differentiation (p < 0.05), and Fabp2 and 6, regulators of fatty  transport and metabolism (p < 0.05). Despite reduced expression of  genes, intestinal permeability in fat-1 was comparable to WT mice.Our data support the hypothesis that fatty  profiles early in development modulate intestinal gene expression in formative domains, such as cell differentiation, , other innate host defenses, and lipid metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9514943>Regulation of  permeability and occludin expression by polyunsaturated fatty acids.</a></h1><p> (TJ) are the topical most structure in epithelial and endothelial cells and play a key role in the control of permeability and prevention of tumour cell invasion of endothelium. In this study we examined the effects of a range of polyunsaturated fatty acids on the function of TJs and the expression of occludin, a key molecule in the TJs of the human vascular endothelial cell line, ECV304. Treatment of the endothelial cells with gamma , an anti-cancer PUFA, increased the transendothelial cell resistance (TER) and reduced the paracellular permeability to large molecules. The effects were seen without any changes in the viability of the endothelial cells. Occludin, a recently identified molecule, which plays a major role in  was up-regulated by this fatty  as revealed by both Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Other fatty acids were also tested. Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) also exerted an up-regulatory effect, but LA and AA down-regulated the expression. We conclude that GLA and EPA which also have other anti-cancer effects, regulate the expression of occludin in endothelial cells and thus contribute to the modification of the TER of these cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24524826>Enhancing the intestinal absorption of low molecular weight chondroitin sulfate by conjugation with α- and the transport mechanism of the conjugates.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this report was to demonstrate the effect of amphiphilic polysaccharides-based self-assembling micelles on enhancing the oral absorption of low molecular weight chondroitin sulfate (LMCS) in vitro and in vivo, and identify the transepithelial transport mechanism of LMCS micelles across the intestinal barrier. α--low molecular weight chondroitin sulfate polymers(α-LNA-LMCS) were successfully synthesized, and characterized by FTIR, (1)HNMR, TGA/DSC, TEM, laser light scattering and zeta potential. The significant oral absorption enhancement and elimination half-life (t₁/₂) extension of LNA-LMCS2 in rats were evidenced by intragastric administration in comparison with CS and LMCS. Caco-2 transport studies demonstrated that the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) of LNA-LMCS2 was significantly higher than that of CS and LMCS (p<0.001), and no significant effects on the overall integrity of the monolayer were observed during the transport process. In addition, α-LNA-LMCS micelles accumulated around the cell membrane and intercellular space observed by confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). Furthermore, evident alterations in the F-actin cytoskeleton were detected by CLSM observation following the treatment of the cell monolayers with α-LNA-LMCS micelles, which further certified the capacity of α-LNA-LMCS micelles to open the intercellular  rather than disrupt the overall integrity of the monolayer. Therefore, LNA-LMCS2 with low cytotoxicity and high bioavailability might be a promising substitute for CS in clinical use, such as treating osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis, etc.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The NVU is comprised of endothelial cells that are interconnected by  resting on a parenchymal basement membrane ensheathed by pericytes, smooth muscle cells and a layer of astrocyte end feet. Circulating blood cells, such as leukocytes, complete the NVU. BBB disruption is common in several neurological diseases, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. We analyzed the role of TWIK-related potassium channel-1 (TREK1, encoded by KCNK2) in human and mouse endothelial cells and the BBB. TREK1 was downregulated in endothelial cells by treatment with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Blocking TREK1 increased leukocyte transmigration, whereas TREK1 activation had the opposite effect. We identified altered mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling, actin remodeling and upregulation of cellular adhesion molecules as potential mechanisms of increased migration in TREK1-deficient (Kcnk2(-/-)) cells. In Kcnk2(-/-) mice, brain endothelial cells showed an upregulation of the cellular adhesion molecules ICAM1, VCAM1 and PECAM1 and facilitated leukocyte trafficking into the CNS. Following the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by immunization with a myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG)35-55 peptide, Kcnk2(-/-) mice showed higher EAE severity scores that were accompanied by increased cellular infiltrates in the central nervous system (CNS). The severity of EAE was attenuated in mice given the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis drug riluzole or fed a diet enriched with linseed oil (which contains the TREK-1 activating omega-3 fatty  α-). These beneficial effects were reduced in Kcnk2(-/-) mice, suggesting TREK-1 activating compounds may be used therapeutically to treat diseases related to BBB dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17243118>Enhanced  function in human breast cancer cells by antioxidant, selenium and polyunsaturated lipid.</a></h1><p>Paracellular permeability (PCP) is governed by  (TJs) in epithelial cells, acting as cell-cell adhesion structures, the aberration of which is known to be linked to the dissociation and metastasis of breast cancer cells. This study hypothesized that the function of TJs in human breast cancer cells can be augmented by gamma  (GLA), selenium (Se), and iodine (I) in the presence of 17-beta-estradiol, as these molecules are known to increase TJ functions in endothelial cells, using assays of trans-epithelial resistance (TER), PCP, immunofluorescence, and in vitro invasion and motility models. GLA, I, and Se individually increased TER of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. The combination of all three agents also had a significant increase in TER. Addition of GLA/Se/I reduced PCP of both breast cancer cell lines. GLA/Se/I reversed the effect of 17-beta-estradiol (reduced TER, increased PCP). Immunofluorescence revealed that after treatment with Se/I/GLA over 24 h, there was increasing relocation to breast cancer cell-cell  of occludin and ZO-1 in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, treatment with GLA/Se/I, alone or in combination, significantly reduced in vitro invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells through an endothelial cell barrier (P < 0.0001) and reduced 17-beta-estradiol induced breast cancer cell motility (P < 0.0001). Our previous work has demonstrated that GLA, I, and Se alone, or in combination are able to strengthen the function of TJs in human endothelial cells; this has now proved to be true of human breast cancer cells.

Fish were fed diets with different ALA/LNA ratios (0.01, 0.34, 0.68, 1.03, 1.41, 1.76 and 2.15) for 60 days. The present results showed that ALA/LNA ratio of 1.03 significantly enhanced lysozyme and  phosphatase activities, complement 3 contents, promoted mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides (Hepcidin and liver expression antimicrobial peptide-2), anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 10 and transforming growth factor β1) and inhibitor protein κBα, whereas suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1β, interleukin 8, tumor necrosis factor a and interferon γ2), and signal molecules (IκB kinase β, IκB kines γ and nuclear factor κB p65) mRNA levels in the gill, indicating that optimal dietary ALA/LNA ratio improve gill immunity of juvenile fish. Besides, ALA/LNA ratio of 1.03 increased mRNA levels of the barrier functional proteins (occludin, zonula occludens-1, claudin-b, -c and -3), and reduced the pore-formation proteins (claudin-15a) and myosin light-chain kinase mRNA abundance in the gill of juvenile grass carp, indicating optimum ALA/LNA ratio strengthen gill  of juvenile fish.

Interestingly, dietary ALA/LNA ratios had no effect on IκB kinase α and catalase activities in fish gills. Collectively, optimal dietary ALA/LNA ratio could improve gill immunity and strengthen physical barrier of juvenile fish.
