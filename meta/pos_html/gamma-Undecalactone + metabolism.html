<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24041533>The impact of surface loading and dosing scheme on the skin uptake of fragrances.</a></h2><p>This study compared the skin uptake of γ-undecalactone, decanol, and dodecyl acetate in an in vitro, un-occluded penetration assay in which they were applied to porcine skin at different finite loadings and application schemes. The pattern of fractional uptake differed between the chemicals and did not show the often assumed inverse correlation with surface loading. Furthermore, the mass uptake of identical cumulative amounts of the chemicals was not always additive. These results show that the uptake of fragrances in absence of occlusion and at finite loadings is chemical-specific and depends on the surface loading, the application scheme, and most probably, on the effects of the chemicals on the skin barrier efficiency. The observed lack of additivity might explain some of the differences in the responses observed in patch and repeated open application tests, and the boosting of the allergic state in sensitized individuals by sub-clinical exposures.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The models built upon previously developed self-assembled lipid membranes which have composition and 3D organization similar to those of the lipid matrix in SC. In one model the target chemicals were incorporated in the lipids before their self-assembly, and in the other one they were applied on top of a preformed lipid membrane. The chemicals could be incorporated within the model membranes in quantities close to those reached within human SC upon heavy surface loading. The dose-dependent effects of the chemicals on the lateral molecular organization in the models were qualitatively identical to those observed by infrared spectroscopy in human SC. The models facilitated the interpretation of X-ray diffraction profiles used to determine the nature of the interactions between the chemicals and the lipid lamellae and the position of the exogenous molecules within the unit cell of the lipid phases. These model systems are suitable for in vitro studies in the areas of skin biophysics, dermatology, transdermal drug delivery, and risk assessment.© 2013.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12174611>[Study on difference in olfactory response in dysosmia patients].</a></h2><p>Using 1952 dysosmia patients, we studied the difference in olfactory response to 5 types of odorous substances used in the standard olfactory acuity test in Japan--beta-phenyl ethyl alcohol, methyl cyclopentenolone, isovaleric acid, , and scatol. Olfactory dysfunctions included 887 patients with chronic paranasal sinusitis, 255 with allergic rhinitis, 326 with common cold sequela, 77 with complications from head injuries, 28 with drug-induced dysosmia, 39 with congenital dysosmia, 257 with dysosmia of unknown etiology, and 83 miscellaneous. The standard olfactory acuity test before treatment indicated that 82 patients detected only one odor within the detection threshold and 157 within the recognition threshold; 40 responded only to isovaleric acid at the detection threshold and 101 at the recognition threshold. Both figures were significantly greater than those who responded to other odors (p < 0.01). No specific trends were noted in etiologies of dysosmia that allowed smelling of isovaleric acid only either at the detection or recognition threshold. Among those whose olfactory thresholds were judged to be scaled out against all 5 odorous substances, 552 were rated as scaled out at the detection threshold and 630 at the recognition threshold. During post treatment, 33 scaled out at the detection threshold and 32 scaled out at the recognition threshold improved enough to smell 1 type of odor. Of these, 15 scaled out at the detection threshold and 13 scaled out at the recognition threshold became able to smell only isovaleric acid. Those becoming able to smell only isovaleric acid either at the detection or recognition threshold, significantly outnumbered those becoming able to smell other odors (p < 0.01). No outstanding cause of dysosmia was seen in those able to smell isovaleric acid. This data indicates that olfactory function for detecting isovaleric acid is relatively resistant to disease and is most likely to be restored. The difference in olfactory response of patients with olfactory dysfunction such as those above may be due to variations in the number of olfactory receptor proteins for specific odors within olfactory cells or different responses to the type of molecules of odor-emitting substances.</p></html>
