<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3020581>Essential  acid deficiency: a new look at an old problem.</a></h2><p>Essential  acid (EFA) deficiency is a useful tool to study the role of arachidonate and its metabolites in various physiologic and pathologic states. Recent studies have clarified the effects of EFA deficiency on membrane arachidonate and its metabolites, and have demonstrated that 20:3(n-9) (which accumulates in EFA deficiency) can be metabolized to a variety of eicosanoids. EFA deficiency has been shown to exert an anti-inflammatory effect. The mechanism of this effect may in part be mediated through a decrease in leukocyte leukotriene formation. In contrast, studies using the novel  acid, columbinic acid, have shown that the epidermal dysfunction seen in EFA deficiency may be a function of linoleate and its lipoxygenase metabolites rather than of arachidonate and the prostaglandins. Finally, it has recently been shown that EFA deficiency potentiates the effects of volatile anesthetics. EFA deficiency may thus provide a useful tool to investigate the molecular mechanism of these drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6092909>Effect of  acids of omega 6 series on the biosynthesis of arachidonic acid in HTC cells.</a></h2><p>The influence of the preincubation of HTC cells with  acids of omega 6 series and columbinic acid (5t, 9c, 12c 18:3) on the biosynthesis of arachidonic acid was studied. The cells were incubated on a chemically defined medium with or without the addition of unlabeled linoleic, gamma-linolenic, eicosatrienoic, arachidonic, docosatetraenoic, docosapentaenoic and columbinic acids. After 24 hr of preincubation in the presence of the aforementioned  acids, [1-14C]eicosa-8,11,14-trienoic acid was added to the culture medium as the only lipidic source. Twenty-four hours later the synthesis of arachidonic acid and the  acid composition of the cells were determined. At 20 microM concentration the omega 6  acids studied except docosapentaenoic acid produced an increase on the biosynthesis of arachidonic acid compared to the cells incubated in the absence of unlabeled  acids in the medium. The  acids added to the culture medium were incorporated into the cells and modified their  acid composition. Columbinic acid, with a similar structure to linoleic acid, also produced a significant increase on the conversion of eicosatrienoic acid to arachidonic acid. These results would suggest that the effect of both, linoleic and columbinic acids, may be adscribed to their configuration and not necessarily to their transformation in higher homologs, since columbinic acid is unable to be desaturated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9748638>Methylene-interrupted double bond in polyunsaturated  acid is an essential structure for metabolism by the  acid chain elongation system of rat .</a></h2><p>Some plant oils contain non-methylene-interrupted polyunsaturated  acids (NMIFAs).  (all cis delta-5,9,12/18:3) and columbinic acid (trans,cis,cis delta-5,9,12/18:3) are NMIFAs that exist in pine seed oil and columbine seed oil, respectively. We investigated the double bond position of  acid recognized by the  acid chain elongation system (FACES) of rat  using NMIFAs as experimental tools. In the total elongation assay, amounts of C2 unit chain-elongated metabolites of  and columbinic acid were 32% and 11%, respectively, compared to that of gamma-linolenic (all cis delta-6,9,12/18:3) as the substrate. In the condensation reaction assay, the rate limiting step of FACES, the conversion rates of  and columbinic acid to the corresponding C20 beta-keto  acids were 19% and 9% of that of gamma-linolenic acid, respectively. The formation of elongated metabolite of podocarpic acid (all cis delta-5,11,14/20:3) was only 7% of that of arachidonic acid (all cis delta-5,8,11,14/20:4). From these results it was concluded that the condensing enzyme of FACES could recognize the methylene-interrupted cis double bond structure vicinal to the carboxyl group in the  acid molecule.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27084371> Downregulates Lipid Anabolic Pathway in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Pine nut oil (PNO) was reported to reduce lipid accumulation in the . However, the specific effect of  (18:3, all-cis-Δ5,9,12), a unique component of PNO, on lipid metabolism has not been studied. We hypothesized that  downregulates the lipid anabolic pathway in HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were incubated in serum-free medium supplemented with 50 μM bovine serum albumin (BSA), palmitic acid, oleic acid, γ-linolenic acid, , eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), or α-linolenic acid for 24 h. Lipid accumulation was determined by Oil Red O (ORO) staining. The mRNA levels of genes related to  acid biosynthesis (SREBP1c, FAS, SCD1, and ACC1),  acid oxidation (ACC2, PPARα, CPT1A, and ACADL), cholesterol synthesis (SREBP2 and HMGCR), and lipoprotein uptake (LDLr) and of genes that may be involved in the downregulation of the lipogenic pathway (ACSL3, ACSL4, and ACSL5) were determined by qPCR. LDLR protein levels were measured by Western blot analysis. The mRNA levels of SREBP1c, FAS, and SCD1 were significantly downregulated by  treatment compared to BSA control (53, 54, and 38 % lower, respectively). In addition, the mRNA levels of HMGCR, ACSL3, and LDLr were significantly lower (30, 30, and 43 % lower, respectively), and ACSL4 tended to be lower in the  group (20 % lower, P = 0.082) relative to the control group. In conclusion,  downregulated the lipid anabolic pathway in HepG2 cells by reducing expression of genes related to lipid synthesis, lipoprotein uptake, and the regulation of the lipogenic pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7826999>Influence of Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis)-seed oil containing cis-5,cis-9,cis-12-octadecatrienoic acid on polyunsaturated  acid metabolism, eicosanoid production and blood pressure of rats.</a></h2><p>The effects of dietary Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis)-seed oil containing a peculiar trienoic acid (cis-5,cis-9,cis-12-18:3, , approximately 18%) on various lipid variables were compared in rats with those of flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) oil, safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) oil and evening primrose (Oenothera biennis L.) oil under experimental conditions where the effects of different polyunsaturated  acids could be estimated. In Sprague-Dawley rats fed on diets containing 100 g fat and 5 g cholesterol/kg, the hypocholesterolaemic activity of  was intermediate between alpha-linolenic and linoleic acids. Analysis of the  acid composition of  phosphatidylcholine indicated that, in contrast to alpha-linolenic acid,  does not interfere with the desaturation of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid. However, the effects on ADP-induced platelet aggregation and aortic prostacyclin production were comparable. When spontaneously hypertensive rats were fed on diets containing 100 g fat/kg but free of cholesterol, gamma-linolenic and pinolenic acids, as compared with linoleic acid, increased prostacyclin production and tended to reduce platelet aggregation. In addition,  attenuated the elevation of blood pressure after 5 weeks of feeding. Thus, the results of the present studies indicate the beneficial effects of  on various lipid variables.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8951990>Effects of gamma-linolenic acid and its positional isomer  on immune parameters of brown-Norway rats.</a></h2><p>Male Brown-Norway rats given purified diets containing safflower oil (SFO, linoleic acid, 18:2 n-6), evening primrose oil (EPO, gamma-linolenic acid, 6,9,12- 18:3 n-6) or Korean pine seed oil (PSO, 5,9,12- 18:3) at the 10% level were immunized twice with intraperitoneal ovalbumin, on days 14 and 35 of the feeding diets, and killed one day after the second booster. The relative population of CD4+ T-lymphocytes in the spleen was significantly lower in rats fed SFO than in those fed EPO or PSO, while that of CD8+ subsets remained unchanged. There was a significant increase in the splenic production of IgG and IgE in the PSO group compared to the SFO group, while EPO significantly increased IgE. The periodical response patterns of the serum levels of IgG and IgE varied depending on the source of dietary fats, and the initial rise of total immunoglobulins tended to be higher in the EPO group. The release by peritoneal exudate cells of histamine was comparable among three groups irrespective of saturation by calcium ionophore A23187, while PSO significantly increased leukotriene B4 production. These observations not only indicate specific roles of gamma-linolenic acid but also diverse influences of different octadecatrienoic acids in various immune measurements.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3337831>Metabolism of 6,9,12-octadecatrienoic acid and 6,9,12,15-octadecatetraenoic acid by rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>When 5.10(6) hepatocytes were incubated for 40 min with 0.015-0.3 mM (1-14C)-labeled 6,9,12-octadecatrienoic acid or (1-14C)-labeled 6,9,12,15-octadecatetraenoic acid there was a concentration-dependent acylation of radioactive metabolites into both phospholipids and triacylglycerol. However, when the concentration of either substrate exceeded 60-150 microM there was no further increase in the metabolism of either substrate to longer-chain (n-6) and (n-3) acids. When cells were then incubated for various periods of time with 60 microM substrate there was initial rapid removal of the substrate which was accompanied by its acylation into lipids. Over time, the amount of both substrates in lipids declined without an overall drop in specific activity. This decline was accompanied by an increase in long-chain (n-6) and (n-3)  acids. Similar results were obtained when the time-dependent metabolism of the two substrates was examined in individual hepatocyte phospholipids. Collectively, these findings suggest that when these two 18-carbon acids are produced by desaturation of dietary linoleate and linolenate that they are in part initially acylated into a labile phospholipid pool. Rapid release and subsequent further metabolism to longer-chain (n-6) and (n-3) acids may explain why these products of the 6-desaturase do not accumulate in membrane lipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3632215>Effect of dietary columbinic acid on the  acid composition and physical membrane properties of different tissues of EFA-deficient rats.</a></h2><p>The effect of columbinic acid (5 trans, 9 cis, 12 cis, octadeca-trienoic acid) supplemented to a fat-free diet on the  acid composition and its correlation to the physical properties of several tissues of rats, was studied. The absence of lipids in the diet produced the typical changes in the  acid composition characteristic of essential  acid (EFA) deficiency, namely a significant increase in the relative percentage of monoenoic  acids with a concomitant decrease in linoleic and arachidonic acids and a rise in eicosa-5,8,11-trienoic acid in , kidney, lung and spleen homogenates. Columbinic acid supplemented to a fat-free diet for 24 or 48 hr was incorporated into the different tissues and was partially elongated to 7 trans, 11 cis, 14 cis eicosatrienoic acid, but it was not desaturated. It modified the  acid spectrum of the lipids in the different tissues returning it to a similar composition of non-EFA deficient animals, except for a decrease of linoleic acid. The absence of lipids in the diet produced an increase in the 1-6 diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) steady-state fluorescence anisotropy (rs) in  microsomes, that was corrected by the administration of columbinic acid for 24 hr. It is concluded that columbinic acid produced a change in the pattern of total  acid composition of the different tissues studied which induced a favorable effect on the physical properties of the  microsomal membranes (rs), leading to an improvement on the  acid deficiency in those membranes. Besides, columbinic acid would also exert a favorable effect in the short term, but not in the long-term eicosanoids production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7475992>Octadecatrienoic acids as the substrates for the key enzymes in glycerolipid biosynthesis and  acid oxidation in rat .</a></h2><p>The activities of key enzymes in glycerolipid biosynthesis and  acid oxidation were compared using CoA esters of naturally occurring positional isomers of octadecatrienoic acids (18:3) as the substrates. The trienoic acids employed were 9,12,15-18:3 (alpha-18:3), 6,9,12-18:3 (gamma-18:3), and 5,9,12-18:3 ( which is a  acid contained in pine seed oil, po-18:3). The activities of microsomal glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase obtained with various 18:3 were only slightly lower than or comparable with those obtained with palmitic (16:0), oleic (18:1), and linoleic (18:2) acids. Mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase was exclusively specific for saturated  acyl-CoA. The activities of microsomal diacylglycerol acyltransferase measured with various polyunsaturated  acyl-CoAs were significantly lower than those obtained with 16:0- and 18:1-CoAs. Among the polyunsaturated  acids, gamma-18:3 gave the distinctly low activity. The Vmax values of the mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase I were significantly higher with alpha-18:3 and po-18:3 but not gamma-18:3, than with 16:0 and 18:2, while the apparent Km values were the same irrespective of the types of acyl-CoA used except for the distinctly low value obtained with gamma-18:3. The response to an inhibitor of the acyltransferase reaction, malonyl-CoA, was appreciably exaggerated with 18:2, alpha-18:3, and po-18:3 more than with 16:0 and 18:1. However, the response with gamma-18:3 was the same as with 16:0. Thus, some of glycerolipid biosynthesis and  acid oxidation enzymes could discriminate not only the differences in the degree of unsaturation of  acids but also the positional distribution of double bond among the naturally occurring 18:3 acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430456> ameliorates oleic acid-induced lipogenesis and oxidative stress via AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p> (PLA), a natural compound isolated from pine nut oil, has been reported to exert bioactivity against lipid anabolism. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms still poorly elucidated. The aim of this study is to comprehensively demonstrate the effects of PLA on oleic acid (OA)-induced non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and their relationship with the lipid metabolic regulation. The results demonstrated that treatment with PLA dramatically inhibited lipid accumulation, oxidative stress as well as inflammatory responses induced by oleic acid in HepG2 cells. PLA also obviously decreased the levels of cellular triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). As well as PLA stilled promoted the antioxidant enzymes activity including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). Furthermore, PLA could increase the expressions of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase1 (HO-1) to alleviate oxidative damage. It also could reduce lipogenesis-related transcription factors expression, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1c),  acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). PLA treatment resulted in increasing phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) expression. However, pretreatment with compound C (inhibitor of AMPK) inhibited the effect of PLA on promoting the expression of p-AMPK, SIRT1 and PPARα for lipolysis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PLA possessed the potential to prevent lipid accumulation in OA-induced HepG2 cells via upregulating the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway, which supported the development of new drug candidate against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.
