Progesterone based contraceptives are thought to be safer in this regard. The effect of Norplant, a  contraceptive implant, on liver function was evaluated in 149 Bangladeshi women of reproductive age in this study. Liver function tests and ultrasonography of hepato-biliary system were done before and after the implantation. The patients were followed upto two years. There were non-significant transient rise of serum bilirubin and slight enlargement of liver during the first year. There was no significant change in the levels of AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin-globulin ratio and prothrombin time. The results suggest that Norplant has no adverse effect on liver function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21543785>The mechanisms of propofol-induced vascular relaxation and modulation by perivascular adipose tissue and endothelium.</a></h2><p>Propofol causes hypotension due to relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells through its direct or indirect vasodilator effects. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and endothelium attenuate vascular contraction, and the function of PVAT is altered in hypertension and . Whether PVAT affects the action of anesthetics on vascular function is unknown. We studied the mechanisms of propofol-induced relaxation in relation to the involvement of PVAT and endothelium.Thoracic aortic rings from Wistar rats were prepared with or without PVAT (PVAT+ and PVAT-), intact endothelium (E+), or both, or with the endothelium removed (E-) for functional studies.In phenylephrine precontracted vessels, propofol-induced relaxation was highest with both PVAT and E+ and lowest in vessels denuded of both PVAT and endothelium. Propofol-induced relaxation occurred via both endothelium-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The relaxation response induced by propofol was significantly reduced by nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (l-NNA), K(+) channel blockers (tetraethylammonium and glibenclamide) in E+ and E- vessels, and by soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H-(1,2,4) oxadiazolo (4,3-A) quinazoline-1-one and hydrogen peroxide scavenger (catalase) in E- vessels. The presence of PVAT significantly enhanced the relaxation response induced by propofol. In contrast to phenylephrine precontracted vessels in which the presence of PVAT or endothelium had an effect, in vessels precontracted with KCl, propofol-induced relaxation was similar among the 4 types of vessel preparation.PVAT enhances the relaxation effect induced by propofol in rat aorta through both endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent pathways thus highlighting the clinical importance of PVAT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9678138>Contraception guidance in women with pre-existing disturbances in carbohydrate metabolism.</a></h2><p>To review our studies on the clinical and metabolic impact of contraceptive methods in women with insulin dependent  (IDDM) and women with previous gestational  (GDM) in order to provide suggestions for the contraceptive counselling of these women.The clinical events following first insertions of copper IUDs were studied in 103 women with IDDM and in 119 non-diabetic women. Moreover we studied the effects on glycometabolic control and lipid metabolism in women with well-controlled IDDM using low-dose oral contraceptives (OCs) containing ethinylestradiol combined with norethisterone (n = 10),  (n = 9) or gestodene (n = 11). Hemostatic and endothelial function was also studied in the women using the gestodene-containing preparation. Finally, we studied the impact of oral contraceptives on the insulin sensitivity in women with previous GDM.The continuation rates and indications for medical removal of the IUDs were similar in the diabetic and the non-diabetic women. There was no increased pregnancy rate or increased frequency of pelvic inflammatory disease in the diabetic women. The glycemic control was not changed by the OCs and none of the treatment regimens were associated with changes in plasma lipids linked to increased risk of atherosclerosis. Indications of increased fibrin formation, which seemed to be compensated by increased fibrinolytic activity, were noted with the gestodene-containing preparation. None of the women developed microalbuminuria during the study. Compared to normal women, we found reduced insulin sensitivity in the women with previous GDM using the pill.Intrauterine devices and barrier methods can be used by diabetic women with the same reservations as in the general population. Low-dose OCs do not influence the glycemic control and have no adverse impact on plasma lipids. The balance between fibrin formation and resolution was maintained during intake of the gestodene-containing pill. Our findings suggest that combined oral contraceptives can be used in women with uncomplicated IDDM and in women with previous GDM if clinical and metabolic monitoring can be ensured.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29077194>Metformin for endometrial hyperplasia.</a></h2><p>Endometrial cancer is one of the most common gynaecological cancers in the world. Rates of endometrial cancer are rising, in part because of rising obesity rates. Endometrial hyperplasia is a precancerous condition in women that can lead to endometrial cancer if left untreated. Endometrial hyperplasia occurs more commonly than endometrial cancer. Progesterone tablets currently used to treat women with endometrial hyperplasia are associated with adverse effects in up to 84% of women. The  intrauterine device (Mirena Coil, Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Whippany, NJ, USA) may improve compliance, but it is invasive, is not acceptable to all women, and is associated with irregular vaginal bleeding in 82% of cases. Therefore, an alternative treatment for women with endometrial hyperplasia is needed. Metformin, a drug that is often used to treat people with diabetes, has been shown in some human studies to reverse endometrial hyperplasia. However, the effectiveness and safety of metformin for treatment of endometrial hyperplasia remain uncertain.To determine the effectiveness and safety of metformin in treating women with endometrial hyperplasia.We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, Google Scholar, OpenGrey, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), and two trials registers from inception to 10 January 2017. We searched the bibliographies of all included studies and reviews on this topic. We also handsearched the conference abstracts of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) 2015 and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) 2015.We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cross-over trials comparing metformin (used alone or in combination with other medical therapies) versus placebo or no treatment, any conventional medical treatment, or any other active intervention for women with histologically confirmed endometrial hyperplasia of any type.Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, extracted data from included studies, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We resolved disagreements by discussion or by deferment to a third review author. When study details were missing, review authors contacted study authors. The primary outcome of this review was regression of endometrial hyperplasia histology (with or without atypia) towards normal histology. Secondary outcome measures included recurrence of endometrial hyperplasia, progression of endometrial hyperplasia to endometrial cancer, hysterectomy rate, abnormal uterine bleeding, health-related quality of life, and adverse effects during treatment.We included three RCTs in which a total of 77 women took part. We rated the quality of the evidence as very low for all outcomes owing to very serious risk of bias (associated with poor reporting, attrition, and limitations in study design) and imprecision.We performed a meta-analysis of two trials with 59 participants. When metformin was compared with megestrol acetate in women with endometrial hyperplasia, we found insufficient evidence to determine whether there were differences between groups for the following outcomes: regression of endometrial hyperplasia histology towards normal histology (odds ratio (OR) 3.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 11.57, two RCTs, n = 59, very low-quality evidence), hysterectomy rates (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.05 to 15.52, two RCTs, n = 59, very low-quality evidence), and rates of abnormal uterine bleeding (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.05 to 15.52, two RCTs, n = 44 , very low-quality evidence). We found no data for recurrence of endometrial hyperplasia or health-related quality of life. Both studies (n = 59) provided data on progression of endometrial hyperplasia to endometrial cancer as well as one (n = 16) reporting some adverse effects in the metformin arm, notably nausea, thrombosis, lactic acidosis, abnormal liver and renal function among others.Another trial including 16 participants compared metformin plus megestrol acetate versus megestrol acetate alone in women with endometrial hyperplasia. We found insufficient evidence to determine whether there were differences between groups for the following outcomes: regression of endometrial hyperplasia histology towards normal histology (OR 9.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 86.52, one RCT, n = 16, very low-quality evidence), recurrence of endometrial hyperplasia among women who achieve regression (OR not estimable, no events recorded, one RCT, n = 8, very low-quality evidence), progression of endometrial hyperplasia to endometrial cancer (OR not estimable, no events recorded, one RCT, n = 13, very low-quality evidence), or hysterectomy rates (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.37, one RCT, n = 16, very low-quality evidence). Investigators provided no data on abnormal uterine bleeding or health-related quality of life. In terms of adverse effects, three of eight participants (37.5%) in the metformin plus megestrol acetate study arm reported nausea.At present, evidence is insufficient to support or refute the use of metformin alone or in combination with standard therapy - specifically, megestrol acetate - versus megestrol acetate alone, for treatment of endometrial hyperplasia. Robustly designed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials yielding long-term outcome data are needed to address this clinical question.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1424624>Carbohydrate metabolism before and after Norplant removal.</a></h2><p>Changes in carbohydrate metabolism, measured by oral glucose tolerance test, were studied in Norplant users before and after removal. The mean area under the glucose curve rose from 24.7 min mmol/L before Norplant insertion to 35.1 min mmol/L before removal and decreased to 26.1 min mmol/L four weeks after Norplant removal. The areas before insertion and after removal were not statistically different (95% confidence interval -3.3 to 0.56, P = 0.16). The mean areas under the insulin curves before insertion (53.14 min uU/L) and after removal (59.46 min uU/L), however, were significantly different (95% confidence interval -7.64 to -5.0, P less than 0.0001). We conclude that changes in carbohydrate metabolism induced by Norplant are reversible once the implants are removed. While the changes in glucose induced by Norplant returned to pre-insertion levels within 4 weeks after removal, insulin changes were slower to return to pre-insertion values.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30123261>Low-Dose Spironolactone-Pioglitazone-Metformin Normalizes Circulating Fetuin-A Concentrations in Adolescent Girls with Polycystic Ovary .</a></h2><p>Fetuin-A is a glycoprotein produced in the liver and related to ; fetuin-A secretion is divergently regulated in different pathological conditions. In girls with polycystic ovary  (PCOS), insulin sensitization results in a more favorable endocrine- outcome than oral contraception; we assessed whether those differences are underscored by changes in circulating fetuin-A.Fetuin-A concentration endocrine- markers and hepatovisceral fat were measured longitudinally in 35 PCOS girls [age, 16 yr; body mass index (BMI), 23 kg/m] randomized to receive either oral contraception [ethinylestradiol- ( = 18)] or a low-dose combination of spironolactone, pioglitazone, and metformin (SPIOMET,  = 17) over 12 months. Healthy adolescent girls (age- and BMI-matched) were used as controls ( = 25).Pretreatment fetuin-A serum levels in PCOS girls were lower than those in controls. After 12 months on treatment, fetuin-A raised to control levels only in the SPIOMET subgroup ( = 0.009, versus oral contraception); this increase was paralleled by a healthier  profile with less hepatic fat (by MRI); baseline serum fetuin-A as well as the changes over 12 months was inversely related to hepatic adiposity.A low-dose combination of insulin sensitizers and an antiandrogen-but not oral contraception-normalizes fetuin-A levels in adolescent girls with PCOS.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the impact of POC use on cardiometabolic outcomes including venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension and diabetes. Methods and results Nineteen observational studies (seven cohort and 12 case-control) were included in this systematic review. Of those, nine studies reported the risk of venous thromboembolism, six reported the risk of myocardial infarction, six reported the risk of stroke, three reported the risk of hypertension and two studies reported the risk of developing diabetes with POC use. The pooled adjusted relative risks (RRs) for venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction and stroke for oral POC users versus non-users based on the random effects model were 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-1.62), 0.98 (95% CI 0.66-1.47) and 1.02 (95% CI 0.72-1.44), respectively. Stratified analysis by route of administration showed that injectable POC with a RR of 2.62 (95% CI 1.74-3.94), but not oral POCs (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.7-1.62), was associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. A decreased risk of venous thromboembolism in a subgroup of women using an intrauterine  device was observed with a RR of 0.53 (95% CI 0.32-0.89). No effect of POC use on blood pressure was found, but there was an indication for an increased risk of diabetes with injectable POCs, albeit non-significant. Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that oral POC use is not associated with an increased risk of developing various cardiometabolic outcomes, whereas injectable POC use might increase the risk of venous thromboembolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11929640>Oral contraceptives and venous thromboembolism: a five-year national case-control study.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to assess the influence of oral contraceptives (OCs) on the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in young women. A 5-year case-control study including all Danish hospitals was conducted. All women 15-44 years old, suffering a first ever deep venous thrombosis or a first pulmonary embolism (PE) during the period January 1, 1994, to December 30, 1998, were included. Controls were selected annually, 600 per year in 1994-1995 and 1200 per year 1996-1998. Response rates for cases and controls were 87.2% and 89.7%, respectively. After exclusion of nonvalid diagnoses, pregnant women, and women with previous thrombotic disease, 987 cases and 4054 controls were available for analysis. A multivariate, matched analysis was performed. Controls were matched to cases within 1-year age bands. Adjustment was made for confounding influence (if any) from the following variables: age, year, body mass index, length of OC use, family history of VTE, cerebral thrombosis or myocardial infarction, coagulopathies, , years of schooling, and previous birth. The risk of VTE among current users of OCs was primarily influenced by duration of use, with significantly decreasing odds ratios (OR) over time: <1 year, 7.0 (5.1-9.6); 1-5 years, 3.6 (2.7-4.8); and >5 years, 3.1 (2.5-3.8), all compared with nonusers of OCs. After adjustment for confounders, current use of OCs with second- ( or norgestimate) and third- (desogestrel or gestodene) generation progestins when compared with nonuse resulted in ORs for VTE of 2.9 (2.2-3.8) and 4.0 (3.2-4.9), respectively. After adjusting for progestin types and length of use, the risk decreased significantly with decreasing estrogen dose. With 30-40 microg as reference, 20 and 50 microg products implied ORs of 0.6 (0.4-0.9) and 1.6 (0.9-2.8), respectively (p(trend) = 0.02). After correction for duration of use and differences in estrogen dose, the third/second-generation risk ratio was 1.3 (1.0-1.8; p <0.05). In conclusion, use of OCs was associated significantly to the risk of VTE. The risk among current users was reduced by more than 50% during the first years of use. The risk increased more than 100% with increasing estrogen dose, and the difference in risk between users of third- and second-generation OCs, after correction for length of use and estrogen dose, was 33%.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7968935>[Contraception for the diabetic woman].</a></h2><p>The various contraceptive methods available today are examined here: natural methods; sterilization; intrauterine devices; oral contraceptives.

Almost all synthetic progestogens are devoid of this antimineralocorticoid (anti-MC) effect. They are unable to antagonize the salt retaining effect of estrogens. This could be one cause of weight gain and an increase in blood pressure with the use of combined oral contraceptives (OC) and, in some susceptible women, with postmenopausal estrogen/(progestogen) treatment. The purpose of this presentation is to review results of clinical studies with drospirenone (DRSP), a new progestogen developed by Schering A.G., with anti-MCR activity. DRSP is a derivative of 17-alpha-spirolactone. In rats, rabbits and in man, it is a PR-agonist and an MCR- and androgen-R antagonist with no effect on the glucocorticoid-R and the estrogen-R. In normally menstruating women, 2-3mg DRSP per day, taken from day 5 to 25 of the cycle, inhibit ovulation, lead to a mild natriuresis, and a slight compensatory activation of the renin-aldosterone system. Compared with an OC containing 30 microg ethinylestradiol (EE) and 150 microg , a combination of 3mg DRSP with 30 microg EE given over 6 months led to a slight decrease in body weight and blood pressure. The reduction in mean body weight by a combination of DRSP with EE compared with a conventional OC could be confirmed in a study over 26 months in 900 young women. The OC containing DRSP has favorable effects in patients suffering from the premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and, partly due to the antiandrogenic effect of DRSP, in those with acne vulgaris. For postmenopausal women, a combination of DRSP with estradiol has been developed with the expectation that the slight blood pressure lowering and weight reducing effects will minimize cardiovascular morbidity in patients needing hormone treatment because of hot flushes and other climacteric symptoms.DRSP, by its anti-MCR effect and its potential to slightly decrease body weight and blood pressure, shares many pharmacodynamic properties with progesterone, and it is a candidate for reducing cardiovascular morbidity in women using OCs or postmenopausal hormone treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10496299>Clinical pharmacokinetics of troglitazone.</a></h2><p>Troglitazone is a new thiazolidinedione oral antidiabetic agent approved for use to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 . It is rapidly absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of between 40 and 50%. Food increases the absorption by 30 to 80%. The pharmacokinetics of troglitazone are linear over the clinical dosage range of 200 to 600 mg once daily. The mean elimination half-life ranges from 7.6 to 24 hours, which facilitates a once daily administration regimen. The pharmacokinetics of troglitazone are similar between patients with type 2  and healthy individuals. In humans, troglitazone undergoes metabolism by sulfation, glucuronidation and oxidation to form a sulfate conjugate (M1), glucuronide conjugate (M2) and quinone metabolite (M3), respectively. M1 and M3 are the major metabolites in plasma, and M2 is a minor metabolite. Age, gender, type 2 , renal impairment, smoking and race do not appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of troglitazone and its 2 major metabolites. In patients with hepatic impairment the plasma concentrations of troglitazone, M1 and M3 increase by 30%, 4-fold, and 2-fold, respectively. Cholestyramine decreases the absorption of troglitazone by 70%. Troglitazone may enhance the activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and/or transporter(s) thereby reducing the plasma concentrations of terfenadine, cyclosporin, atorvastatin and fexofenadine. It also reduces the plasma concentrations of the oral contraceptive hormones ethinylestradiol, norethindrone and . Troglitazone does not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, glibenclamide (glyburide) or paracetamol (acetaminophen). There is no pharmacodynamic interaction between troglitazone and warfarin or alcohol (ethanol). Pharmacodynamic modelling showed that improvement in fasting glucose and triglyceride levels increased with dose from 200 to 600 mg. Knowledge of systemic troglitazone exposure within a dose group does not improve the prediction of glucose lowering response or adverse effects beyond those based on the administered dose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308416>Oral contraceptive use increases risk of inflammatory and coagulatory disorders in women with Polycystic Ovarian : An observational study.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovarian  (PCOS) is a multispectral disorder requiring lifelong management. Its pathophysiology is still being explored which makes its treatment options restrained. Present study explores impact of oral contraceptive mode of treatment on , hormonal, inflammation and coagulation profile of PCOS women. 50 subjects diagnosed with Rotterdam criteria receiving no drug treatment served as controls whereas 50 subjects receiving only OCPs (Ethinyl estradiol 0.03 mg,  0.15 mg) as a mode of treatment at least for six-months served as cases. Ferriman-Gallwey score and hormonal profile improved on OCP treatment. However, parameters like weight, Body mass index, waist-hip ratio, Oral glucose tolerance test, lipid profile, insulin, HOMA-IR, adiponectin, interleukin1β, visfatin, resistin, tissue factor, PT and APTT showed considerable derangements in OCP group. All above parameters are associated with the risk of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, coronary vascular disease, cancers, hypercoagulable state, venous thromboembolism and thrombotic events. Long-term use of OCPs needs to be considered carefully for PCOS patients who are already burdened with associated risk factors. This study was conducted in a region where women do not have much access to high-end screening and diagnostic facilities that further exacerbates their clinical outcomes. Large scale, long-term studies need to be designed to further evaluate safety use of OCPs in PCOS women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10761326>Contraception in diabetic women: comparative metabolic study of Norplant, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, low dose oral contraceptive pill and CuT380A.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the long-term intake of Norplant, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and low dose oral contraceptive pill (OCs) on glycemic control, lipoprotein metabolism and coagulation profile in diabetic women.Prospective comparative study including 80 uncomplicated controlled diabetic women.

The hormonal approach is based on suppression of gonadotropins and thus of testicular function and spermatogenesis, and has been investigated for several decades. This approach can achieve sufficient suppression of spermatogenesis for effective contraception in most men, but not all; the basis for these men responding insufficiently is unclear. Alternatively, the non-hormonal approach is based on identifying specific processes in sperm development, maturation and function. A range of targets has been identified in animal models, and targeted effectively. This approach, however, remains in the pre-clinical domain at present. There are, therefore, grounds for considering that safe, effective and reversible methods of contraception for men can be developed.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A wide variety of contraceptives are available for these women. However, hormonal contraceptives might influence carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and increase micro- and macrovascular complications, so caution in selecting a contraceptive method is required.To investigate whether progestogen-only, combined estrogen and progestogen or non-hormonal contraceptives differ in terms of effectiveness in preventing pregnancy, in their side effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and in long-term complications such as micro- and macrovascular disease when used in women with .The search was performed in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, POPLINE, CINAHL, WorldCat, ECO, ArticleFirst, the Science Citation Index, the British Library Inside, and reference lists of relevant articles. The last search was performed in January 2013. In addition, experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies marketing contraceptives were contacted to identify published, unpublished or ongoing studies.Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that studied women with  comparing: 1. hormonal versus non-hormonal contraceptives; 2. progestogen-only versus estrogen and progestogen contraceptives; 3. contraceptives containing < 50 µg estrogen versus contraceptives containing ≥ 50 µg estrogen; and 4. contraceptives containing first-, second- and third-generation progestogens, drospirenone and cyproterone acetate. The principal outcomes were contraceptive effectiveness,  control, lipid metabolism and micro- and macrovascular complications.Two investigators evaluated the titles and abstracts identified from the literature search. Quality assessment was performed independently with discrepancies resolved by discussion or consulting a third review author. Because the trials differed in studied contraceptives, participant characteristics and methodological quality, we could not combine the data in a meta-analysis. The trials were therefore examined on an individual basis and narrative summaries were provided.Four randomised controlled trials were included. No unintended pregnancies were reported during the study periods. Only one trial was of good methodological quality. It compared the influence of a -releasing intrauterine device (IUD) versus a copper IUD on carbohydrate metabolism in women with type 1 . No significant difference was found between the two groups. The other three trials were of limited methodological quality. Two compared progestogen-only pills with different estrogen and progestogen combinations, and one also included the -releasing IUD and copper IUD. The trials reported that blood glucose levels remained stable during treatment with most regimens. Only high-dose combined oral contraceptives and 30 µg ethinylestradiol + 75 µg gestodene were identified as slightly impairing glucose homeostasis. The three studies found conflicting results regarding lipid metabolism. Some combined oral contraceptives appeared to have a minor adverse effect while others appeared to slightly improve lipid metabolism. The copper IUD and progestogen-only oral contraceptives also slightly improved lipid metabolism and no influence was seen while using the levonorgestel-releasing IUD. Only one study reported on micro- and macrovascular complications. It observed no signs or symptoms of thromboembolic incidents or visual disturbances, however study duration was short. Only minor adverse effects were reported in two studies.The four included randomised controlled trials in this systematic review provided insufficient evidence to assess whether progestogen-only and combined contraceptives differ from non-hormonal contraceptives in  control, lipid metabolism and complications. Three of the four studies were of limited methodological quality, sponsored by pharmaceutical companies and described surrogate outcomes. Ideally, an adequately reported, high-quality randomised controlled trial analysing both intermediate outcomes (that is glucose and lipid metabolism) and true clinical endpoints (micro- and macrovascular disease) in users of combined, progestogen-only and non-hormonal contraceptives should be conducted. However, due to the low incidence of micro- and macrovascular disease and accordingly the large sample size and long follow-up period needed to observe differences in risk, a randomised controlled trial might not be the ideal design.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12502684>Effects of injectable or implantable progestin-only contraceptives on insulin-glucose metabolism and  risk.</a></h2><p>Progestin-only contraceptives administered by injection (Depo-Provera) or subcutaneous implant (Norplant) have been available to U.S. women for about a decade. Two epidemiological studies found their use associated with increased incidence of type 2 . In reviewing publications relating progestin injections and implants to glucose metabolism, 25 studies of various study designs and laboratory methods were identified that reported at least one insulin value in nondiabetic women. Research subjects were usually nonobese and often from developing countries. Of eight studies that performed sequential oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) after at least 6 months of Depo-Provera or Norplant use, seven found significant elevations (approximate doubling) of insulin at 2 or 3 h after glucose challenge; the effects on fasting, half-hour, or 1-h postchallenge insulin values were less consistent. The three studies that performed sequential intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTTs) on injection users all found an increased early-phase insulin response. One study used sequential hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps to demonstrate reduced total-body glucose uptake per unit of insulin after 8 weeks of Norplant use. The metabolic studies generally did not show a reduction in the glucose tolerance of their nondiabetic subjects. However, compared with the lean and low-risk women who were usually selected for metabolic research, many U.S. women receiving these injections or implants may start out with increased insulin resistance due to greater weight, sedentary lifestyle, and family or childbearing histories. Additional research could help clarify whether exposure to injectable or implantable contraceptives leads to increased risk of type 2  and gestational  in women with predisposing factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3933351>Triphasic oral contraception: metabolic effects in normal women and those with previous gestational .</a></h2><p>The effect of a low-dose triphasic oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol and ) on glucose tolerance, plasma insulin and glucagon responses to glucose, fasting plasma cortisol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and very--low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was investigated in 16 women with previous gestational  and in 19 normal women. Investigations were performed prior to the hormonal intake and after treatment for 2 and 6 months. Before treatment, the women with previous gestational  had significantly elevated fasting glucose (p less than 0.05) and impaired glucose tolerance (p less than 0.05) when compared to those of the healthy control subjects. The glucose, insulin, and glucagon responses to oral glucose remained unchanged during the treatment period. Plasma cortisol increased in both groups (p less than 0.05) whereas plasma triglycerides increased in the control subjects only (p less than 0.05). Plasma free fatty acids, lipoproteins, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio remained unchanged in both groups.

As women age, their fecundity decreases but does not disappear until menopause. After age 40, 75% of pregnancies are unplanned and may result in profound physical and emotional impact. Clinical evaluation must be relied on to diagnose menopause, since hormonal levels fluctuate widely. Until menopause is confirmed, some potential for pregnancy remains; at age 45, women's sterility rate is 55%. Older gravidas experience higher rates of , hypertension, and death. Many safe and effective contraceptive options are available to perimenopausal women. In addition to preventing an unplanned and higher-risk pregnancy, perimenopausal contraception may improve abnormal uterine bleeding, hot flashes, and menstrual migraines. Long-acting reversible contraceptives, including the  intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), the etonogestrel subdermal implant (ESI), and the copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD), provide high efficacy without estrogen. LNG-IUS markedly decreases menorrhagia commonly seen in perimenopause. Both ESI and LNG-IUS provide endometrial protection for women using estrogen for vasomotor symptoms. Women without cardiovascular risk factors can safely use combined hormonal contraception. The CDC's Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use informs choices for women with comorbidities. No medical contraindications exist for  emergency-contraceptive pills, though obesity does decrease efficacy. In contrast, the Cu-IUD provides reliable emergency and ongoing contraception regardless of body mass index (BMI).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8222475>Contraception in the diabetic woman.</a></h2><p>Contraceptive prescription in women with current , type I or II, and in women with previous gestational  must be highly effective and take into account the metabolic effects and risks particular to .

An oral glucose tolerance test was performed before treatment and after tablet intake for 2 and 6 months. At each test, plasma values of glucose, insulin, and glucagon were measured. Before treatment the non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients demonstrated significantly increased glucose values and decreased insulin values as compared with the values of the control subjects. During treatment they displayed a small but significant rise in plasma insulin values. The glucose tolerance, however, remained unaffected in both groups during the study period. No change in body weight or blood pressure was observed.

Currently, all approved members of the class require administration by injection. Areas covered: This manuscript reviews oral semaglutide-an experimental GLP-1 receptor agonist in phase-3 clinical development. Available pharmacological and clinical data of the drug are reviewed, and important end-points described. Expert opinion: Oral peptide delivery has become possible with the discovery of absorption enhancers. The clinical development program of once-daily oral semaglutide has shown superiority in reducing glycosylated hemoglobin and body weight in comparison with placebo and active comparators (sitagliptin, liraglutide, and empagliflozin). Safety and tolerability of oral semaglutide is in line with injectable members of the class. Delayed gastric emptying, local increase in pH, and enhanced absorption do not seem to affect the exposure of a number of other oral drugs that have been tested (metformin, digoxin, oral contraceptive ethinylestradiol/, lisinopril, warfarin, furosemide and rosuvastatin). Clinical questions for further investigation include the effectiveness and safety of oral semaglutide in cardiovascular indications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22230306>Evaluation and management of abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women.</a></h2><p>Up to 14 percent of women experience irregular or excessively heavy menstrual bleeding. This abnormal uterine bleeding generally can be divided into anovulatory and ovulatory patterns. Chronic anovulation can lead to irregular bleeding, prolonged unopposed estrogen stimulation of the endometrium, and increased risk of endometrial cancer. Causes include polycystic ovary syndrome, uncontrolled , thyroid dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia, and use of antipsychotics or antiepileptics. Women 35 years or older with recurrent anovulation, women younger than 35 years with risk factors for endometrial cancer, and women with excessive bleeding unresponsive to medical therapy should undergo endometrial biopsy. Treatment with combination oral contraceptives or progestins may regulate menstrual cycles. Histologic findings of hyperplasia without atypia may be treated with cyclic or continuous progestin. Women who have hyperplasia with atypia or adenocarcinoma should be referred to a gynecologist or gynecologic oncologist, respectively. Ovulatory abnormal uterine bleeding, or menorrhagia, may be caused by thyroid dysfunction, coagulation defects (most commonly von Willebrand disease), endometrial polyps, and submucosal fibroids. Transvaginal ultrasonography or saline infusion sonohysterography may be used to evaluate menorrhagia. The -releasing intrauterine system is an effective treatment for menorrhagia. Oral progesterone for 21 days per month and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are also effective. Tranexamic acid is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ovulatory bleeding, but is expensive. When clear structural causes are identified or medical management is ineffective, polypectomy, fibroidectomy, uterine artery embolization, and endometrial ablation may be considered. Hysterectomy is the most definitive treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28144464>Effects of Second and Third Generation Oral Contraceptives on Lipid and Carbohydrate Metabolism in Overweight and Obese Women: A Randomized Triple-Blind Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) have not been shown to have major effects on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in normal-weight women. However, we have limited information about the effects on women at high risk for cardiovascular disease and  due to being overweight and obese.To evaluate the effects of second and third generation contraceptive pills on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in overweight and obese women.This triple-blind controlled trial was performed on 137 healthy women aged 18 - 40 years with a body mass index of 25-34.9 (kg/m) who were referred to health centers in Tabriz, Iran from 2014 to 2015. The women were randomly divided into groups who were to take 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol/150 mcg  (EE/LGN) (n = 69) or 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol/150 mcg desogestrel (EE/DSG) (n = 68) with an allocation ratio of 1: 1 for three cycles. As primary outcomes, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were assessed; total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and 2-hour plasma glucose in the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (2-hour 75-g OGTT) were assessed as secondary outcomes.The differences in lipid and carbohydrate parameters were not significant between the two groups, except for HDL-C (Adjusted MD (CI95%) = 7.00 (2.98 to 11.02)). HDL-C decreased with EE/LGN (P = 0.016) and increased with EE/DSG (P = 0.004). LDL-C and TC increased in both groups, whereas TG increased only with EE/DSG (P < 0.05). Compared with the baseline, FPG levels did not differ significantly in both groups, but EE/DSG increased 2-hour 75-g OGTT (P = 0.010).We observed no significant differences between the two groups in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, except for HDL-C. Considering the importance of overweight and obese women's health, studies with longer follow-up periods are recommended in this respect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16723306>Contraception in perimenopausal women with .</a></h2><p>To assess the effect of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and intrauterine devices (IUDs) on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and hemostasis in perimenopausal diabetic women.The open randomized study included a total of 113 diabetic women using COCs with different estrogen/progestogen profiles - ethinylestradiol (EE) 20 microg/desogestrel 150 microg, EE 30 microg/desogestrel 150 microg and EE 30 microg/gestodene 75 microg - and -releasing or copper IUDs. Average daily insulin requirements, levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the state of coagulation hemostatis and fibrinolytic activity were determined at baseline and after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of contraception. The control group was composed of 40 age-matched diabetic women who did not use any methods of contraception.Neither COCs nor IUDs influenced glycosylated hemoglobin and had little or no influence on the elevation in the requirements for insulin preparations. The majority of the preparations did not exert any unfavorable effect on the blood lipid profile. Taking COCs was accompanied by increased intravascular activation of blood platelets and to a lesser degree by alterations in parameters of hemostatic homeostasis. The use of IUDs had a neutral effect on blood coagulation and fibrinolysis systems.Comparing lipid levels and hemostatic variables as a function of glycosylated hemoglobin level, we conclude that  control has greater influence on these parameters than the type and dose of steroids involved in the contraceptive devices.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8574253>European Society of Contraception oral contraceptives survey update: birth control methods in "Europe of the 12".</a></h2><p>The European Society of Contraception developed a survey to examine birth control methods in the 12 countries++ of the European Community. Responses to those questions relating to prescribing++ practices of oral contraceptives (OCs) are presented herein. The survey was sent to 400 physicians. One hundred two responded, most from France, Belgium, and the United Kingdom. The responses revealed that the most popular OCs are modern combined formulations containing low doses of ethinyl estradiol and progestogens such as norgestimate, desogestrel, gestodene, and . More than half of physicians prescribe a particular formulation because of its tolerability and 20% because of its hormonal content. More than 90% prescribe OCs to healthy, nonsmoking women over 40. However, three fourths will not prescribe OCs to smokers over 35. Half of physicians recommend mammography for their older OC patients. Half also recommend cholesterol screening, but 8% only for women over 30. Most physicians are no longer reluctant to prescribe OCs to their diabetic patients: 61% prescribe OCs for women with non-insulin-dependent , 56% for those with insulin-dependent , and 85% for those with a history of gestational . Despite recent studies showing no relation between past OC use and cardiovascular disease, 42% of physicians said that their greatest OC-related health concern is cardiovascular disease. One third cited noncompliance as their greatest concern. These results reveal inhomogeneous prescribing practices for OCs among European physicians. ¿Over-screening¿--not prescribing the pill because of perceived (but not necessarily real) health risks--may be depriving many women of the contraceptive and noncontraceptive benefits of OCs. Complete and accurate information--as promoted by the European Society of Contraception--is one way to combat such overscreening.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3159545>Oral contraceptives, lipids and cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>Evidence for the involvement of changes in lipid metabolism and oral contraceptive use in the development of cardiovascular disease is briefly reviewed with particular reference to the main object of the article, to assess the effect of different oral contraceptive formulations on serum lipid levels. The preferred formulations should contain a low dose of ethynyloestradiol and should not increase serum levels of cholesterol and LDL-C or reduce those of HDL-C. Such formulations appear to be the triphasic one containing ethynyloestradiol and  and the ethynyloestradiol-desogestrel combination, which appears to be unique in that it may actually increase HDL-C. However other determinants in addition to effects on lipid metabolism will be important in deciding the choice of an oral contraceptive. Any changes which do occur in serum lipid concentrations with OC use appear within the first three months and do not appear to be progressive with continued use after this time.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25227335>Hormonal contraception, thrombosis and age.</a></h2><p>This paper reviews the risk of thrombosis with use of different types of hormonal contraception in women of different ages.Combined hormonal contraceptives with desogestrel, gestodene, drospirenone or cyproterone acetate (high-risk products) confer a sixfold increased risk of venous thromboembolism as compared with nonusers, and about twice the risk as compared with users of products with norethisterone,  or norgestimate (low-risk products). Transdermal patches and vaginal ring belong to high-risk products. The risk of thrombotic stroke and myocardial infarction is increased 50 - 100% with use of combined products, with little difference in risk between different progestins. Progestin-only products do not confer any increased risk of venous or arterial thrombosis, except for progestin depot, which may double the risk of venous thrombosis.First choice in women below 35 years should be a combined low-risk pill, that is, with a second-generation progestin, with the lowest compliable dose of estrogen. Young women with risk factors of thrombosis such as age above 35 years, genetic predispositions, adiposity, polycystic ovary syndrome, , smoking, hypertension or migraine with aura should not use high-risk products, but should primarily consider progestin-only products, and be careful to use low-risk combined products.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3781003>Oral contraceptives in diabetic women: metabolic effects of four compounds with different estrogen/progestogen profiles.</a></h2><p>The metabolic effects of four oral contraceptives with different estrogen/progestogen profiles (monophasic nonalkylated estrogen/norethindrone, low-dose monophasic ethinyl estradiol (EE2)/norethindrone, progestogen only treatment with norethindrone, and triphasic EE2/) were examined in insulin-dependent diabetic women. During the 6-month study period, no differences were found in fasting plasma glucose, 24-hour insulin requirements, glycated hemoglobin, free fatty acids, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio between the patients in each treatment group. Compared with the nonalkylated estrogen/norethindrone and the triphasic EE2/ formulations, the low-dose EE2/norethindrone combination resulted in small but significant increases in plasma triglyceride and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P less than 0.01), which seemed unfavorable from a clinical point of view.

Implanon is a single-rod implant system containing a low androgenic progestin and requires 1 to 2 minutes for insertion and removal. Like other implants, Implanon prevents pregnancy by changing the character of the cervical mucus and interfering with luteal function. Unlike Norplant, though, Implanon is designed to prevent ovulation for the full duration of use. Implant contraception has several advantages over other types of contraception including high efficacy, minimal required maintenance, absence of estrogen, and rapid return of fertility after discontinuation. Implants can be a good choice for adolescents; women with hypertension, , anemia, endometriosis, or other medical problems; and women who are breast-feeding. Irregular bleeding is the most common adverse effect of implants and can be treated with several medication regimens. Preinsertion counseling, however, is the most important factor in ensuring satisfaction with implants. Unfortunately, no implant system is currently available in the United States since August 2000, but Implanon is expected to reach the U.S. market within the next 2 years.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1778182>Update on the metabolic effects of steroidal contraceptives.</a></h2><p>Modern oral contraceptive pills are safe and show minimal metabolic effects that have little clinical significance to smoking and reproductive age (even up to menopause).

Women in the UK usually access EC from a pharmacy but then need a subsequent appointment with a general practitioner or a sexual and reproductive health (SRH) service to access regular contraception. Unintended pregnancies can occur during this time.Bridge-It is a pragmatic cluster randomised cohort cross-over trial designed to determine whether pharmacist provision of a bridging supply of a progestogen-only pill (POP) plus rapid access to a local SRH clinic, results in increased uptake of effective contraception and prevents more unintended pregnancies than provision of EC alone. Bridge-It involves 31 pharmacies in three UK regions (London, Lothian and Tayside) aiming to recruit 626-737 women. Pharmacies will give EC () according to normal practice and recruit women to both intervention and the control phases of the study. In the intervention phase, pharmacists will provide the POP (desogestrel) and offer rapid access to an SRH clinic. In the control phase, pharmacists will advise women to attend a contraceptive provider for contraception (standard care).Women will be asked 4 months later about contraceptive use. Data linkage to abortion registries will provide abortion rates over 12 months. The sample size is calculated on the primary outcome of effective contraception use at 4 months (yes/no) with 90% power and a 5% level of significance. Abortion rates will be an exploratory secondary analysis. Process evaluation includes interviews with pharmacists, SRH clinicians and women. Cost-effectiveness analysis will use a healthcare system perspective and be expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.Ethical approval was received from South East Scotland REC June 2017.

After three full years of exposure and 2,998 woman-months of use, no pregnancies had occurred. The continuation rates were 87% at 12 months, 79% at 24 months and 66% at 36 months. The most important side effect was excessive or irregular bleeding during the first year. No treatment was offered for this side effect other than vitamins and iron or change of method, with the exception of 3 cases where ethinyl estradiol was used one time for 2 weeks each. Bleeding disturbances led 8 patients to ask for removal of implants. Other side effects were headache, acne and lower abdominal pain. Blood and urine analysis tested 17 different parameters and all but plasma cortisol remained within normal limits throughout the study. A general tendency toward lowered cortisol values was observed and two subjects had more than one value below the normal limit for the population during the study. Glucose tolerance tests during the second year were abnormal in two women with familial  but they returned to normal values spontaneously at the next test.

Accurate diagnosis is of key importance to realising effective treatment, reducing morbidity and, in the case of PMB, reducing mortality. There are many tests available, including transvaginal scan (TVS), endometrial biopsy (EBx), saline infusion sonography and outpatient hysteroscopy (OPH); however, optimal diagnostic work-up is unclear.To determine the most cost-effective diagnostic testing strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of (i) HMB and (ii) PMB.Parameter inputs were derived from systematic quantitative reviews, individual patient data (IPD) from existing data sets and focused searches for specific data. In the absence of data estimates, the consensus view of an expert clinical panel was obtained.Two clinically informed decision-analytic models were constructed to reflect current service provision for the diagnostic work-up of women presenting with HMB and PMB. The model-based economic evaluation took the form of a cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the NHS in a contemporary, 'one-stop' secondary care clinical setting, where all indicated testing modalities would be available during a single visit.Two potentially cost-effective testing strategies for the initial investigation of women with HMB were identified: OPH alone or in combination with EBx. Although a combination testing strategy of OPH + EBx was marginally more effective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was approximately £21,000 to gain one more satisfied patient, whereas for OPH it was just £360 when compared with treatment with the  intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) without investigation. Initial testing with OPH was the most cost-effective testing approach for women wishing to preserve fertility and for women with symptoms refractory to empirical treatment with a LNG-IUS. For the investigation of PMB, selective use of TVS based on historical risk prediction for the diagnostic work-up of women presenting with PMB generated an ICER compared with our reference strategy of 'no initial work-up' of £129,000 per extra woman surviving 5 years. The ICERs for the two other non-dominated testing strategies, combining history and TVS or combining OPH and TVS, were over £2M each.In the absence of IPD, estimates of accuracy for test combinations presented some uncertainty where test results were modelled as being discordant.For initial investigation of women presenting to secondary care with HMB who do not require preservation of their fertility, our research suggests a choice between OPH alone or a combination of OPH and EBx. From our investigation, OPH appears to be the optimal first-line diagnostic test used for the investigation of women presenting to secondary care with HMB wishing to preserve their fertility or refractory to previous medical treatment with the LNG-IUS. We would suggest that the current recommendation of basing the initial investigation of women with PMB on the universal TVS measurement of endometrial thickness at a 5-mm threshold may need to be replaced by a strategy of restricting TVS to women with risk factors (e.g. increasing age-raised body mass index,  or nulliparity), obtained from the preceding clinical assessment.The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8828314>Use of Norplant in women with or at-risk for noninsulin-dependent .</a></h2><p>This review addresses the use of Norplant in women with or at-risk for noninsulin-dependent  (NIDDM).

Combined oral contraceptive (COC) treatment is associated with impaired glucose and lipid metabolism but the mechanisms are elusive. We therefore, hypothesized that DPP-4 inhibition ameliorates COC-induced glucose dysregulation and hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation through adenosine deaminase (ADA) /xanthine oxidase (XO) /uric acid-dependent pathway. Female Wistar rats received (po) vehicle and COC (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 μg ; po) with or without DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin; 100 mg/kg; po) for 8 weeks (n = 6/group). Glucose dysmetabolism was assessed by elevated fasting blood glucose, impaired oral glucose tolerance test and homeostatic model assessment of IR. Treatment with COC led to increased plasma fasting glucose, triglyceride-glucose index, 1-h postload glucose response, insulin, free  acid, IR and impaired glucose tolerance. COC treatment also resulted in increased plasma and hepatic TG, TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio, malondialdehyde, uric acid (plasma; 25.2 ± 0.6 mg/dl; hepatic 128.9 ± 8.0 mg/100 mg tissue), lactate dehydrogenase, DPP-4, ADA and XO (plasma;10.5 ± 1.1 U/L; hepatic 21.2 ± 1.4 U/g protein) activities. Likewise, COC led to reduction in nitric oxide level. However, DPP-4 inhibition significantly ameliorated these alterations induced by COC treatment through suppression of uric acid (plasma; 15.1 ± 1.0 mg/dl, hepatic; 75.6 ± 5.0 mg/100 mg tissue), XO (plasma; 4.1 ± 0.9 U/L, hepatic; 8.7 ± 0.4 U/g protein), ADA and DPP-4 activities suggesting their involvement in glucose dysregulation and hepatic TG accumulation induced by COC treatment. Therefore, DPP-4 inhibition would impact positively on cardiometabolic disorders, at least in part, through XO, ADA and uric acid suppression.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Because worldwide over 100 million women use oral contraceptives, issues of drug safety are of great importance. The risk of venous thrombosis during low-dose oral contraceptive use is three- to sixfold increased compared with that of nonusers. The association is not only attributed to the estrogen component of the pill: the risk is twice as high for desogestrel and gestodene (third generation) containing oral contraceptives as for  (second generation) containing oral contraceptives. The risk of venous thrombosis is highest in the first year of use and in women with genetic or acquired risk factors for thrombosis. Both venous or arterial thrombosis are unrelated to duration of use or past use of combined oral contraceptives. The risk of myocardial infarction and stroke during low-dose oral contraceptive use is two- to fivefold increased relative to that of nonusers. The risk of arterial thrombosis induced by oral contraceptive use is more pronounced in smokers and women with hypertension, , and hypercholesterolemia. All types of thrombosis have strongly age-dependent incidences, and therefore in absolute figures the risks and effects of risk factors increase with age. The lowering of the estrogen dose in combined oral contraceptives from 50 microg to 20-30 microg in the last decade did not clearly reduce the risk of venous thrombosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease. For stroke and peripheral arterial disease no difference in risk was found between second and third generation oral contraceptives. For myocardial infarction study results are conflicting, and a small benefit of third- over second-generation oral contraceptives cannot be ruled out. However, this is unlikely to counterbalance the adverse effect of third generation contraceptives on venous thrombosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1748246>Preconception counseling and contraception after gestational .</a></h2><p>Women with gestational  (GDM) diagnosed in the period 1978-1984 were followed for on average 6 yr after the index pregnancy. Thirty percent had  at the follow-up examination, and preliminary results indicate that at least another third will develop  during a subsequent pregnancy. Therefore, family planning and contraceptive guidance should follow the lines for women with pregestational . When low-dose hormonal contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and  were given to women with previous GDM, glucose tolerance and lipoprotein levels remained unchanged during a 6-mo treatment. However, insulin response to oral glucose increased significantly after hormonal intake for 6 mo. A triphasic preparation resulted in a significantly lower insulin response than a low-dose monophasic preparation. However, the results indicate that low-dose oral-contraceptive compounds appear to be safe for women with previous GDM when administered for limited periods. At the follow-up examination, we found no increased risk of developing  in women with previous GDM who used oral contraception. We consider the intrauterine contraceptives (IUD) a safe and effective alternative for women with previous GDM. Of 154 women with GDM, 33% chose IUD, 22% a combination-type oral contraceptive, and 16% barrier methods as their first choice of contraception 2 mo postpartum.

Long acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods are among the most efficient and cost-effective methods.We searched the Popline, PubMed, and clinicaltrials.gov databases from 1961 to March 2013 for studies on the efficacy of the IUD in diabetic women and the possible changes it may produce in laboratory parameters. Studies of at least 30 subjects with DM1 or DM2 who were studied for 6 to 12 months depending on the method of analysis were eligible.The search produced seven articles which gave event rate efficacy evaluable results and three which evaluated the effect of the IUD on laboratory parameters. One of the earlier efficacy studies showed an abnormally high pregnancy rate which sparked a controversy which is discussed in the Introduction section. The remaining 6 studies produced acceptable pregnancy rates.

The effect of taspoglutide on the pharmacokinetics of five oral drugs commonly used in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was assessed in healthy subjects.Five clinical pharmacology studies evaluated the potential drug-drug interaction between multiple subcutaneous taspoglutide doses and a single dose of lisinopril, warfarin, and simvastatin and multiple doses of digoxin and an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol and . The extent of interaction was quantified using geometric mean ratios and 90% confidence intervals for the maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve. In addition to pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic effects were assessed for warfarin and the oral contraceptive.Among the tested drugs, the effect of taspoglutide on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin was most pronounced, on the day of taspoglutide administration, the average exposure to simvastatin was decreased by - 26% and - 58% for the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and maximum plasma concentration, respectively, accompanied by an increase in average exposure to its active metabolite, simvastatin β-hydroxy acid (+ 74% and + 23% for area under the plasma concentration-time curve and maximum plasma concentration, respectively). Although statistically significant changes in exposure were observed for other test drugs, the 90% confidence intervals for the geometric mean ratio for maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve were within the 0.7-1.3 interval. No clinically relevant changes on coagulation (for warfarin) and ovulation-suppressing activity (for the oral contraceptive) were apparent.Overall, multiple doses of taspoglutide did not result in changes in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol and , lisinopril, warfarin, and simvastatin that would be considered of clinical relevance.

The best-known IUDs contain copper, but there is also an IUD delivering , a progestin; (2) How effective are these devices, and what are their adverse effects? To answer these questions, we analysed the literature using the standard Prescrire methodology; (3) T-shaped copper IUDs, with a copper surface area of 380 mm2 on 3 arms, and the -releasing device, have similar contraceptive efficacy as combined oral contraceptives that are used correctly. In contrast, IUDs are more effective than oral contraception used incorrectly; (4) Among IUD users, there are on average about 6 pregnancies per 1000 woman-years. There is less experience with the  IUD which seems to be at least as effective as copper IUDs; (5) The rare intrauterine pregnancies that occur in women using an IUD generally end in miscarriage. About 25% of these pregnancies end in a live birth if the device is left in place, compared to about 90% if the device is removed; (6) Ectopic pregnancies are rarer in IUD users than in women who do not use contraception. However, about one in 20 pregnancies that occur in women using an IUD is ectopic; (7) The IUD is expelled in about 5% to 10% of cases within 5 years, and expulsion recurs in about 30% of these women; (8) Problems such as difficult insertion, pain, bleeding and syncope are reported in less than 1.5% of cases overall; (9) Uterine perforation during insertion is rare, occurring in 0.6 to 16 cases per 1000 insertions, regardless of the type of IUD. The risk of perforation is higher when the IUD is inserted less than 4 to 6 weeks after delivery or elective abortion; (10) During the first 3 months after insertion, the risk of pelvic infection is slightly higher than in the general population, especially in women with pre-existing asymptomatic Chlamydia trachomatis infection. There are about 6 pelvic infections per 1000 woman-years of IUD use. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is unnecessary. The interview and physical examination may lead to diagnosis of C. trachomatis infection or other sexually transmitted infections. In these cases, treatment may be needed before IUD insertion. Women must be warned that IUDs do not protect them from sexually transmitted diseases; (11) Menstrual bleeding is often heavier in women with cooper IUDs than in women who do not use IUDs, and may be associated with menstrual pain; (12) The  IUD is associated with a marked reduction in menstrual blood loss and irregular bleeding; amenorrhoea occurs in 35% of women after 2 years of use. The  IUD also has hormonal adverse effects such as headache, acne, breast tension and functional ovarian cysts; (13) IUDs can safely be used in breastfeeding women, immediately after a pregnancy, in cases of diabetes or HIV infection, during nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug therapy, and after an ectopic pregnancy. The only problems occurring in women who have never had children are pain during insertion and more frequent expulsions; (14) A copper IUD is a first-line contraceptive method for women with a history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or coronary events; (15) It is better to postpone IUD insertion when the woman has a genital tract infection or unexplained vaginal bleeding; (16) IUD insertion is an effective alternative to "morning-after" hormonal contraception.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21413894>Menstrual concerns and intrauterine contraception among adolescent bariatric surgery patients.</a></h2><p>Adolescent  has dramatically increased in recent decades, and along with that so have other medical comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and pseudotumor cerebri.  and related comorbidites may be contraindications to hormonal contraception, making contraception counseling of morbidly obese adolescents more challenging.

We tested whether an intervention targeting the reduction of hepato-visceral adiposity is followed by a higher ovulation rate than OC treatment.This randomized, open-label, single-center, pilot proof-of-concept study (12 months on treatment, then 12 months off) was performed in adolescent girls with hirsutism and oligomenorrhea (PCOS by National Institutes of Health; no sexual activity; N = 36; mean age 16 years, body mass index 23.5 kg/m; 94% study completion). Compared treatments were OC (ethinylestradiol-) versus low-dose combination of spironolactone 50 mg/d, pioglitazone 7.5 mg/d, and metformin 850 mg/d (SPIOMET). Primary outcome was post-treatment ovulation rate inferred from menstrual diaries and salivary progesterone (12 + 12 weeks). Secondary outcomes included body composition (dual X-ray absorptiometry), abdominal fat (magnetic resonance imaging), insulinemia (oral glucose tolerance test), and androgenemia (liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry).SPIOMET was followed by a 2.5-fold higher ovulation rate than OC (p ≤ .001) and by a 6-fold higher normovulatory fraction (71% vs. 12%; p ≤ .001); oligoanovulation risk after SPIOMET was 65% lower (95% confidence interval, 40%-89%) than after OC. Higher post-treatment ovulation rates related to more on-treatment loss of hepatic fat (r = .27; p < .005). Visceral fat and insulinemia normalized only with SPIOMET; androgenemia normalized faster with OC but rebounded more thereafter. Body weight, lean mass, and abdominal subcutaneous fat mass remained stable in both groups.Early SPIOMET treatment for PCOS normalized post-treatment ovulation rates more than OC. Focusing PCOS treatment on early reduction of hepato-visceral fat may prevent part of later oligoanovulatory subfertility.Copyright © 2017 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Changes in carbohydrate metabolism occurred as early as 1 month but were most marked after 6 months. After 1 month the area under the glucose and insulin curves increased by 12.3% and 37.7%, respectively. This increase was more marked by 6 months, but by 12 months it was significantly less marked. Although changes in the blood glucose and plasma insulin levels at different times during the oral glucose tolerance test occurred, they were all within normal limits for normal women. The peak blood glucose and insulin levels after insertion of the implant occurred 60 minutes after the glucose load, as opposed to 30 minutes before insertion.

Glucose tolerance test was performed before treatment was started and then after 1,3 and 6 months in microgynon users. The mean areas under the glucose curves were also significantly elevated. Significant increase in blood glucose values were noted only at 30 minutes after 6 months of use of the progestogen-only oral contraceptive but the mean blood glucose values were higher than in the control after 1,3 and 6 months of use.

This study evaluated the drug interaction potential of exenatide when administered adjunctively with oral contraceptives, given their potential concomitant use.This trial evaluated the effect of exenatide co-administration on single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of a combination oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol [EE] 30 μg,  [LV] 150 μg [Microgynon 30®]). Thirty-two healthy female subjects participated in an open-label, randomised, crossover trial with 3 treatment periods (oral contraceptive alone, 1 hour before exenatide, 30 minutes after exenatide). Subjects received a single dose of oral contraceptive on Day 8 of each period and QD doses on Days 10 through 28. During treatment periods of concomitant usage, exenatide was administered subcutaneously prior to morning and evening meals at 5 μg BID from Days 1 through 4 and at 10 μg BID from Days 5 through 22. Single- (Day 8) and multiple-dose (Day 22) pharmacokinetic profiles were assessed for each treatment period.Exenatide did not alter the bioavailability nor decrease daily trough concentrations for either oral contraceptive component. No substantive changes in oral contraceptive pharmacokinetics occurred when oral contraceptive was administered 1 hour before exenatide. Single-dose oral contraceptive administration 30 minutes after exenatide resulted in mean (90% CI) Cmax reductions of 46% (42-51%) and 41% (35-47%) for EE and LV, respectively. Repeated daily oral contraceptive administration 30 minutes after exenatide resulted in Cmax reductions of 45% (40-50%) and 27% (21-33%) for EE and LV, respectively. Peak oral contraceptive concentrations were delayed approximately 3 to 4 hours. Mild-to-moderate nausea and vomiting were the most common adverse events observed during the trial.The observed reduction in Cmax is likely of limited importance given the unaltered oral contraceptive bioavailability and trough concentrations; however, for oral medications that are dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy, such as contraceptives and antibiotics, patients should be advised to take those drugs at least 1 hour before exenatide injection.ClinicalTrials.gov: .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1511755>Effect of oral contraceptive use on the incidence of impaired glucose tolerance and .</a></h2><p>Combined estrogen-progestin high-dose oral contraceptives increase the risk of impaired glucose tolerance which is estimated at approximately 12% of oral contraceptive current users. Glucose tolerance is adversely affected by the chemical structure of the progestins contained in oral contraceptives such as estrane (norethindrone, ethynodiol) and particularly gonane (norgestrel).

Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), is the usual first choice of treatment in women with PCOS. Because OCP use has been linked to the risk of venous thrombosis and there are limited data on the effect of OCP use on the inflammatory state of women with PCOS, our objective was to compare the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 between drug-naive and OCP-treated women with PCOS. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Consequent to women diagnosed with PCOS on the basis of Rotterdam 2003 criteria, either treated with OCPs (ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg, levonogestrel-0.15 mg) for a period of 6 months (n = 50) or drug-naive (n = 51) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study.The mean ages of patients and control participants were comparable (21.99 ± 4.78 vs 21.92 ± 5.83 years; P = .947) as was body mass index (24.47 ± 3.92 vs 23.66 ± 3.43; P = .271). Clinical and androgen excess symptoms were significantly better in the OCP group compared with the drug-naive group (P = .01, P = .04). Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly higher in the OCP group (P = .01). Plasma ICAM-1 levels, TNF-α levels, and MCP-1 levels showed a higher trend in patients but reached statistical significance only in cases of ICAM-1 and TNF-α (P = .01).OCP treatment of 6 months increases plasma ICAM-1, MCP-1, and TNF-α levels among women with PCOS, although OCPs significantly help in ameliorating features of hyperandrogenism and regularizing menstrual cycles. These cytokines correlate positively with many  parameters including plasma glucose, lipids, and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance. Further investigation with well designed, randomized, longitudinal studies might help to ascertain the effect of OCPs on proinflammatory profiles among women with PCOS.Copyright © 2016 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.

Exogenous sex steroids produce important effects on lipid metabolism. Early intervention against cholesterol is important in reducing cardiovascular risk. Current users of high-dose formulations, particularly older women who smoke, are at greatest risk for cardiovascular complications, especially myocardial infarction. Low-dose oral contraceptives have more modest effects on lipid metabolism, but important differences in the potency of progestins remain. Fortunately, recent studies among users of lower-dose oral contraceptive formulations fail to show an increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Nonetheless, prudent physicians will avoid oral contraceptives that may adversely affect lipoprotein metabolism, such as those containing progestins with high androgenic and antiestrogenic potency.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3111056>[Hormonal contraception with ethinylestradiol and gestoden.

A third (n = 28) of the patients were pre-menarcheal at first review with parent/caregivers seeking anticipatory advice. Of the post-menarcheal patients, the median age of menarche was 12 years (range 10-15 years). First and second line interventions were documented as were reasons for change where applicable. The combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) was the most frequently used therapy (67%), and 19 patients in total had a  releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) inserted (31%). Our study population differs from similar previously published groups in the marked absence of the use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate or the subdermal etonogestrel releasing device.As a paediatrician, it is important to address menstrual management issues and allay caregiver concerns with appropriate advice. Our study supports the use of the COCP as sound first line management in achieving menstrual suppression. The LNG-IUS appears to be a favourable second line option. Further investigation into longer-term outcomes and potential complications of device insertion is recommended.© 2017 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15802410>Effect of a  intrauterine system on women with type 1 : a randomized trial.</a></h2><p>Women with  need safe, effective contraception. Although intrauterine devices provide superior contraception, concerns remain that progestin absorbed systemically from the -releasing device may impair carbohydrate metabolism. To examine the effect of the -releasing intrauterine system on glucose metabolism in diabetic women.We randomly assigned 62 women with uncomplicated insulin-dependent  to either a -releasing or a copper T 380A intrauterine device. The primary outcome to assess glucose metabolism was glycosylated hemoglobin; fasting serum-glucose levels and daily insulin dose requirements over 12 months of observation were examined as well.Outcome data were available for 29 women using the -releasing and 30 using the copper device. At 12 months, mean glycosylated levels were similar for women of the 2 groups (6.3%, standard deviation [SD] +/- 1.5 compared with 6.3%, SD +/- 1.3, respectively). The same was true for mean fasting-serum glucose levels (7.4 mM, SD +/- 4.2 compared with 7.5 mM, SD +/- 4.2) and daily insulin doses (35.1 units, SD +/- 12.8 compared with 36.4 units, SD +/- 9.0). No important differences were noted at either 6 weeks or 6 months.The -releasing device had no adverse effect on glucose metabolism, even at the 6-week observation when systemic levels of  would have been higher than at later observations. Concern about a potential adverse effect of this contraceptive on glucose control is unwarranted, and its use in women with  should be liberalized.I.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20695771>Hormonal contraception in women with the metabolic syndrome: a narrative review.</a></h2><p>The metabolic syndrome (MS) is a set of five cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors: elevated waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides and blood pressure; and reduced HDL-cholesterol. The prevalence of the MS is rising worldwide, and is linked to two diagnoses in young women: polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and gestational  (GDM).This narrative review focuses on hormonal contraceptive choices available for women in Europe with features of the MS.The -intrauterine system and progestogen-only pills containing desogestrel or  have no significant effects on MS parameters. Combined oestrogen-progestogen methods do not appear to increase waist circumference or the incidence of glucose intolerance in women with PCOS or a history of GDM; their effect on HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides is comparable with that observed in women without the MS, while the effect on blood pressure remains inconclusive. The etonogestrel implant does not affect body weight, triglycerides and blood pressure but mildly reduces insulin sensitivity and HDL-cholesterol in healthy women. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate increases body weight and truncal fat deposition, and lowers glucose tolerance in women with previous GDM.Low-dose hormonal contraception is safe for many women with the MS, but high-dose progestogens must be avoided.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2256489>Effect of low-dose oral contraceptives on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in women with recent gestational : results of a controlled, randomized, prospective study.</a></h2><p>Women with recent gestational  were randomly assigned to one of two low-dose oral contraceptives to evaluate the effect of low-dose oral contraceptives on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. A cohort of similar women requesting a non-oral-contraceptive method served as controls. The two oral contraceptives studied were ethinyl estradiol (0.035 mg)-norethindrone (0.40 mg) and ethinyl estradiol (0.030 to 0.040 mg)- (0.050 to 0.125 mg). A 75 gm, 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test and a fasting lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglyceride, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterols) were performed at entry, after 3 months, and after 6 to 13 months of treatment. The prevalence of  at 6 to 13 months (27/156 patients) was not significantly different between groups (non-oral-contraceptive group, 17%; ethinyl estradiol-norethindrone, 15%; ethinyl estradiol-, 20%). When examined by prior gestational  class,  was present in 7% of prior class A1 and 29% of women with prior class A2 disease (p less than 0.001). Mean cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly improved in all three groups at 3 months and at 6 to 13 months, whereas triglycerides remained unchanged. There were no differences in cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triglycerides levels between the groups. After 6 to 13 months, there was a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the ethinyl estradiol-norethindrone group compared with the ethinyl estradiol- and non-oral-contraceptive groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21714581>Effect of multiple oral doses of linagliptin on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of a combination oral contraceptive in healthy female adults: an open-label, two-period, fixed-sequence, multiple-dose study.</a></h2><p>Linagliptin is an oral dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor that has been recently approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Microgynon® 30 is a combined oral contraceptive pill containing both ethinylestradiol 30 μg and  150 μg (EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg).The objective of this study was to determine the effect of multiple doses of linagliptin (5 mg once daily) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of EE and LNG following once-daily doses of EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg.This was an open-label, two-period, fixed-sequence, multiple-dose study, consisting of a run-in period, a 14-day reference treatment period and a 7-day test treatment period. The study recruited 18 healthy pre-menopausal female subjects aged 18-40 years with a body mass index of 18.5-27.0 kg/m2. Only women with regular menstrual cycles were included in this study. The treatment sequence was divided into three steps: an individually tailored run-in period with EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg to synchronize the menstrual cycles of the subjects followed by a washout period of 7 days; the reference treatment period, during which EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg alone was taken on days 1-14; and the test treatment period, during which EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg plus linagliptin were taken on days 15-21. The pharmacokinetic parameters measured were maximum steady-state plasma concentration during a dosage interval (C(max,ss)), time to reach maximum plasma concentration following administration at steady state (t(max,ss)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve during a dosage interval (τ) at steady state (AUC(τ,ss)).The AUC(τ,ss) and C(max,ss) of EE and LNG were comparable when EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg was given alone or combined with linagliptin. The adjusted geometric mean ratios for AUC(τ,ss) and C(max,ss) of EE following EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg plus linagliptin versus EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg alone were 101.4 (90% CI 97.2, 105.8) and 107.8 (90% CI 99.7, 116.6), respectively. The adjusted geometric mean ratios for AUC(τ,ss) and C(max,ss) of LNG following EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg plus linagliptin versus EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg alone were 108.8 (90% CI 104.5, 113.3) and 113.5 (90% CI 106.1, 121.3), respectively. The combination was well tolerated.Linagliptin had no clinically relevant effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of EE and LNG in healthy female subjects, and the combination of EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg and linagliptin was well tolerated in this study. Therefore, linagliptin has the potential to be used in the treatment of female patients with type 2 diabetes in combination with oral contraceptives containing these components, such as EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg.The EudraCT number for this study is 2008-000953-37.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3287933>Oral contraceptives and coronary heart disease: modulation of glucose tolerance and plasma lipid risk factors by progestins.</a></h2><p>Widespread use of oral contraceptive formulations by women throughout their reproductive life has given rise to concerns about the effects of oral contraceptives on risk factors for coronary heart disease. Oral contraceptive-induced changes in both carbohydrate and lipoprotein risk factors may contribute to an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Carbohydrate and lipoprotein risk factors for coronary heart disease are reviewed, and oral contraceptive-induced changes in carbohydrate and lipoprotein metabolism, which may lead to altered risk status for coronary heart disease, are discussed. The importance of methodology in evaluating the results of studies assessing such oral contraceptive-induced changes is stressed. The role of progestins in influencing coronary heart disease risk factors is surveyed, and differences among progestins commonly used in oral contraceptive formulations are discussed. In addition, the effect of various combination oral contraceptives on risk factor status is outlined. Finally, the implications of available evidence for the selection of progestins for oral contraceptive formulations of the future are discussed. Current data indicate that medium- and low-fixed-dose oral contraceptive formulations containing estrogen/norethindrone acetate have less metabolic impact than do comparable -containing formulations, including multiphasic formulations. Triphasic formulations may have less effect on coronary heart disease risk factors, although data are not yet conclusive. Novel progestins such as desogestrel may also have lesser effects on metabolic functions, but the reduced androgenicity of such compounds may expose women to an increased risk of estrogen-induced hypertriglyceridemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18533124>Comparison of metabolic and inflammatory outcomes in women who used oral contraceptives and the -releasing intrauterine device in a general population.</a></h2><p>We compared the metabolic and cardiovascular parameters of a reference group of women with those of women who used 2 contraceptive regimes that are used worldwide: the -releasing intrauterine device and oral contraceptives.We investigated a cohort of 2814 women at age 31 years from the general population-based Northern Finland Birth Cohort who were born in 1966. Women were classified as oral contraceptive users (n = 687 women), -releasing intrauterine device users (n = 168 women), or no use of hormonal contraception (reference group; n = 1959 women). The analyses were adjusted for body mass index, current alcohol use, household income, and area of residence.Compared with the reference group, oral contraceptive users had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, raised levels of inflammatory indices (C-reactive protein), and impaired insulin sensitivity. -releasing intrauterine device users displayed a lower high-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol, but a similar cholesterol/ high-density lipoprotein ratio, and higher leukocyte count compared with the reference group. Oral contraception users were insulin-resistant compared with -releasing intrauterine device users with higher blood pressure, raised lipid levels (such as total cholesterol and triglycerides) and insulin levels, and lower homeostasis model assessment and insulin sensitivity, despite smaller waist and lower waist-hip ratio.Oral contraception usage was associated with adverse findings in several metabolic, cardiovascular, and inflammatory parameters, which is consistent with an increased future risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. These findings should invite more criticism of recent trends that encourage the prescription of oral contraceptives for years during reproductive life and especially in premenopausal women. In contrast, -releasing intrauterine device or progestin-only pills may offer long-term health benefits over oral contraceptives and should be preferred to oral contraceptives for women in their forties and/or with metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1954724>Contraception for women with : an update.</a></h2><p>Today several effective contraceptive methods are available for women with IDDM. Contraceptive guidance as part of the pre-pregnancy counselling needs to be more widely implemented by general practitioners and in non-specialized obstetrical and gynaecological departments. Women with  are generally well motivated, and thus the barrier methods may prove both acceptable and reliable contraceptive agents for some of these women. When, however, a high risk of user failure can be predicted, the IUD or hormonal contraception may be the only reversible alternative. According to our findings, IUDs can be recommended without reservation to women with IDDM. In women with previous GDM it seems that low dose oral contraceptive compounds may be administered without running the risk of inducing glucose intolerance, but long-term results are still unavailable. Natural oestrogens may be administered in combination with a progestogen for a limited period as an efficient and acceptable mode of contraception in women with IDDM without any concomitant adverse effects on diabetic control. From our investigations it also appears that short-term administration of combined low dose OCs containing the traditional progestogens (e.g. norethisterone or ) or the new gonane progestogens (e.g. gestodene) does not alter glycaemic control in women with IDDM. Similarly, these compounds do not cause any significant changes in lipid/lipoprotein levels during short-term treatment, although the intake of monophasic ethinyloestradiol/norethisterone preparations may result in higher triglyceride levels and tends to increase lipid levels more than triphasic ethinyloestradiol/ compounds. The results from our clinic have shown that OCs can be safely recommended at pre-conception counselling so that women with  can obtain both optimal glycaemic control and efficient spacing of their pregnancies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9673836>Oral contraceptives and venous thromboembolism. A case-control study.</a></h2><p>To assess the influence of oral contraceptives (OC) on the risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in young women, a 5-year case-control study including all women 15-44 years old suffering a first deep venous thrombosis or a first pulmonary embolism from all Danish hospitals, along with 1200 control subjects during the period 1994-1995, was conducted. Of 586 patient and 1200 control subject questionnaires sent out, 523 patient (89.2%) and 1074 control (89.5%) questionnaires were returned with an agreement to participate. After exclusion of women with nonvalid diagnoses, women who were pregnant, and women with previous VTE or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 375 patients and 1041 control subjects were available for analysis. Potential tested confounders included: body mass index, length of OC use, family history of VTE, AMI, or stroke, smoking habits, coagulopathies, , years of schooling, certainty of diagnosis, previous births, and treated hypertension during any pregnancy. A multivariate analysis was performed. Estrogen dose had no influence on the risk for VTE. The risk for VTE among current users of OC was primarily influenced by duration of use, with significantly decreasing odds ratios (OR) over time: < 1 year; 5.1 (3.1-8.5); 1-5 years; 2.5 (1.6-4.1); and > 5 years; 2.1 (1.5-3.1), all compared with those for nonusers of OC. This trend was still significant after adjustment for progestin types. Without adjustment for duration of use, current users of OC with second generation ( or norgestimate) and third generation (desogestrel or gestodene) progestins had OR of 1.8 (1.1-2.9) and 3.2 (2.3-4.4), respectively. After correction for duration of use, however, no significant differences were found between users of OC with different types of progestins. In conclusion, OC increase the risk for VTE significantly. The risk among current users of OC is primarily influenced by duration of use. No difference in risk was found according to estrogen dose, and the difference in risk between different types of progestins was not statistically significant after adjustment for duration of use.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22513937>Steroidal contraceptives: effect on carbohydrate metabolism in women without .</a></h2><p>Many hormonal contraceptives have been associated with changes in carbohydrate metabolism. Alterations may include decreased glucose tolerance and increased insulin resistance, which are risk factors for Type 2  and cardiovascular disease. These issues have been raised primarily with contraceptives containing estrogen.To evaluate the effect of hormonal contraceptives on carbohydrate metabolism in healthy women and those at risk for  due to overweight.In February 2012, we searched the computerized databases MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, and LILACS for studies of hormonal contraceptives and carbohydrate metabolism. We also searched for clinical trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. Previous searches also included EMBASE.All randomized controlled trials were considered if they examined carbohydrate metabolism in women without  who used hormonal contraceptives for contraception. Comparisons could be a placebo, a non-hormonal contraceptive, or another hormonal contraceptive that differed in drug, dosage, or regimen. Interventions included at least three cycles. Outcomes included glucose and insulin measures.We assessed all titles and abstracts identified during the literature searches. The data were extracted and entered into RevMan. We wrote to researchers for missing data. For continuous variables, the mean difference (MD) was computed with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model. For dichotomous outcomes, the Peto odds ratio with 95% CI was calculated.We found 31 trials that met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-one trials compared combined oral contraceptives (COCs); others examined different COC regimens, progestin-only pills, injectables, a vaginal ring, and implants. None included a placebo. Of 34 comparisons, eight had any notable difference between the study groups in an outcome.Twelve trials studied desogestrel-containing COCs, and the few differences from  COCs were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of two studies showed the desogestrel group had a higher mean fasting glucose (MD 0.20; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.41). Where data could not be combined, single studies showed lower mean fasting glucose (MD -0.40; 95% CI -0.72 to -0.08) and higher means for two-hour glucose response (MD 1.08; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.71) and insulin area under the curve (AUC) (MD 20.30; 95% CI 4.24 to 36.36).Three trials examined the etonogestrel vaginal ring and one examined an etonogestrel implant. One trial showed the ring group had lower mean AUC insulin than the -COC group (MD -204.51; 95% CI -389.64 to -19.38).Of eight trials of norethisterone preparations, five compared COCs and three compared injectables. In a COC trial, a norethisterone group had smaller mean change in glucose two-hour response than a -COC group (MD -0.30; 95% CI -0.54 to -0.06). In an injectable study, a group using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate had higher means than the group using norethisterone enanthate for fasting glucose (MD 10.05; 95% CI 3.16 to 16.94), glucose two-hour response (MD 17.00; 95% CI 5.67 to 28.33), and fasting insulin (MD 3.40; 95% CI 2.07 to 4.73).Among five recent trials, two examined newer COCs with different estrogen types. One showed the group with nomegestrel acetate plus 17β-estradiol had lower means than the  group for incremental AUC glucose (MD -1.43; 95% CI -2.55 to -0.31) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (MD -0.10; 95% CI -0.18 to -0.02). Two trials compared extended versus conventional (cyclic) regimens. With a dienogest COC, an extended-use group had greater mean change in AUC glucose (MD 82.00; 95% CI 10.72 to 153.28). In a small trial using two  COCs, the lower-dose group showed smaller mean change in fasting glucose (MD -3.00; 95% CI -5.89 to -0.11), but the obese and normal weight women did not differ significantly.Current evidence suggests no major differences in carbohydrate metabolism between different hormonal contraceptives in women without . We cannot make strong statements due to having few studies that compared the same types of contraceptives. Many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses. Many of the earlier studies had limited reporting of methods.We still know very little about women at risk for metabolic problems due to being overweight. More than half of the trials had weight restrictions as inclusion criteria. Only one small trial stratified the groups by body mass index (obese versus normal).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1317637>Contraception after thirty-five.</a></h2><p>Our knowledge about the safety, the incidence of side effects, and the effectiveness of contraceptive methods for women in premenopause, or during the last decade of their reproductive life, has not been a primary interest for research and development in fertility control. The main purpose of trials for the evaluation of new contraceptive methods is to test their effectiveness, and therefore only women below 38 years of age are accepted. Furthermore, when new methods are being tested, only healthy women are accepted, and those having health problems of almost any kind are excluded. Therefore our knowledge about the contraceptive methods in women over 40 years of age is scanty and comes from trials with a long-lasting follow-up on healthy women who can use the method without problems until they are 45 or reach menopause. We have very limited reported information on the use of contraceptives by women who have cardiovascular disease, , liver problems, etc. Therefore the main body of experience in this review comes from healthy women between 35 and 44. On the other hand, one should remember that these women have a high motivation to use contraceptive methods and therefore the continuation rate in the trials is high. This compensates for the relatively small number of acceptors by giving more women-years in follow-up. Continuation rate and the proper use of methods are directly correlated to increase in age, socioeconomical status, and to education of users. Highly educated women in this age group have very low failure rate with almost any method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12320011>Metabolic effects of oral contraceptives: fact vs. fiction.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28290977>Actinomyces-Related Tubo-Ovarian Abscess in a Poorly Controlled Type II Diabetic With a Copper Intrauterine Device.</a></h2><p>The historic association of Actinomyces israelii infection with intrauterine devices (IUDs) has long been recognized. In recent years, the risk of developing pelvic   with a copper or  IUD has been less than 1% in women who are low risk for sexually transmitted infections. IUD-related pelvic infections secondary to actinomyces have largely vanished from contemporary practice.A 49-year-old using a copper IUD for contraception with poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus was admitted for suspected tubo-ovarian abscess on the basis of abdominopelvic pain, leukocytosis, and computed tomography findings. After she was treated with intravenous and outpatient antibiotics with clinical improvement, repeat imaging 1 month later revealed a persistent complex left adnexal mass. Tumor markers were negative but given the persistence and complex nature of the mass, surgical management was recommended. A robotic-assisted hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. Adhesiolysis, profuse irrigation, and ureteral stenting were required. Pathology revealed bilateral tubo-ovarian abscesses with actinomyces species identified on intraoperative culture. The patient had a total of 10 days of postoperative antibiotics and improved glucose control with no further signs of infection.Although actinomyces-related IUD PID is considered an outdated diagnosis, there are intermittent case reports of bizarre presentations in older women, often mimicking malignancy. Actinomyces should be a consideration in tubo-ovarian abscesses or pelvic   in patients with an IUD in place, particularly those who have poor glucose control or are otherwise immunosuppressed. Early identification and treatment of actinomyces tubo-ovarian abscesses may reduce surgical morbidity and overall improve patient outcomes and safety.Reprint & Copyright © 2017 Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20842989>Contraception choices in women with underlying medical conditions.</a></h2><p>Primary care physicians often prescribe contraceptives to women of reproductive age with comorbidities. Novel delivery systems (e.g., contraceptive patch, contraceptive ring, single-rod implantable device) may change traditional risk and benefit profiles in women with comorbidities. Effective contraceptive counseling requires an understanding of a woman's preferences and medical history, as well as the risks, benefits, adverse effects, and contraindications of each method. Noncontraceptive benefits of combined hormonal contraceptives, such as oral contraceptive pills, include regulated menses, decreased dysmenorrhea, and diminished premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Oral contraceptive pills may be used safely in women with a range of medical conditions, including well-controlled hypertension, uncomplicated diabetes mellitus, depression, and uncomplicated valvular heart disease. However, women older than 35 years who smoke should avoid oral contraceptive pills. Contraceptives containing estrogen, which can increase thrombotic risk, should be avoided in women with a history of venous thromboembolism, stroke, cardiovascular disease, or peripheral vascular disease. Progestin-only contraceptives are recommended for women with contraindications to estrogen. Depo-Provera, a long-acting injectable contraceptive, may be preferred in women with sickle cell disease because it reduces the frequency of painful crises. Because of the interaction between antiepileptics and oral contraceptive pills, Depo-Provera may also be considered in women with epilepsy. Implanon, the single-rod implantable contraceptive device, may reduce symptoms of dysmenorrhea. Mirena, the -containing intrauterine contraceptive system, is an option for women with menorrhagia, endometriosis, or chronic pelvic pain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25843520>Bariatric Surgery: Does It Play a Role in Fertility-Preserving Treatment Among Obese Young Women With Endometrial Cancer?</a></h2><p>We present the case of a 17-year-old nulliparous woman with a history of obesity (body mass index 36.2 kg/m(2)), type 2 diabetes, and polycystic ovary , who was diagnosed with grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma without radiological evidence of myometrial invasion or metastatic disease. After failure of a fertility-preserving treatment with a -releasing intrauterine device, bariatric surgery was proposed to treat the obesity and improve control of her type 2 diabetes in an attempt to increase the chances of obtaining response to local treatment. Nine months after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and 18 months after insertion of the intrauterine device, the patient reached normal body weight (body mass index 20.3 kg/m(2)) and showed complete response to treatment. As far as we know, this is the first published case of an adolescent obese patient treated with bariatric surgery concomitantly with fertility-preserving management of endometrial cancer. We propose that bariatric surgery may play a role as an adjuvant therapy in fertility-preserving treatment of endometrial cancer with local progestin, in which it could enhance remission rates and reduce recurrence.Copyright © 2015 AAGL.

Their cardiovascular risk factors were analyzed at baseline, at 5 years, and at 10 years. As 55 originally randomized to the LNG-IUS group had hysterectomy during the follow-up, all analyzes were performed by actual treatment modality.Waist circumference, body-mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and the levels of blood lipids, serum high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were measured, and the use of medication for hypertension, , hypercholesterolemia, and ischemic heart disease was analyzed.After 5 years, an increase in the use of  medication during the follow-up was only detected in the hysterectomy group (from 1.7% to 6.7%, P=0.008 vs from 5.1% to 8.4%, P=0.08), as well as they had significantly higher serum levels of TNF-α (108.59 pg/ml vs 49.02 pg/ml, P=0.001) and hsCRP (1.55 μg/ml vs 0.78 μg/ml, P=0.038) at 5- and 10-years. There was no difference between the groups in the use of cardiovascular medication, neither was there difference in blood pressure, waist circumference, BMI, or concentrations of blood lipids.Hysterectomy seems to be associated with increased levels of serum inflammatory markers and increased  medication, which in turn, may predispose individual to future cardiovascular events.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, adverse effects associated with OCs use notably the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), manifesting as ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction (MI) and venous thromboembolic diseases were reported soon after their introduction to the market in the early 1960s. Various modifications were made in an attempt to lower these risks including a reduction in the estrogen dose and changes in the progestogen compound. Currently used OCs containing the new progestin (, Desogestrel, gestodene or norgestimate) classified as low dose because all contain less than 35 microg of ethinyl estradiol. Despite their low steroid content, all have proved to be highly effective. The rationale of this reviewed study based upon cardiovascular risks in relation to these monophasic low-dose oral contraceptives. To review all relevant articles it is concluded that the risk for cardiovascular disease is lower with current preparations of oral contraceptives.

This finding led to the hypothesis that insulin might decrease serum glycodelin concentration.Euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp experiments (n = 50) were carried out on 28 women of reproductive age (range 25-47 years; mean +/- SEM 39 +/- 1.0 years), and the results were analysed with respect to their baseline serum progesterone (< 10 or > or = 10 nmol/l) and glycodelin (< 10 or > or = 10 microg/l, equivalent to < 357 or > or = 357 pmol/l) concentrations at the onset of the clamp. Ten clamp experiments were performed on five women wearing a -releasing intrauterine device (IUD), and these were analysed as a separate group.Contrary to the hypothesis, no acute glycodelin-lowering effect of insulin was found in any of the groups studied. All the small rises in glycodelin levels detected during acute hyperinsulinaemia occurred in the comparisons of medians and not means, and all such changes took place within the limits seen in the women with no progesterone exposure. In the group with low progesterone/low glycodelin (n = 21), glycodelin showed a small but significant increase at 30 and 90 min of the clamp (P < 0.01). In the group with elevated progesterone/low glycodelin (n = 11), there was a slight glycodelin increase at 30 min (P < 0.05), whereas no increase was found in the group with elevated glycodelin levels (n = 8). In the clamp experiments on women with -releasing IUD, the basal glycodelin level was low in all cases and, as in the other women with low glycodelin levels, glycodelin was slightly increased at 30, 60 and 90 min of hyperinsulinaemia (P < 0.01).The results rule out any acute glycodelin-reducing effects of insulin, although indirect long-term effects mediated by insulin on glycodelin secretion cannot be excluded.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17327307>Effects of medical therapy on insulin resistance and the cardiovascular system in polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h2><p>We aimed to determine the impact of medical therapy for symptom management on insulin resistance, metabolic profiles, and surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), an insulin-resistant pre-diabetes condition.One hundred overweight women (BMI >27 kg/m2), average age 31 years, who were nonsmokers, were not pregnant, did not have diabetes, and were off relevant medications for 3 months completed this 6-month open-label controlled trial. Randomization was to a control group (higher-dose oral contraceptive [OCP] 35 microg ethinyl estradiol [EE]/2 mg cyproterone acetate, metformin [1 g b.d.] or low-dose OCP [20 microg EE/100 microg  + aldactone 50 mg b.d.]). Primary outcome measures were insulin resistance (area under curve on oral glucose tolerance test) and surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease including arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV]) and endothelial function.All treatments similarly and significantly improved symptoms including hirsutism and menstrual cycle length. Insulin resistance was improved by metformin and worsened by the high-dose OCP. Arterial stiffness worsened in the higher-dose OCP group (PWV 7.46 vs. 8.03 m/s, P < 0.05), related primarily to the increased insulin resistance.In overweight women with PCOS, metformin and low- and high-dose OCP preparations have similar efficacy but differential effects on insulin resistance and arterial function. These findings suggest that a low-dose OCP preparation may be preferable if contraception is needed and that metformin should be considered for symptomatic management, particularly in women with additional metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25193535>Postpartum glucose tolerance in women with gestational  using  intrauterine contraception.</a></h2><p>Postpartum contraception is critical in women with gestational  (GDM).

It appears that venous risk is attributable to subtle changes in clotting factors, while arterial risk may be secondary to changes in glucose and lipid metabolism. In order to determine which women are at greatest risk from oral contraceptive use, Spellacy et al. has developed a risk scoring form that aids in the screening process. After excluding women with an absolute contraindication to pill use, women at greatest risk for cardiovascular disease related to oral contraceptive use are those with a family history of hyperlipidemia, gestational or overt diabetics, hypertensives, and smokers over the age of 35. The gradual reduction by manufacturers of the steroid content of oral contraceptives appears to have lessened the incidence of adverse effects. Our current knowledge of risk factors permits the clinician to reduce exposure to oral contraceptive-related mortality by as much as 86 per cent. As we continue to search for ways to reduce risk among oral contraceptive users, it is important to note that more than 25 per cent of women are still taking formulations containing 50 micrograms of estrogen. It becomes the responsibility of the practicing physician to "step-down" these patients to lower-dose preparations such as the multiphasics. Such preparations also represent optimal therapy for first-time pill users.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11091988>Implantable contraception.</a></h2><p>Although  contraceptive implants have been available for over 15 years, innovations have only recently led to a wider choice. These new implants offer easier insertion and removal and other advantages depending on the type of progestin. Implants prevent pregnancy by several mechanisms, including inhibition of ovulation and luteal function and alteration of cervical mucus and the endometrium. The high efficacy and ease of maintenance make implants an ideal contraceptive for many women, including adolescents, a population that uses implants infrequently but reports high satisfaction. Implants are appropriate for women who are breastfeeding, who have contraindications to estrogen, or who have diseases such as , hypertension, sickle cell anemia, or an HIV infection because implants have few metabolic or hematologic effects. Long-term use has not been associated with a decrease in BMD and generally leads to increased blood levels and iron stores. Women who wish to space their pregnancies appreciate the nearly immediate onset of action with insertion and the rapid termination of all effects with removal. All types of implants lead to menstrual changes and other side effects in some women. Adverse effects that occur in implant users more than the general population include headaches and acne. Women must be thoroughly counseled regarding the potential for menstrual alteration, side effects, and sexually transmitted infections if they do not use condoms. Despite their initial high cost, implants are a cost-effective method over several years, even when discontinued before the life of the implant.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7621688>Insulin sensitivity is unaltered by the use of the Norplant subdermal implant contraceptive.</a></h2><p>Prior evaluations of carbohydrate metabolism in Norplant implant users, using the oral glucose tolerance test, have shown mild but clinically insignificant deterioration of insulin sensitivity. Using the more sensitive insulin tolerance test, the effects of the Norplant implant system on insulin sensitivity was studied in normal women. Insulin tolerance tests were performed before Norplant implant insertion in ten ovulatory female volunteers and repeated after 12 weeks of use. Both fasting glucose and fasting insulin values were similar before and after the use of Norplant implants. There was no significant difference in either the Kitt glucose value or the Kitt insulin value at baseline and at 3 months of use. Furthermore, the insulin-to-glucose ratio did not differ before and after the use of Norplant implants. There was a significant correlation with BMI and Kitt glucose value (r = -0.45, p < .05), as well as between fasting insulin and BMI (r = 0.6, p = 0.006). In the first three months of use, the -containing implant system, Norplant, does not affect sensitivity to insulin or glucose in normal, nondiabetic women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9617537>Hormonal contraception and risk of cardiovascular disease. An international perspective.</a></h2><p>The most frequent major adverse effect of hormonal contraception is an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The effect on the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI) differs and is strongly influenced by smoking and the presence of other cardiovascular risks factors, such as hypertension and . The incidence of each disease rises with age and there are differences in risk among hormonal contraceptive preparations. This article provides a framework within which to assess the balance of risks among types of hormonal contraceptives according to individual circumstances. Data on cardiovascular disease mortality rates in women of reproductive age in different countries of the world were compiled from nationally reported statistics and supplemented where possible with reported disease incidence rates. Risks associated with current use of hormonal contraception were compiled from the most recent publications on the cardiovascular effects of steroid hormone contraception. These were combined to estimate the total cardiovascular incidence and mortality according to baseline cardiovascular risk and individual characteristics. Mortality rates for cardiovascular diseases are very low in women of reproductive age. Myocardial infarction mortality rates rise from < 0.4 per 100,000 woman-years at age 15-24 years to the range 2 to 7 per 100,000 woman-years at age 35-44 years. Stroke mortality rates similarly rise steeply with age and are between 3 and 5 times higher than those for MI. VTE mortality rates rise less steeply with age and are approximately one-tenth the MI mortality rates at age 35-44 years. The adverse effect of oral contraceptives (OC) on the risk of VTE is the most important contributor to the total number of cardiovascular cases attributable to OC use. The increased risk of stroke and MI dominate the patterns of mortality in OC users and smokers. The additional risks attributable to smoking are greater than the additional risks attributable to OC use. The risk attributable to OC use in women < 35 years of age is small, even if they smoke, but there are substantially increased risks in older women who both smoke and use OC. The additional mortality attributable to OC use can be reduced by screening users, as this results in lower relative risks of ischemic stroke and MI. Differences between OC types in the relative risk of VTE contribute little to the total cardiovascular mortality associated with OC use, even though the total number of cardiovascular events is increased. A potential reduction in the risk of MI with desogestrel and gestodene compared with -containing OC would have little difference on overall mortality rates in women in their 20s and 30s, but may result in a net reduction in OC-attributable mortality in women aged 40-44 years who smoke. An overall quantification of the risks for different types of oral contraceptive users is necessary for an informed choice of contraceptive method, and any assessment of the balance of cardiovascular risks is complex. The model provides a tool to assess, at the level of the individual, the risks associated with use of different OC according to personal circumstances. It is important to consider the user's age and smoking status when determining OC attributable risks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21228406>Treatment with liraglutide--a once-daily GLP-1 analog--does not reduce the bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol/ taken as an oral combination contraceptive drug.</a></h2><p>Liraglutide is a once-daily human GLP-1 analog for treatment of type 2 diabetes. Like other GLP-1 analogs, liraglutide delays gastric emptying, which could potentially affect absorption of concomitantly administered oral drugs. This study investigated the effect of liraglutide on the pharmacokinetics of the components of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol/). Postmeno-pausal healthy women (n = 21) were included. A single dose of this contraceptive was administered. Blood samples for ethinyl estradiol/ measurements were drawn until 74 hours post dosing of the contraceptive during liraglutide and placebo treatments. The 90% confidence interval (CI) of the ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) (1.06; 90% CI, 0.99-1.13) for ethinyl estradiol (during liraglutide and placebo) was within defined limits, demonstrating equivalence.

A wide variety of contraceptives are available for these women. However hormonal contraceptives might influence carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and increase micro- and macrovascular complications. So caution in selecting a contraceptive method is required.To investigate whether progestogen-only, combined estrogen/progestogen or non-hormonal contraceptives differ in terms of effectiveness in preventing pregnancy, in their side effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and in long-term complications such as micro- and macrovascular disease, when used in women with .The search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL/CCTR, POPLINE, CINAHL, WorldCat, ECO, ArticleFirst, the Science Citation Index, the British Library Inside, and reference lists of relevant articles. Last search was performed in May 2005. In addition, experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies marketing contraceptives were contacted to identify published, unpublished or ongoing studies.Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that studied women with  comparing: 1. hormonal versus non-hormonal contraceptives. 2. progestogen-only versus estrogen/progestogen contraceptives. 3. contraceptives containing <50 microg estrogen versus contraceptives containing > or = 50 microg estrogen. 4. contraceptives containing 'first'-, 'second'- and 'third'-generation progestogens, drospirenone and cyproterone acetate. Principal outcomes were contraceptive effectiveness,  control, lipid metabolism and micro- and macrovascular complications.Two investigators evaluated the titles and abstracts from the literature search. Quality assessment was performed independently with discrepancies resolved by discussion or consulting a third reviewer. Because the trials differed in studied contraceptives, participant characteristics and methodological quality, we could not combine the data in a meta-analysis. The trials were therefore examined on an individual basis and narrative summaries were provided.Three randomised controlled trials were included. Only one was of good methodological quality. It compared the influence of -releasing IUD versus copper-IUD on carbohydrate metabolism in women with type 1 . No difference was found in daily insulin requirement, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or fasting blood sugar after twelve months. The other two trials were of limited methodological quality. Both compared progestogen-only pills with different estrogen/progestogen combinations. The trials reported blood glucose levels to remain stable during treatment with most regimens. Only high-dose combined oral contraceptives were found to slightly impair glucose homeostasis. Combined oral contraceptives also appeared to have a minor adverse effect on lipid metabolism whereas progestogen-only contraceptives slightly improved lipid-metabolism. Only one study reported on micro- and macrovascular complications. No signs or symptoms of thromboembolic incidents or visual disturbances were observed. However study duration was short. Minor adverse effects were reported in one study. The trial found progestogen-only pills to cause more bleeding irregularities when compared with combined oral contraceptives. Unintended pregnancies were not observed during any of the studies.The three included randomised controlled trials in this systematic review provided insufficient evidence to assess whether progestogen-only and combined contraceptives differ from non-hormonal contraceptives in  control, lipid metabolism and complications. Two of the three studies were of limited methodological quality, sponsored by pharmaceutical companies and described surrogate outcomes. Ideally, an adequately reported, high-quality randomised controlled trial analysing both intermediate outcomes (i.e. glucose and lipid metabolism) and true clinical endpoints (micro- and macrovascular disease) in users of combined, progestogen-only and non-hormonal contraceptives should be conducted. However, due to the low incidence of micro- and macrovascular disease and accordingly the large sample size and follow-up period needed to observe differences in risk, a randomised controlled trial might not be the ideal design.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3766633>Oral contraceptives and insulin receptor binding in normal women and those with previous gestational .</a></h2><p>The effect of a low-dose triphasic oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol and ) on glucose tolerance, plasma insulin response to a glucose challenge, and insulin receptor binding to monocytes and erythrocytes was investigated in seven women with previous gestational  and seven nondiabetic control subjects.

Oral contraceptives may be co-administered with antidiabetic agents over long periods of time, therefore potential drug-drug interactions between oral contraceptives and antidiabetic drugs should be investigated.The effect of multiple oral doses of empagliflozin 25 mg once daily (qd) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of the combined oral contraceptive ethinylestradiol (EE) 30 μg/ (LNG) 150 μg qd was investigated.This was a phase I, open-label, two-period, fixed sequence study.The study was performed at the Human Pharmacology Centre/Department of Translational Medicine, Boehringer Ingelheim, Biberach, Germany.Eighteen healthy premenopausal women participated in the study.There was a mandatory run-in period in which participants received EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg qd for 21-48 days followed by a treatment-free interval of 7 days. Participants then received EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg qd for 14 days (reference; period 1), followed by EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg qd plus empagliflozin 25 mg qd for 7 days (test; period 2).The pharmacokinetics of EE and LNG at steady state based on the primary endpoints of area under the steady-state plasma concentration-time curve during a dosage interval τ (AUC(τ,ss)) and maximum steady-state plasma concentration during a dosage interval (C (max,ss)) were the main outcome measures.The pharmacokinetics of EE and LNG were not affected by co-administration with empagliflozin. Geometric mean ratios (90 % CI) of AUC(τ,ss) and C (max,ss) for EE were 102.82 % (97.58, 108.35) and 99.22 % (93.40, 105.39), respectively. For LNG, these values were 101.94 % (98.54, 105.47) and 105.81 % (99.47, 112.55), respectively. The 90 % CIs were within the standard bioequivalence boundaries of 80-125 %. There were no relevant changes in the time to reach peak levels (t (max,ss)) or terminal elimination half-life (t (½,ss)) of EE and LNG between test and reference treatments. Ten women in each treatment had at least one adverse event (AE). Severe AEs were reported by three women in the reference period and one woman in the test period. There were no serious AEs or premature discontinuations.The combination of EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg and empagliflozin 25 mg was well tolerated. Based on standard bioequivalence criteria, empagliflozin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of EE and LNG, indicating that no dose adjustment of EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg is required when empagliflozin is co-administered.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3282811>Oral contraceptives: effects on glucose and lipid metabolism in insulin-dependent diabetic women and women with previous gestational .

Today most oral contraceptives contain less tha 50 microgram of estrogen. Furthermore, prescribing practices have improved so that most women with risk factors are not taking oral contraceptives. No differences in risk of fatal myocardial infarctions could be demonstrated by women taking 50 microgram estrogen products versus those taking products with lower estrogen dosages. Perhaps this result reflects small numbers of patients in the study, or perhaps it reflects an effect of progestogen.

Involvement of lipids in chronic cardiovascular conditions, plus long-term use of oral contraceptive tablets, prompted this first 24-cycle study of the effect of triphasic formulations on young women.69 women assigned randomly to an ethinyl estradiol/ formulation (Triphasil) or an ethinyl estradiol/norethindrone formulation (Ortho 7/7/7) and 25 control women (no hormonal contraception) had blood sampled for lipids and lipoproteins pre-trial, and at 3- or 6-cycle intervals for 24 cycles.At cycle 24, control women experienced no significant change from baseline in any variable except apolipoprotein B (apo B). Plasma apo B increased 42% (P < .01), reflecting the LDL apo B increase (42%, P < .01). Both combination formulations significantly increased apo B (plasma, VLDL, IDL and LDL); the increases ranged between 47% and 84%. Plasma apo A1 rose (15%, P < .001) in the Ortho 7/7/7 group only.

All cycle-24 lipid and lipoprotein values remained well within respective normal ranges.Although 2-year exposure to the triphasic oral contraceptive formulations changed the lipid risk factors for cardiovascular disease only within normal ranges, there remains potential for long-term health effects when compounded with other risk factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27758048>Urinary steroid profile in females - the impact of menstrual cycle and emergency contraceptives.</a></h2><p>Today's doping tests involving longitudinal monitoring of steroid profiles are difficult in women. Women have more complex hormonal fluctuations than men and commonly take drugs such as hormonal contraceptives that are shown to affect biomarkers used in these doping tests. In this study, we followed six women's urinary steroid profile during one menstrual cycle, including both glucuronides and sulfate conjugated fractions. Additionally, we studied what happens to the steroidal module of the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP) after administration of an emergency contraceptive (, NorLevo®). The study shows that there are large individual variations in all metabolites included in the ABP and that the administration of emergency contraceptives may lead to suspicious steroid profile findings in the ABP. Urinary epitestosterone concentration increased during the menstrual cycle, leading to a decrease in the testosterone/epitestosterone ratio. The ratios followed in the ABP varied widely throughout the menstrual cycle, the coefficient of variation (CV) ranging from 4 to 99%. There was a 3-fold decrease in epitestosterone 24 h post administration of the emergency contraceptive pill and androsterone, etiocholanolone, and 5β- androstan-3α,17β-diol concentrations decreased about 2-fold. When analyzed with the ABP software, one of the six women had an atypical profile after taking the emergency contraceptive. Furthermore, we could not find any alterations in excretion routes (i.e., if the metabolites are excreted as glucuronide or sulfate conjugates) during the menstrual cycle or after administration of emergency contraceptive, indicating no direct effect on phase II enzymes.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1679421>Contraceptive options for the gestational diabetic woman.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8032371>[Norplant contraception at the Rabta Tunis maternity hospital].</a></h2><p>612 women had the benefit of contraceptive implants in the Maternity Hospital of La Rabta in Tunis over a period of 5 years (1988-1992). This study aimed at analysing the tolerance of this method by studying a group of 508 normal women and 104 women at risk (58 women were heart-diseased, 22 nursing, 13 diabetic, 11 hypertensive). The typical woman in this group is thirty years old, having 3 children, and weighing 61 kg. The implants were most of the cases withdrawn because of problems related to the menstrual cycle that were observed in 37% of the cases, equally distributed among both groups of the series. Contraceptive implants failed in 1.79% of the cases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3111786>Glucose and lipid metabolism with triphasic oral contraceptives in women with history of gestational .</a></h2><p>The glucose and lipid metabolism in a group of women with previous history of gestational  were evaluated before and after 6 months treatment with a low-dose triphasic oral contraceptives pill (TP). This group was compared with a control group of women, also with history of gestational , using intrauterine devices (IUD). In the TP group, 26.7% of the women developed impaired glucose tolerance which reverted to normal in all but one after cessation of the TP. The IUD group showed no change in glucose tolerance. The integrated insulin response to a 75g OGTT in the TP group increased by 48.3% at 6 months compared with an increase of 23.4% for the same period in the IUD group. In the TP group there was a significant decrease in serum total cholesterol without changes in HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides level. We conclude that even low-dose triphasic oral contraceptive pills can cause glucose intolerance in women with previous gestational .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3117491>Recovery of fertility and outcome of planned pregnancies after the removal of Norplant subdermal implants or Copper-T IUDs.</a></h2><p>The recovery of fertility after discontinuation of NORPLANT implant use was assessed in ninety women who stated a desire for a new child at the time of removal. Three subjects were lost to follow-up after removal. The cumulative probability of conception in the remaining 87 women was 25, 49, 73 and 86 percent at one, three, six and twelve months after removal, respectively. Nine observations were censored either because of the use of a contraceptive method soon after removal of the implants (n = 7) or separation (n = 2). All other cases were pregnant at the end of two years with exception of three subjects where a male factor for infertility was present. There was no significant correlation between the length of NORPLANT use and the length of the interval from removal to conception. A significantly higher frequency of intervals longer than 6 months was observed among women older than 30 years as compared to younger women. Pathology during pregnancy was cholestasia (n = 5), hypertension (n = 1) and gestational  (n = 1). The outcome was term delivery in 59 cases, premature delivery in 4 cases, and spontaneous abortion in 7 cases. One woman is still pregnant and the outcome is unknown in 4 cases. One premature infant died. A contemporary control group of Copper T users enrolled under the same criteria as NORPLANT implant users provided 44 women who had the device removed to become pregnant. The cumulative probability of pregnancy was 27, 69, 84 and 89 at one, three, six and twelve months and all were pregnant by the end of the second year. Six censored observations occurred because of the use of another contraceptive method after removal (n = 3) or loss to follow-up (n = 3). The outcome of pregnancy was term delivery in 23 cases and abortion in 7 cases. Recovery of fertility occurred at a normal rate after NORPLANT implant removal and the incidence of problems detected in the ensuing pregnancy were within the expected range for Chilean women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24788670>Steroidal contraceptives: effect on carbohydrate metabolism in women without .</a></h2><p>Many hormonal contraceptives have been associated with changes in carbohydrate metabolism. Alterations may include decreased glucose tolerance and increased insulin resistance, which are risk factors for Type 2  and cardiovascular disease. These issues have been raised primarily with contraceptives containing estrogen.To evaluate the effect of hormonal contraceptives on carbohydrate metabolism in healthy women and those at risk for  due to overweight.In April 2014, we searched the computerized databases MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, and LILACS for studies of hormonal contraceptives and carbohydrate metabolism. We also searched for clinical trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. The initial search also included EMBASE.All randomized controlled trials were considered if they examined carbohydrate metabolism in women without  who used hormonal contraceptives for contraception. Comparisons could be a placebo, a non-hormonal contraceptive, or another hormonal contraceptive that differed in drug, dosage, or regimen. Interventions included at least three cycles. Outcomes included glucose and insulin measures.We assessed all titles and abstracts identified during the literature searches. The data were extracted and entered into RevMan. We wrote to researchers for missing data. For continuous variables, the mean difference (MD) was computed with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model. For dichotomous outcomes, the Peto odds ratio with 95% CI was calculated.We found 31 trials that met the inclusion criteria. No new trials were eligible in 2014. Twenty-one trials compared combined oral contraceptives (COCs); others examined different COC regimens, progestin-only pills, injectables, a vaginal ring, and implants. None included a placebo. Of 34 comparisons, eight had any notable difference between the study groups in an outcome.Twelve trials studied desogestrel-containing COCs, and the few differences from  COCs were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of two studies showed the desogestrel group had a higher mean fasting glucose (MD 0.20; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.41). Where data could not be combined, single studies showed lower mean fasting glucose (MD -0.40; 95% CI -0.72 to -0.08) and higher means for two-hour glucose response (MD 1.08; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.71) and insulin area under the curve (AUC) (MD 20.30; 95% CI 4.24 to 36.36).Three trials examined the etonogestrel vaginal ring and one examined an etonogestrel implant. One trial showed the ring group had lower mean AUC insulin than the -COC group (MD -204.51; 95% CI -389.64 to -19.38).Of eight trials of norethisterone preparations, five compared COCs and three compared injectables. In a COC trial, a norethisterone group had smaller mean change in glucose two-hour response than a -COC group (MD -0.30; 95% CI -0.54 to -0.06). In an injectable study, a group using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate had higher means than the group using norethisterone enanthate for fasting glucose (MD 10.05; 95% CI 3.16 to 16.94), glucose two-hour response (MD 17.00; 95% CI 5.67 to 28.33), and fasting insulin (MD 3.40; 95% CI 2.07 to 4.73).Among five recent trials, two examined newer COCs with different estrogen types. One showed the group with nomegestrel acetate plus 17β-estradiol had lower means than the  group for incremental AUC glucose (MD -1.43; 95% CI -2.55 to -0.31) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (MD -0.10; 95% CI -0.18 to -0.02). Two trials compared extended versus conventional (cyclic) regimens. With a dienogest COC, an extended-use group had greater mean change in AUC glucose (MD 82.00; 95% CI 10.72 to 153.28). In a small trial using two  COCs, the lower-dose group showed smaller mean change in fasting glucose (MD -3.00; 95% CI -5.89 to -0.11), but the obese and normal weight women did not differ significantly.Current evidence suggests no major differences in carbohydrate metabolism between different hormonal contraceptives in women without . We cannot make strong statements due to having few studies that compared the same types of contraceptives. Many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses. Many of the earlier studies had limited reporting of methods.We still know very little about women at risk for metabolic problems due to being overweight. More than half of the trials had weight restrictions as inclusion criteria. Only one small trial stratified the groups by body mass index (obese versus normal).</p></html>
