The study of the physiological/molecular mechanisms, mediating the responses to the monitoring of the GIT contents, has been referred to as chemosensory science. While most of the progress in this area of research has been obtained in laboratory rodents and humans, significant steps forward have also been reported in pigs. The objective of this review was to update the current knowledge on nutrient chemosensing in pigs in light of recent advances in humans and laboratory rodents. A second objective relates to informing the existence of nutrient sensors with their functionality, particularly linked to the  peptides relevant to the onset/offset of appetite. Several cell types of the intestinal  such as Paneth, goblet, tuft and enteroendocrine cells (EECs) contain subsets of chemosensory receptors also found on the tongue as part of the taste system. In particular, EECs show specific co-expression patterns between nutrient sensors and/or transceptors (transport proteins with sensing functions) and anorexigenic hormones such as cholecystokinin (CCK), peptide   (PYY) or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), amongst others. In addition, the administration of bitter compounds has an inhibitory effect on GIT motility and on appetite through GLP-1-, CCK-, ghrelin- and PYY-labelled EECs in the human small intestine and colon. Furthermore, the mammalian chemosensory system is the target of some bacterial metabolites. Recent studies on the human microbiome have discovered that commensal bacteria have developed strategies to stimulate chemosensory receptors and trigger host cellular functions. Finally, the study of gene polymorphisms related to nutrient sensors explains differences in food choices, food intake and appetite between individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30197089>IRTKS (BAIAP2L1) Elongates Epithelial Microvilli Using EPS8-Dependent and Independent Mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Transporting epithelial cells like those that line the  build large arrays of actin-supported protrusions called microvilli, which extend from the apical surface into luminal spaces to increase functional surface area. Although critical for maintaining physiological homeostasis, mechanisms controlling the formation of microvilli remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the inverse-bin-amphiphysin-Rvs (I-BAR)-domain-containing protein insulin receptor  kinase substrate (IRTKS) (also known as BAIAP2L1) promotes the growth of epithelial microvilli. Super-resolution microscopy and live imaging of differentiating epithelial cells revealed that IRTKS localizes to the distal tips of actively growing microvilli via a mechanism that requires its N-terminal I-BAR domain. At microvillar tips, IRTKS promotes elongation through a mechanism involving its C-terminal actin-binding WH2 domain. IRTKS can also drive microvillar elongation using its SH3 domain to recruit the bundling protein EPS8 to microvillar tips. These results provide new insight on mechanisms that control microvillar growth during the differentiation of transporting epithelial cells and help explain why IRTKS is targeted by enteric pathogens that disrupt microvillar structure during infection of the intestinal .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Its importance is underscored by the effects of its mutation in Hirschsprung disease, leading to absence of  innervation and severe gastrointestinal symptoms. We report a new and physiologically significant site of Ret expression in the intestine: the intestinal . Experiments in  indicate that Ret is expressed both by enteric neurons and adult intestinal epithelial progenitors, which require Ret to sustain their proliferation. Mechanistically, Ret is engaged in a positive feedback loop with Wnt/Wingless signalling, modulated by Src and Fak kinases. We find that Ret is also expressed by the developing intestinal  of mice, where its expression is maintained into the adult stage in a subset of enteroendocrine/enterochromaffin cells. Mouse organoid experiments point to an intrinsic role for Ret in promoting epithelial maturation and regulating Wnt signalling. Our findings reveal evolutionary conservation of the positive Ret/Wnt signalling feedback in both developmental and homeostatic contexts. They also suggest an epithelial contribution to  loss-of-function disorders such as Hirschsprung disease.© 2017 The Authors.

SCFA (formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate) are formed by the anaerobic carbohydrates fermentation and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA), such as isobutyric and isovaleric acids, are derived from amino acids valine and leucine. Phenylcarboxylic acids (PCA), such as phenylacetic acid (PAA), phenyipropionic acid (PPA), phenyllactic acid (PLA) and some other acids, are metabolites of amino acids phenylalanine and  involved in host adaptation and regulation. ma unique experiment, the authors first examined effect of the carboxylic acids on host cell proliferation in organotypic tissue cultures (rat spleen explants). The study showed that almost all biogenic aliphatic carboxylic acids have a positive effect on cell proliferation in rat spleen tissue. This fundamentally distinguishes them from amino acids, many of which have an inhibitory effect at the same concentrations. These findings suggest that SCFA, including hydrox~ and oxo derivatives, can act as positive regulators of host immune tissues. Some SCFA (for example, butyric acid), stimulate proliferation of normal host cells (immune tissue, intestinal ), but inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells ('butyrate paradox'). Unlike SCFA, phenylcarboxylic acids have a negative effect on host immune tissues explants and induce apoptosis. These data confirm the potential contribution of phenylcarboxylic acids in the pathogenesis of chronic disorders associated with impaired immune response, including autoimmune diseases. The authors suggest that PCA may serve as early metabolic markers of sepsis, immune-related diseases and chronic inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (iBD), colorectal cancer, chronic kidney disease and liver, secondary imrnunodeficiency. It can be assumed that carboxylic acids are evolutionary precursors of amino acids that have a wide variety of functions and able to modulate not only proliferation but also apoptosis. The results agree well with the data obtained in the study of Actoflor-C (microbial metabolites complex) and can be used to study mechanisms of action of probiotic strains and metabiotics (e.g. butyrate and propionate-containing formulations), as well as for the development of innovative medicines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604999>Small molecule FAK activator promotes human intestinal epithelial monolayer wound closure and mouse ulcer healing.</a></h2><p>GI mucosal healing requires epithelial sheet migration. The non-receptor  kinase focal adhesion kinase (FAK) stimulates epithelial motility. A virtual screen identified the small drug-like FAK mimic ZINC40099027, which activates FAK. We assessed whether ZINC40099027 promotes FAK-Tyr-397 phosphorylation and wound healing in Caco-2 monolayers and two mouse intestinal injury models. Murine small bowel ulcers were generated by topical serosal acetic acid or subcutaneous indomethacin in C57BL/6J mice. One day later, we began treatment with ZINC40099027 or DMSO, staining the mucosa for phosphorylated FAK and Ki-67 and measuring mucosal ulcer area, serum creatinine, ALT, and body weight at day 4. ZINC40099027 (10-1000 nM) dose-dependently activated FAK phosphorylation, without activating Pyk2-Tyr-402 or Src-Tyr-419. ZINC40099027 did not stimulate proliferation, and stimulated wound closure independently of proliferation. The FAK inhibitor PF-573228 prevented ZINC40099027-stimulated wound closure. In both mouse ulcer models, ZINC40099027accelerated mucosal wound healing. FAK phosphorylation was increased in jejunal  at the ulcer edge, and Ki-67 staining was unchanged in jejunal mucosa. ZINC40099027 serum concentration at sacrifice resembled the effective concentration in vitro. Weight, creatinine and ALT did not differ between groups. Small molecule FAK activators can specifically promote epithelial restitution and mucosal healing and may be useful to treat  mucosal injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26010764>Depressed perivascular sensory innervation of mouse mesenteric arteries with advanced age.</a></h2><p>The dilatory role for sensory innervation of mesenteric arteries (MAs) is impaired in Old (∼24 months) versus Young (∼4 months) mice. We investigated the nature of this impairment in isolated pressurized MAs. With perivascular sensory nerve stimulation, dilatation and inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstriction observed in Young MAs were lost in Old MAs along with impaired dilatation to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Inhibiting NO and prostaglandin synthesis increased CGRP EC50 in Young and Old MAs. Endothelial denudation attenuated dilatation to CGRP in Old MAs yet enhanced dilatation to CGRP in Young MAs while abolishing all dilatations to ACh. In Old MAs, sensory nerve density was reduced and RAMP1 (CGRP receptor component) associated with nuclear regions of endothelial cells in a manner not seen in Young MAs or in smooth muscle cells of either age. With advanced age, loss of dilatory signalling mediated through perivascular sensory nerves may compromise perfusion of visceral organs.Vascular dysfunction and sympathetic nerve activity increase with advancing age. In the , blood flow is governed by perivascular sensory and sympathetic nerves but little is known of how their functional role is affected by advanced age. We tested the hypothesis that functional sensory innervation of mesenteric arteries (MAs) is impaired for Old (24 months) versus Young (4 months) C57BL/6 male mice. In cannulated pressurized MAs preconstricted 50% with noradrenaline and treated with guanethidine (to inhibit sympathetic neurotransmission), perivascular nerve stimulation (PNS) evoked dilatation in Young but not Old MAs while dilatations to ACh were not different between age groups. In Young MAs, capsaicin (to inhibit sensory neurotransmission) blocked dilatation and increased constriction during PNS. With no difference in efficacy, the EC50 of CGRP as a vasodilator was ∼6-fold greater in Old versus Young MAs. Inhibiting nitric oxide (l-NAME) and prostaglandin (indomethacin) synthesis increased CGRP EC50 in both age groups. Endothelial denudation reduced the efficacy of dilatation to CGRP by ∼30% in Old MAs yet increased this efficacy ∼15% in Young MAs while all dilatations to ACh were abolished. Immunolabelling revealed reduced density of sensory (CGRP) but not sympathetic ( hydroxylase) innervation for Old versus Young MAs. Whereas the distribution of CGRP receptor proteins was similar in SMCs, RAMP1 associated with nuclear regions of endothelial cells of Old but not Young MAs. With advanced age, the loss of sensory nerve function and diminished effectiveness of CGRP as a vasodilator is multifaceted and may adversely affect splanchnic perfusion.© 2015 The Authors.

To repair damage, intestinal epithelial cells must rapidly spread and migrate to cover exposed lamina propria, events that involve redox signaling. Wounds are subject to extensive redox alterations, particularly resulting from H2O2 produced in the adjacent tissue by both the  and emigrating leukocytes. The mechanisms governing these processes are not fully understood, particularly at the level of protein signaling. Crk-associated substrate, or Cas, is an important signaling protein known to modulate focal adhesion and actin cytoskeletal dynamics, whose association with Crk is regulated by Abl kinase, a ubiquitously expressed  kinase. We sought to evaluate the role of Abl regulation of Cas at the level of cell spreading and migration during wound closure. As a model, we used intestinal epithelial cells exposed to H2O2 or scratch wounded to assess the Abl-Cas signaling pathway. We characterized the localization of phosphorylated Cas in mouse colonic  under baseline conditions and after biopsy wounding the mucosa. Analysis of actin and focal adhesion dynamics by microscopy or biochemical analysis after manipulating Abl kinase revealed that Abl controls redox-dependent Cas phosphorylation and localization to influence cell spreading and migration. Collectively, our data shed new light on redox-sensitive protein signaling modules controlling intestinal wound healing.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25796561>Purification of dendritic cell and macrophage subsets from the normal mouse small intestine.</a></h2><p>Mononuclear phagocytes are essential for protecting against pathogens breaching the intestinal mucosa and maintaining the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract. The mononuclear phagocyte family of the healthy intestine is represented by a small population of hematopoietic cells including dendritic cells and macrophages. Distinct mononuclear phagocyte subsets strategically accumulate within and below the mucosal  and are distributed in the submucosa and muscularis externa. Shaped by its unique microenvironment, each mononuclear phagocyte subset is developmentally and functionally unique and phenotypically distinct. Here we summarize our recent advances on identifying and purifying various intestinal mononuclear phagocyte subsets by flow cytometry in the context of their developmental properties and location within the intestinal tissue.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) is suggested as a risk factor for inflammatory bowel disease. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Intestinal biopsies from Per1/2 mutant and wild-type (WT) mice were investigated by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and bromodeoxyuridine pulse-chase experiments. TNF-α was injected intraperitoneally, with or without necrostatin-1, into Per1/2 mice or rhythmic and externally desynchronized WT mice to study intestinal epithelial cell death. Experimental chronic colitis was induced by oral administration of dextran sodium sulfate. , caspase activity was assayed in Per1/2-specific small interfering RNA-transfected cells.  was overexpressed to study antiapoptosis and the cell cycle. Genetic ablation of circadian clock function or environmental CRD in mice increased susceptibility to severe intestinal inflammation and epithelial dysregulation, accompanied by excessive necroptotic cell death and a reduced number of secretory epithelial cells. Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase (RIP)-3-mediated intestinal necroptosis was linked to increased mitotic cell cycle arrest  Per1/2-controlled Wee1, resulting in increased antiapoptosis  cellular inhibitor of apoptosis-2. Together, our data suggest that circadian rhythm stability is pivotal for the maintenance of mucosal barrier function. CRD increases intestinal necroptosis, thus rendering the   more susceptible to inflammatory processes.-Pagel, R., Bär, F., Schröder, T., Sünderhauf, A., Künstner, A., Ibrahim, S. M., Autenrieth, S.

In a murine colitis model, the helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri prevents colitis via induction of regulatory dendritic cells (DCs). The mechanism driving the development of these regulatory DCs is unexplored. There is decreased expression of the intracellular signaling pathway spleen  kinase (Syk) in intestinal DCs from H. polygyrus bakeri-infected mice. To explore the importance of this observation, it was shown that intestinal DCs from DC-specific Syk(-/-) mice were powerful inhibitors of murine colitis, suggesting that loss of Syk was sufficient to convert these cells into their regulatory phenotype. DCs sense  flora and damaged  via expression of C-type lectin receptors, many of which signal through the Syk signaling pathway. It was observed that  DCs express mRNA encoding for C-type lectin (CLEC) 7A, CLEC9A, CLEC12A, and CLEC4N. H. polygyrus bakeri infection downmodulated CLEC mRNA expression in these cells. Focusing on CLEC7A, which encodes for the dectin-1 receptor, flow analysis showed that H. polygyrus bakeri decreases dectin-1 expression on the intestinal DC subsets that drive Th1/Th17 development. DCs become unresponsive to the dectin-1 agonist curdlan and fail to phosphorylate Syk after agonist stimulation. Soluble worm products can block CLEC7A and Syk mRNA expression in  DCs from uninfected mice after a brief in vitro exposure. Thus, downmodulation of Syk expression and phosphorylation in intestinal DCs could be important mechanisms through which helminths induce regulatory DCs that limit colitis.Copyright © 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29440671>Impaired airway mucociliary function reduces antigen-specific IgA immune response to immunization with a claudin-4-targeting nasal vaccine in mice.</a></h2><p>Vaccine delivery is an essential element for the development of mucosal vaccine, but it remains to be investigated how physical barriers such as mucus and cilia affect vaccine delivery efficacy. Previously, we reported that C-terminal fragment of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (C-CPE) targeted claudin-4, which is expressed by the  associated with nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), and could be effective as a nasal vaccine delivery. Mice lacking tubulin  ligase-like family, member 1 (Ttll1-KO mice) showed mucus accumulation in nasal cavity due to the impaired motility of respiratory cilia. Ttll1-KO mice nasally immunized with C-CPE fused to pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA-C-CPE) showed reduced PspA-specific nasal IgA responses, impaired germinal center formation, and decreased germinal center B-cells and follicular helper T cells in the NALT. Although there was no change in the expression of claudin-4 in the NALT  in Ttll1-KO mice, the  was covered by a dense mucus that prevented the binding of PspA-C-CPE to NALT. However, administration of expectorant N-acetylcysteine removed the mucus and rescued the PspA-specific nasal IgA response. These results show that the accumulation of mucus caused by impaired respiratory cilia function is an interfering factor in the C-CPE-based claudin-4-targeting nasal vaccine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30455690>ATF3 Sustains IL-22-Induced STAT3 Phosphorylation to Maintain Mucosal Immunity Through Inhibiting Phosphatases.</a></h2><p>In  , IL-22 transmits signals through STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3) which provides intestinal immunity. Many components in the IL-22-pSTAT3 pathway have been identified as risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and some of them are considered as promising therapeutic targets. However, new perspectives are still needed to understand IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling for effective clinical interventions in IBD patients. Here, we revealed activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), recently identified to be upregulated in patients with active IBD, as a crucial player in the epithelial IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling cascade. We found ATF3 is central to intestinal homeostasis and provides protection during colitis. Loss of ATF3 led to decreased crypt numbers, more shortened colon length, impaired ileal fucosylation at the steady state, and lethal disease activity during DSS-induced colitis which can be effectively ameliorated by rectal transplantation of wild-type colonic organoids. Epithelial stem cells and Paneth cells form a niche to orchestrate epithelial regeneration and host-microbe interactions, and IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling is a key guardian for this niche. We found ATF3 is critical for niche maintenance as ATF3 deficiency caused compromised stem cell growth and regeneration, as well as Paneth cell degeneration and loss of anti-microbial peptide (AMP)-producing granules, indicative of malfunction of Paneth/stem cell network. Mechanistically, we found IL-22 upregulates ATF3, which is required to relay IL-22 signaling leading to STAT3 phosphorylation and subsequent AMP induction. Intriguingly, ATF3 itself does not act on STAT3 directly, instead ATF3 regulates pSTAT3 by negatively targeting protein  phosphatases (PTPs) including SHP2 and PTP-Meg2. Furthermore, we identified ATF3 is also involved in IL-6-mediated STAT3 activation in T cells and loss of ATF3 leads to reduced capacity of Th17 cells to produce their signature cytokine IL-22 and IL-17A. Collectively, our results suggest that via IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling in the  and IL-6-pSTAT3 signaling in Th17 cells, ATF3 mediates a cross-regulation in the barrier to maintain mucosal homeostasis and immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25497601>Control of appetite and energy intake by SCFA: what are the potential underlying mechanisms?</a></h2><p>In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the role of dietary fibre in obesity management. Much of this interest stems from animal and human studies which suggest that an increased intake of fermentable fibre can suppress appetite and improve weight management. A growing number of reports have demonstrated that the principal products of colonic fermentation of dietary fibre, SCFA, contribute to energy homeostasis via effects on multiple cellular metabolic pathways and receptor-mediated mechanisms. In particular, over the past decade it has been identified that a widespread receptor system exists for SCFA. These G-protein-coupled receptors, free fatty acid receptor (FFAR) 2 and FFAR3 are expressed in numerous tissue sites, including the   and adipose tissue. Investigations using FFAR2- or FFAR3-deficient animal models suggest that SCFA-mediated stimulation of these receptors enhances the release of the anorectic hormones peptide   and glucagon-like peptide-1 from colonic L cells and leptin from adipocytes. In addition, the SCFA acetate has recently been shown to have a direct role in central appetite regulation. Furthermore, the SCFA propionate is a known precursor for hepatic glucose production, which has been reported to suppress feeding behaviour in ruminant studies through the stimulation of hepatic vagal afferents. The present review therefore proposes that an elevated colonic production of SCFA could stimulate numerous hormonal and neural signals at different organ and tissue sites that would cumulatively suppress short-term appetite and energy intake.</p></html>
