We examined 70 women in total, menopause duration they accounted for 1,95±1,1 years, it came both as natural, and as a result of a surgery. The main group included 40 women with MS with leading arthropathic . The patients' modified menopausal index was calculated (MMI), the functional condition of the joints was assessed on a scale-questionnaire with the calculation of the clinical-functional index of WOMAC; the quantitative content and qualitative composition of glycosaminoglycans in the serum, the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline and uronic acids were determined. To determine the degree of deviation from the control (standard) indicators was used non-parametric Mann-Whitney criterion and factor analysis (main components method). It was revealed that all patients have an increased content of glycosaminoglycans and glycoprotein in the blood, which corresponds to the general age-related rearrangement of connective tissue metabolism, but the patients of the main group have more expressed indictors, which corresponds to more severe dystrophic changes and the severity of clinical symptoms. Redistribution of the fractional composition of glycosaminoglycans towards the increase of chondroitin-6 sulfate in patients of the main group indicates the presence of pre-emptive destruction of cartilage. The arthropathic  availability also confirms the significant reduction CI- / CI-4s ratio and an increased content of chondroitin sulfates. Patients with a natural type of menopause showed more pronounced changes in connective tissue metabolites, in contrast to patients with surgical menopause еhat indicates a longer and more invasive pathologic course of natural menopause.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15173549>Phenotypic and genetic analyses of subcongenic BB.SHR rat lines shorten the region on chromosome 4 bearing gene(s) for underlying facets of .</a></h1><p>Congenic BB.SHR (D4Got41-Npy-Tacr1; BB.4S) rats develop an incomplete  with obesity, hyperleptinemia, and dyslipidemia compared with their progenitor strain, the diabetes-prone BB/OK rat. To narrow down the underlying gene(s), two subcongenic BB.SHR rat lines, briefly termed BB.4Sa and BB.4Sb, were generated. Male BB.4S (n = 20), BB.4Sa (n = 24), and BB.4Sb (n = 26) were longitudinally characterized for facets of the  and analyzed for expression of genes located in the region of interest in liver and blood. Body weight gain was comparable, serum triglycerides and leptin were significantly increased, and total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol ratio were decreased in BB.4S compared with both subcongenics. Serum insulin was significantly higher in BB.4S and BB.4Sa than in BB.4Sb. The adiposity index showed a graduated decrease from BB. to BB.4Sb. Obvious differences in relative expression were found in 6 of 10 genes in liver and in 2 of 9 genes in blood. Only one gene, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha kinase 3 (Eif2ak3 also called Perk or Pek), was significantly less expressed in liver and in blood of both subcongenic BB.4Sa and BB.4Sb compared with their "parental" BB.4S rats. Based on the phenotype and genotype in BB.4S and its subcongenic derivatives, the most important region on chromosome 4 can be said to lie between D4Got72 and Tacr1. Eif2ak3 is mapped in this region. Considering the function of Eif2ak3, it may be a candidate gene for the development of glucose intolerance found in both subcongenics but not in BB.4S. Allelic variants between BB/OK and SHR could influence Eif2ak3 function, possibly leading not only to glucose intolerance but also to the disturbances in hepatic and renal function found in human Wolcott-Rallison .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27017097>Subchronic administration of (R,S)-ketamine induces ketamine ring hydroxylation in Wistar rats.</a></h1><p>Subchronic administration of (R,S)-ketamine, (R,S)-Ket, is used in the treatment of neuropathic pain, in particular Complex Regional Pain , but the effect of this protocol on the metabolism of (R,S)-Ket is unknown. In this study, daily administration of a low dose of (R,S)-Ket for 14-days to Wistar rats was conducted to determine the impact of sub-chronic dosing on the pharmacokinetics of (R,S)-Ket and its major metabolites. The data indicate that, relative to a single administration of (R,S)-Ket, subchronic administration resulted in increased clearance of (R,S)-Ket and the N-demethylated metabolite norketamine measured as elimination half-life (t1/2) and decreased plasma concentrations of these compounds. Subchronic administration produced a slight decrease in t1/2 and an increase in plasma concentration of the major metabolite, (2S,;2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine, and produced significant increases in the plasma concentrations of the (2S,6R;2R,)-hydroxynorketamine and (2S,4R;2R,4S)-hydroxynorketamine metabolites. The metabolism of (R,S)-Ket predominately occurs via two microsomal enzyme-mediated pathways: (R,S)-Ket⇒(R,S)-norketamine⇒(2S,;2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine and (2S,4R;2R,4S)-hydroxynorketamine and the (R,S)-Ket⇒(2S,6R;2R,)-hydroxyketamine⇒(2S,6R;2R,)-hydroxynorketamine and (2S,;2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine. The results indicate that the activity of both  pathways are increased by subchronic administration of (R,S)-Ket producing new metabolite patterns and potential differences in clinical effects.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27679377>: Predictive Factor for Endometrial Polyps in Postmenopausal Women.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12649064>Determination of monosaccharides and disaccharides in mucopolysaccharidoses patients by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry.</a></h1><p>The mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of lysosomal storage disorders characterised by the storage of glycosaminoglycans. With the exception of Hunters  (MPS II), which is X-linked, they are autosomal recessively inherited resulting in a defect in any one of 10 lysosomal enzymes needed to catabolise glycosaminoglycans. The type and size of the glycosaminoglycans stored in lysosomes are determined by the particular enzyme deficiency. These glycosaminoglycan elevations are subsequently observed in tissue, circulation, and urine. A method has been developed for the derivatisation and quantification of sulfated N-acetylhexosamine-containing mono- and disaccharides from patient samples by electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry. Urine from most mucopolysaccharidoses types had significant increases in di- and monosulfated N-acetylhexosamines (GalNAc4,, GalNAc6S, GalNAc4S, or GlcNAc6S) and monosulfated N-acetylhexosamine-uronic acid disaccharides (GalNAc6S-UA, GalNAc4S-UA, or GlcNAc6S-UA). Analysis of plasma and dried blood spots on filter paper collected from mucopolysaccharidoses patients showed elevations of total monosulfated N-acetylhexosamines but less than that seen in urine. Urine samples from bone marrow transplant recipients, mucopolysaccharidosis IVA and mucopolysaccharidosis VI patients, showed decreases in HexNAcS, HexNAcS(2)/GalNAc4,, and HexNAcS-UA post-transplant. This decrease correlated with clinical improvement to levels comparable with those identified in patients with less severe phenotypes. These  markers therefore have potential applications in diagnosis, phenotype prediction and monitoring of current and future therapies, particularly for the mucopolysaccharidosis IIID, IVA, VI, and multiple sulfatase deficiency. This paper reports a sensitive and simple method for the measurement of sulfated N-acetylhexosamines and sulfated disaccharides shown to be elevated in some mucopolysaccharidosis and multiple sulfatase deficient patients.Copyright 2003 Elsevier Science (USA)</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18773746>[Cardiovascular risk and cardiometabolic risk: an epidemiological evaluation].</a></h1><p>On the basis of a critical literature review, this article deals with the concepts of global cardiovascular risk and cardiometabolic risk, pointing out their links but also their unresolved issues and discussing their usefulness in clinical practice. The global cardiovascular risk is the probability of suffering from a coronary event or stroke in a given period of time and in this sense it is an absolute risk, generally reported as percentage at 10 years. Usually risk functions are used, derived from longitudinal studies of healthy people at baseline. They consider some factors that are coherently linked with events in population analyses: among these there are some  factors (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, fasting blood glucose), some biological factors (blood pressure) and some lifestyle factors (tobacco smoking), all modifiable beyond those non-modifiable like age and gender. The chosen factors must be independent at multivariate analysis, simple and standardized to measure, and contribute to significantly increase the risk-function predictivity. To be reliable, these risk functions must be derived from the same population where they will be later administered. For this reason the Italian Progetto CUORE, in the longitudinal study section, built a database of risk factors from longitudinal comparable studies started between the mid '80s and '90s and followed up the participants for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity to estimate the Italian global cardiovascular risk (first coronary or cerebrovascular event) for men and women. Two tools have been produced, the risk charts and a score software (see www.cuore.iss.it). The ongoing epidemics of obesity and diabetes and the fact that diabetes is associated with classical risk factors like hypertension and dyslipidemia induced the American Diabetes Association and the American Heart Association to launch a "call to action" to prevent both cardiovascular disease and diabetes. In this paper, as cardiometabolic risk factors were considered those "closely related to diabetes and cardiovascular disease: fasting/postprandial hyperglycemia, overweight/obesity, elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and dyslipidemia". The association among the cardiometabolic risk factors has been known for a long time, and much of their etiology has been ascribed to insulin resistance. Also, the fact that these "" abnormalities can cluster in many individuals gave rise to the term "", a construct embraced by many organizations but questioned by other authors. From an epidemiological point of view the  seems to increase modestly the cardiovascular risk, whereas in non-diabetic individuals it predicts diabetes much more efficiently. Many studies have compared the performance of the classical cardiovascular evaluation tools (the Framingham risk score, the SCORE charts, the Progetto CUORE score) and  in cardiovascular disease prediction. Usually in people at high risk the presence of the  does not improve the risk, whereas in people at lower risk its presence increases significantly the chances of cardiovascular disease. Many studies have shown that positive lifestyle interventions markedly reduce the rate of progression of type 2 diabetes. Also some drugs were tested for diabetes prevention, usually in people with impaired glucose tolerance. Oral diabetes drugs considered together (acarbose, metformin, flumamine, glipizide, phenformin) were less effective than lifestyle interventions, with different results among the drugs; the antiobesity drug orlistat gave similar results to lifestyle interventions. In Italy an appropriate approach to cardiovascular disease and diabetes prevention may be that of first evaluating the global cardiovascular risk using the charts or the score software of the Progetto CUORE, because high-risk subjects (> or =20%) must be treated aggressively independently of the presence of the ; as a second step the  may be sought, because it increases the risk; finally some attention should be paid to non-diabetic hyperglycemic individuals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28537398>Discovery of Clinical Candidate 2-((2S,)-2-Phenyl-6-hydroxyadamantan-2-yl)-1-(3'-hydroxyazetidin-1-yl)ethanone [BMS-816336], an Orally Active Novel Selective 11β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 Inhibitor.</a></h1><p>BMS-816336 (6n-2), a hydroxy-substituted adamantyl acetamide, has been identified as a novel, potent inhibitor against human 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) enzyme (IC 3.0 nM) with >10000-fold selectivity over human 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2). 6n-2 exhibits a robust acute pharmacodynamic effect in cynomolgus monkeys (ED 0.12 mg/kg) and in DIO mice.

This ADME profile met our selection criteria for once daily administration, targeting robust inhibition of 11β-HSD1 enzyme for the first 12 h period after dosing followed by an "inhibition holiday" so that the potential for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation might be mitigated. 6n-2 was found to be well-tolerated in phase 1 clinical studies and represents a potential new treatment for type 2 diabetes, , and other human diseases modulated by glucocorticoid control.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25554064>Mild training program in  improves the efficiency of the oxygen pathway.</a></h1><p>In sedentary patients suffering of , we evaluated the effects of mild exercise program (EP) on the efficiency of the oxygen delivery system. The prescription of exercise (40 min/session, 3 times/week) was tailored at workload corresponding to ∼90% individual anaerobic threshold (AT). EP improved significantly by ∼10% peak values of oxygen consumption (VO2) and heart rate (HR). Furthermore, in response to steady state workload at 90% AT, EP shortened the time constant of VO2, HR and the ratio VO2/HR (reflecting arterio-venous O2 concentration difference) by ∼. EP also decreased the elastic respiratory work due to a change in breathing pattern implying a larger contribution of respiratory rate, at the expense of tidal volume during exercise hyperventilation. In all subjects the perceived fatigue (Borg) decreased after training. This study supports a positive effect of a mild EP for the adaptive response of the oxygen chain to face  needs compatible with daily life in patients affected by .Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.
