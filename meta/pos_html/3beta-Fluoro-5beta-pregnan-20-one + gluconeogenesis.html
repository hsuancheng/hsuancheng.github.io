<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31152822> in cancer cells - Repurposing of a starvation-induced metabolic pathway?</a></h2><p>Cancer cells constantly face a fluctuating nutrient supply and interference with adaptive responses might be an effective therapeutic approach. It has been discovered that in the absence of glucose, cancer cells can synthesize crucial metabolites by expressing phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK, PCK1 or PCK2) using abbreviated forms of . , which in essence is the reverse pathway of glycolysis, uses lactate or amino acids to feed biosynthetic pathways branching from glycolysis. PCK1 and PCK2 have been shown to be critical for the growth of certain cancers. In contrast, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1), a downstream  enzyme, inhibits glycolysis and tumor growth, partly by non-enzymatic mechanisms. This review sheds light on the current knowledge of cancer cell  and its role in metabolic reprogramming, cancer cell plasticity, and tumor growth.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In recent times, evidences point to the link between thyroid hormones andT2DM in particular. Several lines of evidences suggest an array of biochemical and molecular events. Gene polymorphism, disturbances in gene expression and regulation, enhanced and bizarre absorption of dietary glucose from intestine, decreased utilization of glucose by tissues and aberrations in hepatic handling of glucose with the onus on  are some of the projected mechanisms. Insulin resistance, a progressive condition is the hallmark in T2DM. Hypothyroidism as well as hyperthyroidism have been associated with insulin resistance which are synonymous with impaired glucose metabolism in T2DM. A multitude of basic, clinical and molecular studies provide an insight into thyroid comorbidity in T2DM, though there are a few instances to suggest equivocal link denoting cause-effect relationship. In biochemical pharmacology, as fortified by pharmacogenomics, modalities have now been proposed, through drug trials, to underline the utility of specifically designed thyroid hormone analogues in addressing metabolic syndrome, DM and associated cardiovascular pathology. A thorough understanding of the physiological, biochemical and molecular mechanisms would certainly open newer vistas in the perspectives of T2DM with special reference to alterations in thyroid status.Copyright © 2019 Diabetes India.

This study aimed to investigate the beneficial effect of LR on NAFLD  and  and its underlying molecular mechanism. The effects of LR were examined on the high-fat diet-induced  model in mice and  model of NAFLD in human HepG2 cells. Liver tissues and HepG2 cells were procured for measuring lipid metabolism, histological examination, and western blot analysis. LR administration significantly lowered the serum lipid profile and lipid disposition  and  because of the altered expression of enzymes on hepatic  and lipid metabolism. Moreover, LR significantly decreased Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP1) and then increased the expression of phosphorylated-AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK). However, the overexpression of SHP1 mediated by lentivirus vector reversed LR-induced improvement in lipid deposition. Moreover, SHP1 silencing could further increase the expression of p-AMPK to ameliorate lipid metabolism and relative lipogenic gene induced by LR. In addition, abrogation of AMPK by Compound C eliminated the protective effects of LR on lipid metabolism without changing the expression of SHP1. LR markedly prevented NAFLD through adjusting lipid metabolism via SHP1/AMPK signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31166615>Glucagon up-regulates hepatic mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 through cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; inhibition of hepatic  by ginsenoside Rb1.</a></h2><p>Hepatic mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) transports pyruvate into mitochondria. This study investigated the involvement of MPC1 in hepatic glucagon response, in order to identify a possible pharmacological intervention.The correlation between hepatic glucagon response and MPC1 induction was investigated in fasted mice and primary hepatocytes. The effects of ginsenoside Rb1 on MPC1 function were observed.Glucagon challenge raised blood glucose with hepatic MPC1 induction, and inhibition of MPC induction coincided with a reduced rise in blood glucose. cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) knockdown blocked glucagon-induced MPC1 expression, while CREB overexpression increased MPC1 expression. Luciferase reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and promoter mutation confirmed that CREB increased MPC1 transcription through gene promoter induction. CREB regulated transcription co-activator 2 nuclear translocation was also required for CREB to promote MPC1 induction. Glucagon shifted mitochondrial pyruvate towards carboxylation for  via the opposite regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and carboxylase with respect to MPC1 induction. MPC1 induction was necessary for glucagon to promote pyruvate-driven hepatic glucose production (HGP), but glucagon failed to influence HGP from other gluconeogenic substrates routed into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, independent of MPC. Rb1 blocked cAMP signalling by inhibiting AC activity and deactivated CREB by dephosphorylation, possibly contributing to inhibiting MPC1 induction to reduce HGP.CREB transcriptionally up-regulates MPC1 to provide pyruvate for . Rb1 reduced cAMP formation which consequently reduced CREB-mediated MPC1 induction and thereby might contribute to limiting pyruvate-dependent HGP. These results suggest a therapeutic strategy to reduce hyperglycaemia in diabetes.© 2019 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629173>Environmental risk assessment of triazine herbicides in the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea and their toxicity to phytoplankton at environmental concentrations.</a></h2><p>Herbicides have been increasingly used worldwide and a large amount of herbicide residue eventually enters the ocean via groundwater or surface run-off every year. However, the global coastal pollution status of herbicides and their negative impact on marine life (especially phytoplankton) in natural environmental concentrations are poorly understood except for few special environments (e.g. the Great Barrier Reef, Australia). Our field investigation of the distribution of ten triazine herbicides in the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea of China revealed that the concentrations of triazine herbicides exceeded the "No Observed Effect Concentrations" for phytoplankton. Their total concentrations could be as high as 6.61 nmol L. Based on the concentration addition model, the toxicity of herbicide homologues is usually cumulative, and the combined toxicity of these ten triazine herbicides could cause 13.2% inhibition on the chlorophyll a fluorescence intensity of a representative diatom species Phaeodactylum tricornutum Pt-1, which corresponds roughly to the toxicity of atrazine in an equivalent concentration of 14.08 nmol L. Atrazine in this equivalent-effect concentration could greatly inhibit the growth of cells, the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), and nutrient absorption of Phaeodactylum tricornutum Pt-1. Transcriptome analysis revealed that multiple metabolic pathways (Calvin cycle, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glycolysis/, etc.) related with photosynthesis and carbon metabolism were greatly disturbed, which might ultimately influence the primary productivity of coastal waters. Moreover, with the values of its bioaccumulation factor ranging from 69.6 to 118.9, atrazine was found to be accumulated in algal cells, which indicates that herbicide pollution might eventually affect the marine food web and even threaten the seafood safety of human beings.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, the metabolic explanation for reductions in tissue accretion observed in growing pigs remains poorly defined. Additionally, PRRS virus challenge is often accompanied by reduced feed intake, making it difficult to discern which effects are virus vs. feed intake driven. To account for this, a pair-fed model was employed to examine the effects of PRRS challenge and nutrient restriction on skeletal muscle and liver metabolism. Forty-eight pigs were randomly selected (13.1 ± 1.97 kg BW) and allotted to 1 of 3 treatments (n = 16 pigs/treatment): 1) PRRS naïve, ad libitum fed (Ad), 2) PRRS-inoculated, ad libitum fed (PRRS+), and 3) PRRS naïve, pair-fed to the PRRS-inoculated pigs' daily feed intake (PF). At days postinoculation (dpi) 10 and 17, 8 pigs per treatment were euthanized and tissues collected. Tissues were assayed for markers of proteolysis (LM only), protein synthesis (LM only), oxidative stress (LM only),  (liver), and glycogen concentrations (LM and liver). Growth performance, feed intake, and feed efficiency were all reduced in both PRRS+ and PF pigs compared with Ad pigs (P < 0.001). Furthermore, growth performance and feed efficiency were additionally reduced in PRRS+ pigs compared with PF pigs (P < 0.05). Activity of most markers of LM proteolysis (μ-calpain, 20S proteasome, and caspase 3/7) was not increased (P > 0.10) in PRRS+ pigs compared with Ad pigs, although activity of m-calpain was increased in PRRS+ pigs compared with Ad pigs (P = 0.025) at dpi 17. Muscle reactive oxygen species production was not increased (P > 0.10) in PRRS+ pigs compared with Ad pigs. However, phosphorylation of protein synthesis markers was decreased in PRRS+ pigs compared with both Ad (P < 0.05) and PF (P < 0.05) pigs. Liver  was not increased as a result of PRRS; however, liver glycogen was decreased (P < 0.01) in PRRS+ pigs compared with Ad and PF pigs at both time points. Taken together, this work demonstrates the differential impact a viral challenge and nutrient restriction have on metabolism of growing pigs. Although markers of skeletal muscle proteolysis showed limited evidence of increase, markers of skeletal muscle synthesis were reduced during PRRS viral challenge. Furthermore, liver glycogenolysis seems to provide PRRS+ pigs with glucose needed to fuel the immune response during viral challenge.© The Author(s) 2019.

The current understanding of PEPCK's metabolic role has recently expanded to include it serving as a general mediator of tricarboxylic acid cycle flux. Selective inhibition of PEPCK  and  has been achieved with 3-mercaptopicolinic acid (MPA) ( ∼ 8 μM), whose mechanism of inhibition has been elucidated only recently. On the basis of crystallographic and mechanistic data of various inhibitors of PEPCK, MPA was used as the initial chemical scaffold to create a potentially more selective inhibitor, 3-[(carboxymethyl)thio]picolinic acid (CMP), which has been characterized both structurally and kinetically here. These data demonstrate that CMP acts as a competitive inhibitor at the OAA/PEP binding site, with its picolinic acid moiety coordinating directly with the M1 metal in the active site ( ∼ 29-55 μM). The extended carboxy tail occupies a secondary binding cleft that was previously shown could be occupied by sulfoacetate ( ∼ 82 μM) and for the first time demonstrates the simultaneous occupation of both OAA/PEP subsites by a single molecular structure. By occupying both the OAA/PEP binding subsites simultaneously, CMP and similar molecules can potentially be used as a starting point for the creation of additional selective inhibitors of PEPCK.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31429109>In-depth mapping of the proteome of Tibetan pig tenderloin (longissimus dorsi) using offline high-pH reversed-phase fractionation and LC-MS/MS.</a></h2><p>In recent years, Tibetan pig breeding and meat processing have developed rapidly. However, the basic physiological and biochemical characteristics of Tibetan pork have not been systematically explored. The present study conducted a high-throughput analysis of the tenderloin (longissimus dorsi) proteome of the Tibetan pigs and performed a functional annotation and bioinformatics analysis of the identified proteins. Based on offline two-dimensional liquid chromatography fractionation and MS/MS identification, a total of 1,723 proteins were identified in the tenderloin of Tibetan pigs. Gene ontology analysis and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the proteins involved in respiration (oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis/, citric acid cycle, and pyruvate metabolism) and protein synthesis and metabolism (proteasome, amino acid biosynthesis, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, and ribosomes) were significantly enriched, indicating that the energy production and protein metabolism are the most important physiological processes in Tibetan pig tenderloin. Practical applications The in-depth mapping of the tenderloin (longissimus dorsi) proteome of the Tibetan pigs gives a panoramic perspective at the protein molecular level and provides important information on the mechanisms of postmortem muscle physiology and meat quality formation. Furthermore, the development of Tibetan pork storage and processing technologies would also benefit from the characterization of the biochemical properties of Tibetan pork.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31294837>Evaluation of the effects of different stocking densities on growth and stress responses of juvenile hybrid grouper ♀ Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂ Epinephelus lanceolatus in recirculating aquaculture systems.</a></h2><p>This study was aimed at evaluating the physiological and metabolic responses of juvenile hybrid grouper ♀ Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂ Epinephelus lanceolatus to stocking density. Hybrid grouper juveniles (mean ± SE = 25.43 ± 2.36 g live mass) were stocked for 22 weeks in a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) under four different densities: low stocking density (LD; 1.03 kg m ), medium stocking density (MD; 2.06 kg m ), high stocking density (HD; 3.09 kg m ) and extra-high stocking density (EHD; 4.11 kg m ). Biometric variables were recorded and plasma, liver, intestine and stomach samples were taken for biochemical analysis at the end of the experimental period. Final stocking densities were 6.27, 16.04, 23.77 and 28.32 kg m , respectively, with significant differences in growth performance. Our results showed that the best growth rates and feed utilisation occurred in the MD group. Higher plasma cortisol and glucose levels and lower triglyceride levels reflected the stress responses in the EHD group. Moreover, the activity of aspartate and alanine transaminases was elevated in the HD and EHD groups due to enhanced . The activity of the digestive enzyme pepsin significantly increased in the MD group. We found that 2.06-3.09 kg m is the most suitable starting density for culturing juvenile hybrid grouper in recirculating aquaculture systems.© 2019 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554135>Hepatic transcriptome and proteome analyses provide new insights into the regulator mechanism of dietary avicularin in diabetic mice.</a></h2><p>Many dietary flavonoids existing as glycosides in fruits and vegetables are considered bioactive food components with various potential health benefits. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex and polygenic disease with increasing global prevalence and economic burden. In this study, the hypoglycemic effect of avicularin (quercetin-3-O-α-arabinofuranoside), a flavonoid glycoside commonly found in natural plants and fruits, was determined in a high fat diet/streptozotocin induced type 2 diabetes mouse model. Our results demonstrated that dietary avicularin treatment reduced levels of fasting blood glucose, serum TG and LDL-C, liver AST and ALT, and increased hepatic glycogen in T2DM mice. Furthermore, we used RNA-Seq and iTRAQ to compare the gene and protein expression in the livers of the normal control mice (NC), diabetic control mice (DC) and avicularin treated mice (DA100). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were analyzed based on gene annotations and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. Integrated analysis of the RNA-Seq and iTRAQ data indicated that the fifteen DEGs/DEPs showed the same trend in mRNA and protein expression levels in comparisons of both NC vs DC and DC vs DA100. KEGG analysis revealed that four DEGs/DEPs (PKM, PEPCK, PYG, and PLA2) in the glycolysis, , and arachidonic acid pathway, and six DEPs (Ndufb4, Ndufa6, Cox5a, Cox5b, Cox6c, and ATPSβ) in the oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway, play important roles in avicularin's hypoglycemic effect. We also found six other DEGs/DEPs related to T2DM (CA1, Serpinb6a, AK, Pcolce, Cand2, and Atp2a3), and five related to cancer (Phgdh, Tes, Papss1, Psat1, and Fam49b). We did further verify by qRT-PCR and explored the possible binding modes of avicularin with targeted proteins with molecular docking simulations. Taken together, our results demonstrated the protective effects of avicularin against diabetes and provided a global view about the system-level hypoglycemic mechanisms of avicularin by the comprehensive analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data in T2DM mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The decreased protein expression involved in the PI3K-Akt pathway may enhance hepatic glycogenolysis and . Obesity-associated glucose dysregulation and IR are risk factors for the development of peripheral arterial disease. Glutamine (Gln) has immunomodulatory properties and was found to attenuate IR and hyperglycemia in diabetic condition. Thus, in this study we hypothesized that Gln administration modulates hepatic glucose metabolism and improve IR via PI3K-Akt pathway in obese mice with limb ischemia. Mice were divided into a high-fat group (HC), and a high-fat Gln group (HG). Mice in the HC group were fed the high-fat diet for 8 weeks, while the HG group was initially fed the high-fat diet for 4 weeks followed by a high-fat diet with Gln for an additional 4 weeks. Part of the mice in the HC and HG groups were subjected to a limb ischemic operation and were euthanized after the operation. Liver tissues and blood samples were collected for analysis. The results showed that high-fat diet-induced obesity resulted in increased plasma glucose and insulin levels. Also, impairment of hepatic insulin signaling by downregulating PI3K-Akt pathway-associated protein expression was observed. Administration of Gln increased protein expression associated with PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, while reducing G6PC and FOXO1 expression in the hepatocytes that may promote glycogen synthesis and inhibit . These findings suggest that obese mice treated with Gln-containing high-fat diet may normalize blood glucose and improve IR in response to limb ischemia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The regulatory factors that are involved in fasting glucagon response are not well understood. Here we report a role of p52, a key activator of the noncanonical nuclear factor-kappaB signaling, in hepatic glucagon response. We show that p52 is activated in livers of HFD-fed and glucagon-challenged mice. Knockdown of p52 lowers glucagon-stimulated hyperglycemia, while p52 overexpression augments glucagon response. Mechanistically, p52 binds to phosphodiesterase 4B promoter to inhibit its transcription and promotes cAMP accumulation, thus augmenting the glucagon response through cAMP/PKA signaling. The anti-diabetic drug metformin and ginsenoside Rb1 lower blood glucose at least in part by inhibiting p52 activation.

This study examined the impact of combined gestational and lactational exposure to the fungicide tolylfluanid (TF) on metabolic physiology in adult offspring. C57BL/6 J dams received standard rodent chow or the same diet containing 67 mg/kg TF. Offspring growth and metabolism were assessed up to 22 weeks of age. TF-exposed offspring exhibited reduced weaning weight. Body weight among female offspring remained low throughout the study, while male offspring matched controls by 17 weeks of age. Female offspring exhibited reduced glucose tolerance, markedly enhanced systemic insulin sensitivity, reduced adiposity, and normal gluconeogenic capacity during adulthood. In contrast, male offspring exhibited impaired glucose tolerance with unchanged insulin sensitivity, no differences in adiposity, and increased gluconeogenic capacity. These data indicate that developmental exposure to TF induces sex-specific metabolic disruptions that recapitulate key aspects of other in utero growth restriction models.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To identify candidate  resistance proteins and explore the molecular mechanisms involved in poplar-pathogen interactions, proteomic responses of stem samples from resistant and susceptible poplar ecotypes to  were investigated using nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with label-free quantitative analysis. We identified 588 proteins, divided into 21 biological process categories including 48 oxidoreductases, 72 hydrolytic enzymes, 80 metabolic enzymes, and 29 proteins of unknown function. Differential proteome analysis revealed large differences between resistant P. tomentosa and susceptible  Hsu ecotypes before and after inoculation. Among 102 identified proteins, 22 were highly up-regulated in the resistant genotype but down-regulated in the susceptible genotype. Proteins induced in P. tomentosa in response to B. dothidea are associated with plant defenses including oxidoreductase activity (catalase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase), phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and phenylalanine metabolism (alcohol dehydrogenase), photosynthesis (ATP synthase subunit alpha, ATP synthase gamma chain, photosystem I P700 chlorophyll a apoprotein A2, photosystem II CP47 chlorophyll apoprotein), carbon fixation (pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, malic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain), and glycolysis/ (fructose-bisphosphate aldolase). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis identified 168 proteins related to metabolic pathways, 41 proteins related to the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids, and 36 proteins related to the biosynthesis of plant hormones, the biosynthesis of alkaloids derived from ornithine, lysine, and nicotinic acid, and photosynthesis in response to .

In a previous study, we showed that Sir2 is regulated by S-glutathionylation of key cysteine residues located at the catalytic domain. Mutation of these residues results in strains with increased resistance to disulfide stress. In the present study, these mutant cells were highly resistant to acetic acid and had an increased chronological life span. Mutant cells had increased acetyl-CoA synthetase activity, which converts acetic acid generated by yeast metabolism to acetyl.CoA. This could explain the acetic acid resistance and lower levels of this toxic acid in the extracellular media during aging. Increased acetyl-CoA levels would raise lipid droplets, a source of energy during aging, and fuel glyoxylate-dependent . The key enzyme of this pathway, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1), showed increased activity in these Sir2 mutant cells during aging. Sir2 activity decreased when cells shifted to the diauxic phase in the mutant strains, compared to the WT strain. Since Pck1 is inactivated through Sir2-dependent deacetylation, the decline in Sir2 activity explained the rise in Pck1 activity. As a consequence, storage of sugars such as trehalose would increase. We conclude that extended longevity observed in the mutants was a combination of increased lipid droplets and trehalose, and decreased acetic acid in the extracellular media. These results offer a deeper understanding of the redox regulation of Sir2 in acetic acid resistance, which is relevant in some food and industrial biotechnology and also in the metabolism associated to calorie restriction, aging and pathologies such as diabetes.Copyright © 2019.

The distinct physiological roles of FBAs in various organisms have been reported; however, in cyanobacteria, the functional characterization of FBAs and investigation of the intracellular dynamics of FBAs largely remains unknown. Here, we utilized a two-step chromatographic technique to identify a class I FBA (CI-FBA), which we named H2846. H2846 was induced by salt stress in the halotolerant cyanobacterium Halothece sp. PCC 7418 (hereafter referred to as Halothece 7418). Phylogenetic analysis showed that H2846-like CI-FBAs existed mainly in cyanobacterial species that inhabit hypersaline environments. Subcellular fractionation revealed that H2846 localized in the cytosolic and periplasmic spaces and size-exclusion chromatography suggested that H2846 formed a homohexamer. The CI-FBA activity of recombinant H2846-mediated cleavage of fructose bisphosphate (FBP) was characterized using a coupled enzymatic assay. This analysis allowed us to determine the K and V values of recombinant H2846, which were then compared to previously reported K and V values of several FBAs. Our data suggested that H2846 was likely responsible for the salt stress-induced CI-FBA activity from the total soluble protein extracts derived from Halothece 7418 cells. Moreover, heterologous expression of H2846 but not H2847, a class II FBA (CII-FBA), conferred salt stress tolerance to the salt-sensitive freshwater cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, which only contains the CII-FBA, S1443. S. elongatus PCC 7942 with a S1443 gene deletion was complemented by H2847 expression, but was not complemented by expression of H2846. Taken together, these results indicate the functional differences between two distinct sets of FBAs in cyanobacteria. H2846 is an active CI-FBA that contributes to the mechanism of salt stress tolerance in Halothece 7418.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we provide a comprehensive proteomic characterization of periodontal ligament cells under hypoxic conditions, aiming to reveal previously unappreciated biological changes and to help advance hypoxia-based therapeutic strategies for periodontal diseases.Human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) were characterized using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and flow cytometry (FACS). Successful hypoxia treatment of hPDLCs with 1% O was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Proliferation was evaluated using an MTT assay. The proteomic expression profile under hypoxia was studied with the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) approach followed by protein identification and bioinformatic analysis, and western blot verification was performed.The hPDLCs were positive for vimentin, CD73 and CD105 and negative for keratin, CD34 and CD45. After hypoxia treatment, the mRNA expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1a ( was upregulated. The proliferation rate was elevated during the first 6 h but decreased from 6 h to 72 h. A total of 220 differentially expressed proteins were quantified in hPDLCs under hypoxia (1% O, 24 h), including 153 upregulated and 67 downregulated proteins, five of which were verified by western blot analysis. The Gene Ontology enriched terms included the energy metabolic process, membrane-bound organelle and vesicle, and protein binding terms. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated several involved pathways, including glycolysis/, biosynthesis of amino acids, the HIF-1 signalling pathway, and focal adhesion. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network demonstrated the dominant role of autophagy over apoptosis under hypoxia.The proteomic profile of hPDLCs under hypoxia was mainly related to energy metabolism, autophagy, and responses to stimuli such as adhesion and inflammation. Previously unrecognized proteins including solute carrier family proteins, heat shock proteins, ubiquitination-related enzymes, collagen and S100 family proteins are involved in adaptive response to hypoxia in hPDLCs and are thus of great research interest in future work.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31473204>Pancreastatin inhibitor, PSTi8 ameliorates metabolic health by modulating AKT/GSK-3β and PKCλ/ζ/SREBP1c pathways in high fat diet induced insulin resistance in peri-/post-menopausal rats.</a></h2><p>Increase in the prevalence of insulin resistance (IR) in peri-/post-menopause women is mainly due to hormone deficiency and lifestyle.

We identified 5932 high-confidence proteins; 1494 were differentially abundant between the two samples, including 749 up- and 745 down-regulated proteins. The up- and down-regulated proteins that could be essential for anther development and male sterility in sterile buds were mainly involved in (1) carbohydrate and energy metabolism (pyruvate dehydrogenase, glycolysis/, TCA cycle, starch and sucrose metabolism), (2) pollen wall synthesis and regulation (pectinesterase, polygalacturonase, pectate lyase, beta-galactosidase, glycosyl hydrolase), (3) protein synthesis and degradation (proteasome subunits, ribosome proteins, ABC transporters, RNA transport, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum), (4) flavonoid biosynthesis, and (5) plant hormone signal transduction. We identified 10 genes/proteins that were both up-regulated and 122 that were both down-regulated in a conjoint analysis. Multiple reaction monitoring and qRT-PCR validation showed that the iTRAQ results were accurate and reliable. These findings will provide valuable information on proteins involved in anther development, and will contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) that underlie male sterility in Chinese cabbage. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Chinese cabbage is an allogamous plant with bisexual flowers that displays significant heterosis. The application of male sterile lines is a very efficient way to produce hybrid seeds, which can generate stronger plants that develop more rapidly and produce higher yield. However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying multiple-allele-inherited male sterility in Chinese cabbage is unknown. In this study, we used a quantitative proteomic approach (iTRAQ) to identify DAPs between fertile and sterile buds of the GMS line 'AB01'. Subsequently, we also performed conjoined analysis of the iTRAQ results and our previously reported transcriptomics results. The aim of this research was to obtain the key DAPs and to identify the significantly enriched pathways involved in anther development and male sterility. These results may provide new insights into the molecular mechanism(s) underlying multiple-allele-inherited male sterility in Chinese cabbage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to investigate the role of the SHH gene and its encoded protein, sonic hedgehog (SHH), in two human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. MATERIAL AND METHODS The human HCC cell lines Hep3B and SMMC-7721 were cultured. Cells were transfected with plasmids carrying specific SHH gene short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) and negative control (NC) shRNA. The effects of knockdown of expression levels of the SHH gene were studied on cell survival, cell apoptosis, the cell cycle, , and the expression of PCK1. Anchorage-independent growth, a characteristic of transformed cells, was detected by the colony formation assay. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot were performed 24 h after transfection. RESULTS Knockdown of expression levels of the SHH gene reduced cell proliferation and growth of HCC cells and induced cell apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest in both HCC cell lines. Knockdown of the SHH gene decreased the levels of glycolysis products and increased the production of glucose and reduced the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt but induced the expression of PCK1. CONCLUSIONS Knockdown of the SHH gene reduced cell survival of HCC cells by increasing apoptosis, reducing cell proliferation, inducing G1 cell cycle arrest, and restoring , and was associated with the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt axis and induced the expression of PCK1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314991>Gadofullerene Nanoparticles Reverse Dysfunctions of Pancreas and Improve Hepatic Insulin Resistance for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Treatment.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been one of the most prevalent metabolic disorders. Nonetheless, the commonly used anti-T2DM drugs failed to substant to treat T2DM when anti-T2DM was withdrawn. Here we put forward a superior and sustainable anti-diabetic strategy using intraperitoneal administration of amino-acid-functionalized gadofullerene nanoparticles (GFNPs) in db/db diabetic mice. Highly accumulated in the pancreas and liver, GFNPs could prominently decrease hyperglycemia, along with permanently maintaining normal blood sugar levels in T2DM mice and even stopping administration. Importantly, GFNPs reversed the pancreas islets dysfunctions by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation responses and fundamentally normalized the insulin secretory function of the pancreas islets. Mechanistically, GFNPs improved hepatic insulin resistance by regulating glucose and lipid metabolism through the activation of IRS2/PI3K/AKT signal pathways, resulting in inhibiting  and increasing glycogenesis in the liver. Additionally, GFNPs relieved hepatic steatosis in the liver, ultimately maintaining systemic glucose and lipid metabolic homeostasis without obvious toxicity. Together, GFNPs reverse the dysfunctions of the pancreas and improve hepatic insulin resistance, providing a promising approach for T2DM treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141525>Glucose metabolism is differentially altered by choline and methionine in bovine neonatal hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Choline and methionine serve essential roles in the liver that may interact with glucose metabolism. Our objectives were to quantify glucose export, cellular glycogen, and expression of genes controlling oxidation and  in primary bovine neonatal hepatocytes exposed to increasing concentrations of choline chloride (CC) and D,L-methionine (DLM) with or without fatty acids (FA). Primary hepatocytes isolated from 3 Holstein calves were maintained as monolayer cultures for 24 h before treatment with CC (61, 128, 2028, 4528 μmol/L) and DLM (16, 30, 100, 300 μmol/L) with or without a 1 mmol/L FA cocktail in a factorial design. After 24 h, media was harvested to quantify glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and cells harvested to quantify glycogen, DNA, and gene expression. No interactions between CC and DLM were detected. The potential two-way interaction between CC or DLM and FA was partitioned into three contrasts when P ≤ 0.20: linear without FA, linear with FA, difference of slope. Fatty acids did not affect glucose or cellular glycogen but increased pyruvate carboxylase (PC), cytosolic and mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCKc, PEPCKm), and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) expression. Increasing CC decreased glucose but increased cellular glycogen. Expression of PC and PEPCKc was increased by CC during FA treatment. Increasing DLM did not affect metabolites or PC expression, although PEPCKc was marginally decreased. Methionine did not affect G6PC, while CC had a marginal quadratic effect on G6PC. Oxidative and gluconeogenic enzymes appear to respond to FA in primary bovine neonatal hepatocytes. Increased PC and PEPCKc by CC during FA treatment suggest increased gluconeogenic capacity. Changes in G6PC may have shifted glucose-6-phosphate towards cellular glycogen; however, subsequent examination of G6PC protein is needed. Unaltered PC and marginally decreased PEPCKc suggest increased oxidative capacity with DLM, although BHB export was unaltered. The differential regulation supports unique effects of CC and DLM within bovine hepatocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351995>Hepatic deficiency of Poldip2 in type 2 diabetes dampens lipid and glucose homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Moderate or low level hydrogen peroxides has been shown to play an important role in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) function, in which the polymerase DNA-directed interacting protein 2 (Poldip2), functioned as a key regulator of NOX4 activity. In current study, we unexpectedly found that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) substantially suppresses the hepatic Poldip2 expression, and that the hepatic deficiency of Poldip2 may be correlated with dysregulation of hepatic cholesterol and plasma triglycerides. In cultured hepatocytes, we found that both insulin and leptin may inhibit hepatic expression of Poldip2 under high glucose concentration, but these suppressions were totally abolished under normoglycemic condition. POLDIP2 siRNA knockdown significantly impaired the HO induction by insulin or leptin under normoglycemic condition, contributing the accumulation of cholesterol in cultured liver cells. The in vivo restoration of hepatic Poldip2 expression in T2DM mice remarkably rescued the moderate HO generation in livers versus control mice, resulting in significant amelioration of hepatic cholesterol accumulation and plasma triglyceride levels. Importantly, the moderate induction of HO in livers dramatically improved the hepatic PI3K-C/AKT signaling or dampened PI3K-Cγ/AKT signaling through suppression of PTEN and PTP1B activities, thereby inhibiting the hepatic expression of HMGCR and SREBP2 for cholesterol synthesis. Moreover, the restitution of hepatic Poldip2 expression in diabetic mice significantly lowered the VLDL-cholesterol production rate, and substantially suppressed PEPCK and G6Pase expressions for , thus significantly improving the plasma insulin and glucose levels, and ITT and GTT outcomes in diabetic mice. Our findings suggest that hepatic dysregulation of Poldip2 may contribute to diabetic dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The rats in the normal control group were given sterilized water for free drinking. The rats in the DEN administration group were given 0.1 mg/mL DEN solution for free drinking. After 18 weeks, the kidney tissues were collected and tested for nuclear magnetic resonance detection and pathological examination.  Results: The content of kidneys metabolites in the rats with the DEN administration was changed significantly. The levels of alanine, taurine, pyruvate, acetate, and choline were significantly reduced compared with rat in the normal control group, while the levels of creatine, glycine, TMAO, methionine, proline, lactate, valine, leucine and isoleucine were significantly increased.  Conclusion: Metabolicomics studies have revealed significant differences in five metabolic pathways, including valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, glycine serine and threonine metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis or , cysteine and methionine metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406506>Targeting CYP4A attenuates hepatic steatosis in a novel multicellular organotypic liver model.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) begins as simple hepatic steatosis, but further progress to chronic liver diseases results in severe liver damage and hepatic failure. However, therapeutic options are scarce due to the lack of reliable human in vitro liver models for understanding disease progression mechanisms and developing therapies.We describe here a novel method for generating 3D hepatic spheroids using HepaRG cells, vascular endothelial cells, and mesenchymal stem cells cultured on a thick layer of soft matrix in a narrow conical tube; this method improved self-organization efficiency and functional competence. We further developed a 3D hepatic steatosis model with excess glucose and palmitate, accurately recapitulating steatosis phenotypes such as neutral lipid accumulation, enhanced expression of lipogenesis and  markers, increased intracellular triglyceride content, and reduced glucose uptake. The expression and activity of cytochrome P450 4A (CYP4A), a hepatic glucose and lipid homeostasis enzyme, that is highly expressed in liver tissues from NAFLD patients, was induced in our in vitro steatosis model, and inhibiting CYP4A with the selective inhibitor HET0016 or a specific siRNA ameliorated steatosis-related pathology through reduced ER stress and improved insulin signaling.We provide here a novel 3D human cell-based hepatic model that can be easily generated and reliably simulate hepatic steatosis pathology. We have experimentally validated its potential for target validation and drug evaluation by focusing on CYP4A, which may serve as a translational platform for drug development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31230984>OLFR734 Mediates Glucose Metabolism as a Receptor of Asprosin.</a></h2><p>Asprosin is a fasting-induced hormone that promotes glucose production in the liver and stimulates appetite in the hypothalamus by activating the cAMP signaling pathway via an unknown G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). However, the bona fide receptor of Asprosin is unclear. Here, we have identified that the olfactory receptor OLFR734 acts as a receptor of Asprosin to modulate hepatic glucose production. Olfr734 knockout mice show a blunted response to Asprosin, including attenuated cAMP levels and hepatic glucose production, and improved insulin sensitivity. As Olfr734 deficiency dramatically attenuates both fasting and high-fat-diet-induced glucose production, our results demonstrate a critical role of OLFR734 as a receptor of Asprosin to maintain glucose homeostasis during fasting and in obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Blood analyte measurements were used for correlation and mediation analysis to investigate how age, BMI, and fat percentage affect the relation between DLK1 and GDR. Confirmatory animal studies performed in normal (NC) and high fat diet (HFD) fed Dlk1 and Dlk1 mice included DXA scanning, glucose tolerance tests (GTTs), blood measurements, and skeletal muscle glucose uptake studies by positron emission tomography (PET), histology, qRT-PCR, and in vitro cell studies.Overall, DLK1 is positively correlated with fat amounts, which is consistent with a negative linear relationship between DLK1 and GDR. This relationship is not mediated by age, BMI, or fat percentage. In support, DLK1 also correlates positively with HOMA-IR and ADIPO-IR in these humans, but has no linear relationship with the early diabetic inflammation marker MCP-1. In Dlk1 mice, the increase in fat percentage and adipocyte size induced by HFD is attenuated, and these animals are protected against insulin resistance. These Dlk1 effects seem independent of , but at least partly relies on increased in vivo glucose uptake in skeletal muscles by Dlk1 regulating the major glucose transporter Glut4 in vivo as well as in two independent cell lines.Thus, instead of an adipogenic inhibitor, Dlk1 should be regarded as a factor causally linked to obesity and insulin resistance, and may be used to predict development of type 2 diabetes.

The urine of patients with SDHx-associated tumors presented substantially higher levels of three metabolites compared with the urine of patients without mutation; the metabolite set enrichment analysis identified , pyruvate, and aspartate metabolism as the pathways that most probably explained the differences found. N-acetylaspartate was the only metabolite the urinary levels of which were significantly different between the three groups.The metabolomic urine profile of the SDHx mutation carriers with tumors is different from that of asymptomatic carriers and from that of patients with sporadic neoplasms. Differences are likely to reflect the altered mitochondria energy production and pseudohypoxia signature of these tumors. The urinary levels of N-acetylaspartate and succinate contrast with those reported in tumor tissue, suggesting a defective washout process of oncometabolites in association with tumorigenesis. The role of N-acetylaspartate as a tumor marker for these tumors merits further investigation.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31449567>Comparative multi-omics systems analysis reveal the glycolysis /  signal pathway play an important role in virulence attenuation in fish-derived GBS YM001.</a></h2><p>Streptococcus agalactiae(GBS) is a seriously threat to the farmed tilapia, and oral vaccination was considered to be the most desirable means which requires deep understanding of virulence mechanism of the fish-derived GBS. Our previous genome study of the fish-derived attenuated strain YM001 showed that there were two large deletions in YM001 compared to its parental virulent strain HN016. In this study, a combined transcriptomic and proteomic analysis was performed on YM001 and HN016 strains, and the important genes were verified by RT-qPCR in bacteria strains and infected-tilapia tissues. Overall, we have shown that a total of 958 genes and 331 proteins were significantly differential expressed between YM001 and HN016. By functional annotation of these DEGs and DEPs, genes that were enriched in pentose phosphate pathway(pgm, ptsG, pgi pfkA, fbaA and FBP3) and pyruvate metabolism pathway(pdhA, pdhB, pdhC and pdhD) were identifed as important candidate genes for leads low growth ability in attenuated strain, which may be an important reasons leading virulence attenuation in the end.

Therefore, we sought to explore how actin, myosin, sarcoplasmic protein, mitochondrial, and glycogen concentrations were altered in individuals that exhibited mean skeletal muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA) hypertrophy following 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training. Thirty previously resistance-trained, college-aged males (mean ± standard deviation: 21±2 years, 5±3 training years) had vastus lateralis (VL) muscle biopsies obtained prior to training (PRE), at week 3 (W3), and at week 6 (W6). Muscle tissue from 15 subjects exhibiting PRE to W6 VL mean fCSA increases ranging from 320-1600 μm2 was further interrogated using various biochemical and histological assays as well as proteomic analysis. Seven of these individuals donated a VL biopsy after refraining from training 8 days following the last training session (W7) to determine how deloading affected biomarkers. The 15 fCSA hypertrophic responders experienced a +23% increase in mean fCSA from PRE to W6 (p<0.001) and, while muscle glycogen concentrations remained unaltered, citrate synthase activity levels decreased by 24% (p<0.001) suggesting mitochondrial volume decreased. Interestingly, repeated measures ANOVAs indicated that p-values approached statistical significance for both myosin and actin (p = 0.052 and p = 0.055, respectively), and forced post hoc tests indicated concentrations for both proteins decreased ~30% from PRE to W6 (p<0.05 for each target). Phalloidin-actin staining similarly revealed actin concentrations per fiber decreased from PRE to W6. Proteomic analysis of the sarcoplasmic fraction from PRE to W6 indicated 40 proteins were up-regulated (p<0.05), KEGG analysis indicated that the glycolysis/ pathway was upregulated (FDR sig. <0.001), and DAVID indicated that the following functionally-annotated pathways were upregulated (FDR value <0.05): a) glycolysis (8 proteins), b) acetylation (23 proteins), c)  (5 proteins) and d) cytoplasm (20 proteins). At W7, sarcoplasmic protein concentrations remained higher than PRE (+66%, p<0.05), and both actin and myosin concentrations remained lower than PRE (~-50%, p<0.05). These data suggest that short-term high-volume resistance training may: a) reduce muscle fiber actin and myosin protein concentrations in spite of increasing fCSA, and b) promote sarcoplasmic expansion coincident with a coordinated up-regulation of sarcoplasmic proteins involved in glycolysis and other metabolic processes related to ATP generation. Interestingly, these effects seem to persist up to 8 days following training.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666474>The Effects of BCAAs on Insulin Resistance in Athletes.</a></h2><p>The toxic catabolic intermediates of branched chain amino acids can cause insulin resistance, and are involved in different mechanisms in different metabolic tissues. In skeletal muscle, 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate produced by valine promotes skeletal muscle fatty acid uptake, resulting in the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipids in skeletal muscle, causing skeletal muscle insulin resistance. In the liver, branched-chain α-keto acids decompose in large amounts, promote hepatic , and lead to the accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines, which damages the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, resulting in the accumulation of incomplete oxidation products, oxidative stress in mitochondria, and hepatic insulin resistance. In adipose tissue, the expression of branched-chain amino acid catabolic enzymes (branched-chain amino acid transaminase, branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase) is reduced, resulting in an increased level of plasma branched-chain amino acids, thereby causing massive decomposition of branched-chain amino acids in tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver, and inducing insulin resistance. However, branched-chain amino acids, as a common nutritional supplement for athletes, do not induce insulin resistance. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that exercise can enhance the mitochondrial oxidative potential of branched-chain amino acids, alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation of branched-chain amino acid catabolic intermediates, and promotes branched-chain amino acids catabolism into beta-aminoisobutyric acid, increasing plasma beta-aminoisobutyric acid concentration, improving insulin resistance. This article reveals the mechanism of BCAA-induced insulin resistance and the relationship between exercise and BCAAs metabolism, adds a guarantee for the use of BCAAs, and provides a new explanation for the occurrence of diabetes and how exercise improves diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497353>USP44 suppresses pancreatic cancer progression and overcomes gemcitabine resistance by deubiquitinating FBP1.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is considered to be the deadliest cancer type in the world. Chemotherapy resistance, including gemcitabine, is the main reason for poor prognosis in PDAC patients. Increased aerobic glycolysis is involved in chemotherapy resistance in PDAC. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) is one of the key enzymes in the process of  and negatively regulates aerobic glycolysis. FBP1 loss is common in PDAC patient specimens and is associated with gemcitabine resistance by activating the MAPK pathway.

Here, we found that ubiquitin-specific protease 44 (USP44) was down-regulated in PDAC patients, and USP44 might be a prognostic marker for PDAC patients. USP44 inhibit tumor cells progression and regulated gemcitabine resistance in PDAC. Importantly, we revealed USP44 promoted FBP1 deubiquitination to increase FBP1 protein expression in pancreatic cancer, which might be one of the underlying mechanisms of USP44 impeding the progression of pancreatic cancer.

To understand the main genetic effects of these traits and the genetic networks underlying their correlation, we have conducted the whole genome resequencing with 427 oysters collected from the world-wide scale.After association analysis, 168 clustered significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci were identified for glycogen content and 17 SNPs were verified with 288 oyster individuals in another wide populations. These were the most important candidate loci for oyster breeding. Among 24 genes in the 100-kb regions of the leading SNP loci, cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1) contained a non-synonymous SNP and displayed higher expressions in high glycogen content individuals. This might enhance the  process by the transcriptionally regulating the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase). Also, for amino acids content, 417 clustered significant SNPs were identified. After genetic network analysis, three node SNP regions were identified to be associated with glycogen, protein, and Asp content, which might explain their significant correlation.Overall, this study provides insights into the genetic correlation among complex traits, which will facilitate future oyster functional studies and breeding through molecular design.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199413>Synergistic effect of sea cucumber saponins and EPA-enriched phospholipids on insulin resistance in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>Sea cucumber saponins (SCS) exhibit a significant effect on ameliorating glucose and lipid disorders by inhibiting fatty acid biosynthesis; however, high cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity limit their application. Eicosapentaenoic acid-enriched phospholipids (EPA-PL) significantly ameliorate insulin resistance and elevate the level of hepatic lipolysis, which may have a synergistic effect with SCS in alleviating obesity-related insulin resistance via multiple mechanisms. In the present study, high-fat diet-induced male C57BL/6J mice with obesity-related insulin resistance were used to evaluate the synergistic effect of SCS and EPA-PL on alleviating the insulin resistance. Results show that the combination of SCS and EPA-PL at a half dose exhibited a significant improvement on glucose intolerance and systematic insulin sensitivity than SCS or EPA-PL alone. Moreover, the half dose-combination remarkably inhibited the macrophage infiltration (F4/80) to white adipose tissue (WAT) and significantly down-regulated the level of MCP1, TNF-α and IL-6 compared with SCS and EPA-PL alone. Consequently, the combined administration not only decreased hepatic  and increased hepatic glycogen synthesis (P < 0.05), but also stimulated the glucose uptake in WAT and muscle (P < 0.05). Nevertheless, neither SCS or EPA-PL alone exhibited any effect on the glucose uptake. The combination of SCS and EPA-PL contributed to a synergistic effect on alleviating the obesity-related insulin resistance due to the amelioration of an inflammation-centric peripheral insulin response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31460269>Rubrofusarin as a Dual Protein Tyrosine Phosphate 1B and Human Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitor: An in Vitro and in Silico Study.</a></h2><p>A number of nature-derived biologically active compounds comprise glycosides. In some cases, the glycosidic residue is needed for bioactivity; however, in other cases, glycosylation just improves some pharmacokinetic/dynamic parameters. The patterns of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and human monoamine oxidase A (hMAO-A) inhibition by rubrofusarin 6--β-d-glucopyranoside (), rubrofusarin 6--β-d-gentiobioside (), rubrofusarin triglucoside (), and cassiaside B2 () were compared with the aglycone, rubrofusarin, isolated from  seeds. Rubrofusarin showed potent inhibition against the PTP1B enzyme (IC; 16.95 ± 0.49 μM), and its glycosides reduced activity (IC; 87.36 ± 1.08 μM for  and >100 μM for -) than did the reference drug, ursolic acid (IC; 2.29 ± 0.04 μM). Similarly, in hMAO-A inhibition, rubrofusarin displayed the most potent activity with an IC value of 5.90 ± 0.99 μM, which was twice better than the reference drug, deprenyl HCl (IC; 10.23 ± 0.82 μM). An enzyme kinetic and molecular docking study revealed rubrofusarin to be a mixed-competitive inhibitor of both these enzymes. In a western blot analysis, rubrofusarin increased glucose uptake significantly and decreased the PTP1B expression in a dose-dependent manner in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, increased the expression of phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt) and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (p-IRS1) (Tyr 895), and decreased the expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), key enzymes of . Our overall results show that glycosylation retards activity; however, it reduces toxicity.

Thus, alterations of protein expression are typically associated with cell-cell signal transduction and regulation of cellular functions.Co-culture models of bone marrow stromal cells and hematopoietic cells are often used in studies of their crosstalk. Studies of altered protein expression initiated by stromal cell/hematopoietic cell interactions are an important new trend in microenvironmental research. There has been no report to date of global quantitative proteomics analysis of crosstalk between hematopoietic cells and stromal cells. In this study, we analyzed quantitative proteomes in a co-culture system of stromal HS5 cells and hematopoietic KG1a cells, and simultaneously tracked differentially expressed proteins in two types of cells before and after co-culture by stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) method.We have shown that in co-cultured KG1a, 40 proteins (including CKAP4, LMNA, and SERPINB2) were upregulated and 64 proteins (including CD44, CD99, and NCAM1) were downregulated relative to KG1a alone. We utilized IPA analysis to discover that the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway was upregulated, whereas platelet activation was downregulated in co-cultured KG1a cells. Furthermore, 95 proteins (including LCP1, ARHGAP4, and UNCX) were upregulated and 209 proteins (including CAPG, FLNC, and MAP4) were downregulated in co-cultured HS5 relative to HS5 alone. The tight junction pathway was downregulated and glycolysis/ pathway was dysfunctional in co-cultured HS5. Most importantly, the significantly differentially expressed proteins can also be confirmed using different co-cultured cell lines.Altogether, we recommend such quantitative proteomics approach for the studies of the hematopoietic-stroma cross-talk, differentially expressed proteins and related signaling pathways identification. The differentially expressed proteins identified from this current SILAC method will provide a useful basis for ongoing studies of crosstalk between stromal cells and hematopoietic cells in co-culture systems. All these result suggested our ongoing studies can focus on the mechanisms underlying CKAP4 increase and CD44 decrease in co-cultured hematopoietic cells, and the increase of LCP1 and decrease of CAPG in co-cultured stromal cell.

We identified the expression of a G protein-coupled receptor, Gpr17, in the ARH and hypothesized that it contributes to the regulatory function of POMC neurons on metabolism.In order to test this hypothesis, we generated POMC neuron-specific Gpr17 knockout (PGKO) mice and determined their energy and glucose metabolic phenotypes on normal chow diet (NCD) and high-fat diet (HFD).Adult PGKO mice on NCD displayed comparable body composition and metabolic features measured by indirect calorimetry. By contrast, PGKO mice on HFD demonstrated a sexually dimorphic phenotype with female PGKO mice displaying better metabolic homeostasis. Notably, female PGKO mice gained significantly less body weight and adiposity (p < 0.01), which was associated with increased energy expenditure, locomotor activity, and respiratory quotient, while males did not have an overt change in energy homeostasis. Though PGKO mice of both sexes had comparable glucose and insulin tolerance, detailed analyses of liver gene expression and serum metabolites indicate that PGKO mice could have reduced  and increased lipid utilization on HFD. To elucidate the central-based mechanism(s) underlying the better-preserved energy and glucose homeostasis in PGKO mice on HFD, we examined the electrophysiological properties of POMC neurons and found Gpr17 deficiency led to increased spontaneous action potentials. Moreover, PGKO mice, especially female knockouts, had increased POMC-derived alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone and beta-endorphin despite a comparable level of prohormone POMC in their hypothalamic extracts.Gpr17 deficiency in POMC neurons protects metabolic homeostasis in a sex-dependent manner during dietary and aging challenges, suggesting that Gpr17 could be an effective anti-obesity target in specific populations with poor metabolic control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31178969>Antistress Effects of  Decoction on Restraint-Stressed Mice Revealed by H NMR-Based Metabolomics and Biochemistry Analysis.</a></h2><p> decoction (SHXXD), composed of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Coptidis Rhizoma, and Scutellariae Radix, is a representative antipyretic and detoxifying prescription in traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, we investigated the antistress effects and underlying mechanisms of  decoction (SHXXD) on restraint-stressed mice by H NMR-based metabolomics combined with biochemistry assay. A total of 48 male mice (5 weeks old, 18-22 g) were divided randomly into 6 groups ( = 8), including the normal group, restraint-stressed group, vitamin C group (positive drug, 17 mg/kg), and 3-dosage groups of SHXXD (200, 400, and 800 mg/kg). The stress model was induced by restraining mice in a polypropylene centrifuge tube for 6 h every day. The rotarod test was performed, and several biochemical indicators were measured. Moreover, other 24 animals were divided into 3 groups ( = 8) including the normal group, restraint-stressed group, and SHXXD group (800 mg/kg) for H NMR-based metabolomics analysis. Our results showed that SHXXD significantly increased the rotarod time, thymus index, spleen index, and the levels of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and interleukin- (IL-) 2, but decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-1, tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) , corticosterone (CORT), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in restraint-stressed mice. Moreover, the contents of eight endogenous metabolites that were changed by restraint stress were significantly reversed by SHXXD. The results of both metabolomics and biochemical analysis indicated that SHXXD (800 mg/kg, p.o.) could improve the biochemical changes and metabolic disorders in restraint-stressed mice by antioxidation and anti-inflammation, enhancing the body's immune function and restoring several disturbed metabolic pathways (i.e., lipid metabolism, glycolysis and , inflammatory injury, and energy metabolism). Taken together, these results indicated that SHXXD has a potential antistress effect in restraint-stressed mice and could be considered as a candidate drug for stress-related disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31282100>Exposure to recurrent hypoglycemia alters hippocampal metabolism in treated streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Exposure to recurrent hypoglycemia (RH) is common in diabetic patients receiving glucose-lowering therapies and is implicated in causing cognitive impairments. Despite the significant effect of RH on hippocampal function, the underlying mechanisms are currently unknown. Our goal was to determine the effect of RH exposure on hippocampal metabolism in treated streptozotocin-diabetic rats.Hyperglycemia was corrected by insulin pellet implantation. Insulin-treated diabetic (ITD) rats were exposed to mild/moderate RH once a day for 5 consecutive days.The effect of RH on hippocampal metabolism revealed 65 significantly altered metabolites in the RH group compared with controls. Several significant differences in metabolite levels belonging to major pathways (eg, Krebs cycle, , and amino acid metabolism) were discovered in RH-exposed ITD rats when compared to a control group. Key glycolytic enzymes including hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase were affected by RH exposure.Our results demonstrate that the exposure to RH leads to metabolomics alterations in the hippocampus of insulin-treated streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Understanding how RH affects hippocampal metabolism may help attenuate the adverse effects of RH on hippocampal functions.© 2019 The Authors.

While the metabolic program has been related to the expression of oncogenes, only fractional information is available on how variable precarious nutrient concentrations modulate the cellular levels of metabolites and their metabolic pathways. We thus sought to obtain an overview of the metabolic routes taken by C-glucose-derived metabolites in breast cancer MCF-7 cells growing in combinations of limiting glucose and glutamine concentrations. Isotopologue profiles of key metabolites were obtained by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). They revealed that in limiting and standard saturating medium conditions, the same metabolic routes were engaged, including glycolysis, , as well as the TCA cycle with glutamine and pyruvate anaplerosis. However, the cellular levels of C-metabolites, for example, serine, alanine, glutamate, malate, and aspartate, were highly sensitive to the available concentrations and the ratios of glucose and glutamine. Notably, intracellular lactate concentrations did not reflect the Warburg effect. Also, isotopologue profiles of C-serine as well as C-alanine show that the same glucose-derived metabolites are involved in  and pyruvate replenishment. Thus, anaplerosis and the bidirectional flow of central metabolic pathways ensure metabolic plasticity for adjusting to precarious nutrient conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174837> of Cancer Cells Is Disrupted by Citrate.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31468390>The Production of a Rat Model That Inhibits Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (PEPCK), a Rate-Limiting Enzyme of Hepatic .</a></h2><p>We previously showed that taurine administration contributed to the extension of time to exhaustion through exercise-induced hypoglycemia restraint, and we suggested that the activation of hepatic  was initiated before the exercise with the taurine administration.

The present study aims to investigate the hypoglycemic mechanisms of DOP based on the glucagon-mediated signaling pathways and the liver glycogen structure, which catalyze hepatic glucose metabolism, and provide new knowledge about the antidiabetic mechanism of DOP and further evidence for its clinical use for diabetes.DOP were obtained from the dry stems of Dendrobium officinale by water extraction and alcohol precipitation method. T2DM mice model was established by high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin. Liver histopathological changes were observed by H&E and PAS straining. Pancreatic histology was studied by H&E staining and immunofluorescence analysis. The levels of glucagon and insulin were detected by Elisa Kit and the hepatic glycogen content was detected by GOPOD. The expressions of the hepatic glycogen-related metabolism enzymes, hepatic  enzymes, and the related protein in cAMP-PKA and Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathways were detected by western blots. Liver glycogen was extracted from the liver tissues by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used to analyze the structure of liver glycogen.DOP could significantly affect the glucagon-mediated signaling pathways, cAMP-PKA and Akt/FoxO1, to further promote hepatic glycogen synthesis, inhibit hepatic glycogen degradation and hepatic . Moreover, DOP could reverse the instability of the liver glycogen structure and thus probably suppressed glycogen degradation. Thus, DOP finally would ameliorate hepatic glucose metabolism via glucagon-mediated signaling pathways and modifying liver-glycogen structure in diabetic mice.The hypoglycemic mechanism of DOP might be associated with the regulation of glucagon-mediated hepatic glycogen metabolism and , and of liver glycogen structure, contributing to improved hepatic glucose metabolism in diabetic mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of overexpression SREBP1a, a potent activator of all SREBP-responsive genes, on the intermediary metabolism of , a glucose-intolerant carnivorous fish. Administration of chitosan-tripolyphosphate nanoparticles complexed with a plasmid driving expression of the N-terminal transactivation domain of SREBP1a significantly increased SREBP1a mRNA and protein in the liver of . Overexpression of SREBP1a enhanced the hepatic expression of key genes in glycolysis- (glucokinase and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase), fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2), elongation (elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 5) and desaturation (fatty acid desaturase 2) as well as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate production (glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase) and cholesterol synthesis (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase), leading to increased blood triglycerides and cholesterol levels. Beyond reporting the first study addressing in vivo effects of exogenous SREBP1a in a glucose-intolerant model, our findings support that SREBP1a overexpression caused multigenic effects that favoured hepatic glycolysis and lipogenesis and thus enabled protein sparing by improving dietary carbohydrate conversion into fatty acids and cholesterol.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31549821>Whole Grain Brown Rice Extrudate Ameliorates the Symptoms of Diabetes by Activating the IRS1/PI3K/AKT Insulin Pathway in db/db Mice.</a></h2><p>The therapeutic benefits of whole grains on diabetes mellitus have been continuously confirmed by in-depth research. To date, limited studies have investigated the effect of extruded products of whole grains on the insulin signaling pathway in vivo. This study investigated the effects of oral consumption of whole grain extrudate, including 97% brown rice and 3% defatted rice bran (w/w, BRD), on glucose metabolism and the hepatic insulin signaling pathway in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. BRD treatment induced a remarkable reduction in blood glucose. Moreover, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance were ameliorated in the BRD-treated group compared with those in the db/db control group. BRD also increased the hepatic glycogen content by reducing the expression and increasing the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). The activities of glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and their respective mRNA expression levels in the liver were simultaneously decreased in the BRD-treated group. BRD also significantly upregulated the expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and increased the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and protein kinase B (AKT). These results indicate that BRD exhibits antidiabetic potential by activating the IRS1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, further regulating the expression of the  gene and p-GSK3β protein, thus inhibiting hepatic , increasing hepatic glycogen storage, and improving insulin resistance. Therefore, BRD could be used as a functional ingredient to alleviate the symptoms of hyperglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604973>Identification of Genes/Proteins Related to Submergence Tolerance by Transcriptome and Proteome Analyses in Soybean.</a></h2><p>Flooding can lead to yield reduction of soybean. Therefore, identification of flooding tolerance genes has great significance in production practice. In this study, Qihuang 34, a highly-resistant variety to flooding stress, was selected for submergence treatments. Transcriptome and proteome analyses were conducted, by which twenty-two up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs)/differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) associated with five KEGG pathways were isolated. The number of the DEGs/DEPs enriched in /gluconeogenesis was the highest. Four of these genes were confirmed by RT-qPCR, suggesting that /gluconeogenesis may be activated to generate energy for plant survival under anaerobic conditions. Thirty-eight down-regulated DEGs/DEPs associated with six KEGG pathways were identified under submergence stress. Eight DEGs/DEPs enriched in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were assigned to peroxidase, which catalyzes the conversion of coumaryl alcohol to hydroxy-phenyl lignin in the final step of lignin biosynthesis. Three of these genes were confirmed by RT-qPCR. The decreased expression of these genes led to the inhibition of lignin biosynthesis, which may be the cause of plant softening under submergence stress for a long period of time. This study revealed a number of up-/down-regulated pathways and the corresponding DEGs/DEPs, by which, a better understanding of the mechanisms of submergence tolerance in soybean may be achieved.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202663>Short communication: Effect of manipulating fatty acid profile on gluconeogenic gene expression in bovine primary hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>During the peripartum period, dairy cows experience both an increase in circulating fatty acid (FA) profile and a change in circulating FA profile, which have been shown to alter regulation of gluconeogenic genes. The objective was to quantify gene expression of key enzymes involved in  and FA transport into the mitochondria in primary hepatocytes in response to exposure to an FA mixture mimicking what is circulating in a transition dairy cow with or without enrichment of C16:0, C18:0, and C18:1. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from 4 Holstein bull calves 3 d of age (± standard deviation 2 d) and cultured. Twenty-four hours after plating, treatments were applied to the cells for 24-h incubation. Treatments consisted of (1) control (1% BSA), (2) 0.75 mM FA cocktail (3% C14:0, 27% C16:0, 23% C18:0, 31% C18:1, 8% C18:2, and 8% C18:3 to mimic the FA profile of dairy cattle at calving), (3) 0.90 mM FA cocktail, (4) 0.75 mM FA cocktail + 0.15 mM C16:0, (5) 0.75 mM FA cocktail + 0.15 mM C18:0, and (6) 0.75 mM FA cocktail + 0.15 mM C18:1. After harvest in Trizol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), samples were stored at -80°C until RNA extraction, purification, and reverse transcription. Abundance of mRNA was measured using quantitative real-time PCR. Expression of genes of interest [carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, pyruvate carboxylase, cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1), mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and glucose-6-phosphatase] was calculated relative to the average abundance of 2 reference genes (ribosomal protein L32 and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), which were the most stable out of 3 tested. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED (SAS version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) with the fixed effect of treatment and calf in the random statement. The addition of FA compared with the 1% BSA treatment increased the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A and cytosolic PCK1. Enrichment with individual FA did not further regulate pyruvate carboxylase or PCK1 beyond that achieved by the basal profile. These results suggest that shifts in circulating FA profile within a biological range, without a difference in the total FA concentration, have minimal effects on transcriptional regulation of hepatic gluconeogenic genes in primary bovine hepatocytes.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

SCFAs may exert multiple beneficial effects on human lipid and glucose metabolism. However, their actions and underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. In this study, we examined the direct effects of propionate on hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism using human HepG2 hepatocytes. Here, we demonstrate that propionate at a physiologically-relevant concentration effectively suppresses palmitate-enhanced glucose production in HepG2 cells but does not affect intracellular neutral lipid levels. Our results indicated that propionate can decline in  by down-regulation of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a major regulator of the hepatic glucose metabolism. Mechanistic studies also revealed that propionate-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation can be ascribed to Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) activation in response to an increase in intracellular Ca concentration. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the propionate receptor GPR43 prevented propionate-inducible activation of AMPK and abrogates the -inhibitory action. Thus, our data indicate that the binding of propionate to hepatic GPR43 elicits CaMKKβ-dependent activation of AMPK through intracellular Ca increase, leading to suppression of .

In this study, we evaluated ability of pterostilbene (PTS), a methoxylated analogue of resveratrol and a known antioxidant, to reverse palmitic acid (PA)-mediated IR in HepG2 cells. PTS prevented reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and subsequent oxidative lipid damage by reducing the expression of NADPH oxidase 3 (NOX3) in PA treated HepG2 cells. Hepatic glucose production was used as a measure of IR and PTS reversed PA-mediated increase in hepatic glucose production by reducing expression of genes coding for gluconeogenic enzymes namely glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and pyruvate carboxylase (PC); and their transcription factors cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and fork head class Box O (FOXO1) along with its coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1 α (PGC1α). PTS reversed PA-mediated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which in turn altered insulin signalling pathway by phosphorylating IRS-1 at Ser 307, leading to inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β. PTS also reduced PA-mediated lipid accumulation by reducing expression of transcription factors SREBP1c and PPARα. SREBP1c activates genes involved in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis while PPARα activates CPT1, a rate limiting enzyme for controlling entry and oxidation of fatty acids into mitochondria. PTS, however, did not influence PA uptake confirmed by using BODIPY-labelled fluorescent C16 fatty acid analogue. Thus, our data provides a possible mechanistic explanation for reversal of PA-mediated IR in HepG2 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573846>The Antagonist of CXCR1 and CXCR2 Protects db/db mice from Metabolic Diseases through Modulating Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Interleukin-8 (IL-8，also named CXCL8) binds to its receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2) with subsequent recruitment of neutrophils and enhancement of their infiltration into inflamed sites, which exaggerates inflammation in many diseases. Recent studies have proposed metabolic disorders can be attenuated by counteracting certain inflammatory signal pathways. In this study, we examined whether intervention with G31P, an antagonist of CXCL8, could attenuate tissue inflammation and development of metabolic disorders in db/db mice. The db/m and db/db mice were injected with G31P or equivalent normal saline for six weeks. The physical and metabolic parameters, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, hepatic lipid accumulation, and inflammation markers were measured. G31P improved hepatic insulin sensitivity by modulating expression of genes related to  and phosphorylated AKT level. The expressions of several genes encoding proteins involved in de novo lipogenesis (DNL) were decreased in G31P-treated db/db mice. Meanwhile, immune cells infiltration and cytokines release were attenuated in db/db mice with G31P treatment. G31P also improved the ratio of pro-inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Furthermore, G31P ameliorates inflammation-associated metabolic disorders via inhibition of CXCR1 and CXCR2 pathways.

We observed decreased food intake and decreased expression of agouti-related peptide (AgRP) following intracerebroventricular (icv) injections of adenoviral-mediated overexpression of three different S6Ks isoforms. Moreover, mice overexpressing p70-S6K1 in undefined periventricular hypothalamic neurons presented changes in glucose metabolism, as an increase in gluconeogenesis.

Gastrointestinal microflora is closely associated with the main factor of meat flavour, including fibre characteristics and lipid metabolism. Our method in this study involved different raising patterns within the semi free-grazing farm (FF) or indoor feeding farm (DF), the measurement of fat deposition and myofiber type by paraffin section and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and the identification of microbiome and functional capacities associated with meat quality through metagenomic sequencing.Results showed that the fat area in muscle and adipose tissue and the myofiber density significantly increased in the pigs of the FF group. The relative abundance of bacteria associated with lipid metabolism, such as g_Oscillibacter, in the feces of the FF group was higher than that in DF group, and the relative abundance of some bacteria with probiotic function, including g_Lactobacillus and g_Clostridium, was lower than that in DF group. The abundance of g_Clostridium was significantly positively correlated with the intramuscular fat area, whereas health-related bacteria, such as g_Butyricicoccus, g_Eubacterium, g_Phascolarctobacterium and g_Oribacterium, was significantly negatively correlated with abdominal fat area, myofiber density and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) mRNA expression. KEGG analysis showed that pigs raised in semi free-grazing farm can activate the pathway of inosine monophosphate (IMP) biosynthesis, glycolysis/ and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism.Free range feeding improves meat quality by changing the fibre type, myofiber density and metabolic pathways related to flavour amino acids, IMP or glycolysis/ in muscle.

Because of a short intergenic sequence between  and , a previous ApoA-IV knockout mouse model by gene targeting had an accompanying deficiency in ApoC-III expression, which limited its application in investigating the precise roles of ApoA-IV. To solve this problem, we created a specific knockout of ApoA-IV in Sprague-Dawlay rats by TALEN approach.Age-matched knockout rats and their wild-type littermate controls maintained on a standard rodent diet were studied and blood metabolic parameters were measured. Glucose, insulin, olive oil, and intralipid tolerance tests were performed to study the glucose and lipid metabolism of rats. Quantitative real-time PCR and RNA-seq analysis in liver and inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) of rats at three ages (18 weeks, 45 weeks and 90 weeks) were performed to identify the genes altered by ApoA-IV knockout.ApoA-IV knockout rats were apparently normal and fertile, but exhibited improved glucose clearance when challenged with glucose tolerance test. In addition, fasting-induced hepatic steatosis was more pronounced in ApoA-IV knockout rats. Further analysis identified that a set of hepatic genes involved in glycolysis,  and  lipogenesis were altered in the absence of ApoA-IV, which induced enhanced glycolysis, attenuated  and elevated  lipogenesis. And the RNA-seq results also confirmed that almost all the genes mentioned in the phenotyping section were highly consistent throughout the three studied ages.ApoA-IV functions in an age-independent manner in the modulation of glucose and lipid metabolism of rats, and may serve as a potential linker between hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31223231>Transcriptome Sequencing Analysis Provides Insights Into the Response to  in .</a></h2><p>Lily basal rot, caused by  f. sp. , is one of the most serious diseases of lily.

Recently, we showed that the S6K1 inhibitor PF-4708671 (PF) increases insulin sensitivity. However, we also reported that PF can increase glucose metabolism even in the absence of insulin in muscle and hepatic cells. Here we further explored the potential mechanisms by which PF increases glucose metabolism in muscle and liver cells independent of insulin. Time course experiments revealed that PF induces AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation before inhibiting S6K1. However, PF-induced glucose uptake was not prevented in primary muscle cells from AMPK α1/2 double KO (dKO) mice. Moreover, PF-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production was maintained in hepatocytes derived from AMPK α1/2-dKO mice. Remarkably, PF could still reduce glucose production and activate AMPK in hepatocytes from S6K1/2 dKO mice. Mechanistically, bioenergetics experiments revealed that PF reduces mitochondrial complex I activity in both muscle and hepatic cells. The stimulatory effect of PF on glucose uptake was partially reduced by expression of the  NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase in L6 cells. These results indicate that PF-mediated S6K1 inhibition is not required for its effect on insulin-independent glucose metabolism and AMPK activation. We conclude that, although PF rapidly activates AMPK, its ability to acutely increase glucose uptake and suppress glucose production does not require AMPK activation. Unexpectedly, PF rapidly inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity, a mechanism that partially underlies PF's effect on glucose metabolism.© 2019 Shum et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31389636>Mycobacterium tuberculosis requires glyoxylate shunt and reverse methylcitrate cycle for lactate and pyruvate metabolism.</a></h2><p>Bacterial nutrition is an essential aspect of host-pathogen interaction.

We discovered that Mtb is well adapted to use both lactate and pyruvate and that their metabolism requires , valine metabolism, the Krebs cycle, the GABA shunt, the glyoxylate shunt and the methylcitrate cycle. The last two pathways are traditionally associated with fatty acid metabolism and, unexpectedly, we found that in Mtb the methylcitrate cycle operates in reverse, to allow optimal metabolism of lactate and pyruvate. Our findings reveal a novel function for the methylcitrate cycle as a direct route for the biosynthesis of propionyl-CoA, the essential precursor for the biosynthesis of the odd-chain fatty acids.© 2019 The Authors.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) derived from the fermentation of plant-based nonsoluble fiber bind to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPR) GPR 41 and GPR 43 to induce enteroendocrine molecules that control appetite, and to upregulate intestinal  gene expression that controls glucose regulation. "Metabolic endotexemia" reflects a state of low-grade systemic inflammation that results from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) release from the gut into the systemic circulation in response to a high-fat diet. Inflammatory pathways induced by LPS, activation of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), and other inflammatory signaling pathways are mediators of systemic inflammation, insulin resistance and type II diabetes mellitus.Recent scientific data support that derangements in the composition of the microbiota, termed "microbiome dysbiosis" is a factor in the development of "metabolic endotoxemia" and T2DM. Therapeutic options that target the gut microbiome in the treatment of T2DM are explored.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31241462>Metabolic constraints drive self-organization of specialized cell groups.</a></h2><p>How phenotypically distinct states in isogenic cell populations appear and stably co-exist remains unresolved. We find that within a mature, clonal yeast colony developing in low glucose, cells arrange into metabolically disparate cell groups. Using this system, we model and experimentally identify metabolic constraints sufficient to drive such self-assembly. Beginning in a uniformly gluconeogenic state, cells exhibiting a contrary, high pentose phosphate pathway activity state, spontaneously appear and proliferate, in a spatially constrained manner. Gluconeogenic cells in the colony produce and provide a resource, which we identify as trehalose. Above threshold concentrations of external trehalose, cells switch to the new metabolic state and proliferate. A self-organized system establishes, where cells in this new state are sustained by trehalose consumption, which thereby restrains other cells in the trehalose producing, gluconeogenic state. Our work suggests simple physico-chemical principles that determine how isogenic cells spontaneously self-organize into structured assemblies in complimentary, specialized states.© 2019, Varahan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31203889>Photosynthesis and yield response to elevated CO, C plant foxtail millet behaves similarly to C species.</a></h2><p>Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) is a nutrient-rich food source traditionally grown in arid and semi-arid areas, as it is well adapted to drought climate. Yet there is limited information as how the crop responses to the changing climate. In order to investigate the response of foxtail millet to elevated [CO] and the underlying mechanism, the crop was grown at ambient [CO] (400 μmol mol) and elevated [CO] (600 μmol mol) in an open-top chamber (OTC) experimental facility in North China. The changes in leaf photosynthesis, chlorophyll ﬂuorescence, biomass, yield and global gene expression in response to elevated [CO] were determined. Despite foxtail millet being a C photosynthetic crop, photosynthetic rates (P) and intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi), were increased under elevated [CO]. Similarly, grain yield and above-ground biomass also significantly increased (P <  0.05) for the two years of experimentation under elevated [CO]. Increases in seeds and tiller number, spike and stem weight were the main contributors to the increased grain yield and biomass. Using transcriptomic analyses, this study further identified some genes which play a role in cell wall reinforcement, shoot initiation, stomatal conductance, carbon fixation, glycolysis /  responsive to elevated [CO]. Changes in these genes reduced plant height, increased stem diameters, and promote CO fixation. Higher photosynthetic rates at elevated [CO] demonstrated that foxtail millet was not photosynthetically saturated at elevated [CO] and its photosynthesis response to elevated [CO] were analogous to C plants.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To provide insights into its lignocellulose hydrolysate utilization, we performed C-pathway tracing, C-pulse-tracing, transcriptional profiling, biomass composition analysis, and metabolite profiling in conjunction with C-metabolic flux analysis (C-MFA) of phenol metabolism. We found that 1) phenol is metabolized mainly through the ortho-cleavage pathway; 2) phenol utilization requires a highly active TCA cycle; 3) NADPH is generated mainly via NADPH-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase; 4) active cataplerotic fluxes increase plasticity in the TCA cycle; and 5)  occurs partially through the reversed Entner-Doudoroff pathway (EDP). We also found that phenol-fed R. opacus PD630 generally has lower sugar phosphate concentrations (e.g., fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase) compared to metabolite pools in C-glucose-fed Escherichia coli (set as internal standards), while its TCA metabolites (e.g., malate, succinate, and α-ketoglutarate) accumulate intracellularly with measurable succinate secretion. In addition, we found that phenol utilization was inhibited by benzoate, while catabolite repressions by other tested carbon substrates (e.g., glucose and acetate) were absent in R. opacus PD630. Three adaptively-evolved strains display very different growth rates when fed with phenol as a sole carbon source, but they maintain a conserved flux network. These findings improve our understanding of R. opacus' metabolism for future lignin valorization.Copyright © 2019 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

Recent studies have reported its cardioprotective effect in glucocorticoid (GC)-induced hypertensive rats. Nevertheless, its beneficial role has not been investigated in the setting of GCs excess-induced insulin resistance. This study aimed to investigate the possible protective potential and the plausible mechanisms of pretreatment with PCA against GCs-induced insulin resistance, liver steatosis and vascular dysfunction. Insulin resistance was induced in male Wistar rats by a 7-day treatment with dexamethasone (DEX) (1 mg/kg/day, i.p.). PCA (50, 100 mg/kg/day, orally) was started 7 days before DEX administration and continued during the test period. PCA significantly and dose-dependently attenuated DEX-induced a) glucose intolerance (↓ AUC), b) hyperglycemia (↓ fasting blood glucose), c) impaired insulin sensitivity [↓fasting plasma insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index)] and d) dyslipidemia (↓total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol). PCA mitigated DEX-induced liver steatosis with associated reduction in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity. Moreover, PCA ameliorated DEX-induced vascular dysfunction and enhanced ACh-induced relaxation in aortic rings. The metabolic ameliorating effects of PCA might be attributed to the enhanced insulin signaling in soleus muscles (↑AKT phosphorylation) and mitigating  (↓ hepatic mRNA expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). The vasculoprotective effect of PCA might be related to its ability to restore normal mRNA expression of [endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and NADPH Oxidase 4 (NOX4)]. PCA restored normal oxidative balance [↓ oxidant species, malondialdehyde (MDA) and (↑ antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD)]. The findings herein reveal for the first time that PCA may be taken as a supplement with GCs to limit their metabolic and vascular side effects through its hypoglycemic, insulin-sensitizing, hypolipidemic and antioxidant effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Results showed that (-)-HCA decreased triglyceride content and lipid droplet counts, while these effects induced by (-)-HCA were reversed in chicken embryos pre-transfected with sh4-ALDH3A2. (-)-HCA decreased malic enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c mRNA level, while increased carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT1A) and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor α (PPARα) mRNA level; and the action of (-)-HCA on lipid metabolism factors had completely eliminated in embryos pre-transfected with sh4-ALDH3A2. Chicken embryos pre-transfected with sh4-ALDH3A2 had eliminated the increasing of serum glucose and hepatic glycogen content induced by (-)-HCA.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.Type 2 diabetic db/db mice are fed a chow diet with or without CAP treatment for 8 weeks. CAP administration markedly improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity through decreasing  and increasing glycogen synthesis in the liver. Furthermore, CAP inhibits the increase in abundance of the genus Lactobacillus and its bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity compared with levels in chow-fed mice, thereby leading to the accumulation of tauro-β-muricholic acid (TβMCA), a natural antagonist of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) that is involved in the regulation of BA and glucose metabolism. CAP-induced suppression of enterohepatic FXR-fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) signaling contributes to the increased BA pool size, followed by increases in the expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and hepatic BA synthesis. Additionally, depleting gut microbiota by antibiotics administration abolishes the beneficial effects of CAP on BA metabolism and glucose homeostasis.CAP-induced improvements in BA and glucose metabolism are partially mediated by the gut microbiota-BA-enterohepatic FXR axis in db/db mice.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Treatments to reduce hyperglycemia and reestablish normal insulin signaling are much sought after. Any agent which could be orally administered to restore INSR function, in an insulin-independent manner, would have major implications for the management of this global disease. We have discovered a non-peptidyl small molecule, adenosine, 5'-Se-methyl-5'-seleno-, 2',3'-diacetate [referred to as non-peptidyl compound #43 (NPC43)], which restores INSR signaling in the complete absence of insulin. Initial screening of numerous compounds in human HepG2 liver cells revealed that NPC43 significantly inhibited glucose production. The compound was potently anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperinsulinemic in vivo, in insulin-resistant T2D Lepr mice, following either acute or chronic treatment by oral gavage and intraperitoneal injection, respectively. The compound acted at the level of INSR and activated it in both liver and skeletal muscle of Lepr mice. In cell culture, the compound activated INSR in both liver and skeletal muscle cells; furthermore, it cooperated with insulin to depress glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6pc) expression and stimulate glucose uptake, respectively. Our results indicated that the compound directly interacted with INSRα, triggering appropriate phosphorylation and activation of the receptor and its downstream targets. Unlike insulin, NPC43 did not activate insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor in either liver or skeletal muscle. We believe this compound represents a potential oral and/or injectable insulin replacement therapy for diabetes and diseases associated with insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337681>Gid10 as an alternative N-recognin of the Pro/N-degron pathway.</a></h2><p>In eukaryotes, N-degron pathways (formerly "N-end rule pathways") comprise a set of proteolytic systems whose unifying feature is their ability to recognize proteins containing N-terminal degradation signals called N-degrons, thereby causing degradation of these proteins by the 26S proteasome or autophagy. Gid4, a subunit of the GID ubiquitin ligase in the yeast , is the recognition component (N-recognin) of the GID-mediated Pro/N-degron pathway. Gid4 targets proteins by recognizing their N-terminal Pro residues or a Pro at position 2, in the presence of distinct adjoining sequence motifs. Under conditions of low or absent glucose, cells make it through . When  grows on a nonfermentable carbon source, its gluconeogenic enzymes Fbp1, Icl1, Mdh2, and Pck1 are expressed and long-lived. Transition to a medium containing glucose inhibits the synthesis of these enzymes and induces their degradation by the Gid4-dependent Pro/N-degron pathway. While studying yeast Gid4, we identified a similar but uncharacterized yeast protein (YGR066C), which we named Gid10. A screen for N-terminal peptide sequences that can bind to Gid10 showed that substrate specificities of Gid10 and Gid4 overlap but are not identical. Gid10 is not expressed under usual (unstressful) growth conditions, but is induced upon starvation or osmotic stresses. Using protein binding analyses and degradation assays with substrates of GID, we show that Gid10 can function as a specific N-recognin of the Pro/N-degron pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31568486>Pyruvate produced by Brugia spp. via  is essential for maintaining the mutualistic association between the parasite and its endosymbiont, Wolbachia.</a></h2><p>Human parasitic nematodes are the causative agents of lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis) and onchocerciasis (river blindness), diseases that are endemic to more than 80 countries and that consistently rank in the top ten for the highest number of years lived with disability. These filarial nematodes have evolved an obligate mutualistic association with an intracellular bacterium, Wolbachia, a symbiont that is essential for the successful development, reproduction, and survival of adult filarial worms. Elimination of the bacteria causes adult worms to die, making Wolbachia a primary target for developing new interventional tools to combat filariases. To further explore Wolbachia as a promising indirect macrofilaricidal drug target, the essential cellular processes that define the symbiotic Wolbachia-host interactions need to be identified. Genomic analyses revealed that while filarial nematodes encode all the enzymes necessary for , Wolbachia does not encode the genes for three glycolytic enzymes: hexokinase, 6-phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase. These enzymes are necessary for converting glucose into pyruvate. Wolbachia, however, has the full complement of genes required for gluconeogenesis starting with pyruvate, and for energy metabolism via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Therefore, we hypothesized that Wolbachia might depend on host  to maintain a mutualistic association with their parasitic host. We did conditional experiments in vitro that confirmed that  and its end-product, pyruvate, sustain this symbiotic relationship. Analysis of alternative sources of pyruvate within the worm indicated that the filarial lactate dehydrogenase could also regulate the local intracellular concentration of pyruvate in proximity to Wolbachia and thus help control bacterial growth via molecular interactions with the bacteria. Lastly, we have shown that the parasite's pyruvate kinase, the enzyme that performs the last step in , could be a potential novel anti-filarial drug target.

It is well known that insulin resistance, especially hepatic insulin resistance, is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Current research has shown that hepatic fatty acid accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased , lipogenesis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway. Mitochondria are the major sites of fatty acid β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of fatty acids. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty acid-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty acid accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601271>Metabolic perturbations in mutants of glucose transporters and their applications in metabolite production in Escherichia coli.</a></h2><p>Most microorganisms have evolved to maximize growth rate, with rapid consumption of carbon sources from the surroundings. However, fast growing phenotypes usually feature secretion of organic compounds. For example, E. coli mainly produced acetate in fast growing condition such as glucose rich and aerobic condition, which is troublesome for metabolic engineering because acetate causes acidification of surroundings, growth inhibition and decline of production yield. The overflow metabolism can be alleviated by reducing glucose uptake rate.As glucose transporters or their subunits were knocked out in E. coli, the growth and glucose uptake rates decreased and biomass yield was improved. Alteration of intracellular metabolism caused by the mutations was investigated with transcriptome analysis and C metabolic flux analysis (C MFA). Various transcriptional and metabolic perturbations were identified in the sugar transporter mutants. Transcription of genes related to , chemotaxis, and flagella synthesis was downregulated, and that of gluconeogenesis, Krebs cycle, alternative transporters, quorum sensing, and stress induced proteins was upregulated in the sugar transporter mutants. The specific production yields of value-added compounds (enhanced green fluorescent protein, γ-aminobutyrate, lycopene) were improved significantly in the sugar transporter mutants.The elimination of sugar transporter resulted in alteration of global gene expression and redirection of carbon flux distribution, which was purposed to increase energy yield and recycle carbon sources. When the pathways for several valuable compounds were introduced to mutant strains, specific yield of them were highly improved. These results showed that controlling the sugar uptake rate is a good strategy for ameliorating metabolite production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645433>Glycerol induces  in primary mouse hepatocytes and is the preferred substrate for  both  and .</a></h2><p> (GNG) is  production of glucose from endogenous carbon sources. Although it is a commonly studied pathway, particularly in disease, there is a lack of consensus about substrate preference. Moreover, primary hepatocytes are the current gold standard for  liver studies but no direct comparison of substrate preference at physiologic fasting concentrations has been performed. We show that mouse primary hepatocytes prefer glycerol to pyruvate/lactate in glucose production assays and 13C-isotope tracing studies at the high concentrations commonly used in the literature as well as at more relevant fasting, physiologic concentrations. In addition, when glycerol, pyruvate/lactate, and glutamine are all present, glycerol is responsible for over 75% of all glucose carbons labeled. We also found that glycerol can induce a rate-limiting enzyme of GNG, glucose-6-phosphatase. Lastly, we suggest that glycerol is a better substrate than pyruvate to test  production of glucose in fasting mice. In conclusion glycerol is the major carbon source for GNG  and , and should be compared to other substrates when studying GNG in the context of metabolic disease states.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550253>A mitochondria-targeted fatty acid analogue influences hepatic glucose metabolism and reduces the plasma insulin/glucose ratio in male Wistar rats.</a></h2><p>A fatty acid analogue, 2-(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic acid (1-triple TTA), was previously shown to have hypolipidemic effects in rats by targeting mitochondrial activity predominantly in liver. This study aimed to determine if 1-triple TTA could influence carbohydrate metabolism. Male Wistar rats were treated for three weeks with oral supplementation of 100 mg/kg body weight 1-triple TTA. Blood glucose and insulin levels, and liver carbohydrate metabolism gene expression and enzyme activities were determined. In addition, human myotubes and Huh7 liver cells were treated with 1-triple TTA, and glucose and fatty acid oxidation were determined. The level of plasma insulin was significantly reduced in 1-triple TTA-treated rats, resulting in a 32% reduction in the insulin/glucose ratio. The hepatic glucose and glycogen levels were lowered by 22% and 49%, respectively, compared to control. This was accompanied by lower hepatic gene expression of phosphenolpyruvate carboxykinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in , and Hnf4A, a regulator of . Gene expression of pyruvate kinase, catalysing the final step of glycolysis, was also reduced by 1-triple TTA. In addition, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was reduced, accompanied by 10-15-fold increased gene expression of its regulator pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 compared to control, suggesting reduced entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. Indeed, the NADPH-generating enzyme malic enzyme 1 (ME1) catalysing production of pyruvate from malate, was increased 13-fold at the gene expression level. Despite the decreased glycogen level, genes involved in glycogen synthesis were not affected in livers of 1-triple TTA treated rats. In contrast, the pentose phosphate pathway seemed to be increased as the hepatic gene expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was higher in 1-triple TTA treated rats compared to controls. In human Huh7 liver cells, but not in myotubes, 1-triple-TTA reduced glucose oxidation and induced fatty acid oxidation, in line with previous observations of increased hepatic mitochondrial palmitoyl-CoA oxidation in rats. Importantly, this work recognizes the liver as an important organ in glucose homeostasis. The mitochondrially targeted fatty acid analogue 1-triple TTA seemed to lower hepatic glucose and glycogen levels by inhibition of . This was also linked to a reduction in glucose oxidation accompanied by reduced PHD activity and stimulation of ME1 and G6PD, favouring a shift from glucose- to fatty acid oxidation. The reduced plasma insulin/glucose ratio indicate that 1-triple TTA may improve glucose tolerance in rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31253511>Heterologous expression and functional analysis of the F-box protein Ucc1 from other yeast species in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</a></h2><p>The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays an important role in metabolic regulation. In a previous study, we reported that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, when glucose is available, the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex targets citrate synthase 2 (Cit2) for proteasomal degradation, thereby suppressing the glyoxylate cycle, an anabolic pathway that replenishes the TCA cycle with succinate for the activation of . However, the roles of Ucc1 in other yeast species remain unclear. Here, we cloned orthologs of the F-box protein Ucc1 from Zygosaccharomyces bailii, an aggressive food spoilage microorganism that is the most acetic acid-tolerant yeast species, and Candida glabrata, an emerging fungal pathogen. These orthologs were expressed in S. cerevisiae, and their activities were tested genetically and biochemically. The results showed that Z. bailii Ucc1 rescued the ucc1Δ phenotype, suggesting the existence of a similar mechanism regulating the glyoxylate cycle in Z. bailii. By contrast, C. glabrata Ucc1 did not complement the ucc1Δ phenotype or exhibit a dominant negative effect on Ucc1.

G6Pase and HK play an important role in insect growth by regulating the metabolism of glucose, leading to the efficient metabolism of other macromolecules.

We studied the potential functions of G6Pase and HK genes in the regulation of chitin metabolism pathways by RNAi technology. Interference with G6Pase expression did not affect trehalose and chitin metabolism pathways in brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål). However, knockdown of the HK gene resulted in a significant decrease of expression of genes associated with the trehalose metabolic pathway but had no significant effect on trehalase activity, trehalose content, or glucogen content. Additionally, HK knockdown resulting in downregulation of the genes involved in chitin metabolism in the brown planthopper. These insects also showed wing deformities and difficulty in molting to varying degrees.

Hepatic insulin resistance can result in increased release of glucose (from ) and free fatty acids (due to enhanced lipolysis), which can lead in turn to fetal overgrowth. However, the relationship between maternal metabolic factors (such as circulating levels of triglycerides, free fatty acids [FFA], or adipokines) and excessive fetal birthweight in NAFLD has not been carefully examined. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between NAFLD and the subsequent risk of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) birthweight.Singleton nondiabetic pregnant women were evaluated for the presence of fatty liver at 10-14 weeks of gestation by abdominal ultrasound. The degree of fatty liver was classified as Grade 0-3 steatosis. At the time of liver ultrasound, maternal blood was taken after fasting and measured for adiponectin and FFA. LGA was defined as birthweight >90th percentile for gestational age.A total of 623 women were included in the analysis. The frequency of LGA was 10.9% (68/623), and the frequency of NAFLD was 18.9%. The risk of LGA increased significantly in patients with Grade 2-3 steatosis in the first trimester. The relationship between Grade 2-3 steatosis and LGA remained significant after adjustment for maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, GDM, and maternal serum triglyceride levels. The concentration of maternal blood adiponectin at 10-14 weeks was significantly lower in cases with LGA than non-LGA, but the maternal blood FFA concentrations were not different between the groups.The presence of Grade 2-3 steatosis on ultrasound in early pregnancy was associated with the increased risk of delivering an LGA infant, even after adjustment for multiple confounding factors including GDM. Adiponectin may be the linking biomarker between NAFLD and LGA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31287224>MicroRNA-351 eases insulin resistance and liver  via the PI3K/AKT pathway by inhibiting FLOT2 in mice of gestational diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is known as different degree glucose intolerance that is initially identified during pregnancy.

Gestational diabetes mellitus mice exhibited IR and liver , up-regulated FLOT2, activated PI3K/AKT pathway and down-regulated miR-351 in liver tissues. Additionally, miR-351 overexpression and FLOT2 silencing decreased the levels of FLOT2, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, glyeosylated haemoglobin and homeostasis model of assessment for IR index (HOMA-IR), extent of PI3K and AKT phosphorylation, yet increased the levels of HOMA for islet β-cell function, HOMA for insulin sensitivity index and glucose transporter 2 expression, indicating reduced cell apoptosis in pancreatic tissues and alleviated IR and liver . Our results reveal that up-regulation of miR-351 protects against IR and liver  by repressing the PI3K/AKT pathway through regulating FLOT2 in GDM mice, which identifies miR-351 as a potential therapeutic target for the clinical management of GDM.© 2018 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31158601>Pathways and biomarkers of marbling and carcass fat deposition in bovine revealed by a combination of gel-based and gel-free proteomic analyses.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue (AT) deposits, either intramuscular (i.e., marbling) or at the carcass level, are major economic drivers in the beef industry. To identify biomarkers and unravel mechanisms of AT deposition, we combined gel-based and gel-free methods and we mined the differential proteome of the longissimus thoracis from cows differing by two levels of both carcass and muscular adiposities (CMA). We identified 47 proteins with abundances that varied according to CMA. We listed 26 new candidate biomarkers of marbling and confirmed 21 proteins already proposed in the literature. Seven proteins involved in glycolysis or  were the least abundant, while 14 proteins related to oxidative metabolism, slow-type muscle or retinoic acid metabolism were the most abundant in the high adiposity group. We highlighted eight proteins as differentially abundant and correlated with both CMA, thereby providing the first list of putative biomarkers of carcass adiposity. These proteins would be targeted in future studies aiming to categorize adiposity in cattle.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Metabolic composition of the human placenta could be affected by the presence of pathological states such as β-thalassemia. The aim of our study was to describe metabolic changes in chorionic villi samples of fetuses affected by β-thalassemia compared to a control group by applying a metabolomics approach.Chorionic villi samples were differentiated according to the genetic diagnosis of β-thalassemia: control (Group 1,  = 27); heterozygous (Group 2,  = 7); homozygous (Group 3,  = 7). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to detect the metabolic composition of the samples. Subsequently, multivariate and univariate statistical analysis was performed. The discriminant metabolites were used to identify the altered pathways.Supervised multivariate models were devised to compare the groups. The model resulting from the comparison between Group 1 and Group 3 was the most significant. Discriminant metabolites were identified, and the most altered pathways were as follows: pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), arachidonic acid metabolism, glycolysis, and , suggesting the presence of an energetic shift toward the PPP and the presence of oxidative stress in β-thalassemia chorionic villi samples.The metabolomics approach identified a specific metabolic fingerprint in chorionic villi of fetuses affected by β-thalassemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31388077>Metabolomics-based biomarker discovery for bee health monitoring: A proof of concept study concerning nutritional stress in Bombus terrestris.</a></h2><p>Bee pollinators are exposed to multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors. Understanding the effects of a single stressor in the complex environmental context of antagonistic/synergistic interactions is critical to pollinator monitoring and may serve as early warning system before a pollination crisis. This study aimed to methodically improve the diagnosis of bee stressors using a simultaneous untargeted and targeted metabolomics-based approach. Analysis of 84 Bombus terrestris hemolymph samples found 8 metabolites retained as potential biomarkers that showed excellent discrimination for nutritional stress. In parallel, 8 significantly altered metabolites, as revealed by targeted profiling, were also assigned as candidate biomarkers. Furthermore, machine learning algorithms were applied to the above-described two biomarker sets, whereby the untargeted eight components showed the best classification performance with sensitivity and specificity up to 99% and 100%, respectively. Based on pathway and biochemistry analysis, we propose that  contributed significantly to blood sugar stability in bumblebees maintained on a low carbohydrate diet. Taken together, this study demonstrates that metabolomics-based biomarker discovery holds promising potential for improving bee health monitoring and to identify stressor related to energy intake and other environmental stressors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31344131>Metal-independent variants of phosphoglycerate mutase promote resistance to nutritional immunity and retention of glycolysis during infection.</a></h2><p>The ability of Staphylococcus aureus and other pathogens to consume glucose is critical during infection. However, glucose consumption increases the cellular demand for manganese sensitizing S. aureus to host-imposed manganese starvation. The current investigations were undertaken to elucidate how S. aureus copes with the need to consume glucose when metal-limited by the host. A critical component of host defense is production of the manganese binding protein calprotectin. S. aureus has two variants of phosphoglycerate mutase, one of which is manganese-dependent, GpmI, and another that is manganese-independent, GpmA. Leveraging the ability to impose metal starvation in culture utilizing calprotectin revealed that the loss of GpmA, but not GpmI, sensitized S. aureus to manganese starvation. Metabolite feeding experiments revealed that the growth defect of GpmA when manganese-starved was due to a defect in glycolysis and not . Loss of GpmA reduces the ability of S. aureus to cause invasive disease in wild type mice. However, GpmA was dispensable in calprotectin-deficient mice, which have defects in manganese sequestration, indicating that this isozyme contributes to the ability of S. aureus to overcome manganese limitation during infection. Cumulatively, these observations suggest that expressing a metal-independent variant enables S. aureus to consume glucose while mitigating the negative impact that glycolysis has on the cellular demand for manganese. S. aureus is not the only bacterium that expresses manganese-dependent and -independent variants of phosphoglycerate mutase. Similar results were also observed in culture with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium mutants lacking the metal-independent isozyme. These similar observations in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens suggest that expression of metal-independent glycolytic isozymes is a common strategy employed by bacteria to survive in metal-limited environments, such as the host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31377934>Regulation of Glucose Production in the Pathogenesis of Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Increased glucose production associated with hepatic insulin resistance contributes to the development of hyperglycemia in T2D. The molecular mechanisms accounting for increased glucose production remain controversial. Our aims were to review recent literature concerning molecular mechanisms regulating glucose production and to discuss these mechanisms in the context of physiological experiments and observations in humans and large animal models.Genetic intervention studies in rodents demonstrate that insulin can control hepatic glucose production through both direct effects on the liver, and through indirect effects to inhibit adipose tissue lipolysis and limit gluconeogenic substrate delivery. However, recent experiments in canine models indicate that the direct effects of insulin on the liver are dominant over the indirect effects to regulate glucose production. Recent molecular studies have also identified insulin-independent mechanisms by which hepatocytes sense intrahepatic carbohydrate levels to regulate carbohydrate disposal. Dysregulation of hepatic carbohydrate sensing systems may participate in increased glucose production in the development of diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451389>Screen for fitness and virulence factors of Francisella sp. strain W12-1067 using amoebae.</a></h2><p>Francisella tularensis is the causative agent of the human disease referred to as tularemia. Other Francisella species are known but less is understood about their virulence factors. The role of environmental amoebae in the life-cycle of Francisella is still under discussion. Francisella sp. strain W12-1067 (F-W12) is an environmental Francisella isolate recently identified in Germany which is negative for the Francisella pathogenicity island, but exhibits a putative alternative type VI secretion system. Putative virulence factors have been identified in silico in the genome of F-W12. In this work, we established a "scatter screen", used earlier for pathogenic Legionella, to verify experimentally and identify candidate fitness factors using a transposon mutant bank of F-W12 and Acanthamoeba lenticulata as host organism. In these experiments, we identified 79 scatter clones (amoeba sensitive), which were further analyzed by an infection assay identifying 9 known virulence factors, but also candidate fitness factors of F-W12 not yet described as fitness factors in Francisella. The majority of the identified genes encoded proteins involved in the synthesis or maintenance of the cell envelope (LPS, outer membrane, capsule) or in the metabolism (glycolysis, , pentose phosphate pathway). Further C-flux analysis of the Tn5 glucokinase mutant strain revealed that the identified gene indeed encodes the sole active glucokinase in F-W12. In conclusion, candidate fitness factors of the new Francisella species F-W12 were identified using the scatter screen method which might also be usable for other Francisella species.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Yet, it is unknown whether sFRP4 action contributes to the development of these pathologies. Here, we determined whether sFRP4 expression in visceral fat associates with NAFLD and whether it directly interferes with insulin action and lipid and glucose metabolism in primary hepatocytes and myotubes. The association of sFRP4 with clinical measures was investigated in obese men with or without type 2 diabetes and with or without biopsy-proven NAFLD. To determine the impact of sFRP4 on metabolic parameters, primary human myotubes (hSkMC), or primary hepatocytes from metabolic healthy C57Bl6 and from systemic insulin-resistant mice, i.e. aP2-SREBP-1c, were used. Gene expression of sFRP4 in visceral fat from obese men associated with insulin sensitivity, triglycerides and NAFLD. In C57Bl6 hepatocytes, sFRP4 disturbed insulin action. Specifically, sFRP4 decreased the abundance of IRS1 and FoxO1 together with impaired insulin-mediated activation of Akt-signalling and glycogen synthesis and a reduced suppression of  by insulin. Moreover, sFRP4 enhanced insulin-stimulated hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL). In hSkMC, sFRP4 induced glycolysis rather than inhibiting insulin signalling. Finally, in hepatocytes from aP2-SREBP-1c mice, sFRP4 potentiates existing insulin resistance. Collectively, we show that sFRP4 interferes with hepatocyte insulin action. Physiologically, sFRP4 promotes DNL in hepatocytes and glycolysis in myotubes. These sFRP4-mediated responses may result in a vicious cycle, in which enhanced rates of DNL and glycolysis aggravate hepatic lipid accumulation and insulin resistance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Glucose, Prostaglandins and Lipids.</a></h2><p>Survival and growth of the bovine conceptus (embryo and associated extraembryonic membranes) is dependent on endometrial secretions or histotroph found in the uterine lumen. Previously, serial embryo transfer was used to classify heifers as high fertile (HF), subfertile (SF), or infertile (IF). Here, we investigated specific histotroph components (glucose, prostaglandins (PGs) and lipids) in the uterine lumen of day 17 pregnant and open fertility-classified heifers. Concentrations of glucose in the uterine lumen were increased by pregnancy, but did not differ among fertility-classified heifers. Differences in expression of genes encoding glucose transporters and involved with glycolysis and  were observed between conceptuses collected from HF and SF heifers. In the uterine lumen, PGE2 and PGF2α were increased by pregnancy, and HF heifers had higher concentrations of PGE2, PGF2α and 6-keto-PFG1α than SF heifers. Differences were found in expression of genes regulating PG signaling, arachidonic acid metabolism, and PPAR signaling among conceptuses and endometrium from fertility-classified heifers. Lipidomics was conducted exclusively in samples from HF heifers, and phosphatidylcholine was the main lipid class that increased in the uterine lumen by pregnancy. Expression of several lipid metabolism genes differed between HF and SF conceptuses, and a number of fatty acids were differentially abundant in the uterine lumen of pregnant HF and SF heifers. These results support the ideas that uterine luminal histotroph impacts conceptus survival and programs its development and is a facet of dysregulated conceptus-endometrial interactions that result in loss of the conceptus in SF cattle during the implantation period of pregnancy establishment.© The Author(s) 2019.

The role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the pathogenesis of diabetes has recently received increased attention. In the present study, we identified a novel lncRNA, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase-antisense (Bhmt-AS), and examined its expression patterns under pathophysiological conditions. Our results revealed that the expression of Bhmt-AS was significantly increased in the livers of fasted and db/db mice and was induced by gluconeogenic hormonal stimuli. The Bhmt-AS was also shown to be a concordant regulator of Bhmt expression. Functionally, depletion of Bhmt-AS suppressed hepatic glucose production both in vivo and in vitro. Adenovirus-mediated hepatic knockdown of Bhmt-AS improved pyruvate tolerance, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, overexpression of Bhmt restored the decreased glucose production caused by knockdown of Bhmt-AS in primary hepatocytes.

Here, we report a major role for the hormone-sensitive RNA-binding protein (RBP) APOBEC1 complementation factor (A1CF) in the generation of hepatocyte-specific and alternatively spliced transcripts. Among these transcripts are isoforms for the dominant and high-affinity fructose-metabolizing ketohexokinase C and glycerol kinase, two key metabolic enzymes that are linked to hepatic gluconeogenesis and found to be markedly reduced upon hepatic ablation of A1cf. Consequently, mice lacking A1CF exhibit improved glucose tolerance and are protected from fructose-induced hyperglycemia, hepatic steatosis, and development of obesity. Our results identify a previously unreported function of A1CF as a regulator of alternative splicing of a subset of genes influencing hepatic glucose production through fructose and glycerol metabolism.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

The molecular consequences of chronic insulin deficiency for the liver have not been studied systematically.We analyzed liver samples of a genetically diabetic pig model (MIDY) and of wild-type (WT) littermate controls by RNA sequencing, proteomics, and targeted metabolomics/lipidomics.Cross-omics analyses revealed increased activities in amino acid metabolism, oxidation of fatty acids, ketogenesis, and  in the MIDY samples. In particular, the concentrations of the ketogenic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) and of retinol dehydrogenase 16 (RDH16), which catalyzes the first step in retinoic acid biogenesis, were highly increased. Accordingly, elevated levels of retinoic acid, which stimulates the expression of the gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1), were measured in the MIDY samples. In contrast, pathways related to extracellular matrix and inflammation/pathogen defense response were less active than in the WT samples.The first multi-omics study of a clinically relevant diabetic large animal model revealed molecular signatures and key drivers of functional alterations of the liver in insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus.

To determine its role in the diabetic kidney, type 1 diabetic Akita mice with tubular NHE3 knockdown [Pax8-Cre; NHE3-knockout (KO) mice] were generated. NHE3-KO mice had higher urine pH, more bicarbonaturia, and compensating increases in renal mRNA expression for genes associated with generation of ammonium, bicarbonate, and glucose (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) in proximal tubules and H and ammonia secretion and glycolysis in distal tubules. This left blood pH and bicarbonate unaffected in nondiabetic and diabetic NHE3-KO versus wild-type mice but was associated with renal upregulation of proinflammatory markers. Higher renal phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression in NHE3-KO mice was associated with lower Na-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 and higher SGLT1 expression, indicating a downward tubular shift in Na and glucose reabsorption. NHE3-KO was associated with lesser kidney weight and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) independent of diabetes and prevented diabetes-associated albuminuria. NHE3-KO, however, did not attenuate hyperglycemia or prevent diabetes from increasing kidney weight and GFR. Higher renal  may explain similar hyperglycemia despite lower SGLT2 expression and higher glucosuria in diabetic NHE3-KO versus wild-type mice; stronger SGLT1 engagement could have affected kidney weight and GFR responses. Chronic kidney disease in humans is associated with reduced urinary excretion of metabolites of branched-chain amino acids and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, a pattern mimicked in diabetic wild-type mice. This pattern was reversed in nondiabetic NHE3-KO mice, possibly reflecting branched-chain amino acids use for ammoniagenesis and tricarboxylic acid cycle upregulation to support formation of ammonia, bicarbonate, and glucose in proximal tubule. NHE3-KO, however, did not prevent the diabetes-induced urinary downregulation in these metabolites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337282>A Liver-Specific Thyromimetic, VK2809, Decreases Hepatosteatosis in Glycogen Storage Disease Type Ia.</a></h2><p> Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD Ia), also known as von Gierke disease, is the most common glycogen storage disorder. It is caused by the deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase, the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of  and glycogenolysis. The accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate leads to increased glycogen and triglyceride levels in the liver. Patients with GSD Ia can develop steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and increased risk for hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. We previously showed that animal models of GSD Ia had defective autophagy and dysfunctional mitochondria. In this study, we examined the effect of VK2809, a liver-specific thyroid hormone receptor β agonist, on hepatic steatosis, autophagy, and mitochondrial biogenesis in a mouse model of GSD Ia.  -deficient (GSD Ia) mice were treated with VK2809 or vehicle control by daily intraperitoneal injection for four days. The hepatic triglyceride and glycogen were determined by biochemical assays. Autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis were measured by Western blotting for key autophagy and mitochondrial markers.  VK2809 treatment decreased hepatic mass and triglyceride content in GSD Ia mice. VK2809 stimulated hepatic autophagic flux as evidenced by increased microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3B-II), decreased p62 protein levels, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, enhancement of protein levels of ATG5-ATG12, and increased lysosomal protein expression. VK2809 also increased the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1α) and fibroblast growth factor 21 (), as well as mitochondrial biogenesis to promote mitochondrial β-oxidation.

The blood glucose-modifying variation within this gene regulates the abundance of both FOXN3 protein and transcript in primary human hepatocytes, with the hyperglycemia risk allele causing increases in both FOXN3 protein and transcript. Using transgenic and knock-out zebrafish models, we showed previously that FOXN3 is a transcriptional repressor that regulates fasting blood glucose by altering liver gene expression of MYC, a  master transcriptional regulator of glucose utilization, and by modulating pancreatic α cell mass and function through an unknown mechanism.

However, many are capable of switching into a wall-deficient L-form state in which they are resistant to antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis under osmoprotective conditions, including host environments. L-form cells may have an important role in chronic or recurrent infections. The cellular pathways involved in switching to and from the L-form state remain poorly understood. This work shows that the lack of a cell wall, or blocking its synthesis with β-lactam antibiotics, results in an increased flux through glycolysis. This leads to the production of reactive oxygen species from the respiratory chain, which prevents L-form growth. Compensating for the metabolic imbalance by slowing down glycolysis, activating  or depleting oxygen enables L-form growth in Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. These effects do not occur in Enterococcus faecium, which lacks the respiratory chain pathway.

In this study, female SD rats were orally treated with 0, 15, or 30 mg/kg·bw AA for 3 weeks. The levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood glucose after oral administration of glucose, plasma insulin and hepatic glycogen were measured. The histology of the pancreas was observed, and the transcription of key genes involved in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling in liver were determined. Compared with the control, exposure to 30 mg/kg·bw of AA significantly increased FBG level, reduced hepatic glycogen content and impaired glucose tolerance. Moreover, damaged islets were observed at 15 and 30 mg/kg·bw AA-exposed groups. In addition, AA exposure significantly promoted  and glycogenolysis (up-regulation of pc, g6p and gp) and decreased glycolysis (down-regulation of gck and pfk). Alternations in these processes may be associated with decreased plasma insulin levels and inhibited insulin-regulated IRS/PI3K/Akt/Foxo1 signaling transduction under AA exposure. Overall, our findings demonstrated that AA disrupted glucose homeostasis and elevated FBG level in female rats possibly by interfering with glucose metabolism and hampering the physiological effect of insulin.Copyright © 2019.

However, lack of complete genome, transcriptome and proteome information limits the understanding of the biology of H. flava. Here, the total RNA of H. flava was collected separately at larvae and nymph stages and analyzed with high-throughput RNA sequencing technology. The obtained data were assembled and annotated based on the near origin species in the Nr database. The functions of the unigenes were annotated and classified by seven databases, including Nr, Nt, Pfam, KOG, Swiss-Prot, GO and KEGG. A total of 61,850,967 and 79,579,368 clean reads were obtained with a data bulk of 9.28 G and 11.94 G in larvae and nymph stages, respectively. The number of unigenes was 440,896, with 48.6% of them being matched to the Nr database and 51.4% remaining unknown. Additionally, 1,776,404 SNPs were identified in the unigenes. Differential analysis revealed 80 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 56 up-regulated genes and 24 down-regulated genes in the nymph versus larvae. qPCR confirmed 4 of the 56 up-regulated genes and 4 of the down-regulated genes. KEGG analysis of the DEGs showed that aldehyde dehydrogenase and sorbitol dehydrogenase, two up-regulated unigenes in nymph versus larvae, were both matched to the top three enriched pathways: "chloroalkane and chloroalkene degradation", "fatty acid degradation" and "glycolysis and ". This is the first report on the whole transcriptome of H. flava at larvae and nymph stages. This study contributes to the understanding of H. flava at the gene expression level in different developmental stages and provides a theoretical basis for the development of vaccines against H. flava.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, OXT's short half-life in circulation and lack of receptor selectivity limit its application and efficacy. In this study, we report an OXT peptide analog (OXT) that is potent and selective for the OXT receptor (OXTR). OXT, but not OXT, activated vasopressin receptors  and acutely increased blood pressure  when administered IP. OXT suppressed food intake in mice, whereas OXT had a moderate effect on food intake when administered IP or intracerebroventricularly. Both OXT (IP) and OXT (IP) improved glycemic control in glucose tolerance tests. Additionally, both OXT (IP) and OXT (IP) stimulated insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1, and glucagon secretion in mice. We generated lipid-conjugated OXT (acylated-OXT) and OXT (acylated-OXT) and demonstrated that these molecules have significantly extended half-lives . Compared with OXT, 2-week treatment of diet-induced obese mice with acylated-OXT [subcutaneous(ly) (SC)] resulted in enhanced body weight reduction, an improved lipid profile, and gene expression changes consistent with increased lipolysis and decreased . Treatment with acylated-OXT (SC) also resulted in a statistically significant weight loss, albeit to a lesser degree compared with acylated-OXT treatment. In conclusion, we demonstrate that selective activation of the OXTR pathway results in both acute and chronic metabolic benefits, whereas potential activation of vasopressin receptors by nonselective OXT analogs causes physiological stress that contributes to additional weight loss.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31137550>Deep Insight into the Transcriptome of the Single Silk Gland of .</a></h2><p>The silk gland synthesizes and secretes a large amount of protein and stores liquid silk protein at an extremely high concentration. Interestingly, silk proteins and serine protease inhibitors are orderly arranged in the silk gland lumen and cocoon shells. Silk fiber formation and the spinning mechanism have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we conducted a comparative transcriptome analysis of seven segments of the single silk gland to characterize internal changes in the silk gland during the 5th instar of mature larvae. In total, 3121 differentially expressed genes were identified in the seven segments. Genes highly expressed in the middle silk gland (MSG) were mainly involved in unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, apoptosis-fly, and lysosome pathways, whereas genes highly expressed in the posterior silk gland (PSG) were mainly involved in ribosome, proteasome, citrate cycle, and glycolysis/ pathways. Thus, the MSG and PSG differ greatly in energy source use and function. Further, 773 gradually upregulated genes (from PSG to MSG) were involved in energy metabolism, silk protein synthesis, and secretion, suggesting that these genes play an important role in silk fiber formation.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as critical regulators of diabetes and other metabolic disorders. In this study, we found that the expressions of miRNA-27 family members, miRNA-27a and miRNA-27b (miR-27a/b) decreased significantly in the livers of diabetic mice. Moreover, the levels of miR-27a/b increased in the serum of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our present results showed that inhibition of miR-27a/b expression led to increased hepatic protein levels of G6pase and PEPCK and enhanced hepatic  in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of miR-27a/b suppressed hepatic glucose production and alleviated hyperglycemia in diabetic mice. Further study revealed that FOXO1 was a downstream target of miR-27a/b.

High ammonia levels in the brain are a major contributor to the decreased neural function that occurs in several pathological conditions such as hepatic encephalopathy when liver urea cycle function is compromised. Therefore, it is important to gain a deeper understanding of human ammonia metabolism. The objective of this study was to predict changes in blood ammonia levels resulting from alterations in dietary protein intake, from liver disease, or from partial loss of urea cycle function.A simple mathematical model was created using MATLAB SimBiology and data from published studies. Simulations were performed and results analyzed to determine steady state changes in ammonia levels resulting from varying dietary protein intake and varying liver enzyme activity levels to simulate liver disease. As a toxicity reference, viability was measured in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells following differentiation and ammonium chloride treatment.Results from control simulations yielded steady state blood ammonia levels within normal physiological limits. Increasing dietary protein intake by 72% resulted in a 59% increase in blood ammonia levels. Simulations of liver cirrhosis increased blood ammonia levels by 41 to 130% depending upon the level of dietary protein intake. Simulations of heterozygous individuals carrying a loss of function allele of the urea cycle carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS1) gene resulted in more than a tripling of blood ammonia levels (from roughly 18 to 60 μM depending on dietary protein intake). The viability of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells was decreased by 14% by the addition of a slightly higher amount of ammonium chloride (90 μM).Data from the model suggest decreasing protein consumption may be one simple strategy to decrease blood ammonia levels and minimize the risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy for many liver disease patients. In addition, the model suggests subjects who are known carriers of disease-causing CPS1 alleles may benefit from monitoring blood ammonia levels and limiting the level of protein intake if ammonia levels are high.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415856>Antibacterial mechanism of Tetrastigma hemsleyanum Diels et Gilg's polysaccharides by metabolomics based on HPLC/MS.</a></h2><p>Tetrastigma hemsleyanum Diels et Gilg (THDG) is used as a Chinese traditional anti-inflammatory medicine for about thousands of years. In this work, Tetrastigma hemsleyanum Diels et Gilg's polysaccharide (TP) can inhibit E. coli's growth in initial dosing period. Compared with the antibacterial effect of Achyranthe's polysaccharide (AP) from their metabolic profile, it's obviously that their metabolic sites for E. coli were inconsistent. Moreover, TP could not only increase the level of fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), decrease the level of fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FBP), but also charge the amount of the two differential metabolic with the change of the concentration and the dosing time. Actually, F6P could transform into FBP by catalyze of 6-phosphofructokinase-1(6-PFK-1), which is an important process in glycolysis. Furthermore, FBP was considered have positively correlated with E. coli's growth rate. Therefore, TP can inhibit the E. coli's proliferation by interfering with the process for glycolysis and . Based on the experimental result, we proposed a new mouthwash method to evaluate the anti-bacterial activity. Compared with AP, TP can inhibit the E. coli's growth within 2 h with a low concentration (0.5%) and a short dosing time (5 min).

To address whether in utero glucocorticoid exposure and fructose intake modulate metabolic responses, adult female Wistar rats were exposed to dexamethasone (DEX) during pregnancy, and the offspring were administered fructose at a later time. Briefly, dams received DEX during the third period of pregnancy, while control dams remained untreated. Offspring born to control and DEX-treated mothers were defined as CTL-off and DEX-off, respectively, while untreated animals were designated CTL-off-CTL and DEX-off-CTL.

Here, we investigated the metabolic impact of this intervention in 2-mo-old prediabetic University of California, Davis type 2 diabetes mellitus rats by assessing liver gene expression at 1.5 mo post-IT surgery. Pathway analysis indicated decreased signaling  TGF-β/Smad (a family of proteins named mothers against decapentaplegic homologs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), and PI3K-Akt-AMPK-mechanistic target of rapamycin, likely targeting hepatic stellate cells because differentiation and activation of these cells is associated with decreased signaling  PPAR and TGF-β/Smad. IT surgery up-regulated the expression of genes involved in regulation of cholesterol and terpenoid syntheses and down-regulated those involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism [including cardiolipin (CL)], lipogenesis, and . Consistent with the down-regulation of the hepatic CL pathway, IT surgery produced a metabolic switch in liver, kidney cortex, and fat depots toward decreased mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, the process required to fuel high energy-demanding pathways (,  and glyceroneogenesis), whereas opposite effects were observed in skeletal and cardiac muscles.

The decrease in dry matter intake during the peripartal period results in a considerable mobilisation of body tissues (mainly fat reserves and muscle mass) to compensate for the prevailing lack of energy and nutrients. Despite the activation of adaptive mechanisms to mobilise nutrients from body tissues for maintenance and milk production, the increased metabolic load is still a risk factor for animal health. The prevalence of production diseases, particularly subclinical ketosis is high in the early lactation period. Increased β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations further depress , feed intake and the immune system. Despite a variety of adaptation responses to nutrient and energy deficit that exists among dairy cows, an early and non-invasive detection of developing metabolic disorders in milk samples would be useful. The frequent and regular milking process of dairy cows creates the ability to obtain samples at any stage of lactation. Routine identification of biomarkers accurately characterising the physiological status of an animal is crucial for decisive strategies. The present overview recapitulates established markers measured in milk that are associated with metabolic health of dairy cows. Specifically, measurements of milk fat, protein, lactose and urea concentrations are evaluated. Changes in the ratio of milk fat to protein may indicate an increased risk for rumen acidosis and ketosis. The costly determination of individual fatty acids in milk creates barriers for grouping of fatty acids into saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Novel approaches include the potential of mid-IR (MIR) based predictions of BHB and acetone in milk, although the latter are not directly measured, but only estimated via indirect associations of concomitantly altered milk composition during (sub)clinical ketosis. Although MIR-based ketone body concentrations in milk are not suitable to monitor the metabolic status of the individual cow, they provide an estimate of the overall herd or specific groups of animals earlier in a particular stage of lactation. Management decisions can be made earlier and animal health status improved by adjusting diet composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31247150>ARHGAP21 deficiency impairs hepatic lipid metabolism and improves insulin signaling in lean and obese mice.</a></h2><p>ARHGAP21 is a Rho-GAP that controls GTPases activity in several tissues, but its role on liver lipid metabolism is unknown. Thus, to achieve the Rho-GAP role in the liver, control and ARHGAP21-haplodeficient mice were fed chow (Ctl and Het) or high-fat diet (Ctl-HFD and Het-HFD) for 12 weeks, and pyruvate and insulin tolerance tests, insulin signaling, liver glycogen and triglycerides content, gene and protein expression, and very-low-density lipoprotein secretion were measured. Het mice displayed reduced body weight and plasma triglycerides levels, and increased liver insulin signaling. Reduced  and increased glycogen content were observed in Het-HFD mice. Gene and protein expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein were reduced in both Het mice, while the lipogenic genes SREBP-1c and ACC were increased. ARHGAP21 knockdown resulted in hepatic steatosis through increased hepatic lipogenesis activity coupled with decreases in CPT1a expression and very-low-density lipoprotein export.

The proportion of the aged population is markedly increasing worldwide. The kidney, as an essential organ with a high energy requirement, is one of the most susceptible organs to aging. It is involved in glucose metabolism via , glucose filtration and reabsorption, and glucose utilization. Proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) depend on lipid metabolism to meet the high demand for ATP. Recent studies have shown that aging-related kidney dysfunction is highly associated with metabolic changes in the kidney. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α), a transcriptional coactivator, plays a major role in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, peroxisomal biogenesis, and glucose and lipid metabolism. PGC-1α is abundant in tissues, including kidney PTECs, which demand high energy. Many in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that the activation of PGC-1α by genetic or pharmacological intervention prevents telomere shortening and aging-related changes in the skeletal muscle, heart, and brain. The activation of PGC-1α can also prevent kidney dysfunction in various kidney diseases. Therefore, a better understanding of the effect of PGC-1α activation in various organs on aging and kidney diseases may unveil a potential therapeutic strategy against kidney aging.© 2019 The Authors.

Among its subtypes, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common. Recently, the mitochondrial isoform of the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (HsPEPCK-M) was identified as responsible for the metabolic adaptation in the NSCLC allowing tumor growth even under conditions of glucose deficiency. This adaptation is possible due to the role of HsPEPCK-M in , converting the oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate in the presence of GTP, which plays an important role in the energetic support of these tumors. In this context, it was shown that the inhibition or knockdown of this enzyme was able to induce apoptosis in NSCLC under low glucose conditions.In this study, novel putative inhibitors were proposed for the human PEPCK-M (HsPEPCK-M) based on a computer-aided approach.Comparative modeling was used to generate 3D models for HsPEPCK-M. Subsequently, the set of natural compounds of the ZINC database was screened against HsPEPCK-M models using structure-based pharmacophore modeling and molecular docking approaches. The selected compounds were evaluated according to its chemical diversity and clustered based on chemical similarity.The pharmacophore hypotheses, generated based on known PEPCK inhibitors, were able to select 7,124 candidate compounds. These compounds were submitted to molecular docking studies using three conformations of HsPEPCK-M generated by comparative modeling. The aim was to select compounds with high predicted binding affinity for at least one of the conformations of HsPEPCK-M. After molecular docking, 612 molecules were selected as potential inhibitors of HsPEPCK-M. These compounds were clustered according to their structural similarity. Chemical profiling and binding mode analyses of these compounds allowed the proposal of four promising compounds: ZINC01656421, ZINC895296, ZINC00895535 and ZINC02571340.These compounds may be considered as potential candidates for HsPEPCK-M inhibitors and may also be used as lead compounds for the development of novel HsPEPCK-M inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31172345>Effect of long-term thermal challenge on the Antarctic notothenioid Notothenia rossii.</a></h2><p>The thermal stability of the Antarctic Ocean raises questions concerning the metabolic plasticity of Antarctic notothenioids to changes in the environmental temperature. In this study, Notothenia rossii survived 90 days at 8 °C, and their condition factor level was maintained. However, their hepatosomatic (0.29×) index decreased, indicating a decrease in nutrient storage as a result of changes in the energy demands to support survival. At 8 °C, the plasma calcium, magnesium, cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations decreased, whereas the glucose (1.91×) and albumin (1.26×) concentrations increased. The main energy substrate of the fish changed from lipids to glucose due to a marked increase in lactate dehydrogenase activity, as demonstrated by an increase in anaerobic metabolism. Moreover, malate dehydrogenase activity increased in all tissues, suggesting that fish acclimated at 8 °C exhibit enhanced . The aerobic demand increased only in the liver due to an increase (2.23×) in citrate synthase activity.

Although different hypoglycemic drugs are used for this purpose, there is still a growing interest in the use of medicinal plants due to their low price, easy availability, and fewer or no side effects. Moringa (Moringa oleifera Lam.) is a medicinal plant that has been traditionally used in the management of diabetes. This review aims to present the existing literature published until February 2019 on the role of moringa leaves in glycemia and their physiological mechanisms. In the conducted studies, moringa leaves have shown to reduce glycemia, without causing any adverse effects. The proposed mechanisms for reducing glycemia include inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase activities, increased glucose uptake in the muscles and liver, inhibition of glucose uptake from the intestine, decreased  in the liver, and increased insulin secretion and sensitivity. However, these studies are limited in numbers and mostly conducted in animals, in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, long-term human studies are required to determine the hypoglycemic effect of moringa leaves, their physiological mechanisms, active ingredients, and safety.

We report a new high-resolution system to measure the stable carbon isotopic composition of carboxyl atoms within amino acids. The automated system used HPLC to separate amino acids followed by addition of ninhydrin for decarboxylation and transfer of the evolved CO2 to a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer for δ13CCARBOXYL measurement. The ninhydrin reaction was conducted at acidic pH (1.5) and elevated temperature (160 oC) giving yields close to 100% for most common amino acids.

Methyl ferulic acid (MFA) is a biologically active monomer isolated from the root of  Hasskarl. It has been reported that MFA has a hepatoprotective effect against alcohol-induced liver injury  and . However, the effect of MFA on ethanol-induced insulin resistance in ALD remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether MFA could exert protective effects against hepatic insulin resistance in ethanol-induced L-02 cells and ALD rats. ALD was induced in vivo by feeding Lieber-DeCarli diet containing 5% (w/v) alcohol for 16 weeks to Sprague-Dawley rats. Insulin resistance was induced  in human hepatocyte L-02 cells with 200 mM ethanol for 24 h followed by 10-7 nM insulin for 30 min. MFA exhibited the effects of inhibited insulin resistance, reduced enzymatic capacity for hepatic , and increased hepatic glycogen synthesis both  and . In addition, the results of transcriptome sequencing of liver tissues in the ethanol- and MFA-treated groups indicated that "pyruvate metabolism," "glycolysis/," and "fatty acid metabolism" were significantly different between ethanol- and MFA-treated groups. Further studies suggested that MFA activated the hepatic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway  and . Taken together, these findings suggested that MFA effectively ameliorated hepatic insulin resistance in ALD at least partially by acting on the PI3K/AKT pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659239>Uncarboxylated osteocalcin ameliorates hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice via activating insulin signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Osteocalcin, expressed in osteoblasts of the bone marrow, undergoes post-translational carboxylation and deposits in mineralized bone matrix. A portion of osteocalcin remains uncarboxylated (uncarboxylated osteocalcin, GluOC) that is released into blood where it functions as a hormone to regulate insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. As insulin resistance is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body insulin sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing  and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting fatty-acid β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181633>Comparative Proteomics Analysis of the Seedling Root Response of Drought-sensitive and Drought-tolerant Maize Varieties to Drought Stress.</a></h2><p>The growth and development of maize roots are closely related to drought tolerance. In order to clarify the molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance between different maize ( L.) varieties at the protein level, the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) quantitative proteomics were used for the comparative analysis of protein expression in the seedling roots of the drought-tolerant Chang 7-2 and drought-sensitive TS141 maize varieties under 20% polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000)-simulated drought stress. We identified a total of 7723 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), 1243 were significantly differentially expressed in Chang 7-2 following drought stress, 572 of which were up-regulated and 671 were down-regulated; 419 DEPs were identified in TS141, 172 of which were up-regulated and 247 were down-regulated. In Chang 7-2, the DEPs were associated with ribosome pathway, glycolysis/ pathway, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. In TS141, the DEPs were associated with metabolic pathway, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, and starch and sucrose metabolism. Compared with TS141, the higher drought tolerance of Chang 7-2 root system was attributed to a stronger water retention capacity; the synergistic effect of antioxidant enzymes; the strengthen cell wall; the osmotic stabilization of plasma membrane proteins; the effectiveness of recycling amino acid; and an improvement in the degree of lignification. The common mechanisms of the drought stress response between the two varieties included: The promotion of enzymes in the glycolysis/ pathway; cross-protection against the toxicity of aldehydes and ammonia; maintenance of the cell membrane stability. Based on the proteome sequencing information, the coding region sequences of eight DEP-related genes were analyzed at the mRNA level by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The findings of this study can inform the future breeding of drought-tolerant maize varieties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31234024>Protective effects of melatonin on sepsis-induced liver injury and dysregulation of  in rats through activating SIRT1/STAT3 pathway.</a></h2><p>Sepsis, a life-threatening disease with high morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients, usually leads to serious complications including liver damage and dysregulated metabolic homoeostasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of melatonin in rats with caecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis, which mimics critical infections in humans and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received CLP surgery under anaesthesia to induce polymicrobial sepsis. Melatonin (20 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected every 12 h for 7 days after CLP, with or without intraperitoneal injection of the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 (5 mg/kg). Markers of glucose metabolism, inflammation, liver function and associated signaling pathway were measured. Septic rats exhibited marked inhibition of the hepatic SIRT1/STAT3 pathway, along with increased blood glucose levels and hepatic . Melatonin administration efficiently attenuated liver dysfunction and glucose metabolism disorders by promoting hepatic SIRT1 expression and STAT3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, inhibition of SIRT1 by EX527 significantly diminished the protective effects of melatonin on sepsis induced liver injury, hyperglycaemia and STAT3 inactivation. These results emphasize that melatonin is a potential therapeutic agent for sepsis-associated liver injury and glucose metabolism disorders, possibly acting by targeting SIRT1-mediated STAT3 activation in the liver.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Although multiple clinical studies have implicated the expression of FSCN1 in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) progression, the precise mechanism of FSCN1 in the process has not been clearly elucidated. To define FSCN1 function, we characterized FSCN1-interacting proteins in LSCC cells by immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (MS). After data filtering, 119 proteins with expression in both the Hep-2 and TU-177 cell samples were identified as FSCN1-interacting partners. With in-depth bioinformatics analysis, we linked FSCN1 to critical cellular processes including cell adhesion, glycolysis/, regulation of protein ubiquitination, ribosomal RNA processing, and small molecule metabolism. We discuss the interactions between FSCN1 and some of the newly validated partners. The identification of these potential partners of FSCN1 expands our knowledge of the FSCN1 interactome and provides a valuable resource for understanding the functions of this protein in LSCC progression.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160397>Flexible Metabolism and Suppression of Latent Enzymes Are Important for  Adaptation to Diverse Environments within the Host.</a></h2><p>Bacterial metabolism is necessary for adaptation to the host microenvironment. Flexible metabolic pathways allow uropathogenic  (UPEC) to harmlessly reside in the human intestinal tract and cause disease upon extraintestinal colonization.  intestinal colonization requires carbohydrates as a carbon source, while UPEC extraintestinal colonization requires  and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. UPEC containing disruptions in two irreversible glycolytic steps involving 6-carbon (6-phosphofructokinase; ) and 3-carbon (pyruvate kinase; ) substrates have no fitness defect during urinary tract infection (UTI); however, both reactions are catalyzed by isozymes: 6-phosphofructokinases Pfk1 and Pfk2, encoded by  and , and pyruvate kinases Pyk II and Pyk I, encoded by  and  UPEC strains lacking one or both phosphofructokinase-encoding genes ( and ) and strains lacking one or both pyruvate kinase genes ( and ) were investigated to determine their regulatory roles in carbon flow during glycolysis by examining their fitness during UTI and  growth requirements. Loss of a single phosphofructokinase-encoding gene has no effect on fitness, while the  double mutant outcompeted the parental strain in the bladder. A defect in bladder and kidney colonization was observed with loss of , while loss of  resulted in a fitness advantage. The  mutant was indistinguishable from wild-type , suggesting that the presence of Pyk II rather than the loss of Pyk I itself is responsible for the fitness defect in the  mutant. These findings suggest that  suppresses latent enzymes to survive in the host urinary tract. Urinary tract infections are the most frequently diagnosed urologic disease, with uropathogenic  (UPEC) infections placing a significant financial burden on the health care system by generating more than two billion dollars in annual costs. This, in combination with steadily increasing antibiotic resistances to present day treatments, necessitates the discovery of new antimicrobial agents to combat these infections. By broadening our scope beyond the study of virulence properties and investigating bacterial physiology and metabolism, we gain a better understanding of how pathogens use nutrients and compete within host microenvironments, enabling us to cultivate new therapeutics to exploit and target pathogen growth requirements in a specific host environment.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31354667>A Novel Two-Component System, Encoded by the s/ Genes, Affects  Morphology in Liquid Culture.</a></h2><p> are mycelial bacteria adapted to grow in soil. They have become important producers of biomolecules with medical applications, but their growth in industrial fermenters is challenged by their peculiar morphology in liquid culture: the hyphae tend to clump and grow as large pellets, which are oxygen- and nutrient-limited, grow slowly and present diminished protein production. Here, by implementing an experimental evolution strategy, a  strain, 2L12, with dispersed morphology and reduced pellet size in liquid culture and no defects in either differentiation or secondary metabolism was selected. Genome sequencing revealed a single amino acid substitution in a sensor kinase, Sco5282, of unknown function to be responsible for the morphological changes. Moreover, genetic and biochemical scrutiny identified Sco5283 as the cognate response regulator and demonstrated that the acquired mutation activates this two-component system. Finally, transcriptomic analysis of the mutant strain revealed changes in expression of genes involved in central processes such as glycolysis, , stress-signaling pathways, proteins secretion and cell envelope metabolism. Thus a novel two-component system is proposed to play a key role in the control of  extracellular metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306684>Tributyltin exposure disturbs hepatic glucose metabolism in male mice.</a></h2><p>Some previous studies showed that organotin compounds induced diabetes in animal models. The underlying mechanisms should be further revealed. In this study, male KM mice were exposed to tributyltin (TBT) at 0.5, 5 and 50 μg/kg once every three days for 45 days. The TBT-treated mice exhibited an elevation of fasting blood glucose level and glucose intolerance. The fasting serum insulin levels were increased and reached a significant difference in the 50 μg/kg group; the glucagon levels were significantly decreased in all the treatments. Pancreatic β-cell mass was significantly decreased in all the treatments; α-cell mass showed a significant decrease in the 5 and 50 ug/kg groups. The transcription of pancreatic insulin gene (Ins2) showed an up-regulation and reached a significant difference in the 5 and 50 μg/kg groups, which would be responsible for the increased serum insulin levels. The transcription of glucagon gene (Gcg) in the pancreas was significantly down-regulated in the 5 and 50 ug/kg groups. The protein expression of hepatic glucagon receptor was down-regulated, while the expression of glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was up-regulated accompanied by increased hepatic glycogen content. These results indicated that hepatic  was enhanced during insulin resistance stage caused by TBT exposure, which would exert a potential risk inducing the development of diabetes mellitus.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To elucidate the underlying mechanism by which DEHP or MEHP perturbs hepatic glucose homeostasis, we compared the effect of DEHP (0-200 μM) and MEHP (0-200 μM) on glucose metabolism in HepG2 cells. In this study, we found that MEHP can induce more severe impairments in glucose homeostasis than DEHP can; these include increased hepatic  via receptor substrate-1/protein kinase B/fork-head box protein O1 (IRS-1/AKT/FOXO1)-mediated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) up-regulation, as well as decreased hepatic glycogen synthesis via glucokinase (GCK) inhibition and IRS-1/AKT/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)-mediated glycogen synthase (GYS) inactivation. Additionally, our results demonstrated that retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), an insulin resistance-inducing factor, plays a critical role in the MEHP-induced disorder of glucose homeostasis and the dysfunction of insulin signaling transduction, whereas the deletion of RBP4 by the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) significantly reversed these toxic effects. Although these should be interpreted with caution in view of limited in vivo evidence, the present study provides the first in vitro evidence for potential involvements of RBP4 in disturbance of glucose homeostasis in the MEHP-treated HepG2 cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To fill this gap, we captured House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) from rural and urban environments and hypothesized that increased access to human refuse in urban areas may significantly alter the gut microbiome and nutritional physiology of Sparrows. While there were no significant differences in circulating triglycerides or free glycerol concentrations between populations, urban birds had significantly greater blood glucose concentrations, which suggests greater circulating glucagon concentrations, accessibility to carbohydrates, and/or higher rates of  in an urban setting. Rural birds had significantly more plasma uric acid, suggesting that they may metabolize more proteins or experience lower inflammation than urban birds. Rural birds also had significantly higher liver free glycerol concentrations, indicating that they metabolize more fat than urban birds. There were no significant differences in the relative abundance of gut microbial taxa at the phyla level between the two populations, but linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) showed that urban House Sparrows were more enriched with class- and order-level microbes from the phylum Proteobacteria, which are implicated in several mammalian intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases. These findings demonstrate that urbanization significantly alters the nutritional physiology and the composition of the gut microbiome of House Sparrows.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, chronic elevation of cortisol has detrimental effects and has been studied extensively in lab settings. However, data pertaining to wild teleosts are lacking. Here, we characterized the metabolic consequences of prolonged cortisol elevation (96 h) in wild-caught pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus). Pumpkinseed were implanted with cocoa butter alone (sham) or containing cortisol (25 mg kg body weight), and at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, tissue samples were collected, whole-body ammonia excretion was determined, and whole-organism metabolism was assessed using intermittent flow respirometry. Cortisol-treated pumpkinseed exhibited the highest plasma cortisol concentration at 24 h post-implantation, with levels decreasing over the subsequent time points although remaining higher than in sham-treated fish. Cortisol-treated fish exhibited higher standard and maximal metabolic rates than sham-treated fish, but the effect of cortisol treatment on aerobic scope was negligible. Indices of energy synthesis/mobilization, including blood glucose concentrations, hepatosomatic index, hepatic glycogen concentrations, and ammonia excretion rates, were higher in cortisol-treated fish compared with controls. Our work suggests that although aerobic scope was not diminished by prolonged elevation of cortisol levels, higher metabolic expenditures may be of detriment to the animal's performance in the longer term.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31222525>Deciphering the uranium target proteins in human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells.</a></h2><p>Uranium (U) is the heaviest naturally occurring element ubiquitously present in the Earth's crust. Human exposure to low levels of U is, therefore, unavoidable. Recently, several studies have clearly pointed out that the brain is a sensitive target for U, but the mechanisms leading to the observed neurological alterations are not fully known. To deepen our knowledge of the biochemical disturbances resulting from U(VI) toxicity in neuronal cells, two complementary strategies were set up to identify the proteins that selectively bind U(VI) in human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells. The first strategy relies on the selective capture of proteins capable of binding U(VI), using immobilized metal affinity chromatography, and starting from lysates of cells grown in a U(VI)-free medium. The second strategy is based on the separation of U-enriched protein fractions by size-exclusion chromatography, starting from lysates of U(VI)-exposed cells. High-resolution mass spectrometry helped us to highlight 269 common proteins identified as the urano-proteome. They were further analyzed to characterize their cellular localization and biological functions. Four canonical pathways, related to the protein ubiquitination system, , glycolysis, and the actin cytoskeleton proteins, were particularly emphasized due to their high content of U(VI)-bound proteins. A semi-quantification was performed to concentrate on the ten most abundant proteins, whose physico-chemical characteristics were studied in particular depth. The selective interaction of U(VI) with these proteins is an initial element of proof of the possible metabolic effects of U(VI) on neuronal cells at the molecular level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308441>Poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy and lactation activates the Foxo1 pathway and causes glucose intolerance in adult offspring.</a></h2><p>Exposure to maternal diabetes during pregnancy results in diabetes in offspring, but its underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigated the phenotype and molecular defects of the offspring of poorly controlled diabetic female mice generated by streptozotocin (STZ) administration. Offspring was exposed to maternal diabetes during pregnancy and lactation. The body weight of STZ offspring was lower than that of control offspring at birth and in adulthood, and glucose tolerance was impaired in adult STZ offspring. Interestingly, the phenotype was more pronounced in male offspring. We next investigated the morphology of islets and expression of β cell-related genes, but no significant changes were observed. However, transcriptome analysis of the liver revealed activation of the fork head box protein O1 (Foxo1) pathway in STZ male offspring. Notably, two key  enzyme genes, glucose 6 phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6pc) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (Pck1), were upregulated. Consistent with this finding, phosphorylation of Foxo1 was decreased in the liver of STZ male offspring. These changes were not obvious in female offspring. The activation of Foxo1 and  in the liver may have contributed to the impaired glucose tolerance of STZ male offspring.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31375125>Schistosoma japonicum infection causes a reprogramming of glycolipid metabolism in the liver.</a></h2><p>Recent investigations indicate that schistosome infection is closely associated with aberrant glycolipid metabolism. However, the actual glycolipid metabolism gene expression, as well as the possible pathways that regulate glycolipid metabolism in the schistosome-infected liver, has not been extensively explored.In this study, we evaluated the dynamic expression of glycolipid metabolism-associated genes and proteins in the livers from mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum at the indicated time points using real-time PCR and immunofluorescence. Then, cultures of macrophages were treated with schistosome soluble egg antigen (SEA) to detect the expression levels of genes associated with glucose and lipid metabolism in order to identify macrophages metabolic characteristics in response to these antigens. Furthermore, SEA-stimulated macrophages were co-cultures with hepatocytes and detected the effects of macrophages on the gene expression of hepatocytes metabolism.The expression of glycolysis-related genes (Ldha, Glut4, Pkm2, Glut1, Pfkfb3, Aldoc, HK2, Pfk) in the liver were upregulated but the  gene (G6pc) was downregulated during S. japonicum infection. In addition, the mRNA levels of fatty acid (FA) oxidation-related genes (Ucp2, Atp5b, Pparg) in the liver were significantly upregulated; however, the FA synthesis genes (Fas, Acc, Scd1, Srebp1c) and lipid uptake gene (Cd36) were downregulated post-S. japonicum-infection. In consistence with these data, stimulation with SEA in vitro significantly enhanced the gene expression that involved in glycolysis and FA oxidation, but decreased genes related to , FA synthesis and lipid uptake in macrophages. The levels of phosphorylated AMPK, AKT and mTORC1 were increased in macrophages after SEA stimulation. Inhibition of phosphorylated AMPK, AKT and mTORC1 promoted SEA-treated macrophages to produce glucose. In addition, suppression of phosphorylated-AMPK, but not phosphorylated-AKT and phosphorylated-mTOR, induced the lipid accumulation in SEA-stimulated macrophages. Furthermore, SEA-treated macrophages significantly reduced the expression of Acc mRNA in hepatocytes in vitro.These findings reveal S. japonicum infection induces dynamic changes in the expression levels of genes involved in catabolism (glucose uptake, glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation) and suppressing anabolism (glycogen synthesis) in the liver, which could occur via macrophages' metabolic states, particularly those involved in the AMPK, AKT and mTORC1 pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642595>GABA-A receptor and mitochondrial TSPO signaling act in parallel to regulate melanocyte stem cell quiescence in larval zebrafish.</a></h2><p>Tissue regeneration and homeostasis often require recruitment of undifferentiated precursors (adult stem cells; ASCs). While many ASCs continuously proliferate throughout the lifetime of an organism, others are recruited from a quiescent state to replenish their target tissue. A longstanding question in stem cell biology concerns how long-lived, non-dividing ASCs regulate the transition between quiescence and proliferation. We study the melanocyte stem cell (MSC) to investigate the molecular pathways that regulate ASC quiescence. Our prior work indicated that GABA-A receptor activation promotes MSC quiescence in larval zebrafish. Here, through pharmacological and genetic approaches we show that GABA-A acts through calcium signaling to maintain MSC quiescence. Unexpectedly, we identified translocator protein (TSPO), a mitochondrial membrane associated protein that regulates mitochondrial function and metabolic homeostasis, as a parallel regulator of MSC quiescence. We found that both TSPO-specific ligands and induction of  likely act in the same pathway to promote MSC activation and melanocyte production in larval zebrafish. In contrast, TSPO and  appear to act in parallel to GABA-A receptor signaling to regulate MSC quiescence and vertebrate pigment patterning.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to measure metabolic intermediates derived from uniformly labeled C-glucose or [3-C]l-lactate, we investigated the contribution of PC to anaplerosis and cataplerosis in the liver cell line HepG2. Suppression of PC expression by short hairpin RNA lowered incorporation of C glucose incorporation into tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, aspartate, glutamate and sugar derivatives, indicating impaired cataplerosis. The perturbation of these biosynthetic pathways is accompanied by a marked decrease of cell viability and proliferation. In contrast, under gluconeogenic conditions where the HepG2 cells use lactate as a carbon source, pyruvate carboxylation contributed very little to the maintenance of these metabolites. Suppression of PC did not affect the percent incorporation of C-labeled carbon from lactate into citrate, α-ketoglutarate, malate, succinate as well as aspartate and glutamate, suggesting that under gluconeogenic condition, PC does not support cataplerosis from lactate.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the activities of these pathways in hepatomas in vivo have not been distinguished. Here we examined pyruvate entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle through PDH versus PC in vivo using hepatoma-bearing rats.Hepatoma-bearing rats were generated by intrahepatic injection of H4IIE cells. Metabolism of C-labeled glycerol, a physiological substrate for both  and energy production, was measured with C NMR analysis. The concentration of key metabolites and the expression of relevant enzymes were measured in hepatoma, surrounding liver, and normal liver.In orthotopic hepatomas, pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle occurred exclusively through PDH and the excess PDH activity compared to normal liver was attributed to downregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 2/4. However, pyruvate carboxylation via PC and  were minimal, which was linked to downregulated forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) by Akt activity. In contrast to many studies of cancer metabolism, lactate production in hepatomas was not increased which corresponded to reduced expression of lactate dehydrogenase. The production of serine and glycine in hepatomas was enhanced, but glycine decarboxylase was downregulated.The combination of [U-C]glycerol and NMR analysis enabled investigation of multiple biochemical processes in hepatomas and surrounding liver. We demonstrated active PDH and other related metabolic alterations in orthotopic hepatomas that differed substantially not only from the host organ but also from many earlier studies with cancer cells.Copyright © 2019.

The encoding gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and the gene product was characterized. The recombinant protein was produced in soluble and active form. Phosphofructokinase activity of TK0376 was metal-ion dependent and the highest activity (5090 μmol min mg) was found in the presence of Co followed by Mg (3280 μmol min mg) at 90°C and pH 7.5. TK0376 preferred ADP as phosphoryl donor, however, it could be replaced by ATP but with a 5-fold lower activity. It catalyzed the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate and dephosphorylation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. In addition, it was able to phosphorylate glucose and nucleosides but with a much lower rate compared to that of fructose 6-phosphate. The apparent k and K values against fructose 6-phosphate were 4238 s and 0.74 mM, respectively. The rate of dephosphorylation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was 3-times lower at 50°C than the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate. Similarly, the rate of phosphorylation of glucose was 450-fold lower than that of fructose 6-phosphate.

This study evaluated the effects of water-soluble proteins of Korean pine nut obtained from a dilute alkali extract on carbohydrate metabolism of type 2 diabetic mice on a model of diabetes induced using a high fat diet combined with streptozotocin. The results showed that the hypoglycemic effect of PNP at a middle dose was the most significant, which was 38.7% lower than that of control. The extract significantly improved the oral glucose tolerance and liver indexes, increased the activity of the carbohydrate metabolism enzymes, and regulated the expression of the function of key genes for carbohydrate metabolism. It had a positive effect on both insulin resistance and glycolytic/ signaling. In conclusion, PNP can regulate fasting blood glucose, improve insulin resistance, correct the glucose metabolism disorder in diabetic mice, and have a positive regulatory role. As the functional food, it has the potential to be beneficial in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus as a new hypoglycemic functional food.Copyright © 2019.

PAHSAs reduce ambient glycemia and improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant aged chow- and high-fat diet-fed (HFD-fed) mice. Here, we aimed to determine the mechanisms by which PAHSAs improve insulin sensitivity. Both acute and chronic PAHSA treatment enhanced the action of insulin to suppress endogenous glucose production (EGP) in chow- and HFD-fed mice. Moreover, chronic PAHSA treatment augmented insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in glycolytic muscle and heart in HFD-fed mice. The mechanisms by which PAHSAs enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity included direct and indirect actions involving intertissue communication between adipose tissue and liver. PAHSAs inhibited lipolysis directly in WAT explants and enhanced the action of insulin to suppress lipolysis during the clamp in vivo. Preventing the reduction of free fatty acids during the clamp with Intralipid infusion reduced PAHSAs' effects on EGP in HFD-fed mice but not in chow-fed mice. Direct hepatic actions of PAHSAs may also be important, as PAHSAs inhibited basal and glucagon-stimulated EGP directly in isolated hepatocytes through a cAMP-dependent pathway involving Gαi protein-coupled receptors. Thus, this study advances our understanding of PAHSA biology and the physiologic mechanisms by which PAHSAs exert beneficial metabolic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612029>Screening and identification of key biomarkers in lung squamous cell carcinoma by bioinformatics analysis.</a></h2><p>The high mortality rate of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is in part due to the lack of early detection of its biomarkers.

Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were conducted to construct the protein-protein interaction network of DEGs and hub genes module using STRING and Cytoscape. The 67 DEGs identified consisted of 42 upregulated genes and 25 downregulated genes. The pathways predicted by KEGG and GO enrichment analyses of DEGs mainly included cell cycle, cell proliferation, glycolysis or , and tetrahydrofolate metabolic process. Further analysis of the University of California Santa Cruz and ONCOMINE databases identified 17 hub genes. Overall, the present study demonstrated hub genes that were closely associated with clinical tissue samples of LUSC, and identified TYMS, CCNB2 and RFC4 as potential novel biomarkers of LUSC. The findings of the present study contribute to an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis and progression of LUSC, and assist with the identification of potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets of LUSC.Copyright: © Man et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551816>BCAA Catabolic Defect Alters Glucose Metabolism in Lean Mice.</a></h2><p>Recent studies show branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic pathway is defective in obese animals and humans, contributing to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and diabetes. However, in the context of obesity, various processes including the dysfunctional lipid metabolism can affect insulin sensitivity and glycemic regulation. It remains unclear how BCAA catabolic defect may exert direct impacts on glucose metabolism without the disturbance of obesity. The current study characterized the glucose metabolism in lean mice in which the genetic deletion of PP2Cm leads to moderate BCAA catabolic defect. Interestingly, compared to the wildtype control, lean PP2Cm deficient mice showed enhanced insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, lower body weight, and the preference for carbohydrate over lipids utilization. Metabolomics profiling of plasma and tissues revealed significantly different metabolic patterns in the PP2Cm deficient mice, featured by the marked alterations in glucose metabolic processes, including /glycolysis, glycogen metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. The metabolic changes of glucose were predominantly observed in liver but not skeletal muscle or white adipose tissue. The elevated branched-chain keto acids (BCKAs) resulted from the BCAA catabolic defect may play a critical role in regulating the expression of key regulators of glucose metabolic processes and the activity of respiratory Complex II/succinate dehydrogenase in TCA cycle. Together, these results show BCAA catabolic defect significantly alters glucose metabolism in lean mice with some impacts different or even opposite from those in obese mice, highlighting the critical role of BCAA catabolism in glycemic regulation and the complex interplay between macronutrients in lean and obese animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619395>Rapid Growth and Metabolism of Uropathogenic Escherichia coli in Relation to Urine Composition.</a></h2><p>SUMMARYUropathogenic  (UPEC) strains cause a majority of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Since UPEC strains can become antibiotic resistant, adjunct or alternate therapies are urgently needed. UPEC strains grow extremely rapidly in patients with UTIs. Thus, this review focuses on the relation between urine composition and UPEC growth and metabolism. Compilation of urinary components from two major data sources suggests the presence of sufficient amino acids and carbohydrates as energy sources and abundant phosphorus, sulfur, and nitrogen sources. In a mouse UTI model, mutants lacking enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, , and the nonoxidative branch of the pentose cycle are less competitive than the corresponding parental strains, which is consistent with amino acids as major energy sources. Other evidence suggests that carbohydrates are required energy sources. UPEC strains in urine  and  express transporters for peptides, amino acids, carbohydrates, and iron and genes associated with nitrogen limitation, amino acid synthesis, nucleotide synthesis, and nucleotide salvage. Mouse models confirm the requirement for many, but not all, of these genes. Laboratory evolution studies suggest that rapid nutrient uptake without metabolic rewiring is sufficient to account for rapid growth. Proteins and pathways required for rapid growth should be considered potential targets for alternate or adjunct therapies.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385363>Effect of metformin on myotube BCAA catabolism.</a></h2><p>Metformin has antihyperglycemic properties and is a commonly prescribed drug for type II diabetes mellitus. Metformin functions in part by activating 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase, reducing hepatic  and blood glucose. Metformin also upregulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). Several population studies have shown levels of circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) positively correlate with insulin resistance. Because BCAA catabolic enzyme content is regulated by PGC-1α, we hypothesized metformin may alter BCAA catabolism. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of metformin at varying concentrations on myotube metabolism and related gene and protein expression. C2C12 myotubes were treated with metformin at 30 uM (physiological) or 2 mM (supraphysiological) for up to 24 hours. Metabolic gene expression was measured via quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, protein expression was measured using Western blot, and mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolism were measured via oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rate, respectively. Supraphysiological metformin upregulated PGC-1α mRNA expression along with related downstream targets, yet the reduced expression of electron transport chain components as well as basal and peak cell metabolism. Supraphysiological metformin also suppressed branched-chain aminotransferase 2 (BCAT2) and branched-chain-alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase E1a (BCKDHa) mRNA expression as well as BCAT2 protein expression and BCKDHa activity, which was accompanied by decreased Kruppel-like factor 15 protein expression. Physiological levels of metformin suppressed BCKDHa and cytochrome c oxidase mRNA expression at early time points (4-12 hours) but had no effect on any other outcomes. Together these data suggest metformin may suppress BCAA catabolic enzyme expression or activity, possibly reducing levels of circulating gluconeogenic substrates.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609623>Gymnemic Acid Ameliorate Hyperglycemia Through PI3K/AKT and AMPK Mediated Signaling Pathway in T2DM Rats.</a></h2><p>Gymnemic acid (GA) isolated from gymnema sylvestre (Retz.) Schult has been shown to display anti-diabetic activity, however the molecular mechanisms governing these effects are unclear. In this study, GA (40, 80 mg/kg/day) was evaluated by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats to explore its hypoglycemic activity and underlying mechanisms of action. The results indicated that GA decreased fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentrations by 26.7 %, and lowered insulin concentrations by 16.1 % after oral administration of GA at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks in T2DM rats. Our data showed that RT-PCR and Western blot analysis indicated that GA up-regulated the expression of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and glycogen synthesis (GS), promoted the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), while down-regulated the expression of glycogen synthesis kinase-3β (GSK-3β) in T2DM rats. In addition, key proteins involved in AMPK-mediated  (such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy kinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase)) were down-regulated in GA-treated T2DM rats. In summary, the hypoglycemic mechanisms of GA may be related to promoting insulin signal transduction and activating PI3K/Akt and AMPK-mediated signaling pathway in T2DM rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31133647>Activation of the unfolded protein response in high glucose treated endothelial cells is mediated by methylglyoxal.</a></h2><p>Metabolic dysfunction of endothelial cells in hyperglycemia contributes to the development of vascular complications of diabetes where increased reactive glycating agent, methylglyoxal (MG), is involved. We assessed if increased MG glycation induced proteotoxic stress, identifying related metabolic drivers and protein targets. Human aortal endothelial cells (HAECs) were incubated in high glucose concentration (20 mM versus 5 mM control) in vitro for 3-6 days. Flux of glucose metabolism, MG formation and glycation and changes in cytosolic protein abundances, MG modification and proteotoxic responses were assessed. Similar studies were performed with human microvascular endothelial HMEC-1 cells where similar outcomes were observed. HAECs exposed to high glucose concentration showed increased cellular concentration of MG (2.27 ± 0.21 versus 1.28 ± 0.03 pmol/10 cells, P < 0.01) and formation of MG-modified proteins (24.0 ± 3.7 versus 14.1 ± 3.2 pmol/10 cells/day; P < 0.001). In proteomics analysis, high glucose concentration increased proteins of the heat shock response - indicating activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) with downstream inflammatory and pro-thrombotic responses. Proteins susceptible to MG modification were enriched in protein folding, protein synthesis, serine/threonine kinase signalling, glycolysis and . MG was increased in high glucose by increased flux of MG formation linked to increased glucose metabolism mediated by proteolytic stabilisation and increase of hexokinase-2 (HK-2); later potentiated by proteolytic down regulation of glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) - the major enzyme of MG metabolism. Silencing of Glo1, selectively increasing MG, activated the UPR similarly. Silencing of HK-2 prevented increased glucose metabolism and MG formation. trans-Resveratrol and hesperetin combination (tRES-HESP) corrected increased MG and glucose metabolism by increasing expression of Glo1 and decreasing expression of HK-2. Increased MG glycation activates the UPR in endothelial cells and thereby may contribute to endothelial cell dysfunction in diabetic vascular disease where tRES-HESP may provide effective therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31444412>Decreased FBP1 expression rewires metabolic processes affecting aggressiveness of glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>Radiotherapy is a standard treatment option for patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Although it has high therapeutic efficacy, some proportion of the tumor cells that survive after radiotherapy may cause side effects. In this study, we found that fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1), a rate-limiting enzyme in , was downregulated upon treatment with ionizing radiation (IR). Ets1, which was found to be overexpressed in IR-induced infiltrating GBM, was suggested to be a transcriptional repressor of FBP1. Furthermore, glucose uptake and extracellular acidification rates were increased upon FBP1 downregulation, which indicated an elevated glycolysis level. We found that emodin, an inhibitor of phosphoglycerate mutase 1 derived from natural substances, significantly suppressed the glycolysis rate and IR-induced GBM migration in in vivo orthotopic xenograft mouse models. We propose that the reduced FBP1 level reprogrammed the metabolic state of GBM cells, and thus, FBP1 is a potential therapeutic target regulating GBM metabolism following radiotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31329314>Ventromedial hypothalamus glucose-inhibited neurones: A role in glucose and energy homeostasis?</a></h2><p>The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) plays a complex role in glucose and energy homeostasis. The VMH is necessary for the counter-regulatory response to hypoglycaemia (CRR) that increases hepatic  to restore euglycaemia. On the other hand, the VMH also restrains hepatic glucose production during euglycaemia and stimulates peripheral glucose uptake. The VMH is also important for the ability of oestrogen to increase energy expenditure. This latter function is mediated by VMH modulation of the lateral/perifornical hypothalamic area (lateral/perifornical hypothalamus) orexin neurones. Activation of VMH AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is necessary for the CRR. By contrast, VMH AMPK inhibition favours decreased basal glucose levels and is required for oestrogen to increase energy expenditure. Specialised VMH glucose-sensing neurones confer the ability to sense and respond to changes in blood glucose levels. Glucose-excited (GE) neurones increase and glucose-inhibited (GI) neurones decrease their activity as glucose levels rise. VMH GI neurones, in particular, appear to be important in the CRR, although a role for GE neurones cannot be discounted. AMPK mediates glucose sensing in VMH GI neurones suggesting that, although activation of these neurones is important for the CRR, it is necessary to silence them to lower basal glucose levels and enable oestrogen to increase energy expenditure. In support of this, we found that oestrogen reduces activation of VMH GI neurones in low glucose by inhibiting AMPK. In this review, we present the evidence underlying the role of the VMH in glucose and energy homeostasis. We then discuss the role of VMH glucose-sensing neurones in mediating these effects, with a strong emphasis on oestrogenic regulation of glucose sensing and how this may affect glucose and energy homeostasis.© 2019 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160974>Therapeutic effects of ethanolic extract from the green cocoon shell of silkworm  on type 2 diabetic mice and its hypoglycaemic mechanism.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus is a clinically complex disease characterized by hyperglycaemia with disturbances in carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. The aim of this study was to determine the therapeutic effect of ethanolic extract (EE) from the green cocoon sericin layer of silkworm  on mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its hypoglycaemic mechanisms. The results showed that oral EE for 7 weeks had significant ameliorative effects on all the biochemical parameters studied . The levels of oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance were significantly improved. The hypoglycaemic rate in the 350 mg kg high dosage group was 39.38%. The levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the high dosage EE-treated group were significantly reduced, while activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were obviously increased. The islet area and the number of insulin-positive beta cells increased significantly in the high dose group. Furthermore, expression levels of insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate (IRS), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p-Akt and phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (p-GSK3β) involved in insulin signalling were increased. Adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) also were activated to regulate glucose metabolism in EE-treated groups. The levels of glucose 6-phosphatase (G6pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) decreased, while the glucokinase (GK) level increased to promote glycolysis. The results clearly indicated that oral EE, especially at a high dose, could improve the glucose metabolism of T2DM by reducing inflammatory reactions, enhancing the antioxidant capacity and insulin sensitivity, and regulating the balance between glycolysis and , which means that EE has potential ameliorative effects on T2DM mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613531>Biotin Deficiency.</a></h2><p>Biotin (vitamin H or vitamin B7) is a B-complex vitamin that acts as an essential coenzyme for five carboxylases: pyruvate carboxylase, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, and coenzyme for acetyl-CoA carboxylases 1 and 2.[1][2][3][4] These carboxylases help in several chemical processes in the cell, including , amino acid metabolism, and fatty acid synthesis.[1][3] The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine recommends a daily dietary intake of 30 mcg/day, for the maintenance of good health.

Here, we assessed LAN-induced effects on behaviour and physiology, and examined molecular changes in the liver of diurnal zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Birds were exposed to dim LAN (dLAN: 12L = 150 lux: 12D = 5 lux), with controls on 12L (150 lux): 12D (0 lux). dLAN altered daily activity-rest and eating patterns, induced nocturnal eating and caused body fattening and weight gain, and reduced nocturnal melatonin levels. Concomitant increased nighttime glucose levels, decreased daytime thyroxine and triglycerides levels, and hepatic lipid accumulation suggested the impairment of metabolism under dLAN. Transcriptional assays evidenced dLAN-induced negative effects on metabolism in the liver, the site of metabolic homeostasis. Particularly, increased g6pc and foxo1 mRNA expressions suggested an enhanced , while increased egr1 and star expressions suggested enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid metabolism, respectively. Similarly, overexpressed sirt1 indicated protection from the metabolic damage due to elevated  and cholesterol biosynthesis under dLAN. However, no effect on genes involved in lipogenesis (fasn) and insulin signalling pathway (socs3 and insig1) might indicate for the post transcriptional/post translational modification effects or the involvement of other genetic pathways in LAN-induced effects. We also found daily rhythm in the hepatic expression of selected clock and clock-controlled genes (per2, bmal1 and reverb-beta), with an elevated mesor and amplitude of per2 oscillation, suggesting a role of per2 in the liver metabolism.

CKD patients fail to increase insulin secretion in response to insulin resistance because of acidosis, 1,25 vitamin D deficiency, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Hemodialysis causes further fluctuations in glycemic control due to alterations in insulin secretion, clearance and resistance. DKA is uncommon in hemodialysis patients because of the absence of glycosuria and osmotic diuresis which accounts for most of the fluid and electrolyte losses seen in DKA, anuric patients may be somewhat protected from dehydration and shock, although still subject to hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. However, substantial volume loss can still occur due to a prolonged decrease in oral intake or increased insensible water losses related to tachypnoea and fever. There is no current guidelines for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in anuric hemodialysis patients considering their differences than general population.

Thus, identification of physiologically-relevant CAR modulators has garnered significant interest. Here, we adapted the previously characterized human CAR (hCAR) nuclear translocation assay in human primary hepatocytes (HPH) to a high-content format and screened an FDA-approved drug library containing 978 compounds. Comparison of hCAR nuclear translocation results with the Tox21 hCAR luciferase reporter assay database in 643 shared compounds revealed significant overlap between these two assays, with approximately half of hCAR agonists also mediating nuclear translocation. Further validation of these compounds in HPH and/or using published data from literature demonstrated that hCAR translocation exhibits a higher correlation with the induction of hCAR target genes, such as CYP2B6, than the luciferase assay. In addition, some CAR antagonists which repress CYP2B6 mRNA expression in HPH, such as sorafenib, rimonabant, and CINPA1, were found to translocate hCAR to the nucleus of HPH. Notably, both the translocation assay and the luciferase assay identified mosapride citrate (MOS), a gastroprokinetic agent that is known to reduce fasting blood glucose levels in humans, as a novel hCAR activator. Further studies with MOS in HPH uncovered that MOS can repress the expression of gluconeogenic genes and decrease glucose output from hepatocytes, providing a previously unidentified liver-specific mechanism by which MOS modulates blood glucose levels.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although metabolic adaptations of the adipose tissue are critical for a successful transition, beyond lipolysis, alterations within adipose tissue during ketosis are not well known. The objective of this study was to investigate the adipose tissue proteome of healthy or ketotic postpartum cows to gain insights into biological adaptations that may contribute to disease outcomes. Adipose tissue biopsy was collected on 5 healthy and 5 ketotic cows at 17 (±4) d postpartum and ketosis was defined according to the clinical symptoms and serum β-hydroxybutyrate concentration. Morphology micrographs stained by hematoxylin-eosin showed that adipocytes were smaller in ketotic cows than in healthy cows. The isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification was applied to quantitatively identify differentially expressed proteins (DEP) in the adipose tissue. We identified a total of 924 proteins, 81 of which were differentially expressed between ketotic and healthy cows (P < 0.05 and fold changes >1.5 or <0.67). These DEP included enzymes and proteins associated with various carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism processes. The top pathways differing between ketosis and control cows were glycolysis/, glucagon signaling pathway, cysteine and methionine metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, and the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. The identified DEP were further validated by western blot and co-immunoprecipitation assay. Key enzymes associated with carbohydrate metabolism such as pyruvate kinase 2, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit α), lactate dehydrogenase A , phosphoglucomutase 1, and 6-phosphofructokinase 1 were upregulated in ketotic cows. The expression and phosphorylation state of critical regulators of lipolysis such as perilipin-1 and hormone-sensitive lipase were also upregulated in ketotic cows. Furthermore, key proteins involved in maintaining innate immune response such as lipopolysaccharide binding protein and regakine-1 were downregulated in ketotic cows. Overall, data indicate that ketotic cows during the transition period have altered carbohydrate, lipid metabolism, and impaired immune function in the adipose tissue. This proteomics analysis in adipose tissue of ketotic cows identified several pathways and proteins that are components of the adaptation to ketosis.© The Author(s) 2019.

TMS did not change or down-regulate genes involved in liver proliferation or apoptosis such as Mki67, Foxm1, Myc, Mcl1, Pcna, Bcl2, or Mdm2, which were up-regulated by another Car ligand TCPOBOP. TMS did not increase liver weight and had no significant effect on Ki67 and Pcna labeling indices in mouse liver in vivo. In murine hepatic AML12 cells, we confirmed a Car-independent proapoptotic effect of TMS.

One example is the response of cells to glucose. In S. cerevisiae growing in glucose-depleted medium, the re-availability of glucose leads to the downregulation of gluconeogenesis, and the activation of , leading to 'glucose repression'. However, our knowledge of the mechanisms mediating the glucose dependent downregulation of the gluconeogenic transcription factors is limited. Using a major gluconeogenic transcription factor Rds2 as a candidate, here we identify a novel role for the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pib1 in regulating the stability and degradation of Rds2. Glucose addition to cells growing in glucose limitation results in rapid ubiquitination of Rds2, followed by its proteasomal degradation. Through in vivo and in vitro experiments, we establish Pib1 as the ubiquitin E3 ligase that regulates Rds2 ubiquitination and stability. Notably, this Pib1 mediated Rds2 ubiquitination, followed by proteasomal degradation, is specific to the presence of glucose. This Pib1 mediated ubiquitination of Rds2 depends on the phosphorylation state of Rds2, suggesting a cross-talk between ubiquitination and phosphorylation to achieve a metabolic state change. Using stable-isotope based metabolic flux experiments we find that the loss of Pib1 results in an imbalanced gluconeogenic state, regardless of glucose availability. Pib1 is required for complete glucose repression, and enables cells to optimally grow in competitive environments when glucose becomes re-available. Our results reveal the existence of a Pib1 mediated regulatory program that mediates glucose-repression when glucose availability is restored.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31240717>Maternal resveratrol administration protects against gestational diabetes-induced glucose intolerance and islet dysfunction in the rat offspring.</a></h2><p>Maternal resveratrol (RESV) administration in gestational diabetes (GDM) restored normoglycaemia and insulin secretion.

In the third trimester, when maternal hyperglycaemia was observed, the HFS diet was supplemented with RESV. At weaning, offspring were randomly assigned a LF or HFS diet until 15 weeks of age. In pregnant dams, RESV restored glucose tolerance, normoglycaemia and improved insulin secretion. At 15 weeks of age, GDM+RESV-HFS male offspring were less obese than the GDM-HFS offspring. By contrast, the female GDM+RESV-HFS offspring were similarly as obese as the GDM-HFS group. Hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and dysregulated  were observed in the male GDM offspring and were attenuated in the offspring of GDM+RESV dams. The dysregulation of several metabolic genes (e.g. ppara, lpl, pepck and g6p) in the livers of GDM offspring was attenuated in the GDM+RESV offspring group. Glucose stimulated insulin secretion was also improved in the islets from offspring of GDM+RESV dams. Thus, maternal RESV supplementation during the third trimester of pregnancy and lactation induced several beneficial metabolic health outcomes for both mothers and offspring. Therefore, RESV could be an alternative to current GDM treatments.© 2019 The Authors.

Herein, comparative metabolomics was adopted to analyze the variations in the hemolymph metabolites of different resistant silkworm strains following BmNPV inoculation using a H NMR method. Trehalose, as an instant source of energy, plays a crucial role in the response to pathogen infections in insects. The level of trehalose was persistently upregulated in the hemolymph of the resistant silkworm strain YeA following infection with BmNPV, compared to that of the susceptible strain YeB, indicating that trehalose metabolism plays a vital role in the response to BmNPV infection. The significant upregulation of TCA cycle relevant metabolites, including malate, fumarate, citrate, succinate, and α-ketoglutarate, was identified at 0 h, 12 h, 48 h, and 96 h post-infection in YeA hemolymph, whereas a significant upregulation in YeB hemolymph was only detected at an early stage of infection (0 h-24 h). The expression level of selected key metabolic enzymes, determined using RT-qPCR, validated the differences in trehalose and TCA cycle relevant metabolite levels. The variations in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) pathway relevant metabolites in resistant silkworm strains following BmNPV infection showed a regular undulation at different times after infection. A significant accumulation of phenylalanine and tyrosine was observed in YeA following BmNPV infection compared to YeB. The glycolysis and  pathways showed a relatively low activity in YeA following BmNPV infection. Moreover, the levels of other metabolites related to fat metabolism, transamination, energy metabolism, and glycometabolism, such as glycine, threonine, glutamine, and glutamate, were unstable in the two silkworm strains following BmNPV infection. Thus, our study provides an overview of the metabolic response of the silkworm in response to BmNPV infection, which lays the foundation for clarifying the mechanism of silkworm resistance to BmNPV infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, only a minor fraction of sRNAs is well characterized with respect to the spectra of their targets, conditional expression profiles and actual mechanisms they use to regulate gene expression to control particular biological pathways. To learn more about the specific contribution of sRNAs to the global regulatory network controlling the Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism (CCM), we employed microarray analysis and compared transcriptome profiles of E. coli cells grown on two alternative minimal media supplemented with either pyruvate or glucose, respectively. Microarray analysis revealed that utilization of these alternative carbon sources led to profound differences in gene expression affecting all major gene clusters associated with CCM as well as expression of several known (CyaR, RyhB, GcvB and RyeA) and putative (C0652) sRNAs. To assess the impact of transcriptional reprogramming of gene expression on E. coli protein abundance, we also employed two-dimensional protein gel electrophoresis. Our experimental data made it possible to determine the major pathways for pyruvate assimilation when it is used as a sole carbon source and reveal the impact of other key processes (i.e., energy production, molecular transport and cell resistance to stress) associated with the CCM in E. coli. Moreover, some of these processes were apparently controlled by GcvB, RyhB and CyaR at the post-transcriptional level, thus indicating the complexity and interconnection of the regulatory networks that control CCM in bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615494>Increment of plasma glucose by exogenous glucagon is associated with present and future renal function in type 2 diabetes:a retrospective study from glucagon stimulation test.</a></h2><p>Glucagon stimulation test (GST) is often employed to assess the insulin reserve of the pancreatic beta cells in diabetic subjects. The clinical significance of the increment of plasma glucose (Δglucose) by exogenous glucagon during GST has not been elucidated. We investigated the relationship between Δglucose and clinical parameters including the liver and renal function in type 2 diabetic subjects, since we hypothesized that Δglucose is associated with the liver and renal function reflecting the capacity for  in the organs.A total of 209 subjects with type 2 diabetes who underwent GST during admission were included in this cross-sectional study. We defined the difference between plasma glucose at fasting and 6 min after intravenous injection of 1 mg glucagon as Δglucose. We assessed correlations between Δglucose and clinical parameters such as diabetic duration, BMI, HbA1c, beta cell function, serum free fatty acids (FFA) which is known to stimulate , liver function, the indices of liver function, renal function, and urinary albumin excretion (UAE).In correlation analysis, Δglucose positively correlated to FFA and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), but inversely to serum creatinine and cystatin C, although Δglucose showed no correlation with both liver function and the indices of residual liver function. Multiple regression analysis revealed that Δglucose was an independent determinant for the eGFR after 1 year, equally BMI, HbA1c, serum lipids, and UAE, which are known as the predictors for the development of chronic kidney disease.Our results suggest that Δglucose during GST might be related to  in the kidney and could be the determinant of future renal function in type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450038>Effect of gradual temperature increase on the carbohydrate energy metabolism responses of the Antarctic fish Notothenia rossii.</a></h2><p>The warming of the Southern Ocean waters may affect the biological processes and the performance of the fish inhabiting it. The notothenioid group is metabolically specialized to low-temperature environments and may be vulnerable to the climatic changes imposed on the Antarctic continent. However, gradual temperature changes potentially allow an opportunity for plasticity adjustments. The present study evaluated the effect of gradual increase of temperature on the enzymatic and nonenzymatic parameters of energy metabolism in renal, branchial, hepatic, and encephalic tissue of Notothenia rossii subjected to a gradual temperature change of 0.5 °C/day until reaching 2 °C, 4 °C, 6 °C, and 8 °C. Under the effect of an acclimation rate of 0.5 °C/day, the gill tissue showed increased phosphofructokinase (PFK) enzyme activity. In the kidney, there was increased activity of the malate dehydrogenase (MDH), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PDH), and glycogen phosphorylase (GP) enzymes. There was an increase in lactate concentration in the liver and an increase in GP enzyme activity in the brain. The specific tissue responses indicate the presence of thermal plasticity and an attempt to regulate energy metabolism to mitigate thermal stress in this species under these experimental conditions, possibly through the activation of glycolysis, , and glycogenolysis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It is a ubiquitous source of energy for every organism in the world and is essential to fuel both aerobic and anaerobic cellular respiration. Glucose often enters the body in isometric forms such as galactose and fructose (monosaccharides), lactose and sucrose (disaccharides), or starch (polysaccharide). Our body stores excess glucose as glycogen (a polymer of glucose) which become liberated in times of fasting. Glucose is also derivable from products of fat and protein break-down through the process of . Considering how vital glucose is for homeostasis, it is no surprise that there are a plethora of sources for it.  Once glucose is in the body, it travels through the blood and to energy-requiring tissues. There, glucose is broken down in a series of biochemical reactions releasing energy in the form of ATP. The ATP derived from these processes is used to fuel virtually every energy-requiring process in the body. In eukaryotes, most energy derives from aerobic (oxygen-requiring) processes which start with a molecule of glucose. The glucose is broken down first through the anaerobic process of glycolysis, leading to the production of some ATP and pyruvate end-product. In anaerobic conditions, pyruvate converts to lactate through reduction. In aerobic conditions, the pyruvate can enter the citric acid cycle to yield energy-rich electron carriers which help produce ATP at the electron transport chain (ETC).[1]Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31233505>Adenovirus-mediated expression of SIK1 improves hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetes mellitus rats.</a></h2><p>In this study, we investigated the role and mechanism of Salt-induced kinase 1 (SIK1) in regulation of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in a high-fat food (HFD) and streptozocin (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rat model.A diabetic rat model treated with HFD plus low-dose STZ was developed and was transduced to induce a high expression of SIK1 in vivo via a tail-vein injection of a recombinant adenoviral vector. The effects on hepatic glucogenetic and lipogenic gene expression, systemic metabolism and pathological changes were then determined.In T2DM rats, SIK1 expression was reduced in the liver. Overexpression of SIK1 improved hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia and fatty liver, reduced the expression of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription co-activator 2 (CRTC2), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), pS577 SIK1, sterol regulatory element binding-protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and its target genes, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), and increased the expression of SIK1, pT182 SIK1 and pS171 CRTC2 in diabetic rat livers with the suppression of  and lipid deposition.SIK1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism in the livers of HFD/STZ-induced T2DM rats, where it suppresses hepatic  and lipogenesis by regulating the SIK1/CRTC2 and SIK1/SREBP-1c signalling pathways.

Here, we fed breeder cocks five different diets containing 0, 0.25, 1.25, 2.50 and 5.00 mg kg folate throughout life. Paternal folate supplementation (FS) was beneficial to the growth and organ development of broiler offspring. Most importantly, the lipid and glucose metabolism of breeder cocks and broiler offspring were affected by paternal FS, according to biochemical and metabolomic analyses. We further employed global analyses of hepatic and spermatozoal messenger RNA (mRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and micro RNA (miRNA). Some key genes involved in the glycolysis or  pathway and the PPAR signalling pathway, including ,  and , were regulated by differentially expressed hepatic and spermatozoal miRNAs and lncRNAs in breeder cocks and broiler offspring. Moreover, the expression of  could also be regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs and lncRNAs in spermatozoa via competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanisms. Overall, this model suggests that paternal folate could transgenerationally regulate lipid and glucose metabolism in broiler offspring and the epigenetic transmission may involve altered spermatozoal miRNAs and lncRNAs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672551>Fasting reveals largely intact systemic lipid mobilization mechanisms in respiratory chain complex III deficient mice.</a></h2><p>Mice homozygous for the human GRACILE syndrome mutation (Bcs1l) display decreased respiratory chain complex III activity, liver dysfunction, hypoglycemia, rapid loss of white adipose tissue and early death. To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free fatty acids (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the liver and utilization for fuel or  in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte mitochondria were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major metabolic controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like metabolic condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction. SUMMARY STATEMENT: Bcs1l mutant mice with severe CIII deficiency, energy deprivation and post-weaning lipolysis respond to fasting similarly to wild-type mice, suggesting largely normal systemic lipid mobilization and utilization mechanisms.Copyright © 2019.

Variation in bull fertility has been demonstrated even among those animals exhibiting normal sperm numbers, motility, and morphology. Despite advances in research, molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the causes of low fertility in some bulls have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the metabolic profile of bull spermatozoa using non-targeted metabolomics. Statistical analysis and bioinformatic tools were employed to evaluate the metabolic profiles high and low fertility groups. Metabolic pathways associated with the sperm metabolome were also reported.A total of 22 distinct metabolites were detected in spermatozoa from bulls with high fertility (HF) or low fertility (LF) phenotype. The major metabolite classes of bovine sperm were organic acids/derivatives and fatty acids/conjugates. We demonstrated that the abundance ratios of five sperm metabolites were statistically different between HF and LF groups including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), carbamate, benzoic acid, lactic acid, and palmitic acid. Metabolites with different abundances in HF and LF bulls had also VIP scores of greater than 1.5 and AUC- ROC curves of more than 80%. In addition, four metabolic pathways associated with differential metabolites namely alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, β-alanine metabolism, glycolysis or , and pyruvate metabolism were also explored.This is the first study aimed at ascertaining the metabolome of spermatozoa from bulls with different fertility phenotype using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We identified five metabolites in the two groups of sires and such molecules can be used, in the future, as key indicators of bull fertility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31473580>Baicalin ameliorates hepatic insulin resistance and gluconeogenic activity through inhibition of p38 MAPK/PGC-1α pathway.</a></h2><p>Although the results of our and other studies show that baicalin can enhance glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and adipocytes of mice, the specific metabolic contribution of baicalin on hepatic insulin resistance and gluconeogenic activity is still unclear.The aim of this study is to investigate whether baicalin is involved in regulation of hepatic insulin resistance and gluconeogenic activity and its underlying mechanisms.In the present study, high-fat diet-induced obese mice were given 50 mg/kg baicalin intraperitoneally (i.p.) once a day for 21 consecutive days, and hepatocytes were treated with baicalin (100 μM) or metformin (100 μM) in the presence of glucagon (200 nM) for 12 h. Then insulin resistance indexes and genes related to  were examined in liver tissues.The present findings showed that baicalin decreased body weight, HOMA-IR, and alleviated high fat diet-induced glucose intolerance, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in diet-induced obese mice. Furthermore, baicalin markedly suppressed p-p38 MAPK, p-CREB, FoxO1, PGC-1α, PEPCK and G6Pase expression in liver of obese mice and hepatocytes. Moreover, inhibition of gluconeogenic genes by baicalin was also strengthened by p38MAPK inhibitor in hepatocytes.Baicalin suppressed expression of PGC-1α and gluconeogenic genes, and reduced glucose production in high-fat diet-induced obese mice. Baicalin ameliorated hepatic insulin resistance and gluconeogenic activity mainly through inhibition of p38 MAPK/PGC-1α signal pathway. This study provides a possibility of using baicalin to treat hyperglycemia and hepatic insulin resistance in clinic.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Thus, microbes provide valuable ecosystem services in terms of biodegradation and bioindicators of compromised habitats. From a remediation perspective it is valuable to leverage the suite of microbial genes at the transcriptional level that are active in either natural versus stressed environments to provide insight into the cycling and fate of contaminants. Metatranscriptomic analysis of total bacterial and archaeal messenger RNA (mRNA) is a useful tool in this facet and was applied to sediments sampled from the Detroit River; a binational Area of Concern (AOC) in the Great Lakes. Previously established sediment surveys and modelling delineated the river into contaminant gradients based on concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and metals. Differential expression analysis through DESeq2 revealed that microbial transcripts associated with nitrate reduction, methanogenesis, and beta-oxidation were significant in legacy polluted sediments and linked with energetic pathways key in the generation of cellular currencies (acetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA).  and polyester synthesis also showed high abundance in contaminated regions, along with increased expression of stress response genes and transposons, despite decreases in community α-diversity. Aromatic cleavage genes were detected, but in low abundance across the contaminant gradient. These results suggest that microbial communities within the Detroit River exploit unique anabolic and catabolic pathways to derive and store energy from legacy organic contaminants while simultaneously recruiting stress-response and gene transfer mechanisms to cope with xenobiotic pressures.

We explored the mechanisms underlying this variability.PubMed was searched for articles in English from 1960 to 2018 for advanced CKD and diabetes, glucose and insulin metabolism, insulin clearance, secretion and resistance, plasma insulin concentration, glycemic control, hypoglycemia, insulin dosage, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in CKD.The evidence shows that in most patients the daily dose of insulin needs to be significantly reduced with a high degree of variability; in some the dose remains unchanged, and rarely it is increased. The premise that the marked reduction in insulin requirement is essentially attributable to decreased insulin clearance by kidneys leading to prolongation of its plasma half-life, elevated blood insulin concentration, and hypoglycemia is not entirely correct. Other factors including decreases in food intake, insulin secretion, insulin clearance by peripheral tissues, and renal  play important roles. There is also heightened resistance to insulin due to metabolic acidosis, uremic toxins, inflammatory state, and vitamin D deficiency. Importantly, the magnitude of changes in each of these factors varies between individuals with the same degree of CKD.In the presence of diabetes with advanced CKD, the insulin regimen should be individualized based on knowledge of the daily glucose patterns. The use of CGM is promising for safer glycemic control in patients with advanced CKD and diabetes and helps prevent extremes of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314546>Increased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in skeletal muscle of growth-restricted ovine fetuses.</a></h2><p>Fetal sheep with placental insufficiency-induced intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) have lower fractional rates of glucose oxidation and greater , indicating lactate shuttling between skeletal muscle and liver. Suppression of pyruvate dehydrogenase () activity was proposed because of greater pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 4 and PDK1 mRNA concentrations in IUGR muscle. Although PDK1 and PDK4 inhibit PDH activity to reduce pyruvate metabolism, PDH protein concentrations and activity have not been examined in skeletal muscle from IUGR fetuses. Therefore, we evaluated the protein concentrations and activity of PDH and the kinases and phosphatases that regulate PDH phosphorylation status in the semitendinosus muscle from placenta insufficiency-induced IUGR sheep fetuses and control fetuses. Immunoblots were performed for PDH, phosphorylated PDH (E1α), PDK1, PDK4, and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 and 2 (PDP1 and PDP2, respectively). Additionally, the PDH, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and citrate synthase (CS) enzymatic activities were measured. Phosphorylated PDH concentrations were 28% lower (P < 0.01) and PDH activity was 67% greater (P < 0.01) in IUGR fetal muscle compared with control. PDK1, PDK4, PDP1, PDP2, and PDH concentrations were not different between groups. CS and LDH activities were also unaffected. Contrary to the previous speculation, PDH activity was greater in skeletal muscle from IUGR fetuses, which parallels lower phosphorylated PDH. Therefore, greater expression of PDK1 and PDK4 mRNA did not translate to greater PDK1 or PDK4 protein concentrations or inhibition of PDH as proposed. Instead, these findings show greater PDH activity in IUGR fetal muscle, which indicates that alternative regulatory mechanisms are responsible for lower pyruvate catabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285263> stabilization of OPA1 in hepatocytes potentiates mitochondrial respiration and  in a prohibitin-dependent way.</a></h2><p>Patients with fatty liver diseases present altered mitochondrial morphology and impaired metabolic function. Mitochondrial dynamics and related cell function require the uncleaved form of the dynamin-like GTPase OPA1. Stabilization of OPA1 might then confer a protective mechanism against stress-induced tissue damages. To study the putative role of hepatic mitochondrial morphology in a sick liver, we expressed a cleavage-resistant long form of OPA1 (L-OPA1Δ) in the liver of a mouse model with mitochondrial liver dysfunction ( the hepatocyte-specific prohibitin-2 knockout (Hep-Phb2) mice). Liver prohibitin-2 deficiency caused excessive proteolytic cleavage of L-OPA1, mitochondrial fragmentation, and increased apoptosis. These molecular alterations were associated with lipid accumulation, abolished , and extensive liver damage. Such liver dysfunction was associated with severe hypoglycemia. In prohibitin-2 knockout mice, expression of L-OPA1Δ by  adenovirus delivery restored the morphology but not the function of mitochondria in hepatocytes. In prohibitin-competent mice, elongation of liver mitochondria by expression of L-OPA1Δ resulted in excessive glucose production associated with increased mitochondrial respiration. In conclusion, mitochondrial dynamics participates in the control of hepatic glucose production.© 2019 Li et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501489>Comparative adipose transcriptome analysis digs out genes related to fat deposition in two pig breeds.</a></h2><p>Fatness traits are important in pigs because of their implications for fattening efficiency, meat quality, reproductive performance and immunity. Songliao black pigs and Landrace pigs show important differences in production and meat quality traits, including fatness and muscle growth. Therefore, we used a high-throughput massively parallel RNA-seq approach to identify genes differentially expressed in backfat tissue between these two breeds (six pigs in each). An average of 37.87 million reads were obtained from the 12 samples. After statistical analysis of gene expression data by edgeR, a total of 877 differentially expressed genes were detected between the two pig breeds, 205 with higher expression and 672 with lower expression in Songliao pigs. Candidate genes (LCN2, CES3, DGKB, OLR1, LEP, PGM1, PCK1, ACACB, FADS1, FADS2, MOGAT2, SREBF1, PPARGC1B) with known effects on fatness traits were included among the DEGs. A total of 1071 lncRNAs were identified, and 85 of these lncRNAs were differentially expressed, including 53 up-regulated and 32 down-regulated lncRNAs, respectively. The differentially expressed genes and lncRNAs involved in glucagon signaling pathway, glycolysis/, insulin signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway and so on.

Here, we induced chronic low-grade ER stress in lean mice to levels similar to those in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice and found that it promoted hyperglycemia due to enhanced hepatic . Mechanistically, sustained ER stress up-regulated the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14 (USP14), which increased the stability and levels of 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-responsive element binding (CREB) protein (CBP) to enhance glucagon action and hepatic . Exogenous overexpression of USP14 in the liver significantly increased hepatic glucose output. Consistent with this, liver-specific knockdown of USP14 abrogated the effects of ER stress on glucose metabolism, and also improved hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance in obese mice. In conclusion, our findings show a mechanism underlying ER stress-induced disruption of glucose homeostasis, and present USP14 as a potential therapeutic target against T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31527117>Coxiella burnetii utilizes both glutamate and glucose during infection with glucose uptake mediated by multiple transporters.</a></h2><p>Coxiella burnetii is a Gram-negative bacterium which causes Q fever, a complex and life-threatening infection with both acute and chronic presentations. C. burnetii invades a variety of host cell types and replicates within a unique vacuole derived from the host cell lysosome. In order to understand how C. burnetii survives within this intracellular niche, we have investigated the carbon metabolism of both intracellular and axenically cultivated bacteria. Both bacterial populations were shown to assimilate exogenous [13C]glucose or [13C]glutamate, with concomitant labeling of intermediates in glycolysis and , and in the TCA cycle. Significantly, the two populations displayed metabolic pathway profiles reflective of the nutrient availabilities within their propagated environments. Disruption of the C. burnetii glucose transporter, CBU0265, by transposon mutagenesis led to a significant decrease in [13C]glucose utilization but did not abolish glucose usage, suggesting that C. burnetii express additional hexose transporters which may be able to compensate for the loss of CBU0265. This was supported by intracellular infection of human cells and in vivo studies in the insect model showing loss of CBU0265 had no impact on intracellular replication or virulence. Using this mutagenesis and [13C]glucose labeling approach, we identified a second glucose transporter, CBU0347, the disruption of which also showed significant decreases in 13C-label incorporation but did not impact intracellular replication or virulence. Together, these analyses indicate that C. burnetii may use multiple carbon sources in vivo and exhibits greater metabolic flexibility than expected.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168839>Some Musings About Differential Energy Metabolism With Ketogenic Diets.</a></h2><p>Ketogenic states are of 3 major types: total starvation and those resulting from the consumption of semistarvation, ketogenic diets, and eucaloric ketogenic diets. All are characterized by little or no dietary carbohydrate, resulting in a fat-based metabolism with sustained ketonemia of varying degrees in each state. The latter 2 diets are clinically useful with important impacts on both aspects of the energy balance equation with increased satiety and less hunger on the intake side and probably increased energy expenditure on the output side; both may have important implications for the successful long-term management of obesity. Consideration of older research regarding the hormonal response to carbohydrate-free dieting and recent findings on hepatic glycogen status that occurs with sustained ketonemia support the likelihood that there are profound differences in 24-hour  rates between ketogenic diets and balanced diets containing substantial carbohydrate. This metabolic distinction could have a meaningful impact to increase the thermic effect of feeding and daily energy expenditure amounting to 100 kcal/d or more with each of the ketogenic diets.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661273>Multi-organ systems study reveals Igfbp7 as a suppressor of  after gastric bypass surgery.</a></h2><p>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery reduces weight in obese patients. A marked decrease in blood glucose levels occurs before weight loss; however, key molecules that improve glycemic profile remain largely unknown. Using a murine RYGB surgery model, we performed multi-organ proteomics and bioinformatics to monitor the proteins and molecular pathways that change in this early glycemic response. Multiplexed proteomic kinetics data analysis revealed that the Roux limb, biliopancreatic limb, liver and pancreas each exhibited unique temporal and molecular responses to the RYGB surgery. In addition, protein-protein network analysis indicated that the changes to the microbial environment in the intestine may play a crucial role in the beneficial effects of RYGB surgery. Furthermore, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (Igfbp7) was identified as an early induced protein in the Roux limb. Known secretory properties of Igfbp7 prompted us to further investigate its role as a remote organ regulator of glucose metabolism. Igfbp7 overexpression decreased blood glucose levels in diet-induced obese mice, and attenuated gluconeogenic gene expression in the liver. Secreted Igfbp7 appeared to mediate these beneficial effects. These results demonstrate that organs responded differentially to RYGB surgery, and indicate Igfbp7 may play an important role in improving blood glucose levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307473>Metabolomic signatures and microbial community profiling of depressive rat model induced by adrenocorticotrophic hormone.</a></h2><p>Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-treatment rat model has been utilized as a widely accepted model of treatment-resistant depression. Metabolomic signatures represent the pathophysiological phenotype of diseases. Recent studies in gut microbiota and metabolomics analysis revealed the dramatic role of microbiome in psychoneurological system diseases, but still, the mechanisms underlying gut microbiome-host interaction remain unclear.Male Wistar rats were s.c. injection of ACTH fragment 1-24 for 14 days to induce treatment-resistant depression. Depression-related behavioral tests, analysis of serum monoamine neurotransmitters and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis-related hormones were determined for assessment of ACTH-induced depression rat model. A gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometer based urinary metabolomic signatures integrated 16S rRNA sequence analysis based gut microbial profiling was performed, as well as Spearman's correlation coefficient analysis was used to manifest the covariation between the differential urinary metabolites and gut microbiota of genus level.Chronic injection of ACTH-induced depression-like phenotype (increased immobility time in forced swimming test and tail suspension test) was accompanied by peripheral serotonin down-regulation and HPA axis overactivation (ACTH and corticosterone up-regulation). Urinary metabolomics analysis indicated that pyruvic acid, L-threonine, mannitol, D-gluconic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, D-arabitol, myo-inositol and ascorbic acid levels were reduced in ACTH-treated rats' urine, while hippurate level was elevated. In addition, microbial community profiling revealed bacterial enrichment (e.g. Ruminococcus, Klebsiella) and reduction (e.g. Akkermansia, Lactobacillus) in the ACTH-induced depression rat model. Correlation analysis showed that Akkermansia and Lactobacillus were closely relevant to metabolites myo-inositol and hippurate, which were included in host inositol phosphate metabolism, and phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis.Depression rat model induced by ACTH is associated with disturbance of pyruvate metabolism, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, and glycolysis or , as well as changes in microbial community structure. Gut microbiota may participate in the mediation of systemic metabolomic changes in ACTH-induced depression model.

Besides muscle, the liver has an essential role in regulating glucose homeostasis. Previous studies have reported that treatment of diet-induced obese (DIO) male mice with adropin (the putative secreted domain) reduces fasting blood glucose independently of body weight changes, suggesting that adropin suppresses glucose production in the liver. Here, we explored the molecular mechanisms underlying adropin's effects on hepatic glucose metabolism in DIO mice. Male DIO B6 mice maintained on a high-fat diet received five intraperitoneal injections of adropin (450 nmol/kg/injection) over a 48-h period. We found that adropin enhances major intracellular signaling activities in the liver that are involved in insulin-mediated regulation of glucose homeostasis. Moreover, treatment with adropin alleviated endoplasmic reticulum stress responses and reduced activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase in the liver, explaining the enhanced activities of hepatic insulin signaling pathways observed with adropin treatment. Furthermore, adropin suppressed cAMP activated protein kinase A (PKA) activities, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of inositol trisphosphate receptor, which mediates endoplasmic reticulum calcium efflux, and of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, a key transcription factor in hepatic regulation of glucose metabolism. Adropin directly affected liver metabolism, decreasing glucose production and reducing PKA-mediated phosphorylation in primary mouse hepatocytes  Our findings indicate that major hepatic signaling pathways contribute to the improved glycemic control achieved with adropin treatment in situations of obesity.© 2019 Gao et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31400386>The metabolic regulator small heterodimer partner contributes to the glucose and lipid homeostasis abnormalities induced by hepatitis C virus infection.</a></h2><p>Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can predispose the host to metabolic abnormalities.

The protective effects of SHP against HCV-induced hepatic fibrosis have been reported. However, the exact mechanisms of its role on metabolism are largely unknown. We investigated the role of hepatic SHP in regulating glucose and lipid homeostasis, particularly in the metabolic stress response caused by HCV infection. and lipogenesis levels and SHP expression were measured in HCV-infected cells, as well as in liver samples from HCV-infected patients and persistently HCV-infected mice.We demonstrated that SHP is involved in  via the acetylation of the Forkhead box O (FoxO) family transcription factor FoxO1, which is mediated by histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9). Meanwhile, SHP regulates lipogenesis in the liver via suppressing the induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) expression by the SUMOylation of Liver X receptor α (LXRα) at the SREBP-1c promoter. In particular, SHP can be strongly reduced upon stimulation, such as by HCV infection. The SHP expression levels were decreased in the livers from the CHC patients and persistently HCV-infected mice, and a negative correlation was observed between the SHP expression levels and gluconeogenic or lipogenic activities, emphasizing the clinical relevance of these results.Our results suggest that SHP is involved in HCV-induced abnormal glucose and lipid homeostasis and that SHP could be a major target for therapeutic interventions targeting HCV-associated metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Metabolic surgery is the most effective treatment for selected patients with diabetes and/or obesity. When compared to intensive medical therapy and lifestyle intervention, metabolic surgery has shown superiority in achieving glycemic improvement, reducing number of medications and cardiovascular risk factors, which translates in long-term benefits on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms underlying diabetes improvement after metabolic surgery have not yet been clearly understood but englobe a complex interaction among improvements in beta cell function and insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, intestinal , changes in glucose utilization, and absorption by the gut and changes in the secretory pattern and morphology of adipose tissue. These are achieved through different mediators which include an enhancement in gut hormones release, especially, glucagon-like peptide 1, changes in bile acids circulation, gut microbiome, and glucose transporters expression. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive appraisal of what is known so far to better understand the mechanisms through which metabolic surgery improves glycemic control facilitating future research in the field.Copyright © 2019 Pérez-Pevida, Escalada, Miras and Frühbeck.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447783>Sex Dependent Dysregulation of Hepatic Glucose Production in Lean Type 2 Diabetic Rats.</a></h2><p>We have characterized a lean type 2 diabetic rat model by gestational low protein programming. We aimed to identify if the regulation of hepatic glucose production (HGP) via  and glycogenolysis is affected and if there are any sex differences. Fasting (6-7 months old) type 2 diabetic rats received HO followed by a primed constant rate infusion of [6,6-H] glucose. Blood samples were drawn during steady states after 4 h of fasting and following a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. HGP and the fraction of glucose derived from  under fasting and euglycemic states were measured from steady state glucose enrichments after the infusion of [6,6-H]glucose and HO tracers. Glycogenolysis was determined by calculating the difference between total HGP and  rates. Hepatic gene expression of enzymes involved in HGP were quantified using qPCR. HGP rates was similar during fasting in both groups and sexes. However, under simulated fed condition, HGP rate was suppressed in controls but not in type 2 diabetic rats. They also showed inefficient HGP suppression in a simulated fed state. Differential analysis showed that suppression of both  and glycogenolysis under simulated fed state was affected in these low protein programmed type 2 diabetic rats. These effects were greater in females when compared to males. Further, key genes involved in these processes like G6Pase, Pepck, pyruvate carboxylase, and glycogen phosphorylase in liver were dysregulated.

We investigated the phenotype of the TMEM127 tumor suppressor gene deficiency in vivo. Whole-body Tmem127 knockout mice have decreased adiposity and maintain insulin sensitivity, low hepatic fat deposition and peripheral glucose clearance after a high-fat diet. Liver-specific and adipose-specific Tmem127 deletion partially overlap global Tmem127 loss: liver Tmem127 promotes hepatic  and inhibits peripheral glucose uptake, while adipose Tmem127 downregulates adipogenesis and hepatic glucose production. mTORC2 is activated in TMEM127-deficient hepatocytes suggesting that it interacts with TMEM127 to control insulin sensitivity. Murine hepatic Tmem127 expression is increased in insulin-resistant states and is reversed by diet or the insulin sensitizer pioglitazone. Importantly, human liver TMEM127 expression correlates with steatohepatitis and insulin resistance. Our results suggest that besides tumor suppression activities, TMEM127 is a nutrient-sensing component of glucose/lipid homeostasis and may be a target in insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31133988>Role of Mitochondria in the Mechanism(s) of Action of Metformin.</a></h2><p>Metformin is a drug from the biguanide family that is used for decades as the first-line therapeutic choice for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Despite its worldwide democratization, owing to its clinical efficacy, high safety profile and cheap cost, the exact mechanism(s) of action of this anti-hyperglycemic molecule with pleiotropic properties still remains to be fully elucidated. The concept that metformin would exert some of its actions though modulation of the mitochondrial bioenergetics was initially forged in the 50s but undeniably revived at the beginning of the twenty-first century when it was shown to induce a weak but specific inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory-chain complex 1. Furthermore, metformin has been reported to reduce generation of reactive oxygen species at the complex 1 and to prevent mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that it can protect against oxidative stress-induced cell death. Nevertheless, despite some recent progress and the demonstration of its key role in the inhibition of hepatic , the exact nature of the mitochondrial interaction between the drug and the complex 1 is still poorly characterized. Recent studies reported that metformin may also have anti-neoplastic properties by inhibiting cancer cell growth and proliferation, at least partly through its mitochondrial action. As such, many trials are currently conducted for exploring the repositioning of metformin as a potential drug for cancer therapy.

Metformin is thought to exert its primary antidiabetic action through the suppression of hepatic glucose production. In addition, the discovery that metformin inhibits the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex 1 has placed energy metabolism and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) at the centre of its proposed mechanism of action. However, the role of AMPK has been challenged and might only account for indirect changes in hepatic insulin sensitivity. Various mechanisms involving alterations in cellular energy charge, AMP-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase or fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 and modulation of the cellular redox state through direct inhibition of mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase have been proposed for the acute inhibition of  by metformin. Emerging evidence suggests that metformin could improve obesity-induced meta-inflammation via direct and indirect effects on tissue-resident immune cells in metabolic organs (that is, adipose tissue, the gastrointestinal tract and the liver). Furthermore, the gastrointestinal tract also has a major role in metformin action through modulation of glucose-lowering hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 and the intestinal bile acid pool and alterations in gut microbiota composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263685>Featured Species-Specific Loops Are Found in the Crystal Structure of  Eno, a Cell Surface Adhesin From .</a></h2><p>Enolase is an evolutionarily conserved enzyme involved in the processes of glycolysis and .  belongs to , whose species are wall-less and among the smallest self-replicating bacteria, and is an important colonizing respiratory pathogen in the pig industry worldwide.  enolase ( Eno) expression is significantly increased after infection and was previously found to be a virulence factor candidate.

Increased adipose energy storage in obesity promote insulin resistance and other metabolic adverse effects. To identify a new link between adipocyte and insulin resistance, we performed targeted metabolite profiling of differentiated adipocytes and studied the association between adipogenic metabolites and insulin resistance. We found a correlation between 2-aminoadipic acid (2-AAA) and adipogenic differentiation. Also, circulatory 2-AAA was positively associated with obesity-related factors (fat mass, fat percent, waist circumference, BMI, BMI z-score, triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR) at baseline and after 2 years in the children cohort study. Of these factors, increased BMI z-score and HOMA-IR were the primary independent factors associated with higher 2-AAA levels, and the baseline 2-AAA level was an indicator of the BMI z-score after 2 years. To validate the relationship between 2-AAA and obesity-related factors, we analyzed changes in 2-AAA levels following obesity intervention programs in two independent studies. In both studies, changes in 2-AAA levels during the intervention period were positively correlated with changes in the BMI z-score and HOMA-IR after adjusting for confounders. Moreover, the 2-AAA levels were increased in cell and mouse models of obesity-related insulin resistance. Excess 2-AAA levels led to impaired insulin signaling in insulin-sensitive cells (liver, skeletal muscle and adipose cells) and caused abnormal .

Both compounds affect energy transduction in isolated mitochondria and the present study aimed at characterizing the actions of these two compounds on liver metabolism and their cellular distribution in the isolated perfused rat liver. 2,4-D, but not picloram, increased glycolysis in the range from 10 to 400 μM. The redox potential of the cytosolic NAD-NADH couple was also increased by 2,4-D. Both compounds inhibited lactate . Inhibitions by 2,4-D and picloram were incomplete, reaching maximally 46% and 23%, respectively. Both compounds diminished the cellular ATP levels. No synergism between the actions of 2,4-D and picloram was detected. Biotransformations of 2,4-D and picloram were slow, but their distributions occurred at high rates and were concentrative. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that 2,4-D presented low affinity for the hydrophobic lipid bilayers, the opposite occurring with picloram. Inhibition of energy metabolism is possibly a relevant component of the toxicity of 2,4-D and of the commercial product Tordon. Furthermore, the interactions of 2,4-D with the membrane lipid bilayer can be highly destructive and might equally be related to its cellular toxicity at high concentrations.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that PXDN promotes prostate cancer progression via regulation of metabolic and oxidative stress pathways. We analyzed PXDN expression in prostate tissue by immunohistochemistry and found increased PXDN expression with prostate cancer progression as compared to normal tissue or cells. PXDN knockdown followed by proteomic analysis revealed an increase in oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and  pathways. Additionally, Liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based metabolomics confirmed that PXDN knockdown induced global reprogramming associated with increased oxidative stress and decreased nucleotide biosynthesis. We further demonstrated that PXDN knockdown led to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis. Finally, PXDN knockdown decreased colony formation on soft agar. Overall, the data suggest that PXDN promotes progression of prostate cancer by regulating the metabolome, more specifically, by inhibiting oxidative stress leading to decreased apoptosis.

Further analysis of the DEGs dataset resulted in 324 upregulated genes, and 275 genes that were down regulated. Meanwhile, 36 genes were either up regulated or down regulated in different chemical treatments. All identified genes were uploaded in the web application for Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) for gene ontology enrichments and to identify Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathways. Some of the identified pathways included glycolysis/, steroid hormone biosynthesis, retinol metabolism, and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450. The same DEGs dataset was also analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. IPA identified several pathways including PXR/RXR activation, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, and xenobiotic metabolism signaling.

Metatranscriptome profiling revealed that P. donghaiense highly expressed genes related to N- and P-nutrient uptake, phagotrophy, energy metabolism (photosynthesis, oxidative phophorylation, and rhodopsin) and carbohydrate metabolism (glycolysis/, TCA cycle and pentose phosphate) during the bloom. Many genes in P. donghaiense were up-regulated at night, including phagotrophy and environmental communication genes, and showed active expression in mitosis. Eight microbial defense genes were up-regulated in the bloom compared with previously analyzed laboratory cultures. Furthermore, 76 P. donghaiense microRNA were identified from the bloom, and their target genes exhibited marked differences in amino acid metabolism between the bloom and cultures and the potential of up-regulated antibiotic and cell communication capabilities. These findings, consistent with and complementary to recent reports, reveal major metabolic processes in P. donghaiense potentially important for bloom formation and provide a gene repertoire for developing bloom markers in future research.Copyright © 2018.

To unravel the mitochondrial contribution to tissue-specific physiology, we performed a systematic comparison of the mitochondrial proteome and lipidome of mice and assessed the consequences hereof for respiration. Liver and skeletal muscle mitochondrial protein composition was studied by data-independent ultra-high-performance (UHP)LC-MS/MS-proteomics, and lipid profiles were compared by UHPLC-MS/MS lipidomics. Mitochondrial function was investigated by high-resolution respirometry in samples from mice and humans. Enzymes of pyruvate oxidation as well as several subunits of complex I, III, and ATP synthase were more abundant in muscle mitochondria. Muscle mitochondria were enriched in cardiolipins associated with higher oxidative phosphorylation capacity and flexibility, in particular CL(18:2) and 22:6-containing cardiolipins. In contrast, protein equipment of liver mitochondria indicated a shuttling of complex I substrates toward  and ketogenesis and a higher preference for electron transfer via the flavoprotein quinone oxidoreductase pathway. Concordantly, muscle and liver mitochondria showed distinct respiratory substrate preferences. Muscle respired significantly more on the complex I substrates pyruvate and glutamate, whereas in liver maximal respiration was supported by complex II substrate succinate. This was a consistent finding in mouse liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria and human samples. Muscle mitochondria are tailored to produce ATP with a high capacity for complex I-linked substrates. Liver mitochondria are more connected to biosynthetic pathways, preferring fatty acids and succinate for oxidation. The physiologic diversity of mitochondria may help to understand tissue-specific disease pathologies and to develop therapies targeting mitochondrial function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652719>Peroxiredoxin 6 Down-Regulation Induces Metabolic Remodeling and Cell Cycle Arrest in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) is the only member of 1-Cys subfamily of peroxiredoxins in human cells. It is the only Prdx acting on phospholipid hydroperoxides possessing two additional sites with phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and lysophosphatidylcholine-acyl transferase (LPCAT) activities. There are contrasting reports on the roles and mechanisms of multifunctional Prdx6 in several pathologies and on its sensitivity to, and influence on, the redox environment. We have down-regulated Prdx6 with specific siRNA in hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells to study its role in cell proliferation, redox homeostasis, and metabolic programming. Cell proliferation and cell number decreased while cell volume increased; import of glucose and nucleotide biosynthesis also diminished while polyamines, phospholipids, and most glycolipids increased. A proteomic quantitative analysis suggested changes in membrane arrangement and vesicle trafficking as well as redox changes in enzymes of carbon and glutathione metabolism, pentose-phosphate pathway, citrate cycle, fatty acid metabolism, biosynthesis of aminoacids, and Glycolysis/. Specific redox changes in Hexokinase-2 (HK2), Prdx6, intracellular chloride ion channel-1 (CLIC1), PEP-carboxykinase-2 (PCK2), and 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) are compatible with the metabolic remodeling toward a predominant gluconeogenic flow from aminoacids with diversion at 3-phospohglycerate toward serine and other biosynthetic pathways thereon and with cell cycle arrest at G1/S transition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311004>Assessment of mouse liver [1-13C]pyruvate metabolism by dynamic hyperpolarized MRS.</a></h2><p>Hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy has the unique ability to detect real-time metabolic changes in vivo owing to its high sensitivity compared with thermal MR and high specificity compared with other metabolic imaging methods. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of hyperpolarized MR spectroscopy for quantification of liver pyruvate metabolism during a hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp in mice. Hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate was used for in vivo MR spectroscopy of liver pyruvate metabolism in mice. Mice were divided into two groups: (i) non-stimulated 5-h fasted mice and (ii) hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamped mice. During clamp conditions, insulin and donor blood were administered at a constant rate, whereas glucose was infused to maintain isoglycemia. When steady state was reached, insulin-stimulated mice were rapidly infused with hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate for real-time tracking of the dynamic distribution of metabolic derivatives from pyruvate, such as [1-13C]lactate, [1-13C]alanine and [13C]bicarbonate. Isotopomer analysis of plasma glucose confirmed 13C-incorporation from [1-13C]pyruvate into glucose was increased in fasted mice compared with insulin-stimulated mice, demonstrating an increased  in fasted mice. The AUC ratios for [1-13C]alanine/[1-13C]pyruvate (38.2%), [1-13C]lactate/[1-13C]pyruvate (41.8%) and [13C]bicarbonate/[1-13C]pyruvate (169%) all increased significantly during insulin stimulation. Hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate can be used for in vivo MR spectroscopy of liver pyruvate metabolism during hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp conditions. Under these conditions, insulin decreased  and increased [1-13C]alanine, [1-13C]lactate and [13C]bicarbonate after a [1-13C]pyruvate bolus. This application of in vivo spectroscopy has the potential to identify impairments in specific metabolic pathways in the liver associated with obesity, insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p></html>
