The contribution of the triggering/ATP-sensitive potassium (K)-dependent Ca signalling and K-independent amplification pathways, that include anaplerosis and lipid signalling of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), are well established. A proposed model included a key role for a metabolic partitioning 'switch', the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)/malonyl-CoA/carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) axis, in beta cell glucose and fatty  signalling for insulin secretion. This model has gained overwhelming support from a number of studies in recent years and is now refined through its link to the glycerolipid/NEFA cycle that provides lipid signals through its lipolysis arm. Furthermore, acetyl-CoA carboxylase may also control beta cell growth. Here we review the evidence supporting a role for the ACC/malonyl-CoA/CPT-1 axis in the control of GSIS and its particular importance under conditions of elevated fatty  (e.g. fasting, excess nutrients,  and diabetes). We also document how it is linked to a more global lipid signalling system that includes the glycerolipid/NEFA cycle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643751>Colestipol.</a></h2><p>Colestipol is a nonabsorbed bile  sequestrant that is used a therapy of  and for the pruritus of chronic liver disease and biliary obstruction.

In this study, we investigated the effect of cuminaldehyde on NAFLD in rats fed a high fat diet (HFD). Male Wistar rats were fed a HFD for 42 days to induce NAFLD. The progression of NAFLD was evaluated by histology and measuring liver enzymes (alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase), serum and hepatic lipids (total triglycerides and total cholesterol), and oxidative stress markers (thiobarbituric  reactive substances, glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase). The HFD feeding increased the liver weight and caused NAFLD, liver steatosis, , oxidative stress, and elevated liver enzymes. Administration of cuminaldehyde ameliorated the changes in hepatic morphology and liver weight, decreased levels of liver enzymes, and inhibited lipogenesis. Our findings suggest that cuminaldehyde could improve HFD-induced NAFLD via abolishment of hepatic oxidative damage and . Cuminaldehyde might be considered as a potential aromatic compound in the treatment of NAFLD and obesity through the modulation of lipid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30760672>Effect of Oat and Tartary Buckwheat - Based Food on Cholesterol - Lowering and Gut Microbiota in Hypercholesterolemic Hamsters.</a></h2><p>The nutritional components in oat and tartary buckwheat had been assessed to have cholesterollowering effects. However, The effect of oat and tartary buckwheat based-food (OF) on cholesterol-lowering and gut microbiota in hypercholesterole hamsters was still limited studied because they are usually consumed in whole gran as well as after being processed. In this study, normal diets, high fat diet (HFD) with/without OF were fed to hamsters for 30 days respectively and growth parameters, metabolic parameters, and gut microbiota were investigated, respectively. It was found that OF significantly decreased plasma total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol), lowered liver TC, cholesterol ester (CE), and triglycerides (TG) concentrations, and increased fecal weight and bile  (BA) concentrations, compared with HFD (p < 0.05). Moreover, the concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate and total short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) were significantly increased in hamsters fed with OF, compared with HFD (p < 0.05). OF changed the overall structure of gut microbiota. The relative abundances of Erysipelotrichaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae were decreased and the relative abundance of Eubacteriaceae was increased, compared with HFD. These results suggested that OF could reduce the concentrations of plasma lipid by inhibiting cholesterol absorption in liver and promoting excretions of fecal lipid and BA. And it also increased SCFAs and modulated the gut microbiota effectively to exert the hypocholesterolemic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31023823>Hepatocyte-specific deletion of lysosomal  lipase leads to cholesteryl ester but not triglyceride or retinyl ester accumulation.</a></h2><p>Lysosomal  lipase (LAL) hydrolyzes cholesteryl ester (CE) and retinyl ester (RE) and triglyceride (TG). Mice globally lacking LAL accumulate CE most prominently in the liver. The severity of the CE accumulation phenotype progresses with age and is accompanied by hepatomegaly and hepatic cholesterol crystal deposition. In contrast, hepatic TG accumulation is much less pronounced in these mice, and hepatic RE levels are even decreased. To dissect the functional role of LAL for neutral lipid ester mobilization in the liver, we generated mice specifically lacking LAL in hepatocytes (hep-LAL-ko). On a standard chow diet, hep-LAL-ko mice exhibited increased hepatic CE accumulation but unaltered TG and RE levels. Feeding the hep-LAL-ko mice a vitamin A excess/high-fat diet (VitA/HFD) further increased hepatic cholesterol levels, but hepatic TG and RE levels in these mice were lower than in control mice. Performing  activity assays with lysosome-enriched fractions from livers of mice globally lacking LAL, we detected residual  hydrolytic activities against TG and RE. Interestingly, this non-LAL  TG hydrolytic activity was elevated in lysosome-enriched fractions from livers of hep-LAL-ko mice upon VitA/HFD feeding. In conclusion, the neutral lipid ester phenotype in livers from hep-LAL-ko mice indicates that LAL is limiting for CE turnover, but not for TG and RE turnovers. Furthermore,  hydrolase activity assays revealed the existence of non-LAL  hydrolytic activities for TG and RE. The corresponding  lipase(s) catalyzing these reactions remains to be identified.© 2019 Pajed et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303829>Phytotherapeutic efficacy of the medicinal plant  L.</a></h2><p>Diabetes is a chronic, lifelong condition due to inadequate production of insulin or the cells does not properly respond it. Recently, the significance and effectiveness of herbal drugs associated with diabetes has emerged. The aim of the present study was to determine the anti-diabetic effects of  L. leaves on streptozotocin (STZ)-treated rats. Two different concentrations of ethanolic leaf extract (300 and 500 mg/kg) of  were used to treat diabetic rats, and biochemical parameters were analyzed in blood samples. The results of herbal treatments were compared with the standard drug, glibenclamide. The ethanol extract (500 mg/kg) had significant anti-diabetic activity by altering blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, liver glycogen, glucose 6-phosphatase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, glucokinase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, urea, uric  and creatinine levels while increasing insulin levels.

However, it remains debatable whether higher SUA is independently associated with new-onset kidney disease and rapid eGFR decline in individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m and negative proteinuria.This was a large, single-center, retrospective 6-year cohort study at People's Hospital of Tonglu County, Zhejiang, from 2001 to 2006. We enrolled 10,677 participants (19-92 years) with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m and without dipstick proteinuria at baseline. The association between SUA change and the occurrence of renal outcomes and annual eGFR decline were evaluated using Cox models with adjustment for confounders.Higher quartiles (2.51%) of SUA levels were associated with greater prevalence of kidney disease compared with quartile 1 (0.52%), 2 (1.13%) and 3 (1.76%), respectively. In addition, greater baseline SUA levels [OR (95% CI) 3.29(1.68-6.45), p < 0.001] and increased SUA [1.36(1.23-1.50), p < 0.001] were all associated with greater odds of renal disease progression when comparing the 4th quartile of annual eGFR decline rate with the 1st quartile. In addition, both of higher baseline SUA levels and increased SUA change were the risk factors of rapid annual eGFR decline along with male gender, lower albumin, hematocrit and creatinine levels, higher hemoglobin levels and  after multivariable adjustments when compared with each quartile group.Increasing SUA were independent risk factor for the prevalent of kidney disease and rapid eGFR decline and reduced SUA over time could abate kidney disease development in a Chinese community.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31414129>Paradoxical Hypercholesterolemia in an Otherwise Healthy Adult Man.</a></h2><p>Hypercholesterolemia is characterized by serum cholesterol levels greater than 5 mmol per L. However, the distribution of cholesterol among lipoprotein classes has a significant bearing on diagnosis: high-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol suggests familial hypercholesterolemia, whereas high-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is associated with hyperalphalipoproteinemia. On routine screening, a 23-year-old man presented with a total cholesterol level of 7.6 mmol per L but was subsequently found to have an HDL cholesterol level of 5.6 mmol per L.

Diabetes was induced by daily 55 mg/kg intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (STZ) solution over five days. Diabetic mice were randomly divided into six groups and orally gavaged with SA (at three dosages) or glibenclamide (Glib), fenofibrate (Feno) or vehicle for 3 weeks. Our findings showed that STZ-induced diabetic mice had significantly increased fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1), plasma triglyceride (TG), and total cholesterol (TC) levels ( < 0.001,  < 0.001,  < 0.001, and  < 0.05, respectively) but decreased blood insulin, adiponectin, and leptin levels compared to those of the control group ( < 0.001,  < 0.001, and  < 0.001, respectively). Administration of SA to STZ-induced diabetic mice may lower blood glucose but it increased the insulin levels with restoration of the size of the islets of Langerhans cells, implying that SA protected against STZ-induced diabetic states within the pancreas. At the molecular level, SA treatment exerts an increase in skeletal muscle expression levels of membrane glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and phospho-Akt to increase the membrane glucose uptake, but the mRNA levels of PEPCK and G6Pase are decreased to inhibit hepatic glucose production, thus leading to its hypoglycemic effect. Moreover, SA may cause hypolipidemic effects not only by enhancing hepatic expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) with increased fatty  oxidation but also by reducing lipogenic fatty  synthase (FAS) as well as reducing mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)1 and SREBP2 to lower blood TG and TC levels. Our findings demonstrated that SA displayed a protective effect against type 1 diabetes and a hyperlipidemic state in STZ-induced diabetic mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939294>Hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis: progress on disease mechanisms and treatment modalities.</a></h2><p>Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common and destructive inflammatory condition of the pancreas. Hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP) has become the second major cause of AP. Although the association between HTG and AP is well established, HTG as a risk factor of AP in the general population is not well identified. In this review, we summarize recent progress in our understanding of the pathogenesis of HTG-AP and clinical management of this disease. The mechanism responsible for HTG-AP is related to high-level free fatty  (FFA), microcirculatory disorder, oxidative stress, Ca2+ overload, and genetic polymorphism. Heparin and insulin therapy in diabetic patients with HTG can dramatically reduce triglyceride levels. Use of plasmapheresis is still experimental and better-designed studies are needed to evaluate the promise in the management of HTG-AP. Dietary intervention, lifestyle changes, and control of secondary causes are critical to the management and treatment of HTG-AP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31193933>Dihydromyricetin-rich herbal mixture extracts as a potential prescription for treatment of metabolic syndrome in rats fed a high-fat diet and subacute toxicity assessment in rats.</a></h2><p>Dihydromyricetin (DHM)-rich herbal mixture extracts, also called APF complex, comprised of , , and . The content of DHM in APF complex was 362.7 ± 12.5 mg/g. The aims of this study were to investigate the therapeutic effects of APF complex on metabolic syndrome in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and evaluate the subacute toxicity of APF complex in rats. HFD significantly increased body weight gain, fat tissue (epididymal fat, mesenteric fat, and perirenal fat) deposition, body fat index, and hepatic triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) accumulation as well as caused abnormal blood biochemical parameters, including TC, TG, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), free fatty  (FFA), and glucose. APF complex has a tendency but not significance to limit HFD-induced body weight gain. APF complex also significantly improved HFD-induced body fat accumulation, as evidenced by decreasing fat tissue deposition and body fat index. In addition, APF complex significantly ameliorated HFD-induced  and hyperglycemia, as evidenced by reducing levels of blood TG and TC as well as blood glucose and FFA, respectively. Furthermore, APF complex significantly decreased HFD-induced hepatic TG and TC accumulation. In subacute toxicity assessment, APF complex exhibited no toxicological signs, as evidenced by without affecting mortality, food and water consumption, body weight changes, absolute organ weights, hematological system, blood lipids and nutritional status, and electrolyte balance as well as non-toxic to liver and renal function. Overall, APF complex was considered as a non-toxic herbal prescription and could act as adjuvant therapy for metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202710>The protective role of the MKP-5-JNK/P38 pathway in glucolipotoxicity-induced islet β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Hyperglycemia and  (glycolipotoxicity)-triggered islet β-cell dysfunction is known to drive the progression of obesity-related type 2 diabetes, however the underlying mechanisms have not been clearly elucidated. The current study aimed to investigate the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 5 (MKP-5) in islet cells under glucolipotoxic conditions. Using gene overexpression and knockdown approaches, we demonstrated that MKP-5 could alleviate glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial apoptosis pathways owing to the altered regulation of caspase family members and ER stress-related molecules in MIN6 and primary islet cells. Overexpression of MKP-5 reversed the glucose and palmitic  (GP)-induced impairment of insulin secretion as well as the abnormal decreases in the expression of islet functional genes, thereby maintaining the normal insulin secretory functionality, whereas the absence of MKP-5 aggravated islet cell dysfunction. In parallel, the production of ROS and increased inflammation-associated genes in response to GP were also reduced upon MKP-5 overexpression. Further, inhibition of JNK or P38 MAPK pathways resisted to glucolipotoxicity observed in MKP-5 knockdown MIN6 cells. These findings indicate that MKP-5 is an important mediator for glucolipotoxicity-induced islet cell dysfunction and apoptosis, with JNK and P38 as the critical downstream pathways.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Oocyte maturation under these lipotoxic conditions results in increased oxidative stress levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced developmental competence and disappointing IVF results.A well-described bovine oocyte IVM model was used, where a pathophysiologically relevant elevated FF concentrations of palmitic  (PA; 150 μM or 300 μM) were added to induce oxidative stress. After fertilization (Day 0, D0), zygotes were in vitro cultured (IVC, from D1 to D8) in standard fatty -free media in the presence or absence of Mitoquinone or its carrier triphenyl-phosphonium.Embryo cleavage and fragmentation (D2) and blastocyst rates (D8) were recorded. Mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress in cleaved embryos at D2 were determined using specific fluorogenic probes and confocal microscopy. D8 blastocysts were used to (i) examine the expression of marker genes related to mitochondrial unfolded protein responses (UPRmt; HSPD1 and HSPE1), mitochondrial biogenesis (TFAM), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) UPR (ATF4, ATF6 and BiP) and oxidative stress (CAT, GPX1 and SOD2) using real time RT-PCR; (ii) determine cell differentiation and apoptosis using CDX-2 and cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining; and (iii) measure mtDNA copy numbers. This was tested in a series of experiments with at least three independent replicates for each, using a total of 2525 oocytes. Differences were considered significant if a P value was <0.05 after Bonferroni correction.Exposure to PA during IVM followed by culture under control conditions resulted in a significant increase in oxidative stress in embryos at D2. This was associated with a significant reduction in mitochondrial inner membrane potential (uncoupling) compared with solvent control (P < 0.05). The magnitude of these effects was PA-concentration dependent. Consequently, development to the blastocysts stage was significantly hampered. Surviving blastocysts exhibited high apoptotic cell indices and upregulated mRNA expression indicating persistent oxidative stress, mitochondrial and ER UPRs. In contrast, supplementation of PA-derived zygotes with Mitoquinone during IVC (i) prevented mitochondrial uncoupling and alleviated oxidative stress at D2; and (ii) rescued blastocyst quality; normalized oxidative stress and UPR related genes and apoptotic cell indices (P > 0.01 compared with solvent control). Mitoquinone also improved blastocyst rate in PA-exposed groups, an effect that was dependent on PA concentration.N/A.This is a fundamental study performed using a bovine in vitro model using PA-induced lipotoxicity during oocyte maturation. PA is the most predominant FFA in the FF that is known to induce lipotoxicity; however, in vivo maturation in patients suffering from maternal metabolic disorders involve more factors that cannot be represented in one model. Nevertheless, focusing on the carryover oxidative stress as a known key factor affecting developmental competence, and considering the novel beneficial rescuing effects of Mitoquinone shown here, we believe this model is of high biological relevance.Human oocytes collected for IVF treatments from patients with maternal metabolic disorders are vulnerable to lipotoxicity and oxidative stress during in vivo maturation. The results shown here suggest that mitochondrial targeted therapy, such as using Mitoquinone, during IVC may rescue the developmental competence and quality of these compromised oocytes. After further clinical trials, this may be a valuable approach to increase IVF success rates for infertile patients experiencing metabolic disorders.This study was financially supported by a BOF/KP grant number 34399, from the University of Antwerp, Belgium.

Here, we evaluated whether pegloticase, a recombinant uricase conjugated to polyethylene glycol, which can lead to persistently low serum urate levels (<1 mg/dL), can modulate BP in subjects with chronic refractory gout. This post hoc analysis used results from two 6-month randomized clinical trials in which subjects were treated with 8 mg pegloticase every 2 or 4 weeks (q2w or q4w) or placebo. Responders in this study were defined as those individuals in whom a persistently low urate level (<6 mg/dL and usually <1 mg/dL) was maintained. Serial sitting BP was measured in 173 subjects, and estimated glomerular filtration rate was determined at baseline and after 3 and 6 months. Significant reductions in mean arterial pressure (MAP) from baseline to 6 months were noted in q2w responders ( P=0.0028), whereas reductions in MAP in other groups were not significant. Significant decreases in both systolic and diastolic BP paralleled the change in MAP. Of the 62% of q2w responders exhibiting persistent decreases in MAP, there were no significant differences in baseline age, sex, race, weight, body mass index, history of hypertension, , history of coronary artery disease, gout duration, MAP, serum urate, estimated glomerular filtration rate or urinary uric /creatinine ratio compared with those who did not lower MAP. No significant changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate occurred in any of the groups during the study. Responders to biweekly pegloticase who maintained a persistently lower serum urate level throughout the trial experienced significant reductions in both systolic and diastolic BP that were independent of changes in renal function.

A retrospective observational cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>The Japanese government has developed and promoted a national nutrient-based dietary guideline for preventing lifestyle-related chronic disease. However, its impact in a real-life setting has never been evaluated. We performed a critical appraisal of the guideline by examining the association between adherence to the guideline and lifestyle-related outcome indicators.This is a retrospective observational cross-sectional study using nationally representative data on health and nutrition characteristics from the 2016 National Health and Nutrition Survey of Japan. We considered 3,861 participants aged ≥20 years, with evidence of low health risks of diabetes, hypertension, , and obesity. Five health outcome indicators (hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and body mass index), were employed. A summary score was developed to reflect adherence to the recommended intake of seven nutrients defined by the guideline, including proteins, fat, saturated fatty , carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sodium, and potassium. Multivariate quartile regression approaches were employed to examine the association between the adherence score and the health outcome indicators, adjusting for the covariates.Overall, the proportion of those who adhered to the guideline (adherence rate) for all seven nutrients was only 0.3%. There was considerable variation in the adherence rate between the different nutrients, from 24.2% to 61.8%. After adjustment for covariates, in most health outcome indicators, regardless of age category and quartile, there was no clear association between the guideline adherence score and indicators.There is plenty of scope for improving the guideline. Nutrient impact on health may not necessarily depend on the amount of each nutrient in the diet.

Fasting causes a massive influx of adipose-derived fatty  into the liver. The liver in the fasted state is therefore bloated with LDs but, remarkably, still continues to secrete triglycerides at a constant rate. Here we show that insulin signaling elevates phosphatidic  (PA) dramatically on LDs in the fed state. PA then signals to recruit kinesin-1 motors, which transport LDs to the peripherally located smooth ER inside hepatocytes, where LDs are catabolized to produce lipoproteins. This pathway is down-regulated homeostatically when fasting causes insulin levels to drop, thus preventing dangerous elevation of triglycerides in the blood. Further, we show that a specific peptide against kinesin-1 blocks triglyceride secretion without any apparent deleterious effects on cells. Our work therefore reveals fundamental mechanisms that maintain lipid homeostasis across metabolic states and leverages this knowledge to propose a molecular target against .© 2019 Kumar et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30871361>A Randomized Clinical Efficacy Trial of Red Yeast Rice (Monascus pilosus) Against .</a></h2><p>Red yeast rice (RYR) has been used as an alternative treatment for . According to the previous studies, other compounds, besides monacolin K in RYR, may also reduce the serum lipid level. This study aims at examining the efficacy of monacolin K-rich and Gamma-Aminobutyric  (GABA)-rich RYR (Monascus pilosus) with regards to treating  in a randomized control, double-blind clinical trial. In the research, we assigned 50 eligible subjects to monacolin K-rich RYR, GABA-rich RYR and placebo groups (  , 17, 17, respectively). The concentrations of TC, LDL-C, HDL, TG and blood biochemical data were evaluated at different phases: before applying (visit 1), after 1-month (visit 2), 2-month (visit 3), 3-month (visit 4) of providing the intervention and 1-month after ending the test food (visit 5) among three groups. During the 3-month intervention, the serum TC and LDL-C levels decreased significantly in the monacolin K group compared to the baseline and the other two groups. The Serum TG level declined steadily but was not statistically significant. Meanwhile, no marked differences in the serum HDL level were revealed among the three groups. Most safety assessment data had minor variation except two subjects (in monacolin K and GABA group separately) reported elevated liver enzymes. Monacolin K-rich RYR can reduce cholesterol as expected, while the GABA-rich RYR performed non-significant reduction on serum triglyceride. The research results demonstrate that using different concentrations and ratios between monacolin K and GABA could be beneficial for antihyperlipidemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31361112>Sustained Release Strategy Designed for Lixisenatide Delivery to Synchronously Treat Diabetes and Associated Complications.</a></h2><p>Diabetes and its complications have become a global challenge of public health. Herein, we aimed to develop a long-acting delivery system of lixisenatide (Lixi), a glucose-dependent antidiabetic peptide, based on an injectable hydrogel for the synchronous treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and associated complications. Two triblock copolymers, poly(ε-caprolactone--glycolic )-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone--glycolic ) and poly(d,l-lactic --glycolic )-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(d,l-lactic --glycolic ) possessing temperature-induced sol-gel transitions, were synthesized by us. Compared to the two single-component hydrogels, their 1/1 mixture hydrogel not only maintained the temperature-induced gelation but also exhibited a steadier degradation profile in vivo. Both in vitro and in vivo release studies demonstrated that the mixture hydrogel provided the sustained release of Lixi for up to 9 days, which was attributed to balanced electrostatic interactions between the positive charges in the peptide and the negative charges in the polymer carrier. The hypoglycemic efficacy of Lixi delivered from the mixture hydrogel after a single subcutaneous injection into diabetic db/db mice was comparable to that of twice-daily administrations of Lixi solution for up to 9 days. Furthermore, three successive administrations of the abovementioned gel system within a month significantly increased the plasma insulin level, lowered glycosylated hemoglobin, and improved the pancreatic function of the animals. These results were superior or equivalent to those of twice-daily injections of Lixi solution for 30 days, but the number of injections was markedly reduced from 60 to 3. Finally, an improvement in , augmentation of nerve fiber density, and enhancement of motor nerve conduction velocity in the gel formulation-treated db/db mice indicated that the sustained delivery of Lixi arrested and even ameliorated diabetic complications. These findings suggested that the Lixi-loaded mixture hydrogel has great potential for the treatment of T2DM with significant improvements in the health and quality of life of patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487814>The Emerging Role of l-Glutamine in Cardiovascular Health and Disease.</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence indicates that l-glutamine (Gln) plays a fundamental role in cardiovascular physiology and pathology. By serving as a substrate for the synthesis of DNA, ATP, proteins, and lipids, Gln drives critical processes in vascular cells, including proliferation, migration, apoptosis, senescence, and extracellular matrix deposition. Furthermore, Gln exerts potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in the circulation by inducing the expression of heme oxygenase-1, heat shock proteins, and glutathione. Gln also promotes cardiovascular health by serving as an l-arginine precursor to optimize nitric oxide synthesis. Importantly, Gln mitigates numerous risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, , glucose intolerance, obesity, and diabetes. Many studies demonstrate that Gln supplementation protects against cardiometabolic disease, ischemia-reperfusion injury, sickle cell disease, cardiac injury by inimical stimuli, and may be beneficial in patients with heart failure. However, excessive shunting of Gln to the Krebs cycle can precipitate aberrant angiogenic responses and the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension. In these instances, therapeutic targeting of the enzymes involved in glutaminolysis such as glutaminase-1, Gln synthetase, glutamate dehydrogenase, and amino  transaminase has shown promise in preclinical models. Future translation studies employing Gln delivery approaches and/or glutaminolysis inhibitors will determine the success of targeting Gln in cardiovascular disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31234885>Cardiovascular, electrophysiologic, and hematologic effects of omega-3 fatty  beyond reducing hypertriglyceridemia: as it pertains to the recently published REDUCE-IT trial.</a></h2><p>Heart disease continues to affect health outcomes globally, accounting for a quarter of all deaths in the United States. Despite the improvement in the development and implementation of guideline-directed medical therapy, the risk of adverse cardiac events remains substantially high. Historically, it has been debated whether omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  provide clinical benefit in cardiac disease. The recently published REDUCE-IT trial demonstrated a statistically significant absolute risk reduction of 4.8% in its primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina) with the use of icosapent ethyl, which is a highly purified eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) ethyl ester. However, the mechanism of action of omega-3 fatty  is not commonly discussed. Moreover, the use of EPA was not without risk, as the incidence of atrial fibrillation was increased along with a trend towards increased bleeding risk.

We aimed to investigate the potential efficacy of HMF on preventing obesity and  in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and its underlying mechanisms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a normal diet or an HFD with or without HMF (0.02%, 0.04% and 0.08%, w/w) for 6 weeks. The supplementation of HMF not only significantly decreased body weight gain (HFD, 336.50 ± 18.84 g; LHMF, 309.43 ± 20.74 g; MHMF, 296.83 ± 13.88 g; HHMF, 265.71 ± 19.09 g; respectively, p < 0.05) and adipose tissues weight ( p < 0.05), but also markedly lowered serum levels of total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( p < 0.05) in the sixth week in a dose-dependent manner compared with the HFD group.

In heart, the accumulation of saturated fatty  has been determined to play a role in the development of heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) has been reported to possess key atheroprotective biological properties, including cellular cholesterol efflux capacity, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to test whether HDL could protect palmitic  (PA)-induced cardiomyocyte injury and explore the possible mechanisms.H9c2 cells were pretreated with HDL (50-100 μg/ml) for 2 h followed by PA (0.5 mM) for indicated time period. Our results showed that HDL inhibited PA-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, HDL rescued PA-induced ROS generation and the phosphorylation of JNK which in turn activated NF-κB-mediated inflammatory proteins expressions.

Histological analyses, Hg levels measurement and GRP78, CHOP, PPARα, PPARγ, leptin, adiponectin and CD11 mRNA expressions were performed in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT). Glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol and insulin plasma levels were also measured.Hg exposure reduced the absolute and relative eWAT weights, adipocyte size, plasma insulin levels, glucose tolerance, antioxidant defenses and increased plasma glucose and triglyceride levels. In addition, CHOP, GRP78, PPARα, PPARγ, leptin and adiponectin mRNA expressions were increased in Hg-treated animals. No differences in Hg concentration were found in eWAT between the untreated and Hg groups. These results suggest that the reduction in adipocyte size is related to the impaired antioxidant defenses, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the disrupted PPARs and adipokines mRNA expression induced by the metal in eWAT. These disturbances possibly induced a decrease in circulating insulin levels, an imbalance between lipolysis and lipogenesis mechanisms in eWAT, with an increase in fatty  mobilization, a reduction in glucose uptake and an activation of pro-apoptotic pathways, leading to hyperglycemia and .Hg is a powerful environmental WAT disruptor that influences signaling events and impairs metabolic activity and hormonal balance of adipocytes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We compared renal gene expression profiles in Zucker lean (ZL), Zucker obese (ZO), and Zucker diabetic (ZD) rats using cDNA microarray with quantitative verification of selected transcripts by real-time PCR. Compared to the 20-week-old ZL control (glucose: 110 ± 8 mg/dL), both prediabetic ZO (glucose: 157 ± 11 mg/dL) and diabetic ZD (glucose: 481 ± 37 mg/dL) rats displayed  and kidney injury with a high degree of proteinuria. cDNA microarray identified 25 inflammation and injury-related transcriptomes whose expression levels were similarly increased in ZO and ZD kidneys. Among them, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) was found to be the most highly upregulated in both ZO and ZD kidneys. Immunofluorescence staining of kidney sections revealed a strong correlation between lipid overload and KIM-1 upregulation in proximal tubules of ZO and ZD rats. In cultured primary renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs), administration of saturated fatty  palmitate resulted in an upregulation of KIM-1, osteopontin, and CD44, which was greatly attenuated by U0126, an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2.

Transgenic mice expressing human Apolipoprotein C3 (ApoC3) were used as a mouse model of hypertriglyceridemia. Fenofibrate (FNB), a PPARα agonist, was used as a positive control drug of decreasing high triglyceride. FNB (100 mg/kg) or RRFs (300 mg/kg) were given to the mice by gavage daily. Two weeks later, the changes of plasma lipid levels in the mice were measured by commercial kits, the clearance of triglyceride was evaluated by oral fat load test, and expression of the genes related to lipid β-oxidation and synthesis was detected in the mice livers by real time PCR.RRFs, as well as FNB, were found to significantly reduce plasma triglyceride (TG) levels in ApoC3 transgenic mice after administration of the drug for two weeks. Plasma lipid clearance rate was increased and lipid content in the mice livers was reduced after administration of RRF. Treatment with RRFs up-regulated mRNA expression of PPARα and its downstream gene of ACOX, while down-regulated mRNA expression of the genes related to fatty  synthesis (FASN, SREBP-1c, and ACC1). The expression of LPL was raised, while the expression of ApoC3 was decreased, and Foxo1 was inhibited by RRFs in the mice livers.RRFs can reduce plasma TG levels by repressing the expression of ApoC3 and inducing the expression of LPL in liver. RRFs could also reduce triglyceride in hepatocytes through increasing β-oxidation and decreasing synthesis of the lipids.

Neointimal hyperplasia is a significant resulting morbidity. Increased fatty  (FA) levels lead to dysfunctional endothelium, defined as activated, proinflammatory and prothrombotic. The purpose of this review is to assess the recent literature on the emerging concept that uptake of FA into many tissues is regulated at the endothelial level, and this in turn contributes to endothelial dysfunction, an initiating factor in insulin resistant states, atherosclerosis and neointimal hyperplasia.Studies support the role of endothelial FA uptake proteins as an additional level of regulation in tissue FA uptake. These proteins include CD36, FA transport proteins, FA-binding proteins and caveolin-1. In many cases, inappropriate expression of these proteins can result in a change in FA and glucose uptake, storage and utilization. Accumulation of plasma FA is one mechanism by which alterations in expression of FA uptake proteins can lead to endothelial dysfunction; changes in tissue substrate metabolism leading to inflammation are also implicated.Identification of the critical players and regulators can lead to therapeutic targeting to reduce endothelial dysfunction and sequela such as insulin resistance and neointimal hyperplasia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401496>Anthraquinones in the aqueous extract of Cassiae semen cause liver injury in rats through lipid metabolism disorder.</a></h2><p>Cassiae semen has been used as the tea or medicine component to treat  or for hepatoprotection.

Lipidomic analysis of rat serum was performed by LC-MS to investigate the specifically changed lipids caused by the aqueous extract treatment. The components absorbed in plasma were detected by UHPLC-Q-Exactive-MS. MTT assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of these components absorbed in plasma.The serum levels of ALP, AST, ALT, LDH were increased on day 7 with some of which gradually dropped to normal level on day 28. In high dose of the aqueous extract treated group, the histopathological changes were observed based on the cytoplasmic vacuolation in the liver and the increase of bile , indicating the hepatotoxicity of the aqueous extract. The changes of TC, TG, LDL, HDL indicated the disorder of lipid metabolism. By comparing the difference in lipids between high dose group and control group, the results showed that the alterations were primarily focused on glycerophospholipid metabolism in both male and female rats. In addition, the glycerolipid metabolism in female rats also changed. Further analyses found that PC (18:2/20:4) and LysoPC 18:0 were significantly increased. Among these phytochemicals detected in plasma, nine components in the aqueous extract were considered to have the highest concentrations, particularly some types of anthraquinones (AQs) existing in Cassiae semen (AQs-in-CS), such as obtusifolin, aurantio-obtusin, and obtusin. The MTT assay showed that emodin, obtusifolin, rhein, aurantio-obtusin, and obtusin inhibited cell viability. Considering plasma concentrations and cytotoxicity of these components, our study indicates that the AQs-in-CS (obtusifolin, aurantio-obtusin and obtusin), emodin and rhein are the potential hepatotoxic phytochemicals in the aqueous extract.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Especially for butyrate, the lower quantitative limit of 1 ng/mL, 1600-fold higher in sensitivity than that of GC (1.6 μg/mL), ensured the accurate determination of its low level in blood or feces (88 ± 29 ng/mL in blood, 176 ± 18 μg/g in feces). Then, the validated method was applied for therapeutic studies of berberine in  hamsters in vivo and screening of 13 compounds (including five metabolites of berberine and eight typical isoquinoline alkaloids) in vitro. After berberine treatment (oral, 200 mg/kg, 2 weeks) to  hamsters, the levels of butyrate were significantly upregulated in blood (77 ± 10 ng/mL vs. 117 ± 13 ng/mL, *P < 0.05) and feces (132 ± 11 μg/g vs. 547 ± 57 μg/g, ***P < 0.001), which further verified butyrate as an active endogenous metabolite in coordination with berberine to lower the blood lipids. Additionally, the berberine metabolites (M1, M2, M3), as well as two isoquinoline alkaloids (tetrandrine and dauricine), could also obviously induce the production of SCFAs (butyrate, etc.) in gut microbiota. In total, we have successfully established a new derivative LC-MS/MS method for the targeted quantitative determination of seven SCFAs in biological samples.

ECs interact with the blood and lymph. The endothelium fulfils functions such as vasodilatation, regulation of adhesion, infiltration of leukocytes, inhibition of platelet adhesion, vessel remodeling and lipoprotein metabolism. ECs synthesize and release compounds such as nitric oxide (NO), metabolites of arachidonic , reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix. Endothelial dysfunction represents a phenotype prone to atherogenesis and may be used as a marker of atherosclerotic risk. Such dysfunction includes impaired synthesis and availability of NO and an imbalance in the relative contribution of endothelial-derived relaxing factors and contracting factors such as endothelin-1 and angiotensin. This dysfunction appears before the earliest anatomic evidence of atherosclerosis and could be an important initial step in further development of atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction was historically treated with vitamin C supplementation and L-arginine supplementation. Short term improvement of the expression of adhesion molecule and endothelial function during antioxidant therapy has been observed. Statins are used in the treatment of , a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Future studies should focus on identifying the mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of statins on the endothelium. This may help develop drugs specifically aimed at endothelial dysfunction.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31038369>Clinical trials of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) prescription products for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.</a></h2><p>: Hypertriglyceridemia is common and increases cardiovascular risk. Fish oil decreases triglyceride levels, but also increases low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which may negate any cardiovascular benefits. EPA, a component of fish oil, reduces triglyceride levels without increasing LDL cholesterol. : Two forms of purified EPA ethyl ester are available on prescription. This review considers the clinical trials of these purified esters to treat hypertriglyceridemia and shows that the EPA ethyl esters reduce triglyceride levels and reduce cardiovascular events. : To date, the effects of the purified EPA ethyl esters on cardiovascular events have only been tested in subjects taking statins. With statin treatment, if hypertriglyceridemia persists, it may be worthwhile considering adding an EPA ethyl ester. However, as the fibrates reduce the triglyceride levels by similar amounts to the EPA ethyl esters, while increasing the levels of HDL cholesterol, they are an alternative to EPA ethyl esters in combination with statins. As the proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors reduce triglycerides to a similar extent to the EPA ethyl ester, while reducing LDL cholesterol levels to a greater extent than the statins, they should be considered as an alternative to the statin/EPA ethyl ester combination.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583046>Antioxidant and Hypolipidemic Activities of -Depolymerised Exopolysaccharides by .</a></h2><p>The -depolymerised exopolysaccharides (ADES) of  were obtained, and the major fraction of ADES1 was isolated and purified by DEAE-52 cellulose anion-exchange column chromatography.

This study intended to analyze the effects of hazelnut oil supplementation on the serum lipid profile and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in hamsters fed a high-cholesterol (HC) diet. : Hamsters were fed a basic diet (control group) and an HC diet (HC group) for 16 weeks ( = 10 in each group). Hamsters were fed an HC diet for four weeks to induce  and were then fed an HC diet enriched with 5% (low-dose HC + HO group;  = 10) and 10% HO (high-dose HC + HO group;  = 10) for 12 weeks. Serum lipid levels, hepatic changes (including steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis), and hepatic prooxidant-antioxidant status (malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione S-transferase (GST)) were evaluated after the treatment period. : Hamsters in the control group showed normal serum lipid profiles, normal liver function, and moderate glycogen storage without hepatic steatosis. Hamsters in the HC group showed severe , severe hepatic steatosis, and moderate steatohepatitis (mononuclear cell and neutrophil infiltration, oval cell hyperplasia, and fibrosis). Compared to the HC group, both the low-dose and the high-dose HC + HO groups showed a significant reduction of  (serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C levels)) and improved liver function (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)). Additionally, compared to the HC group, intrahepatic triglyceride accumulation (IHTC) was significantly higher in the HC + HO group, while the incidence of steatohepatitis was significantly lower. The intake of the HC diet was associated with a higher level of lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, MDA) and a lower concentration of hepatic antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GPx, and GST), and all these factors were partially improved in the low-dose and high-dose HC + HO groups.  Our findings indicate that the intake of HO reduced serum  and oxidative stress and ameliorated the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in hamsters fed a high-cholesterol diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31408589>[Lipolysis in very low density lipoproteins - locus minoris resistentiae - in the pathogenesis of hypertriglyceridemia. Positive effects of diet, polyenic fatty , statins and fibrates.]</a></h2><p>Inhibition of hydrolysis of palmitic and oleic triglycedires (TG) in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), slow formation of active apoВ-100 conformation, blockade of апоЕ/В-100 ligand formation in VLDL and their reduced uptake by insulin-dependent cells cause hypertriglyceridemia (HTG). Palmitic and oleic VLDL (>80% total VLDL) are not converted in low density lipoproteins (LDL). Atherosclerosis is not an alimentary deficiency of polyenic fatty  (PFA), but results from low in vivo bioavailability of PFA in LDL against the background of high dietary palmitic FA and palmitic LDL. Plasma PFA content and cellular PFA deficiency are as high as LDL cholesterol (CL). Primary prevention of atherosclerosis should be based on a decrease in dietary content of palmitic saturated FA, trans FA and a moderate increase in PFA. It seems highly unlikely that the xeobiotics statins, fibrates and probucol produce pleiotropic biological effects in vivo. These effects are brought about by phylogenetically early humoral mediators eicosanoids: prostacyclins, prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and resolvins. It is reasonable to suggest that all preparations which act according to the same algorithm activate TG hydrolysis in VLDL and normalize cellular uptake of PFA in linoleic and linolenic LDL via apoВ-100 endocytosis. Atherosclerosis is a syndrome of cellular deficiency of essential polyenic FA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31092085>Preventative, but not post-stroke, inhibition of CD36 attenuates brain swelling in hyperlipidemic stroke.</a></h2><p>The lack of inclusion of comorbidities in animal models of stroke may underlie the limited development of therapy in stroke. Previous studies in mice deficient of CD36, an immune receptor, indicated its contribution to stroke-induced inflammation and injury in hyperlipidemic conditions. The current study, therefore, tested whether pharmacological inhibition of CD36 provides neuroprotection in hyperlipidemic stroke. The hyperlipidemic mice subjected to stroke showed an exacerbation of infarct size and profound brain swelling. However, post-stroke treatment with CD36 inhibitors did not reduce, and in some cases worsened, acute stroke outcome, suggesting potential benefits of elevated CD36 in the post-stroke brain in a hyperlipidemic condition. On the other hand, chronic treatment of a CD36 inhibitor prior to stroke significantly reduced stroke-induced brain swelling. There was a trend toward infarct reduction, although it did not reach statistical significance. The observed benefit of preventative CD36 inhibition is in line with previously reported smaller infarct volume and swelling in CD36 KO mice. Thus, the current findings suggest that insights gained from the genetic models should be carefully considered before the implementation of pharmacological interventions, as a potential therapeutic strategy may depend on preventative treatment or a post-stroke acute treatment paradigm.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30935037>Melatonin Improves Fatty Liver Syndrome by Inhibiting the Lipogenesis Pathway in Hamsters with High-Fat Diet-Induced .</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of melatonin on hepatic lipid metabolism in hamsters with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced dyslipidemia. Male Syrian hamsters were kept on either a chow control (C) or HFD for four weeks. After four weeks, animals fed the HFD were further randomly assigned to four groups: high-fat only (P), melatonin low-dosage (L), medium-dosage (M), and high-dosage (H) groups. The L, M, and H groups, respectively, received 10, 20, and 50 mg/kg/day of a melatonin solution, while the P and C groups received the ethanol vehicle. After eight weeks of the intervention, results showed that a low dose of melatonin significantly reduced HFD-induced hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides; decreased plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; and increased plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( < 0.05). In addition, melatonin markedly decreased activities of the hepatic lipogenic enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty  synthase (FAS) ( < 0.05), and elevated the relative hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1α expression in hamsters with HFD-induced . Consequently, melatonin reduced activities of the hepatic lipogenic enzymes, ACC and FAS. In summary, chronic melatonin administration improved HFD-induced dyslipidemia and hepatic lipid accumulation in Syrian hamsters with HFD-induced dyslipidemia, which might have occurred through inhibiting the lipogenesis pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518413>Gene expression profiling of the bone trabecula in patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head by RNA sequencing.</a></h2><p>Early diagnosis and treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is challenging. Bone trabecula play a vital role in the severity and progression of ONFH. In the present study, the investigators used gene expression profiling of bone trabecula to investigate gene alterations in ONFH patients. Osteonecrotic bone trabecula (ONBT) such as necrosis, fibrosis, and lacuna were confirmed by histological examination in the patients. The adjacent ''normal'' bone trabecula (ANBT) did not show any pathological changes. Gene sequencing data revealed that although ANBT showed no significant histological changes, alteration of mRNA profiling in ANBT was observed, similarly to that in ONBT. Our results indicated that the alteration of mRNA profiling in ANBT may cause normal bone tissue to develop into necrotic bone. RNA-seq data indicated that 2297 differentially abundant mRNAs were found in the ONBT group (1032 upregulated and 1265 downregulated) and 1523 differentially abundant mRNAs in the ANBT group (744 upregulated and 799 downregulated) compared with the healthy control group. GO enrichment analysis suggested that fatty  metabolism and degradation were the main zones enriched with differentially expressed genes (DEG). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that PPARγ pathway was the most significantly regulated pathway. Lipocalin-2 (LCN2), an osteoblast-enriched secreted protein, was significantly decreased in ONBT suggesting that downregulation of LCN2 might affect lipid metabolism and lead to , and thus promote pathogenesis of ONFH.© The Author(s) 2019.

Despite an accumulating number of studies, no pharmacotherapy that targets NAFLD has received general approval for clinical use.Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a promising approach to treat diabetes, obesity, and associated metabolic disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, on NAFLD and obesity-associated metabolic symptoms in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.Delayed intervention with NGI001 protected against body weight gain, hyperglycemia,  and hyperinsulinemia, compared with HFD alone. Adipocyte hypertrophy was prevented by administering NGI001. NGI001 inhibited impaired glucose metabolism and regulated the secretion of adipokines associated with insulin resistance. In addition, NGI001 supplementation suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, and had little impact on kidney function. In-depth investigations showed NGI001 ameliorated fat deposition and increased AMPK phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of its major downstream target, ACC, in human hepatocytes, HuS-E/2 cells. This cascade ultimately led to the downregulation of downstream fatty  synthesis-related molecules and the upregulation of downstream β oxidation-associated molecules. Surprisingly, NGI001 decreased gene and protein expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and glucose uptake in oleic -treated HuS-E/2 cells.Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of the novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, to attenuate or delay the onset of diet-induced metabolic diseases and NAFLD.This article is protected by copyright.

This relationship is continuous, unrelated to Lp(a) threshold, and independent of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Unfortunately, the mechanism(s) through which Lp(a) promotes atherosclerosis are not clarified yet. Suggested hypotheses include: an increased Lp(a)-associated cholesterol entrapment in the arterial intima followed by inflammatory cell recruitment, abnormal upload of proinflammatory oxidized phospholipids, impaired fibrinolysis by inhibition of plasminogen activation, and enhanced coagulation, through inhibition of the tissue factor pathway inhibitor. This review is aimed at summarizing the available evidence on the topic.There are two clinical forms, isolated (a) [HyperLp(a)] with acceptable LDL-C levels (< 70 mg/dL), and combined elevation of Lp(a) and LDL-C in plasma. To date, no drugs that selectively decrease Lp(a) are available. Some novel lipid-lowering drugs can lower Lp(a) levels, but to a limited extent, as their main effect is aimed at decreasing LDL-C levels. Significant Lp(a) lowering effects were obtained with nicotinic  at high doses. However, adverse effects apart, nicotinic  is no longer prescribed and available in Europe for clinical use, after European Agency of Medicines (EMA) ban. The only effective therapeutic option for now is Lipoprotein Apheresis (LA), albeit with some limitations. Lastly, it is to be acknowledged that the body of evidence confirming that reducing plasma isolated elevation of Lp(a) brings cardiovascular benefit is still insufficient. However, the growing bulk of clinical, genetic, mechanistic, and epidemiological available evidence strongly suggests that Lp(a) is likely to be the smoking gun.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30830364>Arachidonic  as a target for treating hypertriglyceridemia reproduced by a causal network analysis and an intervention study.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31220103>Metabolic modulation predicts heart failure tests performance.</a></h2><p>The metabolic changes that accompany changes in Cardiopulmonary testing (CPET) and heart failure biomarkers (HFbio) are not well known. We undertook metabolomic and lipidomic phenotyping of a cohort of heart failure (HF) patients and utilized Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) to identify associations to CPET and HFBio test performance (peak oxygen consumption (Peak VO2), oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES), exercise duration, and minute ventilation-carbon dioxide production slope (VE/VCO2 slope), as well as the established HF biomarkers of inflammation C-reactive protein (CRP), beta-galactoside-binding protein (galectin-3), and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)). A cohort of 49 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 50%, predominantly males African American, presenting a high frequency of diabetes, , and hypertension were used in the study. MRA revealed that metabolic models for VE/VCO2 and Peak VO2 were the most fitted models, and the highest predictors' coefficients were from Acylcarnitine C18:2, palmitic , citric , asparagine, and 3-hydroxybutiric . Metabolic Pathway Analysis (MetPA) used predictors to identify the most relevant metabolic pathways associated to the study, aminoacyl-tRNA and amino  biosynthesis, amino  metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, sphingolipid and glycerolipid metabolism, fatty  biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) found associations of our findings with pre-existing biological knowledge from studies of human plasma metabolism as brain dysfunction and enzyme deficiencies associated with lactic acidosis. Our results indicate a profile of oxidative stress, lactic acidosis, and metabolic syndrome coupled with mitochondria dysfunction in patients with HF tests poor performance.

Ethylacetate fraction of the aqueous extract of H. sabdariffa inhibited α-amylase and α-glucosidase with IC of 411.73 and 433.93 μg/ml, respectively. Furthermore, fractions I and II obtained from column chromatography inhibited α-amylase with IC of 27.03 and 20.12 μg/ml, and α-glucosidase with IC of 24.30 and 22.29 μg/ml, respectively. In addition, the principles reduced the serum glucose and lipid peroxide levels of diabetic rats and with an improvement in the rat lipid profiles and antioxidant defenses. Fractions I and II were identified as protocatechuic  and gallic , respectively, using  H and  C NMR. Protein-ligand docking showed that these compounds form multiple favorable interactions with the active-site residues of the two glycosidases. Overall, protocatechuic and gallic  emerge as natural antidiabetic agents. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Hibiscus sabdariffa (Zoborodo) is a refreshment drink for ceremonial gatherings in Nigeria. Also, its pharmacological use includes diabetes, hypertension, , metabolic syndrome, and hepatoprotection. The consumption of this food drink could improve diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and liver disease. Furthermore, the inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase could prevent diabetic complications associated with postprandial glucose.

The main objective of this study is to provide new thoughts in designing functional food with some lipid/glucose metabolism regulating effects for obese people. (2) Methods: The alleviating abilities of γ-oryzanol, phytosterol or ferulic -enriched wheat flour on lipid/glucose metabolic dysfunction were evaluated in male SD rats induced by a high-fat-fructose diet. The underlying mechanisms were clarified using western blot. (3) Results: In an in vitro cell model, γ-oryzanol, phytosterol and ferulic  regulate lipid/glucose metabolism by increasing the phosphorylation of AMPK and Akt, and PI3K expression, as well as decreasing expressions of DGAT1 and SCD. The in vivo study shows that ferulic  and γ-oryzanol-enriched flours are beneficial for managing body weight, improving glucose metabolism,  and hepatic lipid accumulation. Phytosterol-enriched flour exerted remarkable effects in regulating hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance and hyperuricemia. Western blot analysis of proteins from liver samples reveals that these enriched flours alleviated hepatic lipid accumulation and insulin resistance through their elevation in the phosphorylation of AMPK and Akt.

The present study examined the blood cholesterol-lowering activity of soybean germ oil and the underlying mechanisms in hypercholesterolemic hamsters. Forty hamsters were randomly assigned into five groups and fed a non-cholesterol diet, a high cholesterol diet and one of three high cholesterol diets containing 0.50% cholestyramine, 4.75% soybean germ oil, and 9.50% soybean germ oil, respectively, for 6 weeks. The result showed that soybean germ oil significantly decreased plasma cholesterol by 18.5-31.5%, which was accompanied by 28.3-62.7% increase in excretion of fecal neutral sterols and bile . The effect was mediated by down-regulation of intestinal Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein (NPC1L1) and up-regulation of liver cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). We concluded that soybean germ oil favorably modulated the blood cholesterol concentration by inhibiting cholesterol absorption through inhibiting gene expression of NPC1L1 and by enhancing bile  excretion via promoting gene expression of CYP7A1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31472226>Red raspberry extract (Rubus idaeus L shrub) intake ameliorates  in HFD-induced mice through PPAR signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Effects of red raspberry extract (RRE) intake on  mice induced by high-fat diet (HFD) were investigated in this study. After intragastric gavage of RRE for 8 weeks, the body weight and the adipose tissue mass of mice in RRE administration groups significantly (p < 0.05) decreased compared to the group without RRE treatment. RRE treatment significantly (p < 0.05) lowered triglyceride and total cholesterol levels of  mice. Pparα, Hmgcr, Ldlr, Cyp7a1, Acsl3, Pnpla2 and Pin4 were confirmed as the regulatory genes by transcriptome analysis and qRCR validation. According to KEGG pathway analysis, target genes such as Cyp7a1 and Pin4 were further regulated by the activation of PPARα resulting from RRE supplementation. Meanwhile, liver cholesterol synthesis and conversion were inhibited by the expressions of Hmgcr and Cyp7a1 genes regulated by RRE intake, and Ldlr gene was down-regulated to limit the transport of cholesterol. In addition, RRE treatment could accelerate the conversion from triglyceride to fatty .

This study demonstrated the effects of ethanol extracts of  (ELF) on a high-carbohydrate diet (HCD)-induced hyperlipidemia in C57BL/6 mice. The mice were divided into six groups ( = 7/group) as follows: normal diet, HCD, or HCD+ELF (100, 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg/day), which were orally administered daily for 12 weeks. Various lipid parameters and histological changes in liver and fat tissue were compared among the treatment and control groups. ELF remarkably reduced body weight gain and attenuated hyperlipidemia by improving the plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, atherogenic index, and cardiac risk factor. Moreover, ELF decreased the HCD-induced hepatic accumulation of lipid droplets and adipocyte hypertrophy. These regulatory effects of ELF appeared to be mediated through the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, and expression of fatty acid synthase. Taken together, these findings indicate a functional role for ELF in the regulation of HCD-induced obesity and hyperlipidemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31024687>Reduction of elevated lipids and low-density lipoprotein oxidation in serum of individuals with subclinical hypoxia and oxidative stress supplemented with lycosome formulation of docosahexaenoic .</a></h2><p>Thirty two individuals aged 40-65 years old with a moderate  (serum triglycerides > 150 mg/dl and LDL from 130 to 160 mg/dl) were supplemented once daily for 30 days with a 250 mg conventional formulation of docosahexaenoic  (DHA) without lycopene (CF-DHA) or 250 mg of lycosome-formulated DHA containing 7 mg of lycopene (LF-DHA). It was shown that ingestion of CF-DHA led to a transient increase in serum DHA level after 2 weeks of the trial, whereas LF-DHA did not cause significant changes in serum DHA. However, there was a noticeable increase in serum eicosapentaenoic  levels exceeding the pretreatment value by 42.8% and 39.1% after the 2nd and 4th weeks of LF-DHA ingestion.

Pharmacotherapy for metabolic diseases involves the modulation of gut microbiota, which is suggested to be a potential therapeutic target. In this study, the modulation of gut microbiota by statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs: atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) was investigated in an aged mouse model of high-fat diet-induced obesity, and the association between gut microbiota and immune responses was described. Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin significantly increased the abundance of the genera , , and  Moreover, the abundance of these genera was correlated with the inflammatory response, including levels of IL-1β and TGFβ1 in the ileum. In addition, oral fecal microbiota transplantation with fecal material collected from rosuvastatin-treated mouse groups improved hyperglycemia. From these results, the effect of statins on metabolic improvements could be explained by altered gut microbiota. Our findings suggest that the modulation of gut microbiota by statins has an important role in the therapeutic actions of these drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30892088>Novel hypolipidemic conjugates of fatty  and bile  with lysine for linkage.</a></h2><p>Novel fatty -bile  conjugates (1a-1k) were designed and synthesized by coupling of the fatty  to the 3-OH of bile  using lysine for linkage. In the conjugates, the 24-COOH of the bile  was kept intact to preserve liver-specific recognition. The ability of the newly synthesized conjugates (at 100 mg/kg dosage) to reduce total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels in mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) was evaluated. Conjugates of stearic  with cholic  and palmitic  with ursodeoxycholic  (at dosages of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) were further evaluated to determine their ability to reduce aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), TC, and TG levels in mice fed with HFD. All conjugates showed potent hypolipidemic activity. Further investigation revealed that compounds 1c and 1 g not only dose-dependently reduced serum levels of TC and TG, but also inhibited the elevation of serum AST and ALT levels in mice fed with HFD. Thus, compounds 1c and 1 g are promising hypolipidemic agents with hepatocyte protective effects against HFD-induced liver damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30912878>[Clinical biochemistry methods in objectiva evalution of overeating foood of carnivores (meat)by a phylogenetically herbivorous homo sapiens (a patient).]</a></h2><p>The abuse of food of carnivores (meat) by phylogeneticallyI herbivorous Homo sapiens (a patient) initiates atherosclerosis. Addressing biogenetic law of E. Haeckel that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny (a universal anamnesis), we suggest a diagnostic technique that allows evaluation of the meat diet abuse by a herbivorous Homo sapiens. This technique is based on application of phylogenetic theory of general pathology to clinical practice. The degrees of objective evaluation of nonphysiological overeating of meat are: the first, an increase in the fast plasma content of oleic triglycerides palmitoyl-oleyl-palmitate (POP). The second, hyperglyceridemia + an increase in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-CL) content. The third, increased plasma content of apoС-III. The fourth, an increase in the concentration of apoВ-48. If electrophoregrams are analyzed and hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP) type is determined according to WHO classification, the first degree of meat overeating is not informative, the second, corresponds to type IV HLP; the third, to type IIb HLP, and the forth, to type V HLP, i.e, the patient diet consists practically of the food of carnivores. Hyperlipoproteinemia coincides with insulin resistance syndrome, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, which is based on blood increase of fatty  in the form of polar unesterified fatty  (UFA). According to phylogenetic theory of general pathology, in vivo cells do not internalize glucose if there is a possibility to internalize UFA. Preventive examination allows evaluation of disorders in the biological function of trophology (food consumption). Thus, the use of different methods in the analysis of this function offers evaluation of the effectiveness of diet therapy from the level of disorders when treatment was started.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096578>Dietary Supplementation of Vine Tea Ameliorates Glucose and Lipid Metabolic Disorder via Akt Signaling Pathway in Diabetic Rats.</a></h2><p>A traditional Chinese tea with many pharmacological effects, vine tea (VT) is considered a potential dietary supplement to improve type 2 diabetes (T2D). To investigate the effect and mechanism of VT on glucose and lipid metabolic disorders in T2D rats, Wistar rats fed a normal diet served as the normal control, while rats fed a high-fat diet combined with low-dose streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T2D were divided into three groups: The model group (MOD); the positive control group (MET, metformin at 200 mg/kg/d); and the VT-treated group (VT500, allowed to freely drink 500 mg/L VT). After four weeks of intervention, biochemical metrics indicated that VT significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia,  and hyperinsulinemia in T2D rats. Metabolomics research indicated that VT regulated the levels of metabolites closely related to glucose and lipid metabolism and promoted glycogen synthesis. Furthermore, VT had a significant influence on the expression of key genes involved in the Akt signaling pathway, inhibited gluconeogenesis through the Akt/Foxo1/Pck2 signaling pathway, and reduced fatty  synthesis via the SREBP1c/Fasn signaling pathways. In conclusion, VT has great potential as a dietary supplement to ameliorate glucose and lipid metabolic disorders via the Akt signaling pathway in T2D rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30909733>Emerging Fixed-Dose Combination Treatments for .</a></h2><p>Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets may not be achieved by statin monotherapy, especially in high-risk patients.

The most common symptoms are dyslipidaemia and hypertransaminasemia, together with manifestations common to other lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), including visceromegalies and elevated plasma biomarkers. Alteration of the lipid-liver profile (LLP) has been widely applied as a criterion for LALD screening, but the usefulness of biomarkers has not yet been explored. Our purpose was to explore the utility of plasma chitotriosidase activity (ChT) and CCL18/PARC concentration in addition to LLP to identify LALD patients in an observational retrospective study of two different sample collections.Biological samples refining: Collection 1 (primary hypercholesterolemia suspected) included unrelated individuals with  and without LDLR, APOB and PCSK9 gene mutations (Set 1), and Collection 2 (LSD suspected) included individuals without definitive LSD diagnosis (Set 2). We assessed plasma LLP (total cholesterol and its fractions, TG concentration and transaminases activities), as well as plasma ChT and CCL18/PARC. All subjects with anomalous LLP and/or biomarker levels were LIPA sequenced.Twenty-four subjects showed altered LLP and/or biomarkers. We identified two LALD patients (one homozygous and one compound heterozygous) and one carrier of a novel LIPA variant.The measurement of plasma ChT and CCL18/PARC combined with LLP will be a useful approach to identifying LALD patients in retrospective LALD patient studies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It is well known that insulin resistance, especially hepatic insulin resistance, is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Current research has shown that hepatic fatty  accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway. Mitochondria are the major sites of fatty  β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of fatty . Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty -induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty  oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty  accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31030750>The biological activities of the antitumor drug Grifola frondosa polysaccharide.</a></h2><p>Grifola frondosa, a polypore fungus that grows at the base of trees, is an edible and medicinal mushroom with a large fruiting body characterized by overlapping caps.

However, its mechanisms responsible for anti-hyperlipidemic activity have not been fully identified. The aim of the study was to investigate the lipid-lowering mechanisms of C3R through inhibition of lipid digestion and absorption in vitro.The inhibitory activity of C3R against pancreatic lipase and cholesterol esterase was evaluated using enzymatic fluorometric and enzymatic colorimetric assays, respectively. An enzyme kinetic study using Michaelis-Menten and the derived Lineweaver-Burk plot was performed to understand the possible types of inhibition. The formation of cholesterol micelles was determined using the cholesterol assay kit. The bile  binding was measured using the colorimetric assay. The NBD cholesterol uptake in Caco-2 cells was determined using fluorometric assay. The mRNA expression of cholesterol transporter (Niemann-Pick C1-like 1) was determined by RT-PCR.The results showed that C3R was a mixed-type competitive inhibitor of pancreatic lipase with the IC value of 59.4 ± 1.41 μM. Furthermore, C3R (0.125-1 mM) inhibited pancreatic cholesterol esterase about 5-18%. In addition, C3R inhibited the formation of cholesterol micelles and bound to primary and secondary bile . In Caco-2 cells, C3R (12.5-100 μM) exhibited a significant reduction in cholesterol uptake in both free cholesterol (17-41%) and mixed micelles (20-30%).

Kaempferol showed LXR agonistic activities without inducing TGs or the expression of several lipogenic genes in cultured cells. A luciferase and qPCR analysis showed that kaempferol increased the transactivation of PPARα and PPARδ and stimulated gene expression associated with fatty  oxidation and uptake in hepatocytes. More importantly, kaempferol inhibited protein kinase B (Akt) activity and suppressed SREBP-1 activation via multiple mechanisms, including through increasing Insig-2a expression, reducing SREBP-1 phosphorylation, and increasing GSK-3 phosphorylation. Collectively, these actions inhibited the SREBP-1 activation process. Furthermore, as an Akt/mTOR pathway inhibitor, kaempferol led to the induction of hepatic autophagy and resulted in a decrease in lipid droplet formation in the mouse liver. These findings demonstrate that kaempferol exerts its TG-lowering effect via Akt inhibition and activation of PPARα and PPARδ. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Kaempferol is a major dietary flavonoid in various plant-based foods, and it is used as a valuable ingredient in functional foods, with numerous beneficial properties such as anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-atherosclerotic activities. Kaempferol exerts its TG-lowering effect via Akt inhibition and activation of PPARα and PPARδ.

Overweight dogs exhibit postprandial , highlighting the need to identify potential dysregulations in lipid metabolism. This study investigated metabolites related to lipid metabolism (i.e. acylcarnitines and taurine) and phospholipids in a feed-challenge test and aimed to identify metabolic variations in spontaneously overweight dogs. Twenty-eight healthy male Labrador Retriever dogs were included, 12 of which were classified as lean (body condition score (BCS) 4-5 on a 9-point scale) and 16 as overweight (BCS 6-8). After overnight fasting (14-17 h), fasting blood samples were collected and dogs were fed a high-fat meal followed by postprandial blood sample collection hourly for 4 h. Liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS) was used to identify plasma metabolites and phospholipids. Multivariate models, mixed model repeated measures and linear regression analyses were used for data interpretation.In all dogs, propionylcarnitine, stearoylcarnitine and nine phospholipids increased in response to food intake, while vaccenylcarnitine decreased (P ≤ 0.005 for all). Overall, carnitine and acetylcarnitine signal areas in the feed-challenge test were lower in overweight dogs (P ≤ 0.004). Notably, fasting plasma acetylcarnitine was lower in overweight dogs than in lean dogs (P = 0.001) and it did not change in response to feeding. The latter finding was in contrast to the decreased acetylcarnitine signal area found in lean dogs at one hour postprandially (P < 0.0001). One fasting phosphatidylcholine (PCaa C38:4) was higher in prominently overweight dogs (BCS > 6) than in lean dogs (P < 0.05).Plasma carnitine status was overall lower in spontaneously overweight dogs than in lean dogs in this cohort of healthy Labrador Retriever dogs, indicating a potential carnitine insufficiency in the overweight group. The acetylcarnitine response in overweight dogs indicated decreased fatty  oxidation at fasting and metabolic inflexibility to food intake. Further studies on metabolic inflexibility and its potential role in the metabolism of overweight dogs are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443411>Augmentation of Glucotoxicity, Oxidative Stress, Apoptosis and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in HepG2 Cells by Palmitic .</a></h2><p>Hyperglycemia and  are the hallmarks of diabetes and obesity.

Studies have suggested that increased availability of energy metabolites like glucose and saturated fatty  induces metabolic, oxidative, and mitochondrial stress, accompanied by inflammation that may lead to chronic complications in diabetes. In the present study, we used human hepatoma HepG2 cells to investigate the effects of high glucose (25 mM) and high palmitic  (up to 0.3 mM) on metabolic-, inflammatory-, and redox-stress-associated alterations in these cells. Our results showed increased lipid, protein, and DNA damage, leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Glucolipotoxicity increased ROS production and redox stress appeared to alter mitochondrial membrane potential and bioenergetics. Our results also demonstrate the enhanced ability of cytochrome P450s-dependent drug metabolism and antioxidant adaptation in HepG2 cells treated with palmitic , which was further augmented with high glucose. Altered NF-kB/AMPK/mTOR-dependent cell signaling and inflammatory (IL6/TNF-α) responses were also observed.

Hepatic cholesterol is then converted into bile  (BAs) that are secreted into the intestine and largely maintained within the enterohepatic circulation. We now aimed to evaluate the effects of prolonged brown fat activation combined with inhibition of intestinal BA reabsorption on plasma cholesterol metabolism and atherosclerosis development.APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice with humanized lipoprotein metabolism were treated for 9 weeks with the selective β3-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist CL316,243 to substantially activate brown fat. Prolonged β3-AR agonism reduced fecal BA excretion (-31%), while markedly increasing plasma levels of total BAs (+258%), cholic -derived BAs (+295%) and chenodeoxycholic -derived BAs (+217%), and decreasing the expression of hepatic genes involved in BA production. In subsequent experiments mice were additionally treated with the BA sequestrant Colesevelam to inhibit BA reabsorption. Concomitant intestinal BA sequestration increased fecal BA excretion, normalized plasma BA levels and reduced hepatic cholesterol. Moreover, concomitant BA sequestration further reduced plasma total cholesterol (-49%) and non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (-56%), tended to further attenuate atherosclerotic lesion area (-54%). Concomitant BA sequestration further increased the proportion of lesion-free valves (+34%) and decreased the relative macrophage area within the lesion (-26%) thereby further increasing the plaque stability index (+44%).BA sequestration prevents the marked accumulation of plasma BAs as induced by prolonged brown fat activation thereby further improving cholesterol metabolism and reducing atherosclerosis development. These data suggest that combining brown fat activation with BA sequestration is a promising new therapeutic strategy to reduce  and cardiovascular diseases.Current therapeutic strategies are unable to prevent the majority of cardiovascular disease (CVD)-relating morbidities and mortalities, illustrating the need for new therapeutic strategies. Brown fat has been shown as an emerging target to combat  and atherosclerosis. Here we showed that prolonged brown fat activation promotes bile  (BA) reabsorption, resulting in elevated plasma BA and hepatic cholesterol content, both of which are reversed by additional BA sequestration. Importantly, combining BA sequestration with brown fat activation further lowers plasma cholesterol and reduces atherosclerosis development, indicating the combination therapy as a new therapeutic strategy to treat , and ultimately CVD.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Daming capsule (DMC), a medicine for lowering blood lipids, is marketed in China; however, its mechanism is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which DMC reduces blood lipids.A rat model of  was established by feeding rats a high-fat diet (HFD), and the serum lipid levels were detected with an automatic biochemical analyser. DMC (162 mg/kg) and atorvastatin calcium (10 mg/kg) were orally administered to the hyperlipidaemic rats for 4 weeks. HFD feeding markedly induced increases in the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c); however, DMC treatment significantly decreased the levels of TC, TG, and LDL-c in rats serum. Meanwhile, the hepatic TC and TG levels, liver weight/body weight ratio, and body weight were significantly lower in the DMC-treated rats than in the HFD rats. Moreover, DMC significantly alleviated hepatomegaly, hepatic lipid deposition, and hepatic steatosis. The protein expression level of phospho-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) (Thr172) in HFD rat livers was lower than that in normal rat livers, whereas it increased in the liver of the DMC-treated rats; however, the protein expression level of total-AMPK in the liver was not different among the groups. The AMPK-activating effect of DMC was blocked by Compound C (a specific AMPK inhibitor) in HepG2 cells. Additionally, DMC considerably increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα) protein expression and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) transcription and concentration in the liver. This effect of DMC was also inhibited by Compound C in HepG2 cells. DMC also promoted LDL receptor (LDLR) protein expression by activating AMPK. We further found that DMC reduced the levels of TC and TG in oleic -treated HepG2 cells, and it restored the expression levels of p-AMPK, PPARα, LPL, and LDLR compared to the decreased levels observed in oleic -treated HepG2 cells.DMC lowered lipids in serum and the liver by activating AMPK. On the one hand, the activation of AMPK enhanced PPARα expression and LPL transcription to lead to the hydrolysis of TG; on the other hand, it increased LDLR protein expression to promote lipid metabolism.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Due to the metabolic characteristics of fructose, a rapid gastric emptying is produced, altering signals of hunger-satiety and decreasing the appetite. In addition to the hepatic level during catabolism, triose phosphate is generated and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is reduced, producing uric . Triose phosphate triggers the synthesis of fatty  that increase the production and accumulation of triglycerides, diacylglycerols and ceramides that induce insulin resistance. , insulin resistance and hyperuricemia contribute to the development of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and some kinds of cancer.

Lauric C12 LC is half the FA in coconut oil. Residents of southeast Asia with constant use of coconut oil, have a low level of diseases of the cardiovascular system in the population. With a regulatory intake with food C12:0 laurin FA formed moderate ketosis and neuroprotective effect. Unlike long-chain LC, medium-chain TG cells are not deposited either in visceral fat cells, or in insulin-dependent adipocytes. Medium-chain fatty  rapidly oxidize mitochondria; the formation of acetyl-CoA cells is used to form ketone bodies, activating thermogenesis in orange and brown adipocytes. Experiments with animals and observations in the clinic showed that taking medium-chain TG with food is more physiological than long-chain oils. This significantly increases the level of cholesterol in high-density lipoproteins. Food enriched with medium chain TG is optimal for increasing the ketone content in blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid without limiting the carbohydrate content in food. The formation of excess ketone bodies by cells can be achieved by activating the metabolic transformations of medium-chain FAs, without fasting and preserving carbohydrates in food. Coconut oil has a positive effect on the cardiovascular system, preventing the formation of atherosclerosis and atheromatosis. Effective in the prevention of the pathology of the cardiovascular system is a decrease in food amounts of palmitic , an increase in oleic , polyene FA with a simultaneous increase in the proportion of medium-chain FA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30860743>Fibric  Antilipemic Agents.</a></h2><p>Fibric  are FDA indicated to treat patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson types IIa and IIb). They reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B, and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in adults.

WAT browning confers beneficial effects on adiposity, insulin resistance, and . In this study, it was found out that circNrxn2 sponged miR-103 and enhanced FGF10 levels in HFD mice WAT. We discovered that circNrxn2 promoted WAT browning and mitochondria functions. Furthermore, circNrxn2 also increased M2 macrophage polarization in HFD mouse adipose tissue, and the PPARγ signaling pathway participated in these biological processes. Moreover, eliminating adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) by clodronate-crippled circNrxn2 promoted WAT browning, and the simulation co-culture of macrophages and adipocytes results suggested that circNrxn2 promoted WAT browning through increasing M2 macrophage polarization. Our finding revealed that circNrxn2 acted as an endogenous miR-103 sponge, blocked miR-103 effects, and relieved its inhibition of FGF10 expression to promote WAT browning through increasing M2 macrophage polarization.

(Mart.) O. Berg (Myrtaceae) leaves have been used to decrease cholesterol levels. However, studies to determine activities of this plant on triglycerides metabolism have received little attention. The aim of this study was to examine anti-hyperlipidemic effects of a  aqueous leaf extract (CxAE) and assess protective actions against oxidative stress and DNA damage. The tyloxapol-induced  model was used in Wistar rats. Rats were treated orally with CxAE either 250 or 500 mg/kg/day for 7 days prior to tyloxapol administration. Biochemical parameters, oxidative stress levels, and genomic instability were assessed in several tissues. CxAE decreased cholesterol and triglyceride levels in serum and hepatic and renal DNA damage in tyloxapol-treated rats. There was no marked effect on the micronucleus frequency in bone marrow.

Although several epidemiological studies have shown that hepatic low lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA expression may be associated with dyslipidemia and tumor progression, it is still not known whether the liver plays an essential role in  of Apc mice.We measured the expression of metabolic enzymes that involved fatty  uptake, de novo lipogenesis (DNL), β-oxidation and investigated hepatic triglyceride production in the liver of wild-type and Apc mice.We found that hepatic fatty  uptake and DNL decreased, but there was no significant difference in fatty  β-oxidation. Interestingly, the production of hepatic very low-density lipoprotein-triglyceride (VLDL-TG) decreased at 20 weeks of age, but marked steatosis was observed in the livers of the Apc mouse. To further explore hypertriglyceridemia, we assessed the function of hepatic glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) for the first time. GPIHBP1 is governed by the transcription factor octamer-binding transcription factor-1 (Oct-1) which are involved in the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway in the liver of Apc mice. Importantly, it was also confirmed that sn50 (100 μg/mL, an inhibitor of the NF-κB) reversed the tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-induced Oct-1 and GPIHBP1 reduction in HepG2 cells.Altogether, these findings highlighted a novel role of GPIHBP1 that might be responsible for hypertriglyceridemia in Apc mice.

We aimed to use two common genetic risk score (GRS) methods to construct prediction models for the efficacy of folic  therapy on HHcy, and the best gene-environment prediction model was screened out. A prospective cohort study enrolling 638 HHcy patients was performed. We used a logistic regression model to estimate the associations of two GRS methods with the efficacy.

To explore the mechanism by which probiotic-fermented milk improves lipid metabolism, the transcription of genes regulated by liver X receptors (LXRs), 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase, and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which play integral roles in lipid metabolism, was investigated in hyperlipidemic rats. Compared with rats fed a high-fat diet, the administration of probiotic-fermented milk significantly lowered the levels of total cholesterol (TC) and total triglycerides (TG) in rat serum and viscera ( < 0.05) and significantly increased the level of total bile  in the rat liver and small intestine ( < 0.05). The quantitative PCR results showed that the probiotics ameliorated the TC levels in the rats by activating the transcription of genes involved in the LXR axis, which promoted TC reverse transport and increased the conversion of TC to bile . The level of TG in the hyperlipidemic rats was ameliorated by the inhibition of the transcription of carbohydrate reaction element binding protein genes and activation of the transcription of PPARα genes.

The standardized MEACL was orally administered at different doses (250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg) to HFD-induced hyperlipidemic rats for five weeks. Serum lipid profile, body weight changes, body mass index (BMI), daily food intake, relative organ weight, and histology of the liver were evaluated. In addition, the effect of MEACL on HMG-CoA reductase and pancreatic lipase activities as well as hepatic and fecal lipids was demonstrated. MEACL supplementation reduced serum lipids in HFD-fed rats in a dose-dependent manner. Histopathological scores revealed that 1000 mg/kg MEACL restored the damage to liver tissue in hyperlipidemic rats. MEACL decreased the body mass index (BMI), atherogenic index, and hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides and increased fecal cholesterol and bile  in HFD-fed rats. Also, MEACL ameliorated lipid peroxidation and improved antioxidant defenses in the liver of HFD-fed rats. Furthermore, HMG-CoA reductase and lipase were suppressed by MEACL.

Previously, we described the antihypertriglyceridemic effect of the hydroethanolic extract of  leaf (HESc) in monosodium L-glutamate- (MSG-) induced obese rats. This study sought to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the antihypertriglyceridemic effect of HESc in MSG-obese rats. Newborn male Wistar rats were injected subcutaneously with MSG (4.0 g/kg/day, obese group) or saline 1.25% (1.0 mL/kg/day, lean group), from 2nd through 10th postnatal day. At 8 weeks old, obese rats started to be orally treated with HESc (0.5 or 1.0 g/kg/day,  = 7) or saline 0.9% (1 mL/kg/day,  = 7). Lean rats received saline solution (1 mL/kg/day,  = 7). Upon 8-week treatment, animals were euthanized for blood and tissue collection. Another set of adult nonobese Wistar rats was used for the assessment of HESc acute effects on Triton WR1339-induced hypertriglyceridemia. HESc reduced weight gain, as well as adipose tissue fat pads, without altering food intake of obese rats. HESc restored fasting serum glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and free fatty , as well as insulin sensitivity, to levels similar to lean rats. Additionally, HESc halved the triglyceride content into very low-density lipoprotein particles, as well as healed liver steatosis, in obese rats. Hepatic protein expression of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone GRP94 was decreased by HESc, which also downregulated the hepatic triglyceride secretion pathway by reducing the splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1s), as well as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) translational levels. This action was further corroborated by the acute inhibitory effect of HESc on triglyceride accumulation on Triton WR1339-treated rats.

We isolated IgA-targeted ( IgA21) and lumen lactic  bacterial strains ( FS1) from the fecal microbiota of a healthy woman. C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal (CON) or high fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks and then treated with IgA21 or FS1 for 4 weeks. HFD caused dyslipidemia, mucosal barrier damage, and intestinal microbiota abnormalities. Only IgA21 significantly inhibited dyslipidemia and gut barrier damage. This was related to significant up-regulation of mucin-2, PIgR mRNA expression, and colonic butyrate production ( < 0.05 vs. HFD). Unlike IgA21, FS1 caused a more pronounced gut dybiosis than did HFD, and, in particular, it induced a significant decrease in the  S24-7 group and an increase in  ( < 0.05 vs. CON). In conclusion, IgA-coated and non-coated lactic  bacteria of gut have been demonstrated to differentially affect the intestinal barrier and serum lipids.

We studied the mechanisms that underlie the cardiotoxic effects of a dual PPARα/γ agonist, tesaglitazar, in wild type and diabetic (leptin receptor deficient - db/db) mice. Mice treated with tesaglitazar-containing chow or high fat diet developed cardiac dysfunction despite lower plasma triglycerides and glucose levels. Expression of cardiac peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α), which promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, had the most profound reduction among various fatty  metabolism genes. Furthermore, we observed increased acetylation of PGC1α, which suggests PGC1α inhibition and lowered sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression. This change was associated with lower mitochondrial abundance. Combined pharmacological activation of PPARα and PPARγ in C57BL/6 mice reproduced the reduction of PGC1α expression and mitochondrial abundance. Resveratrol-mediated SIRT1 activation attenuated tesaglitazar-induced cardiac dysfunction and corrected myocardial mitochondrial respiration in C57BL/6 and diabetic mice but not in cardiomyocyte-specific Sirt1-/- mice.

Recently, we discovered that DNAs targeting microRNA-22-3p (miR-22-3p) hold the potential for treating obesity and related metabolic disorders (type 2 diabetes mellitus, , and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) by turning fat-storing white adipocytes into fat-burning adipocytes. In this work, we explored the effects of chemical modifications, including phosphorothioate (PS), locked nucleic  (LNA), and peptide nucleic  (PNA), on the structure and energy of DNA analogs by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. To achieve a reliable prediction of the hybridization free energy, the AMOEBA polarizable force field and the free energy perturbation technique were employed. The calculated hybridization free energies are generally compatible with previous experiments. For LNA and PNA, the enhanced duplex stability can be explained by the preorganization mechanism, i.e., the single strands adopt stable helical structures similar to those in the duplex. For PS, the S and R isomers (Sp and Rp) have preferences for C2'-endo and C3'-endo sugar puckering conformations, respectively, and therefore Sp is less stable than Rp in DNA/RNA hybrids. In addition, the solvation penalty of Rp accounts for its destabilization effect. PS-LNA is similar to LNA as the sugar puckering is dominated by the locked sugar ring. This work demonstrated that MD simulations with polarizable force fields are useful for the understanding and design of modified nucleic .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028858>Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry for the determination of 10 alkaloids in beagle plasma after the oral administration of the three Coptidis rhizoma extracts.</a></h2><p>Coptidis rhizoma (CR) is the dried rhizome of the ranunculaceous plant CR.

The anti-hyperlipidemia effect was studied in a rat model of acute hyperlipidemia, which was induced by triton WR-1339. A new compound, integrinol (), together with nine known compounds, namely chamazulene (), acetylenes (E)-2 (), acetylenes (E)-3 (), eugenol (), palmitic acid (), oleic acid (), linoleic acid (), linolenic acid () and 12,13-epoxylinolenic acid were isolated from the crude lipophilic extract of A. integrifolia. The LD50 value of the crude extract was more than 4g/kg. In Triton WR-1339-induced acute hyperlipidemia model, the crude lipophilic extract (200 mg/kg) significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC) by 70% ( ≤ 0.01) and triglycerides (TGs) by 94% ( ≤ 0.001). The fractioned compounds, such as chamazulene (1), acetylene-2 (2), and linolenic acid (9), used at 4 mg/kg dose, also significantly decreased the concentrations of TC (32%, 33% and 64%, respectively) and TGs (48%, 33% and 93%, respectively).

These results can improve the understanding of the biofunction of  mediated by DHA-PC from  roe, as well as provide a theoretical basis for the utilization of DHA-PC from  roe as a functional food additive.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30865796>Safety and Efficacy of Bempedoic  to Reduce LDL Cholesterol.</a></h2><p>Short-term studies have shown that bempedoic , an inhibitor of ATP citrate lyase, reduces levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Data are limited regarding the safety and efficacy of bempedoic  treatment in long-term studies involving patients with hypercholesterolemia who are receiving guideline-recommended statin therapy.We conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or both. Patients had to have an LDL cholesterol level of at least 70 mg per deciliter while they were receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy with or without additional lipid-lowering therapy. (Maximally tolerated statin therapy was defined as the highest intensity statin regimen that a patient was able to maintain, as determined by the investigator.) Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive bempedoic  or placebo. The primary end point was safety, and the principal secondary end point (principal efficacy end point) was the percentage change in the LDL cholesterol level at week 12 of 52 weeks.The trial involved 2230 patients, of whom 1488 were assigned to receive bempedoic  and 742 to receive placebo. The mean (±SD) LDL cholesterol level at baseline was 103.2±29.4 mg per deciliter. The incidence of adverse events (1167 of 1487 patients [78.5%] in the bempedoic  group and 584 of 742 [78.7%] in the placebo group) and serious adverse events (216 patients [14.5%] and 104 [14.0%], respectively) did not differ substantially between the two groups during the intervention period, but the incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation of the regimen was higher in the bempedoic  group than in the placebo group (162 patients [10.9%] vs. 53 [7.1%]), as was the incidence of gout (18 patients [1.2%] vs. 2 [0.3%]). At week 12, bempedoic  reduced the mean LDL cholesterol level by 19.2 mg per deciliter, representing a change of -16.5% from baseline (difference vs. placebo in change from baseline, -18.1 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -20.0 to -16.1; P<0.001). Safety and efficacy findings were consistent, regardless of the intensity of background statin therapy.In this 52-week trial, bempedoic  added to maximally tolerated statin therapy did not lead to a higher incidence of overall adverse events than placebo and led to significantly lower LDL cholesterol levels.

Overfeeding SFA vs PUFA for 8 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of caloric restriction.General community.Men and women who are overweight or have obesity (n = 61).Muffins, high in either palm (SFA) or sunflower oil (PUFA), were added to the habitual diet.Lean tissue mass (not reported here). Secondary and exploratory outcomes included liver and ectopic fat depots.By design, body weight gain was similar in SFA (2.31 ± 1.38 kg) and PUFA (2.01 ± 1.90 kg) groups, P = 0.50. SFA markedly induced liver fat content (50% relative increase) along with liver enzymes and atherogenic serum lipids. In contrast, despite similar weight gain, PUFA did not increase liver fat or liver enzymes or cause any adverse effects on blood lipids. SFA had no differential effect on the accumulation of visceral fat, pancreas fat, or total body fat compared with PUFA. SFA consistently increased, whereas PUFA reduced circulating ceramides, changes that were moderately associated with liver fat changes and proposed markers of hepatic lipogenesis. The adverse metabolic effects of SFA were reversed by calorie restriction.SFA markedly induces liver fat and serum ceramides, whereas dietary PUFA prevents liver fat accumulation and reduces ceramides and  during excess energy intake and weight gain in overweight individuals.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666183>Understanding why REDUCE-IT was positive - Mechanistic overview of eicosapentaenoic .</a></h2><p>The REDUCE-IT study found that patients at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) who were already taking statins obtained a marked benefit by taking 4 g/d of eicosapentaenoic  ethyl esters (icosapent ethyl, IPE; Vascepa) over about 5 years.

Meisn. is used to treat various metabolic diseases, such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, and .This study aimed to explore the antidiabetes potential of the flower of E. gardneri and investigate whether it can benefit the entire gut bacteria community.Chemical constituents of the extract were analyzed by UHPLC-Q Exactive Mass Spectrometer (UHPLC-QE-MS). The antidiabetes effect of the water extract (WAE) of the flower of E. gardneri was evaluated in diabetic mice induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ) (six groups, n = 8) daily at doses of 1, 2, and 3 g/kg for 4 weeks. The gut microbiota was analyzed using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) in the fecal were also investigated.UHPLC-QE-MS analysis identified 29 compounds, including five alkaloids, six coumarins, four flavonoids, 11 organic , and three additional compounds, in the WAE. Results showed that the high dose of WAE considerably decreased the blood glucose level by 30.0%. Furthermore, E. gardneri significantly ameliorated insulin resistance and lipid metabolism dysfunction and repaired islet, hepatic, and white fat and colon histology in diabetic mice. Diabetic mice treated with WAE showed apparent changes in the structure and composition of the gut microbiota. WAE reversed the changes in Clostridiales, Lachnospiraceae, S24-7, Rikenellaceae, and Dorea in diabetic mice. The correlation analysis indicated that key OTUs were related to diabetes indices. The amounts of SCFAs, including acetic, propionic, and valeric , were significantly high in WAE-treated diabetic groups.E. gardneri treatment improved the glucose metabolism and reshaped the unbalanced gut microbiota of diabetic mice.

Cone-rod dystrophy presents as progressive visual impairment, photophobia, and nystagmus usually starting between birth and age 15 months. Many individuals lose all perception of light by the end of the second decade, but a minority retain the ability to read large print into the third decade. Children usually have normal birth weight but develop truncal obesity during their first year. Sensorineural hearing loss presents in the first decade in as many as 70% of individuals and may progress to the severe or moderately severe range (40-70 db) by the end of the first to second decade. Insulin resistance is typically accompanied by the skin changes of acanthosis nigricans, and proceeds to T2DM in the majority by the third decade. Nearly all demonstrate hypertriglyceridemia. Other findings can include endocrine abnormalities (hypothyroidism, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in males, and hyperandrogenism in females), urologic dysfunction / detrusor instability, progressive decrease in renal function, and hepatic disease (ranging from elevated transaminases to steatohepatitis/NAFLD). Approximately 20% of affected individuals have delay in early developmental milestones, most commonly in gross and fine motor skills. About 30% have a learning disability. Cognitive impairment (IQ <70) is very rare. Wide clinical variability is observed among affected individuals, even within the same family.The clinical diagnosis of Alström syndrome is based on cardinal clinical features that emerge throughout infancy, childhood, and young adulthood. The molecular diagnosis of Alström syndrome is established in individuals of all ages by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in  on molecular genetic testing. No therapy exists to prevent the progressive organ involvement of Alström syndrome. Individuals with Alström syndrome require coordinated multidisciplinary care to formulate management and therapeutic interventions. Red-orange tinted prescription lenses may reduce symptoms of photodysphoria; early educational planning should be based on the certainty of blindness. Obesity and insulin resistance are managed by a healthful, reduced-calorie diet with restricted simple carbohydrate intake and regular aerobic exercise. Myringotomy and/or hearing aids as needed for hearing impairment. Standard therapy for heart failure / cardiomyopathy. Standard treatment of insulin resistance / T2DM as in the general population. Consider nicotinic  derivatives for ; consultation with an endocrinologist if pubertal development and/or menses are abnormal; urinary diversion or self-catheterization in those with voiding difficulties; renal transplantation has been successful in a number of cases; appropriate therapy for portal hypertension and esophageal varices.  Routine assessment of vision and hearing; weight, height, and body mass index; heart (including echocardiography and ECG in all individuals, and MRI in those age >18 years); postprandial c-peptide and glucose and HbA1C starting at age four years; lipid profile; plasma ALT, AST, and GGT concentrations; thyroid function. Twice-yearly CBC, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, cystatin-C, uric , urinalysis. Renal and bladder ultrasound examinations every one to two years if symptomatic and/or if urinalysis is abnormal.  Any substance contraindicated in persons with renal, hepatic, and/or myocardial disease. Therapy directed at one system may have adverse effects on other systems; for example, the use of glitazone therapy in diabetes mellitus is contraindicated in the presence of cardiac failure.  It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk sibs of an individual with Alström syndrome in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt evaluation for manifestations of Alström syndrome, initiation of treatment, and/or surveillance for age-related manifestations.Alström syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. When the  pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.Copyright © 1993-2019, University of Washington, Seattle.

Besides, cholesterol-rich apoB-containing lipoprotein particles (i.e., low density lipoprotein LDL) are key players in progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and are associated with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). So far, lipoprotein particle binding to the cell membrane and subsequent cargo transfer is directly linked to the lipoprotein receptors on the target cell surface. However, our observations showed that lipoprotein particle cargo transport takes place even in the absence of the receptor. This finding suggests that an alternative mechanism for lipoprotein-particle/membrane interaction, besides the receptor-mediated one, exists. Here, we combined several complementary biophysical techniques to obtain a comprehensive view on the nonreceptor mediated LDL-particle/membrane. We applied a combination of atomic force and single-molecule-sensitive fluorescence microscopy (AFM and SMFM) to investigate the LDL particle interaction with membranes of increasing complexity. We observed direct transfer of fluorescently labeled amphiphilic lipid molecules from LDL particles into the pure lipid bilayer. We further confirmed cargo transfer by fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) and spectral imaging of environment-sensitive probes. Moreover, the integration of the LDL particle into the membranes was directly visualized by high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Overall, our data show that lipoprotein particles are able to incorporate into lipid membranes upon contact to transfer their cargo in the absence of specific receptors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30865797>Mendelian Randomization Study of  and Cardiovascular Disease.</a></h2><p>ATP citrate lyase is an enzyme in the cholesterol-biosynthesis pathway upstream of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), the target of statins. Whether the genetic inhibition of ATP citrate lyase is associated with deleterious outcomes and whether it has the same effect, per unit decrease in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level, as the genetic inhibition of HMGCR is unclear.We constructed genetic scores composed of independently inherited variants in the genes encoding ATP citrate lyase () and HMGCR to create instruments that mimic the effect of ATP citrate lyase inhibitors and HMGCR inhibitors (statins), respectively. We then compared the associations of these genetic scores with plasma lipid levels, lipoprotein levels, and the risk of cardiovascular events and cancer.A total of 654,783 participants, including 105,429 participants who had major cardiovascular events, were included in the study. The  and  scores were associated with similar patterns of changes in plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels and with similar effects on the risk of cardiovascular events per decrease of 10 mg per deciliter in the LDL cholesterol level: odds ratio for cardiovascular events, 0.823 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 0.87; P = 4.0×10) for the  score and 0.836 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.87; P = 3.9×10) for the  score. Neither lifelong genetic inhibition of ATP citrate lyase nor lifelong genetic inhibition of HMGCR was associated with an increased risk of cancer.Genetic variants that mimic the effect of ATP citrate lyase inhibitors and statins appeared to lower plasma LDL cholesterol levels by the same mechanism of action and were associated with similar effects on the risk of cardiovascular disease per unit decrease in the LDL cholesterol level.

However, there is no report on how CBX ameliorates hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation in obese mice. In this study, our aim is to explore the mechanism by which CBX regulates lipid metabolism in the liver of obese mice. C57BL/6J mice were divided into three groups and were fed with normal chow diet (NC group) or High-fat diet (HFD and CBX group) for eight weeks. Then mice in CBX group were given CBX every day by gavage for twelve weeks (15 mg/kg). Blood was collected for detection of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Liver tissues were stained with hematoxylin-eosin for histological examination. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for detection of SOCS-3 (Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3), SREBP-1 (Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1), and FAS (Fatty  synthase) protein. The genes of SOCS-3, SREBP-1, and FAS in liver were assessed by real-time PCR. Western blotting was applied to detect the protein expressions of the phosphorylated JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) and phosphorylated STAT3 (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3). Our results showed that compared with the HFD group, serum concentrations of TG, TC and LDL were decreased significantly, while the concentration of HDL was increased in the CBX group. CBX could attenuate intracellular lipid accumulation in the liver. Besides, treatment with CBX could significantly decrease levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-6 (Interleukin 6) and TNF-a (Tumor necrosis factor-a), increase expressions of phosphorylated JAK2 and phosphorylated STAT3, decrease the expressions of SOCS-3, SREBP-1 and FAS in the liver. In conclusion, through activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in liver and reducing the expression of SCOCS-3, CBX could further decrease the expressions of SREBP-1c, FAS and ameliorate the inflammatory state of liver, so as to protecting the liver from lipid metabolism damage induced by high-fat diet. Therefore, CBX has the possibility for the treatment of obesity, , and inflammation.Copyright © 2019.

However, there are serious gaps in our understanding of IL-1 production in atherosclerosis. Herein the authors show that complex plaques, or plaques derived from patients with suboptimally controlled , or on no or low-intensity statin therapy, demonstrated higher recruitable IL-1β production. Generation of mature IL-1β was matched by IL-1α release, and both were attenuated by inhibition of NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 or caspase.

In this study, we investigated the potential improvement of AGR on lipid metabolism using a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced  rats and 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes. The levels of AMPK and its downstream factors were examined by Western blot analysis and real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We observed that ARG lowered the HFD-induced body weight and the levels of serum lipid. Moreover, ARG clearly alleviated fat deposition in the liver and reduced epididymal fat accumulation. ARG also suppressed lipogenesis and lipolysis but promoted fatty  β-oxidation in adipocytes. Most importantly, ARG increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and upregulated the messenger RNA levels of downstream genes related to fatty  β-oxidation, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 and acyl-CoA oxidase 1 but downregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP1c) and their targets, including lipogenesis-related genes such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α, lipoprotein lipase, adipocyte protein 2, and fatty  synthase (FAS), as well as lipolysis-related genes such as adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase. The activity of FAS was also decreased by ARG. We conclude that AMPK activation is important for the pharmacological effects of ARG.

Zinc-α2-glycoprotein (ZAG), a newly identified adipokine, is potentially involved in lipid metabolism. Our previous study revealed that the ZAG content increased after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. To clarify ZAG's possible effects on inflammatory responses and lipid metabolism, we used gene overexpression and knockout mice as models to investigate the function of ZAG during inflammation. The results showed that LPS increased plasma triglyceride, non-esterified fatty  and hepatic triglyceride, while ZAG overexpression decreased these effects. Furthermore, ZAG overexpression weakened inflammatory responses, suppressed lipogenesis, and improved mitochondrial function during inflammation. ZAG overexpression also increased β3-adrenoreceptor, protein kinase A, and phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element binding protein (CREB), promoted the combination of CREB and CREB-binding protein (CBP), and competitively inhibited the combination of nuclear factor-κB and CBP. After ZAG knockout, LPS-induced the  worsened. ZAG knockout aggravated inflammatory responses, promoted lipogenesis, and weakened mitochondrial function during inflammation. ZAG knockout also decreased β3-adrenoreceptor and protein kinase A. The present study demonstrated that ZAG alleviated lipid metabolism disorders by weakening inflammatory responses.

We established a GCC murine model by orthotopicly implanting BGC823 cell line and conducted NMR-based metabolomic analysis of gastric tissues, sera, and gastrocnemius. The model with typical cachexia symptoms, confirmed by significant weight loss and muscle atrophy, showed distinctly distinguished metabolic profiles of tumors, sera, and gastrocnemius from sham mice. We identified 20 differential metabolites in tumors, 13 in sera, and 14 in gastrocnemius. Tumor extracts displayed increased pyruvate and lactate, and decreased hypoxanthine, inosine, and inosinate, indicating significantly altered glucose and nucleic  metabolisms. Cachectic mice exhibited up-regulated serum lactate and glycerol, and down-regulated glucose, which were closely related to  and hypoglycemia. Furthermore, gastrocnemius transcriptomic and metabolomic data revealed that GCC induced perturbed pathways mainly concentrated on carbohydrate and amino  metabolism. Specifically, cachectic gastrocnemius exhibited increased α-ketoglutarate and decreased glucose.

As a medicinal and edible plant,  (L.) Roem (LC) has abundant nutrients that can effectively reduce obesity risk. However, the interaction between the prevention effects of LC against obesity and the modulating gut microbiota of LC remain obscure. This study demonstrated LC supplementation improved high-fat diet (HFD)-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis and significantly enhanced short-chain fatty  (SCFA)-producing bacteria (, ) along with SCFA content accumulation in the gut. Meanwhile, LC supplementation substantially restored gut barrier damage in long-term HFD treatment. Moreover, LC supplementation improved HFD-induced overweight, , insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation. Gene expression profiles showed that LC displayed an important impact on hepatic lipid transport and lipid synthesis (sterol regulatory element binding transcriptional factor 1cperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ signaling pathway). More importantly, an antibiotic treatment experiment demonstrated that the beneficial effects of LC in reducing obesity risk largely depended on the gut microbiota, especially SCFA-producing bacteria (, ). Therefore, LC supplementation improved gut microbiota dysbiosis  enhancing SCFA-producing bacteria (, ), maintained gut barrier integrity, and alleviated the development of obesity.

Here, we report that in the nucleus of hepatocytes, Yes-associated protein(YAP)-the terminal effector of the Hippo pathway-directly interacts with sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP-1c and SREBP-2) on the promoters of the fatty  synthase (FAS) and 30-hydroxylmethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), thereby stimulating their transcription and promoting hepatocyte lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis. In diet-induced diabetic mice, either Lats1 overexpression or YAP knockdown protects against hepatic steatosis and  through suppression of the interaction between YAP and SREBP-1c/SREBP-2. These results suggest that YAP is a nuclear co-factor of SREBPs and that the Hippo pathway negatively affects hepatocyte lipogenesis by inhibiting the function of YAP-SREBP complexes.© 2019 The Authors.

Metabolomics analyses of plasma, liver and kidney in rats were performed using  H-NMR and LC-MS to illuminate the lower blood lipid concentration effect of SDO, and niacin was considered as the active control. The measure of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in plasma showed that SDO treatment decreased significantly the content of TC and LDL-C. An orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis approach was applied to identify the different metabolic profiles of plasma, liver and kidney in rats and to detect related potential biomarkers. The results suggested that the metabolic profiles of the control group and  group showed significant difference and the SDO and niacin group had effective anti- function. The biomarkers primarily concern lipid metabolism, amino  metabolism and glycometabolism, and the change in biomarkers indicated that  could cause the unbalance of these metabolic pathways in vivo. SDO reduced blood lipids by repairing amino  and lipid metabolism.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31152240>Chronic AICAR treatment prevents metabolic changes in cardiomyocytes exposed to free fatty .</a></h2><p>The stimulation of glucose transport by metabolic stress is an important determinant of myocardial susceptibility to ischemia and reperfusion injury. Stimulation of glucose transport is markedly impaired in cardiomyocytes chronically exposed to excess free fatty  (FFA), as occurs in vivo in type 2 diabetes. To determine whether chronic low-grade activation of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) improves substrate metabolism in cardiomyocytes exposed to FFA, isolated cultured cardiomyocytes were exposed for 7 days to FFA ± the AMPK agonist 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR). Glucose transport and glycolysis were then measured during acute metabolic stress provoked by oligomycin. Chronic treatment with AICAR improved basal and oligomycin-stimulated glucose transport in FFA-exposed but not in control cardiomyocytes. Similarly, basal and oligomycin-stimulated glycolysis was reduced in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes but restored by chronic AICAR treatment. Conversely, fatty  oxidation was increased in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes and reduced by chronic AICAR treatment. Chronic AICAR treatment induced in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes the biogenesis of numerous lipid droplets. Curiously, whereas acute treatment of cardiomyocytes with AICAR increased phosphorylation of the AMPKα subunit on T, a classical marker of AMPK activation, chronic AICAR treatment almost completely obliterated T phosphorylation. However, phosphorylation of the AMPK target protein raptor on S was reduced in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes but restored by AICAR treatment. In conclusion, chronic AICAR treatment induces a metabolic shift in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes, characterized by improved glucose transport and glycolysis and redirection of fatty  towards neutral storage. Such metabolic changes in vivo could protect the hearts of patients with type 2 diabetes against ischemia-reperfusion injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30801548></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30991629>Association between Dietary Cholesterol and Their Food Sources and Risk for Hypercholesterolemia: The 2012⁻2016 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.</a></h2><p>It remains unclear whether cholesterol intake can increase serum cholesterol. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the risk for hypercholesterolemia was not associated with intake of dietary cholesterol after adjusting for saturated fatty  (SFA). Based on the data from the 2012-2016 KNHANES, dietary cholesterol was positively associated with the risk for abnormalities in total cholesterol (TC) (odds ratio (OR): 1.153, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.995-1.337;  = 0.028) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (OR: 1.186, 95% CI: 1.019-1.382;  = 0.018) levels before adjusting for SFA; after adjusting for SFA, no significant associations were found between these variables. The mediation analysis showed that dietary cholesterol had no direct effects on the serum levels of TC and LDL-C; in contrast, SFA had significant indirect effects on the association between dietary cholesterol and serum levels of TC and LDL-C. Furthermore, processed meats, but not eggs and other meats, were positively associated with the risk for abnormalities in both TC (OR: 1.220, 95% CI: 1.083-1.374;  = 0.001) and LDL-C (OR: 1.193, 95% CI: 1.052-1.354;  = 0.004) levels.

Bempedoic  (ETC-1002) is a novel low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering agent, currently under trial in hypercholesterolaemic patients.To investigate the tolerability and efficacy of ETC-1002 in hypercholesterolaemic patients through a systematic review of published randomised controlled trials (RCTs).Five databases were searched for RCTs that investigated the safety and efficacy of ETC-1002 in hypercholesterol-aemic patients. The retrieved search results were screened, and then data were extracted and analysed (as mean difference [MD] or odds ratio [OR]) using the RevMan software.Five RCTs (625 hypercholesterolaemic patients) were identified. ETC-1002 was superior to placebo in terms of percent-age changes from baseline in serum levels of LDL-C (MD -26.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] -35.50 to -17.66, p < 0.0001), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD -21.54, 95% CI -28.48 to -14.6, p < 0.00001), and apolipoprotein-B (MD -15.97, 95% CI -19.36 to -12.57, p < 0.0001). When compared to ezetimibe, ETC-1002 was superior in reducing LDL-C (-30.1 ± 1.3 vs. -21.1 ± 1.3). Regarding safety, ETC-1002 did not increase the risk of all adverse events (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.91, p = 0.02) and arthralgia (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.13-0.81, p = 0.02) compared to placebo. All other adverse events including myalgia, headache, and urinary tract infections were similar between ETC-1002 and placebo groups. The evidence certainty in the assessed outcomes was moderate to high except for lipoprotein(a), free fatty , and very low-density lipoprotein particle number (very low certainty).ETC-1002 is a safe and effective lipid-lowering agent and may be a suitable alternative in statin-intolerant pa-tients.

We investigated the effect of amygdalin on the cell death and the level of pro-apoptotic Bax protein and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein in SK-BR-3 human breast cancer cell line. The cell viability of SK-BR-3 cells was evaluated by MTT assay in different concentration of amygdalin. The level of Bax and Bcl-2 in SK-BR-3 cells were measured by western blot analysis. For statistical analysis, One-way ANOVA was used for the comparison of Bax and Bcl-2 protein level and percent of cell viability between groups. The molecular docking studies of amygdalin within the Bcl-2 (PDB ID: 4LVT) and HER2 (PDB ID: 3RCD) active site, were performed using AutoDock 4.2.5. Amygdalin induced a significant reduction of cell viability in SK-BR-3 after 24-h treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Also, amygdalin causes an increase in pro-apoptotic Bax protein and a decrease in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression in the SK-BR-3 cells. Molecular docking studies showed that amygdalin interacts with the active site amino  of Bcl-2 and HER2 through hydrogen bonding and some hydrophobic interactions. Amygdalin can induce apoptotic death in SK-BR-3 cells by increasing pro-apoptotic Bax protein and decreasing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression. The results suggest that amygdalin may be a valuable candidate for the treatment of breast cancer, especially in HER2 positive cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31228804>Novel anti-obesity effect of scutellarein and potential underlying mechanism of actions.</a></h2><p>Scutellarein (Sc), a natural compound and an active ingredient of Erigeron breviscapus (vant.), shows anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and has the potential for obesity treatment. However, no previous in vivo study has been conducted to assess the role of Sc in obesity. This study investigated the effects of Sc on obesity and associated  and fatty liver and explores the underlying mechanisms of action in a mouse model.The study was conducted using a well-established mouse model of obesity induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Anti-obesity effects were assessed using body weight, abdominal circumference, white adipose tissue, adiposity index, and fatty liver index. Lipid lowering and liver protective effects were examined by blood sample analysis. Lipid dystopia deposition was confirmed by liver pathological sections. The signaling pathways of lipid metabolism and cytokine/inflammatory mediator were evaluated using Real-Time PCR and Western blot.Central obesity, dyslipidemia, inflammation, and hepatic steatosis were developed in mice fed with HFD. Administration of Sc at a dose of 50 mg/kg for 16 weeks effectively attenuated all obesity indicators tested. Further studies revealed the antagonistic effect of Sc on  was a result of the repression of the lipid synthesis pathway, de novo pathway, HMGCR, promoting fatty  oxidation (PPARα, CPT-1a) and increased cholesterol output (PPARγ-LXRα-ABCA1). The anti-inflammatory effect was attributed to blocking the expression of inflammatory genes, including TNF-α, IL-6, NF-κB.These results suggest that Sc possesses important novel anti-obesity effects accompanying lipid lowering and anti-inflammation-based liver protective effects. These favorable effects are causally associated with the suppression of gene expression of inflammatory cytokines and fine regulation of genes responsible for energy metabolism. Our results advance the understanding of the pharmacological actions of Sc, and provides a role for Sc in effective management of obesity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Fermented Momordica charantia juice (FMCJ) administration mitigated the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, , and oxidative stress in diabetic rats more favorably than the non-fermented counterpart. Treatments with FMCJ improved ergosterols and lysomonomethyl-phosphatidylethanolamines metabolisms more effectively. Supplement of FMCJ regulated the composition of the gut microbiota, such as increased the abundance of Bacteroides caecigallinarum, Oscillibacter ruminantium, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella oralis, and Prevotella melaninogenica, in diabetic rats compared with untreated diabetic rats. Moreover, FMCJ-treated diabetic rats exhibited higher concentrations of acetic , propionic , butyric , total short-chain fatty  and lower pH values in colonic contents than that in non-fermented juice-treated rats.

The beneficial effects of carob against cancer, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, diarrhea,  and gastro esophageal reflux disease are only a few of its therapeutic actions. Metabolomics-based analysis provides an ultimate tool, for the deciphering of nutritional intervention derived metabolic alterations. In the present study, 16 male Wistar rats were treated with carob powder for a 15-day period. Fecal and urine samples were collected at 5 time points (0, 1, 5, 10 and 15 days). By the applied HILIC-MS/MS method, 63 and 67 hydrophilic metabolites were detected in the fecal and urine samples, respectively, including amino , organic , sugars, vitamins and other endogenous compounds. A clear group separation based on fecal metabolome was observed after 1 day and 15 days treatment, while only a mild differentiation at day 1 was observed based on urine metabolome. Twenty-one fecal metabolites were responsible for the separation including amino  and their derivatives, vitamins and organic . However, only 7 metabolites were altered in rat urine samples. Metabolic alterations in fecal samples could be attributed to physiological and biochemical adaptations derived from the nutritional intervention.

The systemic increase of free fatty  (FFA) due to burn-induced lipolysis and subsequent organ fatty infiltration may culminate in multiple organ dysfunction and ultimately, death. Thus, reducing WAT lipolysis to diminish the mobilization of FFAs may render an effective means to improve outcomes post-burn. Here, we investigated the metabolic effects of Acipimox, a clinically approved drug that suppresses lipolysis via inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Using a murine model of thermal injury, we show that specific inhibition of HSL with Acipimox effectively suppresses burn-induced lipolysis in the inguinal WAT leading to lower levels of circulating FFAs at 7 days post-burn (p < 0.05). The FFA substrate shortage indirectly repressed the thermogenic activation of adipose tissue following injury, reflected by the decrease in protein expression of key browning markers, UCP-1 (p < 0.001) and PGC-1α (p < 0.01). Importantly, reduction of FFA mobilization by Acipimox significantly decreased liver weight and intracellular fat accumulation (p < 0.05), suggesting that it may also improve organ function post-burn.

Metabolism of tryptophan (Trp) via the kynurenine pathway has shown immunomodulatory properties and the ability to modulate atherosclerosis. We identified 3-hydroxyanthranilic  (3-HAA) as a key metabolite of Trp modulating vascular inflammation and lipid metabolism. The molecular mechanisms driven by 3-HAA in atherosclerosis have not been completely elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether two major signalling pathways, activation of SREBPs and inflammasome, are associated with the 3-HAA-dependent regulation of lipoprotein synthesis and inflammation in the atherogenesis process. Moreover, we examined whether inhibition of endogenous 3-HAA degradation affects  and atherosclerosis.In vitro, we showed that 3-HAA reduces SREBP-2 expression and nuclear translocation, and apolipoprotein B secretion in HepG2 cell cultures, and inhibits inflammasome activation and IL-1β production by macrophages. Using Ldlr-/- mice, we showed that inhibition of 3-hydroxyanthranilic  3,4-dioxygenase (HAAO), which increases the endogenous levels of 3-HAA, decreases atherosclerosis and plasma lipids. Notably, HAAO inhibition led to decreased hepatic SREBP-2 mRNA levels and lipid accumulation, and improved liver pathology scores.We discovered that the activity of SREBP-2 and the inflammasome can be regulated by 3-HAA metabolism. Moreover, our study highlights that targeting HAAO is a promising strategy to prevent and treat hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease driven by maladaptive immune responses in the artery wall. Novel insights into cellular processes driving immune cell activation revealed that intracellular metabolic pathways regulate immune cell functions and inflammation.

The cholesterol-lowering peptide (lactostatin: IIAEK) operates via a new regulatory pathway in the calcium-channel-related mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway of cholesterol degradation. The bile  binding peptide (soystatin, VAWWMY) inhibits the micellar solubility of cholesterol in vitro and cholesterol absorption in vivo. VVYP is the most effective peptide having hypotriglyceridemic action in globin digests. The suppressive effect of globin digest on postprandial  has been reported in humans. The ability of peptides (KRES, Apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptides) to interact with lipids, remove LOOH and activate antioxidant enzymes associated with high-density lipoprotein determines their anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic properties. The β-conglycinin derived peptides KNPQLR, EITPEKNPQLR, and RKQEEDEDEEQQRE inhibit fatty  synthase in vitro. These promising findings indicate the need for more conclusive molecular, cellular, and animal and human studies to design innovative new peptides that ameliorate cholesterol and lipid metabolism. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Prevention and amelioration of hypercholesterolemia by dietary regulation are important. Dietary protein and peptides are very useful as regulators of serum cholesterol concentration. Diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol that include soy protein may reduce the risk of heart disease. In Japan, the concept of "food for specified health use" has been introduced for the prevention and treatment of life-style related disease. Thus, peptides derived from food proteins and sources other than food proteins such as peptide-rich functional foods and nutraceutical products, have considerable potential to prevent lifestyle-related diseases, especially , as discussed in this review. Furthermore, various strategies have been used for the efficient screening, development, and application of new hypolipidemic peptides. These include the use of phage display (for anti-obesity peptide), peptide mimetics (for anti-atherogenic peptide), and molecular targets such as CYP7A1 (for hypocholesterolemic peptide) and prohibitin (for anti-obesity peptide).© 2018 The Authors.

Oral administration of MgG notably decreased the blood levels of TC, TG, LDL-C and liver function index ALT and AST of hyperlipidemic rats. The rats supplemented with magnesium showed a huge increase in the GSH-Px and SOD activities, and reduced the heart weight and liver lipid accumulation of high-fat diet fed rats.

Here, we identify the FGF21 signaling in adipose tissues as an obligatory molecular transducer of exercise conferring its metabolic benefits in mice. Long-term high fat diet-fed obese mice exhibit compromised effects of exogenous FGF21 on alleviation of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and , accompanied with markedly reduced expression of FGF receptor-1 (FGFR1) and β-Klotho (KLB) in adipose tissues. These impairments in obese mice are reversed by treadmill exercise. Mice lacking adipose KLB are refractory to exercise-induced alleviation of insulin resistance, glucose dysregulation, and ectopic lipid accumulation due to diminished adiponectin production, excessive fatty  release, and enhanced adipose inflammation. Mechanistically, exercise induces the adipose expression of FGFR1 and KLB via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma-mediated transcriptional activation. Thus, exercise sensitizes FGF21 actions in adipose tissues, which in turn sends humoral signals to coordinate multi-organ crosstalk for maintaining metabolic homeostasis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The early diagnosis of different types of AP and further explore potential pathophysiological mechanism of each type of AP is beneficial for optimized treatment strategies and better patient's care. In this study, a metabolomics approach based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and random forests algorithm was established to distinguish biliary acute pancreatitis (BAP),  acute pancreatitis (HLAP), and alcoholic acute pancreatitis (AAP), from healthy controls. The classification accuracies for BAP, HLAP, and AAP patients compared with healthy control, were 0.886, 0.906 and 0.857, respectively, by using 5-fold cross-validation method. And some special metabolites for each type of AP were discovered, such as l-Lactic , (R)-3-Hydroxybutyric , Phosphoric , Glycine, Erythronic , l-Phenylalanine, d-Galactose, l-Tyrosine, Arachidonic , Glycerol 1-hexadecanoate. Furthermore, associations between these metabolites with the metabolism of amino , fatty  were identified. Our studies have illuminated the biomarkers and physiological mechanism of disease in a clinical setting, which suggested that metabolomics is a valuable tool for identifying the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the etiology of BAP, AAP, HLAP and thus novel therapeutic targets.Copyright © 2019.

The risk of developing such diseases in the diabetic population is relatively high. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent risk factor for premature atherosclerosis. The hallmark of DM dyslipidemia is a demonstrably high level of atherogenic triglyceride rich lipids including very low-density lipoprotein, chylomicrons, and small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Moderate to high intensity statins, targeting LDL cholesterol reduction, remain the cornerstone in the management of this unique disorder. Many 'non-statin' drugs have recently been studied in the DM patients who were either on a 'maximally tolerated statin' or 'statin intolerant'. Ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors are particularly important and were incorporated in the recent guidelines by the European Society of Cardiology, American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and American Diabetes Association. Icosapent Ethyl has garnered huge interest this year following publication of the REDUCE-IT trial. There are several newer hypolipidemic drugs, including Bempedoic , Inclisiran and RVX-208, that are in different phases of clinical trials. In this article, we review the underlying pathophysiology of DM dyslipidemia, existing guidelines related to its management, and the potential of newer hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory drugs being incorporated in the management of DM.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Their chemical composition was characterized by gas and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Both extracts were tested on cultured hepatic and endothelial cells treated to mimic in vitro a multisistemic pathology such as NAFLD. We assayed the effects on lipid accumulation, free radical production, lipid peroxidation, cell migration.Both the total phenolic and the total flavonoid contents were higher in the ethanolic extract. Rosmarinic  was the most abundant polyphenol in TW, while TE was richer in carvacrol. Our findings demonstrated that both extracts ameliorated lipid accumulation, oxidative stress and inflammation in the NAFLD cellular models. However, the aqueous extract was more effective to reduce hepatic steatosis, and the ethanolic extract had higheranti-oxidant potential and wound healing activity.T. spicata extracts could be promising bioactive products to develop natural therapeutic agents or dietary supplements to treat NAFLD and obesity-related metabolic disease.

However, knowledge of these relationships is lacking in children, despite the growing public health problem posed by childhood obesity. The aim of this study was to assess whether plasma-free amino  profiles can serve as useful biomarkers of lifestyle-related diseases in children with obesity.This retrospective study used the medical records of 26 patients (15 male, 11 female) aged 9 or 10 years presenting with moderate to severe obesity and  between April 2015 and March 2017. A degree of obesity of 30% or more was defined as moderate or severe. Amino  levels were compared between obese children with and without impaired glucose tolerance using a t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. In addition, the influence of factors such as intima media thickness, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, amino , and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were analyzed pairwise using Pearson's correlation or Spearman's rank correlation.HOMA-IR was positively correlated with valine, leucine (Leu), isoleucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, threonine, lysine, alanine, tyrosine, glutamate (Glu), proline, arginine, ornithine, total free amino  (all P < 0.01), and aspartate (P = 0.010).

Four weeks male hamsters were divided into 3 groups (n=10). Two hypercholesterolemic groups were fed for 35 days with hypercholesterolemic diet, containing 20% (w/w) wheat gluten or casein. Wheat gluten significantly reduced serum total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations, and also decreased the liver total cholesterol (TC), free cholesterol (FC), cholesterol ester (CE), triglycerides (TG) concentrations. Wheat gluten group had a higher fecal lipids, total cholesterol (TC) and bile  (BA) than that of casein group (p < 0.05). Moreover, wheat gluten significantly increased total short-chain fatty  (SCFA) concentrations in feces. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene revealed that intake of wheat gluten decreased the relative abundances of Firmicutes and Erysipelotrichaceae, but to increased the relative abundances of Bateroidetes, Bacteroidales_S24-7_group and Ruminococcaceae. The lipid lowering properties of wheat gluten was associated with the lower ratio of Firmicutes/Bateroidetes, the lower of the bacterial taxa Erysipelotrichaceae and the higher of the bacterial taxa Bacteroidales_S24-7_group and Ruminococcaceae.

An empirical approach in this regard is to compare the expression profiles of cells under two conditions or tissues from two phenotypes and to unravel the underlying transcriptional regulation. We have proposed the method BASE to statistically infer the effective regulatory factors that are responsible for the gene expression differentiation with the help from the binding data between factors and genes. Usually the protein-DNA binding data are obtained by ChIP-seq experiments, which could be costly and are condition-specific.Here we report a definition of binding strength based on a probability model. Using this condition-free definition, the BASE method needs only the frequencies of cis-motifs in regulatory regions, thereby the inferences can be carried out in silico. The directional regulation can be inferred by considering down- and up-regulation separately. We showed the effectiveness of the approach by one case study. In the study of the effects of polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), namely, docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) diets on mouse small intestine cells, the inferences of regulations are consistent with those reported in the literature, including PPARα and NFκB, respectively corresponding to enhanced adipogenesis and reduced inflammation. Moreover, we discovered enhanced RORA regulation of circadian rhythm, and reduced ETS1 regulation of angiogenesis.With the probabilistic definition of cis-trans binding affinity, the BASE method could obtain the significances of TF regulation changes corresponding to a gene expression differentiation profile between treatment and control samples. The landscape of the inferred cis-trans regulations is helpful for revealing the underlying molecular mechanisms. Particularly we reported a more comprehensive regulation induced by EPA&DHA diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31254945>Respiratory impairment in Niemann-Pick B disease: Two case reports and review for the pulmonologist.</a></h2><p> sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), also called Niemann-Pick disease, is a storage disorder with pulmonary involvement but few respiratory symptoms in adults.

We investigated the role of gravin in the development of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced atherosclerosis and . Five-week-old male wild-type (WT) and gravin-t/t mice were fed a normal diet or an HFD for 16 wk. Gravin-t/t mice showed significantly lower liver-to-body-weight ratio, cholesterol, triglyceride, and very low-density lipoprotein levels in serum as compared with WT mice on HFD. Furthermore, there was less aortic plaque formation coupled with decreased lipid accumulation and liver damage, as the gravin-t/t mice had lower levels of serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Additionally, gravin-t/t HFD-fed mice had decreased expression of liver 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase, an essential enzyme for cholesterol synthesis and lower fatty  synthase expression. Gravin-t/t HFD-fed mice also exhibited inhibition of sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) expression, a liver transcription factor associated with the regulation of lipid transportation. In response to platelet-derived growth factor receptor treatment, gravin-t/t vascular smooth muscle cells exhibited lower intracellular calcium transients and decreased protein kinase A- and protein kinase C-dependent substrate phosphorylation, notably involving the Erk1/2 signaling pathway. Collectively, these results suggest the involvement of gravin-dependent regulation of lipid metabolism via the reduction of SREBP-2 expression. The absence of gravin-mediated signaling lowers blood pressure, reduces plaque formation in the aorta, and decreases lipid accumulation and damage in the liver of HFD mice. Through these processes, the absence of gravin-mediated signaling complex delays the HFD-induced  and atherosclerosis. The gravin scaffolding protein plays a key role in the multiple enzymatic pathways of lipid metabolism. We have shown for the first time the novel role of gravin in regulating the pathways related to the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Specifically, an absence of gravin-mediated signaling decreases the lipid levels (cholesterol, triglyceride, and VLDL) that are associated with sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 downregulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31120107>A renewed focus on GDF11 level fluctuation in human serum in relation to physical examination indicators.</a></h2><p>Growth and differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) is a member of the transforming growth factor β superfamily. Previous studies have shown that GDF11 decreases with age and has anti-aging effects; however, such reports are controversial. We choose 152 subjects covering a large age range (2 hours to 75 years) to measure serum GDF11. Twenty-two hematological variables and 13 biochemical values were measured. Pearson's analysis found a significant correlation between GDF11 and age (p=0.0000, r=0.4898), as well as serum creatinine, uric , triglycerides, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet volume distribution width. GDF11 negatively correlated with aspartate transaminase, WBC count, platelet count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, mean platelet volume, and plateletcrit. Interestingly, we found GDF11 increases in people aged 20-30 years, holds steady in people aged 30-50 years, and increases in people older than 50 years. The results suggest that GDF11 serves different roles along the lifespan. The current actual evidence supports that GDF11 is helpful to promote aging.© The Author(s) 2019.

Subjects with  (n=22) and age-matched healthy controls (n=19) were included in this study. Results showed that plasma levels of Gla-Gas6 protein and VK were significantly lower in hyperlipidemic subjects compared to control. Moreover, Gla-Gas6 levels were significantly and positively correlated with VK (P=.034, r=0.452) and negatively with triglyceride (P=.022, r=-0.485) and total cholesterol (P=.043, r=-0.435) in hyperlipidemic subjects, which suggest that VK supplementation may have a positive effect in activating Gas6 protein and thereby reducing the aberrant plasma lipid levels. Further studies with high-fat diet (HFD)-fed animal model of  demonstrated that VK supplementation (5 μg/kg body weight, 8 weeks) reduced the plasma lipid levels, stimulated both the plasma levels and the hepatic protein expression of Gla-Gas6 protein, and regulated the AMPK/SREBP1/PPARα signaling pathways of hepatic lipid metabolism in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, by using palmitic  (PA, 0.75 mM)-treated both control and GGCX knockdown hepatocytes, this study dissected the direct role of Gla-Gas6 in mediating the positive effect of VK on preventing the PA-induced impaired hepatic lipid metabolism via regulating AMPK/SREBP1/PPARα pathways.

Current dietary guidelines recommend low fat and significantly reduced trans fat intake. Full fat dairy can worsen dyslipidemia, but recent epidemiological studies show full-fat dairy consumption may reduce diabetes and CVD risk. This dairy paradox prompted a reassessment of the dietary guidelines. The beneficial metabolic effects in dairy have been claimed for a ruminant-derived, trans fatty , trans-C16:1n-7 or trans-palmitoleate (trans-PAO). A close relative, cis-PAO, is produced by de novo lipogenesis and mediates inter-organ crosstalk, improving insulin-sensitivity and alleviating atherosclerosis in mice. These findings suggest trans-PAO may be a useful substitute for full fat dairy, but a metabolic function for trans-PAO has not been shown to date.Using lipidomics, we directly investigated trans-PAO's impact on plasma and tissue lipid profiles in a hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis mouse model. Furthermore, we investigated trans-PAO's impact on -induced inflammation and atherosclerosis progression in these mice.Oral trans-PAO supplementation led to significant incorporation of trans-PAO into major lipid species in plasma and tissues. Unlike cis-PAO, however, trans-PAO did not prevent organelle stress and inflammation in macrophages or atherosclerosis progression in mice.A significant, inverse correlation between circulating trans-PAO levels and diabetes incidence and cardiovascular mortality has been reported. Our findings show that trans-PAO can incorporate efficiently into the same pools that its cis counterpart is known to incorporate into. However, we found trans-PAO's anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects are muted due to its different structure from cis-PAO.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

In this study, the combination of serum lipidomic and metabolomic approach was employed to investigate the effect of arabinoxylan on type 2 diabetic rats and identify the critical biomarkers of T2D. Metabolomics analysis revealed that branched-chain amino , 12α-hydroxylated bile , ketone bodies, and several short- and long-chain acylcarnitines were significantly increased in T2D, whereas lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) were significantly decreased. Lipidomics analysis indicated T2D-related dyslipidemia was mainly associated with the increased levels of acetylcarnitine, free fatty  (FFA), diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols, and cholesteryl esters and the decreased levels of some unsaturated phosphatidylcholines (less than 22 carbons). These variations indicated the disturbed amino  and lipid metabolism in T2D, and the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipid species might eventually contribute to impaired insulin action and glucose homeostasis. Arabinoxylan treatment decreased the concentrations of 12α-hydroxylated bile , carnitines, and FFAs and increased the levels of LPCs.

Mechanistic analyses of excess sucrose-induced progression of metabolic syndrome have been focused mainly on abnormal hepatic lipogenesis, and the exact contribution of excess sucrose to metabolic disorders remains controversial. Considering that carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms exhibit clear circadian rhythms, here we investigated the possible contribution of diurnal oscillations to responses of hepatic lipid metabolism to excess sucrose. We found that excess sucrose dose-dependently promotes fatty liver and  in in rats fed a high-sucrose diet (HSD). We observed that excess sucrose enhances the oscillation amplitudes of the expression of clock genes along with the levels of hepatic lipid and carbohydrate metabolism-related mRNAs that increase lipogenesis. We did not observe similar changes in the levels of the transcription factors regulating the expression of these genes. This suggested that the excess sucrose-induced, circadian rhythm-dependent amplification of lipogenesis is post-transcriptionally regulated via the stability of metabolic gene transcripts. Of note, our findings also provide evidence that fructose causes some of the HSD-induced, circadian rhythm-dependent alterations in lipogenic gene expression. Our discovery of HSD-induced circadian rhythm-dependent alterations in lipogenesis at the post-transcriptional level may inform future studies investigating the complex relationships among sucrose uptake, circadian rhythm, and metabolic enzyme expression. Our findings could contribute to the design of chrono-nutritional interventions to prevent or manage the development of fatty liver and  in sucrose-induced metabolic syndrome.© 2019 Sun et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168988>[MicroRNA-29a-3p regulates osteoblast differentiation and peri-implant osseointegration in a rat model of  by modulating Frizzled 4 expression].</a></h2><p>This work aimed to study and identify the influence and target gene of microRNA-29a-3p (miR-29a-3p) in the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in a high-fat environment in vitro and in vivo.1) In vitro: BMSCs were randomly allocated into two groups and were then induced to undergo osteogenic differentiation in a normal or high-fat environment. Next, a miR-29a-3p mimic/inhibitor was transfected into the two groups of cells. The mRNA expression levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Runt related gene 2 (Runx2), and miR-29a-3p and the protein expression levels of ALP and Runx2 were detected before and after transfection through reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot analyses. Moreover, Frizzled (Fzd) 4 was predicted as the target gene of miR-29a-3p by using an online database (Target Scan, MiRNA.org). The interactive relationship between miR-29a-3p and Fzd4 was confirmed through dual-luciferase assays. 2) In vivo: Rats were randomly divided into two groups and fed with a standard or high-fat diet. Titanium implants were grown in rats. Then, the expression levels of miR-29a-3p, ALP, and Runx2 were detected in bone tissues surrounding implants. Moreover, hard tissue sections were subjected to methylene blue- magenta staining and observed under microscopy to study bone formation around implants. In addition, miR-29a-3p-overexpressing lentiviral vectors were transfected into rats, and the expression levels of ALP, Runx2, and miR-29a-3p in bone tissues surrounding implants were detected at 3 and 10 days after transfection.The expression levels of ALP, Runx2, and miR-29a-3p and the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs were suppressed in high-fat groups in vitro and in vivo.MiR-29a-3p plays a positive role in the regulation of BMSCs in a high-fat environment. It can increase ALP and Runx2 expression levels in bone tissues surrounding implants in  models. This result implies that miR-29a-3p can promote implant osseointergration in a rat model of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132462>Alkaloids of dendrobium nobile lindl. Altered hepatic lipid homeostasis via regulation of bile .</a></h2><p>Accumulation of hepatic lipid promotes systemic metabolic dysfunction and results in fatty liver. Our previous studies have shown that the alkaloids of Dendrobium nobile Lindl. (DNLA) could regulate the lipid metabolism gene expression in livers of mice. However, the protective effects on hepatic lipid homeostasis and the underlying mechanisms are still unclear.The C57BL/6 male mice were randomly divided into four groups, including control group, model group, DNLA treatment group, and simvastatin positive control group. Mice in the control group and the other three groups were fed with control diet and high fat diet during the full course of this study, respectively. Hepatic lipid accumulation was induced by HFD in mice after 18 weeks of feeding. DNLA (15 mg/kg) and simvastatin (20 mg/kg) were administrated intragastrically in the DNLA treatment group and simvastatin positive control group for another 18 weeks, respectively. HE staining and Oil-Red-O staining of liver tissues were observed. TC and TG levels in liver were assayed. The amount of major bile  in mice livers were quantified by UPLC-MS. Expression levels of genes were tested by the real-time PCR.The results of HE staining and Oil-Red-O staining showed that DNLA could improve hepatic lipid homeostasis. DNLA significantly decreased liver TC and TG levels in the DNLA group. Moreover, the UPLC-MS analysis showed that DNLA did not only influence the hepatic bile  quantity but did raise the hydrophilicity. Compared with the model group, DNLA decreased the hepatic levels of several free bile , including LCA, DCA, CA, and CDCA, and increased most important taurine-conjugated bile  levels in liver, including TMCAs, TCDCA, TUDCA, and THDCA. In addition, DNLA also decreased the CA/CDCA ratio. The gene expression levels of Cyp27a1, Cyp3a11, Fxr, and Shp were up-regulated in DNLA treatment group.DNLA may improve the hepatic abnormal lipid profile of HFD-fed mice via two pathways: (1) enhancing the taurine-conjugated bile  which are highly hydrophilic and contribute to the excretion of cholesterol; (2) decreasing the CA/CDCA ratio which is positively related to cholesterol absorption.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The effects on hepatic glucogenetic and lipogenic gene expression, systemic metabolism and pathological changes were then determined.In T2DM rats, SIK1 expression was reduced in the liver. Overexpression of SIK1 improved hyperglycaemia,  and fatty liver, reduced the expression of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription co-activator 2 (CRTC2), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), pS577 SIK1, sterol regulatory element binding-protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and its target genes, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty  synthase (FAS), and increased the expression of SIK1, pT182 SIK1 and pS171 CRTC2 in diabetic rat livers with the suppression of gluconeogenesis and lipid deposition.SIK1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism in the livers of HFD/STZ-induced T2DM rats, where it suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis by regulating the SIK1/CRTC2 and SIK1/SREBP-1c signalling pathways. Strategies to activate SIK1 kinase in liver would likely have beneficial effects in patients with T2DM and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30744123>Activation of Lipid Mediator Formation Due to Lipoprotein Apheresis.</a></h2><p>Lipoprotein apheresis reliably reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in patients with atherosclerotic disease and therapy-refractory hypercholesterolemia or elevated lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)). Besides lowering lipoproteins and triglycerides, apheresis also decreases levels of essential omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (6 and 3 PUFAs) in blood plasma. In contrast, heparin-induced extracorporeal low-density lipoprotein precipitation (HELP) lipid apheresis might increase the formation of potentially pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic lipid mediators derived from 6 and 3 PUFAs. The study presented here analyzed lipid mediator profiles in the plasma of patients with  treated by one of three different apheresis methods, either HELP, direct absorption (DA), or membrane filtration (MDF), in a direct pre- and post-apheresis comparison. Using gas chromatography and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) we were able to analyze fatty  composition and the formation of lipid mediators called oxylipins. Our data illustrate-particularly in HELP-treated patients-significant decreases of essential omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  in blood plasma but significant increases of PUFA-derived lipoxygenase-, as well as cyclooxygenase- and cytochrome P450-derived lipid mediators. Given that -3 PUFAs in particular are presumed to be cardioprotective and -3 PUFA-derived lipid mediators might limit inflammatory reactions, these data indicate that -3 PUFA supplementation in the context of lipid apheresis treatment might have additional benefits through apheresis-triggered protective -3 PUFA-derived lipid mediators.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155606>Analysis of amino  profiles of blood over time and biomarkers associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in STAM mice.</a></h2><p>The changes in free amino  (AA) levels in blood during the progression from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are unclear. We investigated serum AA levels, along with biochemical and histological events, in a mouse model of NASH. We induced NASH in male C57BL/6J mice with a streptozotocin injection and high-fat diet after 4 weeks of age (STAM group). We chronologically (6, 8, 10, 12, and 16 weeks, n=4-12 mice/group) evaluated the progression from steatohepatitis to HCC by biochemical and histological analyses. The serum AA levels were determined using an AA analyzer. Serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were higher in the STAM group than in the normal group (non-NASH-induced mice). Histological analysis revealed that STAM mice had fatty liver, NASH, and fibrosis at 6, 8, and 10 weeks, respectively. Moreover, the mice exhibited fibrosis and HCC at 16 weeks. The serum branched-chain AA levels were higher in the STAM group than in the normal group, especially at 8 and 10 weeks. The Fischer ratio decreased at 16 weeks in the STAM group, with increasing aromatic AA levels. These results suggested that this model sequentially depicts the development of fatty liver, NASH, cirrhosis, HCC, and AA metabolism disorders within a short experimental period. Additionally, serum amyloid A was suggested to be a useful inflammation biomarker associated with NASH. We believe that the STAM model will be useful for studying AA metabolism and/or pharmacological effects in NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428354>Structural characterization and hypolipidemic activities of purified stigma maydis polysaccharides.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate structural features and antihyperlipidemic effects of the stigma maydis polysaccharide, termed SMP-1. This polysaccharide was composed of D-mannose, L-rhamnose, D-glucose, D-galactose, L-arabinose, D-xylose, and D-galacturonic , with a molar ratio of 1.00:0.21:1.41:1.44:0.70:0.44:0.56. The SMP-1 was mainly bonded by (1 → 6) and (1 → 3) linkages, with various monosaccharides being evenly distributed in the main and side chains. Moreover, SMP-1 had neither triple-helical structure nor molecular aggregation. Importantly, the SMP-1 could effectively bind the bile  in vitro and significantly lower the total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and moderately increase the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in poloxamer 407-induced hyperlipidemic mice. Moreover, pretreatment with SMP-1 (≥300 mg/kg) could remarkably reduce fat accumulation and restore hepatocyte morphology in the liver of hyperlipidemic mice. Altogether, these findings indicated that SMP-1 could be developed as a safe and effective food supplement for preventing and treating hyperlipidemic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297058>Emodin Induced SREBP1-Dependent and SREBP1-Independent Apoptosis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells.</a></h2><p> (Thunb.) Moldenke (He Shou Wu) has been used for about 20 centuries as a Chinese medicinal herb for its activities of anticancer, anti-, and anti-aging. Previously, we found that He Shou Wu ethanol extract could induce apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and we also screened its active components. In this study, we investigated whether lowering lipid metabolism of emodin, a main active component in He Shou Wu, was associated with inhibitory effects in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The correlation of apoptosis induction and lipid metabolism was investigated. The intrinsic apoptotic cell death, lipid production, and their signaling pathways were investigated in emodin-treated human hepatocellular carcinoma cells Bel-7402. The data showed that emodin triggered apoptosis in Bel-7402 cells. The mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was reduced in emodin-treated Bel-7402 cells. We also found that emodin activated the expression of intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway-related proteins, cleaved-caspase 9 and 3, Apaf 1, cytochrome c (CYTC), apoptosis-inducing factor, endonuclease G, Bax, and Bcl-2. Furthermore, the level of triglycerides and desaturation of fatty  was reduced in Bel-7402 cells when exposed to emodin. Furthermore, the expression level of messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) as well as its downstream signaling pathway and the synthesis and the desaturation of fatty  metabolism-associated proteins (adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, fatty  synthase (FASN), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase D) were also decreased. Notably, knock-out of  in Bel-7402 cells was also found to induce less intrinsic apoptosis than did emodin. In conclusion, these results indicated that emodin could induce apoptosis in an SREBP1-dependent and SREBP1-independent manner in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195146>Hepatocyte peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α regulates bile  synthesis and transport.</a></h2><p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) controls lipid homeostasis through regulation of lipid transport and catabolism. PPARα activators are clinically used for  treatment. The role of PPARα in bile  (BA) homeostasis is beginning to emerge. Herein, Ppara-null and hepatocyte-specific Ppara-null (Ppara) as well as the respective wild-type mice were treated with the potent PPARα agonist Wy-14,643 (Wy) and global metabolomics performed to clarify the role of hepatocyte PPARα in the regulation of BA homeostasis. Levels of all serum BAs were markedly elevated in Wy-treated wild-type mice but not in Ppara-null and Ppara mice. Gene expression analysis showed that PPARα activation (1) down-regulated the expression of sodium-taurocholate  transporting polypeptide and organic ion transporting polypeptide 1 and 4, responsible for the uptake of BAs into the liver; (2) decreased the expression of bile salt export pump transporting BA from hepatocytes into the bile canaliculus; (3) upregulated the expression of multidrug resistance-associated protein 3 and 4 transporting BA from hepatocytes into the portal vein. Moreover, there was a notable increase in the compositions of serum, hepatic and biliary cholic  and taurocholic  following Wy treatment, which correlated with the upregulated expression of the Cyp8b1 gene encoding sterol 12α-hydroxylase. The effects of Wy were identical between the Ppara and Ppara-null mice. Hepatocyte PPARα controlled BA synthesis and transport not only via direct transcriptional regulation but also via crosstalk with hepatic farnesoid X receptor signaling. These findings underscore a key role for hepatocyte PPARα in the control of BA homeostasis.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115752>Prediabetes defined by HbA and by fasting glucose: differences in risk factors and prevalence.</a></h2><p>To investigate, in a sample of nondiabetic adults from a Spanish community, the differences between prediabetes as defined by HbA ("H-prediabetes") and by fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ("F-prediabetes") in regard to prevalence and the influence of potential risk factors, adjusting the latter for confounders.A total of 1328 nondiabetic participants aged ≥ 18 years were classified as normoglycemic, H-prediabetic [HbA 5.7-6.4% (39-47 mmol/mol)] or F-prediabetic (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L). Multivariable analyses were used to compare the impacts of risk factors on the prevalence of H-prediabetes, F-prediabetes and their conjunctive and disjunctive combinations ("HaF-prediabetes" and "HoF-prediabetes," respectively).Some 29.9% of participants were HoF-prediabetic, 21.7% H-prediabetic, 16.3% F-prediabetic and only 8.1% HaF-prediabetic. Whatever the definition of prediabetes, increasing age, fasting insulin and LDL cholesterol were each a risk factor after adjustment for all other variables. Increasing BMI and decreasing mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) were additional risk factors for H-prediabetes; male sex and increasing uric  for F-prediabetes and increasing BMI for HaF-prediabetes. The participants satisfying the compound condition "hypertension or  or obesity or hyperuricemia" (59.9% of the whole study group) included 83.1% of all subjects with HoF-prediabetes.In this population, the most sensitive risk factor for detection of prediabetes was age, followed by fasting insulin, LDL cholesterol, BMI, MCH, male sex and uric , with differences depending on the definition of prediabetes. MCH, an indirect measure of erythrocyte survival, significantly influences the prevalence of HbA-defined prediabetes.

This study sough to explore the effects of corosolic  (CA) in different T2D models and explored the underlying mechanism. Separated from Eriobotrya japonica leaves, CA purity was above 95% measured by a HPLC method. Compared with cAMP and DEX induced T2D HepG2 model, CA significantly stimulated glucose consumption and improved glycogen accumulation by inhibiting PEPCK mRNA expression. And in cAMP and DEX induced T2D zebrafish model, CA reduced glycogen degradation and increased glucose consumption by regulating some key enzymes in carbon metabolism including GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3, LDHA, LDHB, GP, G6Pase, GYS1, and PFKFB3. In addition, insulin receptor signals were also involved in CA-regulated hypoglycemic action. Furthermore, in STZ-induced T2D rat model, compared with diabetic control groups, CA remarkably downregulated the levels of serum lipid, blood glucose, ICAM-1, malonaldehyde and insulin resistance index, while upregulated SOD activity and impaired glucose tolerance. In a conclusion, CA can regulate glucose and lipid metabolic adaptation in T2D like HepG2, zebrafish and rat models partly through reducing inflammation and oxidative stress and suppressing PEPCK.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029479>Altered materno-fetal transfer of 13C-polyunsaturated fatty  in obese pregnant women.</a></h2><p>Maternal obesity at conception is considered a major predictor of offspring obesity. This could by driven at least in part by an altered placental fat transfer. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms involved are not fully understood. We investigated the in vivo materno-fetal transfer of fatty  (FAs) in obese pregnant women using stable isotopes.Ten obese and ten normo-weight pregnant women (control) received orally a bolus of C-labeled FAs 12 h before elective caesarean section: oleic  (C-OA), linoleic  (C-LA) and docosahexaenoic  (C-DHA). Maternal blood samples were collected at -12 (basal), -8, -4, -2, 0 h relative to the time of cesarean section. At the time of birth, arterial and venous cord bloods as well as placental tissue were collected. FAs composition was determined by gas-liquid chromatography and isotopic enrichment by gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry.Maternal plasma insulin and placental weight tended to higher values in obese pregnant women although they did not present serum . Higher concentrations of C-LA and C-DHA were found in non-esterified FAs fraction in maternal plasma of obese mothers. The ratio of placental uptake for C-LA and C-DHA was lower in obese women compared to normal weight pointing toward a limited capacity of FA placental transfer, especially of essential FAs. Maternal insulin was associated to this lower placenta/maternal plasma ratio for both C-LA (R = -0.563, P = 0.012) and C-DHA (R = -0.478, P = 0.033). In addition, the ratio cord/maternal plasma of C-LA was significantly lower in obese women compared to controls.In conclusion, obese mothers without  showed a reduced materno-fetal transfer of polyunsaturated FAs which could affect fetal development.

A drug with a somewhat similar mechanism to statins but free of muscular side effects is ETC-1002 (bempedoic ). It inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis at a step preceding HMG-CoA reductase, i.e. ATP citrate lyase (ACLY). A prodrug, ETC-1002 is converted to the active agent only in liver, not in skeletal muscle, and this may prevent any myotoxic activity. Area covered: The mechanism of ETC-1002 activity is described in detail, considering that ACLY inhibition markedly attenuated atherosclerosis in animal models. Clinical studies are also reported. Expert opinion: Present day LDL-C lowering treatments lead to significant reductions of cardiovascular (CV) events but, at times, the need to interrupt statin treatment appears to be dangerous due to a rapid rise in CV risk. The excellent tolerability of ETC-1002 makes it a useful alternative, either alone or as an adjunct to ezetimibe, for patients with statin intolerance needing to achieve significant CV risk reduction.

Non-esterified fatty  (also known as free fatty , FFA) are especially harmful to the kidneys. A concerted, increased FFA uptake due to high fat diets, overexpression of fatty  uptake systems such as the CD36 scavenger receptor and the fatty  transport proteins, and a reduced β-oxidation rate underlie the intracellular lipid accumulation in non-adipose tissues. FFAs in excess can damage podocytes, proximal tubular epithelial cells and the tubulointerstitial tissue through various mechanisms, in particular by boosting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation, promoting mitochondrial damage and tissue inflammation, which result in glomerular and tubular lesions. Not all lipids are bad for the kidneys: polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) such as eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) seem to help lag the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

LPA metabolism and signaling are implicated in heritable risk of coronary artery disease. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of these processes attenuate experimental atherosclerosis. LPA accumulates in atheromas, which may be a consequence of association with LDLs. The source, regulation, and biological activity of LDL-associated LPA are unknown. We examined the effects of experimental  on the levels and distribution of circulating LPA in mice. The majority of plasma LPA was associated with albumin in plasma from wild-type mice fed normal chow. LDL-associated LPA was increased in plasma from high-fat Western diet-fed mice that are genetically prone to  (LDL receptor knockout or activated proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9-overexpressing C57Bl6). Adipose-specific deficiency of the  gene encoding the LPA-generating secreted lysophospholipase D, autotaxin (ATX), attenuated these Western diet-dependent increases in LPA. ATX-dependent increases in LDL-associated LPA were observed in isolated incubated plasma. ATX acted directly on LDL-associated lysophospholipid substrates in vitro. LDL from all human subjects examined contained LPA and was decreased by lipid-lowering drug therapies.

The latter fuels pivotal biochemical reactions such as the synthesis of fatty , cholesterol and acetylcholine, and the acetylation of histones and proteins. In autotrophic prokaryotes, ACLY is a hallmark enzyme of the reverse Krebs cycle (also known as the reductive tricarboxylic  cycle), which fixates two molecules of carbon dioxide in acetyl-CoA. In humans, ACLY links carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and is strongly expressed in liver and adipose tissue and in cholinergic neurons. The structural basis of the function of ACLY remains unknown.

Such detailed insights will provide the framework for targeting human ACLY in cancer and .

Ezetimibe may be used to supplement statin therapy, or used alone in cases of statin intolerance. Statin-associated side effects do occur, especially muscle symptoms and new onset diabetes, but they do not detract from the benefits of statin therapy. Inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) reduce LDL-C and cardiovascular risk. Evolocumab is subsidised in Australia for patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia when LDL-C is not adequately controlled with maximum doses of statin or ezetimibe or when statin therapy is contraindicated. Fenofibrate reduces triglycerides and cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes when triglycerides are elevated and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is low. A role for dietary omega-3 fatty  and esters in reducing cardiovascular risk remains controversial. All cases of secondary cardiovascular disease prevention merit intensive lipid therapy, unless a contraindication exists. Lipid therapy is justified in cases of primary prevention when absolute risk is high, especially when lipids are highly elevated or when multiple risk factors are present. Clinical management requires a focus on the predominant lipid disorder present, namely hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia or combined . There is an ongoing problem of poor long term persistence on lipid therapy, as well as reduced awareness by practitioners of poor risk factor control.© 2019 AMPCo Pty Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31183867>Cold-pressed Canola Oil Reduces Hepatic Steatosis by Modulating Oxidative Stress and Lipid Metabolism in KM Mice Compared with Refined Bleached Deodorized Canola Oil.</a></h2><p>The quality of canola oil is affected by different extraction methods. The effect of cold-pressed canola oil (CPCO) diet and traditional refined bleached deodorized canola oil (RBDCO) diet on lipid accumulation and hepatic steatosis in mice were investigated. The body weight, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α concentration, serum lipid profile, insulin sensitivity, and oxidative stress were increased in mice fed with CPCO diet, which had higher unsaturated fatty , tocopherols, phytosterols, and phospholipids but lower saturated fatty  than RBDCO, after 12 weeks,. Moreover, CPCO significantly increased tocopherols and phytosterols content in liver and reduced liver cholesterol contents and lipid vacuoles accumulation than RBDCO. Also, serum proinflammatory cytokines, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutary coenzyme A reductase expression level, lipogenic enzymes, and transcriptional factors such as sterol regulatory element-binding proteins 1c, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and fatty  synthase in the liver were also markedly downregulated from CPCO diet mice. Overall, CPCO can reduce lipid accumulation and hepatic steatosis by regulating oxidative stress and lipid metabolism in Kun Ming mice compared with RBDCO. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The results suggested that more bioactive components were contained in cold-pressed canola oil (CPCO) rather than refined bleached deodorized canola oil (RBDCO). CPCO could lower the risk of obesity and , reduce lipid accumulation, and prevent hepatic steatosis. It could be considered as a kind of better edible oil than RBDCO.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31409995>Development and in vitro evaluation of (β-cyclodextrin-g-methacrylic )/Na-montmorillonite nanocomposite hydrogels for controlled delivery of lovastatin.</a></h2><p>  is the elevation of low density lipoprotein levels resulting in fat deposites in arteries and their hardening and blockage.  It is the leading cause of several life threatening pathological conditions like hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes etc.  The objective of this study was to prepare and optimize nontoxic, biocompatible β-CD-g-MAA/Na-MMT nanocomposite hydrogels with varying content of polymer, monomer and montmorillonite. Moreover, lipid lowering potentials were determined and compared with other approaches.  β-CD-g-MAA/Na-MMT nanocomposite hydrogels (BM-1 to BM9) were prepared through free radical polymerization by using  β-CD  as polymer, MAA as monomer, MBA as crosslinker and montmorillonite as clay. Developed networks were evaluated for FTIR, DSC, TGA, PXRD, SEM, sol-gel fraction (%), swelling studies, antihyperlipidemic studies and toxicity studies.  Optimum swelling (94.24%) and release (93.16%) were obtained at higher pH values. Based on R and  value LVT release followed zero order kinetics with Super Case II transport release mechanism, respectively. Tensile strength and elongation at break were found to be 0.0283MPa and 94.68%, respectively. Gel fraction was between 80.55 - 98.16%.

Our goal was to dissect the mechanisms involved. Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on lipid metabolism in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized fatty  9-HODE (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d, 5 days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of 9-HODE and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with oleic . As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and oleic  did not alter de novo lipogenesis but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated mitochondria, prepared from mouse liver, with DE particles and oleic  also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased lipid catabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30937936>Morin reduces inflammatory responses and alleviates lipid accumulation in hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Morin (MO), a natural bioflavinoid, exists in many herbs. Previous studies have acclaimed MO's anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antifibrotic, anticancer, and antihyperglycemic biological effects. This study aimed to assess the molecular mechanism of MO involved in the oleic  (OA)-induced inflammatory damage and lipid accumulation in HepG2 cell and tyloxapol (Ty)-induced  in mice. We found that MO can efficaciously mitigate reactive tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) level and triglyceride (TG) accumulation in OA-induced HepG2 cell and in tyloxapol-induced mice. Next, the study testified that MO apparently suppressed OA-excited nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathways in HepG2 cell. In addition, MO distinctly upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and decreased the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) in OA-induced HepG2 cell and in tyloxapol-induced mice, both of which are dependent upon the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and protein kinase B (AKT). In conclusion, these results suggest that MO has protective potential against  and steatosis, and the potential mechanism may have a close relation with activation of PPARα and inhibition of SREBP-1c.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533200>ω-3 PUFAs Alleviate High-Fat Diet-Induced Circadian Intestinal Microbes Dysbiosis.</a></h2><p>Published data support that fish oil and algae oil rich in ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs) protect against  in mice.

It is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in one of the two ABCG5 and ABCG8 genes encoding the intestinal and hepatic heterodimer ABCG5 (sterolin 1)/ABCG8 (sterolin 2) efflux transporters. These mutations lead to intestinal hyperabsorption and reduced hepatic secretion of cholesterol and plant sterols with subsequent accumulation of phytosterols and cholesterol in plasma and deposition in tissue (xanthoma). Phytosterols are found mainly in vegetable oils, margarine, nuts, grains, soybeans and avocados. Patients with sitosterolemia show extreme phenotypic heterogeneity from almost asymptomatic individuals to those with combined severe hypercholesterolemia at a young age, leading to increased atherosclerosis and premature cardiac death. Early abnormalities include hemolytic anemia with stomatocytosis, macrothrombocytopenia and splenomegaly. In addition to strict avoidance of phytosterol-containing foods, the use of the sterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe, possibly in combination with the bile -binding resin cholestyramine, is the most effective treatment option.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672964>Theabrownin from Pu-erh tea attenuates hypercholesterolemia via modulation of gut microbiota and bile  metabolism.</a></h2><p>Pu-erh tea displays cholesterol-lowering properties, but the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. Theabrownin is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea. Here, we show that theabrownin alters the gut microbiota in mice and humans, predominantly suppressing microbes associated with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Theabrownin increases the levels of ileal conjugated bile  (BAs) which, in turn, inhibit the intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling pathway, resulting in increased hepatic production and fecal excretion of BAs, reduced hepatic cholesterol, and decreased lipogenesis. The inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling is accompanied by increased gene expression of enzymes in the alternative BA synthetic pathway, production of hepatic chenodeoxycholic , activation of hepatic FXR, and hepatic lipolysis. Our results shed light into the mechanisms behind the cholesterol- and lipid-lowering effects of Pu-erh tea, and suggest that decreased intestinal BSH microbes and/or decreased FXR-FGF15 signaling may be potential anti-hypercholesterolemia and anti- therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31207883>Influence of Genetic and Non-Genetic Risk Factors for Serum Uric  Levels and Hyperuricemia in Mexicans.</a></h2><p>Risk of hyperuricemia is modified by genetic and environmental factors.

On the other hand, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by excess lipid accumulation, and inflammatory injury in liver, is becoming an epidemic disease, globally. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the biological role and the underlying mechanisms of TREM-1 in NAFLD. upregulation of TREM-1 occurred in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mice NAFLD model and oleic -treated HepG2 and primary mouse hepatocytes cell model at messenger RNA and protein levels. Functional studies established that overexpression of TREM-1 displayed , and increased in inflammatory indicators and lipid accumulation-related genes, which was ameliorated by knockdown of TREM-1. Our results also showed that obvious lipid accumulation and inflammatory injury occurred in the liver tissue of HFD-fed mice, while treatment with lentiviral vector short hairpin TREM showed marked improvement in tissue morphology and architecture and less lipid accumulation, thus deciphering the mechanism through which knockdown of TREM-1 ameliorated the inflammatory response and lipid accumulation of NAFLD mice through inactivation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and PI3K/AKT signal pathways, respectively. In conclusion, TREM-1/NF-κB and TREM-1/PI3K/AKT axis could be an important mechanism in ameliorating the inflammatory response and lipid accumulation, respectively, thus shedding light on the development of novel therapeutics to the treatment of NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

Vaccarin is an active flavonoid glycoside associated with various biological functions, but its effects on glucose and lipid metabolic disorder in T2DM are still unclear. In this study, glucosamine (GlcN) and free fatty acids (FFAs, oleate/palmitate, 2:1 ratio) were applied to mimic insulin resistance and lipid deposition in HepG2 cells, respectively. Type 2 diabetic mice were induced using a high-fat diet (HFD) together with streptozotocin (STZ). GlcN stimulation was found to upregulate glucose production and gluconeogenesis but downregulate glycogen synthesis and phosphorylation of adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in HepG2 cells, abnormal changes that were reversed by vaccarin. Furthermore, lipid accumulation was enhanced, but AMPK was inactivated in FFAs-exposed HepG2 cells, issues that were rectified by vaccarin treatment. These ameliorative effects of vaccarin on insulin resistance and steatosis were eliminated by AMPK inhibitor Compound C. In type 2 diabetic mice, chronic vaccarin administration decreased fasting blood glucose and lipid levels in both serum and the liver, and improved insulin sensitivity and steatosis in the liver. Taken together, these results suggest that vaccarin attenuates insulin resistance and steatosis by activating the AMPK signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019.

Thirty-six hyperlipidemic probands (6-16 years) on diet therapy were randomized into two groups: the HSO group, receiving 3 g of HSO providing 1.4 g of LA and 0.7 g/day of ALA, and the control group. Both groups received specific dietary guidelines. Before and after the intervention, blood samples were collected and the serum lipid profile, FA composition of RBCs and omega-3-index were analyzed. Eight weeks of supplementation with HSO significantly (p < .01) reduced the RBC content of total saturated and monounsaturated FAs (-5.02 ± 7.94% and - 2.12 ± 2.23%, respectively), increased the levels of total n-3 and n-6 PUFAs (+1.57 ± 1.96% and + 5.39 ± 7.18%, respectively) and the omega-3 index (+1.18 ± 1.42%), but failed to affect the serum lipid profile compared to the control group.

Results showed that oral administration of GFP markedly alleviated dyslipidaemia through decreasing the serum levels of total triglycerides, total cholesterol, and free fatty , and significantly suppressing hepatic lipid accumulation and steatosis. Besides, the excretion of fecal bile  was also promoted by oral administration of GFP. Metagenomic analysis revealed that GFP supplementation (400 mg kg-1 day-1) resulted in significant structure changes on gut microbiota in HFD-fed rats, in particular modulating the relative abundance of functionally relevant microbial phylotypes compared with the HFD group. Key microbial phylotypes responding to GFP intervention were identified to strongly correlate with the lipid metabolism disorder associated parameters using the correlation network based on Spearman's correlation coefficient.

Geniposide (GP) is a naturally occurring iridoid glucoside and is extracted from Gardenia jasminoides Ellis. GP has long been speculated to play a vital role in the treatment of  and fatty liver. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that GP may be importantly associated with the pathophysiology of liver fibrosis. Nevertheless, the fundamental mechanism is yet uncertain. This studywas designed to explore the possible mechanism for the inhibitory effect of GP on CCl-induced mice liver fibrosis. In line with several clinical reports, GP significantly reduced the levels of hyaluronic  (HA), laminin (LN), hydroxyproline (HYP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Meanwhile, liver fibrosis was significantly alleviated by GP as indicated by decreased α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression and type I collagen alpha-1 (Col I α1) deposition. In addition, GP could reduce the cell viability (IC50 = 77.11 and 42.88 μM at 24 and 48 h respectively) and cause G2/M cell arrest of the activated HSC-T6 cells. Noteworthy, GP prominently suppressed the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway and it might inhibit the activation and proliferation of HSC-T6 cells through Shh signaling pathway. Taken together, the current research indicate that GP has a promising antifibrotic effect which could be partially attributed to its suppression of Shh signaling pathway.

However, most previous studies were cross-sectional with the risk of reverse causation, suggesting a need for long-term prospective studies. We examined the relationship of baseline plasma PFAS concentrations with repeated measures of blood lipids. We included 888 prediabetic adults from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and DPP Outcomes Study, who had measurements of 6 plasma PFAS concentrations at baseline (1996-1999) and repeated measures of blood lipids over 15 years of follow-up, and were initially randomized to placebo or a lifestyle intervention. We used linear regression to examine cross-sectional associations of PFAS concentrations and lipid levels at baseline, and evaluated prospective risks of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia using Cox proportional hazard models, and tested for effect modification by study arm. Participants (65.9% female, 57.0% White, 65.9% aged 40-59 years) had comparable PFAS concentrations [e.g., median (IQR) perfluorooctanoic  (PFOA) 4.9 ng/mL (3.2)] with the general U.S. population in 1999-2000. We observed higher total cholesterol at baseline per doubling of PFOA (β: 6.1 mg/dL, 95% CI: 3.1, 9.04), perfluorohexane sulfonic  (PFHxS, β: 2.2 mg/dL, 95% CI: 0.2, 4.3), and perfluorononanoic  (PFNA, β: 2.9 mg/dL, 95% CI: 0.7, 5.0). Prospectively, baseline concentrations of several PFASs, including PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS and PFNA, predicted higher risks of incident hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, but only in the placebo group and not the lifestyle intervention group. For example, participants in the placebo group with PFOA concentration > median (4.9 ng/mL) were almost twice as likely (HR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.25, 2.88) to develop hypertriglyceridemia compared to those ≤median.
