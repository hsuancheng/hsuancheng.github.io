The conditions were optimized to be pH 6, flow rate 2.0mL·min(-1), loading breakthrough volume ⩽5mL, and eluting solvent 5mL. Afterwards, the extracts were analyzed by multi-dimensional mass spectrometry (MDMS) based shotgun lipidomics; 20 species of phosphatidylcholine (PC), 22 species of phosphatidylethanoamine (PE),  species of phosphatidylserine (), and 5 species of phosphatidylinositol (PI) were identified, with content 224.1, 124.1, 27.4, and 34.7μg·g(-1), respectively. The MDMS method was validated in terms of linearity (.9963-.9988), LOD (3.7ng·mL(-1)), LOQ (9.8ng·mL(-1)), intra-day precision (<3.64%), inter-day precision (<5.31%), and recovery (78.8-85.6%). ZIC-HILIC and MDMS shotgun lipidomics are efficient for studying phospholipids in H. nobilis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We developed an LPI that included serum levels of white blood cells (WBC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), albumin, calcium, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), based on the results of a Cox regression analysis. The patients were classified into 3 LPI groups as follows: LPI : normal; LPI 1: one abnormal laboratory finding; and LPI 2: at least 2 abnormal laboratory findings.The median follow up period was 44 months; the median overall survival (OS) and median progression-free survival (PFS) were 11 and 6 months, respectively. A multivariate analysis revealed that the following could be used as independent prognostic factors: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score (ECOG ) ≥2, a high LDH level, serum albumin <3 g/dL, serum calcium>10.5 g/dL, number of metastases>2, presence of liver metastases, malignant pleural effusion, or receiving chemotherapy ≥4 cycles. The 1-year OS rates according to LPI , LPI 1, and LPI 2 were 54%, 34%, and 17% (p<.001), respectively and 6-month PFS rates were 44%, 27%, and % (p<.001), respectively. The LPI was a significant predictor for OS (Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.41; 1.05-1.88, p<.001) and PFS (HR: 1.48; 1.14-1.93, p<.001).An LPI is an inexpensive, easily accessible and independent prognostic index for advanced NSCLC and may be helpful in making individualized treatment plans and predicting survival rates when combined with clinical parameters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29084592>Transcriptional control of enterohepatic lipid regulatory targets in response to early cholesterol and phytosterol exposure in apoE mice.</a></h2><p>An excessive rise in blood lipids during pregnancy may promote metabolic dysfunction in adult progeny. We characterized how maternal phytosterol () supplementation affected serum lipids and the expression of lipid-regulatory genes in the intestine and liver of newly-weaned apo-E deficient offspring from dams fed a chow diet supplemented with cholesterol (.%, CH) or cholesterol and  (2%) (CH/) throughout pregnancy and lactation.Serum lipid concentrations and lipoprotein particle numbers were exacerbated in offspring from cholesterol-supplemented mothers but normalized to chow-fed levels in pups exposed to  through the maternal diet during gestation and lactation. Compared with the CH pups, pups from -supplemented mothers demonstrated higher (p < .05) expression of the primary intestinal cholesterol transport protein (Niemann-Pick C1-like 1) and the rate-limiting enzyme in hepatic cholesterol synthesis (HMG-CoAr), suggestive of a compensatory response to restore cholesterol balance. Furthermore, pups from -supplemented mothers exhibited a coordinated downregulation (p < .05) of several genes regulating fatty acid synthesis including PGC1β, SREBP1c, FAS, and ACC compared with the CH group. These results suggest that maternal  supplementation during hypercholesterolemic pregnancies protects against aberrant lipid responses in newly-weaned offspring and results in differential regulation of cholesterol and lipid regulatory targets within the enterohepatic loop.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25537726>Characterization of (18)F-dipicolylamine (DPA) derivatives in cells infected with influenza virus.</a></h2><p>Bis(Zn-dipicolylamine (Zn-DPA)) coordination complexes represent a new class of synthetic small molecules that can target anionic phosphatidylserine () in the apoptotic cells with high affinity and specificity. In this study, we labeled Zn-DPA and Cy7-Zn-DPA with different (18)F-prosthetic groups and characterized their uptake in A549 cells infected with influenza A virus from the 2009 pandemic (H1N1pdm).DPA was labeled with N-succinimidyl 4-(18)F-fluorobenzoate ((18)F-SFB), 4-nitrophenyl 2-(18)F-fluoropropionate ((18)F-NFP), 2-(18)F-Fluoroethyl toslyate ((18)F-FET), and (18)F-aluminum (Al(18)F), respectively. Cy7-DPA was labeled with (18)F-SFB and (18)F-NFP only. The tracers were reconstituted with zinc nitrate before use. Apoptosis in A549 cells was induced by infection with the H1N1pdm virus for 48 h. Three μCi of each tracer was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C. The effect of different prosthetic groups, different MOI, and incubation time on percent cellular uptake was studied. Cell internalization and efflux was evaluated within 2h of incubation. The competitive binding assay was performed with increasing concentration (10(-12)-10(-5)M) of Zn-DPA or Cy7-Zn-DPA prior to the addition of either (18)F-FB-Zn-DPA or (18)F-FB-Cy7-Zn-DPA into each well. IC50 values for the two Zn-DPA analogues were estimated by GraphPad Prism 6..Among all the four prosthetic groups, the (18)F-SFB method provided the highest conjugation yield for DPA and the highest uptake ratio between the infection cells and the control when both Zn-DPA and Cy7-Zn-DPA were present in the complex. The uptake ratio was similar for (18)F-FB-Zn-DPA and (18)F-FB-Cy7-Zn-DPA. Uptake of (18)F-FB-Zn-DPA and (18)F-FB-Cy7-Zn-DPA was proportional to the degree of apoptosis with a plateau at MOI 3. Uptake of (18)F-FB-Cy7-Zn-DPA also increased over incubation time and reached a plateau at 1h, whereas uptake of (18)F-FB-Zn-DPA did not show any significant change over time. Cell internalization studies showed that more than 70% of (18)F-FB-Zn-DPA remained on the cell surface over a time course of 2 hr in the cell media, but over 90% of (18)F-FB-Cy7-Zn-DPA was internalized within  min of incubation. IC50 values were estimated to be 1.5±.3 nM and 26.2±5.1 nM for Zn-DPA and Cy7-Zn-DPA, respectively.(18)F-SFB was the optimal labeling method for Zn-DPA and Cy7-Zn-DPA with respect to radiochemistry and provided complexes with high target-to-background ratios. (18)F-FB-Zn-DPA and (18)F-FB-Cy7-Zn-DPA appeared to have a completely different internalization mechanism, while Zn-DPA showed higher binding affinity than Cy7-Zn-DPA. Based on these favorable characteristics, (18)F-FB-Zn-DPA and (18)F-FB-Cy7-Zn-DPA should be further evaluated as potential imaging agents for viral infection.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we demonstrate that glucose-induced Cl(-) efflux from β-cells is mediated by the Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channel anoctamin 1 (Ano1). Ano1 expression in rat β-cells is demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Typical Ano1 currents are observed in whole-cell and inside-out patches in the presence of intracellular Ca(++): at 1 μM, the Cl(-) current is outwardly rectifying, and at 2 μM, it becomes almost linear. The relative permeabilities of monovalent anions are NO3 (-) (1.83 ± .10) > Br(-) (1.42 ± .07) > Cl(-) (1.). A linear single-channel current-voltage relationship shows a conductance of 8.37 . These currents are nearly abolished by blocking Ano1 antibodies or by the inhibitors 2-(5-ethyl-4-hydroxy-6-methylpyrimidin-2-ylthio)-N-(4-(4-methoxyphenyl)thiazol-2-yl)acetamide (T-AO1) and tannic acid (TA). These inhibitors induce a strong decrease of 16.7-mM glucose-stimulated action potential rate (at least 87 % on dispersed cells) and a partial membrane repolarization with T-AO1. They abolish or strongly inhibit the GSIS increment at 8.3 mM and at 16.7 mM glucose. Blocking Ano1 antibodies also abolish the 16.7-mM GSIS increment. Combined treatment with bumetanide and acetazolamide in low Cl(-) and HCO3 (-) media provokes a 65 % reduction in action potential (AP) amplitude and a -mV AP peak repolarization. Although the mechanism triggering Ano1 opening remains to be established, the present data demonstrate that Ano1 is required to sustain glucose-stimulated membrane potential oscillations and insulin secretion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25964293>Enhanced biogas production by anaerobic co-digestion from a trinary mix substrate over a binary mix substrate.</a></h2><p>The synergetic enhancement of mesophilic anaerobic co-digestion of trinary and binary mix of organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) + primary sludge () + thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS) as substrates was investigated through batch biological methane potential (BMP) and semi-continuous flow reactor tests. Cumulative biogas yield (CBY) yield for the binary mix of OFMSW:TWAS was 555, 580, and 660 mL/g volatile solids (VS)added for an OFMSW:TWAS ratio of 25:75, 50:50, and 75:25, respectively, which was 48, 78.5, and 140% higher than the calculated expected biogas (CEB) yield from the corresponding individual substrates. The trinary mixture of OFMSW:TWAS: at ratios of 25:37.5:375.5, 50:25:25 and 75:12.5:12.5 was able to produce 680, 710 and 780 mL/g VSadded, respectively, which was 25.5, 62. and 135.6% more biogas than the calculated expected biogas yield from the corresponding individual substrates. Cumulative methane yield (CMY) of trinary mixtures was also higher than the corresponding binary mixtures (20, 27, and 12 % increase for OFMSW:TWAS: at a ratio of 25:37.5:37.5, 50:25:25, and 75:12.5:12.5 compared to the binary mix of OFMSW:TWAS at a ratio of 25:75, 50:50, and 75:25, respectively). Methane content of the biogas varied from 54 to 57%. The results from semi-continuous flow anaerobic reactors under hydraulic retention times (HRT) of , 10 and 7 days supported the results of batch biological methane potential tests. The results were conclusive that enhancement in biogas production was noticeably higher from the co-digestion of trinary mix of organic fraction of municipal solid waste+ thickened waste activated sludge + primary sludge than the binary mix organic fraction of municipal solid waste+thickened waste activated sludge or thickened waste activated sludge+primary sludge with concomitant improvements in VS removal and biodegradability for tri-digestion of organic fraction of municipal solid waste, thickened waste activated sludge and primary sludge.© The Author(s) 2015.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27497855>Fat type in phytosterol products influence their cholesterol-lowering potential: A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs.</a></h2><p>The most common form of phytosterol () fortified foods are fat spreads and dairy products. The predominant fats used are soybean/sunflower (SS) or rapeseed/canola (RC) oils and animal fat (D) in dairy products. This review aimed to investigate whether the carrier fat is a determinant of the hypocholesterolaemic effects of  fortified foods. Databases were searched using relevant keywords and published RCTs from 1990 investigating the effects of dietary  intervention (≥1.5g per day) on total cholesterol and LDL-C were included. After methodological quality assessment and data extraction, a total of 32 RCTs (RC, n=; SS, n=9; D, n=8) were included. As expected, all fat groups significantly reduced TC and LDL-C (p<.01). When compared across different carrier fats, RC as the main carrier fat, reduced LDL-C significantly more than the SS spreads (p=.01). Therefore, a combination of monounsaturated fatty acid rich spread with adequate amounts of omega-3 fatty acids (as evident in RC spreads) may be the superior carrier fat for the delivery of  for optimal blood cholesterol-lowering. The findings of this research provide useful evidence for optimising the hypocholesterolaemic effects of  and support further investigation into the possible mechanisms behind these findings.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The patients had new-onset diabetes during 1999-2005 and were followed up until December 31, 2011. An unmatched cohort of 147,729 ever users and ,676 never users of metformin were identified, and a matched-pair cohort of ,676 ever users and ,676 never users was created by propensity score (). Hazard ratios were estimated by Cox regression incorporated with the inverse probability of treatment weighting using . Results showed that in the unmatched cohort, 713 never users and 3943 ever users developed dementia with respective incidence of 1029.20 and 570.03 per 100,000 person-years. The overall hazard ratio was .550 (95% confidence interval: .508-.596). The hazard ratio for the first (<27. months), second (27.-58.1 months) and third (>58.1 months) tertile of cumulative duration of metformin therapy was .975 (.893-1.066), .554 (.506-.607) and .286 (.259-.315), respectively. Analyses in the matched cohort showed an overall hazard ratio of .707 (.632-.791) and the hazard ratio for the respective tertile was 1.279 (1.100-1.488), .704 (.598-.829) and .387 (.320-.468).

In order to optimize the cytometric sex-sorting procedure, effects of Hoechst33342 staining on the viability and cytometric sorting efficiency of frozen-thawed ram sperm were evaluated. The frozen-thawed sperm were stained with Hoechst33342 at various dye concentrations (80 μM, 120 μM, 160 μM, 200 μM, 240 μM, or 320 μM) for 45 min to evaluate effects of dye dose. The frozen-thawed sperm were stained with 160 μM Hoechst33342 for various durations ( min,  min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, 75 min, or 90 min) to evaluate effects of staining duration. Sperm motility and moving velocity were analyzed using a computer-assisted sperm analysis system (CASAS). Acrosome status, membrane integrity, and distribution of phosphatidylserine () in Hoechst33342-stained sperm were analyzed using flow cytometry after staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled lectin from pisum sativum (FITC-PSA), Annexin V, or propidium iodide (PI). The fertility of Hoechst33342-stained sperm was analyzed by in vitro fertilization (IVF). A high-speed cell sorter was used to evaluate effects of Hoechst33342 staining on cytometric sex-sorting of frozen-thawed sperm. The motility, moving velocity, membrane integrity, and  distribution of Hoechst33342-stained sperm were significantly different from that of immediately thawed sperm (P<.05). However, there is no significant difference existing among the Hoechst33342-stained groups with respect to the above evaluated parameters. Additionally, along with the staining durations, the adverse effects of the staining procedure on sperm showed a steady increase. However, Hoechst33342 staining did not damage acrosome and in vitro fertilizing capability of frozen-thawed ram sperm. Results of cytometric sorting indicated that frozen-thawed sperm can be efficiently sorted into two sperm populations with X and Y chromosome when the Hoechst33342 concentration was 160 μM. Moreover, when the staining duration was equal to or longer than 45 min, the frozen-thawed sperm can be successfully sorted in the presence of 160μM Hoechst33342. In conclusion, Hoechst33342 staining can detrimentally influence viability of frozen-thawed ram sperm except acrosome and in vitro fertilizing capability. Accordingly, the minimum values of Hoechst33342 concentration and staining duration can be set at 160 μM and 45 min respectively. However, the maximum values of Hoechst33342 concentration and staining duration were not determined based on the current study. Further research on how to reduce injuries caused by freezing, thawing, and Hoechst33342 staining on frozen-thawed ram sperm is needed.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In utero tobacco smoke exposure produces somatic growth deficits like intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight in offspring, but it can also negatively influence neurodevelopmental outcomes in later stages of life, such as an increased incidence of obesity and drug abuse. Animal models demonstrate that prenatal nicotine (PN) alters the development of the mesocorticolimbic system, which is important for organizing goal-directed behavior. In the present study, we determined whether intravenous (IV) PN altered the initiation and/or expression of methamphetamine (METH)-induced locomotor sensitization as a measure of mesocorticolimbic function in adult rat offspring. We also determined whether PN and/or METH exposure altered protein levels of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) in the nucleus accumbens, the dorsal striatum, and the prefrontal cortex of adult offspring. BDNF was of interest because of its role in the development and maintenance of the mesocorticolimbic pathway and its ability to modulate neural processes that contribute to drug abuse, such as sensitization of the dopamine system. Dams were injected with IV nicotine (.05 mg/kg/injection) or saline, 3×/day on gestational days 8-21. Testing was conducted when offspring reached adulthood (around postnatal day 90). Following 3 once daily habituation sessions the animals received a saline injection and baseline locomotor activity was measured. PN and prenatal saline ()-exposed offspring then received 10 once daily injections of METH (.3 mg/kg) to induce locomotor sensitization. The animals received a METH injection (.3 mg/kg) to assess the expression of sensitization following a 14-day period of no injections. A day later, all animals were injected with saline and conditioned hyperactivity was assessed. Brain tissue was harvested 24 h later. PN animals habituated more slowly to the activity chambers compared to  controls. PN rats treated with METH showed significant enhancement of locomotor behavior compared to  rats following acute and repeated injections; however, PN did not produce differential initiation or expression of behavioral sensitization. METH produced conditioned hyperactivity, and PN rats exhibited a greater conditioned response of hyperactivity relative to controls. PN and METH exposure produced changes in BDNF protein levels in all three regions, and complex interactions were observed between these two factors. Logistic regression revealed that BDNF protein levels, throughout the mesocorticolimbic system, significantly predicted the difference in the conditioned hyperactive response of the animals: both correlations were significant, but the predicted relationship between BDNF and context-elicited activity was stronger in the PN (r = .67) compared to the  rats (r = .42). These findings indicate that low-dose PN exposure produces long-term changes in activity and enhanced sensitivity to the locomotor effects of METH. The enhanced METH-induced contextual conditioning shown by the PN animals suggests that offspring of in utero tobacco smoke exposure have greater susceptibility to learn about drug-related conditional stimuli, such as the context. The PN-induced alterations in mesocorticolimbic BDNF protein lend further support for the hypothesis that maternal smoking during pregnancy produces alterations in neuronal plasticity that contribute to drug abuse vulnerability. The current findings demonstrate that these changes are persistent into adulthood.© 2016 S.

This Phase I study was performed to establish the safety, tolerability, recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and preliminary clinical activity of ganetespib in previously treated patients with advanced HCC.Patients with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, progression on or intolerance to sorafenib, and ECOG  ≤ 1 were enrolled in a standard 3x3 dose escalation study at doses of 100 mg/m(2), 150 mg/m(2), and 200 mg/m(2) IV given on days 1, 8, and  of each 28-day cycle. Objective response by RECIST version 1.1 criteria was evaluated by CT/MRI every 8 weeks.Fourteen patients were enrolled in this trial and received at least one dose of the study drug. Of the 14 patients: median age, 57 years old; male 71 %; Asian 36 %; HCC etiology (HBV 36 %, HCV 43 %, Hemachromatosis 7 %, unknown 21 %); Child Pugh Class (A 93 %, B 7 %); median number of prior treatments 2; median baseline AFP 70.1 ng/mL. The RP2D was determined to be 200 mg/m(2). The most commonly seen AEs were diarrhea (93 %), fatigue (71 %), AST elevation (64 %), and hyperglycemia (64 %). The most common Gr 3/4 AEs were hyperglycemia (21 %) and lipasemia (21 %). One (7 %) patient had a fatal AE, septic shock, within 30 days of receiving the study drug. One dose-limiting toxicity, grade 3 lipasemia, was observed at the 100 mg/m(2) dose. Pharmacokinetics studies showed a t1/2, CL, Tmax, and Vss of 6.45 h, 48.28 L/h (25.56 L/h/m(2)), .76 h, and 191 L (100.4 L/m(2)), respectively. No objective responses were seen; one patient (7 %) had stable disease at 16 weeks. Median time to progression was 1.8 months, and median overall survival was 7.2 months.Ganetespib had a manageable safety profile in patients with advanced HCC who had progressed on at least one line of systemic therapy. The pharmacokinetic profile showed that ganetespib exposure in patients with mild hepatic dysfunction is similar to that seen in patients with normal liver function.

Both strains were observed to form vegetative hyphae in the early phase of growth but the hyphae eventually fragment into short rods to coccoid cells. The peptidoglycan type of both strains was found to be A4α. Their predominant menaquinone was identified as MK-9(H4) and the major fatty acid as anteiso-C(:). The DNA G+C content was determined to be 68.4-68.5 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that strains -14-16(T) and RS-7-1 were related to members of the family Cellulomonadaceae. Their nearest phylogenetic neighbour was found to be Sediminihabitans luteus, which is currently the only species of the genus Sediminihabitans, with a similarity of 97.94%. However, strains -14-16(T) and RS-7-1 were distinguishable from the members of the genus Sediminihabitans and the other genera within the family Cellulomonadaceae in terms of chemotaxonomic characteristics and phylogenetic relationship. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization experiments indicated that strains -14-16(T) and RS-7-1 belong to the same species.

The behavior of fish was accurately recorded by video behavior tracking technology. Results showed that changes in behavior (e.g. cluster, the reduction of swimming speed and range of movement) were significantly greater in -μm -exposed fish, which may affect hunting behavior and exploration competence. Oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion of fish was significantly greater in -μm  treatment than in .5-μm  treatment, suggesting respiration and  stress. Moreover, the abnormal behavior, respiration and ammonia excretion of -exposed fish had recovered modestly. In addition, abnormal symptoms of bile, liver and lumen of intestine were detected in -μm  exposure. Importantly, the growth and gross energy of fish were reduced in -μm  exposure than .5-μm  exposure. Both .5-μm and -μm  exposures led to significantly lower protein and lipid contents, suggesting energy reserve and nutrition quality reduction of fish. Overall, microplastics had the negative impact at greater levels than nanoplastics. Altered behavior, energy reserve and nutritional quality of fish indicated the potential risk on biological functions, the development of fishery and food safety.Copyright © 2019.

However, less is known about its effect on laying hen performance. Therefore, 6 diets were formulated to produce differing ratios (:100, 20:80, 40:60, 60:40, 80:20, and 100:) of semi-purified wheat starch (rapidly digested) and pea starch (; slowly digested). Each diet was fed to 120 conventionally caged Lohmann LSL lite hens in groups of 12, from 27 to 46 wk of age, and its effects on performance and feather covering were assessed. Data were analyzed by regression analysis, and the significance level was chosen at P ≤ .05. Hen-day egg production (HDP) was high (97.05%) and unaffected by  concentration for  to 10 wk of the trial, followed by a quadratic-shaped HDP, with an estimated maximum at 67%  concentration, for the 10 to 20 wk period of the trial. Overall ( to 20 wk), HDP increased linearly with . No effect on egg weight was found (average weight = 59.6±2.1 g), but eggshells were thickest at the 55%  concentration. Body weight gain was affected by  concentration and maximized at 49% . Body weight uniformity and mortality were not affected by dietary treatment. Feed intake increased linearly with  from 102 to 109 g/hen/d, while feed: egg mass ratio was minimal at 26% . Using a scale from 1 to 4 per body part (neck, wings, back, vent and breast), only neck feather cover increased linearly with , from 3. (% ) to 3.2/4 (100% ). However, back and total feather coverage showed a trend (P = .054 and P = .079 respectively) to increase linearly with  as well (from 3.7 to 3.9/4 and .6 to 16.6/20, respectively). In summary, feeding  at low to intermediate concentrations improved laying hen performance. Further research should focus on the mechanisms involved in this effect.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25641780>Protamine sulfate precipitation method depletes abundant plant seed-storage proteins: A case study on legume plants.</a></h2><p>Depletion of abundant proteins is one of the effective ways to improve detection and identification of low-abundance proteins. Our previous study showed that protamine sulfate precipitation (PSP) method can deplete abundant ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) from leaf proteins and is suitable for their in-depth proteome investigation. In this study, we provide evidence that the PSP method can also be effectively used for depletion of abundant seed-storage proteins (SSPs) from the total seed proteins of diverse legume plants including soybean, broad bean, pea, wild soybean, and peanut. The .05% protamine sulfate () was sufficient to deplete major SSPs from all legumes tested except for peanut where .1%  was required. SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and 2DE analyses of -treated soybean and peanut seed proteins showed enriched spots in -supernatant than total proteins. Coefficient of variation percentage (%CV) and principal component analysis of 2DE spots support the reproducibility, suitability, and efficacy of the PSP method for quantitative and comparative seed proteome analysis. MALDI-TOF-TOF successfully identified some protein spots from soybean and peanut. Hence, this simple, reproducible, economical PSP method has a broader application in depleting plant abundant proteins including SSPs in addition to RuBisCO, allowing discussion for comprehensive proteome establishment and parallel comparative studies in plants.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The present systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies was undertaken to summarize the association between abdominal obesity and the risk of hip fracture. We searched online databases for relevant publications up to February 2017, using relevant keywords. In total, 14 studies were included in the systematic review and 9 studies, with a total sample size of 295,674 individuals (129,964 men and 165,703 women), were included in the meta-analysis. Participants were apparently healthy and aged ≥40 y. We found that abdominal obesity (defined by various waist-hip ratios) was positively associated with the risk of hip fracture (combined RR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.46,  = .01). Combining 8 effect sizes from 6 studies, we noted a marginally significant positive association between abdominal obesity (defined by various waist circumferences) and the risk of hip fracture (combined RR: 1.36; 95% CI: .97, 1.89,  = .07). This association became significant in a fixed-effects model (combined effect size: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.25, 1.58,  < .001). Based on 5 effect sizes, we found that a .1-U increase in the waist-hip ratio was associated with a 16% increase in the risk of hip fracture (combined RR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.29,  = .007), whereas a 10-cm increase in waist circumference was not significantly associated with a higher risk of hip fracture (combined RR: 1.13, 95% CI: .94, 1.36,  = .19). This association became significant, however, when we applied a fixed-effects model (combined effect size: 1.21, 95% CI: 1., 1.27,  < .001). We found that abdominal obesity was associated with a higher risk of hip fracture in 295,674 individuals. Further studies are needed to test whether there are associations between abdominal obesity and fractures at other bone sites.© 2017 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26502350>Ultrafast Dynamics of Long Homologues of Carotenoid Zeaxanthin.</a></h2><p>Three zeaxanthin homologues with conjugation lengths N of , 19, and 23 denoted as Z15, Z19, and Z23 were studied by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, and the results were compared to those obtained for zeaxanthin (Z11). The energies of S2 decrease from 20 450 cm(-1) (Z11) to 18 280 cm(-1) (Z15), 17 095 cm(-1) (Z19), and 16 560 cm(-1) (Z23). Fitting the N dependence of the S2 energies allowed the estimation of [Formula: see text], the S2 energy of a hypothetical infinite zeaxanthin, to be ∼14 000 cm(-1). Exciting the - band of the S2 state produces characteristic S1-Sn spectral profiles in transient absorption spectra with maxima at 556 nm (Z11), 630 nm (Z15), 690 nm (Z19), and 740 nm (Z23). The red shift of the S1-Sn transition with increasing conjugation length is caused by a decrease in the S1 state energy, resulting in S1 lifetimes of 9  (Z11), .9  (Z15), .35  (Z19), and .19  (Z23). Essentially the same lifetimes were obtained after excess energy excitation at 400 nm, but S1-Sn becomes broader, indicating a larger conformation disorder in the S1 state after 400 nm excitation compared to excitation into the - band of the S2 state. An S* signal was observed in all samples, but only for Z15, Z19, and Z23 does the S* signal decay with a lifetime different from that of the S1 state. The S* lifetimes are 2.9 and 1.6  for Z15 and Z19, respectively. In Z23 the S* signal needs two decay components yielding lifetimes of .24 and 2.3 . The S* signal is more pronounced after 400 nm excitation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28495594>Elevated μs-ms timescale backbone dynamics in the transition state analog form of arginine kinase.</a></h2><p>Arginine kinase catalyzes reversible phosphoryl transfer between arginine and ATP. Crystal structures of arginine kinase in an open, substrate-free form and closed, transition state analog (TSA) complex indicate that the enzyme undergoes substantial domain and loop rearrangements required for substrate binding, catalysis, and product release. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has shown that substrate-free arginine kinase is rigid on the -ns timescale (average S=.84±.08) yet quite dynamic on the µs-ms timescale (35 residues with R, 12%), and that movements of the N-terminal domain and the loop comprising residues I182-G209 are rate-limiting on catalysis. Here, NMR of the TSA-bound enzyme shows similar rigidity on the -ns timescale (average S=.91±.05) and substantially increased μs-ms timescale dynamics (77 residues; 22%). Many of the residues displaying μs-ms dynamics in NMR Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) N backbone relaxation dispersion experiments of the TSA complex are also dynamic in substrate-free enzyme. However, the presence of additional dynamic residues in the TSA-bound form suggests that dynamics extend through much of the C-terminal domain, which indicates that in the closed form, a larger fraction of the protein takes part in conformational transitions to the excited state(s). Conformational exchange rate constants (k) of the TSA complex are all approximately 2500s, higher than any observed in the substrate-free enzyme (800-1900s). Elevated μs-ms timescale protein dynamics in the TSA-bound enzyme is more consistent with recently postulated catalytic networks involving multiple interconnected states at each step of the reaction, rather than a classical single stabilized transition state.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Given the role of PAX6 in pineal development and circadian regulation, adolescents with PAX6+/- may experience sleep-wake disturbances. The purpose of this observational study was to explore sleep-related phenotypes in adolescents with PAX6+/-.This study compared sleep phenotypes of nine subjects with PAX6+/- (aged 10-19 years) with previously published data on healthy adolescents ( n = 25, aged 10-18 years). Subjects completed the Cleveland Adolescent Sleepiness Questionnaire (CASQ), Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sleep Disturbance (v. 1.; 8a), and PROMIS Sleep-Related Impairment (v. 1.; 8b) Questionnaires and wore actigraphs for seven nights to record sleep patterns.Total CASQ, PROMIS sleep-related impairment, and PROMIS sleep disturbance scores were not statistically different between the groups (  > .). Actigraph data for lights off to sleep-onset time were found to be significantly higher in subjects with PAX6+/- versus the healthy comparison group (adjusted mean [95% confidence interval]: 20.1 min [8.1, 49.8] vs. 6.2 min [3.7, 10.4], respectively, p = .04).Both adolescents with PAX6+/- and the healthy comparison group on average slept less than 8 hr/night, and overall sleep deprivation in adolescents may have masked differences between groups. This study used rare genetic disorders with biological vulnerability to sleep problems as a genotype-phenotype model.

MicroRNA-31 (miR-31) plays an oncogenic role and is associated with BRAF mutation and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer. EZH2 is functionally considered to suppress miR-31 expression in human cancers; however, no study has reported its relationship with colon cancer. We therefore evaluated EZH2 expression using immunohistochemistry and assessed miR-31 and epigenetic alterations using 301 colorectal carcinomas and 207 premalignant lesions. Functional analysis was performed to identify the association between EZH2 and miR-31 using cancer cell lines. In the current study, negative, weak, moderate, and strong EZH2 expressions were observed in %, 19%, 25%, and 41% of colorectal cancers, respectively. EZH2 was inversely associated with miR-31 (P < .0001), independent of clinicopathological and molecular features. In a multivariate stage-stratified analysis, high EZH2 expression was related to favorable prognosis (P = .0022). Regarding premalignant lesions, negative EZH2 expression was frequently detected in sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/) (76%; P < .0001) compared with hyperplastic polyps, traditional serrated adenomas, and non-serrated adenomas (25-36%). Functional analysis demonstrated that the knockdown of EZH2 increased miR-31 expression. In conclusion, an inverse association was identified between EZH2 and miR-31 in colorectal cancers. Our data also showed that upregulation of EZH2 expression may be rare in SSA/. These results suggest that EZH2 suppresses miR-31 in colorectal cancer and may correlate with differentiation and evolution of serrated pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169656>Altered Bile Transporter Expression and Cholesterol  in Children With Cholesterol and Pigment Gallstones.</a></h2><p>We elucidated pathophysiology of pediatric gallstone disease by assessing liver expression of bile transporters in relation to bile acids and surrogates of cholesterol absorption and synthesis in serum and gallstones.RNA expression of canalicular bile transporters in liver biopsies from 32 pediatric gallstone patients and from 6 liver donors (controls) was measured by qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). Concentrations of cholesterol and precursors, plant sterols and bile acids in gallstones, and in serum of the patients and 82 healthy children were measured. Primary outcomes were the difference in RNA expressions and serum sterol profiles between patients and controls.Cholesterol stones (CS; n = ) contained cholesterol >42% and pigment stones (; n = 17) <9% of weight. CS patients had markedly lower serum plant sterols (absorption) and higher cholesterol precursors (synthesis) than  patients or healthy controls. CS contained several times more cholesterol precursors and less plant sterols relative to cholesterol than , which were enriched by primary bile acids (12-5.2-fold, P < .001). Liver RNA expression of ABCG5/G8 was similarly increased 2.5- to 1.8-fold (P < .002) in CS and  patients, whereas  patients had higher ABCB11 expression (P < .05). In  bile acid concentration correlated with gallstone plant sterols (R = .83, P < .0001), and ABCG5 expression with ABCB11 expression (R = .27, P = .03).In CS, upregulation of ABCG5/G8 expression associates with low absorption and high gallstone content of cholesterol.

To study the effectiveness of PDT mediated by a novel photosensitizer (), DTPP 5-(4'-(2″-dicarboxymethylamino)acetamidophenyl)-10, , 20-triphenylporphyrin, on lung cancer A549 cell lines in vitro, DTPP was employed in different concentrations (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, , 20, 25, and 30 μg/ml) and combined with 650 nm laser of different power densities (.6, 1.2, 2.4, 4.8, 7.2, and 9.6 J/cm(2)) that resulted in obvious inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Results showed that cell survival rates have a dependent relationship with time and  concentrations and no significant cytotoxicity was induced by DTPP itself. Apoptosis and cell cycle S arrest were observed; cytoskeleton morphologic observation revealed collapse, sparkling, and shrunken shapes. Apoptosis-related protein caspase-3 overexpression was detected while caspase-9, bcl-2, and cytoskeleton protein beta-catenin were in low levels of expression than the control. Cleavage of beta-catenin by caspase-3 or other proteases from the lysosome might be the main reason for the cytoskeleton collapse as beta-tubulin and actin were at a stable level 12 h after PDT.

To obtain a better understanding of the microbial ecology of biofouling process, this study conducted rigorous, time-course analyses on the structure, EPS and microbial composition of the fouling layer developed on ultrafiltration membranes in a nitrification bioreactor. During a 14-day fouling event, three phases were determined according to the flux decline and microbial succession patterns. In Phase I (-2 days), small sludge flocs in the bulk liquid were selectively attached on membrane surfaces, leading to the formation of similar EPS and microbial community composition as the early biofilms. Dominant populations in small flocs, e.g., Nitrosomonas, Nitrobacter, and Acinetobacter spp., were also the major initial colonizers on membranes. In Phase II (2-4 d), fouling layer structure, EPS composition, and bacterial community went through significant changes. Initial colonizers were replaced by fast-growing and metabolically versatile heterotrophs (e.g., unclassified Sphingobacteria). The declining EPS polysaccharide to protein (:PN) ratios could be correlated well with the increase in microbial community diversity. In Phase III (5-14 d), heterotrophs comprised over 90% of the community, whereas biofilm structure and EPS composition remained relatively stable. In all phases, AOB and NOB were constantly found within the top 40% of the fouling layer, with the maximum concentrations around % from the top. The overall microbial succession pattern from autotrophic colonization to heterotrophic domination implied that MBR biofouling could be alleviated by forming larger bacterial flocs in bioreactor suspension (reducing autotrophic colonization), and by designing more specific cleaning procedures targeting dominant heterotrophs during typical filtration cycles.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Several functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with CYP1B1 expression and activity. The objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the correlation of CYP1B1 SNPs with the outcome of NSCLC patients treated with docetaxel in second or third line.Associations between CYP1B1 4326C>G and 4390A>G polymorphisms with response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Pearson χ(2) test, Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test; a multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards modeling.A total of 65 advanced NSCLC patients were enrolled into the analysis. Median age was 66 years (range 46-81). Forty-nine patients were male; only five were never smokers. Performance status () was  in 25 patients, 1 in 28 and 2 in 12. Histology was adenocarcinoma in 28 patients, squamous carcinoma in 22, other NSCLC in the remaining . At univariate analysis, stage and CYP1B1 4326C>G SNPs are associated with PFS, while  and CYP1B1 4326C>G SNPs correlated with OS. In particular, patients with CYP1B1 4326-GG genotype had shorter PFS and OS than patients with other genotypes (PFS 1.80 vs. 2.70 months, p = .12; OS 3.63 vs. 9.83 months, p = .039). CYP1B1 4326C>G SNPs were also associated with response rate. Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent prognostic/predictive role of CYP1B1 4326C>G SNPs on OS (p = .042) with only a trend for PFS (p = .083).CYP1B1 4326C>G polymorphism emerged as possible prognostic/predictive marker of activity and efficacy of docetaxel in NSCLC patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30150671>Evolutionary specialization of MscCG, an MscS-like mechanosensitive channel, in amino acid transport in Corynebacterium glutamicum.</a></h2><p>MscCG, a mechanosensitive channel of Corynebacterium glutamicum provides a major export mechanism for glutamate in this Gram-positive bacterium, which has for many years been used for industrial production of glutamate and other amino acids. The functional characterization of MscCG is therefore, of great significance to understand its conductive properties for different amino acids. Here we report the first successful giant spheroplast preparation of C. glutamicum amenable to the patch clamp technique, which enabled us to investigate mechanosensitive channel activities of MscCG in the native membrane of this bacterium. Single channel recordings from these spheroplasts revealed the presence of three types of mechanosensitive channels, MscCG, MscCG2, and CgMscL, which differ largely from each other in their conductance and mechanosensitivity. MscCG has a relatively small conductance of ~340  followed by an intermediate MscCG2 conductance of ~1. nS and comparably very large conductance of 3.7 nS exhibited by CgMscL. By applying Laplace's law, we determined that very moderate membrane tension of ~5.5 mN/m was required for half activation of MscCG compared to ~12 mN/m required for half activation of both MscCG2 and CgMscL. Furthermore, by combining the micropipette aspiration technique with molecular dynamics simulations we measured mechanical properties of the C. glutamicum membrane, whose area elasticity module of K ≈  mN/m is characteristic of a very soft membrane compared to the three times larger area expansion modulus of K ≈ 44 mN/m of the more elastic E. coli membrane. Moreover, we demonstrate that the "soft" properties of the C. glutamicum membrane have a significant impact on the MscCG gating characterized by a strong voltage-dependent hysteresis in the membrane of C. glutamicum compared to a complete absence of the hysteresis in the E. coli cell membrane. We thus propose that MscCG has evolved and adapted as an MscS-like channel to the mechanical properties of the C. glutamicum membrane enabling the channel to specialize in transport of amino acids such as glutamate, which are major osmolytes helping the bacterial cells survive extreme osmotic stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30680757>Altered profile of circulating microparticles in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.</a></h2><p>Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and it is associated with the prothrombotic state. Circulating microparticles (cMPs) are membrane vesicles that are shed from many cell types in response to cell activation and cell apoptosis. Several studies reported that cMPs may play a role in the hypercoagulable state that can be observed in patients with AF. The aim of this study was to determine the levels of total cMPs and characterize their cellular origins in AF patients.Atotal of 66 AF patients and 33 healthy controls were enrolled. This study investigated total cMP levels and their cellular origin in AF patients using polychromatic flow cytometry.AF patients had significantly higher levels of total cMPs (median 36.38, interquartile range [IQR] 21.16-68.50 × 10 counts/mL vs median .21, IQR 9.91-30.86 × 10 counts/mL; P = .004), platelet-derived MPs (PMPs) (median 10.61, IQR 6.55-18.04 × 10 counts/mL vs median 7.83, IQR 4.44-10.26 × 10/mL; P = .009), and endothelial-derived MPs (EMPs CD31+ CD41-) (median 2.94, IQR 1.78-.60 × 10 counts/mL vs median 1.16, IQR .71-2.30 × 10 counts/mL; P = .001) than healthy controls after adjusting for potential confounders. Phosphatidylserine positive MP ( + MP) levels were similar compared between AF patients and healthy controls.The results of this study revealed a marked increase in total cMP levels, and evidence of elevated endothelial damage and platelet activation, as demonstrated by increased PMP and EMP levels, in AF patients.

This inter-organ correlation between the GIT and the pancreas was assessed through a rat model. Separate local irradiation to the abdomen and the pelvis was applied concurrently for 8-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats. Abdominal irradiation was categorized into pancreatic shield () and non-pancreatic shield (NPS) irradiation. After 5 Gy and  Gy irradiation, the rectal mucosa was analyzed at the first week (early phase, Ep) and the 14th week (late phase, Lp). A slow gain in body weight was observed initially, particularly in the NPS group receiving a  Gy dose (P < .001). The large number of apoptotic bodies after  Gy at Ep decreased at Lp. At Ep for the 5-Gy group, the NPS group revealed more fibrotic change than the  group (P = .002). Cleaved caspase-3 (CCP3) expression was greater at Lp, and the Ep-Lp increase was prominent in the NPS--Gy group (P = .010). At Lp, for  Gy irradiation, CCP3 was expressed more in the NPS group than in the  group (P = .032). Despite no direct toxicity difference between the  and NPS groups, small changes in parameters such as fibrosis or CCP3 expression suggest that pancreatic shielding does have an effect on the radiation response in the rectal mucosa, which suggests a need for a multi-organ effect-based approach in GIT radiotoxicity assessment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26345866>Effect of phosphatidylserine on memory in patients and rats with Alzheimer's disease.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of phosphatidylserine () on memory of patients and rats with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In total, 57 AD patients were recruited from our hospital, and were divided into two groups: 25 in the control group and 32 in the observation group. Next, 300 mg/d of  was given to the rats in the observation group for 12 continuous weeks based on the control group. AD rats were divided into three groups: control group,  30 mg/kg group, and   mg/kg group. Learning memory ability and free radical levels in the brain were detected after treatment. In AD patients, vocabulary and picture matching scores in the two treatment groups increased after treatment (P < .05). Moreover, the scores in the treated group were significantly greater than the control group (P < .05). In AD rats,  treatment reduced the escape latent period of AD rats, increased SOD and OH(-), and decreased acetylcholinesterase levels (P < .05). Compared with   mg/kg,  30 mg/kg group was significantly more efficacious (P < .05). Compared with the AD model group, hippocampal cells showed normal arrangement, karyopyknosis decreased, and the pathological changes in the two  groups were considerable. In conclusion,  decreased cholinesterase, improved memory, and improved hippocampal inflammation injury in AD brains by increasing SOD and OH(-) levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27943293>Foscan and foslip based photodynamic therapy in osteosarcoma in vitro and in intratibial mouse models.</a></h2><p>Current osteosarcoma therapies cause severe treatment-related side effects and chemoresistance, and have low success rates. Consequently, alternative treatment options are urgently needed. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a minimally invasive, local therapy with proven clinical efficacy for a variety of tumor types. PDT is cytotoxic, provokes anti-vascular effects and stimulates tumor cell targeting mechanisms of the immune system and, consequently, has potential as a novel therapy for osteosarcoma patients. This study investigated the uptake and the dark- and phototoxicity and cytotoxic mechanisms of the photosensitizer () 5,10,,20-tetrakis(meta-hydroxyphenyl) chlorine (mTHPC, Foscan) and a liposomal mTHPC formulation (Foslip) in the human 143B and a mouse K7M2-derived osteosaroma cell line (K7M2L2) in vitro. Second, the tumor- and metastasis-suppressive efficacies of mTHPC formulations based PDT and associated mechanisms in intratibial, metastasizing osteosarcoma mouse models (143B/SCID and syngeneic K7M2L2/BALB/c) were studied. The uptake of Foscan and Foslip in vitro was time- and dose-dependent and resulted in mTHPC and light dose-dependent phototoxicity associated with apoptosis. In vivo, the uptake of both i.v. administered mTHPC formulations was higher in tumor than in healthy control tissue. PDT caused significant (Foscan p < .05, Foslip p < .001) tumor growth inhibition in both models. A significant (Foscan p < .001, Foslip p < .001) immune system-dependent suppression of lung metastasis was only observed in the K7M2L2/BALB/c model and was associated with a marked infiltration of T-lymphocytes at the primary tumor site. In conclusion, mTHPC-based PDT is effective in clinically relevant experimental osteosarcoma and suppresses lung metastasis in immunocompetent mice with beneficial effects of the liposomal mTHPC formulation Foslip.© 2016 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27581229>Lipidomic Perturbations in Lung, Kidney, and Liver Tissues of p53 Knockout Mice Analyzed by Nanoflow UPLC-ESI-MS/MS.</a></h2><p>Lipids are important signaling molecules regulating biological processes under normal and diseased conditions. Although p53 mutation is well-known for causing cancer, the relationship between p53-related tumorigenesis and altered lipid profile is unclear. We profiled differences in lipid expressions in liver, lung, and kidney in p53 knockout (KO) mice by high-speed quantitative analysis of 320 lipids (399 species identified) using nanoflow ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nUPLC-MS/MS). Lung tissues were most severely affected by the lack of p53 gene, as shown by significant reduction (24-44%, P < .05) in total phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sphingomyelin (SM), diacylglycerol (DG), and triacylglycerol (TG), and significant increases (30-50%) in phosphatidylserine (), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and monohexosylceramide (MHC). MHC levels increased in all tissues. Dihexosylceramide (DHC) level decreased only in kidney tissue. Most PI, , and phosphatidic acid (PA) species showing significant increases contained a saturated acyl chain (18:) in lung and liver tissues. Neutral glycerolipids (16:/22:-DG and most TGs with saturated and monounsaturated acyl chains) decreased 2-4-fold in the liver tissue. Our results suggest that the lack of p53 and altered lipid profiles are closely related, but as their changes vary from one tissue to another, the lipid alterations are tissue-specific.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25475314>Role of sigB and osmolytes in desiccation survival of Listeria monocytogenes in simulated food soils on the surface of food grade stainless steel.</a></h2><p>This research aimed to determine whether the SigB (σ(B)) regulon and osmolytes impact the survival of the foodborne pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes, during desiccation in simulated food soils with varying salt and nutrient contents on food grade stainless steel (SS) surfaces. L. monocytogenes 568 (Lm568, serotype 1/2a), its isogenic sigB mutant (ΔsigB) and the back-complemented ΔsigB were desiccated in BHI, TSB with 1% glucose (TSB-glu), peptone physiological saline (PPS) and minimal media (MM) for 21 days at 43% relative humidity (RH) and  °C on SS. The effect of food related osmolytes (proline, betaine and carnitine) on desiccation survival was studied by (a) pre-culturing strains in MM with an osmolyte followed by desiccation in MM and (b) by desiccating strains in MM with an osmolyte. Desiccation survival of L. monocytogenes was positively correlated to the nutrient and osmolyte concentrations in the desiccation substrates. Initial Lm568 levels of 8 Log(CFU/cm(2)) decreased by .9 Log(CFU/cm(2)) in BHI and 1.1-2.9 Log(CFU/cm(2)) in TSB-glu, PPS and MM after 21 days. Comparatively, the initial survival of ΔsigB was reduced in  and MM, while no differences were observed among the three strains in BHI and TSB-glu. Pre-culture in osmolyte containing MM enhanced (p < .05) desiccation survival of all strains. Desiccation in osmolyte-containing MM improved desiccation survival of all strains, albeit the protection was less than that observed after pre-culture with the osmolytes. Complementation of the ΔsigB mutant restored the wildtype phenotype. In conclusion, this work shows the protective effect of osmolytes in desiccation survival of L. monocytogenes, while the σ(B) regulon only improved the initial survival in nutrient and osmolyte poor environments.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A 2-year field experiment was conducted to assess the potential of a biochar product to alleviate salt-stress to a maize crop in a saline soil. The soil was amended with a compost at 12 t ha(-1) of wheat straw biochar and poultry manure compost (BPC), and a diluted pyroligneous solution () at . t ha(-1) (BPC-). Changes in soil salinity and plant performance, leaf bioactivity were examined in the first (BPC-PS1) and second (BPC-PS2) year following a single amendment.While soil salinity significantly decreased, there were large increases in leaf area index, plant performance, and maize grain yield, with a considerable decrease in leaf electrolyte leakage when grown in amendments. Maize leaf sap nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium increased while sodium and chloride decreased, leaf bioactivity related to osmotic stress was significantly improved following the treatments. These effects were generally greater in the second than in the first year.A combined amendment of crop straw biochar with manure compost plus pyroligneous solution could help combat salinity stress to maize and improve productivity in saline croplands in arid/semi-arid regions threatened increasingly by global climate change.© 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27914242>Molecular lipid species in urinary exosomes as potential prostate cancer biomarkers.</a></h2><p>Exosomes have recently appeared as a novel source of noninvasive cancer biomarkers, since these nanovesicles contain molecules from cancer cells and can be detected in biofluids. We have here investigated the potential use of lipids in urinary exosomes as prostate cancer biomarkers.A high-throughput mass spectrometry quantitative lipidomic analysis was performed to reveal the lipid composition of urinary exosomes in prostate cancer patients and healthy controls.Control samples were first analysed to characterise the lipidome of urinary exosomes and test the reproducibility of the method. In total, 107 lipid species were quantified in urinary exosomes. Several differences, for example, in cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine, were found between urinary exosomes and exosomes derived from cell lines, thus showing the importance of in vivo studies for biomarker analysis. The 36 most abundant lipid species in urinary exosomes were then quantified in  prostate cancer patients and 13 healthy controls. Interestingly, the levels of nine lipids species were found to be significantly different when the two groups were compared. The highest significance was shown for phosphatidylserine () 18:1/18:1 and lactosylceramide (d18:1/16:), the latter also showed the highest patient-to-control ratio. Furthermore, combinations of these lipid species and  18:-18:2 distinguished the two groups with 93% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Finally, in agreement with the reported dysregulation of sphingolipid  in cancer cells, alteration in specific sphingolipid lipid classes were observed.This study shows for the first time the potential use of exosomal lipid species in urine as prostate cancer biomarkers.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

PFCs are difficult to be eliminated from the body. We investigated the influence of different dialysis membranes on the concentrations of PFCs in patients under hemodialysis. : We enrolled 98 patients. Of these, 58 patients used hydrophobic polysulfone () dialysis membranes, and the other 40 had hydrophilic membranes made by poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA) or cellulose triacetate (CTA). Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry coupled was used with isotope dilution to quantify PFOA and PFOS. : The predialysis concentrations of PFOA and PFOS in patients with hydrophobic  dialysis membranes were .50 and .77 ng/mL, respectively, lower than the concentrations of .81 and 22.70 ng/mL, respectively, in those who used hydrophilic membranes (such as CTA or PMMA). Older patients have higher PFOS and poorer body function, with lower Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KPSS) scores. The demographic data of the two groups were similar. However, patients with hydrophobic  dialysis membranes had lower predialysis aspartate transaminase (AST) ( = .036), lower glucose levels ( = .017), and better body function (nonsignificantly higher KPSS scores,  = .091) compared with patients who used other membranes. These differences may be associated with the effects of different membranes, because PFOA positively correlated with AST, while PFOS negatively correlated with body function. : This is the first study comparing PFC levels in uremic patients with different dialysis membrane.  membrane may provide better clearance of PFCs and may, therefore, be beneficial for patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29294112>Feeding of phytosterols reduced testosterone production by modulating GnRH and GnIH expression in the brain and testes of male Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica).</a></h2><p>Phytosterols (), or plant sterols used as cholesterol-lowering agents, have been shown to act as endocrine-disrupting chemicals in some laboratory animals. Moreover, dietary  efficiently pass through the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in brain cell membranes. We asked whether the accumulation of  affects reproduction through the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Thirty male quail chicks were randomly divided into 3 groups (control, 80 mg/kg BW, and 800 mg/kg BW), and daily single doses of  or vehicle were gavaged into the crop sac from  to 100 d of age. At the end of the entire period, half of each group was injected intramuscularly with either 10 μg of chicken gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (cGnRH-1) or phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) as the vehicle. Blood was collected before and 30 min after cGnRH-1 challenge by jugular venipuncture and decapitation, respectively. The results indicated that testosterone concentrations were low (P < .05) before (800 mg/kg BW) and after GnRH challenge in -treated quails compared with controls (P < .001). However, luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were not different among the groups before cGnRH-1 challenge. In addition, -gavaged animals failed to manifest increased LH levels after cGnRH-1 injection (P < .01). The same trends were observed in pituitary LH levels at 800 mg/kg BW  after cGnRH-1 injection (P < .05). Real-time PCR results revealed that  (800 mg/kg BW) feeding reduced expression of GnRH-1 in the brain and testes compared to controls. However, gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) expression was significantly elevated before and after GnRH-1 challenges in the brain and testes. Collectively, these results suggest that brain-mediated effects of  on gonadal function occurs via the induction of GnIH gene expression, and these indirect effects are less potent than direct effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28409157>Ferulic Acid Suppresses Amyloid  Production in the Human Lens Epithelial Cell Stimulated with Hydrogen Peroxide.</a></h2><p>It is well known that oxidative stresses induce the production of amyloid  (A) in the brain, lens, and retina, leading to age-related diseases. In the present study, we investigated the effects of ferulic acid on the A levels in HO-stimulated human lens epithelial (HLE) SRA 01/04 cells. Three types of A peptides (A, A, and A) were measured by ELISA, and the levels of mRNA for the expressed proteins related to A production (APP, BACE1, and  proteins) and degradation (ADAM10, NEP, and ECE1 proteins) were determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. HO stimulation augmented gene expression of the proteins related to A production, resulting in the production of three types of A peptides. Treatment with .1 M ferulic acid attenuated the augmentations of gene expression and production of the proteins related to the secretion of three types of A peptides in the HO-stimulated HLE cells.

It consists primarily of microvascular endothelial cells surrounded by astrocytic endfeet, pericytes, and microglia. Understanding the make-up of transporters in rat BBB is essential to the translation of pharmacological and toxicological observations into humans. In this study, experimental workflows are presented in which the optimization of (a) isolation of rat brain microvessels (b) enrichment of endothelial cells, and (c) extraction and digestion of proteins were evaluated, followed by identification and quantification of BBB proteins. Optimization of microvessel isolation was indicated by -fold enrichment of endothelial cell marker Glut1 mRNA, whereas markers for other cell types were not enriched. Filter-aided sample preparation was shown to be superior to in-solution sample preparation (10251 peptides vs. 7533 peptides). Label-free proteomics was used to identify nearly 2000 proteins and quantify 1276 proteins in isolated microvessels. A combination of targeted and global proteomics was adopted to measure protein abundance of 6 ATP-binding cassette and 27 solute carrier transporters. Data analysis using proprietary Progenesis and open access MaxQuant software showed overall agreement; however, Abcb9 and Slc22a8 were quantified only by MaxQuant, whereas Abcc9 and Abcd3 were quantified only by Progenesis. Agreement between targeted and untargeted quantification was demonstrated for Abcb1 (19.7 ± 1.4 vs. 17.8 ± 2.3) and Abcc4 (2.2 ± .7 vs. 2.1 ± .4), respectively.

We aimed to measure concentrations of 8-isoprostane (8-IsoP) in the exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and exhaled nitric oxide (FE) in patients with SBD and healthy children, in order to assess the relationship between these two biomarkers, disease severity, and overnight changes.Patients with SDB (n = 46) and healthy controls (n = 20) aged 4.5-.1 years (M/F: 36/30) underwent exhaled measurements. Patients with SDB underwent standard polysomnography to define primary snoring (: AHI < 1) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Upon awakening the following morning, FE was measured and EBC was collected for the measurement of EBC 8-IsoP.OSA patients yielded higher awakening levels of 8-IsoP in EBC than  patients and control subjects. The 8-IsoP levels, though not FE, correlated with AHI (r = .40, p = .003) and SaO2 (r = -.50, p = .001). Cut-off levels of 8-IsoP predicted OSA with a high AUC value (.84, p = .000). Sensitivity and specificity for 8-IsoP levels above the percentile 50 (33.3 pg/mL) were 76.5% and 78.1%, respectively. 8-IsoP levels did not change from the evening to morning session, whereas morning FE levels rose significantly only in patients with mild OSA (p = .03).Levels of 8-IsoP, though not FE, distinguish children with OSA from those with  or healthy, correlate with disease severity and closely predict OSA in the whole sample.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Comparative evaluation with commercial carbons (C- and C-ZJ15) and long-term performance evaluation of C-XHIT were conducted in small-scale system-A (S-A) and pilot-scale system-B (S-B-1 and S-B-2 in series), respectively, for treating water from Songhua River. The cumulative uptake of micropollutants varied with KBV (water volume fed to columns divided by the mass of carbons, m(3) H2O/kg carbon) was employed in the performance evaluation. The results identified that mesoporous and microporous volumes were simultaneously well-developed in C-XHIT. Higher mesoporosity (63.94 %) and average pore width (37.91 Å) of C-XHIT ensured a higher adsorption capacity for humic acid compared to C- and C-ZJ15. When the KBV of S-A reached 12.58 m(3) H2O/kg carbon, cumulative uptake of organic pollutants achieved by C-XHIT increased by 32.82 and 156.29 % for DOC (QC) and 22.53 and 112.48 % for UV254 (QUV) compared to C- and C-ZJ15, respectively; in contrast, the adsorption capacity of NH4 (+)-N did not improve significantly. C-XHIT achieved high average removal efficiencies for DOC (77.43 ± 16.54 %) and UV254 (83.18 ± 13.88 %) in S-B over 253 days of operation (KBV = 62 m(3) H2O/kg carbon). Adsorption dominated the removal of DOC and UV254 in the initial phases of KBV (- m(3) H2O/kg carbon), and simultaneous biodegradation and adsorption were identified as the mechanisms for organic pollutant uptake at KBV above 25 m(3) H2O/kg carbon. The average rates contributed by S-B-1 and S-B-2 for QC and QUV were approximately .75 and .25, respectively. Good linear and exponential correlations were observed between S-A and S-B in terms of QC and QUV obtained by C-XHIT, respectively, for the same KBV ranges, indicating a rapid and cost-saving evaluation method. The linear correlation between mesoporosity and QC (QUV) was also identified by the evolution of the property indices of C-XHIT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25702090>Identification of potential erythrocyte phospholipid fatty acid biomarkers of advanced lung adenocarcinoma, squamous cell lung carcinoma, and small cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>New biomarkers for lung cancer would be valuable. Our aim was to analyze the fatty acid profiles of the main phospholipid species in erythrocytes from patients with advanced squamous cell lung carcinoma (SCC), lung adenocarcinoma (ADC), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and benign lung diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma) to determine the fatty acids that could be use as lung cancer markers. Twenty-eight, 18, 14, 16, and  patients with, respectively, SCC, ADC, SCLC, asthma, and COPD and 50 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. Fatty acid profiles were investigated using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry followed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The fatty acid profiles changed significantly in the different pathologies analyzed. Based on the diagnostic yields and operating characteristics, the most significant fatty acids that might be used as biomarkers were as follows: ADC--arachidonic acid (20:4n6) in phosphatidylcholine and oleic acid (18:1n9) in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE); SCC--eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n3) in PE and palmitic acid (16:) in phosphatidylserine + phosphatidylinositol (+PI); SCLC--eicosadienoic acid (20:2n6) in +PI and lignoceric acid (24:) in sphingomyelin. In conclusion, fatty acids from erythrocyte phospholipid species might serve as biomarkers in the diagnosis, and probably in other aspects related to clinical disease management, of ADC, SCC, and SCLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30405297>Race/Ethnicity-Specific Associations between Smoking, Serum Leptin, and Abdominal Fat: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>Smoking is a well-known cardiovascular risk factor associated with weight loss.

In the present retrospective study, we investigated whether structural abnormalities evident in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and hypometabolism evident in [F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) independently influence verbal and nonverbal learning and delayed memory in patients with TLE. Sixty-eight patients with refractory unilateral TLE (35 left TLE, 33 right TLE) were divided into three groups: (1) no evidence of pathology in either MRI or FDG-PET studies (MRI-/PET-, n=), (2) temporal FDG-PET determined hypometabolism with normal MRI findings (MRI-/PET+, n=21), and (3) evidence of temporal abnormalities in both MRI and FDG-PET studies (MRI+/PET+, n=32). A fourth group (MRI+/PET-, n=4) was too small for further statistical analysis and could not be included. Patients with MRI+/PET+ showed worse verbal memory than patients with MRI-/PET- (p<.01), regardless of side of seizure focus. Verbal memory performance of patients with MRI-/PET+ was located between patients with MRI+/PET+ and MRI-/PET-, although group differences did not achieve statistical significance (>.1). No group differences were found for nonverbal memory (p=.27). Our results may suggest an interactive negative effect of metabolic and structural temporal lobe abnormalities on verbal memory.

Subjects were studied with primed continuous infusions of L-[(2)H5]phenylalanine and L-[(2)H2]tyrosine on day 4 following 3 days of diet habituation. Whole body protein kinetics [protein synthesis (), breakdown, and net balance (NB)] were expressed as changes from the fasted to the fed states. Positive NB was achieved at both protein levels, but NB was greater in 2RDA vs. 1RDA (94.8 ± 6. vs. 58.9 ± 4.9 g protein/750 min; P = .0001), without effects of distribution on NB. The greater NB was due to the higher  with 2RDA vs. 1RDA (.4 ± 4.8 vs. -18. ± 8.4 g protein/750 min; P = .0018). Consistent with , MPS was greater with 2RDA vs. 1RDA, regardless of distribution patterns. In conclusion, whole body net protein balance was greater with protein intake above recommended dietary allowance (.8 g protein·kg(-1)·day(-1)) in the context of mixed meals, without demonstrated effects of protein intake pattern, primarily through higher rates of protein synthesis at whole body and muscle levels.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25845217>[Effect of electroacupuncture stimulation of "Baihui" (GV 20) and " Yongquan" (KI 1) on expression of hippocampal amyloid-β and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 in APP/ 1 transgenic mice].</a></h2><p>To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) treatment on the level of hippocampal amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) and its key transport receptor low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP 1) in APP/ 1 transgenic mice so as to explore its mechanism underlying improvement of Alzheimer's disease (AD).Twenty-four male APP/ 1 transgenic mice were equally and randomly divided into model group and EA treatment group, and 12 C 57 BL/6 mice were used as the normal control group. EA (1 Hz/50 Hz, .3 mA) was applied to "Baihui" (GV 20) and "Yongquan" (KI 1) for  min, once every other day for 6 weeks. The learning-memory ability was detected by using Morris water maze testing, left hippocampal Aβ 1-40 and Aβ 1-42 contents were assayed by ELISA, and right hippocampal LRP 1 expression was detected using Western blot (WB).Results of Morris water maze test showed no significant differences among the three groups in the escape latency, the times of the platform-site crossovers, the time spent in the target platform quadrant (P>.05). Compared with the model group, the moderately increased escape latency had a decreasing tendency in the EA treatment group. ELISA assaying showed that hippocampal Aβ 1-42, Aβ 1-40, and ratio of Aβ 1-42/Aβ 1-40 of the model group were significantly higher than those of the normal control group (P<.01). After EA intervention, the increased Aβ 1-42 , Aβ 1-40, and ratio of Aβ 1-42/Aβ 1-40 were remarkably down-regulated in the EA treatment group (P<.01).

After EA treatment, LRP 1 expression level was moderately up-regulated but without significant difference between the model and EA treatment groups (P>.05).EA intervention can lower the level of hippocampal Aβ in APP/ 1 transgenic mice, but its effects on Aβ transport receptor LRP 1 expression and learning-memory ability need being confirmed further.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982924>A High-Fiber Diet Decreases Postabsorptive Protein Turnover but Does Not Alter Insulin Sensitivity in Men with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.</a></h2><p>High-fiber diets (HFDs) are recommended in the diet of persons with diabetes, yet such diets can impair macronutrient digestion and/or absorption, modify insulin sensitivity, and reset .We studied the effects of a HFD on the kinetics of whole-body protein, a macronutrient that could be affected by dietary fiber, in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), under both basal-low insulinemic and hyperinsulinemic conditions.Eight men with T1DM (body mass index range: 21.8-27.8 kg/m2) were studied twice - before and after the addition of guar gum (∼ g/d) to their usual diet for ∼4 mo. Whole-body protein degradation (i.e., the rate of appearance [Ra] of endogenous leucine), leucine disposal to protein synthesis (), deamination, and reamination, were determined before and after the HFD, both in the postabsorptive state and following a euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic, hyperaminoacidemic clamp, using isotope dilution methods.After the HFD, mean values (± SEs) for postabsorptive leucine Ra decreased by ∼20%: from 2.52 (.) to 2.03 (.16) μmol x kg-1 x min-1, P < .049, after vs. before the HFD respectively.  also decreased, by ∼25%: from 2.03 (.) to 1.57 (.), P < .045. Leucine concentration (P = .1) and reamination (P = .095) decreased moderately, whereas deamination was unchanged. Following the clamp, plasma amino acid concentrations (P < .001), leucine deamination (+ ∼50%, P < .00002), reamination (+ ∼30%, P < .0007), and  (+ ∼35%, P < .00001) were all increased compared with postabsorptive state values, whereas endogenous leucine Ra was suppressed (by %, P < .00001, and by 25%, P < .001, with the primary or the reciprocal pool models, respectively). No significant differences in these insulin effects before compared with after the HFD were observed. Metabolic control (glycated hemoglobin), daily insulin requirement, and insulin-mediated glucose disposal were unchanged after the HFD.A HFD downregulates postabsorptive protein turnover in men with T1DM, by decreasing both protein degradation and synthesis, possibly due to a subtle decrease and/or delay in amino acid absorption. It does not significantly affect the insulin (and amino acid sensitivity) to protein turnover, glucose disposal, and metabolic control.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29514328>Effects of dietary protein level and age at photo stimulation on reproduction traits of broiler breeders and progeny performance.</a></h2><p>A study with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement was conducted to determine the effects of 2 dietary crude protein levels, high (CPh) or low (CPl), supplemented with free amino acids (AA), and 2 ages at photo stimulation ()-early (21 wk; PSe) or late (23 wk; PSl)-on reproduction traits of broiler breeders and progeny performance. Diets were isocaloric, and calculated CP content of the CPl diets was  g/kg lower than the CPh diets during all phases. A total of 480 female and 64 male Ross 308 breeders of 20 wk of age were used. Total egg production was similar between CPl and CPh birds during phase 1 and 2 but was reduced by 2.8 eggs for CPl birds during phase 3. For the overall laying period, CPl birds tended (P = .075) to produce 4.7 fewer total eggs. Hatchability of set eggs was similar between CPl and CPh birds during phases 1 and 2 but tended (P = .064) to be lower for CPl birds in phase 3. PSe birds showed an advanced age at sexual maturity and age at peak production of 4.6 and 5.3 d, respectively, resulting in 2.5 more total eggs during phase 1. During phase 1, PSe birds showed an almost 5% increased fertility. Chick production in phase 1 was higher for PSe birds resulting in a tendency (P = .071) to higher overall chick production of almost 8 chicks. Progeny from early  breeders showed an overall significant lower feed conversion ratio (FCR). It was concluded that egg and chick production during phases 1 and 2 were not affected by dietary CP level, but egg and chick production was reduced for CPl birds during phase 3. On the other hand, PSe birds showed an increased number of chicks. It is possible to decrease CP level of breeder diets with comparable reproduction from 22 to 46 wk; however, this is questionable for phase 3. For maximal chick production, early  is recommended.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28414573>Phosphatidylserine Translocation after Radiosurgery in an Animal Model of Arteriovenous Malformation.</a></h2><p>Phosphatidylserine () is asymmetrically distributed across the plasma membrane, located predominantly on the inner leaflet in healthy cells. Translocation of  to the outer leaflet makes it available as a target for biological therapies. We examined  translocation after radiosurgery in an animal model of brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM). An arteriovenous fistula was created by end-to-side anastomosis of the left external jugular vein to the common carotid artery in 6-week-old, male Sprague Dawley rats. Six weeks after AVM creation,  rats underwent Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery receiving a single  Gy dose to the margin of the fistula;  rats received sham treatment. Externalization of  was examined by intravenous injection of a -specific near-infrared probe, PSVue-794, and in vivo fluorescence optical imaging at 1, 7, 21, 42, 63 and 84 days postirradiation. Fluorescent signaling indicative of  translocation to the luminal cell surface accumulated in the AVM region, in both irradiated and nonirradiated animals, at all time points. Fluorescence was localized specifically to the AVM region and was not present in any other anatomical sites. Translocated  increased over time in irradiated rats (P < .001) but not in sham-irradiated rats and this difference reached statistical significance at day 84 (P < .05). In summary, vessels within the mature rat AVM demonstrate elevated  externalization compared to normal vessels. A single dose of ionizing radiation can increase  externalization in a time-dependent manner. Strict localization of  externalization within the AVM region suggests that stereotactic radiosurgery can serve as an effective priming agent and  may be a suitable candidate for vascular-targeting approaches to AVM treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25652012>Polymer nanoparticles mediated codelivery of antimiR-10b and antimiR-21 for achieving triple negative breast cancer therapy.</a></h2><p>The current study shows the therapeutic outcome achieved in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by simultaneously antagonizing miR-21-induced antiapoptosis and miR-10b-induced metastasis, using antisense-miR-21- and antisense-miR-10b- delivered by polymer nanoparticles (NPs).

Tonsillectomy may remove pathogen sources and reduce the mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), limiting degalactosylated IgA1 (deGal-IgA1) production, which is considered to be the initiating pathogenetic event leading to IgA glomerular deposition. In the European network VALIGA, 62/1147 IgAN patients underwent tonsillectomy (TxIgAN). In a cross-sectional study  of these patients were tested and compared to 45 non-tonsillectomized IgAN (no-TxIgAN) and healthy controls (HC) regarding levels of deGal-IgA1, and markers of innate immunity and oxidative stress, including toll-like receptors (TLR)2, 3, 4 and 9 mRNAs, proteasome () and immunoproteasome (iPS) mRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP). Levels of deGal-IgA1 were lower in TxIgAN than in no-TxIgAN (p = .015), but higher than in HC (p = .003). TLR mRNAs were more expressed in TxIgAN than in HC (TLR4, p = .021; TLR9, p = .027), and higher in TxIgAN than in no-TxIgAN (p ≤ .001 for TLR2, 4, 9). A switch from  to iPS was detected in PBMC of TxIgAN in comparison to HC and it was higher than in no-TxIgAN [large multifunctional peptidase (LMP)2/β1, p = .039; LPM7/β5, p < .0001]. The levels of AOPP were significantly higher in TxIgAN than HC (p < .001) and no-TxIgAN (p = .033). In conclusion, the activation of innate immunity via TLRs and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways and the pro-oxidative milieu were not affected by tonsillectomy, even though the levels of aberrantly galactosylated IgA1 were lower in patients with IgAN who had tonsillectomy. The residual hyperactivation of innate immunity in tonsillectomized patients may result from extra-tonsillar MALT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30067440>Pancreatic and bile duct cancer circulating tumor cells (CTC) form immune-resistant multi-cell type clusters in the portal venous circulation.</a></h2><p>Circulating tumor cells (CTC) enter the blood from many carcinomas and represent a likely source of metastatic dissemination. In contrast to the peripheral circulation, KRAS mutation- positive CTC thrive in the portal venous blood of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). To analyze the essential interactions that contribute to carcinoma CTC growth and immune resistance, portal venous blood was collected during pancreatico-duodenectomy in 41 patients with peri-ampullary pathologies (PDAC = 11; ampullary adenocarcinoma (AA) = ; distal cholangiocarcinoma (CC) = 6; IPMN = 7; non-malignant pancreatitis = 2). FACS-isolated cell populations from the portal circulation were reconstituted ex vivo using mixed cell reaction cultures (MCR). During the first 48hr, PDAC, AA, and CC patient CTC were all highly proliferative (mean 1.7 hr/cell cycle, 61.5% ± 20% growing cells) and resistant to apoptosis (mean 39% ±  25% apoptotic cells). PDAC CTC proliferation and resistance to T cell cytotoxicity were decreased among patients who received pre-operative chemotherapy (p = .0019, p = .0191, respectively). After 7 days in culture, CTC from PDAC, CC, and AA patients recruited multiple immune cell types, including CD105 + CD14 + myeloid fibroblasts, to organize into spheroid-like clusters. It was only in PDAC and CC-derived MCR that cluster formation promoted CTC survival, growth, and fibroblast differentiation. FACS depletion of CTC or myeloid fibroblast cells eliminated cluster network formation, and re-introduction of these cell populations reconstituted such ability. Our findings suggest that PDAC and CC CTC survival within the portal venous circulation is supported by their interactions with immune cells within multi-cell type clusters that could represent vectors of local recurrence and metastatic progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551789>Metabolomics Analysis Reveals the Protection Mechanism of Huangqi-Danshen Decoction on Adenine-Induced Chronic Kidney Disease in Rats.</a></h2><p>Huangqi-Danshen decoction (HDD) is a commonly used drug pair for clinical treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in traditional Chinese medicine with good efficacy. However, the potential mechanisms of this action have not been well elucidated. The aim of this study was to explore the metabolic profiling variations in response to HDD treatment in a CKD rat model. CKD rat model was induced by adding .75% adenine to the diet for 4 weeks. The rats in the treatment group received HDD extract orally at the dose of 4.7 g/kg/day during the experiment. At the end of the experiment, serum and kidney samples were collected for biochemical and pathological examination. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS) was used to analyze metabolic profiling variations in the kidney. The results showed that treatment with HDD markedly attenuated kidney injury and improved renal function. A total of 28 metabolites contributing to CKD phenotype were found and identified in the kidney samples. The primary metabolic pathways disordered in the kidney of CKD rats were glycerophospholipid , glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor biosynthesis, and citrate cycle. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) score plot showed that the three groups of renal samples were obviously divided into three categories, and the metabolic trajectory of the HDD treatment group moved to the control group. (E)-Piperolein A, phosphatidylcholines (PC) (18:1/22:6), phosphatidylinositols (PI) (13:/18:1), PI (:/20:3), phosphatidylserines () (O-20:/12:), and triglyceride (TG) (22:4/24:/O-18:) represented potential biomarkers of the renoprotective effects of HDD against CKD.

LEU is also known to activate protein anabolic signaling pathways independent of insulin. Based on our previous findings in COPD, we hypothesized that whole body protein anabolism is enhanced to a comparable extent by the separate and combined co-ingestion of CHO and LEU with protein.To disentangle the protein anabolic effects of CHO and/or free LEU when co-ingested with a high-quality protein, we studied 10 patients with moderate to very severe COPD and dyspnea (GOLD: II-IV, mMRC dyspnea scale ≥ 2), at risk for muscle loss, and 10 healthy age- and gender-matched controls. On four occasions, in a single-blind randomized crossover design, each subject ingested a drink containing .6 g/kg fat-free mass (ffm) hydrolyzed casein protein with, a) no add-ons (protein), b) .3 g/kg ffm CHO (protein + CHO), c) .095 g/kg ffm leucine (protein + LEU), d) both add-ons (protein + CHO + LEU). Whole body protein breakdown (PB), protein synthesis (), and net protein balance (=  - PB) were measured by IV primed and continuous infusion of L-[ring-H]-phenylalanine and L-[C,N]-tyrosine. L-[N]-phenylalanine was added to the protein drinks to measure splanchnic extraction.In both groups, whole body , PB and net protein balance responses were comparable between the four protein drinks, despite higher postprandial plasma LEU concentrations for the LEU supplemented drinks (P < .05), and higher insulin concentrations for the CHO supplemented drinks as compared to the protein only drink (P < .05).Adding CHO and/or LEU to a serving of high-quality protein does not further augment whole body protein anabolism in dyspneic COPD patients at risk for muscle loss or healthy older adults.ClinicalTrials.gov; No. ; URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and .

The E. coli K-12 inactivation kinetics observed in batch experiments was well described with first-order reaction. The optimum inactivation rate (k = .47 log/min) attained at a NP dose of 1 g/L and a  dose of 1 mM, corresponding to total inactivation of 7 log cfu/mL cells within  min. Measured k increased > 2-fold when temperature increased from 20 to 50 °C; and > 4-fold when pH decreased from 9 to 3. Aerobic conditions were more beneficial to cell inactivation than anaerobic conditions due to more reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated. ROS responsible for the inactivation were identified to be SO > OH > HO based on a positive scavenging test and in situ ROS determination. In situ characterization suggested that  effectively bind to NP surface was likely to form charge transfer complex (≡Fe(II)⋯OSOOSO), which mediated ROS generation and E. coli K-12 oxidation. The increased cell-envelope lesions consequently aggravated intracellular protein depletion and genome damage to cause definite bacterial death. The NP still maintained good physiochemical structure and stable activity even after 4 cycle.

Methods A total of 24 healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were equally divided into four groups. Group I received normal saline, Group II received  (20 mg/kg b.w.) by gavage, Group III was treated with DOX alone ( mg/kg b.w., i.p.) and Group IV received the combination of DOX and . Results After 8 weeks, the results displayed that DOX caused a decrease in testicular volume and index, epididymal sperm count, seminiferous tubule diameter and germinal epithelium. DOX also reduced the number of spermatogonia, spermatoctyes and Sertoli cells as well as increased the lumen diameter of seminiferous tubules (p<.05) and the incidence of histopathological changes of the testis.

Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare NAC versus primary surgery () with respect to outcome of pathologic nodal disease.Of 215 patients, 42 (20%) received NAC. NAC use correlated with higher clinical T stage (P < .0001) and younger age (P = .03) with no difference in ER/PR status or tumor grade. Despite higher clinical T stage in the NAC group, rate of pathologic positive axillary nodes was non-significantly lower (NAC 5/42 = 11.9%,  27/173 = .6%, P = .54). In multivariable analysis, after adjustment for confounders including clinical T stage, age, and multifocal/multicentric disease, NAC showed significant reduction in odds of pathologic nodal disease (OR .26, 95%CI:.06-.90, P = .03). Further, among those with pathologic nodal disease, the number of positive nodes was lower after NAC (adjusted P = .03). Extranodal extension was present in 8/27 (30%)  patients vs. 1/5 (20%) of the NAC patients (adjusted P = .36).NAC in cN0 HER-2 positive breast cancers reduces the rate of pathologic node-positive disease at operation and nodal disease burden and may decrease the need for axillary node dissection.© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27620207>Phase I and pharmacokinetic evaluation of the anti-telomerase agent KML-001 with cisplatin in advanced solid tumors.</a></h2><p>KML-001 (sodium metaarsenite) displaces hTERT from the nucleus and is synergistic with cisplatin.

A documented response was seen in a patient with heavily pretreated SCLC in cohort one. Several other patients had reduction in tumor burden. In addition to the dose-limiting toxicity of QTc prolongation, the most common toxicities observed were nausea and vomiting and cytopenias. Myelosuppression was primarily seen in patients who had undergone prior radiotherapy.The combination of KML-001 and cisplatin was technically feasible and active. However, the occurrence of significant QTc prolongation led to discontinuation of the trial. This prolongation was likely a result of electrolyte abnormalities resulting from cisplatin superimposed on the known risks of arsenicals and QTc prolongation. Combinations with other platinum agents (e.g., carboplatin) should be considered. This is the first fully reported human trial of KML-001.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28340234>Detection of severe digital vasculopathy in systemic sclerosis by colour Doppler sonography is associated with digital ulcers.</a></h2><p>Colour Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS) is very important in general vascular diagnostic procedures. Its role in determining the extent of vasculopathy in Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) needs further investigation. The aim of this study was to compare the presence of altered arteries with nailfold capillaroscopy and clinical signs of ischaemia, that is, digital ulcers or pitting scars (DU/). A feasible CDUS protocol is provided.Two thousand five hundred and twenty-eight arteries of the fingers, palms and wrists from 79 SSc patients (32 arteries per patient) were examined using CDUS. Furthermore, nailfold capillaroscopy, clinical and laboratory data were evaluated.Narrowed or occluded lumens were seen in 39.8% of all assessable arteries (n = 2489) and 48.9% of all proper palmar digital arteries (n = 1564) but only .6% (P < .0001) of proximal arteries (n = 924). Fingerwise analyses presented significant coincidence of pathological CDUS findings and DU/ (P = .0009). Pathological CDUS findings were also associated with elevated CRP concentrations, current or past smoking with ⩾20 pack-years, male gender and present or past DU/. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (area under the curve = .727) suggested a cut-off value of ⩾20% pathological vessels (sensitivity: 90.7%; specificity: 47.8%) for the presence of DU/. An examination protocol focusing on the right-hand digits II-V (proper palmar digital arteries) revealed similar results (area under the curve = .751; sensitivity: 93.%; specificity: 43.5%).CDUS of hand and finger arteries allows measurement of the extent of SSc vasculopathy, which is associated with clinical signs of chronic malperfusion. A shortened examination protocol of CDUS (right-hand digits II-V;  min instead of 45 min examination time) could complement vascular diagnostics in SSc.© The Author 2017.

At baseline, the AEX+WL group consumed slightly more protein than the WL group (P<.01). Macronutrient intake did not change following AEX+WL, but the WL group decreased their fat intake and increased their carbohydrates and protein intakes (<.05), which resulted in similar macronutrient intakes between groups post-intervention. Weekday total activity counts decreased 22% (P<.05) following WL. This change tended (P=.07) to be different than the lack of change in non-structured activity observed following AEX+WL.Although similar dietary adherence was observed, these data suggest that postmenopausal women undergoing weight loss may benefit from the addition of exercise to prevent the decline in non-structured activity observed following weight loss alone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29925181>[The effect of microRNA-21 on myocardial fibrosis in mice with chronic viral myocarditis].</a></h2><p> To explore the effect of microRNA-21 (miR-21) on myocardial fibrosis in mice with chronic viral myocarditis (CVMC) and related mechanisms.  Forty 4-week-old Balb/c male mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (10 each): phosphate buffer saline (PBS) group, CVMC group, CVMC+miR-21 inhibitor group, CVMC+isotype control group. The first injection of Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3) or PBS was performed on day , and the total study time was 42 days. Each mouse in CVMC group, CVMC+miR-21 inhibitor group and CVMC+isotype control group was intraperitoneally (i.p) injected with 100TCID50 CVB3 .1, ., and .2 ml on day , 14, and 28, respectively. The mice in PBS group were i.p injected with the same dose of PBS at the same time point. After the initial infection, each mouse in CVMC+miR-21 inhibitor group and CVMC+isotype control group was intravenously injected with .1 ml miR-21 inhibitor or .1 ml isotype control, on day 14 and 28. Cardiac function was measured on surviving mice of 4 groups by echocardiography on day 42. Then, the hearts were removed aseptically to observe the expressions of green fluorescence protein (GFP). The myocardial pathological changes were examined with HE, Masson staining and the myocardial pathological scores (), the collagen volume fraction (CVF) were calculated respectively. The levels of miR-21, collagen typeⅠ-A1 (COL1-A1) and collagen type Ⅲ-A1 (COL3-A1) mRNA in heart were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Furthermore, the expressions of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 7(Smad7) in heart were determined with Western blot assay.  (1) Cardiac function in 4 groups: Compared with PBS group, left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVESD) and left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) were markedly increased in CVMC group and CVMC+isotype control group (all .05), whereas the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was decreased (.05). LVESD and LVEDD were significantly decreased, and LVEF was increased in CVMC+miR-21 inhibitor group compared with those in CVMC group and CVMC+isotype control group (all .05). (2) Myocardial pathological changes: The expressions of GFP in CVMC+miR-21 inhibitor group and CVMC+isotype control group were visible in heart tissues frozen sections. The hearts in CVMC group and CVMC+isotype control group were enlarged and stiff, inflammatory cells were visible and significantly increased myocardial fibrosis was evidenced in mice of these two groups. Higher  and CVF were evidenced in CVMC group (: 1.14±.69 vs. , CVF: (17.86±2.61)% vs. (5.70±1.42)%, all .05) and CVMC+isotype control group(: 1.00±.63 vs. , CVF: (16.78±2.58)% vs. (5.70±1.42)%, all .05) compared to PBS group. Compared with CVMC group and CVMC+isotype control group, degree of cardiac fibrosis was reduced in mice of CVMC+miR-21 inhibitor group (CVF: (11.01±2.55)% vs. (17.86±2.61)%, (11.01±2.55)% vs. (16.78±2.58)%, all .05), whereas  were similar between them (: .89±.60 vs. 1.14±.69, .89±.60 vs. 1.00±.63, all .05). (3) Cardiac expressions of miR-21, COL1-A1 and COL3-A1 mRNA: The cardiac expressions of miR-21, COL1-A1 mRNA, COL3-A1mRNA in CVMC group and CVMC+isotype control group were markedly higher than those in PBS group (all .05), which were significantly downregulated in CVMC+miR-21 inhibitor group (all .05 vs. CVMC group and CVMC+isotype control group). (4) The cardiac expressions of TGF-β1 and Smad7 protein: The cardiac expressions of TGF-β1 protein in CVMC group and CVMC+isotype control group were markedly higher, whereas the cardiac Smad7 protein expressions were significantly lower (all .05) than those in PBS group (all .05), these changes could be reversed in CVMC+miR-21 inhibitor group (.05 vs. CVMC group and CVMC+isotype control group).  Our results suggest that miR-21 contributes to the myocardial fibrosis in CVMC mice through modulating TGF-β1/Smad7 signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25409445>Fine Tuning of CaV1.3 Ca2+ channel properties in adult inner hair cells positioned in the most sensitive region of the Gerbil Cochlea.</a></h2><p>Hearing relies on faithful signal transmission by cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) onto auditory fibres over a wide frequency and intensity range. Exocytosis at IHC ribbon synapses is triggered by Ca(2+) inflow through Ca(V)1.3 (L-type) Ca(2+) channels. We investigated the macroscopic (whole-cell) and elementary (cell-attached) properties of Ca(2+) currents in IHCs positioned at the middle turn (frequency ∼ 2 kHz) of the adult gerbil cochlea, which is their most sensitive hearing region. Using near physiological recordings conditions (body temperature and a Na(+) based extracellular solution), we found that the macroscopic Ca(2+) current activates and deactivates very rapidly (time constant below 1 ms) and inactivates slowly and only partially. Single-channel recordings showed an elementary conductance of  , a sub-ms latency to first opening, and a very low steady-state open probability (Po: .024 in response to 500-ms depolarizing steps at ∼-18 mV). The value of Po was significantly larger (.06) in the first 40 ms of membrane depolarization, which corresponds to the time when most Ca(2+) channel openings occurred clustered in bursts (mean burst duration: 19 ms). Both the Po and the mean burst duration were smaller than those previously reported in high-frequency basal IHCs. Finally, we found that middle turn IHCs are likely to express about 4 times more Ca(2+) channels per ribbon than basal cells. We propose that middle-turn IHCs finely-tune Ca(V)1.3 Ca(2+) channel gating in order to provide reliable information upon timing and intensity of lower-frequency sounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30511255>Determining clinically important differences in health-related quality of life in older patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy or surgery.</a></h2><p>Using the EORTC Global Health Status (GHS) scale, we aimed to determine minimal clinically important differences (MCID) in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) changes for older cancer patients with a geriatric risk profile, as defined by the geriatric 8 (G8) health screening tool, undergoing treatment. Simultaneously, we assessed baseline patient characteristics prognostic for HRQOL changes.Our analysis included 1424 (G8 ≤ 14) older patients with cancer scheduled to receive chemotherapy (n = 683) or surgery (n = 741). Anchor-based methods, linking the GHS score to clinical indicators, were used to determine MCID between baseline and follow-up at 3 months. A threshold of .2 standard deviation (SD) was used to exclude MCID estimates too small for interpretation. Logistic regressions analysed baseline patient characteristics prognostic for HRQOL changes.The -item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS15), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for Fatigue and ECOG Performance Status () were selected as clinical anchors. In the surgery group, MCID estimates for improvement and deterioration were ECOG  (5*, 11*), GDS15 (5*, 2) and VAS Fatigue (3, 9*). In the chemotherapy group, MCID estimates for improvement and deterioration were ECOG  (8*, 7*), GDS15 (5, 4) and VAS Fatigue (5, 5*). Estimates with * were > .2 SD threshold. Patients experiencing pain or malnutrition (surgery group) or fatigue (chemotherapy group) at baseline showed a significantly stable or improved HRQOL (p < .05) after their treatment.The reported MCID for improvement and deterioration depended on the anchor used and treatment received. The estimates can be used to evaluate significant changes in HRQOL and to determine sample sizes in clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679780>Phase 1 dose-finding and pharmacokinetic study of eribulin-liposomal formulation in patients with solid tumours.</a></h2><p>This phase 1 study examined the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of eribulin-liposomal formulation (eribulin-LF) in patients with advanced solid tumours.Eligible patients with ECOG  -1 were treated with eribulin-LF either on day 1 every 21 days (Schedule 1), or on days 1 and  every 28 days (Schedule 2). Doses ranged from 1. to 3.5 mg/m, with dose escalation in a 3 + 3 design. The dose-expansion phase evaluated eribulin-LF in select tumour types.maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose/schedule of eribulin-LF.Totally, 58 patients were enroled (median age = 62 years). The MTD was 1.4 mg/m (Schedule 1) or 1.5 mg/m (Schedule 2), the latter dose selected for the dose-expansion phase. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLTs) in Schedule 1: hypophosphatemia and increased transaminase levels. DLTs in Schedule 2: stomatitis, increased alanine aminotransferase, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. The pharmacokinetic profile of eribulin-LF showed a similar half-life to that of eribulin (~30 h), but with a 5-fold greater maximum serum concentration and a 40-fold greater area-under-the-curve. Eribulin-LF demonstrated clinical activity with approximately 10% of patients in both schedules achieving partial responses.Eribulin-LF was well tolerated with a favourable pharmacokinetic profile.

Hemoconcentration triggers erythrocyte losses to subsequently normalize erythrocyte concentration. The mechanisms of erythrocyte loss may involve enhanced hemolysis, but has never been measured directly in bed rest studies. Steady-state hemolysis was evaluated by measuring two heme degradation products, endogenous carbon monoxide concentration [CO] and urobilinogen in feces, in 10 healthy men, before, during, and after two campaigns of 21 days of 6° head-down-tilt (HDT) bed rest. The subjects were hemoconcentrated at 10 and 21 days of bed rest: mean concentrations of hemoglobin (. ± .2 g/L and 14.6 ± .1 g/L, respectively) and erythrocytes (5.18 ± .06E6/L and 5.02 ± .06E6/L, respectively) were increased compared to baseline (all s < .05). In contrast, mean hemoglobin mass (743 ± 19 g) and number of erythrocytes (2.56 ± .07E13) were decreased at 21 days of bed rest (both s < .05). Indicators of hemolysis mean [CO] (1660 ± 49 ppb and 1624 ± 48 ppb, respectively) and fecal urobilinogen concentration (180 ± 23 mg/day and 199 ± 22 mg/day, respectively) were unchanged at 10 and 21 days of bed rest compared to baseline (both s > .05). A significant decrease in [CO] (-505 ppb) was measured at day 28 after bed rest. HDT bed rest caused hemoconcentration in parallel with lower hemoglobin mass. Circulating indicators of hemolysis remained unchanged throughout bed rest supporting that enhanced hemolysis did not contribute significantly to erythrocyte loss during the hemoconcentration of bed rest. At day 28 after bed rest, decreased hemolysis accompanied the recovery of erythrocytes, a novel finding.© 2017 The Authors.

Because lipid-lowering drugs are contraindicated during pregnancy, natural cholesterol-lowering compounds may be a safe and effective alternative to reduce CVD risk in offspring born to hypercholesterolemic mothers.This study used the hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mouse model to test the hypothesis that mothers supplemented with phytosterols during gestation and lactation would produce offspring with a more favorable lipid profile than offspring from unsupplemented mothers, despite having a genetic predisposition toward hypercholesterolemia.Sixteen female apoE(-/-) mice were randomly assigned to 2 diets fed throughout the gestation and lactation periods: a cholesterol-enriched diet (CH) (.%) or the cholesterol-enriched diet supplemented with phytosterols (CH/) (2%). Serum lipids and lipoproteins were measured by enzyme assay and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively, and liver cholesterol was analyzed by GC.Compared with the CH-fed dams at the end of lactation, phytosterol-supplemented dams displayed lower (P < .05) serum total cholesterol (-55%), non-HDL cholesterol (-56%), and LDL cholesterol (-47%), but no change (P > .05) in HDL cholesterol and triacylglycerol (TG) concentrations. Pups from phytosterol-fed dams demonstrated lower (P < .05) total cholesterol (-25%), non-HDL cholesterol (-25%), LDL cholesterol (-47%), and TGs (-41%), without any change (P > .05) in HDL cholesterol compared with pups from CH-fed dams. Furthermore, compared with pups from CH-fed dams, pups from phytosterol-supplemented dams displayed a lower (P < .05) number of total LDL particles (-34%), VLDL particles (-31%), and HDL particles (-30%).Our results in apoE(-/-) mice suggest that even under strong genetic predisposition to hypercholesterolemia, pups born to mothers supplemented with phytosterols during gestation and lactation exhibit favorable liver and serum lipid responses compared with pups from unsupplemented mothers.© 2015 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26458006>Different Dynamics for IgG and IgA Memory B Cells in Adolescents following a Meningococcal Serogroup C Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate Booster Vaccination Nine Years after Priming: A Role for Priming Age?</a></h2><p>Antibody levels wane rapidly after Meningococcal serogroup C conjugate (MenCC) vaccination in young children, rendering the need for an adolescent booster dose. It is not clear whether circulating memory B cells are associated with persistence of MenC-specific antibody levels.Measurement of MenC-specific IgG and IgA memory B cells and levels of serum and salivary MenC-specific IgG and IgA in healthy 10-, 12- and -year-olds prior to and one month and one year after a MenCC booster vaccination. All participants had received a primary MenCC vaccination nine years earlier.The number of circulating MenC-specific IgG memory B cells prior to booster was low and not predictive for MenC-specific IgG responses in serum or saliva post-booster, whereas the number of MenC-specific IgA memory B cells pre-booster positively correlated with MenC-specific IgA levels in saliva post-booster (R = .5, P<.05). The booster induced a clear increase in the number of MenC-specific IgG and IgA memory B cells. The number of MenC--specific IgG memory B cells at 1 month post-booster was highest in the 12-year-olds. The number of MenC-specific memory B cells at one month post-booster showed no correlation with the rate of MenC-specific antibody decay throughout the first year post-booster.Circulating MenC-specific IgA memory B cells correlate with IgA responses in saliva, whereas circulating MenC-specific IgG memory B cells are not predictive for MenC-specific IgG responses in serum or saliva.

The purpose of this study was to compare concentric responses of EDL from wild-type (WT) and skMLCK devoid (skMLCK) muscles at a range of shortening speeds (.05 to .70 V ) around that expected to produce maximal power (in vitro, 25 °C) both before (unpotentiated) and after (potentiated) a potentiating stimulus (). When collapsed across all speeds tested, neither unpotentiated force, work, or power differed between genotypes (all data n = 10, P < .05). In contrast, although both genotypes displayed speed-dependent increases, these increases were greater for WT than skMLCK muscles. For example, when collapsed across the six fastest speeds we tested, both concentric force and power were increased 30-34 % in WT but only -17 % in skMLCK muscles. In contrast, at the two slowest speeds, these parameters were increased in WT but decreased in skMLCK muscles (8-10 and 7-9 %, respectively). Intriguingly, potentiation of concentric force and power was optimal near speeds producing maximal power in both genotypes. Because the  elevated RLC phosphorylation above resting levels in WT but not in skMLCK muscles, our data suggest that skMLCK-catalyzed phosphorylation of the RLC is required for maximal concentric power output of mouse EDL muscle stimulated at high frequency in vitro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28263175>The purified vepoloxamer prevents haemolysis in 42-day stored, DEHP/PVC-free red blood cell units.</a></h2><p>Use of the plasticiser di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) blood bags poses a potential dilemma. The presence of DEHP in blood bags has been shown to be beneficial to red blood cells during storage by diminishing haemolysis. However, DEHP use in PVC may be carcinogenic or estrogenising. Vepoloxamer is a poloxamer with rheological and cytoprotective rheological properties and a favourable toxicity profile in clinical trials. We hypothesised that vepoloxamer may be sufficient to replace the plasticiser DEHP to prevent elevated haemolysis while conserving the biochemical and redox potential++ in RBCs stored for up to 42 days.Paired analyses of aliquots from pooled RBC suspensions of ABO identical donors were aseptically split into test storage containers (DEHP/PVC or DEHP-free/ethylene vinyl acetate [EVA]) supplemented with or without vepoloxamer (at concentrations of .1, 1, 5 or 7.89 mg/mL) and cold stored for up to 42 days.Vepoloxamer significantly prevented the increased haemolysis induced by the absence of DEHP in EVA bags in a dose-dependent manner by days 28 and 42 of storage (approx. 50% reduction of the maximum concentration of vepoloxamer; p<.001). There was an inverse correlation between the concentration of vepoloxamer used and the haemolysis rate (r=.27, p<.001) and a direct correlation between haemolysis and phosphatidylserine () exposure (r=.42; p<.01). Increased osmotic fragility and shear induced deformability of 42-day stored RBC in EVA bags was significantly corrected by the addition of vepoloxamer.Vepoloxamer, in a concentration-dependent fashion, is able to partly rescue the increased haemolysis and  exposure induced by the absence of the commonly used plasticiser DEHP. These results provide initial but strong evidence to support vepoloxamer use to replace DEHP in long-term storage of RBC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790647>Acute Kidney Injury Induced by Pneumoperitoneum Pressure Via a Mitochondrial Injury-dependent Mechanism in a Rabbit Model of Different Degrees of Hydronephrosis.</a></h2><p>To clarify the effect of mitochondrial injury during laparoscopic surgery of the kidney in different degrees of hydronephrosis in rabbit model.A total of 90 rabbits were randomly allocated into 3 groups (groups PN, PM, and , ie, rabbits without, with mild and with severe hydronephrosis, respectively). The rabbits in the PM group (n = 30) and  group (n = 30) underwent surgical procedures that induced mild and severe left hydronephrosis, respectively.

The study aimed to evaluate the impact of AC after PD for DCC in a large multicentric cohort.Patients from five French centers who underwent from PD for DCC between 2000 and 2015 and received AC (AC+ group) or surgery only (AC- group) were included in the analysis. Variables associated with AC administration were analyzed by univariate analysis. The Cox regression identified covariates associated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The AC+ cohort was matched to the AC- cohort (1:1) by a propensity score () based on the likelihood of AC administration and independent factors associated with decreased OS and DFS.Of the 178 patients included, 56 (31.5%) received AC. In the whole cohort, no difference on OS and DFS between the AC+ and AC- groups was identified (P = . and P = .07, respectively). After  matching, the AC+ group (n = 49) was comparable to the AC- group (n = 49) on factors associated with AC administration and on factors associated with a decreased survival in the large cohort.

Sertaconazole nitrate (STZ), a novel broad spectrum antifungal drug, was suggested as a promising treatment. However, its utility in the ocular route is restricted by its poor solubility, along with other problems facing the ocular delivery like short residence time, and the existing corneal barrier. Therefore, the objective of this study was to formulate STZ loaded binary mixed micelles (STZ-MMs) enriched with different penetration enhancers using thin-film hydration method, based on a 3.2 mixed factorial design. Different formulation variables were examined, namely, type of auxiliary surfactant, type of penetration enhancer, and total surfactants: drug ratio, and their effects on the solubility of STZ in MMs (S), particle size (), polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential (ZP) were evaluated. STZ-MMs enhanced STZ aqueous solubility up to 338.82-fold compared to free STZ. Two optimized formulations (MM-8 and MM-11) based on the desirability factor (.891 and .866) were selected by Design expert software for further investigations. The optimized formulations were imaged by TEM which revealed nanosized spherical micelles. Moreover, they were examined for corneal mucoadhesion, stability upon dilution, storage effect, and ex vivo corneal permeation studies. Finally, both in vivo corneal uptake and in vivo corneal tolerance were investigated. MM-8 showed superiority in the ex vivo and in vivo permeation studies when compared to the STZ-suspension. The obtained results suggest that the aforementioned STZ loaded mixed micellar system could be an effective candidate for Keratomycosis-targeted therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30268448>Rare targetable drivers (RTDs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): Outcomes with immune check-point inhibitors (ICPi).</a></h2><p>Efficacy of immune check-point inhibitors (ICPi) in NSCLC with rare targetable drivers (RTDs) is largely unknown.Consecutive patients with NSCLC and RTDs (non-EGFR/ALK, n-82) were selected from the Davidoff Cancer Center database. ORR, PFS, OS with ICPi, OS since advanced disease diagnosis, TMB, MSI, and PD-L1 expression were analyzed; uni- and multivariate PFS and OS analyses were done. OS with ICPi was compared between the RTD cohort and the non-selected NSCLC cohort (n-278).Of 50 tumors tested, 32%, 38%, and 30% were associated with ≥50%, 1-49% and <1% PD-L1 expression, respectively. Median TMB (n-48) comprised 4 muts/Mb (-57); TMB ≥ 10 muts/Mb was seen in 19% of tumors. Both TMB and PD-L1 expression varied across different RTDs. All the 47 tumors were MSI stable. ORR with ICPi (n-44) was 16%, median PFS was 3.2 months (95% CI, 2.6-5.), median OS was 16.2 months (95% CI, 8.4-NR). No correlation was seen between OS with ICPi and PD-L1 expression (p > .4), TMB (p > .8), or RTD type (p > .3). In the multivariate analysis, ECOG  (p-.005), targeted agents exposure (p-.005), and ICPi exposure (p-.04) were the only variables which correlated with OS since advanced disease diagnosis. Median OS since advanced disease diagnosis comprised 32 months (95% CI, 19.9-44.9) and 13 months (95% CI, 6.6-.9) for patients who were and were not exposed to ICPi, respectively (log-rank test-6.3; p-.01). In the inter-cohort comparison, for patients matched for ECOG  (/1), median OS with ICPi comprised 17.5 months (95% CI, 8.1-NR) and 8.6 months (95% CI, 6.7-NR) for RTD and non-selected patients, respectively (log-rank test-2.4, p-.1).In NSCLC with RTD, ICPi have favorable efficacy and independent impact on OS. NSCLC with RTD is associated with MSI stable status and variable levels of PD-L1 expression and TMB; their predictive value remains to be determined.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AZD7325 and AZD6280 are novel, subtype-selective GABA receptor positive modulators with limited sedative effects.The current study aimed to confirm target engagement at GABA receptors by AZD7325 and AZD6280 in humans and to determine the relationship between exposure, GABA receptor occupancy, and tolerability.Two PET studies, using high-resolution research tomography (HRRT) and the radioligand [C]flumazenil, were performed in 12 subjects at baseline and after administration of single oral doses of AZD7325 (.2 to 30 mg) and AZD6280 (5 to 40 mg). PET images were analyzed using a simplified reference tissue model, and regional binding potentials (BP) were obtained. The relationship between plasma concentration of AZD7325 or AZD6280 and GABA receptor occupancy was described by hyperbolic function, and K  (plasma concentration required for 50% receptor occupancy) was estimated. Assessments of safety and tolerability included recording of adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests.The [C]flumazenil binding was reduced in a dose-dependent, saturable manner by both agents. Maximum receptor occupancy could be reached for both compounds without causing sedation or cognitive impairment. The K  estimates for AZD7325 and AZD6280 were  and 440 nmol/l, respectively.High GABA receptor occupancy by AZD7325 and AZD6280 could be reached without clear sedative effects.ClinicalTrials.gov  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26077140>Use of preoperative performance status and hemoglobin concentration to predict overall survival for patients aged ≥ 75 years after radical cystectomy for treatment of bladder cancer.</a></h2><p>The standard of care for treatment of localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is radical cystectomy (RC). The patient's condition may affect management of MIBC, especially for elderly patients with more comorbid conditions and lower performance status. We retrospectively evaluated the association between clinicopathological data and outcomes for patients with bladder cancer (BCa) treated by RC. We particularly focused on elderly patients (age ≥75 years) with BCa.We enrolled 254 patients with BCa who underwent RC and urinary diversion with or without pelvic lymph node dissection. We assessed perioperative complications and clinicopathological data affecting overall survival (OS) after RC.The incidence of complications was 34.3 %, and that of severe complications (Grade 3-5) was 16.5 %. The elderly group experienced more severe complications (P = .042). Median follow-up was 43. months (range 1.-155.6). Five-year OS after RC was 62.7 %. OS after RC was no different for patients aged ≥75 and <75 years (P = .983). Multivariate analysis revealed that Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG ) and hemoglobin (Hb) concentration were associated with all-cause mortality. Hb concentration of <12.6 g/dl was an independent predictor of a poor prognosis among elderly patients after RC for BCa. ECOG  >1 tended to affect OS after RC in this group.ECOG  and preoperative Hb concentration were useful for prediction of clinical outcome after RC for elderly patients.

Five consented healthy volunteers were scanned on a 7 Tesla Philips MR-system using the optimized protocols at three nominal B amplitudes: 1 μT, 2 μT, and 3 μT.Region of interest based analysis revealed that  is more sensitive (P < .05) to APT and NOE effects compared with SS at low B amplitudes (.7-1. μT). Also, both sequences have similar dependence on the transmit field inhomogeneity. For the optimum CEST presaturation parameters (1 μT and 2 μT for APT and NOE, respectively), NOE is less sensitive to the inhomogeneity effects (% signal to noise ratio [SNR] change for a B dropout of 40%) compared with APT (35% SNR change for a B dropout of 40%).For the same brain coverage, spatial/spectral resolution and scan time, at low power levels  is more sensitive to the slow chemical exchange-mediated processes compared with SS.

A liver IR (70%) model was established and reperfused for 6 h. Prior to reperfusion, the GSP group was administered with GSP (100 mg/kg) for  d, and liver histology was then investigated. Serum aminotransferase and inflammatory mediators coupled with superoxide dismutase and methane dicarboxylic aldehyde were detected. Western blot was conducted to analyze the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, activating transcription factor-4, inositol-requiring enzyme-1, procaspase-12, and nuclear factor-κb. Apoptotic cells were detected by TUNEL staining.The serum aminotransferase, apoptotic cells, and Suzuki scores decreased in the GSP group compared with the IR group ( < .05). The methane dicarboxylic aldehyde level was decreased in the GSP group, but the superoxide dismutase level was reversed ( < .05). Similarly, GSP downregulated the proinflammatory factors and upregulated the levels of anti-inflammatory factors ( < .05). Western blot data showed that GSP increased glucose-regulated protein 78 expression and suppressed expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, activating transcription factor-4, inositol-requiring enzyme-1, procaspase-12, and nuclear factor-κb compared with the IR group.GSP possesses antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects by relieving endoplasmic reticulum stress through regulation of related signaling pathways to protect the liver against IR injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887349>Important prognostic factors for survival in patients with malignant pleural effusion.</a></h2><p>The approach to palliative treatment of malignant pleural effusion (MPE) should be individualized because these patients generally have poor survival. Our study aimed to develop a model to identify prognostic factors or survival time in patients diagnosed with MPE.This is a retrospective, descriptive, observational study to identify prognostic factors related to MPE in patients with a confirmed cancer diagnosis. Cox regression analysis was used to determine significant potential prognostic factors with respect to survival time. Survival time was defined as the time from pathological diagnosis to death.One hundred and sixty-five patients were included; 77 were men (47%) and 88 were women (53%). The median age was 60 years, and all of the patients were pathologically proven to have MPE. Non-small-cell lung cancer (36.%), breast carcinoma (26%), and lymphoma (13.%) were the most frequently diagnosed tumors. The median overall survival of patients from the initial diagnosis was 5 months (range: 1.-96. months). Kaplan-Meier univariate analysis showed that survival was significantly related to the following prognostic factors: ECOG  (hazard ratio [HR] 10., 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 5.96 to 18.50, p < .0001), primary cancer site (HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.23 to 3.22, p < .01), positive pleural cytology (HR 1.25, 95% CI .88 to 1.78, p = .04), and positive histology (HR 1.33, 95% CI .97 to 1.81, p = .04). Other potential independent diagnostic factors that were examined did not affect survival. Cox regression analysis showed that only the ECOG  was highly predictive of survival (HR 73.58, 95% CI 23.44 to 230.95, p < .0001).ECOG  is an independent predictor of survival in patients with MPE at initial diagnosis. This prognostic factor can help physicians select patients for appropriate palliative treatment of this syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25668193>Correlation of perfusion MRI and 18F-FDG PET imaging biomarkers for monitoring regorafenib therapy in experimental colon carcinomas with immunohistochemical validation.</a></h2><p>To investigate a multimodal, multiparametric perfusion MRI / 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose-(18F-FDG)-PET imaging protocol for monitoring regorafenib therapy effects on experimental colorectal adenocarcinomas in rats with immunohistochemical validation.Human colorectal adenocarcinoma xenografts (HT-29) were implanted subcutaneously in n = 17 (n = 10 therapy group; n = 7 control group) female athymic nude rats (Hsd:RH-Foxn1rnu). Animals were imaged at baseline and after a one-week daily treatment protocol with regorafenib (10 mg/kg bodyweight) using a multimodal, multiparametric perfusion MRI/18F-FDG-PET imaging protocol. In perfusion MRI, quantitative parameters of plasma flow (PF, mL/100 mL/min), plasma volume (PV, %) and endothelial permeability-surface area product (, mL/100 mL/min) were calculated. In 18F-FDG-PET, tumor-to-background-ratio (TTB) was calculated. Perfusion MRI parameters were correlated with TTB and immunohistochemical assessments of tumor microvascular density (CD-31) and cell proliferation (Ki-67).Regorafenib significantly (p<.01) suppressed PF (81.1±7.5 to 50.6±16. mL/100mL/min), PV (12.1±3.6 to 7.5±1.6%) and  (13.6±3.2 to 7.9±2.3 mL/100mL/min) as well as TTB (3.4±.6 to 1.9±1.1) between baseline and day 7. Immunohistochemistry revealed significantly (p<.03) lower tumor microvascular density (CD-31, 7.±2.4 vs. 16.1±5.9) and tumor cell proliferation (Ki-67, 434. ± 62.9 vs. 663. ± 98.3) in the therapy group.

Isolated leukocyte count and viability was assessed using trypan blue, and propidium iodide staining. Phosphatidylserine () exposure, a universal hallmark to measure cell apoptosis, was identified by flow cytometry using lactadherin. Caspases 3, 8, and 9, and Bax activation, as well as inhibitory assays with pan-caspase (Z-VAD-FMK) and Bax (BI-6C9) were assessed to determine apoptotic pathways. Porimin activation was used to assess cell permeability.Up to 40% of leukocytes maintained membrane integrity at sublytic concentrations (≤.%) of sclerosants. The remaining 60% did not maintain membrane integrity but were not completely lysed.  exposure was increased with both STS and POL exhibiting a dose- and time-dependant trend. While activation of caspases 3, 8, and 9, as well as Bax activation, were increased in leukocytes stimulated with low concentrations of STS, only caspases 3 and 9 and Bax were increased with POL. Inhibitory assays demonstrated caspases 3, 8, and 9, and Bax inhibition at low concentrations with both STS and POL. Both agents increased the leukocyte activation of porimin at all concentrations. On confocal microscopy, stains for caspases 3, 8, and 9, and Bax were increased for both STS and POL. Porimin stain was markedly positive for both STS and POL.Both sclerosants induced leukocyte apoptosis at sublytic concentrations. STS activated both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis, while POL stimulated the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis only. Both agents induced oncosis. Based on these results, STS appears to have a greater effect than POL.Copyright © 2016 European Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The telomerase activity was detected by ELISA assay during cellular replicative and premature senescence. The mRNA level of oxidative stress responsive genes related with senescence for Foxo1, Foxo3, Pdx1, apoA-I and MMP1 was per-formed by RT-Q-PCR separately.  The mRNA level for Foxo1, Foxo3, apoA-I and Pdx1 was decreased separately during cellular replicative senescence compared to that in the young-stage cells with statistical signifi-cance (<.05). The expression of MMP1 was up-regulated 5.1-fold obviously (<.05). In premature senes-cence, the mRNA level was only decreased for Foxo1, Foxo3 and apoA-I, but up-regulated 2.3-fold and 6.2-fold for Pdx1 and MMP1 respcetively vs 22PDL significantly (<.05).

Pulmonary surfactant () plays a key role in a broad range of treatments for ARDS. The aim of the present investigation was to assess changes in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) from choline and determine the effect of exogenous  on its de novo synthesis in rats with OA-induced PE. Experimental rats were randomized into three groups, including a control group, OA-induced PE group, and OA-induced group treated with exogenous  (OA-). Twenty-four rats were sacrificed 4 h after induction of the OA model, and tissue was examined by light and electron microscopy to assess the severity of ALI using an established scoring system at the end of the experiment. After  μCi 3H-choline chloride was injected intravenously, eight rats in each group were sacrificed at 4, 8, and 16 h. The radioactivity of 3H incorporated into total phospholipid (TPL) and desaturated phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) was measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue (LT) using a liquid scintillation counter and was expressed as counts per minute (CPM). Results showed that TPL, DSPC, and the ratio of DSPC/total protein (TP) in lung tissue decreased 4 h after challenge with OA, but the levels recovered after 8 and 16 h. At 8 h after injection, 3H-TPL and 3H-DSPC radioactivity in the lungs reached its peak. Importantly, 3H-DSPC CPM were significantly lower in the  treatment group (LT: Control: 62327 ± 9108; OA-PE: 97315 ± 10083; OA-: 45127 ± 10034, P < .05; BALF: Control: 7771 ± 1768; OA-PE: 8097 ± 1799; OA-PE: 3651 ± 1027, P < .05). Furthermore, DSPC secretory rate (SR) in the lungs was significantly lower in the  treatment group at 4 h after injection (Control: .014 ± .003; OA-PE: .011 ± .004; OA-: .023 ± .006, P < .05). Therefore, we hypothesize that exogenous  treatments may adversely affect endogenous de novo synthetic and secretory phospholipid pathways via feedback inhibition. This novel finding reveals the specific involvement of exogenous  in endogenous synthetic and secretory phospholipid pathways during the treatment of ARDS. This information improves our understanding of how  treatment is beneficial against ARDS and opens new opportunities for expanding its use.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26548780>TRPM4 non-selective cation channels influence action potentials in rabbit Purkinje fibres.</a></h2><p>The transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) inhibitor 9-phenanthrol reduces action potential duration in rabbit Purkinje fibres but not in ventricle. TRPM4-like single channel activity is observed in isolated rabbit Purkinje cells but not in ventricular cells. The TRPM4-like current develops during the notch and early repolarization phases of the action potential in Purkinje cells.Transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) Ca(2+)-activated non-selective cation channel activity has been recorded in cardiomyocytes and sinus node cells from mammals. In addition, TRPM4 gene mutations are associated with human diseases of cardiac conduction, suggesting that TRPM4 plays a role in this aspect of cardiac function. Here we evaluate the TRPM4 contribution to cardiac electrophysiology of Purkinje fibres. Ventricular strips with Purkinje fibres were isolated from rabbit hearts. Intracellular microelectrodes recorded Purkinje fibre activity and the TRPM4 inhibitor 9-phenanthrol was applied to unmask potential TRPM4 contributions to the action potential. 9-Phenanthrol reduced action potential duration measured at the point of 50 and 90% repolarization with an EC50 of 32.8 and 36.1×10(-6) mol l(-1), respectively, but did not modulate ventricular action potentials. Inside-out patch-clamp recordings were used to monitor TRPM4 activity in isolated Purkinje cells. TRPM4-like single channel activity (conductance = 23.8 ; equal permeability for Na(+) and K(+); sensitivity to voltage, Ca(2+) and 9-phenanthrol) was observed in 43% of patches from Purkinje cells but not from ventricular cells (/16). Action potential clamp experiments performed in the whole-cell configuration revealed a transient inward 9-phenanthrol-sensitive current (peak density = -.65 ± . pA pF(-1); n = 5) during the plateau phases of the Purkinje fibre action potential. These results show that TRPM4 influences action potential characteristics in rabbit Purkinje fibres and thus could modulate cardiac conduction and be involved in triggering arrhythmias.© 2015 The Authors.

Thus, light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) can switch between the photosystems consequently transferring more excitation energy to PSII (state 1) or to PSI (state 2) or can end up in LHCII-only domains. In this study, low-temperature (77 K) steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measured on intact cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii shows that independently of the state excitation energy transfer from LHCII to PSI or to PSII occurs on two main timescales of <  and ∼ 100 . Moreover, in state 1 almost all LHCIIs are functionally connected to PSII, whereas the transition from state 1 to a state 2 chemically locked by .1 M sodium fluoride leads to an almost complete functional release of LHCIIs from PSII. About 2/3 of the released LHCIIs transfer energy to PSI and ∼ 1/3 of the released LHCIIs form a component designated X-685 peaking at 685 nm that decays with time constants of .28 and 5.8 ns and does not transfer energy to PSI or to PSII. A less complete state 2 was obtained in cells incubated under anaerobic conditions without chemical locking. In this state about half of all LHCIIs remained functionally connected to PSII, whereas the remaining half became functionally connected to PSI or formed X-685 in similar amounts as with chemical locking. We demonstrate that X-685 originates from LHCII domains not connected to a photosystem and that its presence introduces a change in the interpretation of 77 K steady-state fluorescence emission measured upon state transitions in Chalamydomonas reinhardtii.Copyright © 2015 Biophysical Society.

The present study investigated the effect of a daily lacto-fermented sauerkraut supplement in relation to IBS patients' gastrointestinal symptoms and gut microbiota composition. A randomized double-blinded intervention was conducted with 34 Norwegian IBS patients. The patients were consuming either pasteurized sauerkraut (; n = ) or unpasteurized sauerkraut (UPS; n = 19) as a supplement to their daily diet for 6 weeks. The differences in change of symptoms were assessed using the questionnaire IBS-Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS) measured at the baseline, and at weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8 (follow-up). The gut microbiota composition was analysed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of faecal samples from the baseline and week 6. The mean change in IBS-SSS was -38.57 ± 17.08  vs. -56.99 ± 16.92 UPS and was significantly improved in both groups (P < .04), while the improvement in symptoms was not different between the intervention groups. The sauerkraut intervention (pasteurized or not) also led to significant gut microbiota compositional changes as determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (un-weighted UniFrac: P = .001, weighted UniFrac: P = .001). Sauerkraut related LAB in feces (Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus brevis) were significantly more often present in the UPS-group. In conclusion lacto-fermented sauerkraut had an effect on IBS patients' symptoms and gut microbiota even though the study was underpowered. Our results indicate that the observed effect to a larger extent can be attributed to the potential prebiotics in lacto-fermented sauerkraut rather than the viable LAB. Future studies with greater statistical power are needed to clarify the possible effects of LAB from lacto-fermented sauerkraut in the treatment of IBS patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26330262>Evaluation of dual-wavelength excitation autofluorescence imaging of colorectal tumours with a high-sensitivity CMOS imager: a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>It is important to devise efficient and easy methods of detecting colorectal tumours to reduce mortality from colorectal cancer. Dual-wavelength excitation autofluorescence intensity can be used to visualize colorectal tumours. Therefore, we evaluated dual-wavelength excitation autofluorescence images of colorectal tumours obtained with a newly developed, high-sensitivity complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) imager.A total 107 colorectal tumours (44 adenomas, 43 adenocarcinomas with intramucosal invasion, and 20 sessile serrated adenoma/polyps [SSA/]) in 98 patients who underwent endoscopic tumour resection were included.

Ratio images (F365ex/F405ex) were created to evaluate the lesion brightness compared with that of normal mucosa, and specimens were categorized into a no signal or high signal group.Adenomas and adenocarcinomas were depicted in 87 ratio images, with 86.2% (n = 75) in the High signal group. SSA/P was depicted in 20 ratio images, with 70.% (n = 14) in the High signal group.Dual-wavelength excitation autofluorescence images of colorectal tumours can be acquired using our high-sensitivity CMOS imager, and are useful in detecting colorectal tumours.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27282074>High wholegrain barley β-glucan lowers food intake but does not alter small intestinal macronutrient digestibility in ileorectostomised rats.</a></h2><p>Using barley cultivars differing widely in β-glucan content, we aimed to determine their effects on small intestinal macronutrient digestion in 24 ileorectostomised rats. The rats were fed 1 of 4 experimental diets, each containing a different barley variety, for 11 d. The diets had a content of , 2.1, 2.6 and 4.3 g of β-glucan/100 g. Feed intake and faecal excretion of fat, protein, starch, and non-starch polysaccharides were determined in the final 5 d of the study and apparent macronutrient digestibility calculated. Higher dietary levels of β-glucan (2.6% and 4.3%) lowered feed intake (by  and 19%, respectively) but final body weight was only lowered by the 4.3% β-glucan diet relative to rats fed the % β-glucan diet (all  < .05). Protein, lipid and starch digestibility was unrelated to the dietary β-glucan content. Higher dietary levels of barley β-glucan lower feed intake of ileorectostomised rats, which is independent of intestinal fermentation and unrelated to macronutrient digestibility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25773359>Design and optimization of topical methotrexate loaded niosomes for enhanced management of psoriasis: application of Box-Behnken design, in-vitro evaluation and in-vivo skin deposition study.</a></h2><p>Psoriasis, a skin disorder characterized by impaired epidermal differentiation, is regularly treated by systemic methotrexate (MTX), an effective cytotoxic drug but with numerous side effects. The aim of this work was to design topical MTX loaded niosomes for management of psoriasis to avoid systemic toxicity. To achieve this goal, MTX niosomes were prepared by thin film hydration technique. A Box-Behnken (BB) design, using Design-Expert(®) software, was employed to statistically optimize formulation variables. Three independent variables were evaluated: MTX concentration in hydration medium (X1), total weight of niosomal components (X2) and surfactant: cholesterol ratio (X3). The encapsulation efficiency percent (Y1: EE%) and particle size (Y2: ) were selected as dependent variables. The optimal formulation (F12) displayed spherical morphology under transmission electron microscopy (TEM), optimum particle size of 1375.00 nm and high EE% of 78.66%. In-vivo skin deposition study showed that the highest value of percentage drug deposited (22.45%) and AUC0-10 (1. mg.h/cm(2)) of MTX from niosomes were significantly greater than that of drug solution (13.87% and .49 mg.h/cm(2), respectively). Moreover, in-vivo histopathological studies confirmed safety of topically applied niosomes. Concisely, the results showed that targeted MTX delivery might be achieved using topically applied niosomes for enhanced treatment of psoriasis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We designed this study to examine cardiac function of neonatal mice (14 days old) exposed to in utero PM.Pregnant FVB female mice were exposed either to filtered air (FA) or PM at an average concentration of 91.78 μg/m for 6 h/day, 5 days/wk (similar to exposure in a large industrial area) throughout the gestation period (21 days). After birth, animals were analyzed at day 14 of life.Fourteen day old mice exposed to PM during the in utero period demonstrated decreased fractional shortening (%FS, 41.1 ± 1.2% FA, 33.7 ± 1.2% PM, p < .01) and LVEDd (2.87 ± .08 mm FA, 2.58 ± .07 mm PM, p < .05) compared to FA exposed mice. Contractile kinetics and calcium transients in isolated cardiomyocytes from PM exposed mice illustrated reduced peak shortening (%, 16.7 ± .5% FA, 14.7 ± .4% PM, p < .01), negative contractile velocity (-dL/dT, -6.91 ± .3 μm/s FA, -5.46 ± .2 μm/s PM, p < .001), increased time to relaxation 90% (TR90, .07 ± .003 s FA, .08 ± .004 s PM, p < .05), decreased calcium transient amplitude (Δ340/380, 33.8 ± 3.4 FA, 29.5 ± 2.8 p.m.) and slower fluorescence decay rate (τ, .72 ± .1 s FA, 1.16 ± . s PM, p < .05). Immunoblotting studies demonstrated alterations in expression of Ca handling proteins- SERCA-2A, p-PLN, NCX and Ca1.2 in hearts of 14 day old in utero PM exposed mice compared to FA exposed hearts.PM exposure during the critical in utero period adversely affects the developing mouse fetus leading to functional cardiac changes that were evident during the very early (14 days) stages of adolescence. These data demonstrated that exposure to PM during the gestation period significantly impacts cardiovascular outcomes early in life.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The photo-functional cobalt ferrite magnetic nanoparticles (CoFe2O4@HP) were uniform in size, stable against  leaching, and highly efficient in the photo-generation of cytotoxic singlet oxygen under visible light. With the CoFe2O4@HP, we acquired in vitro MR images of cancer cells (PC-3) and confirmed good biocompatibility of the CoFe2O4@HP in both normal and cancer cells. In addition, we confirmed the potential of the CoFe2O4@HP as an agent for photodynamic therapy (PDT) applications. The photodynamic anticancer activities in 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL of CoFe2O4@HP were measured and found to exceed 99% (99., 99.4, and 99.5%) (p < .002). The photodynamic anticancer activity was 81.8% (p < .003). From these results, we suggest that our CoFe2O4@HP can be used safely as a type of photodynamic cancer therapy with potential as a therapeutic agent having good biocompatibility. Moreover, these photo-functional magnetic nanoparticles are highly promising for applications in versatile imaging diagnosis and as a therapy tool in biomedical engineering.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26601881>Pretreatment C-reactive protein level predicts outcome and patterns of failure after chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.</a></h2><p>In this study we evaluated the predictive value of pretreatment C-reactive protein (CRP) levels on patterns of failure and survival outcomes in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) who received chemoradiotherapy (CRT).Data from 65 patients who underwent CRT for LAPC from July 2001 to May 2013 were retrospectively collected. Factors, including age, gender, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (), histological confirmation, tumor size, tumor location, biliary drainage, stage, induction chemotherapy, CRP levels, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-lymphocyte ratio, albumin and carbohydrate antigen 19-9, were evaluated with regard to overall survival (OS) and patterns of failure using a Cox proportional hazards model.The 1-year OS and median follow-up for all of the patients were 63.9% and .2 months, respectively. The median survival time and 1-year OS were 18. months and 72.5%, respectively, in the patients with lower CRP levels (≤3. mg/L), whereas 11. months and 30.8%, respectively, in the patients with higher CRP levels (>3. mg/L). Thirty-seven patients had tumor recurrence after CRT. All of the patients with higher CRP levels developed distant metastases as a primary sign of treatment failure. In a multivariate analysis, higher CRP levels were significantly correlated with distant disease-free survival (p = .004, HR = 4.50) and OS (p = .004, HR = 3.001). By contrast, local progression-free survival was not significantly different between the CRP subgroups.The CRP levels were a significant predictor of survival and distant disease control for the LAPC patients who received CRT.Copyright © 2015 IAP and EPC.

The probiotic bacterium Escherichia coli Nissle is unable to produce either EPA or DHA. Escherichia coli Nissle was transformed with the pfBS- plasmid carrying the EPA/DHA gene cluster, previously isolated from a marine bacterium. The transgenic E. coli Nissle produced EPA when grown at 10ºC (16.52 ± 1.4 mg g(-1) cell dry weight), ºC (31.36 ± .25 mg g(-1) cell dry weight), 20ºC (13.71 ± 2.8 mg g(-1) cell dry weight), 25ºC (11.33 ± .44 mg g(-1) cell dry weight) or 30ºC (.668 ± .073 mg g(-1) cell dry weight). Although DHA was also produced at all these temperatures, it comprised less than .2% of total extracted fatty acids. Transcriptomic analysis using Reverse Transcription qPCR showed upregulation of the entire gene cluster in E. coli Nissle. Among EPA/DHA genes, pfaB, pfaC and pfaD were overexpressed (expression ratio of 181.9, 39.86 and 131.61, respectively) as compared to pfaA (expression ratio of 3.40) and pfaE (expression ratio of 4.05).

CYP2C19 polymorphism exhibits marked ethnic heterogeneity. Objective To determine the prevalence of CYP2C19 *2 and *3 alleles in a cohort of Palestinian patients managed with percutaneous coronary intervention and dual antiplatelet therapy, and to determine their role in causing major adverse cardiac events. Setting The blood samples were collected at the European Gaza Hospital, and the molecular techniques performed at the molecular genetics laboratory of the Islamic university of Gaza. Method The frequency of CYP2C19 *2 and *3 alleles was determined in 110 patients managed with percutaneous coronary intervention and clopidogrel. Genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP. Personal and clinical data was obtained from patient record and 6-month follow-up for major adverse cardiac events. Main outcome measureCYP2C19 genotype, personal and clinical data and incidence of major adverse cardiac events. Results The frequency of CYP2C19 *1, *2 and *3 alleles was 82.3%, .5% and 2.3% respectively. Genotyping analysis showed that, 67.3% were homozygotes for CYP2C19 *1, 27.3% were *1/*2, 2.7% with *1/*3 genotype, 1.8% were *2/*3 and .9% were *2/*2. These frequencies were consistent with those of Caucasian populations. According to this study the poor metabolizers phenotype frequency was 2.7%, which is in the same range reported in Caucasians (2-5%) and lower than Oriental populations 13-23%. A strong significant relation was found between major adverse cardiac events and carrying the variant allele CYP2C19 *2 (P = .001). On the other hand, there was no significant relation between major adverse cardiac events and carrying the variant allele CYP2C19 *3 (P = .324). Conclusion The CYP2C19 *2 allele is relatively common in our population, and its associated reduced metabolic activity deserves attention as it leads to an increased incidence of major adverse cardiac events in the follow-up of patients receiving clopidogrel.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29878266>Metabolomics Reveals that the Type of Protein in a High-Fat Meal Modulates Postprandial Mitochondrial Overload and Incomplete Substrate Oxidation in Healthy Overweight Men.</a></h2><p>A meal rich in saturated fatty acids induces a postprandial metabolic challenge. The type of dietary protein may modulate postprandial .We studied the effect of dietary protein type on postprandial changes in the metabolome after a high-fat meal.In a 3-period, crossover, postprandial study, 10 healthy overweight men with an elevated waist circumference (>94 cm) ingested high-fat meals made up of cream fat (70% of energy), sucrose (% energy), and protein (% energy) from either casein (CAS), whey protein (WHE), or α-lactalbumin-enriched whey protein (LAC). Urine collected immediately before and 2, 4, and 6 h after the meal was analyzed for metabolomics, a secondary outcome of the clinical study. We used mixed-effect models, partial least-square regression, and pathway enrichment analysis.At 4 and 6 h after the meal, the postprandial metabolome was found to be fully discriminated according to protein type. We identified 17 metabolites that significantly explained the effect of protein type on postprandial metabolomic changes (protein-time interaction). Among this signature, acylcarnitines and other acylated metabolites related to fatty acid or amino acid oxidation were the main discriminant features. The difference in metabolic profiles was mainly explained by urinary acylcarnitines and some other acylated products (protein type,  < .0001), with a dramatically greater increase (100- to 1000-fold) after WHE, and to a lesser extent after LAC, as compared with CAS. Pathway enrichment analysis confirmed that the type of protein had modified fatty acid oxidation (P < .05).Taken together, our results indicate that, in healthy overweight men, the type of protein in a high-fat meal interplays with fatty acid oxidation with a differential accumulation of incomplete oxidation products. A high-fat meal containing WHE, but not CAS, resulted in this outpacing of the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

Curcumin holds the potential for α-synuclein clearance to treat PD; however, its applications are still limited due to its low bioavailability and poor permeability through the BBB in a free form.  Herein, this paper fabricated curcumin-loaded polysorbate 80-modified cerasome (CPC) nanoparticles (NPs) with a mean diameter of ~110 nm for enhancing the localized curcumin delivery into the targeted brain nuclei via effective BBB opening in combination with ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD).  The liposomal nanohybrid cerasome exhibited superior stability towards  80 surfactant solubilization and longer circulation lifetime (t = 6.22 h), much longer than free curcumin (t = .76 h). The permeation was found to be 1.7-fold higher than that of CPC treatment only at 6 h after the systemic administration of CPC NPs. Notably, motor behaviors, dopamine (DA) level and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression all returned to normal, thanks to α-synuclein (AS) removal mediated by efficient curcumin delivery to the striatum. Most importantly, the animal experiment demonstrated that the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice had notably improved behavior disorder and dopamine depletion during two-week post-observation after treatment with CPC NPs ( mg curcumin/kg) coupled with UTMD.  This novel CPC-UTMD formulation approach could be an effective, safe and amenable choice with higher therapeutic relevance and fewer unwanted complications than conventional chemotherapeutics delivery systems for PD treatment in the near future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29028158>Effects of intratracheal budesonide during early postnatal life on lung maturity of premature fetal rabbits.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to study the effects of intratracheal instillation of budesonide on lung maturity of premature fetal rabbits. The developmental pattern of pulmonary alveoli in rabbits is similar to that in humans.Fetal rabbits were taken out from female rabbits on the 28th day of pregnancy (full term = 31 days) by cesarean section (c-section). The fetal rabbits were divided into four groups: control (normal saline, NS), budesonide (budesonide, BUD), calf pulmonary surfactant for injection (pulmonary surfactant, ), and calf pulmonary surfactant + budesonide for injection (pulmonary surfactant + budesonide,  + BUD). All premature rabbits were kept warm after c-section. After -min autonomous respiration, a tracheal cannula was implemented for instilling NS, BUD, , and  + BUD. The morphology of lung tissues of premature fetal rabbits was analyzed using optical and electron microscopes. Surfactant protein B (SP-B) mRNA and protein levels in lung tissues were determined using polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively.Intratracheal instillation of BUD could increase the alveolar area of the fetal rabbits (P < .01), decrease the alveolar wall thickness (P < .01), and increase the mean density of lamellar bodies (P < .05) and SP-B protein levels in type II epithelial cells of pulmonary alveoli (P < .05).Intratracheal instillation of BUD during early postnatal life is effective in promoting alveolarization and increasing SP-B expression, the pro-pulmonary maturity of BUD combined with  is superior to that of BUD or  alone.

To address this deficiency, this study examined the effect of diurnal cortisol slope (DCS) and heart rate variability (HRV) on emotional memory. Participants included healthy volunteers (44 men and 23 women; mean age 20.60 yrs). Participants were shown emotionally arousing slides and were asked to return to the laboratory one week later where they were given a "surprise" memory test to examine their emotional memory retention. Participants were asked to collect saliva samples at four time points (08:00, 11:00, :00, and 20:00) on the experimental days; these samples were used to calculate the DCS. Moreover, HRV was measured during the experiment. The multiple linear regression analysis revealed that declarative memory ability, sleep duration, and the DCS were the final significant determinants for emotional memory enhancement (B = -20.41, .05, -48.20,  < .05), with participants having flatter cortisol slopes showing reduced or absent emotional memory enhancement.

We aimed to investigate the direct relationship between sarcopaenia and NAFLD or steatohepatitis in the general population.We conducted a cross-sectional study using nationally representative samples of ,132 subjects from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2008-2011. Subjects were defined as having NAFLD when they had higher scores from previously validated NAFLD prediction models such as the hepatic steatosis index, comprehensive NAFLD score and NAFLD liver fat score. BARD and FIB-4 scores were used to define advanced fibrosis in subjects with NAFLD. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) [SMI(%)=total appendicular skeletal muscle mass (kg)/weight (kg)×100] measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to diagnose sarcopaenia with cut points of 32.2% for men and 25.5% for women.SMI was inversely correlated with all NAFLD predicting scores (<.001). After stratification, sarcopaenic subjects had an increased risk of NAFLD regardless of obesity (odds ratios [ORs]=1.55 to 3.02, depending on models; all <.001) or metabolic syndrome (ORs=1.63 to 4.00, all <.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis also demonstrated this independent association between sarcopaenia and NAFLD after adjusting for confounding factors related to obesity or insulin resistance (ORs=1.18 to 1.22, all <.001). Furthermore, among the NAFLD population, subjects with lower SMIs were likely to have advanced fibrosis compared with non-sarcopaenic individuals (BARD and FIB-4: ORs=1.83 and 1.69, respectively; both <.001). Compared with non-exercised subjects, individuals who exercised regularly had a lower risk of NAFLD (p<.001), particularly among obese people with well-preserved muscle mass.Sarcopaenia is associated with increased risks of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis, independent of obesity or metabolic control.Copyright © 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

The compounds were successfully characterised through UV-Vis, Emission, H NMR, and ESI-HRMS techniques. To evaluate the effect of this combination of directly conjugated and non-conjugated pyridyl/cationic pyridinium groups on the porphyrin macrocycle, the efficacy of the synthesised compounds was compared to a known standard 5,10,,20-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin (TMPyP). These compounds show better efficacy (IC's ranging between .66±.04μM to 3.71±1.01μM) against A549 (human epithelial adenocarcinoma lung cancer) cell line under in vitro photodynamic conditions in comparison to MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer) (IC's ranging between 3.7±.087μM to 12.1±.12μM) and Pa-1 (ovarian cancer) (IC's ranging between 17.9±.01μM to 42.45±.02μM) cell lines. It was found that B.3, having a pyridinium group attached to the meso-position of the macrocycle along with three distal cationic pyridinium groups, independent of the porphyrinic electron delocalisation cycle, showed better photocytotoxic efficacy (IC=.66±.04μM, A549 lung cancer cell line) and higher potential to promote apoptosis and hence better efficacy as  towards cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT).

We examined the influence of maternal hypercholesterolemia and phytosterol () intervention on the concentration and  of oxysterols, bioactive oxygenated cholesterol derivatives that regulate arterial health and lesion progression, in mothers and their newly weaned offspring. Twenty-one female apoE mice were randomly assigned to three different diets throughout gestation and lactation: (1) chow, (2) high cholesterol (CH; .%) and (3) CH with added  (2%, CH/). At the end of the lactation period, mothers and pups were euthanized for serum and hepatic oxysterol analyses, hepatic transcriptional profiling of hepatic sterol regulatory targets and atherosclerosis. Hypercholesterolemic dams and their pups demonstrated increased (P˂.05) serum oxysterols [including 24 hydroxycholesterol (HC), 25HC, 27HC, 7αHC, 7βHC and 7 ketocholesterol)] compared with the chow group that were normalized by maternal  supplementation. Hepatic oxysterol concentrations followed a similar pattern of response in mothers but were not altered in newly weaned pups. Hepatic mRNA expression suggested a pattern of enhanced abca1/g1 high-density-lipoprotein-mediated efflux but a reduction in biliary abcg5/g8 export in both dams and their pups. Although arterial lesions were not apparent in newly weaned pups, CH dams demonstrated enhanced atherosclerosis that was reduced upon  intervention. These results demonstrate that offspring from hypercholesterolemic pregnancies have enhanced circulating oxysterol concentrations and highlight the potential utility of  as a lipid-lowering option during hypercholesterolemic pregnancies for which there are currently limited options.Copyright © 2017.

The present study was carried out to evaluate the capability of a polyethylene glycol mimetic technology as a biological alternative to improve pharmaceutical properties of human recombinant EPO. In silico models of EPO fused to 200 amino acids of proline, alanine, and serine (PAS) were initially generated and assessed by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. The fluctuations of the modeled structure reached a plateau after 6000  of MD simulation. The Phi and psi analysis showed >99.2% of residues were located in the allowed regions. An expression vector consisting of EPO cDNA tagged to PAS coding sequences was synthesized and expressed in CHO-K1 Cells. The produced PASylated molecule was purified and characterized by standard analytical methods. The molecular weight of fusion protein was expanded to 70 kDa using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis method. Analytical size exclusion chromatography revealed an approximately sevenfold increase in apparent size of produced protein. Although the in vitro potency of the fusion protein was significantly reduced (1.26 ± .05 vs. .24 ± .03 ng/ml) but, the in vivo activity was considerably increased up to 1.58 × 10 IU/ml in normocythemic mice assay. Pharmacokinetic animal studies revealed strongly .6-fold plasma half-life extension for the PASylated EPO (83.16 ± 13.28 h) in comparison to epoetin α (8.5 ± 2.4 h) and darbepoetin α (25.3 ± 2.2h).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23914786>Nontoxic impact of PEG-coated gold nanospheres on functional pulmonary surfactant-secreting alveolar type II cells.</a></h2><p>The outstanding properties of gold nanoparticles (NPs) make them very attractive for biomedical applications. In particular, the inhalation route has gained considerable interest as an innovative strategy for diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary diseases. It is, therefore, important to scrutinise the potentially deleterious or side effects of NPs on lung epithelium. The present study investigates, for the first time, the impact of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated NPs on freshly purified primary cultures of rat alveolar type II (ATII) cells. These cells play a central role in the respiratory function of the lungs. They are responsible for synthesizing and secreting pulmonary surfactant (), which is required to stabilise the respiratory surface during breathing dynamics. Cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of NPs was evaluated by analysing morphology, viability and exocytotic activity of ATII cells ( secretion). The impact of ATII cells' exposure to NPs was studied in a wide range of gold concentration with particles sizes of  and 100 nm. The results show that PEG-coated NPs are very modestly internalised by ATII cells and it neither leads to detectable morphological changes nor to decreased cell viability nor to alterations in basic functional parameters such as  secretion, even on exposure to high gold concentration (~.2 mM) during relatively long periods of time (24-48 h).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27682805>Polysorbate-80-coated, polymeric curcumin nanoparticles for in vivo anti-depressant activity across BBB and envisaged biomolecular mechanism of action through a proposed pharmacophore model.</a></h2><p>Depression is a modern world epidemic.

Several bioactive peptides and hydro lysates from natural sources have now been tested in animal models of human diseases for potential anti-inflammatory effects. Eggshell membrane (ESM) is a well-known natural bioactive material. In this study, we aim to study the anti-inflammatory activity of ESM hydro lysate (AL-) in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, AL- was shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 secretion. In vivo treatment with AL- was shown to reduce dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced weight loss, clinical signs of colitis and secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 (p < .05). In addition, treatment with AL- also attenuated the severity of intestinal inflammation via down-regulation of IL-10 an anti-inflammatory cytokine.

Their inhibitory efficiency depended on the compound lipophilicity, the electronic properties of the substituent R and the position of the substituent R on the benzene ring. The most effective inhibitors showing IC50 values in the range 2.3-3.6μM were substituted in C'(3) by F, CH3, Cl and Br. The dependence of the PET-inhibiting activity on the lipophilicity of the compounds was quasi-parabolic for 3-substituted derivatives, while for C'(2) ones a slight increase and for C'(4) derivatives a sharp decrease of the activity were observed with increasing lipophilicity. In addition, the dependence of PET-inhibiting activity on electronic Hammett's σ parameter of the substituent R was observed with optimum σ value .06 for C'(4) and .34 for C'(3) substituted derivatives, while the value of σ parameter did not significantly influence the PET-inhibiting activity of C'(2) substituted compounds. Interactions of the studied compounds with chlorophyll a and aromatic amino acids present in the pigment-protein complexes mainly in  II were documented by fluorescence spectroscopy.

The composition of placental glycerophospholipids (GPL) is known to be altered in GDM and might reflect an aberrant fatty acid transfer across the placenta and thus affect the foetal body composition. The aim of this study was to investigate possible effects of obesity and GDM, respectively, on placental GPL species composition. We investigated molecular species of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine () in term placentas from controls (lean non-diabetic, body-mass-index [BMI] 18-24.9k g/m(2), n=31), obese non-diabetics (BMI ≥30 kg/m(2), n=17) and lean diabetics (n=), using liquid chromatography - triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. PE(16:/22:6) and PE(18:/20:4) were increased in GDM and decreased species were PC(18:/20:3), PC(18:1/20:3) and (18:/18:2). A consistent difference between BMI related changes and changes caused by GDM was not observed. Arachidonic acid percentages of cord blood correlated with placental PC(16:/20:4), whereas foetal docosahexaenoic acid correlated to placental PE species. Furthermore, a positive correlation of placental weight was found to levels of PE containing arachidonic acid. We demonstrated that obesity and GDM are associated with decreased dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid and increased arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid contents of placental GPL, with unknown consequences for the foetus. PC(16:/20:4) was identified as the major component for the supply of arachidonic acid to the foetal circulation, whereas PE containing arachidonic acid was found to be associated to the placental and infant growth.ClinicalTrials.gov .Copyright © 2015.

Evaluation of factors predicting the clinical efficacy of vemurafenib may help to identify patients at high risk of non-response in the early phase of treatment. The aim of this study was to analyze the pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib by a population approach and to evaluate the relationship between plasma drug exposure and pre-treatment plasma hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) levels with clinical effects (progression-free survival (PFS), peripheral lymphocytes depletion) in patients with metastatic BRAF mutated melanoma treated with single agent vemurafenib. Concentration-time data (n=332) obtained in 44 patients were analyzed using the NONMEM program. Pre-treatment plasma levels of HGF (n=36) were assayed by ELISA method. A Cox model was used to identify prognostic factors associated with progression-free survival (PFS), and a linear regression to identify factors contributing to the depletion of peripheral lymphocytes at day . Steady-state pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib was described by a one compartment model with first order absorption and first order elimination. None of the tested covariates explained the inter-patient variability in CL/F. A significant decrease in total lymphocytes count was observed within the first 15days (median ratio Day15/Day0=.66, p<.0001). Patients with Day15/Day0 ratio below .66 had longer PFS (14 vs 4 months, HR=.41, CI95%=[.-.77], p=.0095). In the multivariate Cox model analysis, ECOG  was the only parameter independently associated with PFS (grade 1 vs , HR=3.26, CI95%=[1.29-8.22], p=.01 and grade ≥2 vs , HR=4.77, CI95%=[1.52-14.95], p=.007). Plasma vemurafenib exposure (p=.046) and pre-treatment HGF levels (p=.003) were independently associated with the total lymphocyte ratio Day15/Day0. These findings show that plasma vemurafenib exposure and pre-treatment HGF levels are two factors contributing to the early peripheral lymphocytes depletion which itself is associated with PFS.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Carperitide (α-human A-type natriuretic peptide) is a cardiac peptide hormone secreted from the atrium. This peptide hormone enhances diuresis by suppressing the RAAS. In our experience, carperitide alleviates decreased hemoglobin (Hb) concentration during elective surgery. In the current study, we investigated the relationship between low-dose carperitide (.01 µg/kg/min) and Hb concentration during oral surgery.Patients (ASA-: I-II, 40-80 years old) undergoing oral maxillofacial surgery (duration of operation >8 h) were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into two groups: the carperitide group received carperitide at .01 µg/kg/min and the control group received normal saline. Body fluid water [including total body water (TBW), extracellular water (ECW), and intracellular water (ICW)], urine volume, and chemical parameters such as Hb concentration, PaO, and serum electrolytes were evaluated every 2 h.In the carperitide group (n = ), Hb decreased from 12.6 ± 1.1 to 10.8 ± 1.5 g/dl, while it decreased from 12.6 ± 1.4 to 9.5 ± 1.3 g/dl in the control group (n = ) (p < .05). Urine volume (2557.3 ± 983.5 mL) in the carperitide group was significantly more than it was in the control group (1108.8 ± 586.4 mL; p < .001). There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics, body fluid water, PaO, and serum electrolytes between the two groups. In addition, there were no perioperative clinical respiratory and hemodynamic complications in the groups.The Hb concentration in the group administered low-dose carperitide at .01 µg/kg/min remained higher than that in the control group during surgery. Administration of low-dose carperitide may therefore reduce the risk of blood transfusion during surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534195>Transplant-related complications are impediments to the success of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for adult T cell leukemia patients in non-complete remission.</a></h2><p>Outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for patients with adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) are not satisfactory, particularly in patients in non-complete remission at transplantation (Pt-non-CR). We conducted a regional retrospective study in the ATL endemic area of Okinawa, Japan. Of 62 ATL patients, 21 received allo-HSCT in CR and 41 in non-CR. The 3-year overall survival (3yOS) rate and median survival time for the whole cohort was 25.6% and 7.7 months, respectively. The 3yOS of Pt-non-CR was significantly lower than that of patients in CR (Pt-CR) (16.8% vs. 43.6%, P = .005). Transplant-related mortality (TRM) was significantly higher in Pt-non-CR than in Pt-CR (46.3% vs. .7%, P = .025), while there was no significant difference in disease-associated mortality (DAM) between Pt-non-CR and Pt-CR. Multivariable analysis for Pt-non-CR revealed that poor performance status (poor-) and higher sIL-2R level (high sIL-2R) adversely affected OS. Poor- was associated with higher TRM, but not with higher DAM in Pt-non-CR. High sIL-2R did not affect TRM or DAM in Pt-non-CR. Overall, high TRM rates rather than DAM contribute to the poor outcomes of Pt-non-CR, suggesting that not only disease control but also management of transplant-related complications is required for allo-HSCT in ATL patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27916927>Vitamin B12 Status among Pregnant Women in the UK and Its Association with Obesity and Gestational Diabetes.</a></h2><p>To evaluate vitamin B12 and folate status in pregnancy and their relationship with maternal obesity, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and offspring birthweight.A retrospective case-control study of 344 women (143 GDM, 201 no-GDM) attending a district general hospital and that had B12 and folate levels measured in the early 3rd trimester was performed. Maternal history including early pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and neonatal data (birthweight, sex, and gestational age) was recorded for all subjects.26% of the cohort had B12 levels <150 pmol/L (32% vs. 22% in the two groups respectively,  < .05) while 1.5% were folate deficient. After adjusting for confounders, 1st trimester BMI was negatively associated with 3rd trimester B12 levels.

In this study, abundances and characteristics of microplastics in sediments and benthic organisms from the South Yellow Sea were investigated. First, we optimized the sediment sampling for microplastic analysis and found that the top layer (-5 cm) had the highest abundance, and microplastic abundances decreased significantly with increase in sediment depth. The abundance of microplastics was 560-4205 n/kg dry weight in the surface sediments (the topmost 3 cm) of 14 sites and 1.7-47. n/g wet weight in the tissues of benthic organisms. Moreover, microplastic abundances in sediments and benthic organisms were both positively correlated with water depth. Fibers, transparent microplastics, and small microplastics (<.5 mm) were the most dominant types in sediments and organisms. FTIR analysis showed that polypropylene (PP, 31%), polyester (PE, 24%), nylon (19%), and polystyrene (, %) were the most abundant polymers in sediments. The results of SEM showed rough surfaces and obvious cracks on the microplastics isolated from sediments. In addition, characteristics of microplastics in Ophiura sarsii, Crangon affinis, and Acila mirabilis were compared. Our results demonstrate that a comprehensive investigation of microplastics in sediments and benthic communities will help to fully understand the ecological risk of microplastic pollution.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The variation in the surface properties of the granular sludge at different salinities were investigated to further clarify the effect of salinity on the aggregation of anammox granular sludge in this study. High anammox activity was obtained at a salinity of 30 g/L NaCl, and the average removal efficiency of NHN, NO-N and TN reached 91.9% ± 1.4%, 97.3% ± .4% and 86.3% ± .9%, respectively. The sludge particle size in Reactor 1 (with  g/L NaCl as control) and Reactor 2 (with ,  and 30 g/L NaCl) increased from 1.62 ± .16 mm and 1.59 ± .12 mm to 2.71 ± .23 mm and 2.44 ± .19 mm, respectively, during total operation. PN gradually decreased from 30.58 ± 2.5 mg/g to 18.11 ± 2.1 mg/g, and  sharply increased from 1.48 ± .09 mg/g to 10.52 ± .50 mg/g with the increase in salinity. The /PN ratio of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) rapidly increased from .05 to .58 with an increase of salinity. Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results showed that salinity inhibited the expression of anammox sludge hydrophobicity by changing surface groups.

The processes of AVM vessel occlusion after SRS are poorly understood. To improve SRS efficacy, it is important to understand the cellular response of blood vessels to radiation. The molecular changes on the surface of AVM endothelial cells after irradiation may also be used for vascular targeting. This study investigates radiation-induced externalization of phosphatidylserine () on endothelial cells using live-cell imaging. METHODS An immortalized cell line generated from mouse brain endothelium, bEnd.3 cells, was cultured and irradiated at different radiation doses using a linear accelerator.  externalization in the cells was subsequently visualized using polarity-sensitive indicator of viability and apoptosis (pSIVA)-IANBD, a polarity-sensitive probe. Live-cell imaging was used to monitor  externalization in real time. The effects of radiation on the cell cycle of bEnd.3 cells were also examined by flow cytometry. RESULTS Ionizing radiation effects are dose dependent. Reduction in the cell proliferation rate was observed after exposure to 5 Gy radiation, whereas higher radiation doses ( Gy and 25 Gy) totally inhibited proliferation. In comparison with cells treated with sham radiation, the irradiated cells showed distinct pseudopodial elongation with little or no spreading of the cell body. The percentages of pSIVA-positive cells were significantly higher (p = .04) 24 hours after treatment in the cultures that received 25- and -Gy doses of radiation. This effect was sustained until the end of the experiment (3 days). Radiation at 5 Gy did not induce significant  externalization compared with the sham-radiation controls at any time points (p > .). Flow cytometric analysis data indicate that irradiation induced growth arrest of bEnd.3 cells, with cells accumulating in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. CONCLUSIONS Ionizing radiation causes remarkable cellular changes in endothelial cells. Significant  externalization is induced by radiation at doses of  Gy or higher, concomitant with a block in the cell cycle. Radiation-induced markers/targets may have high discriminating power to be harnessed in vascular targeting for AVM treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28577938>Evaluation of the VeriStrat serum protein test in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung treated with second-line afatinib or erlotinib in the phase III LUX-Lung 8 study.</a></h2><p>Identification of biomarkers associated with clinical benefit may be crucial in establishing optimal treatment choice for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung after first-line chemotherapy. In this study, the ability of the VeriStrat serum protein test to predict differential clinical benefit with afatinib versus erlotinib, and the association of VeriStrat status with clinical outcomes irrespective of EGFR-TKI used, was assessed in a retrospective analysis of the phase III LUX-Lung 8 trial.Pretreatment plasma samples were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Spectra were evaluated to assign a VeriStrat 'Good' (VS-G) or VeriStrat 'Poor' (VS-P) classification. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and other endpoints were assessed with respect to pretreatment VeriStrat status; OS was the primary efficacy variable. Outcomes with other efficacy endpoints were similar.Of 795 patients randomized in LUX-Lung 8, 675 were classified (VS-G: 412; VS-P: 263). In the VS-G group, OS was significantly longer with afatinib versus erlotinib (HR .79 [95% CI: .63-.98]). In the VS-P group, there was no significant difference in OS between afatinib and erlotinib (HR .90 [.70-1.16]). However, there was no interaction between VeriStrat classification and treatment group for OS (p=.5303). OS was significantly longer in VS-G versus VS-P patients, both in the overall VeriStrat-classified population (HR .41 [.35-.49]) and afatinib-treated patients (HR .40 [.31-.51]). Multivariate analysis showed that VeriStrat was an independent predictor of OS in afatinib-treated patients, regardless of ECOG  or best response to first-line chemotherapy.VS-G classification is strongly associated with favorable survival outcomes with either afatinib or erlotinib compared with VS-P classification. In VS-G patients, survival outcomes with afatinib are superior to those with erlotinib. VeriStrat classification may guide treatment decisions in patients with SCC of the lung.

Patients were randomised to Arm A: gemcitabine 1000mg/m(2) (days 1 and 8) plus either cisplatin (70mg/m(2)) or carboplatin (AUC=5) (day 1 every 3 weeks) or Arm B: added trastuzumab (8mg/kg loading dose, then 6 mg/kg every 21 days until progression). The primary end-point was progression-free survival (PFS).Among 563 screened patients, 75 (13.3%) were Her2 positive (IHC 2+/3+ and FISH+) and 61 met all eligibility criteria (median age, 64 years; 54/61 males; 50/61 baseline ECOG- -1; 11 locally advanced and 50 metastatic). There was no significant difference between Arms A and B in median PFS (10.2 versus 8.2 months, respectively, p=.689), objective response rate (65.5% versus 53.2%, p=.39), and median overall survival (.7 versus 14.1 months, respectively, p=.684). In an exploratory analysis, trastuzumab-treated patients receiving cisplatin rather than carboplatin-based chemotherapy fared better (PFS: 10.6 versus 8.; OS: 33.1 versus 9.5 months). Myelosuppression was the main grade 3/4 toxicity. A case of grade 3 cardiotoxicity and one death from febrile neutropenia occurred in arm B.The unexpectedly low incidence of Her2 overexpression precluded the detection of a significant difference in efficacy on addition of trastuzumab to platinum-based chemotherapy with gemcitabine.

In the control, soil moisture was maintained near field capacity with leaf water potentials (ΨWL) ranging from -.1 to -.5 MPa. In the drought treatment, the soil moisture was reduced gradually by withholding additional water until ΨWL reached values of between -2. to -2.5 MPa. The tolerant genotypes -1319, MO-20 and MA- recorded significant increases in guaiacol peroxidase activity reflecting a more efficient antioxidant . In relation to drought tolerance, the most important variables in the distinguishing contrasting groups were: total leaf area per plant; leaf, stem and total dry biomass; relative growth rate; plant shoot biomass and leaf content of N, Ca, and Mg. From the results of these analyses, six genotypes were selected with contrasting characteristics for tolerance to soil water deficit [CC-40, C. SUL-4 and SIC-2 (non-tolerant) and MA-, MO-20, and PA-13 (tolerant)] for further assessment of the expression of genes NCED5, PP2C, psbA and psbO to water deficit. Increased expression of NCED5, PP2C, psbA and psbO genes were found for non-tolerant genotypes, while in the majority of tolerant genotypes there was repression of these genes, with the exception of PA-13 that showed an increased expression of psbA. Mutivariate analysis showed that growth variables, leaf and total dry biomass, relative growth rate as well as Mg content of the leaves were the most important factor in the classification of the genotypes as tolerant, moderately tolerant and sensitive to water deficit.

The patients comprised a high CRP group (>10. mg/dL) and low CRP group (≤10. mg/dL), based upon preoperative CRP levels. The overall 1-year mortality was 14.1%; the value was significantly higher in the high CRP group than in the low CRP group (31.8% vs 12.5%; P < .001). On binary logistic regression, body mass index (odds ratio [OR], .93; 95% confidence interval [CI], .88-.99; P = .025), history of malignancy (OR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.47-4.57; P = .001), American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (ASA ) class 3-4 (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.25-3.07; P = .003), preoperative albumin (OR, .39; 95% CI, .25-.61; P < .001), preoperative CRP > 10. mg/dL (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.09-3.80; P = .025), postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.-4.59; P = .019), and creatinine on the second postoperative day (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.00-1.45; P = .048) were independent predictors of 1-year mortality after hip surgery. Male gender and low preoperative hemoglobin were associated with in-hospital mortality, whereas delayed surgery and femoral neck fracture were related to the 6-month mortality. Low preoperative albumin and low body mass index predicted the 6-month and 1-year mortality. An increased preoperative CRP level, particularly >10. mg/dL, was associated with the 1-year mortality after hip fracture surgery in the elderly. In addition, a history of malignancy, high ASA  score, and postoperative ICU admission were related to mortality after hip fracture.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28554072>Polymer-lipid-PEG hybrid nanoparticles as photosensitizer carrier for photodynamic therapy.</a></h2><p>Polymer-lipid-PEG hybrid nanoparticles were investigated as carriers for the photosensitizer (), 5,10,,20-Tetrakis(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-21H,23H-porphine (pTHPP) for use in photodynamic therapy (PDT). A self-assembled nanoprecipitation technique was used for preparing two types of core polymers poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) with lipid-PEG as stabilizer. The resulting nanoparticles had an average particle size of 88.5±3.4nm for PLGA and 215.±6.3nm for PHBV. Both nanoparticles exhibited a core-shell structure under TEM with high zeta potential and loading efficiency. X-ray powder diffraction analysis showed that the encapsulated pTHPP molecules in polymeric nanoparticles no longer had peaks of free pTHPP in the crystalline state. The pTHPP molecules encapsulated inside the polymeric core demonstrated improved photophysical properties in terms of singlet oxygen generation and cellular uptake rate in a FTC-133 human thyroid carcinoma cell line, compared to non-encapsulated pTHPP. The pTHPP-loaded polymer-lipid-PEG nanoparticles showed better in vitro phototoxicity compared to free pTHPP, in both time- and concentration-dependent manners. Overall, this study provides detailed analysis of the photophysical properties of pTHPP molecules when entrapped within either PLGA or PHBV nanoparticle cores, and demonstrates the effectiveness of these systems for delivery of photosensitizers. The two polymeric systems may have different potential benefits, when used with cancer cells. For instance, the pTHPP-loaded PLGA system requires only a short time to show a PDT effect and may be suitable for topical PDT, while the delayed photo-induced cytotoxic effect of the pTHPP-loaded PHBV system may be more suitable for cancer solid tumors. Hence, both pTHPP-encapsulated polymer-lipid-PEG nanoparticles can be considered promising delivery systems for PDT cancer treatment.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, we determined that IgM antibodies against oxidized CL and  (OxCL and OxPS) and phosphorylcholine (anti-PC) could be protection markers for cardiovascular disease (CVD).226 individuals with established hypertension (diastolic pressure>95 mmHg) from the European Lacidipine Study on Atherosclerosis. Antibodies were tested by ELISA. As a surrogate measure of atherosclerosis, the mean of the maximum intima-media thicknesses (IMT) in the far walls of common carotids and bifurcations was determined by ultrasonography at the time of inclusion and 4 years following inclusion.Increases in IMT measures at follow-up were significantly less common in subjects which at baseline had high IgM anti-OxPS and anti-PC at above 75th percentile: OR ,45, CI (,23-,86) and OR .37, CI (,19-,71), p = .0137 respectively and above 90th percentile: OR .32, CI (,12-,84) and OR .39, CI (,-1.00), p = .050 and OR ,22, CI (,08-,59) p = ,0029. IgM anti-OxCL was negatively associated with IMT increases (OR, .32, CI (,12-,84), p = 0231). There were no associations for IgM anti- or anti-CL. Anti-PC, as determined herein by a commercial ELISA, was strongly associated with data from our previously published in house ELISA (R = ,87; p<,0001).) Anti-PC was also a risk marker at low levels (below 25th percentile; OR = 2,37 (1,16-4,82), p = ,0177).High levels of IgM anti-OxPS and anti-OxCL, but not traditional anti-phospholipid antibodies (anti- and anti-CL), are associated with protection against atherosclerosis development. In addition, low IgM anti-PC was a risk marker but high a protection marker.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27770470>Altered interregional molecular associations of the serotonin transporter in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder assessed with PET.</a></h2><p>Altered serotonergic neurotransmission has been found to cause impulsive and aggressive behavior, as well as increased motor activity, all exemplifying key symptoms of ADHD. The main objectives of this positron emission tomography (PET) study were to investigate the serotonin transporter binding potential (SERT BP ) in patients with ADHD and to assess associations of SERT BP between the brain regions. 25 medication-free patients with ADHD (age ± SD; 32.39 ± 10.; 10 females) without any psychiatric comorbidity and 25 age and sex matched healthy control subjects (33.74 ± 10.20) were measured once with PET and the highly selective and specific radioligand [ C]DASB. SERT BP maps in nine a priori defined ROIs exhibiting high SERT binding were compared between groups by means of a linear mixed model. Finally, adopted from structural and functional connectivity analyses, we performed correlational analyses using regional SERT binding potentials to examine molecular interregional associations between all selected ROIs. We observed significant differences in the interregional correlations between the precuneus and the hippocampus in patients with ADHD compared to healthy controls, using SERT BP of the investigated ROIs (P < .05; Bonferroni corrected). When correlating SERT BP and age in the ADHD and the healthy control group, we confirmed an age-related decline in brain SERT binding in the thalamus and insula (R  = .284, R  = .167,  < .05; Bonferroni corrected). The results show significantly different interregional molecular associations of the SERT expression for the precuneus with hippocampus in patients with ADHD, indicating presumably altered functional coupling. Altered interregional coupling between brain regions might be a sensitive approach to demonstrate functional and molecular alterations in psychiatric conditions.

Among 414 patients who relapsed following R-CHOP, 96 received salvage chemotherapy alone [R - cohort]; and 318 received rituximab with chemotherapy [R + cohort] following a protocol amendment. The R-cohort had a higher proportion of patients with  ≥2 and relapse <1 year after R-CHOP. The response rate (45.6% vs. 25.%, p = .0003), CR/CRu (.7% vs. 4.2%, p = .003) and transplantation rate (51.9% vs. 31.3%, p = .0004) was higher in the R + cohort. Event-free (27% vs. 22%, p = .0954) and overall survival at four years (43% vs. 31%; p = .045) were greater in the R + cohort when the patients with best response SD/PD to R-CHOP were excluded. Addition of rituximab to salvage therapy before ASCT appears to improve the response rate, transplantation rate, and overall survival in patients with CD20+ lymphoma who responded to R-CHOP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25196500>Acute kidney injury induced by various pneumoperitoneum pressures in a rabbit model of mild and severe hydronephrosis.</a></h2><p>Increased pneumoperitoneum pressure during laparoscopic surgery can result in acute kidney injury. We aimed to clarify whether intraabdominal pressure tolerance is modified in various degrees of unilateral kidney hydronephrosis in rabbits.A total 90 rabbits were randomly allocated to three groups (group PN, PM and , i.e. rabbits with no, mild and severe hydronephrosis, respectively, subjected to intraabdominal pressures). Rabbits in group PM (n=30) and group  (n=30) underwent a surgical procedure inducing a mild or severe left hydronephrosis. Rabbits in all groups were then allocated to 5 subgroups. Then, they were subjected to intraabdominal pressures of , 6, 9, 12, and  mm Hg, respectively. Acute kidney injury was assessed by measuring serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), tubular cell apoptosis, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and cysteine-rich 61 (Cyr-61/CCN1) expression.Acute kidney injury with increased tubular apoptosis and KIM-1 and Cyr-61 expression occurred when intraabdominal pressure reached ,  and 9 mm Hg in PN, PM and  groups, respectively. The Scr and BUN levels were similar in all groups.In rabbits, kidneys with severe hydronephrosis were more likely to suffer acute injury when they were exposed to pneumoperitoneal pressure.© 2014 S.

The objective of the study is to determine if there is heterogeneity between swine breeds and sex in transcript levels for genes previously shown to play a role in drug  for animals administered flunixin meglumine or fenbendazole. Crossbred nursery female and castrated male pigs (n = 169) spread across 5 groups were utilized. Sires (n = ) of the pigs were purebred Duroc, Landrace, Yorkshire or Hampshire boars mated to a common sow population. Animals were randomly placed into the following treatments: no drug (control), flunixin meglumine, or fenbendazole. One hour after the second dosing, animals were sacrificed and liver samples collected. Quantitative Real-Time PCR was used to measure liver gene expression of the following genes: SULT1A1, ABCB1, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP3A22 and CYP3A29. The control animals were used to investigate baseline transcript level differences across breed and sex. Post drug administration transcript differences across breed and sex were investigated by comparing animals administered the drug to the controls. Contrasts to determine fold change were constructed from a model that included fixed and random effects within each drug. Significant (P-value <.007) basal transcript differences were found across breeds for SULT1A1, CYP3A29 and CYP3A22. Across drugs, significant (P-value <.0038) transcript differences existed between animals given a drug and controls across breeds and sex for ABCB1,  and CYP1A2. Significant (P <.0038) transcript differences across breeds were found for CYP2E1 and SULT1A1 for flunixin meglumine and fenbendazole, respectively. The current analysis found transcript level differences across swine breeds and sex for multiple genes, which provides greater insight into the relationship between flunixin meglumine and fenbendazole and known drug metabolizing genes.</p></html>
