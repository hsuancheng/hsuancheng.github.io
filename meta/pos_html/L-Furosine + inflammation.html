Expression levels of miR-137-5p and IL-10R1 in LPS-induced microglia were determined by quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In addition, mRNA expressions of Janus kinase (Jak1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were also examined by qRT-PCR. SCI model in rats was established and randomly assigned to three different groups: Sham group, SCI group and miR-137-5p mimic group. Within one week of spinal injury, relative levels of miR-137-5p and IL-10R1 in rats of different groups were detected by qRT-PCR. The mRNA levels of JAK1,  kinase (Tyk2) and STAT3 in rats were also measured. Moreover, protein expression of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 in rats was measured by Western blotting. Finally, the improvement of locomotor function in three groups of rats within 4 weeks via BBB rating scale.Transfection of miR-137-5p mimics upregulated relative levels of IL-10R1, JAK1 and STAT3 in in vitro cultured microglia. Similarly, IL-10R1/JAK1/STAT3 pathway was activated in rats administrated with miR-137-5p mimics. Nevertheless, relative levels of classical inflammatory stimulators IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 were downregulated accordingly by miR-137-5p overexpression. Moreover, miR-137-5p effectively improved the locomotor function of rats after SCI.MiR-137-5p exerts an anti-inflammatory response by upregulating IL-10R1, thus improving locomotor function and alleviating spinal cord injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554083>H-NMR-based metabolomics to investigate the effects of Phoenix dactylifera seed extracts in LPS-IFN-γ-induced RAW 264.7 cells.</a></h2><p> has been revealed to play a central role in the onset and progression of many illnesses. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based metabolomics method was adopted to evaluate the effects of Phoenix dactylifera seeds, in particular the Algerian date variety of Deglet on the metabolome of the LPS-IFN-γ-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Variations in the extracellular and intracellular profiles emphasized the differences in the presence of , phenylalanine, alanine, proline, asparagine, isocitrate, inosine and lysine. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed noticeable clustering patterns between the treated and induced RAW cells based on the metabolic profile of the extracellular metabolites. However, the effects of treatment on the intracellular metabolites appears to be less distinct as suggested by the PCA and heatmap analyses. A clear group segregation was observed for the intracellular metabolites from the treated and induced cells based on the orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) score plot. Likewise, 11 of the metabolites in the treated cells were significantly different from those in the induced groups, including amino acids and succinate. The enrichment analysis demonstrated that treatment with Deglet seed extracts interfered with the energy and of amino acids metabolism. Overall, the obtained data reinforced the possible application of Deglet seeds as a functional food with anti-inflammatory properties.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epigenetic mechanisms exert their prime effects in developing cells. We hypothesized that muscle insulin resistance in LBW subjects may be due to early differential epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations in their immature muscle progenitor cells. : Muscle progenitor cells were obtained from 23 healthy young adult men born at term with LBW, and 15 BMI-matched normal birth weight (NBW) controls. The cells were subsequently cultured and differentiated into myotubes. DNA and RNA were harvested before and after differentiation for genome-wide DNA methylation and RNA expression measurements. After correcting for multiple comparisons (q ≤ 0.05), 56 CpG sites were found to be significantly, differentially methylated in myoblasts from LBW compared with NBW men, of which the top five gene-annotated CpG sites () previously have been associated to regulation of cholesterol, fatty acid and glucose metabolism and muscle development or hypertrophy. LBW men displayed markedly decreased myotube gene expression levels of the AMPK-repressing  kinase gene  and the histone deacetylase gene . Silencing of  and  was associated with impaired myotube formation, which for  reduced muscle glucose uptake. : The data provides evidence of impaired muscle development predisposing LBW individuals to T2D is linked to and potentially caused by distinct DNA methylation and transcriptional changes including down regulation of  and  in their immature myoblast stem cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620235>Design of Potent and Selective Covalent Inhibitors of Bruton's  Kinase Targeting an Inactive Conformation.</a></h2><p>Bruton's  kinase (BTK) is a member of the TEC kinase family and is selectively expressed in a subset of immune cells.

In addition, the skin absorption of nanoTiO was studied. Six identical subjects participated in three tests: (A) nanoTiO sunscreen, (B) UV radiation, and (C) sunscreen + UV. The first samples were collected before the test and the second after sunscreen application and/or UV exposure. On day 4, the third samples were collected, and the sunscreen was washed off, and the fourth samples were collected on day 11. The following biomarkers were measured: malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxy--hexenal, 4-hydroxy--nonenal, aldehydes C6-C12, 8--Prostaglandin F2α, o-, 3-chlorotyrosine, 3-nitrotyrosine, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, 8-hydroxyguanosine, 5-hydroxymethyl uracil, and leukotrienes, using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry. Titania was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and TiO nanoparticles by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Sunscreen alone did not elevate the markers, but UV increased the biomarkers in the plasma, urine, and EBC. The sunscreen prevented skin redness, however it did not inhibit the elevation of oxidative stress/inflammatory markers. Titania and nanoTiO particles were found in the plasma and urine (but not in the EBC) in all sunscreen users, suggesting their skin absorption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31452237>PTPRO exaggerates  in ulcerative colitis through TLR4/NF-κB pathway.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have implicated protein  phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) as a key regulator in -associated diseases; however, its role in ulcerative colitis (UC) remains largely unknown. Thus, we aim to elucidate the potential role and underlying mechanism of PTPRO in UC. In this study, increased expression of PTPRO, toll-like receptor (TLR4) and inflammatory cytokines were observed in mucosal tissues (MTs) from inflamed areas and lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) of patients with UC compared with those from healthy controls. Then, it was manifested that PTPRO promoted the expression of TLR4 and proinflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide-induced (LPS-induced) inflammatory macrophage model. Besides, PTPRO inhibited the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) but enhanced the apoptosis of IECs in macrophages. Moreover, levels of phosphorylated nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)/p65 and inhibitor of NF-κB α (IκBα) were more significantly increased in PTPRO overexpressed macrophages. In addition, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.807 (95%CI = 0.686-0.958, P < .001) suggesting PTPRO as an ideal diagnostic marker for UC. Taken these, the present study shows strong evidence that PTPRO exaggerates  in UC via TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648566>Intraocular VEGF deprivation induces degeneration and fibrogenic response in retina.</a></h2><p>VEGF is a critical driver of ocular neovascularization under disease conditions. Current therapeutic strategies rely on intraocular delivery of VEGF-antagonizing reagents, which results in sustained suppression of pathogenic vascularization. Although significant advancement has been achieved in VEGF antagonism, substantial adverse effects have been reported in retrospective clinical studies. To study mechanisms for VEGF antagonism-associated adverse effects in visual system, we intravitreally delivered recombinant adeno-associated virus-mediated expression of soluble Fms-related  kinase-1 (rAAV.sFLT-1), the extracellular domain of VEGF receptor, and analyzed the morphology and functions of retinal tissue. Here, we confirmed that intraocular VEGF antagonism induced retinal degeneration and gliosis. The functional deficit in retinal response to visual stimulation was also demonstrated in rAAV.sFLT-1-treated eyes by electroretinogram. Moreover, high-throughput RNA sequencing analysis suggests that VEGF antagonism activates retinal degeneration, , and other adverse effects. Taken together, our findings have shed light on pathogenic mechanisms for VEGF antagonism-associated adverse effects and potential therapeutic targets.-Xiao, M., Liu, Y., Wang, L., Liang, J., Wang, T., Zhai, Y., Wang, Y., Liu, S., Liu, W., Luo, X., Wang, F., Sun, X.

However, there is no effective drug for this disease to date. Picrasma quassioides (D.Don) Benn, a Chinese traditional medicine, was used mainly for the treatment of , fever, microbial infection and dysentery. In this paper, we reported that the EtOAc extract of Picrasma quassioides stems showed potential neuroprotective activities in l-glutamate-stimulated PC12 and Aβ-stimulated SH-SY5Y cell models, as well as improved memory and cognitive abilities in AD mice induced by amyloid-β peptide. Moreover, it was revealed that the anti-AD mechanism was related to suppressing neuroinflammatory and reducing Aβ deposition using ELISA assay kits. To clarify the active components of the EtOAc extract of Picrasma quassioides stems, a systematic phytochemistry study led to isolate and identify six β-carboline alkaloids (1-6), seven canthin-6-one alkaloids (7-13), and five quassinoids (14-18). Among them, four β-carbolines (1-3, and 6) and six canthin-6-ones (7-11, and 13) exhibited potential neuroprotective activities in vitro. Based on these date, the structure-activity relationships of alkaloids were discussed. Furthermore, molecular docking experiments showed that compounds 2 and 3 have high affinity for both of dual-specificity  phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYPKIA) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

DDRs regulate cell functions, and their extracellular domains affect collagen fibrillogenesis and mineralization. Based on the collagenous nature of dentoalveolar tissues, we hypothesized that DDR1 plays an important role in dentoalveolar development and function. Radiography, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), histology, histomorphometry, in situ hybridization (ISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to analyze  knockout () mice and wild-type (WT) controls at 1, 2, and 9 mo, and ISH and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were employed to assess / messenger RNA expression in mouse and human tissues. Radiographic images showed normal molars but abnormal mandibular condyles, as well as alveolar bone loss in  mice versus WT controls at 9 mo. Histological, histomorphometric, micro-CT, and TEM analyses indicated no differences in enamel or dentin  versus WT molars. Total volumes (TVs) and bone volumes (BVs) of subchondral and ramus bone of  versus WT condyles were increased and bone volume fraction (BV/TV) was reduced at 1 and 9 mo. There were no differences in alveolar bone volume at 1 mo, but at 9 mo, severe periodontal defects and significant alveolar bone loss (14%;  < 0.0001) were evident in  versus WT mandibles. Histology, ISH, and IHC revealed disrupted junctional epithelium, connective tissue destruction, bacterial invasion, increased neutrophil infiltration, upregulation of cytokines including macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and 3-fold increased osteoclast numbers ( < 0.05) in  versus WT periodontia at 9 mo. In normal mouse tissues, ISH and qPCR revealed  expression in basal cell layers of the oral epithelia and in immune cells. We confirmed a similar expression pattern in human oral epithelium by ISH and qPCR. We propose that DDR1 plays an important role in periodontal homeostasis and that absence of DDR1 predisposes mice to periodontal breakdown.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31079293>Chronic Mild Gut  Accelerates Brain Neuropathology and Motor Dysfunction in α-Synuclein Mutant Mice.</a></h2><p>Emerging findings suggest that Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology (α-synuclein accumulation) and neuronal dysfunction may occur first in peripheral neurons of the autonomic nervous system including the enteric branches of the vagus nerve. The risk of PD increases greatly in people over the age of 65, a period of life in which chronic  is common in many organ systems including the gut. Here we report that chronic mild focal intestinal  accelerates the age of disease onset in α-synuclein mutant PD mice. Wild-type and PD mice treated with 0.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in their drinking water for 12 weeks beginning at 3 months of age exhibited histological and biochemical features of mild gut . The age of onset of motor dysfunction, evaluated using a rotarod test, gait analysis, and grip strength measurements, was significantly earlier in DSS-treated PD mice compared to control PD mice. Levels of the dopaminergic neuron marker  hydroxylase in the striatum and numbers of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra were reduced in PD mice with gut . Levels of total and phosphorylated α-synuclein were elevated in enteric and brain neurons in DSS-treated PD mice, suggesting that mild gut  accelerates α-synuclein pathology. Markers of  in the colon and brain, but not in the blood, were elevated in DSS-treated PD mice, consistent with retrograde transneuronal propagation of α-synuclein pathology and neuroinflammation from the gut to the brain.

However, the disease driving stem cell population is not fully targeted by TKI therapy, and leukemic stem cells (LSC) capable of re-inducing the disease can persist. Single-cell RNA-sequencing technology recently identified an enriched inflammatory gene signature with TNFα and TGFβ being activated in TKI persisting quiescent LSC. Here, we studied the effects of human TNFα antibody infliximab (IFX), which has been shown to induce anti-inflammatory effects in mice, combined with TKI treatment on LSC function.We first performed GSEA-pathway analysis using our microarray data of murine LSK cells (lin; Sca-1; c-kit) from the SCLtTA/Bcr-Abl CML transgenic mouse model. Bcr-Abl positive cell lines were generated by retroviral transduction. Clonogenic potential was assessed by CFU (colony forming unit). CML mice were treated with nilotinib or nilotinib plus infliximab, and serial transplantation experiments were performed.Likewise to human CML, TNFα signaling was specifically active in murine CML stem cells, and ectopic expression of Bcr-Abl in murine and human progenitor cell lines induced TNFα expression. In vitro exposure to human (IFX) or murine (MP6-XT22) TNFα antibody reduced clonogenic growth of CML cells. Interestingly, TNFα antibody treatment enhanced TKI-induced effects on immature cells in vitro. Additionally, in transplant and serial transplant experiments, using our transgenic CML mouse model, we could subsequently show that IFX therapy boosted TKI-induced effects and further reduced the proportion of malignant stem cells in vivo.TNFα signaling is induced in CML stem cells, and anti-inflammatory therapy enhances TKI-induced decline of LSC, confirming that successful targeting of persisting CML stem cells can be enhanced by addressing their malignant microenvironment simultaneously.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103701>Methylglyoxal activates osteoclasts through JNK pathway leading to osteoporosis.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia and its diverse complications. Hyperglycemia is associated with inflammatory responses in different organs, and diabetic patients have a higher risk of bone fracture due to increased bone weakness. Methylglyoxal, a reactive advanced glycation end product precursor, is known to have increased level in diabetic patients. The accumulation of methylglyoxal promotes  and it may play a role in diabetes related osteoporosis. In this study, therefore, the underlying mechanism of methylglyoxal on osteoporosis was studied using both animal and cell models. In the animal model, rats were treated with either methylglyoxal or saline as control. In the cell model, the macrophage RAW264.7 was treated with methylglyoxal or vehicle control. Following the treatment, animal samples were harvested for micro-CT and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses. Cell samples were harvested for MTT assay, RT-PCR, and Western Blotting analyses. In both animals and cell cultures, methylglyoxal was shown to induce osteoclastogenesis by increased gene expression of osteoclast bone biomarkers CTSK, OSCAR and TRACP5. Furthermore, in methylglyoxal-treated macrophages activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinases signaling pathway was observed, and inhibition of JNK activities resulted in down-regulation of osteoclast biomarkers gene expressions. Our results therefore suggested that methylglyoxal may contribute to the progression of diabetes-related osteoporosis and imbalanced bone remodeling through JNK pathway in osteoclasts.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Several epidemiological and clinical studies have concluded that fermented dairy products can help prevent cognitive decline; furthermore, intake of Camembert cheese prevents microglial  and Alzheimer's pathology in mouse models. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the preventive effects of fermented dairy products, we screened peptides from digested milk protein for their potential to regulate the activation of microglia. We identified dipeptides of tryptophan- (WY) and tryptophan-methionine that suppressed the microglial inflammatory response and enhanced the phagocytosis of amyloid-β (Aβ). Various fermented dairy products and food materials contain the WY peptide. Orally administered WY peptide was smoothly absorbed into blood, delivered to the brain, and improved the cognitive decline induced by lipopolysaccharide via the suppression of . Intake of the WY peptide prevented microglial , hippocampal long-term potential deficit, and memory impairment in aged mice.

A wealth of epidemiological data has undisputedly implicated ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from sunlight and artificial sources as the major risk factor for melanomagenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms of this cause-and-effect relationship remain murky and understudied. Recent efforts on multiple fronts have brought unprecedented expansion of our knowledge base on this subject and it is now clear that melanoma is caused by a complex interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental exposure, primarily to UVR.

Analysis of the epidermis from SUV-irradiated mice revealed rapid phosphorylation of STAT1 (pSTAT1) on both  (tyr701) and serine (ser727) residues and increased levels of IRF-1 while later timepoints showed increased levels of unphosphorylated STAT1 (uSTAT1). STAT1 activation led to upregulation of several proinflammatory chemokine mRNAs in epidermis including Cxcl9, Cxcl10, and Ccl2, as well as, the immune checkpoint inhibitor Pd-l1. In addition, mRNA and protein levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2/COX2) were upregulated in epidermis following exposure to SUV. Mice with keratinocyte-specific STAT1 deletion did not exhibit increased IRF-1 or proinflammatory gene expression in epidermis. Furthermore, epidermal COX-2 induction after SUV exposure was significantly reduced in mice with keratinocyte-specific deletion of STAT1. Additionally, SUV irradiation rapidly upregulated interferon gamma (IFNγ) mRNA in the epidermis and that skin resident epidermal CD3 + T-cells were the source of IFNγ production. IFNγ receptor-deficient mice confirmed dependency of STAT1 activation, proinflammatory gene expression and COX-2 upregulation in the epidermis on paracrine IFNγ signaling. Furthermore, keratinocyte-specific STAT1-deficiency reduced proliferation and hyperplasia due to SUV irradiation and this was associated with decreased immune infiltration of mast cells in the dermis. Collectively, the current results demonstrate that exposure to SUV leads to upregulation of IFNγ and downstream pSTAT1/IRF-1/uSTAT1 signaling in the epidermis. Further study of this pathway could lead to identification of novel targets for the prevention of nonmelanoma skin cancer.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351160>The compensatory antioxidant response system with a focus on neuroprogressive disorders.</a></h2><p>Major antioxidant responses to increased levels of inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative stress (ONS) are detailed. In response to increasing levels of nitric oxide, S-nitrosylation of cysteine thiol groups leads to post-transcriptional modification of many cellular proteins and thereby regulates their activity and allows cellular adaptation to increased levels of ONS. S-nitrosylation inhibits the function of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, toll-like receptor-mediated signalling and the activity of several mitogen-activated protein kinases, while activating nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2 or NFE2L2); in turn, the redox-regulated activation of Nrf2 leads to increased levels and/or activity of key enzymes and transporter systems involved in the glutathione system. The Nrf2/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 axis is associated with upregulation of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, which in turn has anti-inflammatory effects. Increased Nrf2 transcriptional activity also leads to activation of haem oxygenase-1, which is associated with upregulation of bilirubin, biliverdin and biliverdin reductase as well as increased carbon monoxide signalling, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity. Associated transcriptional responses, which may be mediated by retrograde signalling owing to elevated hydrogen peroxide, include the unfolded protein response (UPR), mitohormesis and the mitochondrial UPR; the UPR also results from increasing levels of mitochondrial and cytosolic reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species leading to nitrosylation, glutathionylation, oxidation and nitration of crucial cysteine and  causing protein misfolding and the development of endoplasmic reticulum stress. It is shown how these mechanisms co-operate in forming a co-ordinated rapid and prolonged compensatory antioxidant response system.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, how distinct positive and negative regulatory signals from immune receptors are integrated to tailor specific responses in complex scenarios remains largely undefined. Clec12A is a myeloid cell-expressed inhibitory C-type lectin receptor that can sense cell death under sterile conditions. Clec12A detects uric acid crystals and limits proinflammatory pathways by counteracting the cell-activating spleen  kinase (Syk). Here, we surprisingly find that Clec12A additionally amplifies type I IFN (IFN-I) responses in vivo and in vitro. Using retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) signaling as a model, we demonstrate that monosodium urate (MSU) crystal sensing by Clec12A enhances cytosolic RNA-induced IFN-I production and the subsequent induction of IFN-I-stimulated genes. Mechanistically, Clec12A engages Src kinase to positively regulate the TBK1-IRF3 signaling module. Consistently, Clec12A-deficient mice exhibit reduced IFN-I responses upon lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, which affects the outcomes of these animals in acute and chronic virus infection models. Thus, our results uncover a previously unrecognized connection between an MSU crystal-sensing receptor and the IFN-I response, and they illustrate how the sensing of extracellular damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) can shape the immune response.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

However, immune-resistant cancer cells can evade the immune system and proceed to form tumors. The normal microenvironment (immune cells, fibroblasts, blood and lymphatic vessels, and interstitial extracellular matrix (ECM)) maintains tissue homeostasis and prevents tumor initiation. Inflammatory mediators, reactive oxygen species, cytokines, and chemokines from an altered microenvironment promote tumor growth. During the last decade, thyroid cancer, the most frequent cancer of the endocrine system, has emerged as the fifth most incident cancer in the United States (USA), and its incidence is steadily growing.  has long been associated with thyroid cancer, raising critical questions about the role of immune cells in its pathogenesis. A plethora of immune cells and their mediators are present in the thyroid cancer ecosystem. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting immune checkpoints, such as mAbs anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4) and anti-programmed cell death protein-1/programmed cell death ligand-1 (anti-PD-1/PD-L1), have revolutionized the treatment of many malignancies, but they induce thyroid dysfunction in up to 10% of patients, presumably by enhancing autoimmunity. Combination strategies involving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with  kinase (TK) or serine/threonine protein kinase B-raf (BRAF) inhibitors are showing considerable promise in the treatment of advanced thyroid cancer.

Given the diverse and critical roles of Eph receptors and ephrin ligands throughout the immune system during both resting and activated states, this review aims to highlight the critical yet underappreciated roles of this family of signaling molecules in the immune system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31344396>An Immune Gene Expression Signature Associated With Development of Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Identifies Mice That Respond to Chemopreventive Agents.</a></h2><p>Cirrhosis and chronic  precede development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in approximately 80% of cases. We investigated immune-related gene expression patterns in liver tissues surrounding early-stage HCCs and chemopreventive agents that might alter these patterns to prevent liver tumorigenesis.We analyzed gene expression profiles of nontumor liver tissues from 392 patients with early-stage HCC (training set, N = 167 and validation set, N = 225) and liver tissue from patients with cirrhosis without HCC (N = 216, controls) to identify changes in expression of genes that regulate the immune response that could contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis. We defined 172 genes as markers for this deregulated immune response, which we called the immune-mediated cancer field (ICF). We analyzed the expression data of liver tissues from 216 patients with cirrhosis without HCC and investigated the association between this gene expression signature and development of HCC and outcomes of patients (median follow-up, 10 years). Human liver tissues were also analyzed by histology. C57BL/6J mice were given a single injection of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) followed by weekly doses of carbon tetrachloride to induce liver fibrosis and tumorigenesis. Mice were then orally given the multiple  inhibitor nintedanib or vehicle (controls); liver tissues were collected and histology, transcriptome, and protein analyses were performed. We also analyzed transcriptomes of liver tissues collected from mice on a choline-deficient high-fat diet, which developed chronic liver  and tumors, orally given aspirin and clopidogrel or the anti-inflammatory agent sulindac vs mice on a chow (control) diet.We found the ICF gene expression pattern in 50% of liver tissues from patients with cirrhosis without HCC and in 60% of nontumor liver tissues from patients with early-stage HCC. The liver tissues with the ICF gene expression pattern had 3 different features: increased numbers of effector T cells; increased expression of genes that suppress the immune response and activation of transforming growth factor β signaling; or expression of genes that promote  and activation of interferon gamma signaling. Patients with cirrhosis and liver tissues with the immunosuppressive profile (10% of cases) had a higher risk of HCC (hazard ratio, 2.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-4.80). Mice with chemically induced fibrosis or diet-induced steatohepatitis given nintedanib or aspirin and clopidogrel down-regulated the ICF gene expression pattern in liver and developed fewer and smaller tumors than mice given vehicle.We identified an immune-related gene expression pattern in liver tissues of patients with early-stage HCC, called the ICF, that is associated with risk of HCC development in patients with cirrhosis. Administration of nintedanib or aspirin and clopidogrel to mice with chronic liver  caused loss of this gene expression pattern and development of fewer and smaller liver tumors. Agents that alter immune regulatory gene expression patterns associated with carcinogenesis might be tested as chemopreventive agents in patients with cirrhosis.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

One such stimulus was given to adult male Wistar rats by injecting different concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 50, 300, 500 g/kg and 5 mg/kg i.p.). To verify the systemic effect of the LPS administration, the serum content of C-reactive protein (CRP), the variation of body weight and cellular changes in the spleen, liver and kidney were determined. Motor impairment was evaluated by rotarod and open field tests. Microglia activation and dopaminergic degeneration was confirmed by immunolabelling for CD11b/c (microglia) and  hydroxylase (TH), respectively. The cell counting was performed in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), microglial activation was explored in SNpc, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr), substantia nigra pars compacta dorsal (SNcd) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). For the statistical analysis, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc test (p ≤ 0.05) was used. On day 7 post intraperitoneal administration of LPS, cellular atrophy was detected in the liver, kidney and spleen at 5 mg/kg, without significant changes in CRP levels. Body weight loss and motor impairment was present only on day 1 post LPS administration. The dosage of 500 g/kg and 5 mg/kg of LPS caused the loss of dopaminergic neurons (40%) in SNpc and microglia migration in a dose-dependent manner in SNcd, SNpc and SNpr. LPS-induced endotoxemia favours damage to the peripheral organs and microglial migration in a dose-dependent manner in rat substantia nigra.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471375>Filamin A: key actor in platelet biology.</a></h2><p>Filamins (FLNs) are large dimeric actin binding proteins regulating actin cytoskeleton remodeling. In addition FLNs serve as scaffolds for signaling proteins such as  kinases, GTPases or phosphatases, as well as for adhesive receptors such as integrins. They thus connect adhesive receptors to signaling pathways and to cytoskeleton. There are 3 isoforms of FLNs (FLNa, FLNb, FLNc) originating from 3 homologous genes. FLNa has been the recent focus of attention because its mutations are responsible for a wide spectrum of defects, called filaminopathies A, affecting brain (peri-ventricular nodular heterotopia or PVNH), heart (valve defect), skeleton, gastro-intestinal tract or more recently, the megakaryocytic lineage. This review will focus on the physiological and pathological role of FLNa in platelets. Indeed, FLNa mutations alter platelet production from their bone marrow precursors, the megakaryocytes, yielding giant platelets in reduced number (macrothrombocytopenia). In platelet , FLNa mutations may either lead to impaired alphaIIbbeta3 integrin activation or in contrast, increased alphaIIbbeta3 activation, potentially enhancing the risk of thrombosis. Experimental work delineating the interaction of FLNa with its platelet partners, including alphabeta, the von Willebrand receptor GPIb-IX-V, the  kinase Syk and the signaling pathway of the collagen receptor GPVI will also be reviewed.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Hematology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31261895>Preventive Effects of Tryptophan-Methionine Dipeptide on Neural  and Alzheimer's Pathology.</a></h2><p>Preventive approaches for age-related memory decline and dementia have become a high priority in the aging society because of the lack of therapeutic approaches. Recent epidemiological studies have reported that fermented dairy products can help prevent dementia. Previously, we identified tryptophan- (WY) and tryptophan-methionine (WM) peptides as the suppressants of activation of the primary microglia and showed that WY peptide consumption suppresses  in the brains of Alzheimer's disease model mice. However, the effects of the WM peptide on  in the brain and Alzheimer's pathology have not been investigated. Here, we evaluated the effect of WM peptide consumption on Alzheimer's disease model (5×FAD) mice. In 5×FAD mice, intake of WM peptide suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines, activation of microglia, and infiltration of activated microglia around β amyloid (Aβ) depositions. WM peptide intake reduced Aβ deposition in the cortex and hippocampus and then improved the object recognition memory. Taken together with previous reports, the current findings indicate that ingestion of tryptophan-related peptides or food material rich in tryptophan-related peptides, thereby regulating microglial activity, represents a potential preventive approach for cognitive decline and dementia related to .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481496>Serine-Phosphorylated STAT3 Promotes Tumorigenesis via Modulation of RNA Polymerase Transcriptional Activity.</a></h2><p>Deregulated activation of the latent oncogenic transcription factor STAT3 in many human epithelial malignancies, including gastric cancer, has invariably been associated with its canonical  phosphorylation and enhanced transcriptional activity. By contrast, serine phosphorylation (pS) of STAT3 can augment its nuclear transcriptional activity and promote essential mitochondrial functions, yet the role of pS-STAT3 among epithelial cancers is ill-defined. Here, we reveal that genetic ablation of pS-STAT3 in the   spontaneous gastric cancer mouse model and human gastric cancer cell line xenografts abrogated tumor growth that coincided with reduced proliferative potential of the tumor epithelium. Microarray gene expression profiling demonstrated that the suppressed gastric tumorigenesis in pS-STAT3-deficient   mice associated with reduced transcriptional activity of STAT3-regulated gene networks implicated in cell proliferation and migration, , and angiogenesis, but not mitochondrial function or metabolism. Notably, the protumorigenic activity of pS-STAT3 aligned with its capacity to primarily augment RNA polymerase II-mediated transcriptional elongation, but not initiation, of STAT3 target genes. Furthermore, by using a combinatorial  and  proteomics approach based on the rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous protein (RIME) assay, we identified RuvB-like AAA ATPase 1 (RUVBL1/Pontin) and enhancer of rudimentary homolog (ERH) as interacting partners of pS-STAT3 that are pivotal for its transcriptional activity on STAT3 target genes. Collectively, these findings uncover a hitherto unknown transcriptional role and obligate requirement for pS-STAT3 in gastric cancer that could be extrapolated to other STAT3-driven cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings reveal a new transcriptional role and mandatory requirement for constitutive STAT3 serine phosphorylation in gastric cancer.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31468585>SCIMP is a universal Toll-like receptor adaptor in macrophages.</a></h2><p>In innate immune cells, pathogens and danger signals activate TLRs, unleashing potent and tailored inflammatory responses. Previously, we reported that an immune-specific transmembrane adaptor, SLP adaptor and CSK interacting membrane protein (SCIMP), interacts with TLR4 via direct binding to its cytoplasmic TIR domain. SCIMP scaffolds a Src family kinase, Lyn, for TLR4 phosphorylation and activation. Consequently, SCIMP is able to direct selective production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-12p40 downstream of TLR4 in macrophages. Here, we set out to investigate whether SCIMP also acts as an adaptor for other TLR family members. We report here that SCIMP is phosphorylated and activated in response to agonists of multiple TLRs, including TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR9. SCIMP also interacts with TLRs that are known to signal from both the cell surface and endosomal compartments. In so doing, this transmembrane adaptor presents Lyn, along with other effectors such as Grb2, Csk, and SLP65, to multiple TLRs during cellular activation. CRISPR-mediated knockout or silencing of SCIMP in macrophages alters TLR signaling outputs and the production of IL-6 and IL-12p40 downstream of multiple TLRs, and upon challenge with live bacteria. Furthermore, the selectivity in cytokine responses is preserved downstream of TLR3, with inducible expression of Il-12p40 and IL-6, but not IFNβ, being SCIMP dependent. SCIMP is thus a universal TLR adaptor for scaffolding the Lyn  kinase and its effectors to enable responses against a wide range of danger signals.©2019 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31490028>Tackling endothelium remodeling in cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>Endothelial dysfunction is considered an early marker of atherosclerosis. Herein, we address the molecular mechanisms affecting endothelium remodeling in disease. Vascular calcification is highly prevalent in patients with ischemic cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disorder, and renal failure, being a common feature in aging, diabetes, dyslipidemia, abnormal valve biomechanics, end-stage renal disease and atherosclerosis, a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Oxidative stress promotes calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) by increasing osteogenic transcription factors expression and activity in atherosclerotic plaques. Various markers of osteogenic differentiation are expressed by SMC in calcified atherosclerotic lesions. Interestingly, decreased levels of some bone factors and microRNAs accelerate vascular calcification and injured tissue regeneration. Another key player in endothelial remodeling is amino acids metabolism. Branched-chain amino acids are catabolized in several nonhepatic tissues including cardiac muscle. Immune activation and  in cardiovascular disease patients associate with higher phenylalanine/ ratios. Understanding the whole process that underlies endothelium dysfunction is of paramount importance for the development of new therapeutic approaches.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187953>Dasatinib-induced nephrotic syndrome: a case of phenoconversion.</a></h2><p>We present the case of a 33-year-old chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) female patient, in whom the occurrence of nephrotic syndrome, during the treatment with  kinase activity inhibitors (TKIs), was potentially influenced by transient phenoconversion. Seven years after the CML diagnosis in 2004 and complete response, the patient experienced pain in the mandible and extremities. After this, imatinib was replaced by nilotinib, but generalized maculopapular rash was presented and successfully treated with antihistamines. The therapy was then discontinued due to planned pregnancy, and the patient experienced a relapse of CML with BCR-ABL/ABL1 transcripts of 18.9%. Dasatinib was introduced, and CML was in remission. Two years later, urine protein levels (6.19 g/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated (ESR=90 mm/3.6 ks). The patient was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome. With dasatinib dose reduction, urine protein level returned to the reference range. In order to determine the best genotype-guided therapy, the patient underwent pharmacogenomic testing, showing a homozygous CYP3A4 genotype *1/*1, associated with extensive metabolizer (EM) enzyme phenotype, typical for normal rates of drug metabolism for TKIs. However, this was inconsistent with nephrotic syndrome occurrence. A possible explanation would be CYP3A4 EM genotype coding a poor metabolizer enzyme phenotype, leading to the drug accumulation in the patient's blood. This transient phenoconversion can be explained by  with elevated ESR during nephrotic syndrome. This case shows that a broader approach that recognizes genetic, clinical, and epigenomic factors is required for a quality decision on the personalized therapy regimen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678514>Wnt5a/Ror2 pathway contributes to the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis and inflammatory response in atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis (AS) is characterized by lipids metabolism disorder and inflammatory response. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that Wingless type 5a (Wnt5a) is implicated in cardiovascular diseases through non-canonical Wnt cascades. However, its precise role during the pathogenesis of AS is still unclear. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the role and the underlying mechanism of Wnt5a/receptor  kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2) pathways in the promotion of AS process through affecting lipid accumulation and . In atherosclerotic clinical samples, Wnt5a levels were measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. In vivo experiments were conducted by using apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE) mice model. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were applied for in vitro studies. Wnt5a was highly expressed in both of atherosclerotic clinical samples and apoE mice. The knockdown of Wnt5a significantly inhibited cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory response. Additionally, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced  aggravated the cholesterol accumulation and decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression in VSMCs. Depletion of intracellular cholesterol by β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) led to the upregulation of ABCA1 and the inhibition of . Conversely, the overexpression of Wnt5a inhibited ABCA1 expression, facilitated cholesterol accumulation, impared cholesterol efflux, promoted NF-κB nuclear translocation and the inflammatory cytokines secretion. Moreover, the knockdown of Ror2 increased ABCA1 expression and reduced Wnt5a-induced cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, the knockdown of ABCA1 enhanced cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory response. Therefore, Wnt5a/Ror2 pathway was critical in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and inflammatory response, which might be a promising therapeutic target for AS therapy.Copyright © 2019.

Foreign protein and foreign DNA are known inducers of , which is also true in the immune-privileged ocular environment. We explored which component(s) of AAV vectors, viral capsid, or viral DNA drive inflammatory responses. Recombinant AAV with three  to phenylalanine substitutions in the capsid of AAV serotype 2 (rAAV2tYF), and with a generic ubiquitous promoter (cytomegalovirus [CMV]) controlling the expression of humanized green fluorescent protein (hGFP), was processed to enrich for AAV capsids containing genome (full capsids), capsids without genome (empty capsids), and residual material. Nonhuman primate eyes were injected by IVT in both eyes. During in-life, ocular  and development of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were measured. Following termination, lymph node immunophenotyping was performed, vitreous was processed for cytokine and RNAseq analyses, and ocular sections were assessed for transgene expression (by  hybridization) and histopathology. IVT dosing of AAV vectors transiently raised cellular  in the aqueous and induced a more sustained  in the vitreous. Lowering the total capsid dose by removing empty AAV capsids reduced  and improved viral transduction. IVT dosing of AAV induced systemic NAb to AAV irrespective of the vector preparation.

Nonsurgically treated P-ADC patients usually have more advanced or complex conditions, which remain poorly understood and pose a major challenge in clinical management. We aimed to describe the clinical profiles and prognosis of non-surgically treated P-ADC patients. We enrolled 71 patients with pathologically proven P-ADC from a university hospital in China. Clinical and laboratory data were retrieved from medical record. Their median age was 62 years, including 45% men and 35% smokers. Clinical manifestations were dominated by cough, sputum, and dyspnea. Main chest imaging features included nodules, shadow, consolidation, and air bronchogram. Nearly half or more of patients showed higher levels of  and cancer biomarkers including cytokeratin-19-fragment (CYFRA 21-1) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Majority of patients were classified at the stage IIIB or IV. Palliative care was the most popular treatment option but provided a shorter overall survival compared to  kinase inhibitor therapy, standard chemotherapy, and sequential therapy while there were no significant differences in the survival among the latter 3 options. Higher serum CEA was associated with longer survival and better prognosis while higher serum CYFRA 21-1 could predict a poor prognosis. Detailed understanding the clinical characteristics and prognostic factors in nonsurgically treated P-ADC may allow the identification of patients with particular risk factors and initiation of early and specific treatment in order to optimize outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31321245> Genotypic Variant  and Increased  Phosphorylation of STAT3 in IL-23 Responsive Innate Lymphoid Cells during Pathogenesis of Crohn's Disease.</a></h2><p>Crohn's disease (CD) results from dysregulated immune responses to gut microbiota in genetically susceptible individuals, affecting multiple areas of the gastrointestinal tract. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are tissue-resident innate effector lymphocytes which play crucial roles in mucosal immune defense, tissue repair, and maintenance of homeostasis. The accumulation of IFN--producing ILC1s and increased level of proinflammatory cytokines produced by ILCs has been observed in the inflamed terminal ileum of CD patients. To date, the precise mechanisms of ILC plasticity and gene regulatory pathways in ILCs remain unclear. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) regulates gene expression in a cell-specific, cytokine-dependent manner, involving multiple immune responses. This study proposes the positive correlation between the prevalence of  risky allele "A" with the severity of disease in a cohort of 94 CD patients. In addition, the results suggest an increased STAT3 activity in the inflamed ileum of CD patients, compared to unaffected ileum sections. Notably, IL-23 triggers the differentiation of CD117NKp44 ILC3s and induces the activation of STAT3 in both CD117NKp44 and CD117NKp44 ILC subsets, implying the involvement of STAT3 in the initiation of ILC plasticity. Moreover, carriage of  "A" risk allele exhibited a higher basal level of STAT3  phosphorylation, and an increased IL-23 triggered the pSTAT3 level. We also demonstrated that there was no delayed dephosphorylation of STAT3 in ILCs of both A/A and G/G donors. Overall, the results of this study suggest that IL-23-induced activation of STAT3 in the CD117NKp44 ILC1s involves in ILC1-to-ILC3 plasticity and a potential regulatory role of ILC1 function. Those genetically susceptible individuals carried  risky allele appear to have higher basal and cytokine-stimulated activation of STAT3 signal, leading to prolonged  and chronic relapse.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636733>TAM Receptor Pathways at the Crossroads of Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence suggests that pathogenic mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration are strongly linked with neuroinflammatory responses. Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk (TAM receptors) constitute a subgroup of the receptor  kinase family, cell surface receptors which transmit signals from the extracellular space to the cytoplasm and nucleus. TAM receptors and the corresponding ligands, Growth Arrest Specific 6 and Protein S, are expressed in different tissues, including the nervous system, playing complex roles in tissue repair,  and cell survival, proliferation, and migration. In the nervous system, TAM receptor signalling modulates neurogenesis and neuronal migration, synaptic plasticity, microglial activation, phagocytosis, myelination, and peripheral nerve repair, resulting in potential interest in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Multiple Sclerosis. In Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, a role of TAM receptors in neuronal survival and pathological protein aggregate clearance has been suggested, while in Multiple Sclerosis TAM receptors are involved in myelination and demyelination processes. To better clarify roles and pathways involving TAM receptors may have important therapeutic implications, given the fine modulation of multiple molecular processes which could be reached. In this review, we summarise the roles of TAM receptors in the central nervous system, focusing on the regulation of immune responses and microglial activities and analysing in vitro and in vivo studies regarding TAM signalling involvement in neurodegeneration.Copyright © 2019 Giacomo Tondo et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462456>Isoliquiritigenin, an Orally Available Natural FLT3 Inhibitor from Licorice, Exhibits Selective Anti-Acute Myeloid Leukemia Efficacy In Vitro and In Vivo.</a></h2><p>Licorice is a medicinal herb widely used to treat -related diseases in China. Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) is an important constituent of licorice and possesses multiple bioactivities. In this study, we examined the selective anti-AML (acute myeloid leukemia) property of ISL via targeting FMS-like  kinase-3 (FLT3), a certified valid target for treating AML. In vitro, ISL potently inhibited FLT3 kinase, with an IC value of 115.1 ± 4.2 nM, and selectively inhibited the proliferation of FLT3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) or FLT3-ITD/F691L mutant AML cells. Moreover, it showed very weak activity toward other tested cell lines or kinases. Western blot immunoassay revealed that ISL significantly inhibited the activation of FLT3/Erk1/2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) signal in AML cells. Meanwhile, a molecular docking study indicated that ISL could stably form aromatic interactions and hydrogen bonds within the kinase domain of FLT3. In vivo, oral administration of ISL significantly inhibited the MV4-11 flank tumor growth and prolonged survival in the bone marrow transplant model via decreasing the expression of Ki67 and inducing apoptosis. Taken together, the present study identified a novel function of ISL as a selective FLT3 inhibitor. ISL could also be a potential natural bioactive compound for treating AML with FLT3-ITD or FLT3-ITD/F691L mutations. Thus, ISL and licorice might possess potential therapeutic effects for treating AML, providing a new strategy for anti-AML.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116646>A single  phosphorylation site in cortactin is important for filopodia formation in neuronal growth cones.</a></h2><p>Cortactin is a Src  phosphorylation substrate that regulates multiple actin-related cellular processes. While frequently studied in nonneuronal cells, the functions of cortactin in neuronal growth cones are not well understood. We recently reported that cortactin mediates the effects of Src  kinase in regulating actin organization and dynamics in both lamellipodia and filopodia of  growth cones. Here, we identified a single cortactin  phosphorylation site (Y499) to be important for the formation of filopodia. Overexpression of a 499F phospho-deficient cortactin mutant decreased filopodia length and density, whereas overexpression of a 499E phospho-mimetic mutant increased filopodia length. Using an antibody against cortactin pY499, we showed that -phosphorylated cortactin is enriched along the leading edge. The leading edge localization of phosphorylated cortactin is Src2-dependent, F-actin-independent, and important for filopodia formation. In vitro kinase assays revealed that Src2 phosphorylates cortactin at Y499, although Y505 is the preferred site in vitro. Finally, we provide evidence that Arp2/3 complex acts downstream of phosphorylated cortactin to regulate density but not length of filopodia. In conclusion, we have characterized a  phosphorylation site in  cortactin that plays a major role in the Src/cortactin/Arp2/3 signaling pathway controlling filopodia formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31427888>Role of the Btk-PLC2 Signaling Pathway in the Bone Destruction of Apical Periodontitis.</a></h2><p>Chronic apical periodontitis is characterized by alveolar bone absorption in the apical region and is the result of the participation of various inflammatory mediators. Studies have shown that the Bruton  kinase- (Btk-) phospholipase C2 (PLC2) signaling pathway plays an important role in bone absorption, but it is unknown whether it plays a role in apical periodontitis bone destruction. Therefore, this study verified the role of Btk and PLC2 in bone resorption of apical periodontitis by  and  experiments. In the  experiment, a mice model of apical periodontitis was established; apical bone resorption was confirmed by the numbers of osteoclasts and HE staining. Btk, PLC2, and nuclear factor of activated T-cells 1 (NFATc-1) were detected by immunohistochemical staining. In the  experiment, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were used to stimulate osteoclast precursor cell RAW264.7 to establish an inflammatory microenvironment and detect osteoclast differentiation. By silencing Btk, the expression of Btk, PLC2, and NFATc-1 was detected by real-time qPCR and Western blot, and osteoclastogenesis was detected by enzyme histochemical staining to further confirm the role of Btk in bone resorption. It was found that the expression of Btk, PLC2, and NFATc-1 changed significantly with the progression of  and bone destruction, indicating that Btk and PLC2 may be involved in the progression of  in apical periodontitis and bone absorption.  experiments confirmed that the differentiation of osteoclasts and the expression of PLC2 and NFATc-1 were significantly inhibited after silencing Btk expression, but osteoclast precursor cells could be differentiated due to the proinflammatory factor lipopolysaccharide.

Nei-like 1 (NEIL1) is one of four mammalian DNA glycosylases involved in the progression of various diseases, including neuroinflammation. However, it is still unknown if the expression changes of NEIL1 could contribute to PD progression. In the present study, we established mouse model with PD using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to explore the effects of NEIL1 on PD development. Here, we found that NEIL1 deletion significantly promoted the motor dysfunction in the wild type mice treated with 6-OHDA. Furthermore, DA neuronal loss was further accelerated by NEIL1 deletion in 6-OHDA-injected mice, as evidenced by the significantly reduced expression of  hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT). Furthermore, in PD mice induced by MPTP, remarkably reduced expression of NEIL1 was observed in nigra and striatum of mice. A strong positive correlation was detected in the expression of NEIL1 and the survival rate of DA neurons. Also, NEIL1 ablation further elevated the DA neuronal loss in MPTP-treated mice, accompanied with higher glial activation, as evidenced by the obvious up-regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Ionized calcium-Binding Adapter molecule 1 (Iba1). Moreover, MPTP-triggered  was highly aggravated by the loss of NEIL1 through inducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In contrast, promoting NEIL1 expression effectively reversedPD progression induced by MPTP in mice. Together, these results demonstrated that NEIL1 insufficiency might be a contributing factor for the progression of PD, which therefore could be considered as a novel candidate to develop effective treatments against PD progression.Copyright © 2019.

The growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6) protein is known to induce dynamic cellular responses and is elevated in PE. Gas6 binds to the AXL  kinase receptor and AXL-mediated signaling is implicated in proliferation and migration observed in several tissues. Our laboratory utilized Gas6 to induce preeclamptic-like conditions in pregnant rats. Our objective was to determine the role of Gas6/AXL signaling as a possible model of PE. Briefly, pregnant rats were divided into 3 groups that received daily intraperitoneal injections (from gestational day 7.5-17.5) of PBS, Gas6, or Gas6 + R428 (an AXL inhibitor administered from gestational day 13.5-17.5). Animals dispensed Gas6 experienced elevated blood pressure, increased proteinuria, augmented caspase-3 mediated placental apoptosis and diminished trophoblast invasion. Gas6 also enhanced expression of several PE related genes and a number of inflammatory mediators. Gas6 further enhanced placental oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial respiration. Each of these PE related characteristics were ameliorated in dams and/or their placentae when AXL inhibition by R428 occurred in tandem with Gas6 treatment. We conclude that Gas6 signaling is capable of inducing PE and that inhibition of AXL prevents disease progression in pregnant rats. These results provide insight into pathways associated with PE that could be useful in the clarification of potential therapeutic approaches.© The Author(s) 2019.

S7-L3-3 purified from SE-EE showed enhanced in vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity. The isolated S7-L3-3 was identified and characterized as Aca.B using varied spectral analyses, i.e., Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), and Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). In the in vitro studies, Aca.B exhibited negligible toxicity and showed a dose-dependent nitric oxide inhibitory potential in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells. In the in vivo studies, the oral administration of Aca.B to mice showed enhanced bioavailability and dose-dependent repression of the behavioral/cognitive impairment by regulating the cholinergic function, restoring the antioxidant status, attenuating the inflammatory cytokines/mediators and actively enriching neurotropic proteins in the hippocampal regions of the scopolamine-administered mice.Copyright © 2019.

Spleen  kinase (Syk) is known to be involved in regulation of such  response and thereby rendering its inevitable importance among asthma patients. DNA extraction followed by PCR and sequencing was performed for genomic analysis, mRNA analysis was done by RT PCR whereas Western blot and ELISA was used for protein study. Image J and UNAFOLD were also used for Bioinformatics analysis.The mean age of patients and controls were 31.1±9.3 and 30.4±6.1 years respectively. Results of sequencing showed nonsense exonic mutations in exon 3 at g.25710G>A and g.25722GA positions. Substitution mutations in introns were also found at g.25827G>A (intron 3), g.63425C>T (intron 8) and g.63445T>G (intron 8). Significantly increased levels of IgE and significantly decreased expression of Syk at transcriptional level was found in patients compared to controls. The western blot results of asthmatic samples and healthy controls revealed that Syk has comparatively low expression in diseased individual's PBMCs.  has been found to be altered in DNA, mRNA and protein expression in asthma patients among Pakistani population therefore patients should be treated according to their Syk status for more effective recovery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581487>Protein Oxidation Biomarkers and Myeloperoxidase Activation in Cerebrospinal Fluid in Childhood Bacterial Meningitis.</a></h2><p>The immunological response in bacterial meningitis (BM) causes the formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS) and activates myeloperoxidase (MPO), an inflammatory enzyme. Thus, structural oxidative and nitrosative damage to proteins and DNA occurs. We aimed to asses these events in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of pediatric BM patients. Phenylalanine (Phe), para- (p-Tyr), nucleoside 2'-deoxiguanosine (2dG), and biomarkers of ROS/RNS-induced protein and DNA oxidation: ortho- (o-Tyr), 3-chlorotyrosine (3Cl-Tyr), 3-nitrotyrosine (3NO₂-Tyr) and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG), concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in the initial CSF of 79 children with BM and 10 without BM. All biomarkers, normalized with their corresponding precursors, showed higher median concentrations ( < 0.0001) in BM compared with controls, except 8OHdG/2dG. The ratios o-Tyr/Phe, 3Cl-Tyr/p-Tyr and 3NO₂-Tyr/p-Tyr were 570, 20 and 4.5 times as high, respectively. A significantly higher 3Cl-Tyr/p-Tyr ratio was found in BM caused by , than by  type b, or  ( = 0.002 for both).

There are three broadly defined categories of cell death processes: apoptosis (Type I), autophagic cell death (Type II), and necrosis (Type III). In hematopoietic tumor cells, the majority of toxic stimuli cause these cells to undergo a death process called apoptosis; apoptosis specifically involves the cleavage of DNA into large defined pieces and their subsequent localization in vesicles. Thus, 'pure' apoptosis largely lacks inflammatory potential. In carcinomas, however, the mechanisms by which tumor cells ultimately die are considerably more complex. Although the machinery of apoptosis is engaged by toxic stimuli, other processes such as autophagy ("self-eating") and replicative cell death can lead to observations that do not simplistically correspond to any of the individual Type I-III formalized death categories. The 'hybrid' forms of cell death observed in carcinoma cells result in cellular materials being released into the extracellular space without packaging, which promotes , potentially leading to the accelerated re-growth of surviving tumor cells by macrophages. Drugs as single agents or in combinations can simultaneously initiate signaling via both apoptotic and autophagic pathways. Based on the tumor type and its oncogene drivers, as well as the drug(s) being used and the duration and intensity of the autophagosome signal, apoptosis and autophagy have the potential to act in concert to kill or alternatively that the actions of either pathway can act to suppress signaling by the other pathway. And, there also is evidence that autophagic flux, by causing lysosomal protease activation, with their subsequent release into the cytosol, can directly mediate killing. This review will discuss the interactive biology between apoptosis and autophagy in carcinoma cells. Finally, the molecular actions of the FDA-approved drugs neratinib and sorafenib, and how they enhance both apoptotic and toxic autophagic processes, alone or in combination with other agents, is discussed in a bench-to-bedside manner.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

These processes are critically involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory-based disorders of the gut, like inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Accordingly, our aim was to investigate the role of the EphB/ephrin-B system in intestinal  by assessing the local and systemic effects produced by its pharmacological manipulation in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)- (Th1-dependent model) and dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)- (innate response model) induced colitis in mice. To this purpose, we administered chimeric Fc-conjugated proteins, allegedly able to uni-directionally activate either forward (ephrin-B1-Fc) or reverse (EphB1-Fc) signaling, and the soluble monomeric EphB4 extracellular domain protein, that, simultaneously interfering with both signaling pathways, acts as EphB/ephrin-B antagonist.The blockade of the EphB/ephrin-B forward signaling by EphB4 and EphB1-Fc was ineffective against DSS-induced colitis while it evoked remarkable beneficial effects against TNBS colitis: it counteracted all the evaluated inflammatory responses and the changes elicited on splenic T lymphocytes subpopulations, without preventing the appearance of a splice variant of ephrin-B2 gene elicited by the haptenating agent in the colon. Interestingly, EphB4, preferentially displacing EphB4/ephrin-B2 interaction over EphB1/ephrin-B1 binding, was able to promote Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) release by splenic mononuclear cells . On the whole, the collected results point to a potential role of the EphB/ephrin-B system as a pharmacological target in intestinal inflammatory disorders and suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of its blockade seemingly works through the modulation of immune responses, independent of the changes at the transcriptional and translational level of EphB4 and ephrin-B2 genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399520>c-Abl-Mediated  Phosphorylation of PARP1 Is Crucial for Expression of Proinflammatory Genes.</a></h2><p>Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is a rapid and transient posttranslational protein modification mostly catalyzed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1). Fundamental roles of activated PARP1 in DNA damage repair and cellular response pathways are well established; however, the precise mechanisms by which PARP1 is activated independent of DNA damage, and thereby playing a role in expression of inflammatory genes, remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that, in response to LPS or TNF-α exposure, the nonreceptor  kinase c-Abl undergoes nuclear translocation and interacts with and phosphorylates PARP1 at the conserved Y829 site. -phosphorylated PARP1 is required for protein poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of RelA/p65 and NF-κB-dependent expression of proinflammatory genes in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages, human monocytic THP1 cells, or mouse lungs. Furthermore, LPS-induced airway lung  was reduced by inhibition of c-Abl activity. The present study elucidated a novel signaling pathway to activate PARP1 and regulate gene expression, suggesting that blocking the interaction of c-Abl with PARP1 or pharmaceutical inhibition of c-Abl may improve the outcomes of PARP1 activation-mediated inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415031>Update on the pathogenesis of central nervous system lupus.</a></h2><p>Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is an emerging frontier in lupus care encompassing a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Its pathogenesis remains poorly understood because of the complexity of pathophysiologic mechanisms involved and limited access to tissue. We highlight recent advances in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric lupus.Disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) facilitating entrance of neurotoxic antibodies into the central nervous system (CNS), neuroinflammation and cerebral ischemia are the key mechanisms. Disruption of the BBB may occur not only at the traditional BBB, but also at the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Certain autoantibodies, such as anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, antiribosomal P and antiphospholipid antibodies may cause injury in subsets of patients with diffuse neuropsychiatric disease. Activation of microglia via autoantibodies, interferon-a or other immune reactants, may amplify the inflammatory response and promote neuronal damage. New inflammatory pathways, such as TWEAK/Fn14, Bruton's  kinase, Nogo-a and ACE may represent additional potential targets of therapy.

Our previous work has shown that T-lymphocytes exposed to elevated levels of norepinephrine (NE) displayed a pro-inflammatory signature reminiscent of an autoreactive phenotype. With this, we hypothesized that the increased sympathetic tone observed during psychological trauma may be promoting pro-inflammatory T-lymphocytes, which causes a predisposition to comorbid inflammatory conditions. Here, we examined the consequences of psychological trauma on splenic T-lymphocytes using a mouse model of repeated social defeat stress. Social defeat led to anxiety-like and depression-like behavior as has been previously described. The spleens of socially-defeated mice showed significant elevations of NE,  hydroxylase (TH), and acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) levels, which appeared to be due in part to increased expression within T-lymphocytes. Additionally, T-lymphocytes from stressed animals showed higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mitochondrial superoxide. Interestingly, in this model system, close associations exist within splenic T-lymphocytes amid the autonomic, inflammatory, and redox environments, but these only weakly correlate with individual behavioral differences among animals suggesting the psychological and physiological manifestations of trauma may not be tightly coupled. Last, we describe, for the first time, elevations in calprotectin levels within T-lymphocytes and in circulation of psychologically stressed animals. Calprotectin correlated with both behavioral and physiological changes after social defeat, suggesting the potential for a new biological marker and/or therapeutic target for psychological trauma and its inflammatory comorbidities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31282857>Unique-region phosphorylation targets LynA for rapid degradation, tuning its expression and signaling in myeloid cells.</a></h2><p>The activity of Src-family kinases (SFKs), which phosphorylate immunoreceptor -based activation motifs (ITAMs), is a critical factor regulating myeloid-cell activation. We reported previously that the SFK LynA is uniquely susceptible to rapid ubiquitin-mediated degradation in macrophages, functioning as a rheostat regulating signaling (Freedman et al., 2015). We now report the mechanism by which LynA is preferentially targeted for degradation and how cell specificity is built into the LynA rheostat. Using genetic, biochemical, and quantitative phosphopeptide analyses, we found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl preferentially targets LynA via a phosphorylated  (Y32) in its unique region. This distinct mode of c-Cbl recognition depresses steady-state expression of LynA in macrophages derived from mice. Mast cells, however, express little c-Cbl and have correspondingly high LynA. Upon activation, mast-cell LynA is not rapidly degraded, and SFK-mediated signaling is amplified relative to macrophages. Cell-specific c-Cbl expression thus builds cell specificity into the LynA checkpoint.© 2019, Brian et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31229949>Novel phase I trial design to evaluate the addition of cediranib or selumetinib to preoperative chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer: the DREAMtherapy trial.</a></h2><p>The DREAMtherapy (Dual REctal Angiogenesis MEK inhibition radiotherapy) trial is a novel intertwined design whereby two  kinase inhibitors (cediranib and selumetinib) were independently evaluated with rectal chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in an efficient manner to limit the extended follow-up period often required for radiotherapy studies.Cediranib or selumetinib was commenced 10 days before and then continued with RT (45 Gy/25#/5 wks) and capecitabine (825 mg/m twice a day (BID)). When three patients in the cediranib 15-mg once daily (OD) cohort were in the surveillance period, recruitment to the selumetinib cohort commenced. This alternating schedule was followed throughout. Three cediranib (15, 20 and 30 mg OD) and two selumetinib cohorts (50 and 75 mg BID) were planned. Circulating and imaging biomarkers of /angiogenesis were evaluated.In case of cediranib, dose-limiting diarrhoea, fatigue and skin reactions were seen in the 30-mg OD cohort, and therefore, 20 mg OD was defined as the maximum tolerated dose. Forty-one percent patients achieved a clinical or pathological complete response (7/17), and 53% (9/17) had an excellent clinical or pathological response (ECPR). Significantly lower level of pre-treatment plasma tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) was found in patients who had an ECPR. In case of selumetinib, the 50-mg BID cohort was poorly tolerated (fatigue and diarrhoea); a reduced dose cohort of 75-mg OD was opened which was also poorly tolerated, and further recruitment was abandoned. Of the 12 patients treated, two attained an ECPR (17%).This novel intertwined trial design is an effective way to independently investigate multiple agents with radiotherapy. The combination of cediranib with CRT was well tolerated with encouraging efficacy. TNFα emerged as a potential predictive biomarker of response and warrants further evaluation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Fibrogenesis is a pathogenetic phenomenon which is involved in different chronic human diseases, accounting for a high burden of morbidity and mortality. Despite being triggered by different causative factors, fibrogenesis follows common pathways, the knowledge of which is, however, still unsatisfactory. This represents a significant limit for the development of effective antifibrotic drugs. In the present paper, we aimed to review the current evidence regarding the potential role played in fibrogenesis by growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6) and its receptors Tyro3 protein  kinase (Tyro3), Axl receptor  kinase (Axl), and Mer  kinase protooncogene (MerTK) (TAM).

Antibiotics are frequently prescribed for NSCLC patients in combination with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted treatment in the presence of infection. The association between antibiotic use and the efficacy of EGFR  kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) has not previously been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, the present study investigated whether antibiotics could affect the efficacy and toxicity of EGFR-TKI treatment, with the aim of restricting the use of antibiotics in combination with targeted therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC in the near future. All patients received treatment with EGFR-TKIs until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or other factors, including death, pregnancy or unwillingness to further receive targeted therapy, were observed. Patients were retrospectively divided into two groups: Group A, which was treated with EGFR-TKIs and antibiotics; and Group B, which was treated with EGFR-TKIs alone. Patients having used antibiotics 6 months prior to EGFR-TKI therapy were also included in the study. Antibiotic use negatively affected the median progression-free survival (PFS) following EGFR-TKI treatment in NSCLC compared with that in patients not treated with antibiotics; median PFS in Group A was 6.6 months, whereas median PFS in Group B was 10.1 months. Antibiotics also increased the toxicity of targeted therapy for advanced NSCLC. There were significant statistical differences between the two groups in the occurrence of the adverse events of diarrhea and dyspnea. In conclusion, antibiotics decreased the efficacy of first-line targeted therapy in advanced NSCLC and increased incidences of diarrhea and dyspnea. Large randomized studies are needed to identify the impact of antibiotic use on EGFR-TKI treatment for NSCLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31259896>Nitropeptide Profiling and Identification Illustrated by Angiotensin II.</a></h2><p>Protein nitration is one of the most important post-translational modifications (PTM) on  residues and it can be induced by chemical actions of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in eukaryotic cells. Precise identification of nitration sites on proteins is crucial for understanding the physiological and pathological processes related to protein nitration, such as , aging, and cancer. Since the nitrated proteins are of low abundance in cells even under induced conditions, no universal and efficient methods have been developed for the profiling and identification of protein nitration sites. Here we describe a protocol for nitropeptide enrichment by using a chemical reduction reaction and biotin labeling, followed by high resolution mass spectrometry. In our method, nitropeptide derivatives can be identified with high accuracy. Our method exhibits two advantages compared to the previously reported methods. First, dimethyl labeling is used to block the primary amine on nitropeptides, which can be used to generate quantitative results. Second, a disulfide bond containing NHS-biotin reagent is used for the enrichment, which can be further reduced and alkylated to enhance the detection signal on a mass spectrometer.

To confirm the putative role of Mas receptor (MasR), the selective antagonist A779 was also injected intrastriatally prior to Ang 1-7 injections and a correlation analysis was performed between MasR expression and the assessed parameters. Ang 1-7 upregulated MasR expression to correlate strongly with the improved rotarod (r=0.95, p=0.003) and spontaneous activity task (r=0.99, p<0.0001). This correlation extends to involve other effects of Ang 1-7, such as the increased striatal dopamine content (r=0.98, p=0.0005), substantia nigra pars compacta  hydroxylase immune-reactivity (r=0.97, p=0.001), active pY705-STAT3 (r=0.99, p<0.0001) and SOCS3 (r=0.99, p<0.0001). Conversely, Ang 1-7 inhibited inflammatory markers to correlate negatively with NF-κBp65 (r= - 0.99, p<0.0003) and its downstream targets, high mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1; r= -0.97, p=0.002), receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE; r= -0.98, p=0.0004), and TNF-α (r=-0.99, p<0.0003), besides poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (r=-0.99, p=0.0002). In confirmation, the pre-administration of the selective MasR antagonist, A779, partially attenuated Ang 1-7-induced alterations towards 6-OHDA neurodegeneration. Collectively, our findings support a novel role for the anti-inflammatory capacity of the MasR axis to prove potential therapeutic relevance in PD via the upregulation/activation of MasR-dependent STAT3/SOCS3 cascade to negatively control the HMGB-1/RAGE/NF-κB axis hindering PD associated neuro- along with DA depletion and motor deficits.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the molecular mechanisms of carbon monoxide-releasing molecule (CORM)-2-induced HO-1 expression in human tracheal smooth muscle cells (HTSMCs) remain unknown. Here, we found that pretreatment with CORM-2 attenuated the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) expression and leukocyte count through the up-regulation of HO-1 in mice, which was revealed by immunohistochemistrical staining, Western blot, real-time PCR, and cell count. The inhibitory effects of HO-1 by CORM-2 were reversed by transfection with HO-1 siRNA. Next, Western blot, real-time PCR, and promoter activity assay were performed to examine the HO-1 induction in HTSMCs. We found that CORM-2 induced HO-1 expression via the activation of protein kinase C (PKC)α and proline-rich  kinase (Pyk2), which was mediated through Nox-derived ROS generation using pharmacological inhibitors or small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs). CORM-2-induced HO-1 expression was mediated through Nox-(1, 2, 4) or p47, which was confirmed by transfection with their own siRNAs. The Nox-derived ROS signals promoted the activities of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Subsequently, c-Fos and c-Jun-activator protein-1 (AP-1) subunits-were up-regulated by activated ERK1/2, which turned on transcription of the HO-1 gene by regulating the HO-1 promoter. These results suggested that in HTSMCs, CORM-2 activates PKCα/Pyk2-dependent Nox/ROS/ERK1/2/AP-1, leading to HO-1 up-regulation, which suppresses the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced airway .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31440390>Metabolomics Coupled with Transcriptomics Approach Deciphering Age Relevance in Sepsis.</a></h2><p>Sepsis is a severe disease frequently occurred in the Intenisive Care Unit (ICU), which has a very high morbidity and mortality, especially in patients aged over 65 years. Owing to the aging effect and the ensuing deterioration of body function, the elder patients may have atypical responses to sepsis. Diagnosis and pathogenesis of sepsis in this population are thus difficult, which hindered effective treatment and management in clinic. To investigated age effects on sepsis, 158 elderly septic patients and 71 non-septic elderly participants were enrolled, and their plasma samples were collected for transcriptomics (RNA-seq) and metabolomics (NMR and GC-MS) analyses, which are both increasingly being utilized to discover key molecular changes and potential biomarkers for various diseases. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was subsequently performed to assist cross-platform integration. Real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used for validation of RNA-seq results.

In many cases, these symptoms are observed years before motor impairments become apparent. Hence, the molecular and cellular underpinnings that contribute to this early GI dysfunction in PD have actively been explored using a relevant animal model. The MitoPark model is a chronic, progressive mouse model recapitulating several key pathophysiological aspects of PD. However, GI dysfunction and gut microbiome changes have not been categorized in this model. Herein, we show that decreased GI motility was one of the first non-motor symptoms to develop, evident as early as 8 weeks with significantly different transit times from 12 weeks onwards. These symptoms were observed well before motor symptoms developed, thereby paralleling PD progression in humans. At age 24 weeks, we observed increased colon transit time and reduced fecal water content, indicative of constipation. Intestinal  was evidenced with increased expression of iNOS and TNFα in the small and large intestine. Specifically, iNOS was observed mainly in the enteric plexi, indicating enteric glial cell activation. A pronounced loss of  hydroxylase-positive neurons occurred at 24 weeks both in the mid-brain region as well as the gut, leading to a corresponding decrease in dopamine (DA) production. We also observed decreased DARPP-32 expression in the colon, validating the loss of DAergic neurons in the gut. However, the total number of enteric neurons did not significantly differ between the two groups. Metabolomic gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of fecal samples showed increased sterol, glycerol, and tocopherol production in MitoPark mice compared to age-matched littermate controls at 20 weeks of age while 16 s microbiome sequencing showed a transient temporal increase in the genus Prevotella. Altogether, the data shed more light on the role of the gut dopaminergic system in maintaining intestinal health. Importantly, this model recapitulates the chronology and development of GI dysfunction along with other non-motor symptoms and can become an attractive translational animal model for pre-clinical assessment of the efficacy of new anti-Parkinsonian drugs that can alleviate GI dysfunction in PD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Although CSF-1 and IL-34 share the same receptor through which they trigger similar effects, IL-34 also binds to receptors protein- phosphatase (PTP)-ζ and syndecan-1. Thus, IL-34 is involved in several signaling pathways and participates in a wide array of biological actions. This review analyzes current studies on the role of IL-34 under physiological and pathological conditions, and explores its potential significance as a disease biomarker and therapeutic target. In physiological conditions, IL-34 expression is restricted to the microglia and Langerhans cells, with a fundamental role in cellular differentiation, adhesion and migration, proliferation, metabolism, and survival. It is released in response to inflammatory stimuli, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns or pro-inflammatory cytokines, with effects over various immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and regulatory T cells that shape the immune microenvironment. Over the past decade, accumulating evidence has suggested a potent immune regulation of IL-34 in pathological states such as autoimmune diseases, cancer, transplant rejection, neurologic diseases, infections, and inflammatory diseases. Importantly, IL-34 may hold great promise for acting as a biomarker for monitoring disease severity and progression, and may serve as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of several diseases in clinical settings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316206>Intestinal infection triggers Parkinson's disease-like symptoms in Pink1 mice.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder with motor symptoms linked to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra compacta. Although the mechanisms that trigger the loss of dopaminergic neurons are unclear, mitochondrial dysfunction and  are thought to have key roles. An early-onset form of Parkinson's disease is associated with mutations in the PINK1 kinase and PRKN ubiquitin ligase genes. PINK1 and Parkin (encoded by PRKN) are involved in the clearance of damaged mitochondria in cultured cells, but recent evidence obtained using knockout and knockin mouse models have led to contradictory results regarding the contributions of PINK1 and Parkin to mitophagy in vivo. It has previously been shown that PINK1 and Parkin have a key role in adaptive immunity by repressing presentation of mitochondrial antigens, which suggests that autoimmune mechanisms participate in the aetiology of Parkinson's disease. Here we show that intestinal infection with Gram-negative bacteria in Pink1 mice engages mitochondrial antigen presentation and autoimmune mechanisms that elicit the establishment of cytotoxic mitochondria-specific CD8 T cells in the periphery and in the brain. Notably, these mice show a sharp decrease in the density of dopaminergic axonal varicosities in the striatum and are affected by motor impairment that is reversed after treatment with L-DOPA. These data support the idea that PINK1 is a repressor of the immune system, and provide a pathophysiological model in which intestinal infection acts as a triggering event in Parkinson's disease, which highlights the relevance of the gut-brain axis in the disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31197506>Effects of a formula with a probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis Supplement on the gut microbiota of low birth weight infants.</a></h2><p>Low birth weight (LBW) infants have a less diverse gut microbiota, enriched in potential pathogens, which places them at high risk of systemic  diseases. This study aimed to identify the differences in gut bacterial community structure between LBW infants who received probiotics and LBW infants who did not receive probiotics.Forty-one infants were allocated to the non-probiotic group (N group) and 56 infants to the probiotic group (P group), according to whether the formula they received contained a probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis. Gut bacterial composition was identified with sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in fecal samples collected at 14 days after birth.There was no significant difference between the alpha diversity of the two groups, while the beta diversity was significantly different (p < 0.05). Our results showed that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus (both p < 0.05) were enriched in the P group, while Veillonella, Dolosigranulum and Clostridium sensu stricto 1 (all p < 0.05) were enriched in the N group. Predicted metagenome function analysis revealed enhancement of fatty acids, peroxisome, starch, alanine,  and peroxisome pathways in the P group, and enhancement of plant pathogen, Salmonella and Helicobacter pylori infection pathways in the N group.Probiotic supplement in formula may affect the composition, stability and function of LBW infants' gut microbiota. LBW infants who receive probiotic intervention may benefit from gut microbiota that contains more beneficial bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574898>Plasma Metabolic Signature and Abnormalities in HIV-Infected Individuals on Long-Term Successful Antiretroviral Therapy.</a></h2><p>Targeted metabolomics studies reported metabolic abnormalities in both treated and untreated people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLHIV). The present study aimed to understand the plasma metabolomic changes and predicted the risk of accelerated aging in PLHIV on long-term suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a case-control study setting and its association with the plasma proteomics biomarkers of  and neurological defects. Plasma samples were obtained from PLHIV on successful long-term ART for more than five years ( = 22) and matched HIV-negative healthy individuals ( = 22, HC herein). Untargeted metabolite profiling was carried out using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS/MS). Plasma proteomics profiling was performed using proximity extension assay targeting 184 plasma proteins. A total of 250 metabolites differed significantly ( < 0.05,  < 0.1) between PLHIV and HC. Plasma levels of several essential amino acids except for histidine, branched-chain amino acids, and aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, , tryptophan) were significantly lower in PLHIV compared to HC. Machine-learning prediction of metabolite changes indicated a higher risk of inflammatory and neurological diseases in PLHIV. Metabolic abnormalities were observed in amino-acid levels, energetics, and phospholipids and complex lipids, which may reflect known differences in lipoprotein levels in PLHIV that can resemble metabolic syndrome (MetS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31232472>MicroRNA-190 alleviates neuronal damage and inhibits neuroinflammation via Nlrp3 in MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mouse model.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is neurodegenerative dyskinesia characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Although neuroinflammation is one of the pathological features of PD, its mechanism of promoting PD is still not fully understood. Recently, the microRNA (miR) is considered to play a critical regulatory role in inflammatory responses. In this study, we examined the anti-inflammatory activity, antineuronal injury, and the underlying target of miR-190 with MPTP-induced PD mouse model and BV2 cells. The results showed that miR-190 is downregulated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV2 cells; however, when the miR-190 overexpressed, the expression of proinflammatory mediators, such as iNOS, IL-6, TNF-α, and TGF-β1, were inhibited and the anti-inflammatory mediator such IL-10 was increased. In addition, we predicted the potential target of miR-190 to be Nlrp3 and verified by luciferase reporter assay. The results also showed that Nlrp3 was upregulated in LPS-induced BV2 cells, whereas knockdown of Nlrp3 inhibited the LPS-induced inflammatory response in BV2 cells. Furthermore, upregulation of miR-190 or knockdown of Nlrp3 inhibited LPS-induced apoptosis in BV2 cells. However, the apoptosis inhibition effect of miR-190 was abrogated by overexpression of Nlrp3. Finally, upregulation of miR-190 inhibited the activation of microglial cells and  and attenuated the  hydroxylase loss in SNpc in MPTP-induced PD mice. In conclusion, we demonstrated that miR-190 alleviates neuronal damage and inhibits  via negatively regulating the expression and activation of Nlrp3 in MPTP-induced PD mouse model.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31273200>Metabolomic signature of exposure and response to citalopram/escitalopram in depressed outpatients.</a></h2><p>Metabolomics provides valuable tools for the study of drug effects, unraveling the mechanism of action and variation in response due to treatment. In this study we used electrochemistry-based targeted metabolomics to gain insights into the mechanisms of action of escitalopram/citalopram focusing on a set of 31 metabolites from neurotransmitter-related pathways. Overall, 290 unipolar patients with major depressive disorder were profiled at baseline, after 4 and 8 weeks of drug treatment. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRSD) scores gauged depressive symptom severity. More significant metabolic changes were found after 8 weeks than 4 weeks post baseline. Within the tryptophan pathway, we noted significant reductions in serotonin (5HT) and increases in indoles that are known to be influenced by human gut microbial cometabolism. 5HT, 5-hydroxyindoleacetate (5HIAA), and the ratio of 5HIAA/5HT showed significant correlations to temporal changes in HRSD scores. In the  pathway, changes were observed in the end products of the catecholamines, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol and vinylmandelic acid. Furthermore, two phenolic acids, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, produced through noncanconical pathways, were increased with drug exposure. In the purine pathway, significant reductions in hypoxanthine and xanthine levels were observed. Examination of metabolite interactions through differential partial correlation networks revealed changes in guanosine-homogentisic acid and methionine- interactions associated with HRSD. Genetic association studies using the ratios of these interacting pairs of metabolites highlighted two genetic loci harboring genes previously linked to depression, neurotransmission, or neurodegeneration. Overall, exposure to escitalopram/citalopram results in shifts in metabolism through noncanonical pathways, which suggest possible roles for the gut microbiome, oxidative stress, and -related mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069753>Pifithrin-Alpha Reduces Methamphetamine Neurotoxicity in Cultured Dopaminergic Neurons.</a></h2><p>Methamphetamine (Meth) is a widely abused stimulant. High-dose Meth induces degeneration of dopaminergic neurons through p53-mediated apoptosis. A recent study indicated that treatment with the p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-alpha (PFT-α), antagonized Meth-mediated behavioral deficits in mice. The mechanisms underpinning the protective action of PFT-α against Meth have not been identified, and hence, their investigation is the focus of this study. Primary dopaminergic neuronal cultures were prepared from rat embryonic ventral mesencephalic tissue. High-dose Meth challenge reduced  hydroxylase immunoreactivity and increased terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dNTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) labeling. PFT-α significantly antagonized these responses. PFT-α also reduced Meth-activated translocation of p53 to the nucleus, an initial step before transcription. Previous studies have indicated that p53 can also activate cell death through transcription-independent pathways. We found that PFT-α attenuated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressor thapsigargin (Tg)-mediated loss of dopaminergic neurons. ER stress was further monitored through the release of Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) from SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing GLuc-based Secreted ER Calcium-Modulated Protein (GLuc-SERCaMP). Meth or Tg significantly increased GLuc release in to the media, with PFT-α significantly reducing GLuc release. Additionally, PFT-α significantly attenuated Meth-induced CHOP expression. In conclusion, our data indicate that PFT-α is neuroprotective against Meth-mediated neurodegeneration via transcription-dependent nuclear and -independent cytosolic ER stress pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443172>Pathogenic and Therapeutic Relevance of JAK/STAT Signaling in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Integration of Distinct Inflammatory Pathways and the Prospect of Their Inhibition with an Oral Agent.</a></h2><p>Four Janus kinases (JAKs) (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2) and seven signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) (STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A, STAT5B, STAT6) mediate the signal transduction of more than 50 cytokines and growth factors in many different cell types. Located intracellularly and downstream of cytokine receptors, JAKs integrate and balance the actions of various signaling pathways. With distinct panels of STAT-sensitive genes in different tissues, this highly heterogeneous system has broad in vivo functions playing a crucial role in the immune system. Thus, the JAK/STAT pathway is critical for resisting infection, maintaining immune tolerance, and enforcing barrier functions and immune surveillance against cancer. Breakdowns of this system and/or increased signal transduction may lead to autoimmunity and other diseases. Accordingly, the recent development and approval of the first small synthetic molecules targeting JAK molecules have opened new therapeutic avenues of potentially broad therapeutic relevance. Extensive data are now available regarding the JAK/STAT pathway in rheumatoid arthritis. Dysregulation of the cytokines is also a hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and targeting the JAK/STAT proteins allows simultaneous suppression of multiple cytokines. Evidence from in vitro studies and animal models supports a pivotal role also in the pathogenesis of cutaneous lupus and SLE. This has important therapeutic implications, given the current paucity of targeted therapies especially in the latter. Herein, we summarize the currently available literature in experimental SLE, which has led to the recent promising Phase II clinical trial of a JAK inhibitor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31444972>Serum levels of -related markers and metabolites predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with and without bevacizumab in breast cancers.</a></h2><p>Angiogenesis is necessary for tumor growth and has been targeted in breast cancer; however, it is unclear which patients will respond and benefit from antiangiogenic therapy. We report noninvasive monitoring of patient response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy given alone or in combination with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (bevacizumab) in a randomized clinical trial. At four time points during neoadjuvant chemotherapy ± bevacizumab of receptor -protein kinase erbB-2-negative breast cancers, we measured metabolites and -related markers in patient's serum. We report significant changes in the levels of several molecules induced by bevacizumab, the most prominent being an increase in pentraxin 3 (PTX3) and von Willebrand factor (VWF). Serum levels of AXL, VWF and pulmonary and activation-regulated cytokine (PARC/CCL18) reflected response to chemotherapy alone or in combination with bevacizumab. We further analyzed serum cytokines in relation to tumor characteristics such as gene expression, tumor metabolites and tumor infiltrating leukocytes. We found that VWF and growth-differentiation factor 15 tumor mRNA levels correlated with their respective serum protein levels suggesting that these cytokines may be produced by tumors and outflow to the bloodstream while influencing the tumor microenvironment locally. Finally, we used binomial logistic regression which allowed to predict patient's response using only 10 noninvasive biomarkers. Our study highlights the potential of monitoring circulating levels of cytokines and metabolites during breast cancer therapy.© 2019 The Authors.

To date, no clinical therapy is available to reverse the inﬂammatory damage or pancreatic fibrosis associated with CP. This study systematically investigated the effect of Dasatinib, a multiple  kinases (TKs) inhibitor, on pancreatic fibrosis and  in vivo and in vitro. We found that Dasatinib notably ameliorated pancreatic fibrosis and infiltration of macrophages in a model of caerulein-induced murine CP. Further RNA-seq and phosphoproteomic analysis and in vitro validation assays indicated that Dasatinib exerted a marked inhibition on the proliferation and activation of PSCs, which may be resulted from increased GSK3β-mediated β-catenin cytosol retention by inhibiting upstream multiple TKs (such as PDGFR and Src) and MAPK cascades (including ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK). In addition, Dasatinib significantly restrained both the M1 and M2 polarization of macrophages, and impeded its recruitment and crosstalk with PSCs. Our findings indicated that Dasatinib is a potential anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic therapeutic strategy for CP.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Angs play physiological and pathological roles through the Tie  kinase receptors. The Ang-Tie signaling pathway participates in the developmental and tumor-induced angiogenesis and is also involved in many disease settings, such as vascular diseases, systemic , and cancers. Since Angs are widely expressed in the kidney, an enormous amount of research focuses on their roles in the kidney. In this review, we describe the biological functions of the Ang-Tie signaling pathway and summarize their roles in kidney development and maturation, acute and chronic kidney diseases, diabetic nephropathy, lupus nephropathy, hemolytic uremic syndrome, end-stage renal diseases, and renal cell carcinoma.

Alternatively, targeting K-RAS-downstream effectors, K-RAS-cooperating signaling pathways or cancer hallmarks, such as tumor-promoting , has been shown to be a promising therapeutic strategy. Since the JAK-STAT pathway is considered to be a central player in -mediated tumorigenesis, we investigated here the implication of JAK-STAT signaling and the therapeutic potential of JAK1/2 inhibition in K-RAS-driven lung AC. Our data showed that JAK1 and JAK2 are activated in human lung AC and that increased activation of JAK-STAT signaling correlated with disease progression and K-RAS activity in human lung AC. Accordingly, administration of the JAK1/2 selective  kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib reduced proliferation of tumor cells and effectively reduced tumor progression in immunodeficient and immunocompetent mouse models of K-RAS-driven lung AC. Notably, JAK1/2 inhibition led to the establishment of an antitumorigenic tumor microenvironment, characterized by decreased levels of tumor-promoting chemokines and cytokines and reduced numbers of infiltrating myeloid derived suppressor cells, thereby impairing tumor growth. Taken together, we identified JAK1/2 inhibition as promising therapy for K-RAS-driven lung AC.© 2019 The Authors.

The myocardial ischemia (MI) model was established by ligation of the left anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery. EA (2 Hz/15 Hz，1.5－2 mA) was applied to bilateral "Neiguan" (PC6) for 30 min, once daily for 4 days. The myocardial infarct size was detected by 2, 3, 5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, myocardial histopathological changes and inflammatory infiltration were assessed by H．E. staining, and the expression of IL-8, IL-10, TH, β3AR, and eNOS in the myocardium was determined by using Western blot.Compared with the sham group, a marked myocardial infarction was found in the left ventricle tissue, accompanied with disordered arrangement of myocardial fibers and higher degree of inflammatory cell infiltration, and increased expression of IL-8, TH, β3AR and eNOS in the myocardium in the model group (<0.01), but without significant change in the expression of IL-10 (>0.05).

Longer exposure produced fasting hyperglycemia but with no increase in weight, in contrast to the HFD. Glucose intolerance was attributable to carrageenan-induced  and to increased expression of GRB10. Both HFD and carrageenan increased p(Ser32)-IB and p(Ser307)-IRS1, and the increases were greater following the combined exposure. The effects of carrageenan were inhibited by the combination of the free radical inhibitor Tempol and BCL10 siRNA, which had no impact on the HFD-mediated increase. In contrast, the PKC inhibitor sotrastaurin blocked the HFD-induced increases, without an effect on the carrageenan-mediated effects. HFD had no impact on the expression of GRB10. Both carrageenan and high fat increased hepatic infiltration by F4/80-positive macrophages. Serum galectin-3 and galectin-3 binding to the insulin receptor increased by carrageenan and by HFD.  phosphorylation of the insulin receptor declined following either exposure and was further reduced by their combination. Carrageenan reduced the activity of the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (ARSB; arylsulfatase B), which was unchanged following HFD.

Both human and mouse CD8 T cells are thought to be negative for TAM receptor expression. In this study, we show that T-cell receptor (TCR)-activated human primary CD8 T cells expressed MERTK and the ligand PROS1 from day 2 postactivation. PROS1-mediated MERTK signaling served as a late costimulatory signal, increasing proliferation and secretion of effector and memory-associated cytokines. Knockdown and inhibition studies confirmed that this costimulatory effect was mediated through MERTK. Transcriptomic and metabolic analyses of PROS1-blocked CD8 T cells demonstrated a role of the PROS1-MERTK axis in differentiation of memory CD8 T cells. Finally, using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from melanoma patients, we show that MERTK signaling on T cells improved TIL expansion and TIL-mediated autologous cancer cell killing. We conclude that MERTK serves as a late costimulatory signal for CD8 T cells. Identification of this costimulatory function of MERTK on human CD8 T cells suggests caution in the development of MERTK inhibitors for hematologic or solid cancer treatment.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31072166>An emerging role of interleukin-23 in rheumatoid arthritis.</a></h2><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune, chronic inflammatory disease and is characterized by destruction of the articular cartilage. A number of pro-inflammatory cytokines work sequentially and in concert with one another to induce the development of RA. IL-23, a member of IL-12 family, is composed of p19 and p40 subunits and it interacts with IL-23 receptor complex to trigger plethora of biochemical actions. A number of preclinical studies have shown the role of IL-23 in the development of RA in rodents. IL-23 receptor signaling is primarily linked to the activation of JAK-STAT,  kinase 2, NF-kB, and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors. IL-23 produces its osteoclastogenic effects, mainly through IL-17 and Th17 cells suggesting the importance of IL-23/IL-17/Th17 in the joint  and destruction in RA. Monoclonal antibodies targeted against IL-23, including tildrakizumab and guselkumab have been developed and evaluated in clinical trials.

A variant in protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) is associated with reduced risk of developing IBD, but promotes the onset of autoimmune disorders. While the role of PTPN22 in modulating molecular pathways involved in IBD pathogenesis is well studied, its impact on shaping the intestinal microbiota has not been addressed in depth. Here, we demonstrate that mice carrying the PTPN22 variant (619W mice) were protected from acute dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis, but suffered from pronounced  upon chronic DSS treatment. The basal microbiota composition was distinct between genotypes, and DSS-induced dysbiosis was milder in 619W mice than in WT littermates. Transfer of microbiota from 619W mice after the first DSS cycle into treatment-naive 619W mice promoted colitis, indicating that changes in microbial composition enhanced chronic colitis in those animals.

The potent oxidizing and nitrating agent peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH) is formed at sites of , and data implicate ONOOH in ECM damage and cardiovascular disease. Co-localization of 3-nitrotyrosine, a product of ONOOH-mediated  (Tyr) modification, and laminin has been reported in human atherosclerotic lesions. The sites and consequences of 3-nitrotyrosine (and related nitrated tryptophan) formation on laminin, it's self-assembly and cell interactions are poorly understood. In this study murine laminin-111 was exposed to ONOOH (1-500-fold molar excess). Nitration sites were mapped and quantified using LC-MS/MS. Mono-nitration was detected at 148 sites (126 Tyr, 22 Trp), and di-nitration at 14 sites. Label-free quantification showed enhanced nitration with increasing oxidant doses. Tyr nitration was ∼10-fold greater than at Trp. CO modulated damage in a site-specific manner, with most sites less extensively nitrated. 119 mono-nitration sites were identified with CO present, and no unique sites were detected. 23 di-nitration sites were detected, with 15 unique to the presence of CO. Extensive modification was detected at sites involved in cell adhesion, protein-protein interactions and self-polymerization. Tyr-145 on the γ1 chain was extensively nitrated, and endothelial cells exhibited decreased adhesion to a nitrated peptide modelling this site. Modification of residues involved in self-polymerization interfered with the formation of ordered polymers as detected by scanning electron microscopy. These laminin modifications may contribute to endothelial cell dysfunction and modulate ECM structure and assembly, and thereby contribute to atherogenesis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Here, we developed a novel marker, lactate dehydrogenase (tumor burden marker) to lymphocytes ( marker) ratio (LLR), aimed to reveal the prognostic role of LLR for mRCC patients treated with TKIs. We collected clinical data of mRCC patients treated with TKIs. Receiver operating curve analysis was used to determine the optimal cut-off value.

The lack of characterization of the pathogenesis of psoriasis has hindered efficient clinical treatment of the disease. In our study, we observed that expression of complement component 5a receptor 1(C5aR1) was significantly increased in skin lesions of both imiquimod (IMQ) and IL23-induced psoriatic mice and patients with psoriasis. C5aR1 deficiency or treatment with C5a receptor 1 antagonist (C5aR1a) in mice significantly attenuated psoriasis-like skin lesions and expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Moreover, C5aR1 deficiency significantly decreased IMQ-induced infiltration of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), monocytes and neutrophils in psoriatic skin lesions and functions of pDCs, evidenced by the remarkable reduction in the IMQ-induced production of interferon-α (IFN-α) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and FMS-like  kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L)-dependent pDCs differentiation. Accordingly,  treatment with recombinant C5a accelerated pDCs migration and the differentiation of bone marrow cells into pDCs. Furthermore, biopsies of psoriatic patients showed a dramatic increase of C5aR1 pDCs infiltration in psoriatic skin lesions, compared to healthy subjects. Our results provide direct evidence that C5a/C5aR1 signaling plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.

Because activation of the innate cellular immune response, mediated by microglia, has been linked to the neurodegeneration in PD, in the present study, we evaluated the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) on microglia's morphology, reflective of their activity, as well as  hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in SNpc and motor behavior. Adult male Wistar rats were stereotactically injected with LPS or 6-OHDA into the left dorsolateral striatum. Control groups received appropriate vehicle. The morphological changes of microglial cells and neurotoxic effects were examined at 1, 7, and 14 post-injection days. Both LPS and 6-OHDA caused activation and morphological changes in microglial cells as well as loss of dopaminergic neurons in SNpc. These effects were maximal at 14 days post-injection where motor impairments were also evident. However, our findings indicate that 6-OHDA causes a low degree of microglia activation compared to LPS. Hence, it may be concluded that LPS model of PD might be a better representation of inflammatory involvement in this devastating disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160588>Extracellular vesicles from CLEC2-activated platelets enhance dengue virus-induced lethality via CLEC5A/TLR2.</a></h2><p>Platelet-leukocyte interactions amplify inflammatory reactions, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. CLEC5A and CLEC2 are spleen  kinase (Syk)-coupled C-type lectin receptors, abundantly expressed by leukocytes and platelets, respectively. Whereas CLEC5A is a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) to flaviviruses and bacteria, CLEC2 is the receptor for platelet-activating snake venom aggretin. Here we show that dengue virus (DV) activates platelets via CLEC2 to release extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes (EXOs) and microvesicles (MVs). DV-induced EXOs (DV-EXOs) and MVs (DV-MVs) further activate CLEC5A and TLR2 on neutrophils and macrophages, thereby induce neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and proinflammatory cytokine release. Compared to  stat1 mice, simultaneous blockade of CLEC5A and TLR2 effectively attenuates DV-induced inflammatory response and increases survival rate from 30 to 90%.

The aims of this work were firstly to study the methionine cycle as well as the trans-sulfuration pathway using metabolomic and proteomic approaches identifying the causes of this dysregulation in an experimental model of acute pancreatitis; and secondly to reveal the effects of S-adenosylmethionine administration on these pathways. Acute pancreatitis was induced by cerulein in mice, and a group of animals received S-adenosylmethionine treatment. Cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis rapidly caused marked depletion of methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, 5'-methylthioadenosine, cystathionine, cysteine, and glutathione levels in pancreas, but S-adenosylhomocysteine and homocysteine remained unchanged. Protein steady-state levels of S-adenosylhomocysteine-hydrolase and cystathionine gamma-lyase diminished but methylthioadenosine phosphorylase levels increased in pancreas with acute pancreatitis. Although cystathionine β-synthase protein levels did not change with acute pancreatitis, Nos2 mRNA and protein levels were markedly up-regulated and caused  nitration of cystathionine β-synthase in pancreas. S-adenosylmethionine administration enhanced Nos2 mRNA expression and cystathionine β-synthase nitration and triggered homocysteine accumulation in acute pancreatitis. Furthermore, S-adenosylmethionine administration promoted enrichment of the euchromatin marker H3K4me3 in the promoters of Tnf-α, Il-6, and Nos2 and enhanced the mRNA up-regulation of these genes. Accordingly, S-adenosylmethionine administration increased inflammatory infiltrate and edema in pancreas with acute pancreatitis. In conclusion, -nitration of cystathionine β-synthase blockades the trans-sulfuration pathway in acute pancreatitis promoting homocysteine accumulation upon S-adenosylmethionine treatment.Copyright © 2019.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is an autoinflammatory bone disorder that presents with bone pain and localized swelling.  mice, isolated from a mutagenesis screen, exhibit a spontaneous inflammatory paw phenotype that includes sterile osteomyelitis and systemic reduced bone mineral density. To elucidate the molecular basis of the disease, positional cloning of the causative gene for  was attempted. Using a candidate gene approach, a missense mutation in the C-terminal region of , a member of Src family  kinases (SFKs), was identified. For functional confirmation, additional mutations at the N terminus of  were introduced in  mice by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. N-terminal deleterious mutations of  abolished the inflammatory phenotype in  mice, but in-frame and missense mutations in the same region continue to exhibit the phenotype. The fact that  null mutant mice are morphologically normal suggests that the  in this model depends on Fgr products. Furthermore, the levels of C-terminal negative regulatory phosphorylation of Fgr  are distinctly reduced compared with that of wild-type Fgr. In addition, whole-exome sequencing of 99 CRMO patients including 88 trios (proband and parents) identified 13 patients with heterozygous coding sequence variants in , including two missense mutant proteins that affect kinase activity. Our results strongly indicate that gain-of-function mutations in  are involved in sterile osteomyelitis, and thus targeting SFKs using specific inhibitors may allow for efficient treatment of the disease.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Flt-1 (FMS-like  kinase receptor 1) is the most promising placenta-derived predictive biomarker for preeclampsia. We aimed to classify placental dysfunction in preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction at delivery by metabolic profiling and authenticate the biomarker Flt-1 for placental dysfunction. We studied 143 pregnancies with or without preeclampsia and/or fetal growth restriction delivered by cesarean section. Metabolic placenta profiles were created by high-resolution magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and the resulting placental phenotypes obtained by hierarchical clustering. Placental Flt-1 expression (membrane-bound and soluble isoforms combined) and maternal serum Flt-1 expression (soluble isoforms) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and ELISA, respectively. We identified 3 distinct placenta groups by 21 metabolites and diagnostic outcome parameters; normal placentas, moderate placental dysfunction, and severe placental dysfunction. Increased placental Flt-1 was associated with severe placental dysfunction, and increased serum Flt-1 was associated with moderate and severe placental dysfunction. The preeclamptic pregnancies with and without placental dysfunction could be distinguished by 5 metabolites and placental Flt-1. Placental Flt-1 alone could separate normal pregnancies with and without placental dysfunction. In conclusion, metabolomics could classify placental dysfunction and provide information not identified by traditional diagnostics and metabolites with biomarker potential were identified. Flt-1 was confirmed as precision biomarker for placental dysfunction, substantiating its usefulness for identification of high-risk pregnancies for preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction with placental involvement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31396305>T Cell-Derived IL-17A Induces Vascular Dysfunction via Perivascular Fibrosis Formation and Dysregulation of NO/cGMP Signaling.</a></h2><p>The neutrophil recruiting cytokine Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is a key component in vascular dysfunction and arterial hypertension. Moreover, IL-17A has a central role for the vascular infiltration of myeloid cells into the arterial wall in Angiotensin II-induced vascular . The intention of our study was to analyze the impact of T cell-derived IL-17A on hypertension, vascular function, and .Chronic IL-17A overexpression in T cells (CD4-IL-17A mice) resulted in elevated reactive oxygen species in the peripheral blood and a significant vascular dysfunction compared to control mice. The vascular dysfunction seen in the CD4-IL-17A mice was only accompanied by a modest and nonsignificant accumulation of inflammatory cells within the vessel wall. Therefore, infiltrating myeloid cells did not serve as an explanation of the vascular dysfunction seen in a chronic IL-17A-driven mouse model. In addition to vascular dysfunction, CD4-IL-17A mice displayed vascular fibrosis with highly proliferative fibroblasts. This fibroblast proliferation was induced by exposure to IL-17A as confirmed by  experiments with primary murine fibroblastic cells. We also found that the NO/cGMP pathway was downregulated in the vasculature of the CD4-IL-17A mice, while levels of protein  kinase 2 (PYK2), an oxidative stress-triggered process associated with T cell activation, were upregulated in the perivascular fat tissue (PVAT).Our data demonstrate that T cell-derived IL-17A elicits vascular dysfunction by mediating proliferation of fibroblasts and subsequent vascular fibrosis associated with PYK2 upregulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31248337>Cardiac tamponade and graft versus host disease: one more reason to remember.</a></h2><p>In patients with cutaneous graft versus host disease (GvHD) that is resistant to traditional steroid therapy, imatinib is a first-generation  kinase inhibitor that seems to be a viable option.

Mixed granulocytic asthma is a cause of concern as corticosteroids often fail to control this phenotype. Different kinases such as Brutons's  kinase (BTK) and IL-2 inducible T cell kinase (ITK) play a pivotal role in shaping allergic airway . Ibrutinib is primarily a BTK inhibitor, however it is reported to be an ITK inhibitor as well. In this study, we sought to determine the effect of Ibrutinib on Th1, Th17 and Th2 immune responses in a cockroach allergen extract (CE)-induced mixed granulocytic (eosinophilic and neutrophilic) mouse model in preventative mode. Ibrutinib attenuated neutrophilic  at a much lower doses (25-75 μg/mouse) in CE-induced mixed granulocytic asthma whereas Th2/Th17 immune responses remained unaffected at these doses. However, at a much higher dose, i.e. 250 μg/mouse, Ibrutinib remarkably suppressed both Th17/Th2 and lymphocytic/neutrophilic/eosinophilic airway . At molecular level, Ibrutinib suppressed phosphorylation of BTK in neutrophils at lower doses and ITK in CD4 + T cells at higher doses in CE-treated mice. Further, effects of Ibrutinib were compared with dexamethasone on CE-induced mixed granulocytic asthma in therapeutic mode. Ibrutinib was able to control granulocytic  along with Th2/Th17 immune response in therapeutic mode whereas dexamethasone limited only Th2/eosinophilic . Thus, Ibrutinib has the potential to suppress both Th17/Th2 and neutrophilic/eosinophilic  during mixed granulocytic asthma and therefore may be pursued as alternative therapeutic option in difficult-to-treat asthma which is resistant to corticosteroids.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Chemotherapeutic agents are used in the treatment of cancer, but in most cases, patients develop resistance. Phenformin, an oral biguanide drug used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, was removed from the market due to a high risk of fatal lactic acidosis. However, it has been shown that phenformin is, with other biguanides, an authentic tumor disruptor, not only by the production of hypoglycemia due to caloric restriction through AMP-activated protein kinase with energy detection (AMPK) but also as a blocker of the mTOR regulatory complex. Moreover, the addition of phenformin eliminates resistance to antiangiogenic  kinase inhibitors (TKI), which prevent the uncontrolled metabolism of glucose in tumor cells. In this review, we evidence the great potential of phenformin as an anticancer agent.

Premalignant acinar cell reprogramming (acinar-to-ductal metaplasia [ADM]) is a precursor of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions that can progress to PDAC. This study investigated the role of proline-rich  kinase 2 (PYK2) in mutant Kras-induced and pancreatitis-associated ADM and PanIN formation, as well as in PDAC maintenance.Genetically engineered mouse models of mutant Kras (glycine 12 to aspartic acid) and Pyk2 deletion were used for investigating the role of PYK2 in PDAC genesis in mice. In vitro ADM assays were conducted using primary pancreatic acinar cells isolated from mice. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and a series of biochemical experiments were used to investigate upstream regulators/downstream targets of PYK2 in pancreatic carcinogenesis. PDAC cell line xenograft experiments were performed to study the role of PYK2 and its downstream target in PDAC maintenance.PYK2 was increased substantially in ADM lesions induced by mutant Kras or inflammatory injury. Pyk2 deletion remarkably suppressed ADM and PanIN formation in a mutant Kras-driven and pancreatitis-associated PDAC model, whereas PYK2 knockdown substantially inhibited PDAC cell growth in vitro and in nude mice. This study uncovered a novel yes-associated protein 1/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/PYK2/β-catenin regulation axis in PDAC. Our results suggest that PYK2 contributes to PDAC genesis and maintenance by activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway through directly phosphorylating β-catenin.The current study uncovers PYK2 as a novel downstream effector of mutant KRAS signaling, a previously unrecognized mediator of pancreatitis-induced ADM and a novel intervention target for PDAC.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, however, continue to be a major problem in infected patients. The neuropathology underlying HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders has not been well characterized, and evidence suggests different contributing mechanisms. One potential mechanism is the induction of oxidative stress. Using the HIV-1 transgenic (Tg) rat model of HIV, we found increased striatal NADPH oxidase-4 and neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression in the adult (7- to 9-month-old) Tg rat compared with control rats but not in the young (1-month-old) Tg rats. This was accompanied by increased 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) immunostaining in the adult Tg rats, which worsened significantly in the old Tg rats (18 to 20 months old). There was, however, no concurrent induction of the antioxidant systems because there was no change in the expression of the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 and its downstream targets (thioredoxin and glutathione antioxidant systems). Colocalization of 3-NT staining with neurofilament proteins and evidence of decreased  hydroxylase and dopamine transporter expression in the old rats support dopaminergic involvement. We conclude that the HIV-1 Tg rat brain shows evidence of nitrosative stress without appropriate oxidation-reduction adaptation, whereas 3-NT modification of striatal neurofilament proteins likely points to the ensuing dopaminergic neuronal loss and dysfunction in the aging HIV-1 Tg rat.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

AXL, a  kinase receptor, is commonly overexpressed in several solid tumours and numerous hematopoietic malignancies including acute myeloid leukaemia, acute lymphocytic leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and multiple myeloma. AXL significantly promotes tumour cell migration, invasion and metastasis, as well as angiogenesis. AXL also plays an important role in  and macrophage ontogeny. Recent studies have revealed that AXL contributes to leukaemic phenotypes through activation of oncogenic signalling pathways that lead to increased cell migration and proliferation. To evaluate the mechanisms underlying the role of AXL signalling in tumour metastasis, we screened a phage display library to generate a novel human monoclonal antibody, named DAXL-88, that recognizes both human and murine AXL. The concentrations of DAXL-88 required for 50% maximal binding to human and murine AXL were 0.118 and 0.164 μg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, DAXL-88 bound to human AXL with high affinity (K  ~ 370 pM). DAXL-88 blocked the interaction between AXL and its ligand, growth arrest-specific gene 6 (GAS6), with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 2.16 μg/mL. Moreover, DAXL-88 inhibited AXL/GAS6-dependent cell signalling, which is implicated in cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, the novel anti-AXL DAXL-88 high-affinity antibody blocks the interaction between AXL and GAS6 and inhibits tumour cell migration and invasion induced by GAS6. Thus, DAXL-88 offers promise for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies in solid tumours, leukaemias and other lymphoid neoplasms.© 2019 The Authors.

Their role in cancer is largely context-dependent as they can both act as oncogenes and tumor suppressors. We review here the role of STAT3/5 activation in solid cancers and summarize their association with survival in cancer patients. The molecular mechanisms that underpin the oncogenic activity of STAT3/5 signaling include the regulation of genes that control cell cycle and cell death. However, recent advances also highlight the critical role of STAT3/5 target genes mediating  and stemness. In addition, STAT3 mitochondrial functions are required for transformation. On the other hand, several tumor suppressor pathways act on or are activated by STAT3/5 signaling, including  phosphatases, the sumo ligase Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT3 (PIAS3), the E3 ubiquitin ligase TATA Element Modulatory Factor/Androgen Receptor-Coactivator of 160 kDa (TMF/ARA160), the miRNAs miR-124 and miR-1181, the Protein of alternative reading frame 19 (p19ARF)/p53 pathway and the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 and 3 (SOCS1/3) proteins.

The diversity in functions controlled by the various catalytic isoforms (p110α, p110β, p110δ, and p110γ) depends on their abilities to be activated by distinct stimuli such as receptor  kinases (RTKs), G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and the Ras family of small G-proteins. A major factor determining the ability of each p110 enzyme to be activated is the presence of regulatory binding partners. Given the overwhelming evidence for the involvement of PI3Ks in diseases such as cancer, , immunodeficiency and diabetes, an understanding of how these regulatory proteins influence PI3K function is essential.

However, its role in acute aortic dissection (AD) is not known yet. Using an aortic dissection model in SR-A1-deficient mice and their wild type littermates, we found that SR-A1 deficiency aggravated beta-aminopropionitrile monofumarate induced thoracic aortic dilation, false lumen formation, extracellular matrix degradation, vascular  and accumulation of apoptotic cells. These pathological changes were associated with an impaired macrophage efferocytosis mediated by -protein kinase receptor Tyro3 in vitro and in vivo. SR-A1 could directly interact with Tyro3 and was required for Tyro3 phosphorylation to activate its downstream PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Importantly, co-culture of SR-A1 macrophages with apoptotic Jurkat cells resulted in less devoured apoptotic cells accompanied by swelling mitochondria and damaged ATP generation, following poor IL-10 and robust TNF-α production. Deficiency of SR-A1 did not influence phagolysosome formation during the efferocytosis. Lentiviral overexpression of Tyro3 in SR-A1 macrophages induced restorative phagocytosis in vitro.

However, the impacts of serum electrolytes on ROS-associated damage has received little attention. We demonstrate that the conversion of OH to carbonate and halogen radicals via reactions with serum-relevant carbonate and halide concentrations fundamentally alters the targeting of amino acids and loss of enzymatic activity in catalase, albumin and carbonic anhydrase, three important blood proteins. Chemical kinetic modeling indicated that carbonate and halogen radical concentrations should exceed OH concentrations by 6 and 2 orders of magnitude, respectively. Steady-state γ-radiolysis experiments demonstrated that serum-level carbonates and halides increased , tryptophan and enzymatic activity losses in catalase up to 6-fold. These outcomes were specific to carbonates and halides, not general ionic strength effects. Serum carbonates and halides increased the degradation of tyrosines and methionines in albumin, and increased the degradation of histidines while decreasing enzymatic activity loss in carbonic anhydrase. Serum electrolytes increased the degradation of tyrosines, tryptophans and enzymatic activity in the model enzyme, ketosteroid isomerase, predominantly due to carbonate radical reactions. Treatment of a mutant ketosteroid isomerase indicated that preferential targeting of the active site  accounted for half of the total  loss. The results suggest that carbonate and halogen radicals may be more significant than OH as drivers for protein degradation in serum. Accounting for the selective targeting of biomolecules by these daughter radicals is important for developing a mechanistic understanding of the consequences of oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Spleen  kinase (Syk) inhibitors are regarded as an effective alternative to existing drugs for the treatment of this disease. However, studies evaluating fostamatinib, a new Syk inhibitor, are either invalid or insufficient. Through a systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of fostamatinib at different dosages in rheumatoid arthritis patients that display an inadequate response to methotrexate or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.  Randomized controlled trials published between January 2000 and November 2018 were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library.

These studies compared different dosages of fostamatinib to placebo, including the intake of 100 mg fostamatinib twice per day (bid) for 4 weeks followed by 150 mg once per day (qd) vs. the intake of 100 mg bid.  Two investigators analyzed 11 randomized placebo-controlled trials consisting of 3,680 patients.

Growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6) has high affinity for Axl receptor. The role of Gas6/Axl signaling in ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute lung injury (IR-ALI) has not been explored previously. We hypothesized that Gas6/Axl signaling regulates IR-induced alveolar  via a pathway mediated by suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3).IR-ALI was induced by producing 30 min of ischemia followed by 90 min of reperfusion in situ in an isolated and perfused rat lung model. The rats were randomly allotted to a control group and IR groups, which were treated with three different doses of Gas6. Mouse alveolar epithelium MLE-12 cells were cultured in control and hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) conditions with or without Gas6 and Axl inhibitor R428 pretreatment.We found that Gas6 attenuated IR-induced lung edema, the production of proinflammatory cytokines in perfusates, and the severity of ALI ex vivo. IR down-regulated SOCS3 expression and up-regulated NF-κB, and Gas6 restored this process. In the model of MLE-12 cells with HR, Gas6 suppressed the activation of TRAF6 and NF-κB by up-regulating SOCS3. Axl expression of alveolar epithelium was suppressed in IR-ALI but Gas6 restored phosphorylation of Axl. The anti-inflammatory effect of Gas6 was antagonized by R428, which highlighted that phosphorylation of Axl mediated the protective role of Gas6 in IR-ALI.Gas6 up-regulates phosphorylation of Axl on alveolar epithelium in IR-ALI.

The present study investigated the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of the DHA-containing PlsEtn precursor, PPI-1011, in the intestine of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice. Treatment with PPI-1011 prevented the MPTP-induced decrease in PlsEtn levels. In addition it prevented the loss of  hydroxylase (TH) expression and reduced the infiltration of macrophages in the myenteric plexus of MPTP-treated mice. The protective effects of PPI-1011 were observed regardless of whether it was administered pre- or post- MPTP treatment. These results suggest that PPI-1011 has neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties in the gut and indicate its potential utility as a treatment for both early and more advanced stages of PD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

At the onset of , sympathetic activity is increased in the affected tissue. However, sympathetic fibers are largely absent from chronically inflamed tissue. Apparently, there is a very dynamic relationship between sympathetic innervation and the immune system in areas of , and hence a rapid and easy method for quantification of nerve fiber density of target organs is of great value to answer potential research questions. Currently, nervous fiber densities are either determined by tedious manual counting, which is not suitable for high throughput approaches, or by expensive automated processes relying on specialized software and high-end microscopy equipment. Usually,  hydroxylase (TH) is used as the marker for sympathetic fibers. In order to overcome the current quantification bottleneck with a cost-efficient alternative, an automated process was established and compared to the classic manual approach of counting TH-positive sympathetic fibers. Since TH is not exclusively expressed on sympathetic fibers, but also in a number of catecholamine-producing cells, a prerequisite for automated determination of fiber densities is to reliably distinct between cells and fibers. Therefore, an additional staining using peripherin exclusively expressed in nervous fibers as a secondary marker was established. Using this novel approach, we studied the spleens from a syndecan-3 knockout (SDC3KO) mouse line, and demonstrated equal results on SNS fiber density for both manual and automated counts (Manual counts: wildtype: 22.57 +/- 11.72 fibers per mm2; ko: 31.95 +/- 18.85 fibers per mm2; p = 0.05; Automated counts: wildtype: 31.6 +/- 18.98 fibers per mm2; ko: 45.49 +/- 19.65 fibers per mm2; p = 0.02). In conclusion, this new and simple method can be used as a high-throughput approach to reliably and quickly estimate SNS nerve fiber density in target tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634391>All-trans Retinoic Acid Counteracts Diarrhea and Inhibition of Downregulated in Adenoma Expression in Gut .</a></h2><p>Intestinal epithelial apical membrane Cl-/HCO3- exchanger DRA (downregulated in adenoma, SLC26A3) has emerged as an important therapeutic target for diarrhea, emphasizing the potential therapeutic role of agents that upregulate DRA. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a key vitamin A metabolite, was earlier shown by us to stimulate DRA expression in intestinal epithelial cells. However, its role in modulating DRA in gut  has not been investigated.Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of ATRA in counteracting -induced decrease in DRA in vitro and in vivo.Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-treated Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated C57BL/6J mice served as in vitro and in vivo models of gut , respectively. The effect of ATRA on IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of DRA function, expression, and promoter activity were elucidated. In the DSS colitis model, diarrheal phenotype, cytokine response, in vivo imaging, myeloperoxidase activity, and DRA expression were measured in the distal colon.All-trans retinoic acid (10 μM, 24 h) abrogated IFN-γ (30 ng/mL, 24 h)-induced decrease in DRA function, expression, and promoter activity in Caco-2 cells. All-trans retinoic acid altered IFN-γ signaling via blocking IFN-γ-induced  phosphorylation of STAT-1. All-trans retinoic acid cotreatment (1 mg/kg BW, i.p. daily) of DSS-treated mice (3% in drinking water for 7 days) alleviated colitis-associated weight loss, diarrheal phenotype, and induction of IL-1β and CXCL1 and a decrease in DRA mRNA and protein levels in the colon.Our data showing upregulation of DRA under normal and inflammatory conditions by ATRA demonstrate a novel role of this micronutrient in alleviating IBD-associated diarrhea.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Here we show in a murine model of pemphigus, a prototypic cutaneous autoantibody-mediated disorder, that blood-circulating IgG extravasates into the skin in a time- and dose-dependent manner under homeostatic conditions. This IgG extravasation is unaffected by depletion of Fcγ receptors, but is largely attenuated by specific ablation of dynamin-dependent endocytic vesicle formation in blood endothelial cells (BECs). Among dynamin-dependent endocytic vesicles, IgG co-localizes well with caveolae in cultured BECs. An Abl family  kinase inhibitor imatinib, which reduces caveolae-mediated endocytosis, impairs IgG extravasation in the skin and attenuates the murine pemphigus manifestations. Our study highlights the kinetics of IgG extravasation in vivo, which might be a clue to understand the pathological mechanism of autoantibody-mediated autoimmune disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658061>Bergenin Ameliorates MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease by Activating PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent progressive neurodegenerative disease with motor disorders and cognitive impairment. Bergenin (Berg), extracted from the herb of Saxifrage stolonifera Curt.

The expression levels of  hydroxylase, dopamine, and Iba-1 were examined. The levels of a series of inflammatory mediators were measured by qPCR. In addition, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was investigated to illustrate the underlying mechanism. In vitro, PC12 cells subjected to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were treated with Berg.We found that MPTP injection introduced motor deficits, apoptosis of neurons and , as well as inhibited the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. However, Berg treatment suppressed the MPTP-induced alterations. In vitro, Berg attenuated the cytotoxic effects on PC12 cells induced by the culture supernatants derived from LPS-induced microglial cells.Berg attenuated the PD symptoms via activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31267715>VE-PTP inhibition stabilizes endothelial junctions by activating FGD5.</a></h2><p>Inhibition of VE-PTP, an endothelial receptor-type  phosphatase, triggers phosphorylation of the  kinase receptor Tie-2, which leads to the suppression of -induced vascular permeability. Analyzing the underlying mechanism, we show here that inhibition of VE-PTP and activation of Tie-2 induce  phosphorylation of FGD5, a GTPase exchange factor (GEF) for Cdc42, and stimulate its translocation to cell contacts. Interfering with the expression of FGD5 blocks the junction-stabilizing effect of VE-PTP inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Likewise, FGD5 is required for strengthening cortical actin bundles and inhibiting radial stress fiber formation, which are each stimulated by VE-PTP inhibition. We identify Y820 of FGD5 as the direct substrate for VE-PTP. The phosphorylation of FGD5-Y820 is required for the stabilization of endothelial junctions and for the activation of Cdc42 by VE-PTP inhibition but is dispensable for the recruitment of FGD5 to endothelial cell contacts. Thus, activation of FGD5 is a two-step process that comprises membrane recruitment and phosphorylation of Y820. These steps are necessary for the junction-stabilizing effect stimulated by VE-PTP inhibition and Tie-2 activation.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678415>Total saponins extracted from Abrus cantoniensis Hance suppress hepatitis B virus replication in vitro and in rAAV8-1.3HBV transfected mice.</a></h2><p>Hepatitis B, an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), is still a serious problem affecting global public health. Abrus cantoniensis Hance (AC), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has been used as a folk medicine for treating hepatitis in China from ancient times. However, its active ingredients are still unclear.Our previous study indicated that saponins extracted from AC (ACS) were the active anti-HBV ingredients in AC. This study aimed to further investigate the anti-HBV effect of ACS in vitro and in vivo.HepG2.2.15 cells which consecutively produce HBV DNA and HBV antigens were used for in vitro test, and C57BL/6 mice infected by a recombinant adeno-associated virus 8 vector carrying 1.3 copies of HBV genome (rAAV8-HBV1.3) were used for in vivo test. The histopathological changes and the immune indices were evaluated in mice model. Genechip was conducted to identify genes and pathways regulated by ACS in HepG2.2.15 cells.In this study, we confirmed that ACS treatment prominently inhibited production of HBV DNA, Hepatitis Be Antigen (HBeAg), and Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in HepG2.2.15 cells. ACS treatment also decreased serum HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA level in rAAV8-1.3HBV transfected mice, which is in accordance with the in vitro results. Moreover, HBV infection-induced liver  was significantly relieved by ACS, which could be observed in H&E staining and immunohistochemistry of HBcAg. ACS treatment elevated IFN-γ level in mice serum and increased CD4 T cell percentage in splenocytes. KEGG pathway analysis showed that phenylalanine metabolism pathway and  metabolism pathway were greatly regulated by ACS treatment.ACS exerted potent inhibitory effects on HBV replication both in vivo and in vitro, which may provide basis for its potential clinical usage.Copyright © 2019.

However, the biological mechanisms responsible for these associations remain largely unknown. In order to gain insight into the metabolic processes driving the association of leukocyte telomere length (LTL) with age-related diseases, we investigated the association between LTL and serum metabolite levels in 7,853 individuals from seven independent cohorts. LTL was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the levels of 131 serum metabolites were measured with mass spectrometry in biological samples from the same blood draw. With partial correlation analysis, we identified six metabolites that were significantly associated with LTL after adjustment for multiple testing: lysophosphatidylcholine acyl C17:0 (lysoPC a C17:0, p-value = 7.1 × 10), methionine (p-value = 9.2 × 10),  (p-value = 2.1 × 10), phosphatidylcholine diacyl C32:1 (PC aa C32:1, p-value = 2.4 × 10), hydroxypropionylcarnitine (C3-OH, p-value = 2.6 × 10), and phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyl C38:4 (PC ae C38:4, p-value = 9.0 × 10). Pathway analysis showed that the three phosphatidylcholines and methionine are involved in homocysteine metabolism and we found supporting evidence for an association of lipid metabolism with LTL. In conclusion, we found longer LTL associated with higher levels of lysoPC a C17:0 and PC ae C38:4, and with lower levels of methionine, , PC aa C32:1, and C3-OH. These metabolites have been implicated in , oxidative stress, homocysteine metabolism, and in cardiovascular disease and diabetes, two major drivers of morbidity and mortality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600169>Enapotamab vedotin, an AXL-specific antibody-drug conjugate, shows preclinical antitumor activity in non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>Targeted therapies and immunotherapy have shown promise in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the majority of patients fail or become resistant to treatment, emphasizing the need for novel treatments. In this study, we confirm the prognostic value of levels of AXL, a member of the TAM receptor  kinase family, in NSCLC and demonstrate potent antitumor activity of the AXL-targeting antibody-drug conjugate enapotamab vedotin across different NSCLC subtypes in a mouse clinical trial of human NSCLC. Tumor regression or stasis was observed in 17/61 (28%) of the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and was associated with AXL mRNA expression levels. Significant single-agent activity of enapotamab vedotin was validated in vivo in 9 of 10 AXL-expressing NSCLC xenograft models. In a panel of EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines rendered resistant to EGFR inhibitors in vitro, we observed de novo or increased AXL protein expression concomitant with enapotamab vedotin-mediated cytotoxicity. Enapotamab vedotin also showed antitumor activity in vivo in 3 EGFR-mutant, EGFR inhibitor-resistant PDX models, including an osimertinib-resistant NSCLC PDX model. In summary, enapotamab vedotin has promising therapeutic potential in NSCLC. The safety and preliminary efficacy of enapotamab vedotin are currently being evaluated in the clinic across multiple solid tumor types, including NSCLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31228610>Neurotoxicity to dopamine neurons after the serial exposure to alcohol and methamphetamine: Protection by COX-2 antagonism.</a></h2><p>A significant co-morbidity exists between alcohol and methamphetamine (Meth) in humans but the consequences and mechanisms underlying their co-morbid effects remain to be identified. A consequence associated with the abuse of either alcohol or Meth involves  but little is known about the role of  in a possible neurotoxicity arising from their co-exposure. Sprague Dawley rats were allowed 28 days of intermittent, voluntary access to 10% ethanol (EtOH) followed by a neurotoxic binge administration of Meth. EtOH drinking followed by Meth increased microglial cell counts and produced morphological changes in microglia of the substantia nigra pars compacta 2 h after Meth administration that were distinct from those produced by either EtOH or Meth alone. These effects preceded the activation of cleaved caspase-3 in dopamine cell bodies, as well as decreases in  hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra and dopamine transporter (DAT) immunoreactivity in the striatum measured at 7 days after Meth. Intervention with a selective COX-2 inhibitor during EtOH drinking prevented the changes in microglia, and attenuated the increase in cleaved caspase-3, and decreases in TH and DAT after Meth administration. Furthermore, motor dysfunction measured by a rotarod test was evident but only in rats that were exposed to both EtOH and Meth. The motor dysfunction was ameliorated by prior inhibition of COX-2 during EtOH drinking. The exaggerated neurochemical and behavioral deficits indicate that the comorbidity of EtOH and Meth induces a degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway and support the role of  produced by EtOH drinking that primes and mediates the neurotoxic consequences associated with the common co-morbidity of these drugs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The underlying mechanism by which RSV affects neutrophil activation has yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that RSV modulates the inflammatory activities of formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-stimulated human neutrophils. We employed a well-established isolated-neutrophil model to investigate the effects of RSV on neutrophil functions and the underlying mechanism of signaling transduction. The lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI murine model was employed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of RSV. Experiment results demonstrate that RSV reduces respiratory burst, degranulation, integrin expression, and cell adhesion in activated neutrophils in dose-dependent manners. RSV inhibited phosphorylation of Src family kinases (SFKs) and reduced their enzymatic activities. Moreover, RSV and a selective inhibitor of SFKs (PP2) reduced the phosphorylation of Bruton's  kinase and Vav. There results indicated that the inhibitory effects of RSV are mediated through the inhibition of the SFKs-Btk-Vav pathway. This study also revealed that RSV attenuates endotoxin-induced lung injury. We surmise that the therapeutic effects of RSV on ALI may derive from its anti-neutrophilic  function and free radical-scavenging effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Cytokines and growth factors activate STAT3 through kinase-mediated  phosphorylation and dimerization. It remains unknown whether other factors promote STAT3 activation through different mechanisms. Here we show that STAT3 is post-translationally S-palmitoylated at the SRC homology 2 (SH2) domain, which promotes the dimerization and transcriptional activation of STAT3. Fatty acids can directly activate STAT3 by enhancing its palmitoylation, in synergy with cytokine stimulation. We further identified ZDHHC19 as a palmitoyl acyltransferase that regulates STAT3. Cytokine stimulation increases STAT3 palmitoylation by promoting the association between ZDHHC19 and STAT3, which is mediated by the SH3 domain of GRB2. Silencing ZDHHC19 blocks STAT3 palmitoylation and dimerization, and impairs the cytokine- and fatty-acid-induced activation of STAT3. ZDHHC19 is frequently amplified in multiple human cancers, including in 39% of lung squamous cell carcinomas. High levels of ZDHHC19 correlate with high levels of nuclear STAT3 in patient samples. In addition, knockout of ZDHHC19 in lung squamous cell carcinoma cells significantly blocks STAT3 activity, and inhibits the fatty-acid-induced formation of tumour spheres as well as tumorigenesis induced by high-fat diets in an in vivo mouse model. Our studies reveal that fatty-acid- and ZDHHC19-mediated palmitoylation are signals that regulate STAT3, which provides evidence linking the deregulation of palmitoylation to  and cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299613>Protein  phosphatase 1b deficiency protects against hepatic fibrosis by modulating nadph oxidases.</a></h2><p> is typically associated with the development of fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The key role of protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) in inflammatory responses has focused this study in understanding its implication in liver fibrosis. Here we show that hepatic PTP1B mRNA expression increased after bile duct ligation (BDL), while BDL-induced liver fibrosis was markedly reduced in mice lacking Ptpn1 (PTP1B) as assessed by decreased collagen deposition and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression. PTP1B mice also showed a significant increase in mRNA levels of key markers of monocytes recruitment (Cd68, Adgre1 and Ccl2) compared to their wild-type (PTP1B) littermates at early stages of injury after BDL. Interestingly, the lack of PTP1B strongly increased the NADPH oxidase (NOX) subunits Nox1/Nox4 ratio and downregulated Cybb expression after BDL, revealing a pro-survival pattern of NADPH oxidase induction in response to liver injury. Chimeric mice generated by transplantation of PTP1B bone marrow (BM) into irradiated PTP1B mice revealed similar hepatic expression profile of NOX subunits than PTP1B mice while these animals did not show differences in infiltration of myeloid cells at 7 days post-BDL, suggesting that PTP1B deletion in other liver cells is necessary for boosting the early inflammatory response to the BDL. PTP1B BM transplantation into PTP1B mice also led to a blockade of TGF-β and α-SMA induction after BDL. In vitro experiments demonstrated that deficiency of PTP1B in hepatocytes protects against bile acid-induced apoptosis and abrogates hepatic stellate cells (HSC) activation, an effect ameliorated by NOX1 inhibition. In conclusion, our results have revealed that the lack of PTP1B switches NOX expression pattern in response to liver injury after BDL and reduces HSC activation and liver fibrosis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Loss of G6b-B results in severe macrothrombocytopenia, myelofibrosis and aberrant platelet function in mice and humans. Using a combination of immunohistochemistry, affinity chromatography and proteomics, we identified the extracellular matrix heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan perlecan as a G6b-B binding partner. Subsequent in vitro biochemical studies and a cell-based genetic screen demonstrated that the interaction is specifically mediated by the HS chains of perlecan. Biophysical analysis revealed that heparin forms a high-affinity complex with G6b-B and mediates dimerization. Using platelets from humans and genetically modified mice, we demonstrate that binding of G6b-B to HS and multivalent heparin inhibits platelet and megakaryocyte function by inducing downstream signaling via the  phosphatases Shp1 and Shp2. Our findings provide novel insights into how G6b-B is regulated and contribute to our understanding of the interaction of megakaryocytes and platelets with glycans.© 2019, Vögtle et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042079>Maternal high-fat diet alters lung development and function in the offspring.</a></h2><p>The effects of maternal obesity on lung development have been recognized, and speculation is that these diseases are not simply because of accelerated pulmonary decline with aging but with a failure to achieve optimal lung development during early life. These studies tested the hypothesis that maternal obesity alters signaling pathways during the course of lung development that may affect life-long pulmonary health. Adult female mice were fed 60% fat [high-fat diet (HFD)] or 10% fat [control diet (CD)] for 8 wk before mating and through weaning. Pup lung tissues were collected at  () , , and  (after receiving HFD or CD as adults). At , body weights from HFD were greater than CD but lung weight-to-body weight ratios were lower. In lung tissues, NFκB-mediated  was greater in HFD pups at  and phospho-/total STAT3, phospho-/total VEGF receptor 2, and total AKT protein levels were lower with maternal HFD and protein  phosphatase B1 levels were increased. Decreased platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule levels were observed at  and at  in the pups exposed to maternal HFD. Morphometry indicated that the pups exposed to maternal or adult HFD had fewer alveoli, and the effect was additive. Decreases in pulmonary resistance, elastance, and compliance were observed because of adult HFD diet and decreases in airway resistance and increases in inspiratory capacity because of maternal HFD. In conclusion, maternal HFD disrupts signaling pathways in the early developing lung and may contribute to deficiencies in lung function and increased susceptibility in adults.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31516608>Tumor-derived exosomes educate fibroblasts to promote salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma metastasis via NGF-NTRK1 pathway.</a></h2><p>Salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC) is a rare head and neck malignancy characterized by unpredictable expansion, considerable perineural invasion and high risk of metastasis; however, the underlying mechanism of SACC progression remains unclear. Cancer-associated fibroblasts localized within the tumor microenvironment may promote cancer malignant transformation by enhancing tumor growth, blood vessel formation,  development and metastasis occurrence. Small extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, are mediators of intercellular communication and can influence major tumor-associated pathways. The present study aimed to explore the exosome-mediated communication between SACC cells and fibroblasts. The results from confocal microscopy demonstrated that exosomes derived from the human cell line SACC-83 were internalized by the human periodontal ligament fibroblast (HPLF) cells. Following exosome internalization, HPLF cells appeared to enhance SACC-83 cell metastasis and were educated toward a protumorigenesis phenotype according to transcriptome RNA sequencing and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. This phenomenon included exosome-mediated stimulation of proinflammatory cytokines and nerve growth factor (NGF) secretion. Furthermore, NGF blockage reduced the enhanced SACC-83 cell invasion stimulated by the supernatant isolated from exosome-educated HPLF cells. In addition, the results reported that neurotrophic receptor  kinase 1 (NTRK1), which is the high-affinity NGF receptor, was significantly upregulated in human SACC-83 cells. These results demonstrated that SACC-83 cell-derived exosomes educated HPLF cells toward the protumorigenic phenotype via the NGF-NTRK1 pathway, which suggested that this type of exosomes may be used as a potential therapeutic target for SACC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156193>The effect of antioxidant and whitening action on Plantago asiatica L. leaf ethanol extract for health care.</a></h2><p>The Plantago asiatica L. is easy to cultivate and has been used as a folk remedy since ancient times because of various pharmacological actions such as anti- and antioxidation. It also contains a variety of flavonoids such as aucubin, which is thought to be excellent for whitening, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action.We investigated the effect of P. asiatica L. leaf ethanol extracts containing various active ingredients on antioxidative, anti- and whitening action and investigated its potential as a health care material. P. asiatica L. has been widely used in folk remedies.The cell toxicity test using RAW264.7 cells showed a high cell survival rate of over 75%, thus demonstrating the safety of the sample. In order to study the antioxidant activity of P. asiatica L. leaf ethanol extracts, we studied a sample which showed radical scavenging activity in a dose-dependent manner. To observe the antioxidant activity at the cell level, RAW 264.7 cells were used and inhibition of ROS production was measured. The ROS production was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner and the scavenging activity was stronger than the sample's own radical scavenging ability. To observe the anti-inflammatory effect of P. asiatica L. leaf ethanol extracts, inhibition of NO generation was observed using LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. NO generation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner and was strongly inhibited by 31% at 100 μg/mL. In vitro, L-DOPA and  were used to inhibit tyrosinase action in a dose-dependent manner. The concentration of melanin at 1, 10, and 100 μg/mL was suppressed in B16 F10 melanin cells supplemented with α-MSH in the cells, and the inhibition was suppressed to 29% at 100 μg/mL. In the B16 F10 melanin cell stimulated with MSH, the P. asiatica L. leaf ethanol extracts inhibited melanin formation in a dose-dependent manner.P. asiatica L. leaf ethanol extracts are expected to be developed as whitening cosmeceutical ingredients and as health care ingredients with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31349553>Development of An Oral Treatment with the PPAR-γ-Acting Cannabinoid VCE-003.2 Against the -Driven Neuronal Deterioration in Experimental Parkinson's Disease.</a></h2><p>In a recent study, we described the neuroprotective properties of VCE-003.2-an aminoquinone derivative of the non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid cannabigerol (CBG)-administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) in an inflammatory model of Parkinson's disease (PD). We also demonstrated that these properties derive from its activity on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, in particular at a regulatory site within this receptor type. In the present study, we wanted to further confirm this neuroprotective potential using an oral lipid formulation of VCE-003.2, developed to facilitate the clinical development of this phytocannabinoid derivative. To this end, we evaluated VCE-003.2, administered orally at two doses (10 and 20 mg/kg), to mice subjected to unilateral intrastriatal injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a classic model of -driven neuronal deterioration that recapitulates characteristics of PD. The administration of VCE-003.2 to these mice showed, as expected, poor activity in the different motor tests (rotarod, computer-aided actimeter) used in experimental parkinsonism, in general due to the lack of evident changes in these behaviors by LPS lesion. However, VCE-003.2, at 20 mg/kg, was highly active in improving the changes detected in LPS-lesioned mice in the cylinder rearing test. In addition, the histopathological analysis of the basal ganglia revealed a trend towards recovery at 20 mg/kg VCE-003.2 in the loss of  hydroxylase-containing nigrostriatal neurons, as well as a complete reduction in the elevated LAMP-1 immunolabeling (reflecting autophagy impairment) caused by LPS lesion. These effects were not seen at 10 mg/kg. This was associated with a partial reduction in the intense glial reactivity provoked by LPS in the substantia nigra, in particular the astroglial reactivity labeled with glial fibrillary acidic protein. The analysis using qPCR in the striatum of proinflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2, showed that the marked elevations provoked by the LPS lesion tended to be, in general, attenuated by VCE-003.2 treatment, with the greatest effects normally found with the highest dose of 20 mg/kg. In summary, our data confirm the neuroprotective potential of an oral formulation of VCE-003.2 against neuronal injury in an in vivo model of PD based on neuroinflammation, and this study opens the possibility to further the development of oral VCE-003.2 in the clinic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31373168>-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 2 inhibits alveolar bone resorption in diabetic periodontitis via dephosphorylating CSF1 receptor.</a></h2><p>-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) is an important protection factor for diabetes and periodontitis, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. This study aimed to identify the substrate of PTPN2 in mediating beneficial effects of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)2D ) on diabetic periodontitis. 25(OH)2D photo-affinity probe was synthesized with the minimalist linker and its efficacy to inhibit alveolar bone loss, and  was evaluated in diabetic periodontitis mice. The probe was used to pull down the lysates of primary gingival fibroblasts. We identified PTPN2 as a direct target of 25(OH)2D , which effectively inhibited  and bone resorption in diabetic periodontitis mice. In addition, we found that colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) rather than JAK/STAT was the substrate of PTPN2 to regulate bone resorption. PTPN2 direct interacted with CSF1R and dephosphorylated Tyr807 residue. In conclusion, PTPN2 dephosphorylates CSF1R at Y807 site and inhibits alveolar bone resorption in diabetic periodontitis mice. PTPN2 and CSF1R are potential targets for the therapy of diabetic periodontitis or other bone loss-related diseases.© 2019 The Authors.

The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multi-protein complex of the innate immune system that is responsible for the production of the potent inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Tumor- associated macrophages (TAM) are an expanded population of immune cells found in the tumor microenvironment that can promote the initiation and metastasis of tumor cells. Their presence has been correlated with disease burden, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting this population. However, to date clinically relevant pharmacologic strategies to target TAM remain elusive. Here, we show that  generated TAM harbor NLRP3 inflammasome components and produce IL-1β. Ibrutinib, an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's  kinase (BTK), is in clinical use for the treatment of B- cell malignancies. We report that BTK is expressed by human  generated TAM and murine macrophages and that it physically associates with the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, ibrutinib is able to inhibit BTK phosphorylation in TAM generated . Treatment of TAM with ibrutinib significantly impaired the ability of these cells to produce IL-1β. The present study provides evidence that BTK physically associates with the NLRP3 inflammasome and that inhibition of BTK with ibrutinib can impair the production of IL-1β by  generated TAM. Thus, ibrutinib could potentially be of clinical use in abrogating -associated cancer progression and the immune-suppressive effects of myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31125786>SUMOylation of Csk Negatively Modulates its Tumor Suppressor Function.</a></h2><p>Csk, a non-receptor  kinase, serves as an indispensable negative regulator of the Src family kinases (SFKs).

Treatment with hydrogen peroxide inhibited this modification to a certain extent, but PIAS3, identified as the main specific SUMO E3 ligase for Csk, could significantly enhance SUMO1-Csk level. In addition, phosphorylation at Ser364, the active site in Csk, had no effect on this modification. Ectopic expression of SUMO-defective mutant, Csk , inhibited tumor cell growth more potentially than Csk wild-type. Consistent with the biological phenotype, the SUMO modification of Csk impaired its activity to interact with Cbp (Csk binding protein) leading to decreased c-Src phosphorylation at Y527. Our results suggest that SUMOylation of Csk mainly at lysine 53 negatively modulates its tumor suppressor function by reducing its binding with Cbp and consequently, inducing c-Src activation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we investigate the effect of mild , induced by unilateral injection of Endotoxin (ET) in the substantia nigra (SN)/Ventral Tegmental Area, on the proliferation and survival of stem/progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. Adult female rats received unilateral injection of ET (2 μg/2 μl saline) or sterile saline (2 μl) in the right SN followed by 5'-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) injections (66 mg/kg/injection). Intranigral ET injection induced bilateral decrease in the number of newly born BrdU positive cells in the DG. This effect was paralleled by a significant decrease in the exploratory behavior of rats, as assessed by the Y-maze novel arm exploration task. ET also induced a transient decrease in the number of  hydroxylase-positive cells in the injected SN, impaired motor behavior, and caused microglial activation in the SN. This study provides an experimental simulation of the remote effects of moderate and reversible neuroinflammation resulting in impaired communication between midbrain dopaminergic neurons and the hippocampus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638994>Roles of phosphatidylserine exposed on the viral envelope and cell membrane in HIV-1 replication.</a></h2><p>Phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) is usually present only in the inner leaf of the lipid bilayers of the cell membrane, but is exposed on the outer leaf when cells are activated and/or die. Exposure of PtdSer has physiological functions. For example, the PtdSer exposed on dead cells can serve as "eat-me signals" for phagocytes to clear dead cells by phagocytosis, which prevents autoimmune reactions and . HIV-1 induces PtdSer exposure on infected and target cells and it also exposes PtdSer on its envelope. Recent studies showed that PtdSer exposed on the HIV-1 envelope and infected and target cells can facilitate or inhibit multiple steps of HIV-1 replication.At the virus binding and entry steps, interaction of the envelope PtdSer and the host's PtdSer-binding molecules can enhance HIV-1 infection of cells by facilitating virus attachment. At the virus budding step, HIV-1 can be trapped on the cell surface by one family of PtdSer-binding receptors, T-cell immunoglobulin mucin domain proteins (TIM)-1, 3, and 4 expressed on virus producer cells. Although this trapping can inhibit release of HIV-1, one of the HIV-1 accessory gene products, Negative Factor (Nef), can counteract virus trapping by TIM family receptors (TIMs) by inducing the internalization of these receptors. HIV-1 infection can induce exposure of PtdSer on infected cells by inducing cell death. A soluble PtdSer-binding protein in serum, protein S, bridges PtdSer exposed on HIV-1-infected cells and a receptor  kinase, Mer, expressed on macrophages and mediate phagocytic clearance of HIV-1 infected cells. HIV-1 can also induce exposure of PtdSer on target cells at the virus binding step. Binding of HIV-1 envelope proteins to its receptor (CD4) and co-receptors (CXCR4 or CCR5) elicit signals that induce PtdSer exposure on target cells by activating TMEM16F, a phospholipid scramblase. PtdSer exposed on target cells enhances HIV-1 infection by facilitating fusion between the viral envelope and target cell membrane. Because various other phospholipid channels mediating PtdSer exposure have recently been identified, it will be of interest to examine how HIV-1 actively interacts with these molecules to manipulate PtdSer exposure levels on cells and viral envelope to support its replication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31356921>Oral Janus kinase/SYK inhibition (ASN002) suppresses  and improves epidermal barrier markers in patients with atopic dermatitis.</a></h2><p>Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) has been associated with significant disease burden and systemic abnormalities and often requires systemic treatments. Currently, safe and effective oral systemic treatments for moderate-to-severe AD are not yet available. ASN002 is an oral inhibitor of the Janus kinase/spleen  kinase signaling pathways, targeting several cytokine axes (T2/T22/T17/T1) and epidermal differentiation.We sought to evaluate the effect of ASN002 on the cellular and molecular biomarker profile of patients with moderate-to-severe AD and to correlate changes in biomarkers to improvements in clinical severity measures and pruritus.Thirty-six patients with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized to groups with dose escalation of ASN002 (20, 40, and 80 mg) and a placebo group. Skin biopsy specimens were performed at baseline, day 15, and day 29. Gene expression studies were conducted by using microarray and quantitative RT-PCR, and cellular infiltrates and protein expression were studied by using immunohistochemistry.ASN002 reversed the lesional skin transcriptome toward a nonlesional phenotype. It also rapidly and significantly suppressed key inflammatory pathways implicated in AD pathogenesis, including T2 (IL4 receptor [IL4R], IL13, CCL13/monocyte chemoattractant protein 4, CCL17/thymus and activation-regulated chemokine, CCL18/pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine, CCL22/macrophage-derived chemokine, and CCL26/eotaxin-3), T17/T22 (lipocalins, PI3/elafin, CCL20, S100A7/S100A8/S100A9, and IL36G/IL36RN), and T1 (IFNG, CXCL9/CXCL11, and MX1) axes and barrier-related measures (filaggrin [FLG] and CLDN23). Significant improvements in AD gene signatures were observed predominantly in the 40- and 80-mg groups. Smaller and largely nonsignificant molecular changes were seen in the 20-mg and placebo groups.The Janus kinase/spleen  kinase inhibitor ASN002 significantly suppressed key AD inflammatory pathways, corresponding to clinical response.

SHP-2 (Src homology 2-containing protein  phosphatase 2) is a widely expressed cytosolic  phosphatase protein that participates in the regulation of , angiogenesis, gliosis, neurogenesis and apoptosis, suggesting a potential role of SHP-2 in TLE. Therefore, we investigated the expression patterns of SHP-2 in the epileptogenic brain tissue of intractable TLE patients and the various effects of treatment with the SHP-2-specific inhibitor SHP099 on a pilocarpine model. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry results confirmed that SHP-2 expression was upregulated in the temporal neocortex of patients with TLE. Double-labeling experiments revealed that SHP-2 was highly expressed in neurons, astrocytes, microglia and vascular endothelial cells in the epileptic foci of TLE patients. In the pilocarpine-induced C57BL/6 mouse model, SHP-2 upregulation in the hippocampus began one day after status epilepticus, reached a peak at 21 days and then maintained a significantly high level until day 60. Similarly, we found a remarkable increase in SHP-2 expression at 1, 7, 21 and 60 days post-SE in the temporal neocortex. In addition, we also showed that SHP099 increased reactive gliosis, the release of IL-1β, neuronal apoptosis and neuronal loss, while reduced neurogenesis and albumin leakage. Taken together, the increased expression of SHP-2 in the epileptic zone may be involved in the process of TLE.© 2019 International Society of Neuropathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169200>Ginsenoside Rb1 protects dopaminergic neurons from inflammatory injury induced by intranigral lipopolysaccharide injection.</a></h2><p>Accumulating studies suggest that neuroinflammation characterized by microglial overactivation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. As such, inhibition of microglial overactivation might be a promising treatment strategy to delay the onset or slow the progression of Parkinson's disease. Ginsenoside Rb1, the most active ingredient of ginseng, reportedly exerts neuroprotective effects by suppressing  in vitro. The present study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of ginsenoside Rb1 in a lipopolysaccharide-induced rat Parkinson's disease model. Rats were divided into four groups. In the control group, sham-operated rats were intraperitoneally administered normal saline for 14 consecutive days. In the ginsenoside Rb1 group, ginsenoside Rb1 (20 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected for 14 consecutive days after sham surgery. In the lipopolysaccharide group, a single dose of lipopolysaccharide was unilaterally microinjected into the rat substantial nigra to establish the Parkinson's disease model. Lipopolysaccharide-injected rats were treated with normal saline for 14 consecutive days. In the ginsenoside Rb1 + lipopolysaccharide group, lipopolysaccharide was unilaterally microinjected into the rat substantial nigra. Subsequently, ginsenoside Rb1 was intraperitoneally injected for 14 consecutive days. To investigate the therapeutic effects of ginsenoside Rb1, behavioral tests were performed on day 15 after lipopolysaccharide injection. We found that ginsenoside Rb1 treatment remarkably reduced apomorphine-induced rotations in lipopolysaccharide-treated rats compared with the lipopolysaccharide group. To investigate the neurotoxicity of lipopolysaccharide and potential protective effect of ginsenoside Rb1, contents of dopamine and its metabolites in the striatum were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Compared with the lipopolysaccharide group, ginsenoside Rb1 obviously attenuated the lipopolysaccharide-induced depletion of dopamine and its metabolites in the striatum. To further explore the neuroprotective effect of ginsenoside Rb1 against lipopolysaccharide-induced neurotoxicity, immunohistochemistry and western blot assay of  hydroxylase were performed to evaluate dopaminergic neuron degeneration in the substantial nigra par compacta. The results showed that lipopolysaccharide injection caused a large loss of  hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the substantia nigra and a significant decrease in overall  hydroxylase expression. However, ginsenoside Rb1 noticeably reversed these changes. To investigate whether the neuroprotective effect of ginsenoside Rb1 was associated with inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced microglial activation, we examined expression of the microglia marker Iba-1. Our results confirmed that lipopolysaccharide injection induced a significant increase in Iba-1 expression in the substantia nigra; however, ginsenoside Rb1 effectively suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced microglial overactivation. To elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of ginsenoside Rb1, we examined expression levels of inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase 2) and phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B signaling-related proteins (IκB, IKK) in the substantia nigra with enzyme-linked immunosorbent and western blot assays. Our results revealed that compared with the control group, phosphorylation and expression of inflammatory mediators IκB and IKK in the substantia nigra of lipopolysaccharide group rats were significantly increased; whereas, ginsenoside Rb1 obviously reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced changes on the lesioned side of the substantial nigra par compacta. These findings confirm that ginsenoside Rb1 can inhibit  induced by lipopolysaccharide injection into the substantia nigra and protect dopaminergic neurons, which may be related to its inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway.

Therefore, an untargeted metabolomics approach was firstly applied to study the serum metabolic differences in mice. Metabolomics analysis was performed using ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) together with multivariate statistical data analysis. The results showed that Plantaginis semen can mainly improve blood lipids, some degree in blood glucose and insulin levels in high-fat mice, in addition, the phenotype of liver and fat stained sections demonstrated remarkable results. A total of 22 metabolites involved in arachidonic acid, glycerophospholipid, glycosphingolipid, linoleate, Omega-3 fatty acid, phosphatidylinositol phosphate and  metabolisms were identified. In further, it was found that the possible mechanisms of Plantaginis semen on hyperlipidemic mice lied in the biosynthesis of thyroxine, biological effects of enzymes of phospholipase A2 activity, glucosylceramide synthase and inositol essential enzyme 1α, genes expressions of fatty acid metabolism and . Serum metabolomics revealed that Plantaginis semen could cure the organism disease via regulating multiple metabolic pathways which will be helpful for understanding the mechanism of this herb and providing references for better applications of it in clinic, even researches on other TCMs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Depending on these different phenotypes, macrophages can produce either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory factors which may affect the outcome of . Mastering the switching of M1/M2 phenotypes may provide therapeutic approaches to chronic inflammatory disease, such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, even the metabolic disorders. Cathepsin C (CTSC), as a member of the papain family of cysteine proteases, is a key enzyme in the activation of granule serine proteases thereby involved in modulating the inflammatory responses. Moreover, abundant expression of CTSC has been found in M1 macrophages in plaques of atherosclerosis and related to the progression of disease. However, whether CTSC can regulate macrophage activation status in inflammatory responses has not been fully investigated. In the present study, using peritoneal macrophages (PMs) and mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 treated with LPS and active monomer of CTSC, we found that CTSC was not only expressed in macrophages in M1 activation status, but also facilitated macrophages towards M1 phenotype, suggesting a self-activation mechanism involved in this process which may lead to a vicious circle in chronic . Then we attempted to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of CTSC resulting in M1 activation. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is one of the non-receptor cytoplasmic protein  kinases, serving as an upstream mediator that leads to transcription of many pro-inflammatory factors. We found FAK expression was up-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels following CTSC stimulation, and FAK phosphorylation level was also significantly increased. The p38MAPK/NF-κB pathway, as the downstream of FAK, were also found activated in CTSC-treated macrophages, suggesting that CTSC may promote macrophage towards M1 activation status through FAK-induced p38MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway activation.

Impaired intestinal barrier functions play a major role in chronic low-grade  (CLGI)-associated obesity, but the regulation of BCRP during obesity and its role in maintaining the intestinal barrier function during CLGI-associated obesity are unknown. In the present study, using several approaches, including efflux assays, immunoprecipitation/-blotting/-histochemistry, paracellular permeability assay, fluorescence activated cell sorting, cytokine assay, and immunofluorescence microscopy, we report that obese individuals have compromised intestinal BCRP functions and that diet-induced obese mice recapitulate these outcomes. We demonstrate that the compromised BCRP functions during obesity are due to loss of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3)-mediated  phosphorylation of BCRP. Our results indicate that JAK3-mediated phosphorylation of BCRP promotes its interactions with membrane-localized β-catenin essential not only for BCRP expression and surface localization, but also for the maintenance of BCRP-mediated intestinal drug efflux and barrier functions. We observed that reduced intestinal JAK3 expression during human obesity or JAK3 knockout in mouse or siRNA-mediated β-catenin knockdown in human intestinal epithelial cells all result in significant loss of intestinal BCRP expression and compromised colonic drug efflux and barrier functions. Our results uncover a mechanism of BCRP-mediated intestinal drug efflux and barrier functions and establish a role for BCRP in preventing CLGI-associated obesity both in humans and in mice.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132406>Modulation of the Wnt pathway through inhibition of CLK2 and DYRK1A by lorecivivint as a novel, potentially disease-modifying approach for knee osteoarthritis treatment.</a></h2><p>Wnt pathway upregulation contributes to knee osteoarthritis (OA) through osteoblast differentiation, increased catabolic enzymes, and .

Western blots measured protein phosphorylation in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), chondrocytes, and synovial fibroblasts. siRNA knockdown effects in hMSCs and BEAS-2B cells on Wnt pathway, chondrogenic genes, and LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines was measured by qPCR. In vivo anti-, pain, and function were evaluated following single intra-articular (IA) lorecivivint or vehicle injection in the monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced rat OA model.Lorecivivint inhibited intranuclear kinases CDC-like kinase 2 (CLK2) and dual-specificity  phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A). Lorecivivint inhibited CLK2-mediated phosphorylation of serine/arginine-rich (SR) splicing factors and DYRK1A-mediated phosphorylation of SIRT1 and FOXO1. siRNA knockdowns identified a role for CLK2 and DYRK1A in Wnt pathway modulation without affecting β-catenin with CLK2 inhibition inducing early chondrogenesis and DYRK1A inhibition enhancing mature chondrocyte function.

Fenofibrate, a regulator of sphingolipid metabolism, is known to prevent diabetes in NOD mice. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of fenofibrate on the pancreatic lipidome, pancreas morphology, pancreatic sympathetic nerves and blood glucose homeostasis in NOD mice.We treated female NOD mice with fenofibrate from 3 weeks of age. The pancreatic lipidome was analysed using MS. Analysis of pancreas and islet volume was performed by stereology. Islet sympathetic nerve fibre volume was evaluated using  hydroxylase staining. The effect on blood glucose homeostasis was assessed by measuring non-fasting blood glucose from age 12 to 30 weeks. Furthermore, we measured glucose tolerance, fasting insulin and glucagon levels, and insulin tolerance.We found that fenofibrate selectively increases the amount of very-long-chain sphingolipids in the pancreas of NOD mice. In addition, we found that fenofibrate causes a remodelling of the pancreatic lipidome with an increased amount of lysoglycerophospholipids. Fenofibrate did not affect islet or pancreas volume, but led to a higher volume of islet sympathetic nerve fibres and  hydroxylase-positive cells. Fenofibrate-treated NOD mice had a more stable blood glucose, which was associated with reduced non-fasting and increased fasting blood glucose. Furthermore, fenofibrate improved glucose tolerance, reduced fasting glucagon levels and prevented fasting hyperinsulinaemia.These data indicate that fenofibrate alters the pancreatic lipidome to a more anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic state.

Therapeutic dose relevance of the in vitro analysis was assessed using calculated mean concentration-time profiles over 24 h obtained from JAKi-treated subjects. Time above IC and average daily percent inhibition of pSTAT formation were calculated for each JAKi, cytokine, and cell type.Distinct JAKis displayed different in vitro pharmacologic profiles. For example, tofacitinib and upadacitinib were the most potent inhibitors of the JAK1/3-dependent cytokines tested (interleukin [IL]-2, IL-4, IL-15, and IL-21) with lower IC values and increased time above IC translating to a greater overall inhibition of STAT signaling during the dosing interval. All JAKis tested inhibited JAK1/2-dependent cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and interferon [IFN]-γ), the JAK1/ kinase 2 (TYK2)-dependent cytokines IL-10 and IFN-α, the JAK2/2-dependent cytokines IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and the JAK2/TYK2-dependent cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), but often to significantly differing degrees.Different JAKis modulated distinct cytokine pathways to varying degrees, and no agent potently or continuously inhibited an individual cytokine signaling pathway throughout the dosing interval. Notably, baricitinib inhibited JAK1/3 signaling to a lesser extent than upadacitinib and tofacitinib, while upadacitinib, baricitinib, and tofacitinib inhibited the signaling of JAK2/2-dependent cytokines, including GM-CSF and IL-3, as well as the signaling of the JAK2/TYK2-dependent cytokine G-CSF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31289638>Regulation of platelet-activating factor-mediated interleukin-6 promoter activation by the 48 kDa but not the 45 kDa isoform of protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 2.</a></h2><p>An underlying state of  is thought to be an important cause of cardiovascular disease. Among cells involved in the early steps of atherosclerosis, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) respond to inflammatory stimuli, including platelet-activating factor (PAF), by the induction of various cytokines, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6). PAF is a potent phospholipid mediator involved in both the onset and progression of atherosclerosis. It mediates its effects by binding to its cognate G-protein coupled receptor, PAFR. Activation of PAFR-induced signaling pathways is tightly coordinated to ensure specific cell responses.Here, we report that PAF stimulated the phosphatase activity of both the 45 and 48 kDa isoforms of the protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2). However, we found that only the 48 kDa PTPN2 isoform has a role in PAFR-induced signal transduction, leading to activation of the IL-6 promoter. In luciferase reporter assays, expression of the 48 kDa, but not the 45 kDa, PTPN2 isoform increased human IL-6 (hIL-6) promoter activity by 40% after PAF stimulation of HEK-293 cells, stably transfected with PAFR (HEK-PAFR). Our results suggest that the differential localization of the PTPN2 isoforms and the differences in PAF-induced phosphatase activation may contribute to the divergent modulation of PAF-induced IL-6 promoter activation. The involvement of PTPN2 in PAF-induced IL-6 expression was confirmed in immature Mo-DCs (iMo-DCs), using siRNAs targeting the two isoforms of PTPN2, where siRNAs against the 48 kDa PTPN2 significantly inhibited PAF-stimulated IL-6 mRNA expression. Pharmacological inhibition of several signaling pathways suggested a role for PTPN2 in early signaling events. Results obtained by Western blot confirmed that PTPN2 increased the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway via the modulation of protein kinase D (PKD) activity. WT PKD expression counteracted the effect of PTPN2 on PAF-induced IL-6 promoter transactivation and phosphorylation of Akt. Using siRNAs targeting the individual isoforms of PTPN2, we confirmed that these pathways were also active in iMo-DCs.Taken together, our data suggest that PTPN2, in an isoform-specific manner, could be involved in the positive regulation of PI3K/Akt activation, via the modulation of PKD activity, allowing for the maximal induction of PAF-stimulated IL-6 mRNA expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31218647>Dysregulation in the Brain Protein Profile of Zebrafish Lacking the Parkinson's Disease-Related Protein DJ-1.</a></h2><p>DJ-1 is a protein with a wide range of functions importantly related to redox regulation in the cell. In humans, dysfunction of the PARK7 gene is associated with neurodegeneration and Parkinson's disease. Our objective was to establish a novel DJ-1 knockout zebrafish line and to identify early brain proteome changes, which could be linked to later pathology. The CRISPR-Cas9 method was used to target exon 1 of the park7-/- gene to produce a transgenic DJ-1-deficient zebrafish model of Parkinson's disease. Label-free mass spectrometry was employed to identify altered protein expression in the DJ-1 null brain of early adult animals. The park7 line appears to develop normally at young adult and larval stages. With aging however, DJ-1 null fish exhibit lower  hydroxylase levels, respiratory failure in skeletal muscle, and lower body mass which is especially prevalent among male fish. By proteomic analysis of early adult brains, we determined that less than 5% of the 4091 identified proteins were influenced by the lack of DJ-1. The dysregulated proteins were mainly proteins known to be involved in mitochondrial metabolism, mitophagy, stress response, redox regulation, and .

The results showed that amurensin H ameliorated the histological inflammatory alterations in the lung tissues, leading to a decrease in the expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and interferon γ in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Amurensin H also significantly inhibited the release of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α in LPS-stimulated THP-1-derived macrophages. Furthermore, amurensin H markedly inhibited the expressions of p-Syk, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and p-NF-κB both  and . Results from cotreatment with Syk inhibitor BAY61-3606 and NF-κB inhibitor BAY11-7082  revealed that amurensin H's protective effect against airway  could be due partly to the inhibition of the Syk/NF-κB pathway. These findings suggest that amurensin H shows therapeutic effects on COPD airway , and inhibiting the Syk/NF-κB pathway might be part of its underlying mechanisms.Copyright © 2019 Fan, Zhang, Yao, Bai, Yang, Ma, Fan, Li, Yuan, Lin and Hou.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659758>Anlotinib attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis via the TGF-β1 signalling pathway.</a></h2><p>Anlotinib hydrochloride (AL3818) is a novel multitarget  kinase inhibitor which has the same targets as nintedanib, an effective drug has been approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we examined whether anlotinib could also attenuate bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice and explored the antifibrosis mechanism.We have evaluated the effect of anlotinib on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Inflammatory cytokines in alveolar lavage fluid including IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6 and TNF-α were determined by ELISA. Biomarkers of oxidative stress were measured by corresponding kit. Histopathologic examination was analysed by H&E staining and immunohistochemistry. In vitro, we investigated whether anlotinib inhibited TGFβ/Smad3 and non-Smad pathways by luciferase assay or Western blotting. We also evaluated whether anlotinib inhibited TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promoted myofibroblast apoptosis in order to explore the possible molecular mechanism.The results indicated that anlotinib treatment remarkably attenuated , oxidative stress and pulmonary fibrosis in mouse lungs. Anlotinib could inhibit the TGF-β1 signalling pathway. Additionally, anlotinib not only profoundly inhibited TGF-β1-induced EMT in alveolar epithelial cells, but also simultaneously reduced the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis in fibroblasts.In summary, the results suggest that anlotinib-mediated suppression of pulmonary fibrosis is related to the inhibition of TGF-β1 signalling pathway.© 2019 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31396490>Cleavage and Sub-Cellular Redistribution of Nuclear Pore Protein 98 by Coxsackievirus B3 Protease 2A Impairs Cardioprotection.</a></h2><p>Myocarditis,  of the heart muscle, affects all demographics and is a major cause of sudden and unexpected death in young people. It is most commonly caused by viral infections of the heart, with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) being among the most prevalent pathogens. To understand the molecular pathogenesis of CVB3 infection and provide strategies for developing treatments, we examined the role of a key nuclear pore protein 98 (NUP98) in the setting of viral myocarditis. NUP98 was cleaved as early as 2 h post-CVB3 infection. This cleavage was further verified through both the ectopic expression of viral proteases and  using purified recombinant CVB3 proteases (2A and 3C), which demonstrated that CVB3 2A but not 3C is responsible for this cleavage. By immunostaining and confocal imaging, we observed that cleavage resulted in the redistribution of NUP98 to punctate structures in the cytoplasm. Targeted siRNA knockdown of NUP98 during infection further increased viral protein expression and viral titer, and reduced cell viability, suggesting a potential antiviral role of NUP98. Moreover, we discovered that expression levels of neuregulin-1 (NRG1), a cardioprotective gene, and presenilin-1 (PSEN1), a cellular protease processing the  kinase receptor ERBB4 of NRG1, were reliant upon NUP98 and were downregulated during CVB3 infection. In addition, expression of these NUP98 target genes in myocardium tissue not only occurred at an earlier phase of infection, but also appeared in areas away from the initial inflammatory regions. Collectively, CVB3-induced cleavage of NUP98 and subsequent impairment of the cardioprotective NRG1-ERBB4/PSEN1 signaling cascade may contribute to increased myocardial damage in the context of CVB3-induced myocarditis. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the link between NUP98 and the NRG1 signaling pathway in viral myocarditis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433263>Serum Nutritional Markers as Prognostic Factors for Hepatic and Extrahepatic Carcinogenesis in Japanese Patients with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Serum zinc (Zn) levels and the branched chain amino acid/ molar ratio (BTR) were reported to decrease with the progression of various chronic liver diseases. We investigated the impact of BTR and Zn on the incidence of malignancies in patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A total of 179 Japanese NAFLD patients who underwent liver biopsy were enrolled. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and extrahepatic malignancies developed in 7 (3.9%) and 10 (5.6%) patients, respectively, during the follow-up period (median 7.9 years). Patients with low BTR levels (<5.0) and Zn deficiency (<70 μg/dL) had significantly higher incidences of HCC and extrahepatic malignancies ( < 0.001 and 0.026), respectively. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed the following risk factors: liver fibrosis (F3-4) (hazard ratio [HR] 24.292, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.802-210.621,  = 0.004) and BTR < 5.0 (HR 5.462, 95% CI 1.095-27.253,  = 0.038) for HCC, and serum Zn level <70 μg/dL (HR 3.504, 95% CI 1.010-12.157,  = 0.048) and liver  (A2-3) (HR 3.445, 95% CI 0.886-13.395,  = 0.074) for extra-hepatic malignancies.

The secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells contributes to retinal homeostasis as well as to pathological angiogenesis. We have now examined the effect of a necrotic cell lysate prepared from human RPE cells (NLR) on the release of VEGF by healthy RPE cells. We found that NLR markedly increased the release of VEGF from RPE cells and that this effect was attenuated by nintedanib, a multiple receptor  kinase inhibitor, whereas it was unaffected by inhibitors of NF-κB signaling or of caspase-1. NLR also induced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) in a manner sensitive to inhibition by nintedanib, although inhibitors of Erk and Stat3 signaling pathways did not affect NLR-induced VEGF secretion. In addition, nintedanib attenuated the development of choroidal neovascularization in mice. Our results have thus shown that a necrotic lysate of RPE cells induced VEGF secretion from healthy RPE cells and that this effect was mediated by receptor  kinase signaling. They therefore suggest that VEGF secretion by healthy RPE cells is a potential therapeutic target for retinal diseases associated with sterile  and pathological angiogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505074>Increased expression of GAB1 promotes  and fibrosis in systemic sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease mainly characterized by persistent  and fibrosis. The receptor  kinase (RTK) signal pathway plays an important role in the process of SSc, and Grb2 associated binding protein (GAB) is crucial in activating RTK signaling. A previous study found elevated levels of GAB1 in bleomycin (BLM)-induced fibrotic lungs, but the effects of GAB1 in SSc remain unclear. Our aim was to investigate whether GAB1 was dysregulated and its potential role in SSc. Compared with healthy donors, we found GAB1 expression was 1.6-fold higher in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), 2.5-fold higher in CD4+ T cells, and 2-fold higher in skin from of SSc patients (P < 0.01). At the same time, the levels of type one collagen (COLI) were also significantly increased (1.8-fold higher) in SSc skin. Additionally, BLM-induced SSc mice showed mRNA levels of Gab1 2-fold higher than saline-treated controls, and Gab1 expression correlated positively with collagen content. A further in vitro study showed silencing of GAB1 suppressed inflammatory gene expression in TNF-α induced fibroblasts. Additionally, GAB1 deficiency prominently inhibited cell proliferation and reduced COLI protein levels in TGF-β induced fibroblasts. Taken together, these data suggest that GAB1 has a relatively high expression rate in SSc, and knockdown of GAB1 may attenuate SSc by stimulating inflammatory and fibrotic processes.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effect of the bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) therapy in comparison with nintedanib, a  kinase inhibitor, on improving survival in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in rats. Moreover, the combined therapy of BM-MSCs and nintedanib will be evaluated. In the present study, IPF was induced through intra-tracheal instillation of bleomycin (5 mg/kg) in rats then treatments were administered 14 days thereafter. Nintedanib (100 mg/kg, I.P.) was administered daily for 28 days, while BM-MSCs were injected once intravenously in tail vein in the dose 1 × 10 cells/ml/rat. In the present study, both treatment regimens effectively inhibited lung fibrosis through several pathways, suppressing tumor growth factor-β (TGF-β)/SMAD3 expression which is considered the master signaling pathway. Nintedanib and BLM-MSCs exerted their anti-inflammatory effect through minimizing the expression of TNF-α and IL-6. In addition, the histopathological examination of the lung tissue showed a significant decrease in the alveolar wall thickening, in the inflammatory infiltrate, and in the collagen fiber deposition in response to either nintedanib or BM-MSC and their combination. In conclusion, the therapeutic pulmonary anti-fibrotic activity of nintedanib or BM-MSC is mediated through their anti-inflammatory properties and inhibition of SMAD-3/TGF-β expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295370>Modification of lactoferrin by peroxynitrite reduces its antibacterial activity and changes protein structure.</a></h2><p>Lactoferrin (LF) is a multifunctional protein that plays important physiological roles as one of the most concentrated proteins in many human and other mammalian fluids and tissues. In particular, LF provides antibacterial properties to human milk, saliva, and tear fluid. LF also protects against stress-induced lipid peroxidation at  sites through its iron-binding ability. Previous studies have shown that LF can be efficiently nitrated via biologically relevant mediators such as peroxynitrite (ONOO ), which are also present at high intracellular concentrations during  and nitrosative stress. Here, we examine changes in antibacterial properties and structure of LF following ONOO treatment. The reaction induces nitration of  and tryptophan residues, which are commonly used as biomarker molecules for several diseases. Treatment with ONOO at a 10/1 M ratio of ONOO to  inhibited all antibacterial activity exhibited by native LF. Secondary structural changes in LF were assessed using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Nitration products with and without the addition of Fe show significant reduction in alpha-helical properties, suggesting partial protein unfolding. Iron-binding capacity of LF was also reduced after treatment with ONOO , suggesting a decreased ability of LF to protect against cellular damage. LC-MS/MS spectrometry was used to identify LF peptide fragments nitrated by ONOO , including  residue Y92 located in the iron-binding region. These results suggest that posttranslational modification of LF by ONOO could be an important pathway to exacerbate infection, for example, in inflamed tissues and to reduce the ability of LF to act as an immune responder and decrease oxidative damage.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31512044>Effect of topical administration of the microneurotrophin BNN27 in the diabetic rat retina.</a></h2><p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a complex eye disease associated with diabetes mellitus.

We recently reported that intraperitoneal administration of BNN27, a novel neurosteroidal microneurotrophin, reversed the diabetes-induced neurodegeneration and  in rats treated with streptozotocin (STZ), by activating the NGF TrkA and p75 receptors. The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of BNN27 to protect retinal neurons when applied topically as eye drops in the same model.The STZ rat model of DR was employed. BNN27 was administered as eye drops to diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats for 7 days, 4 weeks post-STZ (70 mg/kg) injection. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses were employed to examine the viability of retinal neurons in control, diabetic, and diabetic-treated animals and the involvement of the TrkA receptor and its downstream signaling ERK1/2 kinases, respectively.BNN27 reversed the STZ-induced attenuation of the immunoreactive brain nitric oxide synthetase (bNOS)- and  hydroxylase (TH)-expressing amacrine cells and neurofilament (NFL)-expressing ganglion cell axons in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, BNN27 activated/phosphorylated the TrkA receptor and its downstream prosurvival signaling pathway, ERK1/2 kinases.The results of this study provide solid evidence regarding the efficacy of BNN27 as a neuroprotectant to the diabetic retina when administered topically, and suggest that its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles render it a putative therapeutic for diabetic retinopathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301539>Boswellic extracts and 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids prevent type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus by suppressing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.</a></h2><p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease directed to the pancreatic islets where  leads to the death of insulin-producing ß cells and insulin deficiency. Type 2 diabetes, which is closely related to overweight, is characterized by insulin resistance. In both cases, proinflammatory cytokines play an important role by causing insulitis and insulin resistance. The gum resin of Boswellia species and its pharmacologically active compounds, including 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids have been shown to suppress the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in various immune-competent cells.To review the present evidence of the therapeutic effects of boswellic extracts (BE) and/or 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids in the prevention/treatment of diabetes mellitus and to provide comprehensive insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms.This review considers all available informations from preclinical and clinical studies concerning BEs, 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids, proinflammatory cytokines and diabetes mellitus collected via electronic search (PubMed) and related publications of the author.Type 1 diabetes: Studies in mice with autoimmune diabetes revealed that in the model of multiple injections of low doses of streptozotocin (MLD-STZ), an extract of the gum resin of Boswellia serrata and 11-keto-ß-boswellic acid (KBA) suppressed the increase in proinflammatory cytokines in the blood, infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and increase in blood glucose. In a second model, i.e. the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, KBA prevented the infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets. Regarding the clinical effects, a case report provided evidence that BE suppressed the blood levels of  phosphatase antibody (IA-A), a marker for insulitis, in a patient with late-onset autoimmune diabetes of the adult (LADA). Type 2 diabetes: In a preclinical study in rats where obesity was alimentary induced, the administration of BE significantly reduced food intake, overweight, proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and ameliorated the parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism. Similar results were obtained in a second animal study, where type 2 diabetes was induced by a combination of a high-fat/high-fructose diet and a single dose of streptozotocin. Two clinical trials with patients with type 2 diabetes receiving the resin of Boswellia serrata demonstrated improvement in the blood glucose, HbA and lipid parameters.Preclinical and clinical data suggest that BE and/or 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids by inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines from immune-competent cells, may prevent insulitis and insulin resistance in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively, and therefore may be an option in the treatment/prevention of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It is hypothesized that molecularly, BE and 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids act via interference with the IκB kinase/Nuclear Transcription Factor-κB (IKK/NF-κB) signaling pathway through inhibition of the phosphorylation activity of IKK. However, further investigations and well-designed clinical studies are required.Copyright © 2019 The Author. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Acute colitis in PTPN2xVilCre mice was induced by 2% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for 7 days.

In the tumor model,  mRNA was again clearly upregulated in nontumor tissue from PTPN2-deficient mice; however, this was not observed in tumor tissue.Our experiments show that PTPN23 function might, at least partially, compensate lack of PTPN2 in epithelial cells. Upregulation of PTPN23 might therefore crucially contribute to the lack of a colitis phenotype in PTPN2-VilCre mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042082>Organic dust induces inflammatory gene expression in lung epithelial cells via ROS-dependent STAT-3 activation.</a></h2><p>Exposure to dust in agricultural and animal environments, known as organic dust, is associated with the development of respiratory symptoms and respiratory diseases.  is a key feature of lung pathologies associated with organic dust exposure, and exposure to organic dust induces the expression of several immune and inflammatory mediators. However, information on transcription factors and cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling the production of immune and inflammatory mediators induced by organic dust is limited. In this study, we have identified STAT-3 as an important transcription factor controlling the induction of expression of immune and inflammatory mediators by poultry dust extracts in airway epithelial cells and in mouse lungs and delineated the cellular pathway for STAT-3 activation. Poultry dust extract activated STAT-3 phosphorylation in Beas2B and normal human bronchial epithelial cells and in mouse lungs. Chemical inhibition and siRNA knockdown of STAT-3 suppressed induction of immune and inflammatory mediator expression. Antioxidants suppressed the increase of STAT-3 phosphorylation induced by poultry dust extract indicating that oxidative stress [elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels] is important for the activation. Chemical inhibition and siRNA knockdown experiments demonstrated that STAT-3 activation is dependent on the activation of nonreceptor -protein kinase 2 (TYK2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)  kinases. Our studies show that poultry dust extract controls the induction of immune and inflammatory mediator expression via a cellular pathway involving oxidative stress-mediated STAT-3 activation by TYK2 and EGFR  kinases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31441580>Soluble fms-like  kinase-1-enriched exosomes suppress the growth of small cell lung cancer by inhibiting endothelial cell migration.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have reported that soluble fms-like  kinase-1 (sFlt-1) possesses anti-tumor effects by inhibiting angiogenesis in many cancers. Exosomes can be engineered as delivery vehicles for transferring functional biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (DNA, mRNA, and miRNA) to target cells to affect , apoptosis, and angiogenesis. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether exosomes can function as efficient carriers of sFlt-1 in vitro and in vivo, to play a role in SCLC therapy.We adopted three different methods: TEM, NTA and western blot analysis to characterize the cell-derived exosomes from NCI-H69 SCLC cell line and normal bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cell line. we next explored the effects of these exosomes on HUVE cell proliferation and migration in vitro.To verify sFlt-1-loaded exosomes suppress the tumor growth in vivo,we established subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice using the NCI-H69 cell line.We observed that NCI-H69-exo significantly increased human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) migration compared to BEAS-2B-exo in vitro and in vivo. sFlt-1 protein expression was statistically higher in BEAS-2B-exo than NCI-H69-exo. sFlt-1 protein or sFlt-1-enriched exosomes can inhibit the migration of HUVECs. Furthermore, sFlt-1-enriched exosomes exhibited higher inhibition efficacy on pro-angiogenesis of NCI-H69-exo in comparison with the same concentration of sFlt-1 protein. Intriguingly, sFlt-1-loaded exosomes showed marked anti-tumor activity by inhibiting the growth of NCI-H69 tumor xenografts. CD31 staining revealed that sFlt-1-loaded exosomes significantly reduced the vascular density of experimental mice. sFlt-1-loaded exosomes markedly induced tumor apoptosis and inhibited tumor cell proliferation in mice.Exosomes from a SCLC cell line contain low levels of sFlt-1 and significantly increased the migration of HUVECs.

However, most patients eventually develop resistance. With the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death receptor/ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1), there is a growing interest in developing combination strategies. However, there are concerns that the combination of a PD-(L)1 inhibitor and EGFR-TKI may be associated with an increased risk of pneumonitis. Therefore, we utilized an established EGFR-driven tumor-bearing mouse model to investigate whether the combination would induce pneumonitis in mouse lung tissue.Mice were treated with monotherapy or combined therapy of PD-L1 antibody and EGFR-TKIs including first-generation gefitinib and third-generation osimertinib. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) and lung tissues were collected for analysis at the end of treatment.The osimertinib and anti-PD-L1 combined treatment group had the highest  scores in pathologic grades of H&E staining of lung tissue and had the highest percentages of myeloperoxidase positive cells. However, combining gefitinib and anti-PD-L1 treatment appeared to not increase the level of pneumonitis in mice. Total cell counts, neutrophil counts and total protein concentration in BALFs were also significantly increased in the osimertinib and anti-PD-L1 combined treatment group. We next evaluated proinflammatory factors in BALFs. The levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-5, TNF-α and IL-12p70 were increased in osimertinib and anti-PD-L1 combined treatment group. Comparison of different sequences of drug administration demonstrated that mice treated with osimertinib followed by PD-L1 antibody did not show evident lung . Our findings indicate that osimertinib, rather than gefitinib combined with anti-PD-L1 treatment could lead to lung injury in an EGFR mutated tumor-bearing mouse model. The sequence and timing of combining EGFR-TKI and PD-L1 antibody may influence the severity of pneumonitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Acne vulgaris is an exceptionally common skin condition, characterized by elevated sebum production, altered sebum composition, and the formation of infundibular cysts, called comedones. Comedo-associated SGs are atrophic, suggesting that comedo formation involves abnormal differentiation of progenitor cells that generate the SG and infundibulum: the 'comedo switch'. Understanding the biological processes that govern SG homeostasis promises to highlight potential aetiological mechanisms underlying acne and other SG-associated skin disorders.In this review, we discuss the clinical data, genetic mouse models and in vitro research that have highlighted major hormones, paracrine factors, transcription factors and signalling pathways that control SG homeostasis. These include, but are not limited to androgens, progestogens and oestrogens; retinoids; receptor  kinases such as ErbB family receptors, fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 and insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; aryl hydrocarbon receptor; and the Wnt signalling pathway. Where possible, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which these regulatory factors control SG biology are indicated, along with considerations as to how they might contribute to acne pathogenesis.Future research should seek to establish the relative importance, and causative relationships, of altered sebum production, sebum composition,  and abnormal differentiation of sebaceous progenitors to the process of comedo formation in acne. Such an understanding will allow for therapeutic targeting of regulatory factors that control SG homeostasis, with the aim of treating acne.© 2019 British Association of Dermatologists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298290>Monosodium urate crystal interleukin-1β release is dependent on Toll-like receptor 4 and transient receptor potential V1 activation.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms involved in MSU-induced IL-1β release in a rodent animal model of acute gout arthritis.Painful (mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity, ongoing pain and arthritis score) and inflammatory (oedema, plasma extravasation, cell infiltration and IL-1β release) parameters were assessed several hours after intra-articular injection of MSU (100 µg/articulation) in wild-type or knockout mice for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), transient receptor potential (TRP) V1 and the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R). Also, wild-type animals were treated with clodronate, lipopolysaccharide from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (LPS-RS) (TLR4 antagonist), spleen  kinase (SYK) inhibitor (iSYK), aminoguanidine (AMG, an iNOS inhibitor) or SB366791 (TRPV1 antagonist). Nitrite/nitrate and IL-1β levels were measured on the synovial fluid of wild-type mice, 2 h after intra-articular MSU injections, or medium from macrophages stimulated for MSU (1000 μg) for 2 h.Intra-articular MSU injection caused robust nociception and severe  from 2 up to 6 h after injection, which were prevented by the pre-treatment with clodronate, LPS-RS, iSYK, AMG and SB366791, or the genetic ablation of TLR4, iNOS, TRPV1 or IL-1R. MSU also increased nitrite/nitrate and IL-1β levels in the synovial fluid, which was prevented by clodronate, LPS-RS, iSYK and AMG, but not by SB366791.

Secreted factors, intercellular transfer of mitochondria and the receptor-ligand interactions have been shown as mediators of this protection. Here we report that tunneling nanotubes (TNTs)-long, thin membranous structures, which have been identified as a novel mode of intercellular cross-talk-are formed in the presence of stroma and mediate transfer of cellular vesicles from stroma to leukemic cells. Importantly, transmission of vesicles via TNTs from stromal cells increases resistance of leukemic cells to the  kinase inhibitor, imatinib. Using correlative light-electron microscopy and electron tomography we show that stromal TNTs contain vesicles, provide membrane continuity with the cell bodies and can be open-ended. Moreover, trans-SILAC studies to reveal the non-autonomous proteome showed that specific sets of proteins are transferred together with cellular vesicles from stromal to leukemic cells, with a potential role in survival and adaptation.

They trigger infiltration of neutrophils that exacerbate blood-retina barrier damage, regulate postischemic  and irreversible loss of neuroretina. Suppression of microglia-mediated  might bear potential for mitigating functional impairment after retinal vein occlusion (RVO). To test this hypothesis, we depleted microglia by PLX5622 (a selective  kinase inhibitor that targets the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor) in fractalkine receptor reporter mice (Cx3cr1 ) subjected to various regimens of PLX5622 treatment and experimental RVO. Effectiveness of microglia suppression and retinal outcomes including retinal thickness as well as ganglion cell survival were compared to a control group of mice with experimental vein occlusion only. PLX5622 caused dramatic suppression of microglia. Despite vein occlusion, reappearance of green fluorescent protein positive cells was strongly impeded with continuous PLX5622 treatment and significantly delayed after its cessation. In depleted mice, retinal proinflammatory cytokine signaling was diminished and retinal ganglion cell survival improved by almost 50% compared to nondepleted animals 3 weeks after vein occlusion. Optical coherence tomography suggested delayed retinal degeneration in depleted mice. In summary, findings indicate that suppression of cells bearing the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor, mainly microglia and monocytes, mitigates ischemic damage and salvages retinal ganglion cells. Blood-retina barrier breakdown seems central in the disease mechanism, and complex interactions between different cell types composing the blood-retina barrier as well as sustained hypoxia might explain why the protective effect was only partial.© 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, we investigated the potential role of SHP2 in eosinophil recruitment into lungs in allergic airway  and explored the underlying mechanism. Both SHP2 and Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) kinase were robustly activated in the airway eosinophils of children with allergic asthma and of a mouse model with allergic airway . Moreover, inhibition of SHP2 activity by its specific inhibitors reverses the dephosphorylation of p190-A Rho GTPase-activating protein and in turn attenuates RhoA/Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) signaling, resulting in the attenuation of eosinophil migration in response to platelet-activating factor stimulation. Specifically,  deletion in myeloid cells did not affect the number and classification of circulating leukocytes but significantly attenuated the allergen-induced inflammatory cell, especially eosinophil, infiltration into lungs, and airway hyperreactivity. Notably, genetic interaction between  and  indicated that RhoA inactivation and  deletion synergistically attenuated the allergen-induced eosinophil infiltration into lungs and airway hyperreactivity, whereas overexpression of active RhoA robustly restored the  deletion-resultant attenuation of allergen-induced eosinophil recruitment into lungs and airway hyperreactivity as well. Thus, this study demonstrates that SHP2  RhoA/ROCK signaling regulates eosinophil recruitment in allergic airway  and possibly in allergic asthma.-Xu, C., Wu, X., Lu, M., Tang, L., Yao, H., Wang, J., Ji, X., Hussain, M., Wu, J., Wu, X.

Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1, an amplifier of the innate immune response, is a critical regulator of . This study identified that microglial TREM-1 expression was upregulated following cerebral ischemic injury. After pharmacologic inhibition of TREM-1 with synthetic peptide LP17, ischemia-induced infarction and neuronal injury were substantially alleviated. Moreover, blockade of TREM-1 can potentiate cellular proliferation and synaptic plasticity in hippocampus, resulting in long-term functional improvement. Microglial M1 polarization and neutrophil recruitment were remarkably abrogated as mRNA levels of M1 markers, chemokines, and protein levels of myeloperoxidase and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were decreased by LP17. Mechanistically, both in vivo and in vitro, we delineated that TREM-1 can activate downstream pro-inflammatory pathways, CARD9/NF-κB, and NLRP3/caspase-1, through interacting with spleen  kinase (SYK). In addition, TREM-1-induced SYK initiation was responsible for microglial pyroptosis by elevating levels of gasdermin D (GSDMD), N-terminal fragment of GSDMD (GSDMD-N), and forming GSDMD pores, which can facilitate the release of intracellular inflammatory factors, in microglia. In summary, microglial TREM-1 receptor yielded post-stroke neuroinflammatory damage via associating with SYK.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31193976>Evaluation on monoamine neurotransmitters changes in depression rats given with sertraline, meloxicam or/and caffeic acid.</a></h2><p> drives the development of depression and may affect neurotransmitters and thus neurocircuits increase the risk of depression. To investigate the influence of inhibition of inflammatory pathways on the biogenic amine neurotransmitters metabolism in depressive rats, sertraline, and meloxicam, the inhibitors of arachidonic acid - cyclooxygenase-2/lipoxygenase (AA-COX-2/5-LO) pathways, were given to depressive rats. After the development of depression model by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 6 weeks, Successful modeling rats were selected and randomly divided into CUMS group and medication administration group. After given medicine, The biogenic amine neurotransmitters in rat cortex and hippocampus were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with an electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD). Compared with the normal group, the concentration of norepinephrine (NE) significantly decreased and the concentrations of  (Tyr), Tryptophan (Trp), 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid (DOPAC), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) significantly increased in the CUMS group. Sertraline significantly inhibited the elevation of 5-HIAA. Meloxicam inhibited the decrease of NE level in CUMS-induced rat and the increase of Trp, MHPG, and 5-HIAA level in a dose-dependent manner. Caffeic acid inhibited the decrease of NE and the increase of Trp and MHPG in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition of AA-COX-2/5-LO pathways can improve the behaviors of depression rats and suppress CUMS-induced changes in biogenic amines.

The most affected organs are the liver, kidney, heart and the gastrointestinal-immune system. In comparison to the other organs, less progress has been made on human-relevant prediction of drug-induced intestinal toxicity, evidencing current large data gaps. The most widely used drugs that are associated with intestinal damage include chemotherapeutics, such as 5-Fluorouracil or  Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs), as well as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Chemotherapeutics are regarded as inducers of acute intestinal toxicity whereas NSAIDs are associated with chronic  of the intestine. In view of the fact that only a few studies have been dedicated to studying cellular and genomic responses in relation to drug-induced intestinal ADRs, little is known about how intestinal toxicity develops after exposure to such drugs or which molecular mechanisms are involved. Therefore, new models and experiments are required to establish transcriptomic responses and alterations of molecular markers induced by different medicines. This review summarizes the available information about transcriptomic responses and biomarkers of toxicity induced by 5-FU, NSAIDS or TKIs in different experimental models. Future investigation should address the challenges in predicting intestinal toxicity induced by drugs and unveil specific gene expression profiles that can be applied in the development of safer drugs.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

MerTK is mainly expressed in anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages where it mediates transcriptional changes including suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancement of inflammatory repressors. MerTK is regulated by metabolic pathways through nuclear sensors including LXRs, PPARs, and RXRs, in response to apoptotic bodies or to other sources of cholesterol. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. It is a clinicopathological syndrome closely related to obesity, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. It includes a spectrum of conditions ranging from simple steatosis, characterized by hepatic fat accumulation with or without , to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), defined by hepatic fat deposition with hepatocellular damage, , and accumulating fibrosis. Several studies support an association between NAFLD and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, a major cause of death worldwide. This pathological condition consists in a chronic and progressive inflammatory process in the intimal layer of large- and medium-sized arteries. The complications of advanced atherosclerosis include chronic or acute ischemic damage in the tissue perfused by the affected artery, leading to cellular death. By identifying specific targets influencing lipid metabolism and cardiovascular-related diseases, the present review highlights the role of MerTK in NAFLD-associated atherosclerotic lesions as a potential innovative therapeutic target. Therapeutic advantages might derive from the use of compounds selective for nuclear receptors targeting PPARs rather than LXRs regulating macrophage lipid metabolism and macrophage mediated , by favoring the expression of MerTK, which mediates an immunoregulatory action with a reduction in  and in atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504252>Endothelial microvesicles carrying Src-rich cargo impair adherens junction integrity and cytoskeleton homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Microvesicles (MVs) conduct intercellular communication and impact diverse biological processes by transferring bioactive cargos to other cells. We investigated whether and how endothelial production of MVs contribute to vascular dysfunction during .We measured the levels and molecular properties of endothelial-derived MVs (EC-MVs) from mouse plasma following a septic injury elicited by cecal ligation and puncture, as well as those from supernatants of cultured endothelial cells stimulated by inflammatory agents including cytokines, thrombin, and complement 5a. The mouse studies showed that sepsis caused a significant increase in total plasma vesicles and VE-cadherin+ EC-MVs compared to sham control. In cultured ECs, different inflammatory agents caused diverse patterns of EC-MV production and cargo contents. When topically applied to endothelial cells, EC-MVs induced a cytoskeleton-junction response characterized by myosin light chain phosphorylation, contractile fiber reorganization, VE-cadherin phosphorylation and adherens junction dissociation, functionally measured as increased albumin transendothelial flux and decreased barrier resistance. The endothelial response was coupled with protein  phosphorylation promoted by MV cargo containing c-Src kinase, whereas MVs produced from c-Src deficient cells did not exert barrier-disrupting effects. Additionally, EC-MVs contribute to endothelial inflammatory injury by promoting neutrophil-endothelium adhesion and release of neutrophil extracellular traps containing citrullinated histones and myeloperoxidase, a response unaltered by c-Src knockdown.Endothelial-derived microparticles cause endothelial barrier dysfunction by impairing adherens junctions and activating neutrophils. The signaling mechanisms underlying the endothelial cytoskeleton-junction response to EC-MVs involve protein phosphorylation promoted by MV cargo carrying c-Src. However, EC-MV induced neutrophil activation was not dependent on c-Src.Circulating microvesicles derived from blood/vascular cells not only serve as serological markers of disease, but also play a pathogenic role in vascular . In this study, we characterized the production and molecular signature of microparticles produced by endothelial cells under inflammatory conditions. We discovered that these vesicles carry Src-bearing cargo which interact with endothelial cells inducing cytoskeleton contractile stress and impaired VE-cadherin junction integrity. Additionally, endothelial-derived MVs are capable of stimulating neutrophil-endothelium adhesion and production of neutrophil extracellular traps containing citrullinated histones and myeloperoxidase. These novel findings have the potential to be translated into the development of diagnostic or therapeutic strategies to treat inflammatory disease.© The Author(s) 2019.

There is still no cure for RA, and current therapeutics, including methotrexate and adalimumab, cause serious off-target effects and systemic immunosuppression, which in turn increases the risk of infection. Bruton's  kinase (BTK) in macrophages and B cells has been demonstrated to be a promising therapeutic target for RA. However, high doses of BTK inhibitors are required for efficient BTK suppression, which limits their clinical use. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is promising for the silencing of specific genes and has been used for the treatment of multiple diseases. To deliver siRNA into macrophages and B cells for BTK gene silencing, we employed cationic lipid-assisted PEG-b-PLGA nanoparticles (CLANs) to encapsulate siRNA. We demonstrated that macrophages and B cells were able to efficiently ingest the CLANs both in vitro and in vivo. Thereafter, we encapsulated siRNA targeting BTK (siBTK) into the CLANs, denoted as CLAN, and demonstrated that CLAN significantly inhibited BTK expression in macrophages and B cells. In a collagen-induced mouse arthritis model, CLAN treatment dramatically reduced joint  and other RA symptoms but showed no toxicity, proving that using CLAN is a promising approach for RA therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31173158>Classical dendritic cells regulate acute lung  and injury in mice with lipopolysaccharide‑induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.</a></h2><p>Classical dendritic cells (cDCs) are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung diseases; however, their contributions in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is pathophysiologically inflammatory, remain unknown. The present study aimed to explore the regulatory effects of pulmonary cDCs on acute lung  and injury in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑induced ARDS. Fms‑like  kinase 3‑ligand (FLT3L) and lestaurtinib, a specific activator and an inhibitor of FLT3 signaling respectively, were used separately for the pretreatment of C57BL/6 mice for 5 consecutive days. ARDS was induced by intratracheal injection of LPS, and mice were sacrificed 6 and 24 h later. Flow cytometry was used to measure the aggregation and maturation of pulmonary cDCs. The ratio of lung wet weight to body weight (LWW/BW) and histopathological analyses were assessed to evaluate lung edema and lung injury. Tumor necrosis factor‑α and interleukin (IL)‑6 levels were measured by ELISA to evaluate acute lung . The levels of interferon‑γ, IL‑1β, IL‑4 and IL‑10, and the expression of the transcription factors T‑box‑expressed‑in‑T‑cells (T‑bet) and GATA binding protein 3, were quantified by ELISA, RT‑qPCR and western blotting to evaluate the balance of the Th1/Th2 response. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was measured to evaluate neutrophil infiltration. The results demonstrated that the aggregation and maturation of pulmonary cDCs reached a peak at 6 h after LPS challenge, followed by a significant decrease at 24 h. FLT3L pretreatment further stimulated the aggregation and maturation of pulmonary cDCs, resulting in elevated lung MPO activity and increased T‑bet expression, which in turn led to aggravated LWW/BW, acute lung  and injury. However, lestaurtinib pretreatment inhibited the aggregation and maturation of pulmonary cDCs, decreased lung MPO activity and T‑bet expression, and eventually improved LWW/BW, acute lung  and injury. The present results suggested that pulmonary cDCs regulated acute lung  and injury in LPS‑induced ARDS through the modulation of neutrophil infiltration and balance of the Th1/Th2 response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181457>Analysis of protein chlorination by mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Chlorination of  is a commonly known effect/consequence of myeloperoxidase activity at sites of , and detection of 3-chlorotyrosine has been used as biomarker for inflammatory diseases.

In this study, we present an optimized mass spectrometry based protocol to identify and quantify chlorinated peptides from single proteins modified by HOCl (100 and 500 μM, within estimated pathophysiological levels), at a high level of sensitivity and accuracy. Particular emphasis was placed on 1) sensitive and precise detection of modification sites, 2) the avoidance of loss or artefactual creation of modifications, 3) accurate quantification of peptide abundance and reduction of missing values problem, 4) monitoring the dynamics of modification in samples exposed to different oxidant concentrations and 5) development of guidelines for verification of chlorination sites assignment. A combination of an optimised sample preparation protocol, and improved data analysis approaches have allowed identification of 33 and 15 chlorination sites in laminin and fibronectin, respectively, reported in previous manuscripts [1,2].

Apelin-13, a predominant neuropeptide with inhibiting effect on , has beneficial effects on cognition memory and neuronal damage. However, whether apelin-13 can protect neurons to ameliorate cognitive deficits in AD by inhibiting the inflammatory response remains largely unknown. To test this hypothesis, rats were intracerebroventricularly (ICV) injected with streptozotocin (3 mg/kg) alone or in combination with apelin-13 (2 μg). And  receptor kinase B (TrkB) blocker K252a (200 nM) was administrated 10 min before apelin injection. Furthermore, cognitive performance was assessed by new object recognition (NOR) and Y-maze tests. Protein expression of apelin, APJ, microglial marker (IBA1), astroglia marker (GFAP), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), synaptophysin (SYP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), TrkB, phospho-TrkB (p-TrkB) in the hippocampus were examined by western blotting or immunohistochemistry. And the gene expression of IBA1, GFAP, IL-1β, TNF-α, and SYP were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Inflammatory disorder in the hippocampus was tested by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to study the expression level of acetylcholine. And the activity of acetylcholinesterase was detected by Acetylcholinesterase Assay Kit. We observed that apelin/APJ signaling was downregulated in the hippocampus of rats administrated with STZ. Apelin-13 was found to significantly ameliorate STZ-induced AD-like phenotypes including congnitive deficit, cholinergic disfunction and the damage of neuron and synaptic plasticity. Moreover, apelin-13 inhibited microglia and astrocyte activation, reduced IL-1β and TNF-α expression and hippocampal BDNF/TrkB expression deficit in AD rats.

In the present study, DM was induced by single I.P. injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (50 mg/kg). Daily oral nilotinib (10 mg/kg) and (20 mg/kg) for 4 weeks induced a significant attenuation of DM signs in rats and their assessed lab values. Nilotinib induced a dose-dependent significant escalation in serum insulin level with a significant reduction in blood glucose and glucagon levels. Nevertheless, biomarkers of cell injury, tissue necrosis, and apoptosis; caspase-3 were significantly reduced. Moreover, pancreatic antioxidants defenses of which; thioredoxin, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities, reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration, and total antioxidant capacity significantly improved with a simultaneous reduction in malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Histopathologically, nilotinib treatment was associated with a minimal pancreatic injury with a significant restoration of insulin content in β-islets. In addition, nilotinib treatment revealed a significant reduction in infiltration of macrophages in β-cells. In conclusion: nilotinib's ameliorative impact on DM may be attributed to both nilotinib's mediated protection and preservation of pancreatic β islets function and the improvement in serum insulin levels and hence the improvement of blood glucose.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, newly weaned (3 week) and adult (8 week) male rats fed a normal- or high- fat diet were chronically exposed to 0.3 mg chlorpyrifos/kg bodyweight/day. The effects of chlorpyrifos exposure on serum hormone levels, proinflammatory cytokines and gut microbiota were evaluated. Chronic exposure to chlorpyrifos significantly decreased the concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicule stimulating hormone and testosterone, which was found only in the normal-fat diet. The counteracted effect of high-fat diet was also found in gut hormones and proinflammatory cytokines. Significantly higher concentrations of glucagon-like peptide-1, pancreatic polypeptide, peptide   (PYY), ghrelin, gastric inhibitory poly-peptide, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and TNF-α were found in rats exposed to chlorpyrifos beginning at newly weaned, whereas only the PYY, ghrelin and IL-6 concentrations increased significantly in rats exposed in adulthood. Furthermore, a decrease in epinephrine induced by chlorpyrifos exposure was found in rats exposed to chlorpyrifos beginning at newly weaned, regardless of their diet. Chlorpyrifos-induced disturbances in the microbiome community structure were more apparent in rats fed a high-fat diet and exposed beginning at newly weaned. The affected bacteria included short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria (Romboutsia, Turicibacter, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, norank_f_Coriobacteriaceae, Faecalibaculum, Parasutterella and norank_f__Erysipelotrichaceae), testosterone-related genus (Turicibacter, Brevibacterium), pathogenic bacteria (Streptococcus), and -related bacteria (unclassified_f__Ruminococcaceae, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-009, Parasutterella, Oscillibacter), which regulated the endocrine system via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, as well as the immune response and gut barrier.

These stimuli, also known as growth factors, are important molecular cues actively supporting cancer stem cell (CSC) self-renewal and viability. Since in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) the expression of c-Kit (CD117) has been identified as a CSC hallmark, we investigated the existence of a tumor growth-promoting loop between c-Kit and its ligand Stem Cell Factor (SCF). SCF exists as a soluble or transmembrane protein and through c-Kit interaction regulates cell viability, proliferation, and differentiation both in physiological and pathological conditions. High amounts of SCF were found in the ascitic effusions collected from EOC patients. While tumor cells and CSC only expressed the membrane-associated SCF isoform, both secreted and membrane-bound isoforms were expressed by tumor-associated macrophages (TAM, here shown to be M2-like) and fibroblasts (TAF). Circulating monocytes from EOC-bearing patients and healthy donors did not express both SCF isoforms. However, monocytes isolated from healthy donors produced SCF upon in vitro differentiation into macrophages, irrespectively of M1 or M2 polarization. In vitro, both SCF isoforms were able to activate the Akt pathway in c-Kit cells, and this effect was counteracted by the  kinase inhibitor imatinib. In addition, our results indicated that SCF could help c-Kit CSC survival in selective culture conditions and promote their canonical stemness properties, thus indicating the possible existence of a juxtacrine/paracrine circuit in EOC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31146915>N-Substituted amino acid inhibitors of the phosphatase domain of the soluble epoxide hydrolase.</a></h2><p>The soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a bifunctional enzyme implicated in the regulation of .

In this study, a novel MKK6, EcMKK6, was isolated from Epinephelus coioides, an economically important cultured fish in China and Southeast Asian counties. The open reading frame (ORF) of EcMKK6 is 1077 bp encoding 358 amino acids. EcMKK6 contains a serine/threonine protein kinase (S_TKc) domain, a  kinase catalytic domain, a conserved dual phosphorylation site in the SVAKT motif and a conserved DVD domain. By in situ hybridization (ISH) with Digoxigenin-labeled probe, EcMKK6 mainly located at the cytoplasm of cells, and a little appears in the nucleus. EcMKK6 mRNA can be detected in all eleven tissues examined, but the expression level is different in these tissues. After challenge with Vibrio alginolyticus and Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV), the transcription level of EcMKK6 was apparently up-regulated in the tissues examined. The data demonstrated that the sequence and the characters of EcMKK6 were conserved, EcMKK6 showed tissue-specific expression profiles in healthy grouper, and the expression was significantly varied after pathogen infection, indicating that EcMKK6 may play important roles in E. coioides during pathogen-caused .Copyright © 2019.

We have employed an ectopic model of TREM2 and DAP12 expression in HEK293 cells to study selectively TREM2 dependent signaling and phagocytic functions and evaluated the effects of some of the TREM2 mutations associated with AD. We show that shedding of the TREM2 N-terminal domain does not affect the inhibition of NFκB activation induced by TREM2 while it completely blocks phagocytosis suggesting that TREM2 anti-inflammatory properties can be mediated by the TREM2 C-terminal fragment while the phagocytic activity requires the full-length receptor. In addition, we confirm in that model that apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a ligand for TREM2 and triggers TREM2 signaling. In particular, we show that APOE4 stimulates spleen  kinase (SYK) activation more potently than APOE2 in a TREM2 dependent manner. Interestingly, TREM2 appears to antagonize NFκB activation induced by phorbol ester but is unable to prevent TNFα induction of NFκB activation suggesting that TREM2 antagonizes inflammatory events triggered downstream of PKC. TREM2 mutations drastically impact TREM2 phagocytosis as well as its ability to antagonize NFκB activation and notably prevent the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway observed with wild-type TREM2. Overall our data suggest that TREM2 dependent phagocytosis requires an activation of the SYK/PI3K/AKT/PLCγ pathways while the suppression of NFκB activation by TREM2 is independent of SYK, PI3K, and PLCγ activities. This model of ectopic TREM2-DAP12 co-expression appears suitable to study TREM2 signaling as several biological functions of TREM2 and TREM2 mutations that have been previously described in myeloid and microglial cells were also replicated in this model.Copyright © 2019 Yao, Coppola, Schweig, Crawford, Mullan and Paris.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565241>Antibodies against citrullinated peptides are associated with clinical and radiological outcomes in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis: a prospective longitudinal inception cohort study.</a></h2><p>Anticitrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) responses for 22 citrullinated peptides in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were analysed and related to radiological and clinical outcome during the first 2 years in a prospective inception cohort.The ACPA reactivities were assessed in 1022 patients with early RA (symptoms <12 months) using the custom-made microarray chip (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden) in a prospective longitudinal study of observational assessments of Disease Activity Score (DAS28 and its components) and radiology during the first 24 months, accounting for the treatment.Frequency of ACPA reactivities varied between 13.3% and 63.1%. Of the anticyclic citrullinated peptide-2 (anti-CCP2) antibody-negative patients, ACPA reactivities were positive in 32.6%. Smoking, human leucocyte antigen-shared epitope (HLA-SE), anti-CCP2/rheumatoid factor, protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (1858C/T) and DAS28 were significantly associated with number of ACPA reactivities. The ACPA reactivities modified differently the development of DAS28 over 24 months (identified using trajectories). Anti-Filaggrin307-324, anti-hnRNP (Peptide)-Z1 and anti-F4-CIT-R antibodies anticipated lower DAS28 values (p<0.01-0.05), while positivity for anti-Fibrinogen(Fib)β62-78(74), and anti-Fibα563-583 predicted higher DAS28 (p<0.01 both). Interaction between anti-Fibß36-52, anti-Pept-5 and anti-Bla-26 antibodies, respectively, and DAS28 during 24 months decreased significantly the DAS28 values (p<0.01-0.05).

Indeed, previously we have reported that SYK also regulates β-amyloid (Aβ) production and hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein involved in these diseases. Moreover, SYK hyperactivation occurs in a subset of activated microglia, in dystrophic neurites surrounding Aβ deposits, and in neurons affected by Tau pathology both in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in AD mouse models. SYK activation increases Tau phosphorylation and accumulation, suggesting that SYK could be an attractive target for treating AD. However, the mechanism by which SYK affects Tau pathology is not clear. In this study, using cell biology and biochemical approaches, along with immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, quantitative RT-PCR, and ELISAs, we found that SYK inhibition increases autophagic Tau degradation without impacting Tau production. Using neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells, we demonstrate that SYK acts upstream of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and that pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of SYK decreases mTOR pathway activation and increases autophagic Tau degradation. Interestingly, chronic SYK inhibition in a tauopathy mouse model profoundly reduced Tau accumulation, neuroinflammation, neuronal and synaptic loss, and also reversed defective autophagy. Our results further suggest that the SYK up-regulation observed in the brains of individuals with AD contributes to defective autophagic clearance leading to the accumulation of pathogenic Tau species. These findings further highlight SYK as a therapeutic target for the treatment of tauopathies and other neurodegenerative proteinopathies associated with defective autophagic clearance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31198107>The Protective Effect of Korean Red Ginseng Against Rotenone-Induced Parkinson's Disease in Rat Model: Modulation of Nuclear Factor-κβ and Caspase-3.</a></h2><p>Korean red ginseng was reported to have many biological effects like the antioxidant and the anti-inflammatory activities. Oxidative stress and neuro- play major roles in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The current study aimed to investigate the protective effects of ginseng on rotenone-induced PD in rats.Rats were randomly allocated into 4 groups: normal rats, rotenone control, ginseng+rotenone and ginseng only treated rats. The severity of PD was evaluated through locomotor activity perceived in the open field test, histological examination and immunohistochemical detection of amyloid-β in brain tissues, in addition to the biochemical assessment of  hydroxylase activity in brain tissues. Moreover, the following parameters were investigated for studying the possible mechanisms of ginseng neuroprotective effect: nuclear factor-κβ (NF-κβ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), caspase- 3, lipid peroxides and reduced glutathione (GSH).Ginseng exhibited potent neuroprotective effect that was reflected upon the histopathological examination, marked improvement in the locomotor activity and through its ability to suppress the amyloid- β deposition in the cortex and striatum along with significant increase in the  hydroxylase activity. Ginseng successfully inhibited the NF-κβ inflammatory pathway in brain tissues beside the inhibition of other oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, it exhibited antiapoptotic effect via the inhibition of caspase-3 expression.Ginseng could be a promising treatment in PD. It can suppress dopaminergic neuron degeneration through variable mechanisms mainly via inhibition of NF-κβ pathway in addition to inhibition of oxidative stress and apoptosis.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042421>MicroRNA-140 inhibits skeletal muscle glycolysis and atrophy in endotoxin-induced sepsis in mice via the WNT signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome resulting from infection. This study aimed at exploring the role of microRNA-140 (miR-140) in septic mice. Wnt family member 11 (WNT11) was verified to be a target gene of miR-140 after bioinformatic prediction and dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Importantly, miR-140 negatively regulated WNT11. We initially induced the model of sepsis by endotoxin, and then ectopic expression and knockdown experiments were performed to explore the functional role of miR-140 in sepsis. Additionally, cross-sectional areas of muscle fiber, lactic acid production, 3-methylhistidine (3-MH) and  (Tyr) production in extensor digitorium longus (EDL) muscles, and serum levels of inflammatory factors were examined. The effect of miR-140 on the expression of WNT signaling pathway-related and apoptosis-related factors in skeletal muscle tissue was determined. The experimental results indicated that upregulated miR-140 or silenced WNT11 increased cross-sectional areas of muscle fiber while decreasing lactic acid production, skeletal muscle cell apoptosis [corresponding to downregulated B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax) and caspase-3 and upregulated Bcl-2], and the proteolytic rate of Tyr and 3-MH. Also, overexpressed miR-140 or silenced WNT11 reduced  as reflected by decreased serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-140 was shown to suppress the activation of the WNT signaling pathway, accompanied by decreased expression of WNT11, β-catenin, and GSK-3β. Taken together, upregulation of miR-140 could potentially inhibit skeletal muscle lactate release, an indirect measure of glycolysis, and atrophy in septic mice through suppressing the WNT signaling pathway via inhibiting WNT11 expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31084274>Exploitation of receptor  kinases by viral-encoded growth factors.</a></h2><p>Receptor  kinases (RTKs) are essential components of cell communication pathways utilized from the embryonic to adult stages of life.

However, little is known about its biological and pharmacological functions. The aim of this study was to investigate the novel functions of tubulosine in cancer treatment, specifically in breast cancer.An Unpaired (Upd)-induced Drosophila cell line and interleukin (IL)-6-stimulated human breast cancer cell lines were used to investigate the biological and pharmacological activities of tubulosine . To investigate the activities of tubulosine, we performed molecular and cellular experiments such as Western blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses, immunoprecipitation and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assays, and immunofluorescence staining using breast cancer cell lines.Tubulosine exhibited anticancer activity in IL-6-stimulated human breast cancer cells. Moreover, tubulosine reduced the  phosphorylation level and transcriptional activity of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein at 92E in Upd-induced Drosophila cells. Additionally, tubulosine suppressed IL-6-induced Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3 signaling, resulting in decreased viability and induction of apoptotic cell death in breast cancer cells. Interestingly, inhibition of IL-6-induced JAK2/STAT3 signaling by tubulosine was associated with the blocking of IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and glycoprotein 130 (gp130) binding.Tubulosine exhibits anticancer activity through functional inhibition of IL-6-induced JAK2/STAT3 signaling by targeting IL-6Rα/gp130 binding in breast cancer cells.

The study aim was to investigate the role of AXL inhibition in kidney fibrosis due to unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Eight weeks old male C57BL/6 mice underwent UUO and were treated with oral AXL inhibitor bemcentinib (n = 22), Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI, n = 10), ACEI and bemcentinib (n = 10) or vehicle alone (n = 22). Mice were sacrificed after 7 or 15 days and kidney tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blot, ELISA, Sirius Red (SR) staining, and hydroxyproline (Hyp) quantification. RNA was extracted from frozen kidney tissues and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq4000 platform. After 15 days the ligated bemcentinib-treated kidneys showed less fibrosis compared to the ligated vehicle-treated kidneys in SR analyses and Hyp quantification. Reduced IHC staining for Vimentin (VIM) and alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA), as well as reduced mRNA abundance of key regulators of fibrosis such as transforming growth factor (Tgfβ), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (Mmp2), Smad2, Smad4, myofibroblast activation (Aldh1a2, Crlf1), and EMT (Snai1,2, Twist), in ligated bemcentinib-treated kidneys was compatible with reduced (partial) EMT induction. Furthermore, less F4/80 positive cells, less activity of pathways related to the immune system and lower abundance of MCP1, MCP3, MCP5, and TARC in ligated bemcentinib-treated kidneys was compatible with reduction in inflammatory infiltrates by bemcentinib treatment. The AXL RTK pathway represents a promising target for pharmacologic therapy of kidney fibrosis.© 2019 The Authors.

The pathogenesis of DM is unclear, and identification of reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis of DM is critical for design of a specific therapy for this disease.To find and identify potential serum biomarkers in DM patients.We performed an untargeted metabolomic approach using UHPLC-MS/MS. The blood serum metabolomic profiles of 26 DM patients and 26 healthy controls were collected. Multivariate analysis of the metabolomic profile was applied to differentiate DM patients and controls and to find potential biomarkers.A significantly disturbed metabolic profile of DM patients was observed. Pathway analysis showed that aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis, and nitrogen metabolism are the most prominently altered pathways in DM. Receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that glutamine, methionine, isoleucine, tryptophan, glutamic acid, indole, protocatechuic acid, and phenylalanine were potential biomarkers for DM diagnosis in terms of both sensitivity and specificity.Our study provides new insight into underlying mechanisms of DM, and we suggest that we should pay more attention to these metabolic pathways in the prevention and treatment of DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31228452>New insight into systemic mastocytosis mediated by cytokines IL-1β and IL-33: Potential inhibitory effect of IL-37.</a></h2><p>Systemic mastocytosis in various forms is characterized by mast cell (MC) infiltration of the bone marrow and other internal organs. The most common form is the indolent one with life expectancy similar to the normal population, while the systemic aggressive myeloproliferative type presents serious damage to various organs and is associated with mature and immature atypical mast cells. In systemic mastocytosis patients, MCs could be activated with consequent severe anaphylactic reactions, along with other symptoms. MCs, which are reactive to a variety of external factors such as allergens or other inflammatory or physical stimuli, derive from pluripotent cellular progenitor CD34 which leaves the bone marrow as CD34/CD17 for implantation in the tissues where they reach maturation. MCs participate in the innate and adaptive immune system where they play a role in host defense. Activation of MCs occurs through the binding of IgE to FcεRI receptor, and initiates the phosphorylation and activation of the p38  MAP kinase. After various reactions there is a subsequent translation and generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines which are strongly linked to allergic  and mastocytosis. Human cytokine interleukin-37 (IL-37), a unique IL-1β family member, has strong protective and anti-inflammatory properties, influencing cellular metabolism. We investigated the effect of IL-37 on  in mastocytosis and report that the hematopoietic expression of IL-37 can reduce the inflammatory state in this disease. IL-37 limits excessive , which suggests that IL-37 may be beneficial to the metabolic and inflammatory process and is a candidate as a potential new therapeutic agent.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To date, Current PD drugs offers only symptomatic relief with adverse effects and lack of ability to prevent the progression of neurodegeneration. Therefore, a better approach to develop a multi potent drug of natural origin would be beneficial in managing the disease. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of PHL by exploring its neuroprotective mechanism in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro pyridine (MPTP) induced PD in mice. MPTP intoxication in mice cause motor abnormalities, decreased dopamine (DA) levels, reduced  hydroxylase (TH) enzyme protein expression and  which were effectively restored by PHL. Moreover gliotic specific inflammatory markers like glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ionized calcium-binding adaptor protein-1 (Iba-1), iNOS and COX-2 were found to be expressed more in MPTP intoxicated mice, Further the levels of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-β, IL-6, and TNF-α were significantly upregulated in MPTP intoxicated mice, these deleterious responses were diminished to extend neuroprotection by PHL treatment. Our findings strongly suggest PHL as a potent therapeutic agent in treating PD.Copyright © 2019.

IL-10-deficient mice and patients with mutations in IL-10 or its receptor, IL-10R, show increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Protein  phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) controls immune cell activation and the equilibrium between regulatory and effector T cells, playing an important role in controlling immune homoeostasis of the gut. Here, we examined the role of PTPN22 in intestinal  of IL-10-deficient (IL-10 ) mice. We crossed IL-10 mice with PTPN22 mice to generate PTPN22 IL-10 double knock-out mice and induced colitis with dextran sodium sulphate (DSS). In line with previous reports, DSS-induced acute and chronic colitis was exacerbated in IL-10 mice compared to wild-type (WT) controls. However, PTPN22 IL-10 double knock-out mice developed milder disease compared to IL-10 mice. IL-17-promoting innate cytokines and T helper type 17 (Th17) cells were markedly increased in PTPN22 IL-10 mice, but did not provide a protctive function. CXCL1/KC was also increased in PTPN22 IL-10 mice, but therapeutic injection of CXCL1/KC in IL-10 mice did not ameliorate colitis. These results show that PTPN22 promotes intestinal  in IL-10-deficient mice, suggesting that therapeutic targeting of PTPN22 might be beneficial in patients with IBD and mutations in IL-10 and IL-10R.© 2019 British Society for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585207>NADPH oxidase in the vasculature: Expression, regulation and signalling pathways; role in normal cardiovascular physiology and its dysregulation in hypertension.</a></h2><p>The last 20-25 years have seen an explosion of interest in the role of NADPH oxidase (NOX) in cardiovascular function and disease. In vascular smooth muscle and endothelium, NOX generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that act as second messengers, contributing to the control of normal vascular function. NOX activity is altered in response to a variety of stimuli, including G-protein coupled receptor agonists, growth-factors, perfusion pressure, flow and hypoxia. NOX-derived ROS are involved in smooth muscle constriction, endothelium-dependent relaxation and smooth muscle growth, proliferation and migration, thus contributing to the fine-tuning of blood flow, arterial wall thickness and vascular resistance. Through reversible oxidative modification of target proteins, ROS regulate the activity of protein  phosphatases, kinases, G proteins, ion channels, cytoskeletal proteins and transcription factors. There is now considerable, but somewhat contradictory evidence that NOX contributes to the pathogenesis of hypertension through oxidative stress. Specific NOX isoforms have been implicated in endothelial dysfunction, hyper-contractility and vascular remodelling in various animal models of hypertension, pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary arterial hypertension, but also have potential protective effects, particularly NOX4. This review explores the multiplicity of NOX function in the healthy vasculature and the evidence for and against targeting NOX for antihypertensive therapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In the rodent nerve injury model of neuropathic pain, BDNF-mediated loss of inhibition (disinhibition) gates the potentiation of excitatory GluN2B N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) responses at lamina I dorsal horn synapses. However, the centrality of this mechanism across pain states and species, as well as the molecular linker involved, remain unknown. Here, we show that KCC2-dependent disinhibition is coupled to increased GluN2B-mediated synaptic NMDAR responses in a rodent model of inflammatory pain, with an associated downregulation of the  phosphatase STEP61. The decreased activity of STEP61 is both necessary and sufficient to prime subsequent phosphorylation and potentiation of GluN2B NMDAR by BDNF at lamina I synapses. Blocking disinhibition reversed the downregulation of STEP61 as well as -mediated behavioural hypersensitivity. For the first time, we characterize GluN2B-mediated NMDAR responses at human lamina I synapses and show that a human ex vivo BDNF model of pathological pain processing downregulates KCC2 and STEP61 and upregulates phosphorylated GluN2B at dorsal horn synapses. Our results demonstrate that STEP61 is the molecular brake that is lost following KCC2-dependent disinhibition and that the decrease in STEP61 activity drives the potentiation of excitatory GluN2B NMDAR responses in rodent and human models of pathological pain. The ex vivo human BDNF model may thus form a translational bridge between rodents and humans for identification and validation of novel molecular pain targets.© The Author(s) (2019).

Zinc finger protein A20 (A20), an acute phase response gene, is a potent inhibitor of NF-κB signaling. A20 serves a critical role in liver protection, including limiting  following hepatic injury, stimulating hepatocyte growth, and preventing hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury.

We hypothesized that CD8 T-cells regulate the inflammatory response, leading to decreased survival and cardiac function post-MI. We performed permanent occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery on C57BL/6J and CD8a mice (deficient in functional CD8 T-cells). CD8a mice had increased survival at 7 days post-MI compared with that of the wild-type (WT) and improved cardiac physiology at  post-MI. Despite having less mortality, 100% of the CD8a group died because of cardiac rupture compared with only 33% of the WT. Picrosirius red staining and collagen immunoblotting indicated an acceleration of fibrosis in the infarct area as well as remote area in the CD8a mice; however, this increase was due to elevated soluble collagen implicating poor scar formation. Plasma and tissue  were exacerbated as indicated by higher levels of Cxcl1, Ccl11, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry indicated that the CD8a group had augmented numbers of neutrophils and macrophages at post-MI  and increased mast cell markers at post-MI . Cleavage of -protein kinase MER was increased in the CD8a mice, resulting in delayed removal of necrotic tissue. In conclusion, despite having improved cardiac physiology and overall survival, CD8a mice had increased innate  and poor scar formation, leading to higher incidence of cardiac rupture. Our data suggest that the role of CD8 T-cells in post-MI recovery may be both beneficial and detrimental to cardiac remodeling and is mediated via a cell-specific mechanism. We identified new mechanisms implicating CD8 T-cells as regulators of the post-myocardial infarction (MI) wound healing process. Mice without functional CD8 T-cells had improved cardiac physiology and less mortality 7 days post MI compared with wild-type animals. Despite having better overall survival, animals lacking functional CD8 T-cells had delayed removal of necrotic tissue, leading to poor scar formation and increased cardiac rupture, suggesting that CD8 T-cells play a dual role in the cardiac remodeling process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31113864>RIP2 promotes FcγR-mediated reactive oxygen species production.</a></h2><p>Receptor-interacting protein 2 (RIP2) is a kinase that mediates signaling downstream of the bacterial peptidoglycan sensors NOD1 and NOD2. Genetic loss or pharmaceutical inhibition of RIP2 has been shown to be beneficial in multiple inflammatory disease models with the effects largely attributed to reducing proinflammatory signaling downstream of peptidoglycan recognition. However, given the widespread expression of this kinase and its reported interactions with numerous other proteins, it is possible that RIP2 may also function in roles outside of peptidoglycan sensing. In this work, we show that RIP2 undergoes  phosphorylation and activation in response to engagement of the Fc γ receptor (FcγR). Using bone marrow-derived macrophages from WT and RIP2-KO mice, we show that loss of RIP2 leads to deficient FcγR signaling and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production upon FcγR cross-linking without affecting cytokine secretion, phagocytosis, or nitrate/nitrite production. The FcγR-induced ROS response was still dependent on NOD2, as macrophages deficient in this receptor showed similar defects. Mechanistically, we found that different members of the Src family kinases (SFKs) can promote RIP2  phosphorylation and activation. Altogether, our findings suggest that RIP2 is functionally important in pathways outside of bacterial peptidoglycan sensing and that involvement in such pathways may depend on the actions of SFKs. These findings will have important implications for future therapies designed to target this kinase.© 2019 Shehat et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145836>Physical proximity and functional cooperation of glycoprotein 130 and glycoprotein VI in platelet membrane lipid rafts.</a></h2><p>Clinical and laboratory studies have demonstrated that platelets become hyperactive and prothrombotic in conditions of . We have previously shown that the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 forms a complex with soluble IL-6 receptor α (sIL-6Rα) to prime platelets for activation by subthreshold concentrations of collagen. Upon being stimulated with collagen, the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 in platelets is phosphorylated and dimerized to act as a protein scaffold to facilitate the catalytic action between the kinase Syk and the substrate phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) in collagen-induced signaling. However, it remains unknown how collagen induces phosphorylation and dimerization of STAT3.We conducted complementary in vitro experiments to show that the IL-6 receptor subunit glycoprotein 130 (GP130) was in physical proximity to the collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI in membrane lipid rafts of platelets. This proximity allows collagen to induce STAT3 activation and dimerization, and the IL-6-sIL-6Rα complex to activate the kinase Syk and the substrate PLCγ2 in the GPVI signal pathway, resulting in an enhanced platelet response to collagen. Disrupting lipid rafts or blocking GP130-Janus  kinase (JAK)-STAT3 signaling abolished the cross-activation and reduced platelet reactivity to collagen.These results demonstrate cross-talk between collagen and IL-6 signal pathways. This cross-talk could potentially provide a novel mechanism for -induced platelet hyperactivity, so the IL-6-GP130-JAK-STAT3 pathway has been identified as a potential target to block this hyperactivity.© 2019 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31319129>The activation of immunoglobulin G Fc receptors (FcγRs) with immunoreceptor -based activation motifs (ITAMs) promotes cognitive impairment in aged rats with diabetes.</a></h2><p>Although immunoglobulin G Fc receptors with immunoreceptor -based activation motifs (ITAM-FcγRs) have been implicated in the mediation of inflammatory responses, the importance of these receptors in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in geriatric diabetes remains unclear. The present study investigated the potential role of ITAM-FcγRs in cognitive impairment in geriatric diabetes.Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ) in aged Wistar rats, and cognitive function and cerebral injury were assessed 8 weeks later using the Morris water maze (MWM), real-time PCR and Western blot. In vitro, the inhibition of ITAM-FcγRs was investigated using rat chromaffin cells cultured with high glucose.Aged rats with diabetes exhibited marked and persistent learning and memory impairments. Enhanced cerebral  in the diabetic aged rats was associated with the overactivation of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway and the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor nuclear factor-α (TNF-α)) in the hippocampus. Compared to no treatment, the knockdown of FcγRIV (the main isoform of ITAM-FcγRs) markedly attenuated cognitive impairment as well as histologic and ultrastructural pathologic changes in the diabetic rats. The increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and the overactivation of the NF-κB signaling pathway were also significantly alleviated. In vitro, high glucose concentrations significantly activated the NF-κB signaling pathway and increased the expression of inflammatory cytokines. The inhibition of FcγR expression by a small interfering RNA and/or a FcγRI- and FcγRIII-neutralizing antibody significantly ameliorated the effects mediated by high glucose.The enhanced activation of the NF-κB signalling pathway may be the mechanism by which ITAM-FcγRs promote cerebral  and cognitive impairment in diabetes. ITAM-FcγRs may be viewed as a potential target for preventative intervention for cognitive impairment in older adults with diabetes.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here we define that sensing of apoptotic cells by the TAM receptor  kinase Axl is a critical indicator for tracheal basal cell expansion, cell cycle reentry, and symmetrical cell division. Furthermore, once the pool of tracheal basal cells has expanded, silencing of Axl is required for their differentiation. Genetic depletion of Axl triggers asymmetrical cell division, leading to epithelial differentiation and ciliated cell regeneration. This discovery has implications for conditions associated with epithelial barrier dysfunction, basal cell hyperplasia, and continued turnover of dying cells in patients with chronic inflammatory pulmonary diseases.© 2019 Fujino et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31230815>TAM Kinases Promote Necroptosis by Regulating Oligomerization of MLKL.</a></h2><p>Necroptosis, a cell death pathway mediated by the RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL signaling cascade downstream of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), has been implicated in many inflammatory diseases. Members of the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, and Mer) family of receptor  kinases are known for their anti-apoptotic, oncogenic, and anti-inflammatory roles. Here, we identify an unexpected role of TAM kinases as promoters of necroptosis, a pro-inflammatory necrotic cell death. Pharmacologic or genetic targeting of TAM kinases results in a potent inhibition of necroptotic death in various cellular models. We identify phosphorylation of MLKL Tyr376 as a direct point of input from TAM kinases into the necroptosis signaling. The oligomerization of MLKL, but not its membranal translocation or phosphorylation by RIPK3, is controlled by TAM kinases. Importantly, both knockout and inhibition of TAM kinases protect mice from systemic inflammatory response syndrome. In conclusion, this study discovers that immunosuppressant TAM kinases are promoters of pro-inflammatory necroptosis, shedding light on the biological complexity of the regulation of .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the identity of responsible PTK(s) in cytokine signaling have not been elucidated. To evaluate which PTK is critical to promote the cytokine-induced inflammatory cell adhesion molecule (CAM) expression including VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin in human aortic endothelial cells (HAoECs), we have tested pharmacological inhibitors of major PTKs: Src and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) family kinases - FAK and proline-rich  kinase (Pyk2). We found that a dual inhibitor of FAK/Pyk2 (PF-271) most effectively reduced all three CAMs upon TNF-α or IL-1β stimulation compared to FAK or Src specific inhibitors (PF-228 or Dasatinib), which inhibited only VCAM-1 expression. In vitro  assays showed PF-271 reduced monocyte attachment and transmigration on HAoECs. Furthermore, FAK/Pyk2 activity was not limited to CAM expression but was also required for expression of various pro-inflammatory molecules including MCP-1 and IP-10. Both TNF-α and IL-1β signaling requires FAK/Pyk2 activity to activate ERK and JNK MAPKs leading to inflammatory gene expression. Knockdown of either FAK or Pyk2 reduced TNF-α-stimulated ERK and JNK activation and CAM expression, suggesting that activation of ERK or JNK is specific through FAK and Pyk2. Finally, FAK/Pyk2 activity is required for VCAM-1 expression and macrophage recruitment to the vessel wall in a carotid ligation model in ApoE-/- mice. Our findings define critical roles of FAK/Pyk2 in mediating inflammatory cytokine signaling and implicate FAK/Pyk2 inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents to treat vascular inflammatory disease such as atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31400959>Electroacupuncture relieved visceral and referred hindpaw hypersensitivity in colitis rats by inhibiting  hydroxylase expression in the sixth lumbar dorsal root ganglia.</a></h2><p>Irritable bowel syndrome patients frequently complain of pain in body regions somatotopically distinct from the gut, suggesting the involvement of an exaggerated signaling process in both visceral and somatic sensory pathways. Increasing evidence has shown that sprouting of  hydroxylase immunoreactive (TH-IR) fibers toward sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia maintains and exacerbates the neuropathic and inflammatory pain, as well as colonic . The aim of the present study was to determine whether electroacupuncture could alleviate the visceral and secondary somatic hyperalgesia in colitis rats by suppressing the TH-IR expression in related dorsal root ganglia. After trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid irritation, rats developed inflammatory tissue damage in the distal colon, which was accompanied by visceral hypersensitivity and secondary hind paw hyperalgesia, as indicated by enhanced visceromotor response to colorectal distension and decreased mechanical and thermal withdrawal latency of the hind paw. Additionally, excessive TH-IR fibers sprouted toward calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive sensory neurons, and TH-IR neurons also increased in the sixth lumbar dorsal root ganglia of colitis rats. Both electroacupuncture and guanethidine attenuated visceral and referred hind paw hyperalgesia by inhibiting the over-expression of TH-IR neurons and fibers in the sixth lumbar dorsal root ganglia. Moreover local inflammatory damage in the distal colon was restored after 7 days of electroacupuncture intervention. These results suggest that electroacupuncture relieved visceral and referred hind paw hypersensitivity in colitis rats by inhibiting TH expression in the sixth lumbar dorsal root ganglia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The best characterized are angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang2). Ang1 is a potent angiogenic growth factor signaling through Tie2, whereas Ang2 was initially identified as a vascular disruptive agent with antagonistic activity through the same receptor. Recent data demonstrates that Ang2 has context-dependent agonist activities. Ang2 plays important roles in physiological processes and the deregulation of its expression is characteristic of several diseases. In this review, we summarize the activity of Ang2 on blood and lymphatic endothelial cells, its significance in human physiology and disease, and provide a current view of the molecular signaling pathways regulated by Ang2 in endothelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474996>Inhibition of PTP1B Promotes M2 Polarization via MicroRNA-26a/MKP1 Signaling Pathway in Murine Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that often occurs in the intensive care unit. The excessive activation of the host's immune system at early stages contributes to multiple organ damage. Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP1) exerts an important effect on the inflammatory process. In our recent bioinformatic analysis, we confirmed that the inhibition of protein  phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) significantly promoted the expression of MKP1 in murine macrophages. However, the underlying mechanism and its effect on macrophage polarization remain unclear. In this study, we show that the suppression of PTP1B induced upregulation of MKP1 in M1 macrophages. A RayBiotech mouse  antibody assay further revealed that MKP1-knockdown promoted pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, IL12p70, IL-17, IL-21, IL-23, and TNF-α) secretion but suppressed anti-proinflammatory cytokine (IL-10) production in M2 macrophages. Phospho-proteomics analysis further identified ERK1/2 and p38 as downstream molecules of MKP1. Moreover, we found that the inhibition of PTP1B lowered the expression of miR-26a, showing a negative correlation with MKP1 protein expression. Thus, we concluded that the inhibition of PTP1B contributes to M2 macrophage polarization via reducing mir-26a and afterwards enhancing MKP1 expression in murine macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649305>Macrophages reprogrammed by lung cancer microparticles promote tumor development via release of IL-1β.</a></h2><p>Despite their mutual antagonism,  and immunosuppression coexist in tumor microenvironments due to tumor and immune cell interactions, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Previously, we showed that tumor cell-derived microparticles induce an M2 phenotype characterized by immunosuppression in tumor-infiltrating macrophages. Here, we further showed that lung cancer microparticles (L-MPs) induce macrophages to release a key proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1β, thus promoting lung cancer development. The underlying mechanism involves the activation of TLR3 and the NLRP3 inflammasome by L-MPs. More importantly,  kinase inhibitor treatment-induced L-MPs also induce human macrophages to release IL-1β, leading to a tumor-promoting effect in a humanized mouse model. These findings demonstrated that in addition to their anti-inflammatory effect, L-MPs induce a proinflammatory phenotype in tumor-infiltrating macrophages, promoting the development of inflammatory and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485984>CD47: role in the immune system and application to cancer therapy.</a></h2><p>CD47 is a widely expressed cellular receptor well known for its immunoregulatory functions. By interacting with its ligands, including thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα), integrins, and SH2-domain bearing protein  phosphatase substrate-1 (SHPS-1), it modulates cellular phagocytosis by macrophages, transmigration of neutrophils and activation of dendritic cells, T cells and B cells. Ample studies have shown that various types of cancer express high levels of CD47 to escape from the immune system. Based on this observation, CD47 is currently considered as a prominent target in cancer therapy.Here, we review the role of CD47 in the maintenance of immune system homeostasis. We also depict three emerging CD47-targeting strategies for cancer therapy, including the use of mimicry peptides, antibodies, and gene silencing strategies. Among these approaches, the most advanced one is the use of anti-CD47 antibodies, which enhances cancer cell phagocytosis via inhibition of the CD47-SIRPα axis. These antibodies can also achieve higher anti-cancer efficacies when combined with chemotherapy and immunotherapy and hold promise for improving the survival of patients with cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284023>Genetic loss of Gas6/Mer pathway attenuates silica-induced lung  and fibrosis in mice.</a></h2><p>Long-term inhalation of crystalline silica particles leads to silicosis characterized by pulmonary  and interstitial fibrosis. The growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6) and its  receptor Mer have been implicated to involve in the regulation of , innate immunity and tissue repair. However, the role of Gas6 or Mer in silica-induced lung  and fibrosis has not been investigated previously. In this study, we observed a remarkable increase of Gas6 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from wild-type C57BL/6 mice after silica intratracheal administration. Then, we investigated whether genetic loss of Gas6 or Mer could attenuate silica-induced lung  and fibrosis. Our results showed that Gas6 and Mer mice exhibited reduced lung  response from days 7 to 84 after silica exposure. We also uncovered an overexpression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling protein 1 in silica-treated deficient mice. Moreover, Gas6 or Mer deficiency attenuated silica-induced collagen deposition by inhibiting the expression of transforming growth factor-β. We conclude that gene absence of Gas6 or Mer is protective against silica-induced lung  and fibrosis in mice. Targeting Gas6/Mer pathway may be a potential therapeutic approach to treat pulmonary fibrosis in patients with silicosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p></html>
