It is questionable as to what extent the central nervous system (CNS) is an immune-privileged organ protected by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Recent evidence suggests converging pathways through which viral infection, and its associated immune surveillance processes, may alter the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, and lead to inflammation, swelling of the brain parenchyma and associated neurological syndromes. Here, we expand upon the recent "gateway theory", by which viral infection and other immune activation states may disrupt the specialized  of the BBB endothelium making it permeable to immune cells and factors. The model we outline here builds upon the proposition that this process may actually be initiated by cytokines of the IL-17 family, and recognizing the intimate balance between TH17 and TH9 cytokine profiles systemically. We argue that immune surveillance events, in response to viruses such as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), cause a TH17/TH9 induced gateway through blood brain barrier, and thus lead to characteristic neuroimmune pathology. It is possible and even probable that the novel TH17/TH9 induced gateway, which we describe here, opens as a consequence of any state of immune activation and sustained chronic inflammation, whether associated with viral infection or any other cause of peripheral or central neuroinflammation. This view could lead to new, timely and critical patient-centered therapies for patients with neuroimmune pathologies across a variety of etiologies.BBB - blood brain barrier, BDV - Borna disease virus, CARD - caspase activation and recruitment domains, CD - clusters of differentiation, CNS - central nervous system, DAMP - damage-associated molecular patterns, DENV - Dengue virus, EBOV - Ebola virus, ESCRT - endosomal sorting complex required for transport-I, HepC - Hepatitis C virus, HIV - human immunodeficiency virus, IFN - interferon, ILn - interleukin-n, IRF-n - interferon regulatory factor-n, MAVS - mitochondrial antiviral-signaling, MBGV - Marburg virus, M-CSF - macrophage colony-stimulating factor, MCP-1 - monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (aka CCL2), MHC - major histocompatibility complex, MIP-α β - macrophage inflammatory protein-1 α β (aka CCL3 & CCL4), MIF - macrophage migration inhibitory factor, NVE - Nipah virus encephalitis, NK - natural killer cell, NLR - NLR, NOD - like receptor, NOD - nucleotide oligomerization domain, PAMP - pathogen-associated molecular patterns, PtdIns - phosphoinositides, PV - Poliovirus, RIG-I - retinoic acid-inducible gene I, RIP - Receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase, RLR - RIG-I-like receptor, sICAM1 - soluble intracellular adhesion molecule 1, STAT-3 - signal tranducer and activator of transcription-3, sVCAM1 - soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, TANK - TRAF family member-associated NF- .

This study aimed to determine site-specific effects of defined macrophage subtypes on the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier.Macrophage subtypes in situ in intestinal specimens of patients with IBD were visualized by immunohistochemistry. In vitro polarization of human peripheral CD14 cells yielded M1 or  macrophages. The influence of primary monocytes or macrophage subtypes on epithelial barrier integrity was analyzed by transepithelial resistance measurements, Western blot analysis, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and cytometric bead array in a coculture model of primary human macrophages and layers of intestinal epithelial cell lines.The lamina propria of the inflamed intestine in patients with IBD, predominantly in Crohn's disease, is massively infiltrated by CD68 cells also positive for inducible nitric oxide synthase and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α. The presence of M1 macrophage shifted the balance in the local macrophage compartment towards a proinflammatory state. In the coculture model, monocytes and M1 macrophages reduced transepithelial resistance as a marker for epithelial barrier integrity. The mechanisms for paracellular leakage included intracellular relocalization of  proteins like claudin-2 and epithelial cell apoptosis. Determined by specific cytokine blockade, M1 macrophages exerted their deleterious effect mainly through TNF-α, whereas monocyte-mediated damage was driven by the inflammasome effector cytokines, interleukin-1β and interleukin-18.Lamina propria monocytes and M1 macrophages invading intestinal tissues directly contribute to disrupting the epithelial barrier through deregulation of  proteins and induction of epithelial cell apoptosis, thus driving intestinal inflammation in IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25797463>Fibrillin-1 impairment enhances blood-brain barrier permeability and xanthoma formation in brains of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice.</a></h2><p>We recently reported that apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient mice with a mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene (ApoE(-/-)Fbn1(C1039G+/-)) develop accelerated atherosclerosis with enhanced inflammation, atherosclerotic plaque rupture, myocardial infarction and sudden death. In the brain, fibrillin-1 functions as an attachment protein in the basement membrane, providing structural support to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Here, we investigated whether fibrillin-1 impairment affects the permeability of the BBB proper and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), and whether this leads to the accelerated accumulation of lipids (xanthomas) in the brain. ApoE(-/-) (n=61) and ApoE(-/-)Fbn1(C1039G+/-) (n=73) mice were fed a Western-type diet (WD). After 14 weeks WD, a significantly higher permeability of the BBB was observed in ApoE(-/-)Fbn1(C1039G+/-) mice compared to age-matched ApoE(-/-) mice. This was accompanied by leukocyte infiltration, enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases and transforming growth factor-β, and by decreased expression of  proteins claudin-5 and occludin. After 20 weeks WD, 83% of ApoE(-/-)Fbn1(C1039G+/-) mice showed xanthomas in the brain, compared to 23% of their ApoE(-/-) littermates. Xanthomas were mainly located in fibrillin-1-rich regions, such as the choroid plexus and the neocortex. Our findings demonstrate that dysfunctional fibrillin-1 impairs BBB/BCSFB integrity, facilitating peripheral leukocyte infiltration, which further degrades the BBB/BCSFB. As a consequence, lipoproteins can enter the brain, resulting in accelerated formation of xanthomas.Copyright © 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, molecular regulation of such a circuity remains undefined. Claudin-1 (Cld-1), a  integral protein deregulation alters colonic epithelial cell (CEC) differentiation, and promotes colitis severity while impairing colitis-associated injury/repair. Tumorigenesis is a product of an unregulated wound-healing process and therefore we postulated that upregulated Cld-1 levels render IBD patients susceptible to the colitis-associated cancer (CAC). Villin Cld-1 mice are used to carryout overexpressed studies in mice. The role of deregulated Cld-1 expression in CAC and the underlying mechanism was determined using a well-constructed study scheme and mouse models of DSS colitis/recovery and CAC. Using an inclusive investigative scheme, we here report that upregulated Cld-1 expression promotes susceptibility to the CAC and its malignancy. Increased mucosal inflammation and defective epithelial homeostasis accompanied the increased CAC in Villin-Cld-1-Tg mice. We further found significantly increased levels of protumorigenic  macrophages and β-cateninSer552 (β-CatSer552) expression in the CAC in Cld-1Tg vs. WT mice. Mechanistic studies identified the role of PI3K/Akt signaling in Cld-1-dependent activation of the β-CatSer552, which, in turn, was dependent on proinflammatory signals. Our studies identify a critical role of Cld-1 in promoting susceptibility to CAC. Importantly, these effects of deregulated Cld-1 were not associated with altered  integrity, but on its noncanonical role in regulating Notch/PI3K/Wnt/ β-CatSer552 signaling. Overall, outcome from our current studies identifies Cld-1 as potential prognostic biomarker for IBD severity and CAC, and a novel therapeutic target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29221142>D-4F increases microRNA-124a and reduces neuroinflammation in diabetic stroke rats.</a></h2><p>D-4F is an apolipoprotein-A1 mimetic peptide that promotes anti-inflammatory effects. MicroRNA-124 is the most abundant brain-specific microRNA and has anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy and mechanisms of D-4F treatment of stroke in type one diabetes mellitus (T1DM) rats. Male Wistar rats were induced with T1DM, subjected to embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion and treated with PBS or D-4F (1 mg/kg i.p.) at 2, 24 and 48 hours after stroke (n=8/group). A battery of function tests, brain blood barrier (BBB) integrity, white matter changes and microRNA expression were evaluated  and . D-4F treatment in T1DM-stroke rats significantly improves functional outcome, decreases BBB leakage, increases  protein expression, decreases white matter damage and inflammatory factor expression, while increasing anti-inflammatory  macrophage polarization in the ischemic brain. D-4F significantly increases microRNA-124a expression, and decreases matrix metalloproteinase-9, tumor necrosis factor-α and toll-like receptor-4 gene expression in the ischemic brain, and in primary cortical neuronal and microglial cultures. Inhibition of microRNA-124 in cultured primary cortical neurons and microglia attenuates D-4F induced anti-inflammatory effects and  macrophage polarization. D-4F treatment of T1DM-stroke increases microRNA-124 expression, promotes anti-inflammatory effects and  macrophage polarization, which may contribute to D-4F-induced improvement in neurological function, and BBB and white matter integrity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8824202>Involvement of a heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit in  biogenesis.</a></h2><p>The  (TJ) of polarized epithelial cells is critical for maintaining an impermeant barrier and epithelial cell polarity. The signaling events important for TJ assembly require regulated calcium stores and protein kinase C (PKC), but the earliest signaling events in the cascade have not been well defined. We now show that Galphai2 in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells localizes to a region overlapping with the TJ. To further analyze the localization of Galpha subunits in epithelial cells, rat Galphao, Q205Lalphao (Galphao "activated" by point mutation) and plasmid without insert (PC) were transfected into MDCK cells and localized by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Similar to endogenous Galphai2, Galphao-MDCK cells localize Galphao, (84% similar to Galphai2) in the subapical region overlapping with ZO-1 (zona occludens-I), a key component of the TJ. PC-MDCK cells have no detectable Galphao. In Galphao-MDCK cells, a physical association of Galphao with components of the TJ was detectable by immunoprecipitation of ZO-1. Immunoprecipitates of ZO-1 from Galphao-MDCK cells consistently coprecipitated Galphao. Constitutively active Q205LGalphao localized to the subapical lateral membrane similar to wild-type Galphao. To determine if constitutively activated Galpha subunits can affect TJ biogenesis, the formation of  in PC, Galphao, and Q205Lalphao-MDCK cells was followed by measurement of transepithelial resistance (TER) during the Ca2+ switch, a model widely used to study mechanisms of junctional assembly. Baseline and post Ca2+ switch TER values did not differ among the cell lines. However, constitutively activated Q205Lalphao-MDCK cells developed TER significantly faster than PC and Galphao cells in the early phase (0-4 h) (54 +/- 4 versus 23 +/- 3 (PC); 12 +/- 1 (Galphao) Omega./h) and late phase (4-h peak) (117 +/- 10 versus 45 +/- 5 (PC); 66 +/- 7 (Galphao) Omega./h) after Ca2+ switch. Peak TER values were significantly higher in Q205Lalphao-MDCK cells (1168 +/- 107 versus 437 +/- 37 (PC); 548 +/- 54 (Galphao) Omega.cm2). These results indicate that Galphao and Q205Lalphao expressed in MDCK cells are localized near the junctional complex, associate with at least one TJ protein, and that activated Galphao accelerates TJ biogenesis without significantly affecting the maintenance of the TJ. Together, these results suggest an important role for heterotrimeric G proteins in TJ assembly.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22268650>Claudin-1, claudin-2 and claudin-11 genes differentially associate with distinct types of anti-inflammatory macrophages in vitro and with parasite- and tumour-elicited macrophages in vivo.</a></h2><p>Macrophages altered by various Th2-associated and anti-inflammatory mediators--including IL-4 and IL-13 [inducing alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs)], IL-10 and TGF-β--were generically termed . However, markers that discriminate between AAMs and other  remain scarce. We previously described E-cadherin as a marker for AAMs, permitting these macrophages to fuse upon IL-4 stimulation. To identify novel potential contributors to macrophage fusion, we assessed the effect of IL-4 on other adherens and tight junction-associated components. We observed an induction of claudin-1 (Cldn1), Cldn2 and Cldn11 genes by IL-4 in different mouse macrophage populations. Extending our findings to other stimuli revealed Cldn1 as a mainly TGF-β-induced gene and showed that Cldn11 is predominantly associated with IL-4-induced AAMs. Cldn2 is upregulated by diverse stimuli and is not associated with a specific macrophage activation state in vitro. Interestingly, different claudin genes preferentially associate with  from distinct diseases. While Cldn11 is predominantly expressed in AAMs from helminth-infected mice, Cldn1 is the major macrophage claudin during chronic trypanosomiasis and Cldn2 dominates in tumour-associated macrophages.

Prior studies of minocycline investigated short-term neuroprotective effects during subacute stage of stroke; however, the late effects of minocycline against early reperfusion injury on neurovascular remodeling are less well studied. We have shown that spontaneous angiogenesis vessels in ischemic brain regions have high blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability due to lack of major  proteins (TJPs) in endothelial cells at three weeks. In the present study, we longitudinally investigated neurological outcome, neurovascular remodeling and microglia/macrophage alternative activation after spontaneous and minocycline-induced stroke recovery.Adult spontaneously hypertensive rats had a 90 minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. At the onset of reperfusion they received a single dose of minocycline (3 mg/kg intravenously) or a vehicle. They were studied at multiple time points up to four weeks with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), immunohistochemistry and biochemistry.Minocycline significantly reduced the infarct size and prevented tissue loss in the ischemic hemispheres compared to vehicle-treated rats from two to four weeks as measured with MRI. Cerebral blood flow measured with arterial spin labeling (ASL) showed that minocycline improved perfusion. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI indicated that minocycline reduced BBB permeability accompanied with higher levels of TJPs measured with Western blot. Increased MMP-2 and -3 were detected at four weeks. Active microglia/macrophage, surrounding and within the peri-infarct areas, expressed YM1, a marker of  microglia/macrophage activation, at four weeks. These microglia/macrophage expressed both pro-inflammatory factors tumor necrosis factors-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and anti-inflammatory factors transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and interleukin-10 (IL-10). Treatment with minocycline significantly reduced levels of TNF-α and IL-1β, and increased levels of TGF-β, IL-10 and YM1.Early minocycline treatment against reperfusion injury significantly promotes neurovascular remodeling during stroke recovery by reducing brain tissue loss, enhancing TJP expression in ischemic brains and facilitating neuroprotective phenotype alternative activation of microglia/macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839193>Neuroprotective Effects of BHDPC, a Novel Neuroprotectant, on Experimental Stroke by Modulating Microglia Polarization.</a></h2><p>This study mainly investigated the therapeutic effects of BHDPC on ischemic stroke and its underlying mechanisms. In vivo, the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used to induce ischemic model. In vitro, oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced ischemic stroke in BV-2 microglia and primary neurons, and bEnd.3 mouse cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) were also used. First, we found that BHDPC exerts considerable neuroprotection against MCAO-induced ischemic injury to mice via alleviating neurological deficits and brain infarcts, inhibiting neuronal cell loss and apoptosis, and attenuating blood-brain barrier disruption and  protein changes. Next, we observed that BHDPC significantly reduced microglial M1 activation but enhanced  polarization in MCAO-induced ischemic brain. Further experiments in vitro indicated that BHDPC suppressed microglial activation but promoted  microglial polarization in OGD/R-induced BV-2 microglia. In addition, conditioned medium (CM) experiments showed that CM from BHDPC-treated BV-2 microglia provided protections against OGD/R-induced ischemic damage in primary neurons and bEnd.3 ECs. Moreover, we found that BHDPC actions on microglial inflammation were associated with the inactivation of NF-κB signaling. Interestingly, we also found that BHDPC enhanced phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA) and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). The pharmacological inhibition or gene knockdown of PKA/CREB signaling diminished BHDPC-promoted microglial  polarization. In summary, BHDPC conferred neuroprotection against ischemic injury in experimental stroke models. Modulating microglial activation and polarization contributes to BHDPC-mediated neuroprotective actions, which in part were mediated by nuclear factor kappa B and PKA/CREB signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901977>Effect of Heat Stress and Stocking Density onGrowth Performance, Breast Meat Quality,and Intestinal Barrier Function in Broiler Chickens.</a></h2><p>The present experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of heat stress (HS) andstocking density (SD) on growth performance, breast meat quality, and intestinal barrier functionin broiler chickens. Experimental treatments included two different ambient temperatures (20 °C:thermoneutral conditions, or 27.8 °C: HS conditions) and two different SD (low: 9 birds/ andhigh: 18 birds/) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. A total of 1140 21-day-old broiler chickens wereallotted 1 of 4 treatments with five replicates. At the end of the experiment (35 days of age), twobirds per replicate were euthanized for sample collections. The results indicated no interactionsbetween HS and SD for all measurements. For main effects, HS decreased (p < 0.05) the growthperformance of broiler chickens. Similarly, high SD also decreased (p < 0.05) body weight gain andfeed intake. HS decreased (p < 0.01) jejunal trans-epithelial electric resistance (TER), whereas highSD did not affect TER. Neither HS nor high SD affected jejunal -related geneexpressions; however, high SD reduced (p < 0.05) occludin expression. In conclusion, HS and highSD are key environmental factors decreasing broiler performance; however, the interactive effectsof HS and high SD are not significant under the current conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6907080>Ultrastructural organization of the alveolar-capillary unit.</a></h2><p>As a result of its special position in the circulatory system the lung can screen and monitor the composition of the blood which comes from and is returned to all the tissues. This function, together with the exchange of gases, takes place at the level of the alveolar-capillary unit. The cellular components of the unit are: the epithelium, lining the air spaces, and the endothelium, facing the blood compartment. The epithelium is composed of two types of cells: type I--broad, squamous, highly branched cells occupying approximately 97% of the total alveolar surface; these cells seem to be involved mostly in exchange of gases; and type II--cuboidal cells containing characteristic osmiophilic lamellar bodies in their cytoplasm. The epithelial cells are connected to one another by . A thin layer of a surface-active material--the surfactant--covers the epithelium toward the air space, where its role is to lower the surface tension. Surfactant is a mixture of lipids (approximately 75%) and proteins; dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine is the major lipid component and is synthesized and secreted by type II epithelial cells. The endothelium is of continuous type and has a large population of plasmalemmal vesicles; the cells are linked together by . Morphometric studies indicate that in humans the capillary surface area is approximately 120  and the alveolar surface area is approximately 140 . Some of the metabolic functions ascribed to the lung have been localized to cellular components. Phospholipids needed for the constantly renewed surfactant are synthesized in type II epithelial cells. Angiotensin-converting enzyme is associated with the endothelial cell membrane and vesicles opening to the blood front. There are indications that pulmonary cells also intervene in the metabolism of circulating vasoactive substances which during their passage through the lung can be activated (angiotensin I), inactivated (bradykinin) or removed from the circulation (5-hydroxytryptamine). The lung is a metabolically active organ where the anabolism and catabolism of pharmacologically active substances and the synthesis of lipids take place and a proper balance for blood homeostasis is maintained.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26299579>MiR-126 Contributes to Human Umbilical Cord Blood Cell-Induced Neurorestorative Effects After Stroke in Type-2 Diabetic Mice.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a high risk factor for stroke and leads to more severe vascular and white-matter injury than stroke in non-DM. We tested the neurorestorative effects of delayed human umbilical cord blood cell (HUCBC) treatment of stroke in type-2 diabetes (T2DM). db/db-T2DM and db/+-non-DM mice were subjected to distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAo) and were treated 3 days after dMCAo with: (a) non-DM + Phosphate buffered saline (PBS); (b) T2DM + PBS; (c) T2DM + naïve-HUCBC; (d) T2DM + miR-126(-/-) HUCBC. Functional evaluation, vascular and white-matter changes, neuroinflammation, and miR-126 effects were measured in vivo and in vitro. T2DM mice exhibited significantly decreased serum and brain tissue miR-126 expression compared with non-DM mice. T2DM + HUCBC mice exhibited increased miR-126 expression, increased  protein expression, axon/myelin, vascular density, and -macrophage polarization. However, decreased blood-brain barrier leakage, brain hemorrhage, and miR-126 targeted gene vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 expression in the ischemic brain as well as improved functional outcome were present in HUCBC-treated T2DM mice compared with control T2DM mice. MiR-126(-/-) HUCBC-treatment abolished the benefits of naïve-HUCBC-treatment in T2DM stroke mice. In vitro, knock-in of miR-126 in primary cultured brain endothelial cells (BECs) or treatment of BECs with naïve-HUCBCs significantly increased capillary-like tube formation, and increased axonal outgrowth in primary cultured cortical neurons; whereas treatment of BECs or cortical neurons with miR-126(-/-) HUCBC attenuated HUCBC-treatment-induced capillary tube formation and axonal outgrowth. Our data suggest delayed HUCBC-treatment of stroke increases vascular/white-matter remodeling and anti-inflammatory effects; MiR-126 may contribute to HUCBC-induced neurorestorative effects in T2DM mice.© 2015 AlphaMed Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30802726>Naringenin promotes recovery from colonic damage through suppression of epithelial tumor necrosis factor-α production and induction of -type macrophages in colitic mice.</a></h2><p>Our previous study demonstrated that supplemental naringenin reduced the development of colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in mice, however, the effect of naringenin on the recovery from colonic damage was totally unknown. The primary purpose was to investigate if naringenin promoted recovery from colonic damage in DSS-administered mice and colonic tissues. When mice were fed diets lacking or containing naringenin (0.3%, w/w) for 11 days after colitis induction through DSS administration, the supplemental naringenin was found to promote a reversal of body weight loss and suppress tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α mRNA expression in the DSS-administered mice. Moreover, protein expression of two  proteins, claudin-3 and junctional adhesion molecule-A, was higher in DSS-administered mice that were fed naringenin than in the mice that did not receive naringenin. To examine the early mechanisms underlying the naringenin-mediated reduction of colonic damage, the inflamed colonic tissues of DSS-administered mice were incubated with or without naringenin for 24 hours; in tissues incubated with naringenin, TNF-α production was lower and interleukin (IL)-10 and CD206 mRNA expression was higher than in tissues incubated without naringenin, but naringenin did not affect the expression of the  proteins. Flow cytometry results further demonstrated that naringenin reduced TNF-α-positive epithelial cells, but not macrophages, and promoted the polarization of -type macrophages in the colonic tissues. Thus, supplemental naringenin promoted recovery from colonic damage in mice with colitis, and suppression of epithelial TNF-α production and induction of -type macrophages might represent the early mechanisms underlying this naringenin effect.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Altered expression of E-cadherin has been implicated in tumor invasion. Analysis of mutations of the human E-cadherin gene in gastric carcinoma of the diffuse type has revealed that deletion of exon 8 or 9 in its cDNA appears to be predominant. In this study, we carried out structural and functional analyses of a mutant form of E-cadherin in a cell line, HSC45-, established from a human signet ring-cell carcinoma. Although immunohistochemical analysis showed that the mutant cadherin was localized at cell-cell contact sites as usually seen with the wild type, these cells did not form compact colonies. HSC45- cells expressed aberrant E-cadherin with an m.w. larger than that of the wild type. In these cells, we found deletion of the exon 9-intron 9 boundary including the splicing donor site in E-cadherin genomic DNA. RT-PCR indicated 2 transcripts, which appeared to be caused by the splicing defect. Northern blotting, however, showed that the transcript lacking exon 9 was predominantly detected in these cells. The electrophoretic mobilities on SDS-PAGE of the mutant E-cadherin protein in HSC45- cells and the protein expressed from cDNA lacking exon 9 appeared identical. Analysis of the amino-terminal region of the mutant E-cadherin protein revealed that the cadherin was capable of becoming a mature form by removal of its amino-terminal peptide. However, the mutant E-cadherin was susceptible to trypsinization in the presence of Ca(2+), which is not the case for wild-type E-cadherin, suggesting that the mutant E-cadherin frequently found in diffuse-type gastric carcinoma may have lost its Ca(2+)-binding ability, leading to disruption of the tight cell-cell association.Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19486886>GM2 activator protein inhibits platelet activating factor signaling in rats.</a></h2><p>Platelet activating factor (PAF), an endogenous bioactive phospholipid, has been documented as a pivotal mediator in the inflammatory cascade underlying the pathogenesis of many diseases including necrotizing enterocolitis.

Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1), also known as breast regression protein 39 (BRP-39) in mice and human homologue YKL-40, plays important roles in Th2 inflammation and allergen sensitization. CHI3L1 has been implicated in a variety of diseases including asthma characterized by inflammation, apoptosis and tissue remodelling, but its role in AD remains elusive.The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CHI3L1 in the development and progression of AD.We investigated YKL-40 levels in the serum and skin of AD patients by ELISA and immunofluorescence, respectively. Using a murine model of AD induced by ovalbumin (OVA), we investigated Th2 immune responses,  macrophage activation and skin barrier gene expression using wild-type (WT) and BRP-39 null mutant (BRP-39 ) mice. YKL-40 level was significantly increased in serum of AD patients. In addition, both mRNA and protein expression levels of BRP-39 were higher in OVA-sensitized WT mice than in control mice. OVA-sensitized BRP-39 mice showed decreased epidermal thickness, lower total serum IgE, Th2 cytokine levels and CD4 effector T cell populations than OVA-sensitized WT mice. Induction of BRP-39 was dominant in dermal macrophages. BRP-39 deficiency was found to be involved in  macrophage activation. Consistently, the YKL-40 level in the skin of AD patients was higher than in normal subjects and it was expressed in dermal macrophages. BRP-39 deficiency attenuated dysregulation of skin barrier and  genes.These findings demonstrate that CHI3L1 mediates the development of AD induced by OVA, affecting Th2 inflammation,  macrophage activation and skin barrier function.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30339173>Deoxycholic acid disrupts the intestinal mucosal barrier and promotes intestinal tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>High-fat diet, which leads to an increased level of deoxycholic acid (DCA) in the intestine, is a major environmental factor in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, evidence relating to bile acids and intestinal tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of DCA on the intestinal mucosal barrier and its impact on the development of CRC. Here we showed that DCA disrupted cell monolayer integrity and increased proinflammatory cytokine production in intestinal cancer and precancerous cell lines (Caco-2 and IMCE). Apcmin/+ mice receiving DCA increased the number and size of intestinal adenomas and promoted the adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence. Importantly, DCA induced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, increased the production of inflammatory cytokines, and led to intestinal low grade inflammation. A reduction of  protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and the number of intestinal cells including goblet cells and Paneth cells was also observed after DCA treatment. Moreover, DCA significantly reduced the level of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), and promoted the polarization of  macrophages in the intestine of Apcmin/+ mice. In conclusion, these data suggested that DCA induced intestinal low grade inflammation and disrupted the mucosal physical and functional barriers, aggravating intestinal tumorigenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16999215>Normal endothelium.</a></h2><p>In recent decades, it has become evident that the endothelium is by no means a passive inner lining of blood vessels. This 'organ' with a large surface (approximately 350 ) and a comparatively small total mass (approximately 110 g) is actively involved in vital functions of the cardiovascular system, including regulation of perfusion, fluid and solute exchange, haemostasis and coagulation, inflammatory responses, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. The present chapter focusses on two central aspects of endothelial structure and : (1) the heterogeneity in endothelial properties between species, organs, vessel classes and even within individual vessels and (2) the composition and role of the molecular layer on the luminal surface of endothelial cells. The endothelial lining of blood vessels in different organs differs with respect to morphology and permeability and is classified as 'continuous', 'fenestrated' or 'discontinuous'. Furthermore, the mediator release, antigen presentation or stress responses of endothelial cells vary between species, different organs and vessel classes. Finally there are relevant differences even between adjacent endothelial cells, with some cells exhibiting specific functional properties, e.g. as pacemaker cells for intercellular calcium signals. Organ-specific structural and functional properties of the endothelium are marked in the vascular beds of the lung and the brain. Pulmonary endothelium exhibits a high constitutive expression of adhesion molecules which may contribute to the margination of the large intravascular pool of leucocytes in the lung. Furthermore, the pulmonary microcirculation is less permeable to protein and water flux as compared to large pulmonary vessels. Endothelial cells of the blood-brain  exhibit a specialised phenotype with no fenestrations, extensive tight junctions and sparse pinocytotic vesicular transport. This  allows a strict control of exchange of solutes and circulating cells between the plasma and the interstitial space. It was observed that average haematocrit levels in muscle capillaries are much lower as compared to systemic haematocrit, and that flow resistance of microvascular beds is higher than expected from in vitro studies of blood rheology. This evidence stimulated the concept of a substantial layer on the luminal endothelial surface (endothelial surface layer, ESL) with a thickness in the range of 0.5-1 microm. In comparison, the typical thickness of the glycocalyx directly anchored in the endothelial plasma membrane, as seen in electron micrographs, amounts to only about 50-100 microm. Therefore it is assumed that additional components, e.g. adsorbed plasma proteins or hyaluronan, are essential in constituting the ESL. Functional consequences of the ESL presence are not yet sufficiently understood and acknowledged. However, it is evident that the thick endothelial surface layer significantly impacts haemodynamic conditions, mechanical stresses acting on red cells in microvessels, oxygen transport, vascular control, coagulation, inflammation and atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28069576>Dysbiosis and zonulin upregulation alter gut epithelial and vascular barriers in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.</a></h2><p>Dysbiosis has been recently demonstrated in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) but its implications in the modulation of intestinal immune responses have never been studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ileal bacteria in modulating local and systemic immune responses in AS.Ileal biopsies were obtained from 50 HLA-B27 patients with AS and 20 normal subjects. Silver stain was used to visualise bacteria. Ileal expression of  and adherens  proteins was investigated by TaqMan real-time (RT)-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Serum levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS-binding protein (LPS-BP), intestinal fatty acid-BP (iFABP) and zonulin were assayed by ELISA. Monocyte immunological functions were studied in in vitro experiments. In addition the effects of antibiotics on  in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 transgenic (TG) rats were assessed.Adherent and invasive bacteria were observed in the gut of patients with AS with the bacterial scores significantly correlated with gut inflammation. Impairment of the gut vascular barrier (GVB) was also present in AS, accompanied by significant upregulation of zonulin, and associated with high serum levels of LPS, LPS-BP, iFABP and zonulin. In in vitro studies zonulin altered endothelial  while its epithelial release was modulated by isolated AS ileal bacteria. AS circulating monocytes displayed an anergic phenotype partially restored by ex vivo stimulation with LPS+sCD14 and their stimulation with recombinant zonulin induced a clear  phenotype. Antibiotics restored  function in HLA-B27 TG rats.Bacterial ileitis, increased zonulin expression and damaged intestinal mucosal barrier and GVB, characterises the gut of patients with AS and are associated with increased blood levels of zonulin, and bacterial products. Bacterial products and zonulin influence monocyte behaviour.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

A microarray approach.</a></h2><p>We used a microarray approach to examine changes in gene expression in turbot peritoneal cells after injection of the fish with vaccines containing the ciliate parasite Philasterides dicentrarchi as antigen and one of the following adjuvants: chitosan-PVMMA microspheres, Freund́s complete adjuvant, aluminium hydroxide gel or Matrix-Q (Isconova, Sweden). We identified 374 genes that were differentially expressed in all groups of fish. Forty-two genes related to  and focal adhesions and/or actin cytoskeleton were differentially expressed in free peritoneal cells. The profound changes in gene expression related to cell adherence and cytoskeleton may be associated with cell migration and also with the formation of cell-vaccine masses and their attachment to the peritoneal wall. Thirty-five genes related to apoptosis were differentially expressed. Although most of the proteins coded by these genes have a proapoptotic effect, others are antiapoptotic, indicating that both types of signals occur in peritoneal leukocytes of vaccinated fish. Interestingly, many of the genes related to lymphocytes and lymphocyte activity were downregulated in the groups injected with vaccine. We also observed decreased expression of genes related to antigen presentation, suggesting that macrophages (which were abundant in the peritoneal cavity after vaccination) did not express these during the early inflammatory response in the peritoneal cavity. Finally, several genes that participate in the inflammatory response were differentially expressed, and most participated in resolution of inflammation, indicating that an  macrophage response is generated in the peritoneal cavity of fish one day post vaccination.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years, intestinal inflammation has been suggested to contribute to obesity related metabolic syndrome and targeting gut inflammation with 5-ASA improves diet induced IR, however, its role in dyslipidemia is unknown and has never been explored. In the present study, we reported for the first time that administration of 5-ASA for 12 weeks significantly improved lipid profile by repressing plasma triglycerides and free cholesterol levels in mice fed high-fat cholesterol diet (HFC). In addition, liver lipids were significantly reduced by 5-ASA treatment in HFC-fed mice. Mechanistically, anti-inflammatory genes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (Pparγ) and  marker, such as Mrc1 and Ym1, were remarkably upregulated, while pro-inflammation gene monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (Mcp-1) were downregulated in small intestine of mice treated by 5-ASA. Further, 5-ASA improved gastrointestinal barrier by increasing the expression of the  marker ZO-1. 5-ASA also enhanced cholesterol translocation by elevating genes expression of Npc1l1 and Abcg5/8. Moreover, mice fed HFC 5-ASA expressed increased Pparα in small intestinal and its target genes function in lipid oxidation and hydrolysis were remarkable elevated. Taken together, we reported a novel role of 5-ASA which may serve as a therapy target intestinal inflammation induced dyslipidemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462699>Intestinal epithelial PKM2 serves as a safeguard against experimental colitis via activating β-catenin signaling.</a></h2><p>The pyruvate kinase  (PKM2)-mediated aerobic glycolysis has been shown to play a critical role in promoting cell survival and proliferation. However, little is known about the function of intestinal epithelial PKM2 in intestine homeostasis. Here we investigate whether and how intestinal epithelial PKM2 modulates the morphology and function of the adult intestine in experimental colitis. Analyzing colonoscopic biopsies from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients, we found significantly decreased level of intestinal epithelial PKM2 in patients compared to that in non-inflamed tissues. Similar reduction of intestinal epithelial PKM2 was observed in mice with dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Moreover, intestinal epithelial-specific PKM2-knockout (Pkm2) mice displayed more severe intestinal inflammation, as evidenced by a shortened colon, disruption of epithelial , an increase in inflammatory cytokine levels, and immune cell infiltration, when compared to wild-type mice. Gene profiling, western blot, and function analyses indicated that cell survival signals, particularly the Wnt/β-catenin pathways, were associated with PKM2 activity. Increasing mouse intestinal epithelial PKM2 expression via delivery of a PKM2-expressing plasmid attenuated experimental colitis. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that intestinal epithelial PKM2 increases cell survival and wound healing under the colitic condition via activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20064788>Polychlorinated biphenyls disrupt blood-brain  integrity and promote brain metastasis formation.</a></h2><p>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) comprise a ubiquitous class of toxic substances associated with carcinogenic and tumor-promoting effects as well as neurotoxic properties in the brain. However, the effects of PCBs on the development of tumor metastases are not fully understood.We evaluated the hypothesis that exposure to individual PCB congeners can facilitate the development of brain metastases in immunocompetent mice via the disruption of the integrity of the blood-brain  (BBB).C57/Bl6 mice were exposed to individual PCBs by oral gavage, and 48 hr later they were injected with luciferase-labeled K1735  melanoma cells into the internal carotid artery. The development of metastatic nodules was monitored by bioluminescent imaging. In addition, we evaluated the functional permeability of the BBB by measuring permeability of sodium fluorescein across the brain microvessels. Expression and colocalization of tight junction (TJ) proteins were studied by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy.Oral administration of coplanar PCB126, mono-ortho-substituted PCB118, and non-coplanar PCB153 (each at 150 micromol/kg body weight) differentially altered expression of the TJ proteins claudin-5, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 in brain capillaries. These alterations were associated with increased permeability of the BBB. Most importantly, exposure to individual PCB congeners enhanced the rate of formation and progression of brain metastases of luciferase-tagged melanoma cells.Our results show for the first time that exposure to individual PCBs can facilitate the formation of bloodborne metastases via alterations of the integrity of the brain capillary endothelium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29643467>Potential Orphan Drug Therapy of Intravesical Liposomal Onabotulinumtoxin-A for Ketamine-Induced Cystitis by Mucosal Protection and Anti-inflammation in a Rat Model.</a></h2><p>Ketamine abusers may develop ulcerative cystitis and severe lower urinary tract symptoms, which is a medical dilemma. Recently, researchers have found the endemic of ketamine-induced cystitis worldwide. The intravesical administration of liposome-encapsulated onabotulinumtoxinA (Lipotoxin) might facilitate the healing of the damaged urothelium from liposomes, and reduce the urinary symptoms by onabotulinumtoxinA-induced chemo-denervation. Using female Sprague-Dawley rats, we investigated the effects of Lipotoxin on ketamine-induced cystitis. Functional magnetic resonance imaging, metabolic cage study, and cystometry were conducted. Paraffin-embedded sections were stained. The bladder mucosa and muscle proteins were assessed through Western blotting. We observed that repeated intravesical Lipotoxin instillation could improve suburothelial hemorrhage, recover the urothelial  and adhesion proteins (zonula occludens-1 and E-cadherin), ensure less substance P in the urothelium, inhibit the overexpression of inflammatory mediators (IL-6, TNF-α, nuclear NF-κB, and COX-2) in the detrusor, suppress the upregulation of the mucosal TRPV1 and detrusor M-mAChR, and ameliorate bladder overactivity in the ketamine-treated rats. These data reveal the mechanisms underlying the action of Lipotoxin in ketamine-induced cystitis of rats, which provide a basis of Lipotoxin for further treating ketamine-induced cystitis in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23884585>Reovirus receptors, cell entry, and proapoptotic signaling.</a></h2><p>Mammalian orthoreoviruses (reoviruses) are members of the Reoviridae. Reoviruses contain 10 double-stranded (ds) RNA gene segments enclosed in two concentric protein shells, called outer capsid and core. These viruses serve as a versatile experimental system for studies of viral replication events at the virus-cell interface, including engagement of cell-surface receptors, internalization and disassembly, and activation of the innate immune response, including NF-κB-dependent cellular signaling pathways. Reoviruses also provide a model system for studies of virus-induced apoptosis and organ-specific disease in vivo.Reoviruses attach to host cells via the filamentous attachment protein, σ1. The σ1 protein of all reovirus serotypes engages junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A), an integral component of intercellular . The σ1 protein also binds to cell-surface carbohydrate, with the type of carbohydrate bound varying by serotype. Following attachment to JAM-A and carbohydrate, reovirus internalization is mediated by β1 integrins, most likely via clathrin-dependent endocytosis. In the endocytic compartment, reovirus outer-capsid protein σ3 is removed by acid-dependent cysteine proteases in most cell types. Removal of σ3 results in the exposure of a hydrophobic conformer of the viral membrane-penetration protein, μ1, which pierces the endosomal membrane and delivers transcriptionally active reovirus core particles into the cytoplasm.Reoviruses induce apoptosis in both cultured cells and infected mice. Perturbation of reovirus disassembly using inhibitors of endosomal acidification or protease activity abrogates apoptosis. The μ1-encoding  gene is genetically linked to strain-specific differences in apoptosis-inducing capacity, suggesting a function for μ1 in induction of death signaling. Reovirus disassembly leads to activation of transcription factor NF-κB, which modulates apoptotic signaling in numerous types of cells. Inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation using either pharmacologic agents or expression of transdominant forms of IκB blocks reovirus-induced apoptosis, suggesting an essential role for NF-κB activation in the death response. Multiple effector pathway s downstream of NF-κB-directed gene expression execute reovirus-induced cell death. This chapter will focus on the mechanisms by which reovirus attachment and disassembly activate NF-κB and stimulate the cellular proapoptotic machinery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29653264>Helminth infection in mice improves insulin sensitivity via modulation of gut microbiota and fatty acid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Intestinal helminths are prevalent in individuals who live in rural areas of developing countries, where obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome are rare. In the present study, we analyzed the modulation of the gut microbiota in mice infected with the helminth Strongyloides venezuelensis, and fed either a standard rodent chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD). To investigate the effects of the microbiota modulation on the metabolism, we analyzed the expression of  proteins present in the gut epithelium, inflammatory markers in the serum and tissue and quantified glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and resistance. Additionally, the levels of lipids related to inflammation were evaluated in the feces and serum. Our results show that infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis results in a modification of the gut microbiota, most notably by increasing Lactobacillus spp. These modifications in the microbiota alter the host metabolism by increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, switching macrophages from a M1 to  pattern in the adipose tissue, increasing the expression of  proteins in the intestinal cells (thereby reducing the permeability) and decreasing LPS in the serum. Taken together, these changes correlate with improved insulin signaling and sensitivity, which could also be achieved with HFD mice treated with probiotics. Additionally, helminth infected mice produce higher levels of oleic acid, which participates in anti-inflammatory pathways. These results suggest that modulation of the microbiota by helminth infection or probiotic treatment causes a reduction in subclinical inflammation, which has a positive effect on the glucose metabolism of the host.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We therefore hypothesized that a gluten-free (GF) diet, known to decrease the incidence of type 1 diabetes, would protect against the development of diabetes when fed only during the pregnancy and lactation period. Pregnant nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice were fed a GF or standard diet until all pups were weaned to a standard diet. The early-life GF environment dramatically decreased the incidence of diabetes and insulitis. Gut microbiota analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed a pronounced difference between both mothers and their offspring on different diets, characterized by increased numbers of Akkermansia, Proteobacteria, and TM7 in the GF diet group. In addition, pancreatic forkhead box P3 regulatory T cells were increased in GF-fed offspring, as were  macrophage gene markers and -related genes in the gut, while intestinal gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines was reduced. An increased proportion of T cells in the pancreas expressing the mucosal integrin α4β7 suggests that the mechanism involves increased trafficking of gut-primed immune cells to the pancreas. In conclusion, a GF diet during fetal and early postnatal life reduces the incidence of diabetes. The mechanism may involve changes in gut microbiota and shifts to a less proinflammatory immunological milieu in the gut and pancreas.© 2014 by the American Diabetes Association.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated nuclear receptor, has been implicated to play a role in human uveitis, although the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to enhance our knowledge concerning the role of AhR during intraocular inflammation. We immunized wild-type and AhR-knockout C57BL/6J mice with IRBP to induce experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). Disease severity was evaluated with both clinical and histopathological grading. Blood-retinal barrier (BRB) integrity was tested by Evans blue and  proteins qualifications. Apoptosis was measured using TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining. Macrophage/microglia activation and polarization were studied by immunofluorescence and Western blot. Following EAU induction, AhR mice had more severe clinical and histopathological manifestations of uveitis than AhR mice. Increased vascular permeability and apoptotic cells were observed in AhR EAU mice when compared with AhR EAU mice. In addition, AhR EAU mice showed evidence of a significantly increased macrophage/microglia cells and a stronger polarization from the  to the M1 phenotype as compared to AhR EAU mice. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β were increased in AhR EAU mice, which was associated with the activation of NF-κB and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathways. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), an agonist of AhR, caused a significant decrease in the clinical and histopathological manifestations, preserved BRB integrity, reduced apoptotic cells, inhibited macrophage/microglia activation, and shifted their polarization from M1 toward . Moreover, decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β and inhibition of NF-κB and STAT pathways were found in EAU mice following TCDD treatment. In conclusion, AhR activation with TCDD exhibits an immunomodulatory effect by reducing BRB breakdown, inhibiting retinal cell apoptosis, and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine expression during EAU. The underlying mechanism may involve the modulation of macrophages/microglia polarization and the downregulation of NF-κB and STAT pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30329115>Effect of stocking density and sex on growth performance, meat quality, and intestinal barrier function in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>The objective of the current experiment was to investigate the effect of stocking density and sex on growth performance, meat quality, and intestinal barrier function in broiler chickens. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement consisting of sex and four different stocking densities in battery cages. A total of 540 1-d-old Ross 308 broiler chickens were allotted to one of eight treatments with five replicates. Within each sex, birds were raised at four different stocking densities of 15.2, 20.2, 25.3, or 30.4 birds/ from 1 to 28 d of age. Different stocking densities were achieved by raising a different number of birds per battery cage with identical floor size (0.76 m × 0.78 m). At the end of the experiment, two birds per replicate were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation to collect tissue samples for further analyses. Results indicated that no interactions between sex and stocking density were observed for all measurements except for serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations. Increasing stocking density decreased (linear, P < 0.01) body weight gain and feed intake, but had no negative effects on meat quality. Trans-epithelial electrical resistance values, a measure of intestinal permeability, were decreased (linear, P < 0.01) with increasing stocking density, regardless of sex. Accordingly, serum LPS concentrations were increased (linear, P < 0.01) with increasing stocking density. However, increasing stocking density increased serum LPS concentrations in male broiler chickens, but had no effects on female broiler chickens, showing an interaction (P < 0.01). The expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and junctional adhesion molecule B (JAM-2) was decreased (linear, P < 0.05) with increasing stocking density. In conclusion, increasing stocking density decreases broiler performance regardless of sex and this negative effect is likely associated with decreased intestinal barrier function.© 2018 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23110760>Inflammation and neurovascular changes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Neuroinflammation in now established as an important factor in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). At various time points, astrocytes and microglia are markedly activated, either producing neuroprotective or pro-inflammatory molecules, which can decrease or increase the rate of primary motor neuron degeneration respectively. Recent research has shown that this neuroinflammatory component is affected by the peripheral immune system; T lymphocytes in particular are able to cross into the brain and spinal cord parenchyma, where they interact with resident microglia, either inducing them to adopt an M1 (cytotoxic) or  (protective) phenotype, depending on the stage of disease. Clearly understanding the changes that occur to allow the interaction between peripheral and central immune responses will be essential in any attempt to manipulate the disease process via neuroinflammatory mechanisms. However, our understanding of the endothelial changes, which facilitate the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain and spinal cord, is still in its infancy. There are suggestions, though, of up-regulation of cellular adhesion molecules, which are able to arrest circulating leukocytes and facilitate diapedesis into the brain parenchyma. In addition,  proteins appear to be down-regulated, leading to an increase in vascular permeability, an effect that is amplified by vascular damage late in the disease process.

The mechanism of PM-mediated pathophysiology remains unknown. However, PM is proinflammatory to the endothelium and increases vascular permeability in vitro and in vivo via ROS generation.We explored the role of tight junction proteins as targets for PM-induced loss of lung endothelial cell (EC)  integrity and enhanced cardiopulmonary dysfunction.Changes in human lung EC monolayer permeability were assessed by Transendothelial Electrical Resistance (TER) in response to PM challenge (collected from Ft. McHenry Tunnel, Baltimore, MD, particle size >0.1 μm). Biochemical assessment of ROS generation and Ca2+ mobilization were also measured.PM exposure induced tight junction protein Zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) relocation from the cell periphery, which was accompanied by significant reductions in ZO-1 protein levels but not in adherens junction proteins (VE-cadherin and β-catenin). N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC, 5 mM) reduced PM-induced ROS generation in ECs, which further prevented TER decreases and atteneuated ZO-1 degradation. PM also mediated intracellular calcium mobilization via the transient receptor potential cation channel  (TRPM2), in a ROS-dependent manner with subsequent activation of the Ca2+-dependent protease calpain. PM-activated calpain is responsible for ZO-1 degradation and EC  disruption. Overexpression of ZO-1 attenuated PM-induced endothelial  disruption and vascular hyperpermeability in vivo and in vitro.These results demonstrate that PM induces marked increases in vascular permeability via ROS-mediated calcium leakage via activated TRPM2, and via ZO-1 degradation by activated calpain.

The mice were fed  with a liquid diet containing ethanol and fish oil. In the meantime, ethanol was given every 5-7 days by gavage to simulate binge drinking. After the 7 binge, steatosis, necrosis, inflammatory infiltration, and bridging fibrosis were observed in the liver by histological staining. After the 13 binge, the inducers, markers and other downstream genes/proteins of the Kupffer cell M1/ phenotype in the liver, serum, and small intestine were analysed. The results suggested that a chronic high dosage of fish oil alone reduced the mRNA levels of most genes tested and showed a tendency to damage the intestinal zonula occludens-1 localization and reduce the number of  Kupffer cells. Meanwhile, the combination of fish oil and ethanol damaged the intestinal TJs, resulting in an increased endotoxin level in the liver. Gut-derived endotoxin polarized Kupffer cells to the M1 phenotype, whereas the number of cells with the  phenotype (markers: CD163 and CD206) was decreased. Interleukin-4 (IL-4), an  Kupffer cell inducer, was also decreased. Moreover,  experiments showed that IL-4 reversed eicosapentaenoic acid-induced  and  mRNA suppression in RAW 264.7 cells. Overall, our results showed that a chronic high dosage of fish oil exacerbated gut-liver axis injury in alcoholic liver disease in mice, and endotoxin/IL-4-induced Kupffer cell polarization imbalance might play an important role in that process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31240302>A multicentre, phase IIa study of zolbetuximab as a single agent in patients with recurrent or refractory advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or lower oesophagus: the MONO study.</a></h2><p>Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2) is physiologically confined to gastric mucosa ; however, upon malignant transformation, perturbations in cell polarity lead to CLDN18.2 epitopes being exposed on the cancer cell surface. The first-in-class monoclonal antibody, zolbetuximab (formerly known as IMAB362), binds to CLDN18.2 and can induce immune-mediated lysis of CLDN18.2-positive cells.Patients with advanced gastric, gastro-oesophageal  (GEJ) or oesophageal adenocarcinomas with moderate-to-strong CLDN18.2 expression in ≥50% of tumour cells received zolbetuximab intravenously every 2 weeks for five planned infusions. At least three patients were enrolled in two sequential cohorts (cohort 1300 mg/; cohort 2600 mg/); additional patients were enrolled into a dose-expansion cohort (cohort 3600 mg/). The primary end point was the objective response rate [ORR: complete and partial response (PR)]; secondary end points included clinical benefit [ORR+stable disease (SD)], progression-free survival, safety/tolerability, and zolbetuximab pharmacokinetic profile.From September 2010 to September 2012, 54 patients were enrolled (cohort 1, n = 4; cohort 2, n = 6; cohort 3, n = 44). Three patients in cohort 1 and 25 patients in cohorts 2/3 received at least 5 infusions.

Mounting evidence suggests that the predominance of the classically activated (M1) macrophages versus the alternatively activated () macrophages plays a role in the progression of IBD. Thus, agents able to shift pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to anti-inflammatory  macrophages may be beneficial to IBD. The pentacyclic triterpene Lup-20(29)-en-3β-ol (Lupeol), a potent anti-inflammatory natural product, has been shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production, suggesting it is potentially able to modulate macrophage polarization, thereby beneficial to IBD.CD4(+) monocytes were differentiated to M1 or  macrophages, which were cocultured with epithelial cell lines, T84 and Caco-2, in the absence or presence of Lupeol (10μM). Experimental colitis was induced with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), with or without oral administration of Lupeol (50mg/kg, q.d.). Cytokines were measured with Luminex kits. M1/ genes were measured with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Macrophage phenotypes were defined by measuring M1 and  markers with confocal microscopy. Proteins were measured with Western blotting, while cell surface markers were measured with confocal microscopy or flow cytometry. Histology was evaluated with H&E staining.Treatment of M1 macrophages with Lupeol resulted in a marked decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-12, IL6, IL-1β and TNFα, and a marked increase in the production of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. This was associated with a down-regulation of CD86, a typical marker of M1 macrophages, and an up-regulation of CD206, a typical  macrophage marker. IRF5, a transcription factor that is critically involved in M1 polarization, was down-regulated in M1 macrophages after being incubated with Lupeol, associated with a marked decrease in the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase. Coculture of epithelial cells with M1 macrophages resulted in down-regulation of the  protein ZO-1 and disruption of epithelial integrity, which were blocked by Lupeol treatment of the M1 macrophages. Moreover, oral administration of Lupeol to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice resulted in mitigated intestinal inflammation and increased survival from lethal colitis, associated with decreased expression of M1-related genes and increased expression of -related genes.Lupeol ameliorates experimental inflammatory bowel disease through, at least in part, inhibiting M1 and promoting  macrophages.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, the role of PKM2 in nontransformed cells is little studied, and nearly nothing is known of its role, if any, in quiescent cells. We show here that endothelial cells express PKM2 almost exclusively over PKM1. In proliferating endothelial cells, PKM2 is required to suppress p53 and maintain cell cycle progression. In sharp contrast, PKM2 has a strikingly different role in quiescent endothelial cells, where inhibition of PKM2 leads to degeneration of  and barrier function. Mechanistically, PKM2 regulates barrier function independently of its canonical activity as a pyruvate kinase. Instead, PKM2 suppresses NF-kB and its downstream target, the vascular permeability factor angiopoietin 2. As a consequence, loss of endothelial cell PKM2 in vivo predisposes mice to VEGF-induced vascular leak, and to severe bacteremia and death in response to sepsis. Together, these data demonstrate new roles of PKM2 in quiescent cells, and highlight the need for caution in developing cancer therapies that target PKM2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31329969>Effect of stocking density and dietary tryptophan on growth performance and intestinal barrier function in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>The objective of the present experiment was to investigate the effect of stocking density (SD) and dietary supplementation of crystalline tryptophan (Trp) on growth performance and intestinal barrier function in broiler chickens raised in a floor pen. The experiment was conducted using a completely randomized design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement consisting of 2 different SD and 2 supplemental levels of dietary Trp. A total of 1,140 Ross 308 broiler chickens at 21 d of age were allotted to 1 of 4 treatments with 5 replicates. Low SD (9 birds/) and high SD (18 birds/) were achieved by raising different number of birds per identical floor pen (2.0 m × 2.4 m). The basal diet was formulated with no supplemental Trp in diets to meet or exceed nutrient recommendation of the Ross 308 manual. The calculated concentrations of total Trp and digestible Trp in the basal diet were 0.19 and 0.16%, respectively. The other diet was prepared by adding 0.16% crystalline Trp to the basal diet. Diets were fed to birds for 21 d. At the end of the experiment, 2 birds per replicate were euthanized to collect tissue samples for further analyses. Results indicated that there were no interactions between SD and dietary Trp for all measurements. For the main effects, birds raised at a low SD had greater (P < 0.01) body weight gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency than those raised at a high SD. However, supplementation of dietary Trp had no effect on broiler performance. Furthermore, there were no main effects of SD and dietary Trp on intestinal barrier functions. In conclusion, broiler chickens raised in a floor pen with a high SD (18 birds/) have decreased growth performance with little changes in intestinal barrier functions. Supplementation of dietary Trp at 0.16% has no positive effect on broiler chickens raised in a floor pen with either a low or high SD.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22194824>Cultivation of human corneal endothelial cells isolated from paired donor corneas.</a></h2><p>Consistent expansion of human corneal endothelial cells (hCECs) is critical in the development of tissue engineered endothelial constructs. However, a wide range of complex culture media, developed from different basal media have been reported in the propagation of hCECs, some with more success than others. These results are further confounded by donor-to-donor variability. The aim of this study is to evaluate four culture media in the isolation and propagation of hCECs isolated from a series of paired donor corneas in order to negate donor variability. Isolated primary hCECs were cultured in four previously published medium coded in this study as: M1-DMEM; -OptiMEM-I; M3-DMEM/F12, & M4-Ham's F12/M199. Primary hCECs established in these conditions were expanded for two passages and analyzed for (1) their propensity to adhere and proliferate; (2) their expression of characteristic corneal endothelium markers: Na+K+/ATPase and ZO-1; and (3) their cellular morphology throughout the study. We found that hCECs isolated in all four media showed rapid attachment when cultured on FNC-coated dishes. However, hCECs established in the four media exhibited different proliferation profiles with striking morphological differences. Corneal endothelial cells cultured in M1 and M3 could not be propagated beyond the first and second passage respectively. The hCECs cultured in  and M4 were significantly more proliferative and expressed markers characteristics of human corneal endothelium: Na+K+/ATPase and ZO-1. However, the unique morphological characteristics of cultivated hCECs were not maintained in either  or M4 beyond the third passage.The proliferative capacity and morphology of hCECs are vastly affected by the four culture media. For the development of tissue engineered graft materials using cultured hCECs derived from the isolation methodology described in this study, we propose the use of proliferative media  or M4 up to the third passage, or before the cultured hCECs lose their unique cellular morphology.</p></html>
