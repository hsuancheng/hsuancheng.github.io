The results showed that the  decrease rates of BBP, BBP-8, BBP-16, and BBP-24 were 77.48, 69.61, 56.87, and 52.89%, respectively. The antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of BBPs were decreased under gastrointestinal condition, which might be due to the variation of  during digestion. The bile acid-binding ability of BBPs showed an -dependent manner for higher  polysaccharides with higher viscosity. Through fermentation, the BBPs affected the ecosystem of the intestinal tract by promoting the production of short-chain fatty acids, lowering the pH of colon, and decreasing the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. All BBPs showed almost a similar modulation effect on the gut bacteria, but the lower  polysaccharide was more easily utilized by bacteria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667426>Oregano: A potential prophylactic treatment for the intestinal .</a></h1><p>Prophylactic use of antibiotics in poultry diets has been identified as a problematic practice because of its potential to exacerbate the spread of antibiotic resistance to human pathogens. A range of countries have opted to completely ban the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The animal production industries are looking for alternative ways to effectively control pathogens while providing the performance benefits previously secured by antibiotics in feed. Here, we present evidence that oregano () could be a potential alternative for pathogen control in the poultry industry. Broiler diets were supplemented with oregano powder (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2%) for six weeks. The capacity for pathogen control was estimated by  profiling of the jejunum, ileum, and caecum content, and in the faeces, by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The concentrations of short-chain fatty acids in the caecal content were also measured, as were villus/crypt parameters in the ileum. There were no differences among treatments in weight gain, feed intake, or the concentration of short-chain fatty acids. The height, width, and the surface area of villi in the ileum were not influenced by oregano addition. However, 1% and 2% of oregano produced a significant increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio. There were no visible histopathological changes in the liver in control and treated groups. Although oregano had no significant effect on overall microbial diversity and gross composition, some specific genera, like ,  and , which include known pathogens, were reduced in relative abundance by oregano treatment. , recognized as a beneficial and probiotic genus, was also suppressed by the oregano treatment.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681174>Effect of Metformin on Short-Term High-Fat Diet-Induced Weight Gain and Anxiety-Like Behavior and the Gut .</a></h1><p>The pathogenic factors of the complex epidemic disorder-obesity, have expanded from genetic background, endocrine factors, abnormal feeding behaviors, and direct neural control of adipose tissue physiology. As a chronic metabolic disease, it is important to find new potential therapeutic targets and locate a sensitive time window for intervention. In this study, we focus on the early stage of a high-fat diet mouse model: a short-term 3-week treatment. Our results showed that this short-term 3-week HFD can already induce significant body weight gain, increased adipocyte size and surprisingly, anxiety-like behavior of the animals. Then we tried the early intervention with metformin, already reported for its effects in long-term HFD induced obesity. For a short-term 3-week co-treatment, metformin alleviated the HFD-induced increase in body weight, the increase in adipocyte size and furthermore, the anxiety-like behavior. Differences were noted among the normal diet (ND), HFD, and HFD with metformin co-treatment groups in gut , including its composition and diversity. The possible involvement of gut  cannot be ruled out. Intense phospho-AMPK staining was found in the metformin treatment group in the habenular nuclei, hippocampus and basal ganglia of the brain compared with the HFD group, implying that the anxiolytic effect of metformin could be due to the direct activation of the AMPK pathway in the anxiety-related brain nuclei.Copyright © 2019 Ji, Wang and Li.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671720>The Human Milk  is Modulated by Maternal Diet.</a></h1><p>Human milk microorganisms contribute not only to the healthy development of the immune system in infants, but also in shaping the gut .

A total of 342, 26-d-old Cobb500 broilers were divided into 5 groups with 6 replicates. Treatments were as follows: (a) Low stocking density (L, 9 birds per cage); (b) High stocking density (H, 12 birds per cage); (c) H + 50 ppm NAM; (d) H + 500 ppm BA; (e) H + 50 ppm NAM + 500 ppm BA (COMB). The results showed that high stocking density significantly reduced the feed intake and body weight gain of broilers, while COMB improved the growth performance at high stocking density. High stocking density significantly reduced the liver metallothionein content, liver mitochondrial membrane potential and the activities of Na+K+-ATPase and Ca2+Mg2+-ATPase. In contrast, the liver metallothionein contents in the NAM, BA and COMB fed group were higher than those in the H group. COMB increased the activity of ATPase as well, but it failed to enhance the mitochondrial membrane potential. Stocking density also affected gut  of broilers. The high-density group increased the relative abundance of Blautia. Supplementation of BA and NAM increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria, respectively. In conclusion, a combination of NAM and BA can improve the performance, antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial function and intestinal  of broilers at high stocking density.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655872>Phyllosphere of Submerged Plants in Bathing Lakes as a Reservoir of Fungi-Potential Human Pathogens.</a></h1><p>This study analysed whether the littoral zone in the immediate vicinity of bathing sites retains potentially pathogenic yeasts on the phyllosphere surface and to what extent the species composition of microfungi in the phyllosphere and in surface waters is similar. The research was carried out in selected lakes located within the administrative boundaries of the city of Olsztyn, the largest city in the Masurian Lake District (NE Poland). The experiment was conducted in three summer seasons near bathing sites in three lakes, which are the most popular as recreational sites (Lake Kortowskie, Lake Tyrsko, and Lake Skanda). Microfungi isolated from the phyllosphere of 13 plant species of the littoral zone from dropped leaves of coast plants with no disease symptoms were used as the study material. The isolated fungi were identified in accordance with the accepted diagnostic procedures applied in mycological laboratories. A total of 36 yeast species of 16 genera were identified. Fungi found earlier at the bathing sites of the lakes were identified in 60% of the cases. Nine species were categorised as class BSL-2 fungi.

We then describe how this model is parameterized based on published  data. Finally, we investigate how treatment history affects the prevalence of resistance among opportunistic enterobacterial pathogens. We simulate treatment histories and identify which properties of prior antibiotic exposure are most influential in determining the prevalence of resistance. We find that resistance prevalence can be predicted by 3 properties, namely the total days of drug exposure, the duration of the drug-free period after last treatment, and the center of mass of the treatment pattern. Overall this work provides a framework for capturing the role of the microbiome in the selection of antibiotic resistance and highlights the role of treatment history for the prevalence of resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665423>Identification of Metagenomics Structure and Function Associated With Temporal Changes in Rat (Rattus norvegicus) Skin Microbiome During Health and Cutaneous Burn.</a></h1><p>The cutaneous skin microbiome is host to a vast ensemble of resident microbes that provide essential capabilities including protection of skin barrier integrity and modulation of the host immune response. Cutaneous burn-injury promotes alteration of cutaneous and systemic immune response that can affect both commensal and pathogenic microbes. A cross-sectional study of a limited number of burn patients revealed a difference in the bacteriome of burned versus control participants. Temporal changes of the skin microbiome during health and cutaneous burn-injury remains largely unknown. Furthermore, how this microbial shift relates to community function in the collective metagenome remain elusive. Due to cost considerations and reduced healing time, rodents are frequently used in burn research, despite inherent physiological differences between rodents and human skin. Using a rat burn model, a longitudinal study was conducted to characterize the rat skin bacterial residents and associated community functions in states of health (n = 30) (sham-burned) and when compromised by burn-injury (n = 24). To address the knowledge gap, traumatic thermal injury and disruption of cutaneous surface is associated with genus-level changes in the , reduced bacterial richness, and altered representation of bacterial genes and associated predicted functions across different skin microbial communities. These findings demonstrate that, upon burn-injury, there is a shift in diversity of the skin's organismal assemblages, yielding a core microbiome that is distinct at the genome and functional level. Moreover, deviations from the core community correlate with temporal changes post-injury and community transition from the state of cutaneous health to disease (burn-injury).© The Author(s) 2019.

Although the microbiome seems to be linked to all sorts of diseases, cancer has the biggest potential to be investigated. Following the publication of the National Institute of Health - Human Microbiome Project (NIH-HMP), the link between Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) and microbiome seems to be a fast-moving field in research area. However, robust evidence-based literature is still quite scarce. Nevertheless the relationship between oral microbiome and HNC could have important consequences for prevention and early detection of this type of tumors. The aims of the present review are: (i) to discuss current pre-clinical evidence of a role of oral microbiome in HNC; (ii) to report recent developments in understanding the human microbiome's relationship with HNC oncogenesis; (iii) to explore the issue of treatment response and treatment toxicity; (iv) to describe the role of  as potentially modifiable factor suitable for targeting by therapeutics. Further studies are needed to better establish the causal relationship between oral microbiome and HNC oncogenesis. Future trials should continue to explore oral microbiome in order to build the scientific and clinical rationale of HNC preventative and ameliorate treatment outcome.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Obesity in children is also on rise, indicating the urgent need of strategies for prevention and intervention that must begin in early life. While originally posited that obesity results from the simple concept of consuming more calories, or genetics, emerging research suggests that the bacteria living in our gut (gut microbiome) and its interactions with immune cells and metabolic organs including adipose tissues (microbiome-immune-metabolic axis) play significant role in obesity development in childhood. Specifically, abnormal changes (dysbiosis) in the gut microbiome, stimulation of inflammatory cytokines, and shifts in the metabolic functions of brown adipose tissue and the browning of white adipose tissue are associated with increased obesity. Many factors from as early as gestation appear to contribute in obesity, such as maternal health, diet, antibiotic use by mother and/or child, and birth and feeding methods. Herein, using evidence from animal and human studies, we discuss how these factors impact microbiome-immune-metabolic axis and cause obesity epidemic in children, and describe the gaps in knowledge that are warranted for future research.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670167>Reduction in pathogenic load of wheat by tempering with saline organic acid solutions at different seasonal temperatures.</a></h1><p>As a raw agricultural commodity, wheat is exposed to microbial contamination; therefore, enteric pathogens may be among its  creating a food safety risk in milled products. This research evaluates (1) the effectiveness of organic acids dissolved in saline solutions to reduce the counts of pathogenic microorganisms in soft and hard wheat, and also investigates the effect of seasonal temperature on (2) survivability of pathogens in wheat kernels and on (3) pathogen inactivation during tempering with saline organic acid solutions. Wheat samples were inoculated with cocktails of either 5 serovars of Salmonella enterica, 5 E. coli O157:H7 or 6 non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strains to achieve a concentration of ~7 log CFU/g. Inoculated samples were allowed to stand for 7-days at temperatures (2.0, 10.8, 24.2, 32 °C) corresponding to those experienced during winter, spring/fall, and summer (average and maximum) in the main wheat growing regions in the state of Nebraska, USA. Besides water, solutions containing acid (acetic or lactic 2.5% or 5.0% v/v) and NaCl (~26% w/v) were used for tempering the wheat to 15.0% (soft) and 15.5% (hard) moisture at the different seasonal temperatures. The survival of pathogenic microorganisms throughout the resting period, and before and after tempering was analyzed by plating samples on injury-recovery media. The survival rate of pathogenic microorganisms on wheat kernels was higher at temperatures experienced during the winter (2.0 °C) and spring/fall (10.8 °C) months. Regardless of tempering temperature, the initial pathogen load was reduced significantly by all solutions when compared to the control tempered with water (P ≤ .05). The combination of lactic acid (5.0%) and NaCl was the most effective treatment against Salmonella enterica, E. coli O157:H7 and non-O157 STEC, with average reduction values of 1.8, 1.8 and 1.6 log CFU/g for soft wheat and 2.6, 2.4 and 2.4 log CFU/g for hard wheat, respectively. Implementation of organic acids and NaCl in tempering water may have the potential to reduce the risk of pathogen contamination in milled products.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Antibiotics perturb the bacterial gut composition but the extent of these changes and potential consequences for animal and human health is still debated. Six calves were housed in a controlled environment. Three animals received an injection of the antibiotic florfenicol (Nuflor), and three received no treatment. Faecal samples were collected at 0, 3 and 7 days, and bacterial communities were profiled to assess the impact of a therapy on the gut . Phylogenetic analysis (16S-rDNA) established that at day 7, antibiotic-treated  showed a 10-fold increase in facultative anaerobic Escherichia spp, a signature of imbalanced , dysbiosis. The antibiotic resistome showed a high background of antibiotic resistance genes, which did not significantly change in response to florfenicol. However, the maintenance of Escherichia coli plasmid-encoded quinolone, oqxB and propagation of mcr-2, and colistin resistance genes were observed and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The  of treated animals was enriched with energy harvesting bacteria, common to obese microbial communities. We propose that antibiotic treatment of healthy animals leads to unbalanced, disease- and obese-related  that promotes growth of E. coli carrying resistance genes on mobile elements, potentially increasing the risk of transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria to humans.© 2019 The Authors.

PHT is an important driver of hepatic decompensation such as development of ascites or variceal bleeding. Dysbiosis and an impaired intestinal barrier in ACLD facilitate translocation of bacteria and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that promote disease progression  immune system activation with subsequent induction of proinflammatory and profibrogenic pathways. Congestive portal venous blood flow represents a critical pathophysiological mechanism linking PHT to increased intestinal permeability: The intestinal barrier function is affected by impaired microcirculation, neoangiogenesis, and abnormal vascular and mucosal permeability. The close bidirectional relationship between the gut and the liver has been termed "gut-liver axis". Treatment strategies targeting the gut-liver axis by modulation of  composition and function, intestinal barrier integrity, as well as amelioration of liver fibrosis and PHT are supposed to exert beneficial effects. The activation of the farnesoid X receptor in the liver and the gut was associated with beneficial effects in animal experiments, however, further studies regarding efficacy and safety of pharmacological FXR modulation in patients with ACLD are needed. In this review, we summarize the clinical impact of PHT on the course of liver disease, discuss the underlying pathophysiological link of PHT to gut-liver axis signaling, and provide insight into molecular mechanisms that may represent novel therapeutic targets.©The Author(s) 2019.

We employed RNA sequencing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to profile gene expression in blood and the composition of the fecal  in infants born at <29 weeks gestational age and diagnosed with BPD in comparison to those of preterm infants that were not diagnosed with BPD. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, performed longitudinally on 255 fecal samples collected from 50 infants in the first months of life, identified significant differences in the relative levels of abundance of , and  in the BPD infants in a manner that was birth mode dependent. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis revealed that more than 400 genes were upregulated in infants with BPD. Genes upregulated in BPD infants were significantly enriched for functions related to red blood cell development and oxygen transport, while several immune-related pathways were downregulated. We also identified a gene expression signature consistent with an enrichment of immunosuppressive CD71 early erythroid cells in infants with BPD. Intriguingly, genes that were correlated in their expression with the relative abundances of specific taxa in the  were significantly enriched for roles in the immune system, suggesting that changes in the  might influence immune gene expression systemically. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious inflammatory condition of the lung and is the most common complication associated with preterm birth. A large body of evidence now suggests that the gut  can influence immunity and inflammation systemically; however, the role of the gut  in BPD has not been evaluated to date. Here, we report that there are significant differences in the gut  of infants born at <29 weeks gestation and subsequently diagnosed with BPD, which are particularly pronounced when infants are stratified by birth mode. We also show that erythroid and immune gene expression levels are significantly altered in BPD infants.

The GM is well-known to be involved in the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism of OMVs is not clear. In the present study, we demonstrated the involvement of OMVs in the development of cognitive (learning and memory) dysfunction induced by blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. More important, further study showed that OMVs induced tau phosphorylation by activating glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) in the hippocampus. OMVs activated astrocytes and microglia, increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines (nuclear factor κB, interleukin-1β, and tumour necrosis factor-α) in the hippocampus. Therefore, OMVs increase the permeability of the BBB and promote the activation of astrocytes and microglia, inducing an inflammatory response and tau hyperphosphorylation by activating the GSK-3β pathway and finally leading to cognitive impairment.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669435>Untargeted Metabolomic Profiling Identifies Disease-specific Signatures in Food Allergy and Asthma.</a></h1><p>Food allergy (FA) affects an increasing proportion of children. for reasons that remain obscure. Novel disease biomarkers and curative treatment options are strongly needed.To apply untargeted metabolomic profiling to identify pathogenic mechanisms and candidate disease biomarkers in FA.Mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomic profiling was performed on serum samples of children with either FA alone, asthma alone or both FA and asthma as well as healthy pediatric controls.In this pilot study FA subjects exhibited a disease-specific metabolomic signature as compared to both control subjects and asthmatics. In particular, FA was uniquely associated with a marked decrease in sphingolipids, as well as a number of other lipid metabolites, in the face of normal frequencies of circulating natural killer T (NKT) cells. Specific comparison of FA and asthmatic subjects revealed differences in the -sensitive aromatic amino acid and secondary bile acid metabolism. Children with both FA and asthma exhibited a metabolomic profile that aligned with that of FA alone but not asthma. Among children with FA, history of severe systemic reactions and presence of multiple FA were associated with changes in tryptophan metabolites, eicosanoids, plasmalogens, and fatty acids.Children with FA display a disease-specific metabolomic profile that is informative of disease mechanisms and severity, and which dominates in the presence of asthma. Lower levels of sphingolipids and ceramides and other metabolomic alterations observed in FA children may reflect the interplay between an altered  and immune cell subsets in the gut.Copyright © 2019.

It is usually diagnosed clinically by direct detection of an abnormal pattern of the intestinal . The intermediate diagnosis based on determining the content of microflora metabolites, considered as chemical markers of this disorder, is still rarely used. This is, among others, due to the variety of properties of compounds recognised as dysbiosis markers and as a consequence, the use of different methods for their analysis. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no analytical procedure that would allow unambiguous determination of all compounds in one procedure. In the present study, we have established a detailed method for the quantitative analysis of hydrocinnamic, citramalic, p-hydroxybenzeneacetic, tartaric, hippuric, 4-hydroxybenzoic, indoxylsulfuric, tricarballylic, 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic and benzoic acids along with DL-arabitol that employs the direct derivatization of compounds in a small volume of urine sample followed by gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). To show that the optimised method is a useful tool for chemical diagnosis of dysbiosis, it was applied for determination of the dysbiosis markers in the authentic urine samples.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Because the pathogenic factors of DM are heterogeneous, determining clinically effective treatments for DM patients is difficult. Applying various nutrient analyses has yielded new insight and potential treatments for DM patients. In this review, we summarized the omics analysis methods, including nutrigenomics, nutritional-metabolomics, and foodomics. The list of the new targets of SNPs, genes, proteins, and gut  associated with DM has been obtained by the analysis of nutrigenomics and microbiomics within last few years, which provides a reference for the diagnosis of DM. The use of nutrient metabolomics analysis can obtain new targets of amino acids, lipids, and metal elements, which provides a reference for the treatment of DM. Foodomics analysis can provide targeted dietary strategies for DM patients. This review summarizes the DM-associated molecular biomarkers in current applied omics analyses and may provide guidance for diagnosing and treating DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681210>Lactic Acid Treatment of Cereals and Dietary Phytase Modified Fecal Microbiome Composition Without Affecting Expression of Virulence Factor Genes in Growing Pigs.</a></h1><p>Besides the major nutrients, phosphorus (P) is an essential mineral for both the host animal and the porcine gut . Different strategies including phytase supplementation and more recently lactic acid (LA) are used to enhance the P availability from cereals in pig diets; however, their impact on the gut  has been rarely related to fecal shedding of opportunistic pathogens. The present study investigated the effect of phytase supplementation and the treatment of dietary cereals with 2.5% LA on the fecal microbiome composition of metabolic active bacteria and expression of virulence factor genes of enterotoxigenic  and  in growing pigs. Phytase supplementation reduced the fecal abundance of the most abundant  family, whereas the LA-treatment of cereals had a stronger impact on the bacterial community, reducing amylolytic, pullulanolytic and hemicellulolytic ,  and  as well as the fecal bacterial species richness (Chao1) and diversity (Shannon index). Mainly the family  benefited from the decline in the aforementioned families, being enriched by both dietary treatments. Multigroup data integration using sparse partial least squares-discriminant analysis showed that among the most discriminative operational taxonomic units (OTU) especially two unclassified -OTUs, one -like OTU and one OTU within the  group were associated with calcium and P levels but were negatively linked with complex carbohydrates in feces. Heat-stable toxin A () of enterotoxigenic  and  of Shiga-toxin producing  were expressed in feces but were similar among feeding groups. Without modifying the total bacterial gene copies and virulence factor expression of , both dietary phytase supplementation and LA-treatment of cereals drastically altered the bacterial community composition in pig feces. Results thereby allowed for the characterization of bacterial nutrient dependencies, indicating a link between fecal P availability, complex carbohydrate composition and alterations in the predominant genera.Copyright © 2019 Klinsoda, Vötterl, Zebeli and Metzler-Zebeli.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683407>[The analysis of the relationship between the fungal  from soil and tongue coating of 18 patients with precancerous lesions of upper gastrointestinal].</a></h1><p>The fungal  from self-retained soil and tongue coating of 18 patients with precancerous lesions of upper gastrointestinal (PLUG) were sequenced.

To what extent environmental influences affect the differential distribution of these microbial populations may therefore significantly impact the successful farming of the host. Using a sea-based container culture (SBCC) system for the on-growing of European lobster (Homarus gammarus), we tracked the bacterial gut  over a 1-year period. We compared these communities with lobsters of the same cohort, retained in a land-based culture (LBC) system to assess the effects of the culture environment on gut bacterial assemblage and describe the phylogenetic structure of the  to compare deterministic and stochastic assembly across both environments. Bacterial gut communities from SBCCs were generally more phylogenetically clustered, and therefore deterministically assembled, compared to those reared in land-based systems. Lobsters in SBCCs displayed significantly more species-rich and species-diverse gut  compared to those retained in LBC. A reduction in the bacterial diversity of the gut was also associated with higher infection prevalence of the enteric viral pathogen Homarus gammarus nudivirus (HgNV). SBCCs may therefore benefit the overall health of the host by promoting the assembly of a more diverse gut bacterial community and reducing the susceptibility to disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659451>Anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047 on high-fat and high-fructose diet mice base on inflammatory response alleviation and gut  regulation.</a></h1><p>The objective of the study was to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047, and illustrate the potential functional mechanism about the alleviation of high fat and high fructose diet (HFFD) induced obesity and related metabolic abnormalities.C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a standard or HFFD with or without supplementation of L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 for 10 weeks. Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut  composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut  variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut  by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut , which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656993>The gut  to the brain axis in the metabolic control.</a></h1><p>The regulation of glycemia is under a tight neuronal detection of glucose levels performed by the gut-brain axis and an efficient efferent neuronal message sent to the peripheral organs, as the pancreas to induce insulin and inhibit glucagon secretions.

However, the effects of gut  on insect immunity remain mostly elusive. Red palm weevil (RPW),  Olivier, is a destructive pest of palm trees worldwide, which has forged alliances with its gut . Here, we found that the aposymbiotic insects succumbed at a significantly faster rate than conventionally reared (CR) ones upon bacterial infection. Physiological assays confirmed that CR insects had stronger antimicrobial activity and higher phenoloxidase activity in contrast to germfree (GF) ones, indicating that the systemic immune responses of GF individuals were compromised markedly. Interestingly, under the bacterial challenge conditions, the reassociation of gut  with GF insects could enhance their survival rate by rescuing their immunocompetence. Furthermore, comparative transcriptome analysis uncovered that 35 immune-related genes, including pathogen recognition receptors, effectors and immune signaling pathway, were significantly downregulated in GF insects as compared to CR ones. Collectively, our findings corrobate that intestinal commensal bacteria have profound immunostimulatory effects on RPW larvae. Therefore, knowledge on the effects of gut  on RPW immune defenses may contribute to of set up efficient control strategies of this pest.Copyright © 2019 Muhammad, Habineza, Ji, Hou and Shi.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657333>[Fecal  transplantation regulates the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in cerebral cortex of septic rats through intestinal ].</a></h1><p>To investigate the effects of fecal  transplantation on septic gut flora and the cortex cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in rats.Sixty clean grade male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into normal saline (NS) control group, sepsis model group and fecal  transplantation group by random number table, with 20 rats in each group. The rat model of sepsis was reproduced by injection of 10 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via tail vein, the rats in the NS control group was given the same amount of NS. The rats in the fecal  transplantation group received nasogastric infusion of feces from healthy donor on the 1st day, 2 mL each time, for 3 times a day, the other two groups were given equal dose of NS by gavage. Fecal samples were collected on the 7th day after modeling, the levels of intestinal  composition was determined using the 16SrDNA gene sequencing technology. The brain function was evaluated by electroencephalogram (EEG), and the proportion of each waveform in EEG was calculated. After sacrifice of rats, the brain tissues were harvested, the levels of protein expression of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) were determined by Western Blot, and positive cells of Iba-1 in brain tissue were detected by immunohistochemistry method. The levels of interleukins (IL-6 and IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Seven days after the reproduction of the model, all rats in the NS control group survived, while 10 rats and 8 rats died in the sepsis model group and fecal  transplantation group, respectively, with mortality rates of 50% and 40% respectively. Finally, there were 20 rats in the NS control group, 10 in the sepsis model group and 12 in the fecal  transplantation group.

The microbial composition of the human gut  is modulated by diet and other lifestyle habits and it has been reported that microbial diversity is altered in obese people. Obesity is a worldwide health problem that negatively impacts the quality of life. Currently, the widespread treatment for obesity is bariatric surgery. Interestingly, gut  has been shown to be a relevant factor in effective weight loss after bariatric surgery. Since that the human gut  of normal subjects differs between geographic regions, it is possible that rearrangements of the gut  in dysbiosis context are also region-specific. To better understand how gut  contribute to obesity, this study compared the composition of the human gut  of obese and lean people from six different regions and showed that the  compositions in the context of obesity were specific to each studied geographic location. Furthermore, we analyzed the functional patterns using shotgun DNA metagenomic sequencing and compared the results with other obesity-related metagenomic studies, we observed that microbial contribution to functional pathways were country-specific. Nevertheless, our study showed that although microbial composition of obese patients was country-specific, the overall metabolic functions appeared to be the same between countries, indicating that different  components contribute to similar metabolic outcomes to yield functional redundancy. Furthermore, we studied the  functional changes of obese patients after bariatric surgery, by shotgun metagenomics sequencing and observed that changes in functional pathways were specific to the type of obesity treatment. In all, our study provides new insights into the differences and similarities of obese gut  in relation to geographic location and obesity treatments.Copyright © 2019 Medina, Li, Thomson, Artacho, Pérez-Brocal and Moya.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680682> Analysis Using Two-step PCR and Next-generation 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing.</a></h1><p>The human gut is colonized by trillions of bacteria that support physiologic functions such as food metabolism, energy harvesting, and regulation of the immune system. Perturbation of the healthy gut microbiome has been suggested to play a role in the development of inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Environmental and genetic factors can influence the composition of the microbiome; therefore, identification of microbial communities linked with a disease phenotype has become the first step towards defining the microbiome's role in health and disease. Use of 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing for profiling bacterial community has helped in advancing microbiome research. Despite its wide use, there is no uniform protocol for 16S rRNA-based taxonomic profiling analysis. Another limitation is the low resolution of taxonomic assignment due to technical difficulties such as smaller sequencing reads, as well as use of only forward (R1) reads in the final analysis due to low quality of reverse (R2) reads. There is need for a simplified method with high resolution to characterize bacterial diversity in a given biospecimen. Advancements in sequencing technology with the ability to sequence longer reads at high resolution have helped to overcome some of these challenges. Present sequencing technology combined with a publicly available metagenomic analysis pipeline such as R-based Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm-2 (DADA2) has helped advance microbial profiling at high resolution, as DADA2 can assign sequence at the genus and species levels. Described here is a guide for performing bacterial profiling using two-step amplification of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, followed by analysis using freely available analysis tools (i.e., DADA2, Phyloseq, and METAGENassist). It is believed that this simple and complete workflow will serve as an excellent tool for researchers interested in performing microbiome profiling studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659726>Growth and Nutrition in Cystic Fibrosis.</a></h1><p>Optimal nutrition support has been integral in the management of cystic fibrosis (CF) since the disease was initially described. Nutritional status has a clear relationship with disease outcomes, and malnutrition in CF is typically a result of chronic negative energy balance secondary to malabsorption. As the mechanisms underlying the pathology of CF and its implications on nutrient absorption and energy expenditure have been elucidated, nutrition support has become increasingly sophisticated. Comprehensive nutrition monitoring and treatment guidelines from professional and advocacy organizations have unified the approach to nutrition optimization around the world. Newborn screening allows for early nutrition intervention and improvement in short- and long-term growth and other clinical outcomes. The nutrition support goal in CF care includes achieving optimal nutritional status to support growth and pubertal development in children, maintenance of optimal nutritional status in adult life, and optimizing fat soluble vitamin and essential fatty acid status. The mainstay of this approach is a high calorie, high-fat diet, exceeding age, and sex energy intake recommendations for healthy individuals. For patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, enzyme replacement therapy is required to improve fat and calorie absorption. Enzyme dosing varies by age and dietary fat intake. Multiple potential impediments to absorption, including decreased motility, altered gut luminal bile salt and  composition, and enteric inflammation must be considered. Fat soluble vitamin supplementation is required in patients with pancreatic insufficiency. In this report, nutrition support across the age and disease spectrum is discussed, with a focus on the relationships among nutritional status, growth, and disease outcomes.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655861> Associated with Dromedary Camel Milk from Algerian Sahara.</a></h1><p>Despite the fact that camel milk represents a valuable food source, the fungal diversity of raw camel milk has been poorly studied so far.

Its presence within the animal and human intestinal  was correlated with immunomodulatory effects, mediated by both propionibacterial surface components and by secreted metabolites. It is widely implemented, both in the manufacture of fermented dairy products such as Swiss-type cheeses, and in the production of probiotic food complements, under the form of freeze-dried powders. The bottleneck of this drying process consists in the limited survival of bacteria during drying and storage. Protective pre-treatments have been applied to other bacteria and may, in a strain-dependent manner, confer enhanced resistance. However, very little information was yet published on  adaptation to freeze-drying. In this report, an immunomodulatory strain of this probiotic bacterium was cultured under hyperosmotic constraint in order to trigger osmoadaptation. This adaptation was then combined with acid or thermal pre-treatment. Such combination led to accumulation of key stress proteins, of intracellular compatible solute glycine betaine, to modulation of the propionibacterial membrane composition, and to enhanced survival upon freeze-drying.

Enterococcal infections, mainly caused by Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, include apical periodontitis, endocarditis, and bloodstream infections. Recently, vancomycinresistant Enterococci are considered major pathogens that are common but difficult to treat, especially in nosocomial settings. Moreover, E. faecalis is closely associated with recurrent endodontic infections and failed endodontic treatment. In this study, we investigated the effects of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which are metabolites fermented by gut , on the growth of Enterococci. Enterococci were cultured in the presence or absence of acetate, propionate, or butyrate, and the optical density at 600 nm was measured to determine bacterial growth. The minimum inhibitory concentration/minimum bactericidal concentration test was conducted. Bacteria were treated with a SCFA, together with clinically used endodontic treatment methods such as triple antibiotics (metronidazole, minocycline, and ciprofloxacin) and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) to determine the effects of combination treatment. Of the SCFAs, propionate had a bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of E. faecalis in a dose-dependent manner and also that of clinical strains of E. faecalis isolated from dental plaques. Meanwhile, acetate and butyrate had minimal effects on E. faecalis growth. Moreover, propionate inhibited the growth of other Enterococci including E. faecium. In addition, combination treatment of propionate and triple antibiotics led to further growth inhibition, whereas no cooperative effect was observed at propionate plus CHX. These results indicate that propionate attenuates the growth of Enterococci, suggesting propionate as a potential agent to control Enterococcal infections, especially when combined with triple antibiotics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666311>Incidence of necrotising enterocolitis before and after introducing routine prophylactic  and  probiotics.</a></h1><p>To compare rates of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), late-onset sepsis, and mortality in 5-year epochs before and after implementation of routine daily multistrain probiotics administration in high-risk neonates.Single-centre retrospective observational study over the 10-year period from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2017.Level 3 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, UK.Preterm neonates at high risk of NEC: admitted to NICU within 3 days of birth at <32 weeks' gestation or at 32-36 weeks' gestation and of birth weight <1500 g.Prior to 1 January 2013 probiotics were not used. Thereafter, dual-species  and  combination probiotics were routinely administered daily to high-risk neonates; from April 2016 triple-species probiotics (    and   subspecies ) were used.Incidence of NEC (modified Bell's stage 2a or greater), late-onset sepsis, and mortality.Rates of NEC fell from 7.5% (35/469 neonates) in the pre-implementation epoch to 3.1% (16/513 neonates) in the routine probiotics epoch (adjusted sub-hazard ratio=0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.85, p=0.014). The more than halving of NEC rates after probiotics introduction was independent of any measured covariates, including breast milk feeding rates. Cases of late-onset sepsis fell from 106/469 (22.6%) to 59/513 (11.5%) (p<0.0001), and there was no episode of sepsis due to  or . All-cause mortality also fell in the routine probiotics epoch, from 67/469 (14.3%) to 47/513 (9.2%), although this was not statistically significant after multivariable adjustment (adjusted sub-hazard ratio=0.74, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.12, p=0.155).Administration of multispecies  and  probiotics has been associated with a significantly decreased risk of NEC and late-onset sepsis in our neonatal unit, and no safety issues. Our data are consistent with routine use of  and  combination probiotics having a beneficial effect on NEC prevention in very preterm neonates.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

An obstacle to understanding this contradiction has been a shortage of in vivo models reproducing the unique structure and immunology of human skin. In this work, we developed a humanized model to study how healthy adult human skin responds to colonizing methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). We demonstrate the importance of the outer stratum corneum as the major site of bacterial colonization and how noninvasive MRSA adhesion to corneocytes induces a local inflammatory response in underlying skin layers. This signaling recruits neutrophils to the skin, where they control bacterial numbers, mediating transiency in colonization. This work highlights the spatiotemporal aspects of human skin colonization and demonstrates a subclinical inflammatory response to noninvasive MRSA that allows human skin to regulate the bacterial population at its outer surface.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

A dual-plasmid sensor system responding to isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside was developed and fully characterised in vitro. Subsequently, we show the sensor was capable of detecting and reporting on changes in the intestinal environment of C. elegans after introducing exogenous inducer into the environment. The protocols presented here may be used for aiding the rational design of engineered bacterial circuits, primarily for diagnostic applications.

After 24-h treatment, pigs were monitored to assess feed intake (FI), and samples of serum and feces were collected to investigate serum profile, microbial composition, and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The results showed that HS decreased (P < 0.05) FI compared with the TN group. Compared with TN group, HS changed serum profile by affecting biochemical parameters and hormones related with energy metabolism and stress response; immune indicators were also altered in HS group. Most of changes in serum profile were independent of FI reduction. Additionally, HS shifted the diversity and composition of fecal microbial community by increasing (P < 0.05) Proteobacteria and decreasing (P < 0.05) Bacteroidetes. Moreover, HS decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of propionate, butyrate, valerate, iso-valerate, and total SCFAs in feces with a FI-independent manner. Furthermore, the Spearman correlation analysis implied that changes of serum profile have potential correlation with alterations of fecal  and their metabolites SCFAs in acute HS-treated grow-finishing pigs.Metabolism disorders caused by 24-h acute HS associated with changes of fecal  and their metabolites SCFAs with a FI-independent manner in grow-finishing pigs.These results give us a new insight of the intestinal damage caused by acute HS and the underlying mechanisms.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673418>Cartilage-gut-microbiome axis: a new paradigm for novel therapeutic opportunities in osteoarthritis.</a></h1><p>DNA of gut  can be found in synovium of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. This finding could result from the translocation of still alive bacteria from gut to joints through blood, since the diversified dormant  of healthy human blood can be transiently resuscitated in vitro. The recent finding of gut microbiome in human cartilage, which differed between osteoarthritis and controls, suggests that a similar trafficking of dead or alive bacteria from gut  physiologically occurs between gut and epiphysial bone marrow. Subchondral  could enhance cartilage healing and transform components of deep cartilage matrix in metabolites with immunosuppressive properties. The differences of microbiome observed between hip and knee cartilage, either in osteoarthritis or controls, might be the counterpart of subtle differences in chondrocyte metabolism, themselves in line with differences in DNA methylation according to joints. Although bacteria theoretically cannot reach chondrocytes from the surface of intact cartilage, some bacteria enter the vascular channels of the epiphysial growth cartilage in young animals, whereas others can infect chondrocytes in vitro. In osteoarthritis, the early osteochondral plate angiogenesis may further enhance the ability of  to locate close to the deeper layers of cartilage, and this might lead to focal dysbiosis, low-grade inflammation, cartilage degradation, epigenetic changes in chondrocytes and worsening of osteoarthritis. More studies on cartilage across different ethnic groups, weights, and according to age, are needed, to confirm the silent presence of gut  close to human cartilage and better understand its physiologic and pathogenic significance.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Iron fortificants adversely affect the infant gut , while co-provision of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) mitigates most of the adverse effects. Whether variations in maternal HMO profile can influence the infant response to iron and/or GOS fortificants is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine HMO profiles and the secretor/non-secretor phenotype of lactating Kenyan mothers and investigate their effects on the maternal and infant gut , and on the infant response to a fortification intervention with 5 mg iron (2.5 mg as sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate and 2.5 mg as ferrous fumarate) and 7.5 g GOS. We studied mother-infant pairs ( = 80) participating in a 4-month intervention trial in which the infants (aged 6.5-9.5 months) received daily a micronutrient powder without iron, with iron or with iron and GOS. We assessed: (1) maternal secretor status and HMO composition; (2) effects of secretor status on the maternal and infant gut  in a cross-sectional analysis at baseline of the intervention trial; and (3) interactions between secretor status and intervention groups during the intervention trial on the infant gut , gut inflammation, iron status, growth and infectious morbidity. Secretor prevalence was 72% and HMOs differed between secretors and non-secretors and over time of lactation. Secretor status did not predict the baseline composition of the maternal and infant gut . There was a secretor-status-by-intervention-group interaction on  ( = 0.021), Z-scores for length-for-age ( = 0.022) and weight-for-age ( = 0.018), and soluble transferrin receptor ( = 0.041). In the no iron group, longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea was higher among infants of non-secretors (23.8%) than of secretors (10.4%) ( = 0.001). In conclusion, HMO profile may modulate the infant gut  response to fortificant iron; compared to infants of secretor mothers, infants of non-secretor mothers may be more vulnerable to the adverse effect of iron but also benefit more from the co-provision of GOS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669656>A method to assess bioavailability of antibiotics in anthropogenic polluted ecosystems by using a bacterial fitness test.</a></h1><p>Antibiotics released in the environment exert a selective pressure on the resident . It is well accepted that the mere measurement of antibiotics does not reflect the actual bioavailability. In fact, antibiotics can be adsorbed or complexed to particles and/or chemicals in water and soil. Bioavailable concentrations of antibiotics in soil and water are subjected to great uncertainty, therefore biological assays are increasingly recognized as that allow an indirect determination of the residual antibiotic activity. Here we propose how a fitness test for bacteria can be used to qualitatively assess the bioavailability of a specific antibiotic in the environment. The findings show that by using a pair of resistant and sensitive bacterial strains, the resulting fitness can indirectly reflect antibiotic bioavailability. Hence, this test can be used as a complementary assay to other biological and chemical tests to assess bioavailability of antibiotics.Copyright © 2018.

The commensal  is known to contribute to IgA production in the gut; however, the role of dietary antigens in IgA production is poorly understood. To understand the effect of dietary antigens on IgA production, post-weaning mice were maintained on an elemental diet without any large immunogenic molecules. We found that dietary antigens contribute to IgA production in PPs through induction of follicular helper T cells and germinal center B cells. The role of dietary antigens in the PP responses was further confirmed by adding bovine serum albumin (BSA) into the elemental diet. Although dietary antigens are important for PP responses, they have fewer effects than the  on the development and maturation of ILFs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that dietary antigens are essential for a normal antigen-specific IgA response to  serovar Typhimurium infection.

Vancomycin, the antimicrobial agent usually used to treat bacterial nosocomial infections, is associated with gut dysbiosis. As a lung-gut immunologic axis has been described, this study aimed to evaluate both the immunologic and histopathologic effects on the lungs and the large intestine resulting from vancomycin-induced gut dysbiosis in the P. aeruginosa pneumonia murine model. Metagenomic analysis demonstrated that vancomycin-induced gut dysbiosis resulted in higher Proteobacteria and lower Bacteroidetes populations in feces. Given that gut dysbiosis could augment the proinflammatory status of the intestines leading to a variety of acute inflammatory diseases, bone marrow-derived macrophages were stimulated with cecal content from dysbiotic mice showing a higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines and lower expression of IL-10. Dysbiotic mice showed higher levels of viable bacteria in the lungs and spleen when acutely infected with P. aeruginosa, with more lung and cecal damage and increased IL-10 expression in bronchoalveolar lavage. The susceptible and tissue damage phenotype was reversed when dysbiotic mice received fecal  transplantation. In spite of higher recruitment of CD11b+ cells in the lungs, there was no higher CD80+ expression, DC+ cell amounts or proinflammatory cytokine expression. Taken together, our results indicate that the bacterial community found in vancomycin-induced dysbiosis dysregulates the gut inflammatory status, influencing the lung-gut immunologic axis to favor increased opportunistic infections, for example, by P. aeruginosa.©2019 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659420>Effects of sialylated lactulose on the mouse intestinal microbiome using Illumina high-throughput sequencing.</a></h1><p>Sialylated oligosaccharides are known to have beneficial effects, such as increasing the level of bifidobacteria, reducing the levels of blood endotoxin and blood ammonia, and enhancing the body's immune system. However, it is unknown whether sialylated lactuloses have modulatory effects on the intestinal . In this study, 60 healthy mice were randomly divided into six groups, namely, a normal control group, a lactulose group, a Kdn-α2,3-lactulose group, a Kdn-α2,6-lactulose group, a Neu5Ac-α2,3-lactulose group, and a Neu5Ac-α2,6-lactulose group. After 14 days of lactulose administration, the feces of three mice from each group were collected, and the intestinal  were detected by Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S rDNA gene. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Firmicutes was increased in the sialylated lactulose groups, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes was decreased. At the family level, sialylated lactulose intervention decreased the relative abundance of Bacteroidales S24-7 group and Helicobacteraceae and enhanced the abundance of Lactobacillaceae, which reflects the modulatory effect of sialylated lactulose on intestinal . Diversity analysis indicated that the index of Chao was higher in the sialylated lactulose groups than in the normal control group, and the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices were higher in the Kdnα-2,6-lactulose group and the Neu5Ac-α2,3-lactulose group than in the normal control group. The results of the intestinal  sample composition indicated that there were differences between the sialylated lactulose groups and the normal control group. Thus, sialylated lactulose could be used as a functional food component with potential therapeutic applications in manipulating intestinal  to exert beneficial effects on the host's health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660868>Aging progression of human gut .</a></h1><p>Human gut  are important for human health and have been regarded as a "forgotten organ", whose variation is closely linked with various factors, such as host genetics, diet, pathological conditions and external environment. The diversity of human gut  has been correlated with aging, which was characterized by different abundance of bacteria in various age groups. In the literature, most of the previous studies of age-related gut  changes focused on individual species in the gut community with supervised methods. Here, we aimed to examine the underlying aging progression of the human gut microbial community from an unsupervised perspective.We obtained raw 16S rRNA sequencing data of subjects ranging from newborns to centenarians from a previous study, and summarized the data into a relative abundance matrix of genera in all the samples. Without using the age information of samples, we applied an unsupervised algorithm to recapitulate the underlying aging progression of microbial community from hosts in different age groups and identify genera associated to this progression. Literature review of these identified genera indicated that for individuals with advanced ages, some beneficial genera are lost while some genera related with inflammation and cancer increase.The multivariate unsupervised analysis here revealed the existence of a continuous aging progression of human gut  along with the host aging process. The identified genera associated to this aging process are meaningful for designing probiotics to maintain the gut  to resemble a young age, which hopefully will lead to positive impact on human health, especially for individuals in advanced age groups.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678982>Fecal  Taxonomic Shifts in Chinese Multiple Myeloma Patients Analyzed by Quantitative Polimerase Chain Reaction (QPCR) and 16S rRNA High-Throughput Sequencing.</a></h1><p>BACKGROUND Increasing evidence has suggested that gut flora play an important role in tumor progression and prognosis. However, the relationship between fecal  and hematologic malignancy requires further investigation. This study aimed to characterize the relationship of the fecal microbial community in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 40 MM patients and healthy controls (n=17) were retrospectively collected from the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University between October 2018 and May 2019. The fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing for the fecal microbial community, as well as diversity and correlation analysis. Furthermore, 21 MM patients and their family members were selected for the matched pair analysis to confirm the fecal  taxonomic changes by qRT-PCR assay. RESULTS Diversity analysis showed that diversity measured by Shannon index was lower in MM patients compared with healthy controls. At the phylum level, higher abundances of Proteobacteria but lower abundances of Actinobacteria were identified in the MM group in comparison with the healthy control group. At the genus level, the proportion of Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Roseburia was significantly higher in the MM group. The matched pair analysis showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Faecalibacterium were significantly more abundant in the MM group. Further analysis on prognostic risk factors revealed that the Faecalibacterium prausnitzii level was significantly correlated with ISS stage. CONCLUSIONS Our study highlights the imbalanced composition and diversity of the gastrointestinal microbiome in MM patients, which could be further used as a potential biomarker for MM risk screening, therapeutic strategies, and prognostic prediction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680787>The Duplex Interaction of Microbiome with Chemoradiation and Immunotherapy: Potential Implications for Colorectal Cancer.</a></h1><p>Gut  has the ability to modify the metabolism of wide array of therapeutic drugs. Current treatment modalities used in colorectal cancer have a narrow therapeutic index with a side effects profile that decreases tolerance to these treatments and adversely affects treatment outcome. Harnessing the gut  ability to modify oncotherapeutic drugs metabolism and hence efficacy, could be potentially used to improve treatment outcomes in colorectal cancer patients. This review will shed lights on important findings from recent microbiome interaction studies which would hopefully serve as a useful tool to guide future translative colorectal cancer research.Recent advances in microbiome studies have revealed an interesting aspect of gut microbes carcinogenic properties in dysbiotic gut environment.  niche in colorectal cancer can also modify efficacy and toxicity profile of different oncotherapeutic treatment modalities from chemoradiotherapy to immunotherapy. Conversely, each of these treatment modalities has numerous effects on the gastrointestinal flora, causing changes in the gut microbial community that affects host morbidity and mortality.Symbiotic gut  is an incredible functioning organ that maintains essential aspects of our homeostasis and immunity. According to the recent body of literature, they also can modify efficacy of many therapeutic drugs including oncotherapy. Considering that unexplainable variable treatment outcomes as well as variable tolerance to treatment have been observed in colorectal cancer patients, studying gut  modulatory effects on oncotherapy might be a feasible approach to explain this phenomenon.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659582>Age-related compositional and functional changes in micro-pig gut microbiome.</a></h1><p>Age-related changes in human gut  composition have been reported, and such changes might be influenced by the intake of nutrients or diets. To investigate the effects of aging on the gut  independent of nutrient effects, we analyzed the gut microbiomes of 126 micro-pigs at a wide range of ages from newborns to 10 years old. The micro-pigs were reared in a constantly controlled environment. The diversity of the gut microbiome was found to continuously change with age. We also found associations between age and specific members and functions of the gut microbiome. Consistent with previous studies on the human gut microbiome, beneficial microbes including probiotic bacteria and short-chain fatty acid-producers decreased in older pigs, whereas Bacteroides increased with age. Based on the correlation network, Bacteroides seemed to have an important role in determining the relative abundances of other beneficial microbes. Our results suggest that maintaining beneficial gut microbes at a specific ratio corresponding to a certain age might contribute to a younger gut microbiome-age. Furthermore, due to similarities with the human system, micro-pigs are a useful animal model to elucidate the links between aging and the microbiome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666028>Diet is not the primary driver of bacterial community structure in the gut of litter-feeding cockroaches.</a></h1><p>Diet is a major determinant of bacterial community structure in termite guts, but evidence of its importance in the closely related cockroaches is conflicting. Here, we investigated the ecological drivers of the bacterial gut  in cockroaches that feed on lignocellulosic leaf litter.The physicochemical conditions determined with microsensors in the guts of Ergaula capucina, Pycnoscelus surinamensis, and Byrsotria rothi were similar to those reported for both wood-feeding and omnivorous cockroaches. All gut compartments were anoxic at the center and showed a slightly acidic to neutral pH and variable but slightly reducing conditions. Hydrogen accumulated only in the crop of B. rothi. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes documented that community structure in individual gut compartments correlated strongly with the respective microenvironmental conditions. A comparison of the hindgut  of cockroaches and termites from different feeding groups revealed that the vast majority of the core taxa in cockroaches with a lignocellulosic diet were present also in omnivorous cockroaches but absent in wood-feeding higher termites.Our results indicate that diet is not the primary driver of bacterial community structure in the gut of wood- and litter-feeding cockroaches. The high similarity to the gut  of omnivorous cockroaches suggests that the dietary components that are actually digested do not differ fundamentally between feeding groups.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680550>Influences of melatonin and endotoxin lipopolysaccharide on goose productive performance and gut .</a></h1><p>1.

Monomeric flavan-3-ols are rapidly absorbed in the small intestine and released in the blood stream as phase II conjugates. Polymeric flavan-3-ols are extensively metabolized by colonic gut  into phenyl-γ-valerolactones and their related phenylvaleric acids. These molecules are the main circulating metabolites in humans after the ingestion of flavan-3-ol rich-products; nevertheless, they have received less attention and their role is not understood yet. Here, we describe the quantification of 8 phenyl-γ-valerolactones and 3 phenylvaleric acids in the urine of 11 subjects on consumption of apples by using UHPLC-ESI-Triple Quad-MS with pure reference compounds. Phenyl-γ-valerolactones, mainly as sulfate and glucuronic acid conjugates, reached maximum excretion between 6 and 12 after apple consumption, with a decline thereafter. Significant differences were detected in the cumulative excretion rates within subjects and in the ratio of dihydroxyphenyl-γ-valerolactone sulfate to glucuronide conjugates.

Here we tested the hypothesis that maternal exercise before and during pregnancy would positively affect glucose homeostasis, pancreatic cell function, and gut  dysbiosis in high-fat diet (HFD) fed dams. Female C57BL/6 mice were fed either a HFD or a low-fat diet (LFD) for 12 weeks. The HFD mice were split into two groups for 4 weeks prior to pregnancy initiation and throughout the pregnancy: sedentary (HFD) or exercised (HFD + Ex). Food intake, body weight, body composition, and glucose and insulin tolerance were measured. At gestation day 19, blood, pancreas, gonadal visceral and subcutaneous fat, plantaris muscle, and cecum were collected for analysis. Both HFD and HFD + Ex mice had impaired glucose clearance compared to LFD mice at 15 days of gestation. No changes were found in pancreatic α- or β-cell health. HFD + Ex mice had significantly reduced visceral fat mass, serum insulin, and leptin levels and increased high-density lipoprotein levels, compared to HFD-fed mice. In contrast to our hypothesis,  diversity and composition were not different among groups. The relative abundance of five bacterial phyla, such as Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Deferribacteres, and Actinobacteria, were not significantly altered with diet or exercise during pregnancy. Our findings suggest that maternal exercise prevents excess visceral fat accumulation, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia associated with a HFD, but not through the alterations of gut  composition or diversity during pregnancy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, we studied the effects of a 6-month calorie restriction (CR), the most powerful intervention extending the lifespan. Our data revealed significant changes of the GM composition during early life development, and we detected differences in the abundance of some bacteria between df/df and N mice, already in early life. Overall, the variability of the  by genotype, time-point and breeding pair showed significant differences. In addition, CR caused significant changes in microbiome according to gastrointestinal (GI) location (distal colon, ileum and cecum), genotype and diet.

Those commensals produce metabolites that have various effects on host biologic functions. Therefore, alterations in the normal composition or diversity of microbiome have been implicated in various diseases, including liver cirrhosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that progression of dysbiosis can be associated with worsening of liver disease. Here, we review the possible roles for gut  in the development, progression and complication of liver disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665283>Deficient Resident Memory T-Cell and Cd8 T-Cell Response to Commensals in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h1><p>Aims: The intestinal  is closely associated with resident memory lymphocytes in mucosal tissue. We sought to understand how acquired cellular and humoral immunity to the  differ in health versus inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Resident memory T-cells (Trm) in colonic biopsies and local antibody responses to intraepithelial microbes were analyzed. Systemic antigen-specific immune T- and B-cell memory to a panel of commensal microbes was assessed.Systemically, healthy blood showed CD4 and occasional CD8 memory T-cell responses to selected intestinal bacteria but few memory B-cell responses. In IBD, CD8 memory T-cell responses decreased although B-cell responses and circulating plasmablasts increased. Possibly secondary to loss of systemic CD8 T-cell responses in IBD, dramatically reduced numbers of mucosal CD8+ Trm and γδ T-cells were observed. IgA responses to intraepithelial bacteria were increased. Colonic Trm expressed CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, characteristic of regulatory T-cells. Cytokines/factors required for Trm differentiation were identified, and in vitro-generated Trm expressed regulatory T-cell function via CD39. Cognate interaction between T-cells and dendritic cells induced T-bet expression in dendritic cells, a key mechanism in regulating cell-mediated mucosal responses.A previously unrecognized imbalance exists between cellular and humoral immunity to the  in IBD, with loss of mucosal T-cell-mediated barrier immunity and uncontrolled antibody responses. Regulatory function of Trm may explain their association with intestinal health. Promoting Trm and their interaction with dendritic cells rather than immunosuppression may reinforce tissue immunity, improve barrier function and prevent B-cell dysfunction in -associated disease and IBD etiology.© European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662077> shapes cutaneous bacterial communities and influences survival of an amphibian host.</a></h1><p>Ongoing investigations into the interactions between microbial communities and their associated hosts are changing how emerging diseases are perceived and ameliorated. Of the numerous host-microbiome-disease systems of study, the emergence of chytridiomycosis (caused by , hereafter ) has been implicated in ongoing declines and extinction events of amphibians worldwide. Interestingly, there has been differential survival among amphibians in resisting  infection and subsequent disease. One factor thought to contribute to this resistance is the host-associated cutaneous .

Rhodnius pallescens is a major vector of Chagas disease in Panama. Understanding the microbial ecology of disease vectors is important in the development of vector management strategies that target vector survival and fitness. In this study we examined the whole-body microbial composition of R. pallescens from three locations in Panama.We collected 89 R. pallescens specimens using Noireau traps in Attalea butyracea palms. We then extracted total DNA from whole-bodies of specimens and amplified bacterial  using 16S rRNA metabarcoding PCR. The 16S libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq and analyzed using QIIME2 software.We found Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes to be the most abundant bacterial phyla across all samples. Geographical location showed the largest difference in microbial composition with northern Veraguas Province having the most diversity and Panama Oeste Province localities being most similar to each other. Wolbachia was detected in high abundance (48-72%) at Panama Oeste area localities with a complete absence of detection in Veraguas Province. No significant differences in microbial composition were detected between triatomine age class, primary blood meal source, or T. cruzi infection status.We found biogeographical regions differ in microbial composition among R. pallescens populations in Panama. While overall the  has bacterial taxa consistent with previous studies in triatomine microbial ecology, locality differences are an important observation for future studies.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is found to be closely involved in the regulation of gut microbial dynamics. However, it is still not clear how AhR signaling shapes the gut . In the present study, adult zebrafish were acutely exposed to an AhR antagonist (CH223191), an AhR agonist (polychlorinated biphenyl 126; PCB126) or their combination for 7 d. Overall intestinal health and gut microbial community were temporally monitored (1 d, 3 d and 7 d) and inter-compared among different groups. The results showed that single exposure to PCB126 significantly disrupted the overall health of intestines (i.e., neural signaling, inflammation, epithelial barrier integrity, oxidative stress). However, CH223191 failed to inhibit but enhanced the physiological toxicities of PCB126, implying the involvement of extra mechanisms rather than AhR in the regulation of intestinal physiological activities. Dysbiosis of gut  was also caused by PCB126 over time as a function of sex. It is intriguing that CH223191 successfully abolished the holistic effects of dioxin on gut , which inferred that growth of gut microbes was directly controlled by AhR activation without the involvement of host feedback modulation. When coming to detailed alterations at certain taxon, both antagonistic and synergistic interactions existed between CH223191 and dioxin, depending on fish sex, exposure duration and bacterial species. Correlation analysis found that gut inflammation was positively associated with pathogenic Legionella bacteria, but was negatively associated with epithelial barrier integrity, suggesting that integral intestinal epithelial barrier can prevent the influx of pathogenic bacteria to induce inflammatory response. Overall, this study has deciphered, for the first time, the direct regulative effects of AhR activity on gut . Future research is warranted to elucidate the specific mechanisms of AhR action on certain bacterial population.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this review, we summarize basic science and clinical research examining the protective properties of milk sphingomyelin (SM) against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. Dietary SM dose-dependently reduces the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, triglycerides, and fatty acids in cell culture and rodent studies. Overall, rodent feeding studies show dietary milk SM, milk polar lipid mixtures, and milk fat globule membrane reduce serum and hepatic lipid concentrations. Furthermore, these hypolipidemic effects are observed in some supplementation studies in humans, although the extent of reductions in serum cholesterol is typically smaller and only one trial was conducted with purified SM. Dietary milk SM has been reported to affect the gut  in rodent studies and its hydrolytic product, sphingosine, displays bactericidal activity in vitro. Milk SM may also improve gut barrier function to prevent the translocation of inflammatory gut bacteria-derived molecules. Current evidence from pre-clinical studies indicates that dietary milk SM has protective properties against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. The hypolipidemic effects of milk SM observed in animal studies have been reported in some human studies, although the magnitude of such effects is typically smaller. More research is warranted to clearly define how dietary milk SM influences lipid metabolism, gut , and inflammation in humans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Now, almost a century later, the adverse consequences of these highly effective drugs have become evident in the form of antibiotic-resistant infections, which are on the rise around the world. The search for solutions to this problem has involved both the introduction of newer types of antibiotics and, increasingly, the development of alternative strategies to prevent infections due to multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this article, we review the pathophysiological connection between the use of antibiotics and the occurrence of such infections. We also discuss some alternative strategies that are currently under development.This review is based on pertinent articles that appeared from January 2000 to April 2019 and were retrieved by a selective search in the PubMed database employing the search term "( OR microbiome) AND infection." Further suggestions by our author team regarding relevant literature were considered as well.The spectrum of preventive strategies encompasses measures for the protection of the intestinal  (antimicrobial stewardship, neutralization of antibiotic residues in the bowel, use of phages and species-specific antibiotics) as well as measures for its reconstitution (prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal  transfer).In view of the major problem that multidrug-resistant bacteria pose for the world's population and the resources now being spent on the search for a solution, derived both from public funding and from the pharmaceutical industry, we hope to see new, clinically useful approaches being developed and implemented in the near future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678358>Site Specific Microbiome of Leishmania Parasite and its Cross-talk with Immune Milieu.</a></h1><p> consists of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms found in all multicellular organisms.

Here, we examine the airway  during the first three months of life by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in the population-based Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC) cohort consisting of 700 children monitored for the development of asthma since birth. Microbial diversity and the relative abundances of Veillonella and Prevotella in the airways at age one month are associated with asthma by age 6 years, both individually and with additional taxa in a multivariable model. Higher relative abundance of these bacteria is furthermore associated with an airway immune profile dominated by reduced TNF-α and IL-1β and increased CCL2 and CCL17, which itself is an independent predictor for asthma. These findings suggest a mechanism of -immune interactions in early infancy that predisposes to childhood asthma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663195>Natural compulsive-like behaviour in the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii) is associated with altered gut  composition.</a></h1><p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric illness that significantly impacts affected patients, and available treatments yield suboptimal therapeutic response. Recently, the role of the gut-brain axis (GBA) in psychiatric illness has emerged as a potential target for therapeutic exploration. However, studies concerning the role of the GBA in OCD are limited. To investigate whether a naturally occurring obsessive-compulsive-like phenotype in a rodent model, i.e. large nest-building in deer mice, is associated with perturbations in the gut microbiome, we investigated and characterized the gut  in specific pathogen free bred and housed large (LNB) and normal (NNB) nest building deer mice of both sexes (n = 11 per group, including 3 males and 8 females). Following baseline characterisation of nest building behaviour, a single faecal sample was collected from each animal and the gut  analysed. Our results reveal the overall microbial composition of LNB animals to be distinctly different compared to controls (PERMANOVA p < 0.05). While no genera were found to be significantly differentially abundant after correcting for multiple comparisons, the normal phenotype showed a higher loading of Prevotella and Anaeroplasma, while the OC-phenotype demonstrated a higher loading of Desulfovermiculus, Aestuariispira, Peptococcus and Holdemanella (cut-off threshold for loading at 0.2 in either the first or second component of the PCA). These findings not only provide proof-of-concept for continued investigation of the GBA in OCD, but also highlight a potential underlying etiological association between alterations in the gut  and the natural development of obsessive-compulsive-like behaviours.© 2019 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659235>Should we evaluate intestinal  of pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation?</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661027>Influence of pig gut  on Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae susceptibility.</a></h1><p>This study investigated the influence of gut microbiome composition in modulating susceptibility to Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae in pigs. Thirty-two conventional M. hyopneumoniae free piglets were randomly selected from six different litters at 3 weeks of age and were experimentally inoculated with M. hyopneumoniae at 8 weeks of age. Lung lesion scores (LS) were recorded 4 weeks post-inoculation (12 weeks of age) from piglet lungs at necropsy. Fecal bacterial community composition of piglets at 3, 8 and 12 weeks of age were targeted by amplifying the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The LS ranged from 0.3 to 43% with an evident clustering of the scores observed in piglets within litters. There were significant differences in species richness and alpha diversity in fecal microbiomes among piglets within litters at different time points (p < 0.05). The dissimilarity matrices indicated that at 3 weeks of age, the fecal  of piglets was more dissimilar compared to those from 8 to 12 weeks of age. Specific groups of bacteria in the gut that might predict the decreased severity of M. hyopneumoniae associated lesions were identified. The microbial shift at 3 weeks of age was observed to be driven by the increase in abundance of the indicator family, Ruminococcaceae in piglets with low LS (p < 0.05). The taxa, Ruminococcus_2 having the highest richness scores, correlated significantly between litters showing stronger associations with the lowest LS (r = -0.49, p = 0.005).

The goal of this study was to use the Gallus gallus (broiler chicken) intra-amniotic administration of physiologically relevant concentrations of TiO, SiO, and ZnO to better understand the effects of NP exposure on gut health and function. Immediately after hatch, blood, cecum, and small intestine were collected for assessment of iron (Fe)-metabolism, zinc (Zn)-metabolism, brush border membrane (BBM) functional, and pro-inflammatory related proteins gene expression; blood Fe and Zn levels; cecum weight; and the relative abundance of intestinal microflora. NP type, dose, and the presence or absence of minerals was shown to result in altered mineral transporter, BBM functional, and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Metal oxide NP also altered the abundance of intestinal bacterial populations.

IGFs take part in the embryonal development and postnatal growth, in interaction with the growth hormone (GH). The physiological effects of IGF1 are promotion of tissue growth and development, stimulation of cell proliferation, effects on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anabolic, anti-oxidant, neuro- and hepatoprotective properties. Our knowledge about the GH/IGF axis is diverse, partly contradictory, their research is continued intensively nowadays. We considered it worthwhile to review and interpret this information. Study on GH/IGF medical reports, with particular reference to the less known metabolic control. 75% of the growth factors are produced in the liver by GH and insulin stimulation; their effects are expressed on specific receptors, and modified by specific binding proteins. IGF1 directly increases the muscle mass, bone density, and the structure of the bones. Intestinal  induces secretion of IGF1, which promotes the development and remodeling of the bones. Short-chain fatty acids, produced in microbial fermented fibers, induce secretion of IGF1, suggesting that microbial activity also affects bone health  IGF1. IGF1 also has a direct and indirect glucose-lowering effect, enhances free fatty acid oxidation in the muscle, reducing the flow of free fatty acid into the liver, improving insulin signaling, resulting in the reduction of hepatic glucose output, and improves insulin sensitivity. IGF1 directly influences the expression of circadian BMAL1 in hypothalamic cells: this refers to the newly recognized 'zeitgeber' role of IGF1. The bioactivity of insulin-like peptides in the brain is characterized by neuronal survival, excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, maintenance of normal free fatty acid levels, improvement of cognitive function, protection against cell damage, neurogenesis and angiogenesis. The effects of IGF2 are less outlined, however, it has a relevant role in the development of the fetus, and acts protectively on the brain. Lack or over-expression of IGF1 can be detected or may causally associated in many pathological conditions. According to these collected data, insulin sensitivity may be improved by different pathways. The role of IGFs in these processes should be a task of future research.

Despite its lifesaving potential, immune-mediated allo-reactivity inherent to the allogeneic transplantation can be observed within up to 50% of all allo-HCT patients regularly resulting in the manifestation of acute and/or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Mechanistically, especially donor T cells are assumed to chiefly drive inflammation that can occur in virtually all organs, with the skin, liver, and gut representing as the most frequently affected anatomic sites.

This study aimed to investigate whether the cattle breed affects specific ruminal taxonomic microbial groups and functions associated with feed conversion ratio (FCR), using two genetically related Angus breeds as a model. Total RNA was extracted from 24 rumen content samples collected from purebred Black and Red Angus bulls fed the same forage diet and then subjected to metatranscriptomic analysis. Multivariate discriminant analysis (sparse partial least square discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA)) and analysis of composition of microbiomes were conducted to identify microbial signatures characterizing Black and Red Angus cattle. Our analyses revealed relationships among bacterial signatures, host breeds and FCR. Although Black and Red Angus are genetically similar, sPLS-DA detected 25 bacterial species and 10 functions that differentiated the rumen microbial signatures between those two breeds. In Black Angus, we identified bacterial taxa Chitinophaga pinensis, Clostridium stercorarium and microbial functions with large and small subunits ribosomal proteins L16 and S7 exhibiting a higher abundance in the rumen microbiome. In Red Angus, nonetheless, we identified the poorly characterized bacterial taxon Oscillibacter valericigenes with a higher abundance and pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism. Analysis of composition of microbiomes revealed that C. pinensis and C. stercorarium exhibited a higher abundance in Black Angus compared to Red Angus associated with FCR, suggesting that these bacterial species may play a key role in the feed conversion efficiency of forage-fed bulls.

As a result of weaning, two major changes - normally occurring in vivo - were detected in the system: firstly, Firmicutes diminished when Bacteroidetes increased particularly in the proximal colon; secondly, Bacteroides decreased and Prevotella increased (mean value for four runs). In terms of metabolite production, while a ratio acetate: propionate: butyrate of 60:26:14 was obtained in post-weaned colon, the expected inversion of the ratio propionate: butyrate in the post-weaned ileum was unfortunately not observed. To conclude, the so-called baby-SPIME model meets expectations regarding the resident  of the proximal colon bioreactor and the metabolites produced thereof. In terms of the evolution of major groups of bacteria, the in vitro weaning process appeared to be successful. However, higher concentration of butyric acid would have been expected in ileum part of newly weaned piglets, as observed in vivo. The  in the ileum bioreactor seemed in fact to act like a pre-colon. This suggests that microbial profile in ileum bioreactor had to be improved.Copyright © 2019.

Cells of strain KGMB03357 are Gram-stain-positive, non-motile, non-spore-forming, and observed as straight or curved rods. The isolate grew at 10-45°C (optimum temperature of 40°C) and a pH range of 5.1-10.5 (optimum pH of 6.8). Analysis of phylogenetic trees based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain KGMB03357 forms a lineage within the genus Anaerotignum, and is most closely related to Anaerotignum lactatifermentans G17 (= KCTC 15066, 96.1%), Anaerotignum propionicum DSM 1682T (= KCTC 5582, 94.9%), Anaerotignum neopropionicum DSM 03847 (= KCTC 15564T, 94.9%), and Anaerotignum aminivorans SH021 (= KCTC 15705T, 94.8%). The ANI values between strain KGMB 03357T and members of the genus Anaerotignum were 73.3-71.0%, which are below the ANI criterion for interspecies identity. The DNA G + C content based on the whole-genome sequence is 47.3 mol%. The major cellular fatty acids of strain KGMB03357 are C, C, C cis 9, and anteiso-C. Strain KGMB03357T contains meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic amino acid in the cell wall peptidoglycan. Based on the phenotypic, phylogenetic, and genomic properties, strain KGMB 03357 represents a novel species of the genus Anaerotignum, for which the name Anaerotignum faecicola sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KGMB03357 (= KCTC 15736T = DSM 107953).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677875>Does soil CuO nanoparticles pollution alter the gut  and resistome of Enchytraeus crypticus?</a></h1><p>Growing evidence suggests that metallic oxide nanoparticles can pose a severe risk to the health of invertebrates. Previous attention has been mostly paid to the effects of metallic oxide nanoparticles on the survival, growth and physiology of animals. In comparison, the effects on gut  and incidence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soil fauna remain poorly understood. We conducted a microcosm study to explore the responses of the non-target soil invertebrate Enchytraeus crypticus gut  and resistomes to copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) and copper nitrate by using bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons sequencing and high throughput quantitative PCR. The results showed that exposure to Cu resulted in higher bioaccumulation (P < 0.05) and lower body weight and reproduction (P < 0.05) of Enchytraeus crypticus than exposure to CuO NPs. Nevertheless, exposure to CuO NPs for 21 days markedly increased the alpha-diversity of the gut  of Enchytraeus crypticus (P < 0.05) and shifted the gut microbial communities, with a significant decline in the relative abundance of the phylum Planctomycetes (from 37.26% to 19.80%, P < 0.05) and a significant elevation in the relative abundance of the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Acidobacteria (P < 0.05). The number of detected ARGs in the Enchytraeus crypticus gut significantly decreased from 45 in the Control treatment to 16 in the Cu(NO) treatment and 20 in the CuO NPs treatment. The abundance of ARGs in the Enchytraeus crypticus gut were also significantly decreased to 38.48% when exposure to Cu(NO) and 44.90% when exposure to CuO NPs (P < 0.05) compared with the controls.

The causative organism, Paenibacillus larvae, attacks honey bee brood and renders entire hives dysfunctional during active disease states, but more commonly resides in hives asymptomatically as inactive spores that elude even vigilant beekeepers. The mechanism of this pathogenic transition is not fully understood, and no cure exists for AFB. Here, we evaluated how hive supplementation with probiotic lactobacilli (delivered through a nutrient patty; BioPatty) affected colony resistance towards a naturally occurring AFB outbreak. Results demonstrated a significantly lower pathogen load and proteolytic activity of honey bee larvae from BioPatty-treated hives. Interestingly, a distinctive shift in the  composition of adult nurse bees occurred irrespective of treatment group during the monitoring period, but only vehicle-supplemented nurse bees exhibited higher P. larvae loads. In vitro experiments utilizing laboratory-reared honey bee larvae showed Lactobacillus plantarum Lp39, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1, and Lactobacillus kunkeei BR-1 (contained in the BioPatty) could reduce pathogen load, upregulate expression of key immune genes, and improve survival during P. larvae infection. These findings suggest the usage of a lactobacilli-containing hive supplement, which is practical and affordable for beekeepers, may be effective for reducing enzootic pathogen-related hive losses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654910>The mycobiota: fungi take their place between plants and bacteria.</a></h1><p>Eukaryotes host numerous intracellular and associated microbes in their .

Some fungal species are commensal organisms that are part of the normal human , and, as such, do not pose a threat to the immune system. However, when the natural balance of this association is disturbed or the host's immune system is compromised, these fungal pathogens overtake the organism, and cause IFI. To understand the invasiveness of these pathogens and to address the growing problem of IFI, it is essential to identify the cellular processes of the invading organism and their virulence. In this review, we will discuss the prevalence and current options available to treat IFI, including recent reports of drug resistance. Nevertheless, the main focus of this review is to describe the glycobiology of human fungal pathogens and how various components of the fungal cell wall, particularly cell wall polysaccharides and glycoconjugates, are involved in fungal pathogenicity, their biosynthesis and how they can be potentially exploited to develop novel antifungal treatment options. We will specifically describe the nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) that are important in fungal survival and suggest that the inhibition of fungal NSTs may potentially be useful to prevent the establishment of fungal infections.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669313>Does the gut  contribute to the oligodendrocyte progenitor niche?</a></h1><p>The past decade has seen a growing number of studies on the relationship between the gut  and the brain. This mini-review will focus on the unexpected findings linking the microbiome to myelination. We first address the temporal correlation between the acquisition of a gut  in the developing organism and developmental myelination. We then review the factors impacting the composition of the child's gut , ranging from maternal stress to modality of delivery and from breastfeeding and diet composition to antibiotic treatment early in life. We discuss the topic of gut-brain communication with an emphasis on myelination, and propose the concept that gut microbes produce metabolites which may constitute a "metabolic" niche. Distinct bacterial communities may create very different "niches", some permissive and others inhibitory for myelin generation or maintenance. We speculate that this concept of "gut dysbiosis" may also in part explain the reduced myelin content detected in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. We conclude by envisioning intervention with probiotics and prebiotics to favor the formation of a microbial metabolic "niche" favoring myelin production to promote brain health.Copyright © 2019.

Some reports infer that CG is mainly associated with dental infection but no firm or reliable microbiological evidence has been provided for a causative organism. This study aimed to evaluate whether microorganisms contribute to the etiology of CG in order to inform appropriate treatment op tions in clinic.Unstimulated saliva was collected from 15 CG patients who were diagnosed clinically and pathologically and 15 healthy controls (HC). DNA was extracted from the precipitate of the centrifuged saliva for 16s rRNA high-throughput sequencing using the Miseq PE300 platform. The distribution of the microbiome between the two groups was compared.CG patients had a greater microbial flora that was more diverse than the HC. Prevotella, Alloprevotella, Porphyromonas, Actinomyces, Rothia, Fusobacterium, Haemophilus, and Aggregatibacter had a significantly higher abundance in CG patients. In contrast, Streptococcus and Campylobacter were the most abundant genera in HC with a mean relative abundance of 63% and 2%, respectively. The microbiological network indicated that most of the bacteria that were enriched at greater levels in CG patients were likely to be Prevotella, Actinomyces, and Rothia. These have been shown to co-exist with other bacteria.The composition and structure of bacterial communities in CG patients were different from HC. Most of the genera observed in CG patients were associated with periodontitis and pulp infection. These findings might be helpful in understanding the etiology of CG.

The present study aims to assess the impact of a high fat diet on tuberculosis progression and  composition in an experimental animal model using a C3HeB/FeJ mouse strain submitted to single or multiple consecutive aerosol infections. These models allowed us to study the protection induced by Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination as well as by the natural immunity induced by chemotherapy after a low dose  infection. Our results show that a high fat diet is able to trigger a pro-inflammatory response, which results in a faster progression toward active tuberculosis and an impaired protective effect of BCG vaccination, which is not the case for natural immunity. This may be related to dysbiosis and a reduction in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the gut  caused by a decrease in the abundance of the Porphyromonadaceae family and, in particular, the  genus. It should also be noted that a high fat diet is also related to an increase in the genera , and , which have previously been related to dysbiotic processes.

According to Dickson's conceptual model, the lung  (LMt) is a dynamic ecosystem, whose composition, in healthy lungs, is likely to reflect microbial migration, reproduction, and elimination. However, which microbial genera constitutes a "healthy microbiome" per se remains hotly debated. It is now widely accepted that a bi-directional gut-lung axis connects the intestinal with the pulmonary  and that the diet could have a role in modulating both microbiotas as in health as in pathological status. The LMt is altered in numerous respiratory disorders such as obstructive airway diseases, interstitial lung diseases, infections, and lung cancer. Some authors hypothesize that the use of specific bacterial strains, termed "probiotics," with positive effects on the host immunity and/or against pathogens, could have beneficial effects in the treatment of intestinal disorders and pulmonary diseases. In this manuscript, we have reviewed the literature available on the LMt to delineate and discuss the potential relationship between composition alterations of LMt and lung diseases.

Trophic interactions may be altered through climate-dependent changes in either predator food preferences or prey communities. Yet, climate change impacts on predator diet remain surprisingly poorly understood. We experimentally studied the consequences of 2°C warmer climatic conditions on the trophic niche of a generalist lizard predator. We used a system of semi-natural mesocosms housing a variety of invertebrate species and in which climatic conditions were manipulated. Lizards in warmer climatic conditions ate at a greater predatory to phytophagous invertebrate ratio and had smaller individual dietary breadths. These shifts mainly arose from direct impacts of climate on lizard diets rather than from changes in prey communities. Dietary changes were associated with negative changes in fitness-related traits (body condition, gut ) and survival. We demonstrate that climate change alters trophic interactions through top-predator dietary shifts, which might disrupt eco-evolutionary dynamics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678829>Drugging the gut : toward rational modulation of bacterial composition in the gut.</a></h1><p>The human gastrointestinal tract hosts almost a trillion microorganisms, organized in a complex community known as the gut , an integral part of human physiology and metabolism.

Previously, it was thought that C. difficile was primarily a hospital-acquired infection, however, with the emergence of community-associated cases, and whole-genome sequencing suggesting the majority of the hospital C. difficile infection (CDI) cases are genetically distinct from one another, there is compelling evidence that sources/reservoirs of C. difficile outside hospitals play a significant role in the transmission of CDI.To review the 'One Health' aspects of CDI, focusing on how community sources/reservoirs might be acting as a conduit in the transfer of C. difficile between animals and humans.

The source of colonization is most probably community reservoirs, such as foods and the environment, where toxigenic C. difficile strains have frequently been isolated. With high-resolution genomic sequencing, the transmission of C. difficile between animals and humans is likely despite a clear epidemiological link often being absent. The ways in which C. difficile from animals and humans can disseminate through foods and the environment are discussed; and an interconnected transmission pathway for C. difficile involving food animals, humans and the environment is presented.C. difficile is a well-established pathogen of both humans and animals that contaminates foods and the environment.

About half of patients with IBD develop rheumatic ailments and microscopic intestinal inflammation is present in up to half of CRD patients. IBD and CRD patients also share a common therapeutic armamentarium. Disequilibrium in the complex realm of microbes (known as dysbiosis) that closely interact with the gut mucosal immune system has been associated with both IBD and CRD (spondyloarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis). Whether dysbiosis represents an epiphenomenon or a prodromal feature remains to be determined.In an attempt to further investigate whether specific gut dysbiosis may be the missing link between IBD and CRD in patients developing both diseases, we performed here a systematic literature review focusing on studies looking at bacterial  in CRD and/or IBD patients.We included 80 studies, with a total of 3799 IBD patients without arthritis, 1084 CRD patients without IBD, 132 IBD patients with arthropathy manifestations and 12 spondyloarthritis patients with IBD history. Overall, this systematic review indicates that an increase in s,  and  genera, as well as a decrease in  genera and species belonging to Verrucomicrobia and Fusobacteria phyla are common features in IBD and CRD patients, whereas dozens of bacterial species are specific features of CRD and IBD.Further work is needed to understand the functions of bacteria and of their metabolites but also to characterize fungi and viruses that are commonly found in these patients.© Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677064>Hippocampus-specific regulation of long non-coding RNA and mRNA expression in germ-free mice.</a></h1><p>Gut  can affect multiple brain functions and cause behavioral alterations through the -gut-brain axis. In our previous study, we found that the absence of gut  can influence the expression of microRNAs and mRNAs in the hippocampal region of the germ-free (GF) mice. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly being recognized as an important functional transcriptional regulator in the brain. In the present study, we aim to identify possible biological pathways and functional networks for lncRNA-associated transcript of the gut  in relation to the brain function. The profiles of lncRNA and mRNA from specific pathogen-free (SPF), colonized GF (CGF), and GF mice were generated using the Agilent Mouse LncRNA Array v2.0. Differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified, and lncRNA target genes were also predicted. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was performed to analyze related signaling pathways and biological functions associated with these dysregulated mRNAs and target genes. Validation with quantitative real-time PCR was performed on several key genes. Compared with SPF mice a total of 2230 DE lncRNAs were found in GF mice. Among these, 1355 were upregulated and 875 were downregulated. After comparing the target genes of DE lncRNAs with mRNA datasets, 669 overlapping genes were identified. IPA core analyses revealed that most of these genes were highly associated with cardiac hypertrophy, nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFAT) gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), calcium, and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling pathways. Additionally, mRNA expression levels of APP, CASP9, IGFBP2, PTGDS, and TGFBR2 genes that are involved in central nervous system functions were significantly changed in the GF mouse hippocampus.

Besides that, our data revealed that L-Arabinose modulated gut  disturbed by DSS treatment. Additionally, by antibiotic treatment, the perturbed gut  was responsible for the suppressive effects of L-Arabinose on DSS-induced colitis. Lastly, Caco-2 cells was used to confirm the protective effects of L-Arabinose. As expected, the expression levels of pro-inflammatory proteins in Caco-2 cells treated with L-Arabinose in absence or presence of TNFα.

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) enables the identification of  specific to the lower lung but commonly has low bacterial density, increasing the risk of false-positive signal from contaminating DNA. The objectives of this study were to investigate the extent of contamination across a range of sample densities representative of BALF and identify features of contaminants that facilitate their removal from sequence data and aid in the interpretation of BALF sample 16S sequencing data.Using three mock communities across a range of densities ranging from 8E+ 02 to 8E+ 09 16S copies/ml, we assessed taxonomic accuracy and precision by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the proportion of reads arising from contaminants. Sequencing accuracy, precision, and the relative abundance of mock community members decreased with sample input density, with a significant drop-off below 8E+ 05 16S copies/ml. Contaminant OTUs were commonly inversely correlated with sample input density or not reproduced between technical replicates. Removal of taxa with these features or physical concentration of samples prior to sequencing improved both sequencing accuracy and precision for samples between 8E+ 04 and 8E+ 06 16S copies/ml. For the lowest densities, below 8E+ 03 16S copies/ml BALF, accuracy and precision could not be significantly improved using these approaches. Using clinical BALF samples across a large density range, we observed that OTUs with features of contaminants identified in mock communities were also evident in low-density BALF samples.Relative abundance data and community composition generated by 16S sequencing of BALF samples across the range of density commonly observed in this sample type should be interpreted in the context of input sample density and may be improved by simple pre- and post-sequencing steps for densities above 8E+ 04 16S copies/ml.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680997>Simulated Weightlessness Perturbs the Intestinal Metabolomic Profile of Rats.</a></h1><p>Recently, disorders of intestinal homeostasis in the space environment have been extensively demonstrated. Accumulating evidence have suggested microgravity and simulated weightlessness could induce dysbiosis of intestinal , which may contribute to the bowel symptoms during spaceflight. However, the specific responses of intestinal metabolome under simulated weightlessness and its relationship with the intestinal microbiome and immune characteristics remain largely unknown. In the current study, 20 adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into the control group and the simulated weightlessness group using a hindlimb unloading model. The metabolomic profiling of cecal contents from eight rats of each group was investigated by gas chromatography-time of flight/mass spectrometry. The significantly different metabolites, biomarkers, and related pathways were identified. Multivariate analysis, such as principal component analysis and orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis, demonstrated an obvious separation between the control group and the simulated weightlessness group. Significantly different metabolites, such as xylose, sinapinic acid, indolelactate, and digalacturonic acid, were identified, which participate in mainly pyrimidine metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and valine, leucine and isoleucine metabolism. Cytidine-5'-monophosphate, 4-hydroxypyridine, and phloretic acid were determined as pivotal biomarkers under simulated weightlessness. Moreover, the significantly different metabolites were remarkably correlated with dysbiosis of the intestinal  and disturbance of immunological characteristics induced by simulated weightlessness. These metabolic features provide crucial candidates for therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders under weightlessness.Copyright © 2019 Jin, Wang, Zhang, Zhou and Zhao.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679249>The Critical Role of the Antimicrobial Peptide LL-37/ CRAMP in Protection of Colon  Balance, Mucosal Homeostasis, Anti-Inflammatory Responses, and Resistance to Carcinogenesis.</a></h1><p>Mouse cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) and its homologue human cathelicidin (LL-37) play active roles in innate immune responses, angiogenesis, and wound healing.

However, its importance on the periphery is still not fully elucidated. KYNA is produced endogenously in various types of peripheral cells, tissues and by gastrointestinal . Furthermore, it was found in several products of daily human diet and its absorption in the digestive tract was evidenced. More recent studies were focused on the potential role of KYNA in carcinogenesis and cancer therapy; however, the results were ambiguous and the biological activity of KYNA in these processes has not been unequivocally established. This review aims to summarize the current views on the relationship between KYNA and cancer. The differences in KYNA concentration between physiological conditions and cancer, as well as KYNA production by both normal and cancer cells, will be discussed. The review also describes the effect of KYNA on cancer cell proliferation and the known potential molecular mechanisms of this activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678397>The gut  and diabetic cardiomyopathy in humans.</a></h1><p>Type 2 diabetes (DT2) increases the risk of cardiovascular events and cardiac insufficiency. This insufficiency is mostly post-ischaemic in nature, but other aetiologies are possible in this high-risk population. In patients with DT2, diabetic cardiomyopathy is a recognized cause of cardiac insufficiency secondary to chronic hyperglycaemia and myocardial lipotoxicity, which promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (and, frequently, apoptosis of these cells), interstitial fibrosis and a decrease in myocardial contractile performance. Several studies have shown that diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with modifications to the intestinal , and changes in the synthesis of bacterial metabolites and their diffusion into the host, some of which appear to have direct deleterious effects on cardiac contractility. These findings open up new perspectives for pathophysiological studies by establishing the presence of a '-myocardium' axis and raising the possibility of innovative new treatments. Correction of intestinal dysbiosis in patients with cardiac insufficiency could, therefore, constitute an innovative therapeutic approach to cases of this disease with a poor prognosis.Copyright © 2019.

The  also interacts with and metabolizes compounds produced by the host, such as primary bile acids. Lactate and bile acids (BA) are of particular interest in gastrointestinal diseases because they have been associated with metabolic acidosis and bile acid diarrhea, respectively. The objectives of this study were to validate an enzymatic assay to quantify D-, L-, and total lactate in canine feces, and to characterize fecal lactate and BA concentrations as well as bacterial abundances in healthy dogs and dogs with gastrointestinal diseases. Fecal samples were collected from 34 healthy dogs, 15 dogs with chronic enteropathy (CE), and 36 dogs with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). Lactate was quantified with an enzymatic assay, BA with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and 11 bacterial groups with qPCR. A fecal lactate reference interval was established from 34 healthy dogs and was 0.7-1.4 mM, 0.3-6.0 mM, and 1.0-7.0 mM for D-, L-, and total lactate, respectively. The assay to measure D-, L-, and total lactate in canine fecal samples was linear, accurate, precise, and reproducible. Significant increases in fecal lactate and decreases in secondary BA concentrations were observed in dogs with CE and dogs with EPI. Dogs with EPI had an increased abundance of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium; a decreased abundance of Fusobacterium and Clostridium hiranonis; and a higher Dysbiosis Index when compared to healthy dogs. Further studies are necessary to determine the clinical utility of lactate and BA quantification in canine feces. These metabolites suggest functional alterations of intestinal dysbiosis and may become promising targets for further elucidating the role of the  in health and disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681281>Uterine Immunity and : A Shifting Paradigm.</a></h1><p>The female reproductive tract harbors distinct microbial communities, as in the vagina, cervical canal, uterus, and fallopian tubes. The nature of the vaginal  is well-known; in contrast, the upper reproductive tract remains largely unexplored. Alteration in the uterine , which is dependent on the nutrients and hormones available to the uterus, is likely to play an important role in uterine-related diseases such as hysteromyoma, adenomyosis, and endometriosis. Uterine mucosa is an important tissue barrier whose main function is to offer protection against pathogens and other toxic factors, while maintaining a symbiotic relationship with commensal microbes. These characteristics are shared by all the mucosal tissues; however, the uterine mucosa is unique since it changes cyclically during the menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy. The immune system, besides its role in the defense process, plays crucial roles in reproduction as it ensures local immune tolerance to fetal/paternal antigens, trophoblast invasion, and vascular remodeling. The human endometrium contains a conspicuous number of immune cells, mainly Natural Killers (NK) cells, which are phenotypically distinct from peripheral cytotoxic NK, cells and macrophages. The endometrium also contains few lymphoid aggregates comprising B cell and CD8 T cells. The number and the phenotype of these cells change during the menstrual cycle. It has become evident in recent years that the immune cell phenotype and function can be influenced by . Immune cells can sense the presence of microbes through their pattern recognition receptors, setting up host-microbe interaction. The  exerts an appropriately controlled defense mechanism by competing for nutrients and mucosal space with pathogens. It has recently been considered that uterus is a non-sterile compartment since it seems to possess its own . There has been an increasing interest in characterizing the nature of microbial colonization within the uterus and its apparent impact on fertility and pregnancy. This review will examine the potential relationship between the uterine  and the immune cells present in the local environment.Copyright © 2019 Agostinis, Mangogna, Bossi, Ricci, Kishore and Bulla.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672735>Whole-Genome Sequences of Five Strains of Kocuria rosea, NCTC2676, NCTC7514, NCTC7512, NCTC7528, and NCTC7511.</a></h1><p> is a Gram-positive coccus found in the environment and within normal human skin , and more recently, it has been potentially implicated as an opportunistic pathogen.

TRALI is one of the leading causes of transfusion-related fatalities and specific therapies are unavailable. Neutrophils are recognized as the major pathogenic cells, whereas T regulatory cells and dendritic cells appear to be important for protection against TRALI. The pathogenesis, however, is complex and incompletely understood. It is frequently postulated that the complement system plays an important role in the TRALI pathogenesis. In this article, we assess the evidence regarding the involvement of complement in TRALI from both human and animal studies. We hypothesize about the potential connection between the complement system and neutrophils in TRALI. Additionally, we draw parallels between TRALI and other acute pulmonary disorders of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome regarding the involvement of complement. We conclude that, even though a role for complement in the TRALI pathogenesis seems plausible, studies investigating the role of complement in TRALI are remarkably limited in number and also present conflicting findings. Different types of TRALI animal models, diverse experimental conditions, and the composition of the gastrointestinal  may perhaps all be factors which contribute to these discrepancies. More systematic studies are warranted to shed light on the contribution of the complement cascade in TRALI. The underlying clinical condition of the patient, which influences the susceptibility to TRALI, as well as the transfusion factor (antibody-mediated vs non-antibody-mediated), will be important to take into consideration when researching the contribution of complement. This should significantly increase our understanding of the role of complement in TRALI and may potentially result in promising new treatment strategies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To investigate the prebiotic effect of patchouli essential oil (PEO) and its derived compounds through the modulation of gut  (GM). C57BL/6J mice were treated with the PEO and three active components of PEO,  patchouli alcohol (PA), pogostone (PO) and β-patchoulene (β-PAE) for 15 consecutive days. Fecal samples and mucosa were collected for GM biomarkers studies. PEO, PA, PO, and β-PAE improve the gut epithelial barrier by altering the status of E-cadherin vs. N-cadherin expressions, and increasing the mucosal p-lysozyme and Muc 2. Moreover, the treatments also facilitate the polarization of M1 to M2 macrophage phenotypes, meanwhile, suppress the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Fecal microbial DNAs were analyzed and evaluated for GM composition by ERIC-PCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The GM diversity was increased with the treated groups compared to the control. Further analysis showed that some known short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, , , , , and  were significantly enriched in the treated groups. In addition, the key SCFAs receptors, GPR 41, 43 and 109a, were significantly stimulated in the gut epithelial layer of the treated mice. By contract, the relative abundance of pathogens  spp., , and  spp. were distinctly reduced by the treatments with PEO and β-PAE. Our findings provide insightful information that the /host dynamic interaction may play a key role for the pharmacological activities of PEO, PA, PO, and β-PAE.Copyright © 2019 Leong, Huang, Khan, Xia, Li, Liu, Li, Han, Su and Hsiao.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662903>Are Nonnutritive Sweeteners Obesogenic?

The study explored changes in the faecal  and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) associated with the diet (including nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs)) and evaluated metabolic consequences in subjects with morbid obesity. The diet was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire. One unit of NNSs was 100 mL beverage with NNSs or 2 tablets/teaspoons of NNSs. The faecal  was assessed with GA-map® dysbiosis test and SCFA with gas chromatography and flame ionisation detection. Fourteen men and 75 women with a mean age of 44.6 (SD 8.7) years, BMI 41.8 (SD 3.6) kg/m, and intake of NNSs 7.5 units/day (SD 3.2; range 0-43) were included. Faecal butyric acid was positively and negatively associated with the intake of starch (partial correlation = 0.264; =0.015) and NNSs (partial correlation = -0.274; =0.011), respectively. NNSs were associated with changes in four out of 39 bacterial groups. Butyric acid has antiobesogenic effects, reduces insulin resistance, and improves dyslipidaemia. Since the weight-reducing effect of NNSs on obese adults trying to lose weight is dubious, it seems imprudent to use NNSs that might counteract the favourable effects of butyric acid.Copyright © 2019 Per G.

Gut  play pivotal roles in mediating psychological behaviors by regulating gut barrier integrity and systemic inflammatory responses. Here, we found that oral sesamin administration (50 mg/kg·bodyweight/day) significantly attenuated depressive, aversive, repetitive, and anxiety-like behaviors in a long-term multiple nonsocial stress-treated mice model. Sesamin inhibited stress-induced gut barrier integrity damage, reduced circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, and suppressed neuroinflammatory responses. Moreover, sesamin treatment also restructured the gut microbiome by enhancing the relative abundances of Bacteroidales and S24-7. The correlation analysis indicated that the  composition changes were strongly correlated with behavioral disorders, serotonin, norepinephrine, and LPS levels. In conclusion, sesamin has preventive effects on stress-induced behavioral and psychological disorders, which might be highly related to the reshaped  composition.

The HAP strain isolated from roach intestine was Enterococcus faecium strain CGMCC1.2136. The experiment was a simple completely randomized design and lasted for eight weeks. Two hundred and seventy fish with an average weight of 12 g randomly distributed into nine tanks. The trial consisted of three treatments with three respective replications. During the experimental period, fish received basal diet without any bacterial supplementation (as the control group), basal diet enriched with 10 CFU g HAP or 10 CFU g CP. At the end of the experiment, serum immune parameters of those fish fed HAP including alkaline phosphatase activity, total protein content, total immunoglobulin level, lysozyme activity and complement activity (ACH50) were significantly higher that other experimental groups (P < 0.05). Similarly, dietary supplementation of HAP resulted in better mucosal immune parameters in comparison to control group and commercial probiotic administration (P < 0.05). Intestinal heterotrophic bacteria and autochthonous LAB counts of those fish fed HAP were significantly higher than other experimental groups at the end of the experiment as well as 15 days seizing probiotic administrations (P < 0.05). Fish fed with HAP containing diet presented significantly higher amylase, lipase and protease activity in comparison to the CP fed fish and the control group (P < 0.05). Growth indices of those fish fed HAP were significantly higher than other treatments (P < 0.05). The highest carcass protein and ash content along with the lowest body moisture content belonged to those fish received HAP (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the use host-HAP resulted in better immune competence and growth performance and it seems aquaculture sector should probably focus on the development of probiotics isolated from the cultured species instead of using terrestrial probiotics with greatly different requirements and environmental conditions.Copyright © 2019.

Most members of the root microbiome possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens [2]. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host immunity and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root , including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [5, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root microbiome. In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic acid and its derivative 2-keto gluconic acid. Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic acids and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic acid-mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root immunity. Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root microbiome, as it facilitates colonization by beneficial root .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal  were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/B index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate metabolism" were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and energy utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids (caproate, 2-methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic  to increase utilization of carbohydrates and energy, enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Sensitivity to glyphosate varies with bacteria, particularly those residing in the intestine, where  is exposed to glyphosate residues. Therefore, less susceptible pathogenic isolates could have a distinct advantage compared to more sensitive commensal isolates, probably leading to dysbiosis. To determine whether the ruminal growth and survival of pathogenic  or  serovar Typhimurium are higher when glyphosate residues are present in the feed, an  fermentation trial with a "Rumen Simulation System" (RUSITEC) and a glyphosate-containing commercial formulation was performed. Colony forming units of  and  ser. Typhimurium decreased steadily in all fermenters, regardless of the herbicide application. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of the studied  and  strains did not change, and antibiotic susceptibility varied only slightly but independent of the glyphosate application.

We performed a systematic review using the PubMed/Medline database including primary articles written in English that measured leptin production or levels as well as SCFA used as an intervention, mechanism or outcome. The search yielded a total of 573 citations; 36 studies were included in the final analysis. The quality of the studies was analyzed through two validated tools based on objective criteria. Overall, the studies presented low risk of bias to construct and statistical validity. However, the majority presented a high risk of attrition and detection bias. In vitro studies (n = 8) consistently demonstrated that SCFA stimulate leptin expression in adipocytes through activation of free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3). In animal studies (n = 24), interventions to modulate high-fat diet outcomes predominantly caused a decrease in circulating leptin levels and increased SCFA, associated with suppressed weight gain. Control of dysbiosis through administration of prebiotics and probiotics also played a role in leptin synthesis in animal studies. In human studies (n = 4) leptin was mainly correlated with adiposity but dysbiosis interfered with this relationship. We conclude that the association between SCFA and leptin remains incompletely understood but occurs mainly through the activation of FFAR3 in adipocytes. However, body fat rather than SCFA remains the main driver for leptin synthesis in vivo. Future studies should aim to better clarify the role of SCFA in regulating leptin production in vivo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Bulk tank samples were collected from 84 dairy farms using RMS or straw bedding. The use of RMS did not influence thermophilic and mesophilic aerobic viable counts from spores. However, straw-milk samples gave higher values for mesophilic anaerobic spore-forming bacteria (0.44 log cfu/mL) than RMS-milk samples (0.17 log cfu/mL). The presence of thermoresistant lactic acid bacteria was not increased in milk from farms using RMS. Nevertheless, taxonomic profiles of thermoresistant bacteria isolated were different between the 2 types of milk. More Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus spp. were identified in RMS-milk samples. Thermoresistant enterococci and streptococci could easily end up in cheese. Therefore, milk proteolytic activities of these isolates were tested. Neither Streptococcus spp. nor Enterococcus faecium isolates exhibited proteolytic activities, whereas 53% of E. faecalis showed some. Also, only 1 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus was detected. Survival of selected RMS-milk samples isolates (3 E. faecalis and 1 Streptococcus thermophilus) was evaluated during a model Cheddar cheese manufacture. Although those strains survived well, they did not modify the acidification curve of milk. However, they might cause organoleptic defects during cheese maturing.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Our objective was to investigate whether these dysbiotic bacteria act as pathobionts of T. vaginalis infection by altering pathogenic capabilities of the parasite, particularly in regard to adhesion to vaginal substrates and viability of human ectocervical cells. Assays interrogated the performance of T. vaginalis adhesion to biofilm produced by vaginal dysbiotic bacteria and whether these bacteria were capable of altering the ability of the parasite to bind to mucins and cells. The binding activities of T. vaginalis were quantified by flow cytometry. Host cell viability and apoptosis, as affected by T. vaginalis with or without the bacteria, were also measured experimentally. An in vitro biofilm was shown to provide adhesion for T. vaginalis. The binding of parasites to mucins and cells was modulated by the vaginal dysbiotic bacteria. Parasite cytoadhesion was significantly increased by these bacteria. In addition, these bacteria enhanced the pathogenic effects of the parasite to host cells. Together, this study showed that dysbiotic bacteria accompanying T. vaginalis infection in the vagina function as pathobionts as they are capable of enhancing the pathogenic capabilities of this parasite. This study highlights the importance of understanding the contribution of the vaginal microbiome to trichomoniasis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we demonstrate that T cell responses to commensal colonization are associated with the development of organized cellular clusters within the skin epithelium. These organized lymphocyte clusters are surrounded by keratinocytes expressing a discrete program associated with antigen presentation and antimicrobial defense. Notably, IL-22-mediated keratinocyte-intrinsic MHC class II expression was required for the selective accumulation of commensal-induced IFN-γ, but not IL-17A-producing CD4 T cells within the skin.

The purpose of our study was to investigate the effects of omega-7-enriched Decaisnea insignis seed oil (DISO) on reducing TMAO formation to prevent the L-carnitine-induced hepatic damage in mice. Feeding of mice with 3% L-carnitine in drinking water clearly increased the serum and urinary levels of TMAO (p<0.05 vs Normal), whereas the serum and urinary TMAO formation was sharply reduced by DISO administration (p<0.05). Meanwhile, DISO resulted in strong inhibition against the elevation of hepatic injury markers (AST, ALT and ALP) activities and dyslipidemia (TC, TG, LDL-C and HDL-C), as well as liver inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α and TNF-β) release in L-carnitine-fed mice, respectively (p<0.05). As revealed by 16S rDNA gene sequencing, DISO significantly inhibited the L-carnitine-induced elevations in the abundance of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Erysipelotrichaceae, and the increases in the proportion of Lactobacillus and Akkermansia, revealing that DISO attenuated the L-carnitine-caused gut dysbiosis.

It is not necessarily more difficult to measure antimicrobial activity the traditional way, but it is, however, more laborious. In the present study, we developed a new method to measure the antimicrobial activity of LA in multiple samples with a microplate reader. A "test complex" (TC) was produced consisting of 100 μL of agar medium with LA in the bottom layer and 300 μL of broth in the top layer in 96-well deep-well microplates. Afterward, analysis of the broth in the top layer showed that the antimicrobial activity was the same as that of the "control complex," (CC) which consisted of 100 μL of agar medium in the bottom layer and 300 μL of broth with LA in the top layer. Furthermore, evaluation of the antimicrobial effect of the TC when using a microplate reader was the same as that with the use of the colony counting method. The colony counting method has confirmed that the antimicrobial activity of LA when bacteria are inoculated into the broth was equivalent between CC and TC, and we validated this by correlating the number of bacteria with absorbance. In addition, the broth itself in TC was transparent enough that the turbidity of broth can be used as an index of the number of bacteria, which enabled the use of a microplate reader for multiple samples. For human gut microbes, LA was shown to have low antimicrobial activity against commensal lactic acid bacteria, but high antimicrobial activity against pathogenic  and , suggesting that LA might modulate intestinal health, as confirmed by the proposed method.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662860>Fecal  transplantation in irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Modulating gut  is a potential treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

This study investigated the effects of CYP on the intestinal  and gut defence barrier of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). Different groups of experimental fish were fed a normal control diet (NC), a low CYP diet (LYP) and a high CYP diet (HYP) for 8 weeks. After the feeding trial, the fish were assessed for intestinal enzyme activity, intestinal histology, immune-related gene expression, intestinal SCFAs and intestinal . Our results indicated that the intestinal integrity and antioxidant enzyme (CAT and SOD) activity in the common carp were enhanced following CYP supplementation. The mRNA levels of anti-inflammatory (TGF-β), tight binding protein (occludin and ZO-1) and pathway factor genes (TLR4 and NF-κB) were significantly upregulated in the HYP group (P＜0.05), which was accompanied by an increase in the level of pro-inflammatory IL-1β in the gut (P＜0.05). High-throughput sequencing revealed that Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes bacteria were most abundant in the microbial community in the gut of the common carp. The relative abundances of Bacteroides, Flavobacterium and Lactobacillus were increased, while the abundances of pathogenic microorganisms such as Enterobacteriaceae, Shewanella, Pseudomonas and Vibrio were reduced after treatment with CYP. Furthermore, the concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the gut were also increased (P＜0.05). Finally, our results revealed correlations between gut , SCFAs, non-specific immunity and antioxidant enzymes in CYP-fed carp. These results suggest that CYP-supplemented feed could improve the immunity of the common carp by modulating the intestinal microflora and enhancing the gut defence barrier and has the potential to be used as an immunostimulating feed additive in aquaculture.Copyright © 2019.

We sought to develop a three-dimensional gingivae-biofilm interface model using a commercially available gingival epithelium to study the tissue inflammatory response to oral biofilms associated with "health", "gingivitis" and "periodontitis". These biofilms were developed by sequential addition of microorganisms to mimic the formation of supra- and sub-gingival plaque in vivo. Secondly, to mimic the interactions between gingival epithelium and immune cells in vivo, we integrated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD14 monocytes into our three-dimensional model and were able to assess the inflammatory response in the immune cells cultured with and without gingival epithelium. We describe a differential inflammatory response in immune cells cultured with epithelial tissue, and more so following incubation with epithelium stimulated by "gingivitis-associated" biofilm. These results suggest that gingival epithelium-derived soluble mediators may control the inflammatory status of immune cells in vitro, and therefore targeting of the epithelial response may offer novel therapies.

Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) reduces cholesterol via its conversion into bile acids (BAs). During RCT in non-hepatic peripheral tissues, cholesterol is transferred to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and returned to the liver for conversion into BAs predominantly via the rate-limiting enzyme, cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). Numerous reports have described that polyphenol induced increases in BA excretion and corresponding reductions in total and LDL cholesterol in animal and in-vitro studies, but the process whereby this occurs has not been extensively reviewed. There are three main mechanisms by which BA excretion can be augmented: (1) increased expression of CYP7A1; (2) reduced expression of intestinal BA transporters; and (3) changes in the gut . Here we summarise the BA metabolic pathways focusing on CYP7A1, how its gene is regulated via transcription factors, diurnal rhythms, and microRNAs. Importantly, we will address the following questions: (1) Can polyphenols enhance BA secretion by modulating the CYP7A1 biosynthetic pathway? (2) Can polyphenols alter the BA pool via changes in the gut ? (3) Which polyphenols are the most promising candidates for future research? We conclude that while in rodents some polyphenols induce CYP7A1 expression predominantly by the LXRα pathway, in human cells, this may occur through FXR, NF-KB, and ERK signalling. Additionally, gut  is important for the de-conjugation and excretion of BAs. Puerarin, resveratrol, and quercetin are promising candidates for further research in this area.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660354>Corrigendum: The Role of Fecal  Transplantation in Reducing Intestinal Colonization With Antibiotic-Resistant Organisms: The Current Landscape and Future Directions.</a></h1><p>[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1093/ofid/ofz288.][This corrects the article DOI: 10.1093/ofid/ofz288.].© The Author(s) 2019.

The present study aimed to determine the effect of consumption of native chicory inulin on the stool frequency of middle-aged to older adults (40-75 years old) with uncomfortably but not clinically relevant low stool frequency, specified as two to four days without bowel movements per week. Two randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover trials were conducted using similar protocols in differing populations. Trial A was conducted in Amsterdam, The Netherlands and subsequently Trial B was conducted in Newcastle, United Kingdom. Both trials involved supplementation for 5 weeks with 10 g per day of inulin or placebo, a washout period of 2 weeks, and then crossed over to receive the other treatment. In Trial B, faecal gut  composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In Trial A, which 10 volunteers completed, the stool frequency was significantly increased to an average 4.9 ± 0.23 (SEM) times per week during inulin periods versus 3.6 ± 0.25 in the periods with placebo ( = 0.01). In contrast, in Trial B which 20 volunteers completed, there was no significant effect of the inulin on stool frequency (7.5 ± 2.1 times per week with inulin, 8.1 ± 3.0 with placebo,  = 0.35). However, many subjects in Trial B had a stool frequency >5 per week also for the placebo period, in breach of the inclusion criteria. Combining the data of 16 low stool frequency subjects from Trials A and B showed a significant effect of inulin to increase stool frequency from 4.1 to 5.0 per week ( = 0.032). Regarding secondary outcomes, stool consistency was significantly softer with inulin treatment compared to placebo periods, it increased 0.29 on the Bristol stool scale ( = 0.008) when data from all subjects of Trials A and B were combined. No other differences in bowel habit parameters due to inulin consumption were significant. None of the differences in specific bacterial abundance, alpha or beta diversity were significant, however the trends were in directions consistent with published studies on other types of inulin. We conclude that 10 g per day of native chicory inulin can increase stool frequency in subjects with low stool frequency.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665947> transplant therapy and autism: lessons for the clinic.</a></h1><p>: The purpose of this review is to discuss  Transplant Therapy (MTT), a type of intensive intestinal  transplantation (IMT), for people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and chronic gastrointestinal disorders (constipation and/or diarrhea).: This paper briefly reviews IMT, gastrointestinal symptoms and gastrointestinal bacteria in children with ASD, and results and lessons learned from intensive MTT for autism.: An open-label study and a two-year follow-up suggests that MTT is relatively safe and effective in significantly reducing gastrointestinal disorders and autism symptoms, changing the gut microbiome structure, and increasing gut microbial diversity.

Although the exact mechanisms underlying the initial development of IBD are not fully understood, it is believed that an abnormal immune response is elicited against the intestinal  in genetically predisposed individuals. Crucial elements of the etiopathogenesis have been elucidated by research using human biological materials. The estimated prevalence of IBD is 0.5% in the Western world. Although incidence rates are increasing, both conditions are not "common" in general terms mandating a multicentric approach. Biological material from numerous Belgian patients have been collected over time in a number of university hospitals in Belgium (UH Ghent: 800 CD patients, 350 UC patients, 600 normal controls; UH Leuven: 2,600 CD patients, 1,380 UC patients, 98 IC/IBDU patients, 6,260 normal controls). Within the setting of the Flemish Center Medical Innovation (CMI) initiative and later on the Flemish biobank network a prospective study was set-up across three Belgian IBD centers (University Hospitals Brussels, Ghent, and Leuven). Human biological materials and data have been collected prospectively from newly diagnosed CD and UC patients. The analyses hereof have generated new insights which have been published in the most renowned journals. The approach of well-thought off, multi-centric, structured, and systematic biobanking has proven to be a success-story and thus a textbook case for multi-centric banking of human biological materials.

The present trial aims to examine effects of the probiotic  on symptoms of allergic rhinitis in patients. Effects of this probiotic on the immune system have been reported by several studies, but the majority of the previous trials were animal studies. In addition, it is well known that symptoms in allergic rhinitis are prone to exhibit high placebo responses. Moreover, recent studies report that even placebos without deception (open-label placebos) are highly effective in reducing symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Our study design combines both new approaches to assess effects on allergic symptoms in patients. The objective of this study is to compare the effects of a probiotic treatment () with effects seen by open-label placebo, concealed placebo treatment and no treatment control.A total of 120 patients with allergic rhinitis will be randomly assigned to one of four different groups: a double-blind probiotic/placebo group (groups 1 and 2), an open-label placebo group (group 3) and a no-treatment group (group 4) to control for spontaneous variation of symptoms. The primary outcome is the evaluation of allergic symptoms using the Combined Symptoms Medication Score.

Growing evidence suggests that gut  can interfere with chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant drugs, used in the treatment of these diseases, reducing or facilitating drug efficacy. In particular, the effect of intestinal microflora through translocation, immunomodulation, metabolism, enzymatic degradation and reduction of bacterial diversity seems to be one of the reasons of interindividual variability in the therapeutic response. Although the extent of the role of intestinal microflora in chemotherapy and immunosuppression remains still unresolved, current evidence on bacterial compositional shifts will be taken in consideration together with clinical response to drugs for a better and personalized therapy.

Proper integration of various cell signaling pathways and a balanced cross talk between different cell types composing the organ are required to maintain intestinal homeostasis. Dysregulation of this balance can lead to colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we review important insights into molecular and cellular mechanisms of CRC. We discuss how perturbation in complex regulatory networks, including the Wnt, Notch, BMP, and Hedgehog pathways; and how variations in inflammatory signaling, nutrients, and  can affect intestinal homeostasis contributing to the malignant transformation of intestinal cells.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

BZTLF is potentially effective against diabetic vascular complications.Previous studies failed to clarify the molecular mechanism through which BZTLF suppressed diabetic ischemia. In this study, we aimed to explore whether BZTLF treatment could prevent the occurrence of type 2 diabetic (T2D) hindlimb ischemia in mice. Further, we investigated the regulatory effect of BZTLF on angiogenesis-related VEGF signaling pathway and gut  dysfunction in diabetic ischemia mice.C57BL/6J mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) received STZ injection and femoral artery ligation to build T2D diabetic hindlimb ischemia model. Mice were gavaged with BZTLF (5 g [raw materials]/kg/d) or with metformin plus atorvastatin for three weeks. Laser doppler imaging system was utilized for the visualization of blood flow. Histochemistry analysis was performed for microvascular vessel staining. Western blot was applied to detect the protein changes of signaling molecules responsible for VEGF pathway. Finally, 16S rDNA gene sequencing was conducted for analysis of gut  structure.BZTLF treatment remarkably restored blood flow and capillary density of diabetic hindlimb ischemia. And the protein changes of VEGF signaling molecules were reversed in BZTLF-treated diabetic ischemia mice, including the decreased VEGF and HIF-1α, and the increased NO, eNOS and p-ERK1/2. The gut  analysis suggests that BZTLF treatment increased the abundances of several beneficial bacteria (Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides), while decreased the populations of some harmful bacterial (Blautia, Weissella, Escherichia Shigella and Kurthia). By using Spearman correlation analysis, these changed gut flora were positively/negatively correlated with VEGF signaling pathway or glycometabolic parameters.BZTLF displayed beneficial effects on diabetic hindlimb ischemia by reshaping the gut  structure and stunning the VEGF/HIF-1α pathway.Copyright © 2019.

This non-specific response to reinfection is a primitive form of adaptation that has been shown to be conserved from plants to mammals. Insects lack an acquired immune component and rely solely on an innate one, and they have expanded it upon traits of plasticity and adaptation against pathogens in the form of immune priming. The recent discoveries of the role of  in the insect's ecology and the ability of this yeast to induce trained immunity in different organisms suggest that insects could have developed mechanisms of adaptation and immune enhancing. Here, we report that two yeast strains of , previously shown to induce trained immunity in mammals, enhance resistance to  infection in the paper wasp . The reduction of injected  load by  strains was statistically significant in future foundresses but not in workers, and this occurs before and after hibernation. We thus investigated if the effect on  was mirrored by variation in the gut  composition. Foundresses, showing immune enhancing, had statistically significant changes in composition and diversity of gut bacterial communities but not in the fungal communities. Our results demonstrate that  can prime insect responses against bacterial infections, providing an advantage to future foundress wasps to carry these microorganisms. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the generation of specific and long-lasting immune response against pathogenic infections in insects and the influence of the induction of trained immunity on the commensal gut  could have a major impact on modern immunology.Copyright © 2019 Meriggi, Di Paola, Vitali, Rivero, Cappa, Turillazzi, Gori, Dapporto, Beani, Turillazzi and Cavalieri.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665575>Drug-Resistant  Bacteremia Transmitted by Fecal  Transplant.</a></h1><p>Fecal  transplantation (FMT) is an emerging therapy for recurrent or refractory  infection and is being actively investigated for other conditions.

Little is known regarding the changes in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and potential pathogen burden that occur in pediatric recipients of FMT. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in AMR genes, potential pathogens, species, and functional pathways with FMT in children.Nine children with recurrent CDI underwent FMT. Stool was collected from donor and recipient pre-FMT and longitudinally post-FMT for up to 24 weeks. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed. Reads were analyzed using PathoScope 2.0.All children had resolution of CDI. AMR genes decreased post-FMT ( < .001), with a sustained decrease in multidrug resistance genes ( < .001). Tetracycline resistance genes increased post-FMT ( < .001). Very low levels of potential pathogens were identified in donors and recipients, with an overall decrease post-FMT ( < .001).  sp. 109 expanded in all recipients post-FMT, and no recipients had any clinical infection. Alpha diversity was lower in recipients vs donors pre-FMT ( < .001), with an increase post-FMT ( ≤ .002) that was sustained. Beta diversity differed significantly in pre- vs post-FMT recipient samples ( < .001). Bacterial species  and  showed higher abundance in donors than recipients ( = .008 and  = .040, respectively), with expansion post-FMT. Biosynthetic pathways predominated in the donor and increased in the recipient post-FMT.FMT for CDI in children decreases AMR genes and potential pathogens and changes  composition and function. However, acquisition of certain AMR genes post-FMT combined with low levels of potential pathogens found in donors suggests that further study is warranted regarding screening donors using metagenomics sequencing before FMT.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, the underlying mechanism of IBS is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate potential mechanism and novel biomarkers of IBS through evaluation of the metabolomic and microbiologic profile.  Fecal samples were collected from 15 irritable bowel syndrome patients and 15 healthy controls. By using gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) and 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, fecal metabolites and  of healthy controls and the IBS patients were measured.  IBS patients had a significantly differential metabolite profile as compared to healthy controls, and 4 clusters with 31 metabolites, including a group of amino acids and fatty acids, were significantly up-regulated as compared to the healthy controls. In addition, 19 microbes were significantly up-regulated, and 12 microbes were down-regulated in the IBS group, when compared with the healthy controls. Some clusters of fecal metabolites or microorganisms were significantly correlated with the severity of IBS symptoms, such as the frequency of abdominal pain/discomfort and the number of bowel movements. Correlation of the metabolite levels with abundances of microbial genera showed some statistically significant metabolite-microbe associations. Four differentially abundant amino acids clustered together were positively correlated with some microbes, including , and so on.

The oral microbiome shapes the lung microbiome and gut dysbiosis can impact lung diseases; however, relationships of the oral and gut microbiome to COPD in HIV have not been explored.To examine alterations in the oral and gut microbiome associated with pulmonary disease in persons with HIV (PWH).75 PWH and 93 HIV-uninfected men from the Multicenter AIDS cohort study performed pulmonary function testing. Sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA in saliva and stool was performed. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling, permutational multivariate analysis of variance and linear discriminant analysis to analyze communities by HIV and lung function.Oral microbiome composition differed by HIV and smoking status. Alterations of oral microbial communities were observed in PWH with abnormal lung function with increases in relative abundance of Veillonella, Streptococcus and Lactobacillus. There were no significant associations between the oral microbiome and lung function in HIV-uninfected individuals. No associations with HIV status or lung function were seen with the gut microbiome.Alterations of oral  in PWH were related to impaired pulmonary function and to systemic inflammation.

This complexity implies that successful therapies must be directed against several core neuropathological targets rather than single ones. The scientific community has made great efforts to identify the right AD targets beside the historic amyloid-β (Aβ). Neuroinflammation is re-emerging as determinant in the neuropathological process of AD. A new theory, still in its infancy, highlights the role of gut  (GM) in the control of brain development, but also in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Bidirectional communication between the central and the enteric nervous systems, called gut-brain axes, is largely influenced by GM and the immune system is a potential key mediator of this interaction. Growing evidence points to the role of GM in the maturation and activation of host microglia and peripheral immune cells. Several recent studies have found abnormalities in GM (dysbiosis) in AD populations. These observations raise the intriguing question whether and how GM dysbiosis could contribute to AD development through action on the immune system and whether, in a therapeutic prospective, the development of strategies preserving a healthy GM might become a valuable approach to prevent AD. Here, we review the evidence from animal models and humans of the role of GM in neuroinflammation and AD.Copyright © 2019 Cerovic, Forloni and Balducci.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660141>Alternating consumption of β-glucan and quercetin reduces mortality in mice with colorectal cancer.</a></h1><p>The current dietary recommendations for disease prevention and management are scarce and are not well supported. Beta-glucan or quercetin in a diet can alleviate colorectal cancer (CRC) by regulating the gut  and related genes, but the effects of alternating their consumption for routine ingestion during CRC occurrence remain unknown. This study investigated the effects of alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin for routine ingestion on CRC development in mice. The mortality rate, colonic length, inflammatory cytokines, gut , and colonic epithelial gene expression in healthy and CRC mice that consumed normal and alternate diets were compared and studied. The results showed that alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin (alternating among a β-glucan diet, a normal diet and a normal diet that was supplemented with quercetin) alleviated colon damage and reduced the mortality rate in CRC mice, with a reduction in mortality of 12.5%. Alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin significantly decreased the TNF-α level, increased the relative abundance of  and downregulated three genes ( and ) that are associated with inflammation and cancer.

Therefore we want to investigate whether the dCCA has a certain correlation with biliary microecology, and to detect specific strains.A total of 68 adults were enrolled, of whom 8 with dCCA, 16 with recurrent choledocholithiasis, and 44 with the onset of common bile duct stones. Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancretography (ERCP) was utilized to collect bile samples for DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, followed by analysis of bile  composition.First, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria are the most dominant phyla in the bile of patients with dCCA and the onset of common bile duct stoes. Secondly, compared with the onset of common bile duct stones patients, we got a significant increase in the phylum Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae, Chloroflexi, Latescibacteria, and Planctomycetes in dCCA patients. Finally, at the genus level, we obtained sequencing results of 252 bacterial genera from patients with dCCA, recurrent choledocholithiasis, and the new onset of common bile duct stones, revealing heterogeneity among individuals.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the dysbiosis of bile flora in patients with dCCA. This micro-ecological disorder may be a decisive factor in the formation of dCCA. At the same time, for the first time, this study provides a test chart of biliary microbial populations that may be associated with recurrent choledocholithiasis.

However, it remains unclear whether there is any association between the JD and fecal  composition. This cross-sectional study examined the relationship between JD scores and fecal  in young Japanese adults, through the analysis of fecal  using the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) method. JD scores were calculated with regard to nine food groups (rice, miso soup, pickles, green and yellow vegetables, seaweeds, fish, green tea, meat, and coffee) based on a brief self-administered diet-history questionnaire. JD total scores were categorized as low (score 0-3) or high (score 4-8). The high-scoring JD group exhibited a significantly higher relative abundance of Bacteroides than the low JD group, whereas the low JD group exhibited a significantly higher relative abundance of Prevotella than the high JD group. With regard to food group intakes, a higher consumption of rice was associated with a significantly lower relative abundance of Prevotella, whereas a higher consumption of green tea was associated with a significantly higher relative abundance of Bifidobacterium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating an association between JD score and fecal  and may allow the prediction of changes in fecal  due to changes in the JD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674054>Long-term impact of tylosin on fecal  and fecal bile acids of healthy dogs.</a></h1><p>Tylosin is commonly prescribed to dogs with diarrhea.

Lipidomic data were then analyzed using various statistical and bioinformatics tools, which detected numerous lipid species altered by the treatments, and consistently demonstrated interactions between the gut  and the HNaLK diet in altering circulating lipids, mainly triglycerides (TGs). We identified two distinct TG groups, differentially regulated by antibiotic treatment. One group (cluster 1), representing the majority of TG species detected, was downregulated, whereas the other group (cluster 2) was upregulated by antibiotic treatment. Interestingly, cluster 2 TGs were also regulated by the diet. Cluster 2 TGs exhibited greater carbon-chain length and double-bond content and included TGs composed of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, previously associated with reduced diabetes risk.The HNaLK diet interacts with gut bacteria to alter plasma lipid profiles, which may be related to its health effects.

The concept of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), a condition of abnormal proliferation of the small intestine , has been proposed as a form of small intestine dysbiosis. In Parkinson's disease patients, weight loss and metabolic disorders such as lipid abnormalities are frequently encountered. This was a prospective investigation of the presence of SIBO using the lactulose breath test, Parkinson's disease symptoms, medications, abdominal symptoms, and blood data involving 39 Parkinson's disease patients. Of the 39 patients, 19 were positive for SIBO, 16 were negative, and 4 were equivocal. SIBO-positive patients had a significantly smaller dopaminergic drug load (dopamine replacement of Parkinson's disease drug potency) (P = 0.009) and significantly lower serum triglyceride (TG) (P = 0.024) and total bilirubin (P = 0.019) levels. No relationship was seen between the presence or absence of SIBO and motor or abdominal symptoms. The following hypothesis was developed with regard to the possibility that intestinal bacterial overgrowth has various effects that are exhibited via bile acid metabolism in Parkinson's disease patients. Serum bilirubin levels become higher as bilirubin metabolism declines with decreases in the intestinal bacteria. At the same time, bile acid is broken down due to increased intestinal bacteria, and lipid absorption decreases. This induces low serum TG levels and leads to weight loss. By a similar mechanism, there is less absorption of vitamin D as bile acid levels decrease, leading to osteoporosis and fractures. The possibility that some of the non-motor manifestations accompanying Parkinson's disease are caused by intestinal dysbiosis needs to be considered.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Further, fruit waxing is a common practice in wholesale cucumber to preserve the water content of fruit and prolong shelf-life, but its impact on epiphytic  is not well studied. This study investigated the survival of Salmonella Newport and S. Javiana on the surface of six cucumber cultivars of varying surface morphology and the effect of fruit waxing on the persistence of S. Newport. S. Newport and S. Javiana were spot inoculated onto fruit of cultivars 'Marketmore 97', 'Patio Snacker' and 'Corinto' (varieties with trichomes or spines), and 'Bella', 'Pepinex' and 'Summer Dance' (glabrous or smooth varieties). Cucumbers were held at room temperature for 24 h before inoculated sections of exocarp were excised for enteropathogen enumeration. S. Javiana persisted at higher populations than S. Newport (1.0 and 1.5 log CFU g exocarp decline, respectively) after 24 h (P < 0.05). Fruit waxing lessened S. Newport population decline after 24 h on all cultivars tested (P < 0.01). While there was a ~2 log CFU g exocarp decline in populations on unwaxed cucumbers, the reduction on waxed cucumbers was ~1 log CFU g exocarp. A cultivar effect was also observed; 'Summer Dance' supported consistently higher and 'Corinto' and 'Marketmore 97' (though for S. Javiana only) consistently lower Salmonella levels. Cultivars with trichomes were associated with lower populations than glabrous cultivars (P < 0.05). Our data showed that Salmonella persistence on fruit differed for the two serotypes tested and that cultivar differences play a role in determining cucumber surface favourability for pathogen colonization. Additionally, fruit waxing may elevate the risk of Salmonella persistence on cucumber.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To understand larval immune response in the devastating coleopteran insect pest Colorado potato beetle (CPB), we undertook a proteomic analysis of hemolymph of non-treated control larvae and larvae consuming non-lethal doses of spore-crystal mixtures containing the coleopteran-active Cry3Aa toxin. Results revealed lower amount of proteins involved in insect growth and higher amount of immune response-related proteins in challenged insects, sustaining the larval weight loss observed. Additionally, we found a potential regulatory role of the evolutionary conserved miR-8 in the insect's immune response relying on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) production. Upon toxin challenge, different patterns of hemolymph AMPs expression and phenoloxidase activity were observed in CPB larvae reared on different Solanaceae plants. This suggests that diet and diet-associated insect midgut  might modulate this insects' tolerance to non-lethal doses of Bt.Copyright © 2019.

These results may serve as a preliminary assessment to guide future research.Between January and October 2014, stool and blood samples were collected from 53 adult T1DM patients and 53 age- and gender-matched healthy individuals. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes levels were assessed from stool sample DNA and TLR2 and TLR4 expression levels were analyzed via qPCR using RNA from EDTA blood samples from both patients and healthy controls.The amounts of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were statistically significantly higher and lower, respectively, in the T1DM group than in the healthy control group (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). In addition, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratios in patients with T1DM were significantly lower than in healthy controls. The TLR4 and TLR2 gene expression levels in T1DM patients were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively, compared to those in the control group.Our data are the first to show a relationship between T1DM and gut  in our country. In addition, our results provide information about the connections between T1DM, gut , and TLR2 and TLR4 expression. We believe that Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in the gut  may play a role in the autoimmune process of T1DM and that these findings should be further investigated in the future.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, characterizing how microbes interact and work together within closely packed and highly heterogeneous microbial ecosystems is extremely challenging. Here, we describe a rule-of-thumb framework for visualizing polymicrobial interactions and extracting general principles that underlie microbial communities. We integrate elements of metabolic ecology, behavioral ecology, and game theory to quantify the interactive strategies by which microbes at any taxonomic level compete for resources and cooperate symbiotically with each other to form and stabilize ecological communities. We show how the framework can chart an omnidirectional landscape of microbial cooperation and competition that may drive various natural processes. This framework can be implemented into genome-wide association studies to unravel the genetic mechanisms underlying microbial interaction networks and their evolutionary consequences along spatiotemporal gradients. Identifying general biological rules that underlie the complexity and heterogeneity of microbial communities has proven to be highly challenging. We present a rule-of-thumb framework for studying and characterizing how microbes interact with each other across different taxa to determine community behavior and dynamics. This framework is computationally simple but conceptually meaningful, and it can provide a starting point to generate novel biological hypotheses about microbial interactions and explore internal workings of microbial community assembly in depth.Copyright © 2019 Wang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676478>Prophages in  are associated with fitness trade-offs but can increase competitiveness in the gut ecosystem.</a></h1><p>The gut  harbors a diverse phage population that is largely derived from lysogens, which are bacteria that contain dormant phages in their genome. While the diversity of phages in gut ecosystems is getting increasingly well characterized, knowledge is limited how phages contribute to the evolution and ecology of their host bacteria. Here, we show that biologically active prophages are widely distributed in phylogenetically diverse strains of the gut symbiont  Nearly all human- and rodent-derived strains, but less than half of the tested strains of porcine origin, contain active prophages, suggesting different roles of phages in the evolution of host-specific lineages. To gain insight into the ecological role of  phages, we developed strain  6475 as a model to study its phages. After administration to mice,  6475 produces active phages throughout the entire intestinal tract, with the highest number detected in the distal colon. Inactivation of  abolished  phage production, which suggests that activation of the SOS response drives phage production in the gut. In conventional mice, phage production reduces bacterial fitness as fewer wild-type bacteria survive gut transit compared to the mutant lacking prophages. However, in gnotobiotic mice, phage production provides  with a competitive advantage over a sensitive host. Collectively, we uncovered that the presence of prophages, although being associated with a fitness trade-off, can be advantageous for a gut symbiont by killing a competitor strain in its intestinal niche. Bacteriophages derived from lysogens are abundant in gut microbiomes. Currently, mechanistic knowledge is lacking on the ecological ramifications of prophage carriage yet essential to explain the abundance of lysogens in the gut. An extensive screen in the bacterial gut symbiont  revealed that biologically active prophages are widely distributed in this species. In strain  6475, phages are produced throughout the intestinal tract but phage production is associated with reduced fitness of the lysogen. However, phage production provides a competitive advantage in direct competition with a non-lysogenic strain of  that is sensitive to these phages. This combination of increased competition with a fitness trade-off provides a potential explanation for the domination of lysogens in gut ecosystem and how lysogens can co-exist with sensitive hosts.Copyright © 2019 Oh et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656031>Characterization of the gut  in frail elderly patients.</a></h1><p>The change in the composition of gut  has been reported in the elderly and in the frail individuals; however, studies on gut  in frail elderly are limited.This study aimed to investigate the gut  of the frail elderly.From September 2017 to February 2018, 27 elderly patients hospitalized in the Department of Geriatrics of our hospital were enrolled and divided into the frailty group (n = 15) and the control group (n = 12) based on the cutoff of 0.25 for the frailty index. The fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA-amplicon sequencing to analyze the composition and richness of gut . Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering was performed using Usearch software. Intra-sample diversity (alpha-diversity) analysis and inter-sample diversity (beta-diversity) analyses were performed. The community richness was compared between the two groups at family and genus levels.There were 1903 and 1880 OTUs identified in the control and frailty groups, respectively, with 1282 OTUs overlap between the two groups. The alpha diversity of  community was similar between the two groups, whereas the frailty group had larger beta diversity than the control group. The top-10 taxonomy categories and abundances of gut  between the two groups were similar. As for the gut  composition, 4 families and 17 genera were significantly different between the two groups (p < 0.05).These results suggested that frailty can affect gut  diversity and compositions in late elderly hospitalized patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681230>Phylogeography and Ecological Niche Shape the Cichlid Fish Gut  in Central American and African Lakes.</a></h1><p>Cichlid fishes, with their repeated colonization of lakes and subsequent radiations at different scales of phylogenetic and ecological diversification, offer an excellent model system to understand the factors shaping the host-gut  association in nature. Here, we characterized the gut  of the  species complex from Central America (known as the Midas cichlid complex), encompassing 158 wild specimens (13 species) collected from seven Nicaraguan lakes, and combined these data with previously published data from two African lakes (spanning 29 species). Our aim was to comprehensively explore trends in  variation and persistence along the large spatial and temporal scales of cichlid diversification (from the oldest radiation in L. Tanganyika, 9-12 My old, to young ones in Nicaraguan crater lakes, <0.5 My old), in allopatry and sympatry (within and across lakes), and across the range of dietary niches (from highly specialized to generalist feeders). Despite their extraordinary diversity, cichlids shared a remarkably conserved microbial taxonomic profile, which argues for a primary role of the host genetics in the assembly and maintenance of these microbial communities. Within this partly constrained  profile, geographic isolation (continent and lake) represented the first level of discrimination. For the Midas cichlid, a partial congruency was found between host  and genetic distances, suggesting that microbial communities have partly diversified along their cichlid phylogeographic history of crater lake colonization. In sympatry (within lakes), the young and poorly ecologically diversified cichlid assemblages of Central American lakes display largely unresolved gut microbiotas (in terms of both alpha and beta diversities), whereas the phylogenetically and ecologically diverse species found in African lakes showed greater microbial interspecific diversity. This pattern largely points to the level of habitat segregation, trophic niche overlap, and reproductive barriers as major modulators of the gut  connectivity among sympatric species.Copyright © 2019 Baldo, Riera, Salzburger and Barluenga.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664519>Dietary intervention using (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a fungus-derived soluble prebiotic ameliorates high-fat diet-induced metabolic distress and alters beneficially the gut  in mice model.</a></h1><p>Western diet, rich in carbohydrates and fat, is said to be a major factor underlying metabolic syndrome. Interventions with prebiotics, the key modulators of the gut , have paramount impact on host-associated metabolic disorders. Herein, we investigated the effect of fungus-derived (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a highly soluble dietary fiber, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic distress.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with different diet groups (n = 11): control diet, HFD, 3 g/kg or 5 g/kg of β-glucan-incorporated HFD. At the end of experimental study period (12th week), body weight, feces weight and fecal moisture content were observed. Further, colonic motility was measured using activated charcoal meal study. Proteins extracted from liver and intestine tissues were subjected to western blot technique. Paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned for histochemical [Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB) staining] analysis. Fecal  analysis was performed using MOTHUR bioinformatic software.β-glucan consumption exhibited anti-obesity property in mice groups fed with HFD. In addition, β-glucan ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic stress, colonic motility and intestinal atrophy (reduction in colon length, goblet cells, and mucosal layer thickness). Further, β-glucan incorporation shifted bacterial community by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaerostipes, Coprobacillus, and Roseburia and decreasing reportedly obesity-associated bacteria such as Parabacteroides and Lactococcus.Altogether, the outcomes of this present pre-clinical animal study show β-glucan to be a promising therapeutic candidate in the treatment of HFD-induced metabolic distress.

Intestinal dysbiosis plays a key role in the development of colorectal cancer. In the process of carcinogenesis, inflammation, immune response, and toxic metabolites play a significant role. Specific species of bacteria might affect the risk of colorectal cancer and growth of tumor already present. Assessment of changes in the intestinal microbiome during the development and progression of colorectal cancer might create a simple diagnostic tool, a useful biomarker, or might influence treatment strategies in colorectal cancer patients.

Overall, the presence of rectal symptoms did not significantly modify the rectal  profiles among the four groups of analyzed patients. We confirmed that HIV-positive patients are characterized by a lower bacterial richness than HIV-negative subjects.

Theabrownin is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea. Here, we show that theabrownin alters the gut  in mice and humans, predominantly suppressing microbes associated with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Theabrownin increases the levels of ileal conjugated bile acids (BAs) which, in turn, inhibit the intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling pathway, resulting in increased hepatic production and fecal excretion of BAs, reduced hepatic cholesterol, and decreased lipogenesis. The inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling is accompanied by increased gene expression of enzymes in the alternative BA synthetic pathway, production of hepatic chenodeoxycholic acid, activation of hepatic FXR, and hepatic lipolysis. Our results shed light into the mechanisms behind the cholesterol- and lipid-lowering effects of Pu-erh tea, and suggest that decreased intestinal BSH microbes and/or decreased FXR-FGF15 signaling may be potential anti-hypercholesterolemia and anti-hyperlipidemia therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654753>Emerging concepts of mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease progression: Pathogenic and therapeutic implications.</a></h1><p>Mitochondria are very dynamic organelle which plays a multifactorial role for a broad range of physiological processes inside the cell to maintain neural circuit integrity. They are required for the generation of cellular energy, regulation of calcium homeostasis and controlling programmed cell death. Defective mitochondrial homeostasis is frequently reported in a broad range of neurological disorders. Many lines of evidence suggest that it plays an essential role in aging and neurodegeneration. Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and its aetiology is still largely unexplored. Overwhelming evidences indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in PD pathogenesis. Various genes involved in maintaining the mitochondrial homeostasis are also associated with the PD pathophysiology. Alterations in mitochondrial functions such as generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), impaired mitophagy, altered mitochondrial dynamics, impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and Ca buffering may precede the development of PD pathology. In addition, recent studies have also shown the involvement of gut  in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including PD. In this context, mitochondria-targeted therapies that can ameliorate the mitochondrial abnormalities may have great promise in the prevention and treatment of PD. This review aims to discuss the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with PD pathogenesis, influence of microbiome on mitochondrial regulation and various mitochondrial targeted therapies that can improve the mitochondrial function and deplete the severity of the disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society.

Probiotics are used as potential alternatives to antibiotics to prevent NE. It is known that  can act as a probiotic that can prevent infection. However, whether or not it exerts a beneficial effect on NE in chickens remains elusive. Therefore, we investigated the impact of  on immune response and intestinal  during the development of NE in chickens, including experimental stages with basal diets, high-fishmeal-supplementation diets, and  challenge. Chickens were divided into two groups from day 1 to day 20: one group had its diet supplemented with  supplementation and one did not. At day 20, the chickens were divided into four groups:  challenged and unchallenged chickens with and without  supplementation. All groups were fed a basal diet for 13 days and thereafter a basal diet with 50% fishmeal from day 14 to 24. Chickens were infected with  from day 21 to 23. At days 13, 20 and 24, samples were collected for analysis of the relative expression of immune response and intestinal mucosa barrier-related genes and intestinal microbes. The results show that  can inhibit the increase in IL-17A gene expression and the reduction in Claudin-1 gene induced-expression caused by  challenge. Moreover,  was found to increase the expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 in infected chickens. Although  was found to have a significant beneficial effect on the structure of intestinal bacteria in the basal diet groups and decrease the abundance of  in the gut, it did not significantly affect the occurrence of intestinal lesions and did not significantly correct the shift in gut bacterial composition post  infection. In conclusion, although  promotes the expression of anti-inflammatory and tight junction protein genes and inhibits pro-inflammatory genes in challenged chickens, it is not adequate to improve the structure of intestinal  in NE chickens. Therefore, more effective schemes of  supplementation to prevent and treat NE in chickens need to be identified.Copyright © 2019 Huang, Peng, Gao, Wei, Xiang, Yuan and Xu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665573>Fecal  Transplantation for Dysbiosis - Predictable Risks.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670354>Whole barley prevents obesity and dyslipidemia without the involvement of the gut  in germ free C57BL/6J obese mice.</a></h1><p>Whole barley (WB) consumption is the subject of renewed interest because of its health benefits. However, there are still controversies regarding the mechanisms of the anti-obesity effects of WB. The gut  has recently become a focus of research into obesity-related disorders. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of the gut  to the anti-obesity effects of WB. Germ-free (GF) C57BL/6J mice underwent gastric inoculation with human feces to obtain human flora-associated (HFA) mice, and then both the GF and HFA mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) containing 46% WB or refined barley for 9 weeks. Features of obesity and dyslipidemia were compared between the GF and HFA mice and the cecal  was analyzed using next-generation sequencing of microbial 16S rRNA. WB prevents obesity and hypercholesterolemia in the GF and HFA mice. The mechanism may include the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, because sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA) expression was downregulated, and a reduction in cholesterol accumulation, because cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) expression was upregulated, independent of the gut . Furthermore, WB intake enriched a variety of bacterial genera that are negatively associated with obesity, including Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Clostridium cluster XIVa, suggesting that WB counteracted gut dysbiosis in obese mice. Thus, WB helps prevent obesity and dyslipidemia via both gut -dependent and independent mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675589>Effects of cadmium on intestinal histology and  in freshwater crayfish (Procambarus clarkii).</a></h1><p>In this study, Procambarus clarkii (P. clarkii) were exposed to different concentrations (0, 2, 5 and 10 mg/L) of cadmium (Cd).

Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut  is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus.

The first objective of this study was to test this hypothesis if gut  is associated with fish growth rate (body weight). Four full-sibling families were stocked in the same tank and fed an identical diet. Two fast-growing and two slow-growing fish were selected from each family for 16S rRNA  profiling.  diversity varies with different DNA extraction methods. The second objective of this study was to compare the effects of five commonly used DNA extraction methods on the  profiling and to determine the most appropriate extraction method for this study. These methods were Promega-Maxwell, Phenol-chloroform, MO-BIO, Qiagen-Blood/Tissue, and Qiagen-Stool. Methods were compared according to DNA integrity, cost, feasibility and inter-sample variation based on non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (nMDS) clusters.Differences in DNA extraction methods resulted in significant variation in the identification of bacteria that compose the gut . Promega-Maxwell had the lowest inter-sample variation and was therefore used for the subsequent analyses. Beta diversity of the bacterial communities showed significant variation between breeding families but not between the fast- and slow-growing fish. However, an indicator analysis determined that cellulose, amylose degrading and amino acid fermenting bacteria (Clostridium, Leptotrichia, and Peptostreptococcus) are indicator taxa of the fast-growing fish. In contrary, pathogenic bacteria (Corynebacterium and Paeniclostridium) were identified as indicator taxa for the slow-growing fish.DNA extraction methodology should be carefully considered for accurate profiling of the gut . Although the  was not significantly different between the fast- and slow-growing fish groups, some bacterial taxa with functional implications were indicative of fish growth rate.

While accurate identification of pathogens are essential for treatment, not all bacteria are cultivable and the impact of respiratory dysbiosis on development of pneumonia is unclear. The study purposes were to (1) characterize the lung microbiome in canine bacterial pneumonia and compare deviations in dominant microbial populations with historical healthy controls, (2) compare bacteria identified by culture vs. 16S rDNA sequencing from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) culture-, and (3) evaluate similarities in lung and oropharyngeal (OP) microbial communities in community-acquired and secondary bacterial pneumonia. Twenty BALF samples from 15 client-owned dogs diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia were enrolled. From a subset of dogs, OP swabs were collected. Extracted DNA underwent PCR of the 16S rRNA gene. Relative abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were determined. The relative abundance of bacterial community members found in health was decreased in dogs with pneumonia. Taxa identified via culture were not always the dominant phylotype identified with sequencing. Dogs with community-acquired pneumonia were more likely to have overgrowth of a single organism suggesting loss of dominant species associated with health. Dogs with secondary bacterial pneumonia had a greater regional continuity between the upper and lower airways. Collectively, these data suggest that dysbiosis occurs in canine bacterial pneumonia, and culture-independent techniques may provide greater depth of understanding of the changes in bacterial community composition that occur in disease.Copyright © 2019 Vientós-Plotts, Ericsson, Rindt and Reinero.</p></html>
