O-methylguanine (O-Me-G) was used as a simple model adduct to calculate theoretical spectra for comparison with measured high-resolution fragmentation data. An automatic protocol was established to consider the different tautomers accessible at a given  and obtain final theoretical spectra by insertion of an initial tautomer. In the work reported here, the most stable tautomer was chosen as the initial structure, but in general, any structure could be considered. Allowing for the formation of the various possible tautomers during simulation calculations was found to be important to getting a more complete fragmentation spectrum. The calculated theoretical results reproduce the experimental peaks such that it was possible to determine reaction pathways and product structures. The calculated tautomerization network was crucial to correctly identifying all the observed ion peaks, showing that a mobile proton model holds not only for peptide fragmentation but also for nucleobases. Finally, first principles results were compared to simple machine learning fragmentation models.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693969>Energetic, economic and environmental assessment for the anaerobic digestion of pretreated and codigested press mud.</a></h2><p>This study investigates the feasibility of anaerobic digestion (AD) of press mud previously pretreated, using two methods: Liquid Hot Water (LHW) and Thermo-Alkaline (TA), from an economic, energetic and environmental point of view. Two scenarios, a sugar mill with and without distillery were studied, considering monodigestion and vinasse codigestion. The results have shown that the LHW and TA pretreatments are self-sufficient in terms of thermal requirements since they can recover heat from the biogas engine, but the maximum electric and thermal net  (64 MWh d and 95 MWh d, respectively) was obtained during co-digestion with vinasse. The results of the environmental Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) show that the alternatives improve the environmental profiles, in both scenarios. The endpoint impact category "Human health" had the highest contribution because of both: the burning of fossil fuel at refinery to supply the required electricity; and the production of Ca(OH) when vinasse was fed. The AD of pretreated press mud by LHW in CSTR reactors was the most viable for the scenario of a sugar mill without distillery, while the alternative co-digestion with the vinasse of the press mud without pretreatment was the most viable for the scenario of a sugar mill with distillery. This research shows that both the environmental and energetic profiles and the profitability of methane production can improve when the pretreatment and co-digestion of these wastes from the sugar - alcohol production process are considered.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The nanoparticles are considered to be distributed randomly within an implicit solid matrix, but with the easy axes distributed according to particular textures: these are aligned parallel or perpendicular to an external magnetic field, or randomly distributed. The magnetic properties are calculated as functions of the magnetic crystallographic anisotropy barrier (measured with respect to the thermal  by a parameter σ), and the Langevin susceptibility (related to the dipolar coupling constant and the volume fraction). It is shown that the initial susceptibility χ is independent of σ in the random case, an increasing function of σ in the parallel case, and a decreasing function of σ in the perpendicular case. Including particle-particle interactions enhances χ, and especially so in the parallel case. A first-order modified mean-field (MMF1) theory is accurate as compared to the simulation results, except in the parallel case with a large value of σ. These observations can be explained in terms of the range and strength of the (effective) interactions and correlations between particles, and the effects of the orientational degrees of freedom. The full magnetization curves show that a parallel texture enhances the magnetization, while a perpendicular texture suppresses it, with the effects growing with increasing σ. In the random case, while the initial response is independent of σ, the high-field magnetization decreases with increasing σ. These trends can be explained by the  required to rotate the magnetic moments with respect to the easy axes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694009>Technical advances in X-ray microbeam radiation therapy.</a></h2><p>In the last 25 years Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT) has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional radiation therapy at large, third generation synchrotrons. In MRT, a multi-slit collimator modulates a kilovoltage X-ray beam on a micrometer scale, creating peak dose areas with unconventionally high doses of several hundred Grays separated by low dose valley regions, where the dose remains well below the tissue tolerance level. Pre-clinical evidence demonstrates that such beam geometries lead to substantially reduced damage to normal tissue at equal tumour control rates and hence drastically increase the therapeutic window. Although the mechanisms behind MRT are still to be elucidated, previous studies indicate that immune response, tumour microenvironment, and the microvasculature may play a crucial role. Beyond tumour therapy, MRT has also been suggested as a microsurgical tool in neurological disorders and as a primer for drug delivery. The physical properties of MRT demand innovative medical physics and engineering solutions for safe treatment delivery. This article reviews technical developments in MRT and discusses existing solutions for dosimetric validation, reliable treatment planning and safety. Instrumentation at synchrotron facilities, including beam production, collimators and patient positioning systems, is also discussed. Specific solutions reviewed in this article include: dosimetry techniques that can cope with high spatial resolution, low photon energies and extremely high dose rates of up to \SI{15000}{Gy/s}, dose calculation algorithms - apart from pure Monte Carlo Simulations - to overcome the challenge of small voxel sizes and a wide dynamic dose-range, and the use of dose-enhancing nanoparticles to combat the limited penetrability of a kilovoltage  spectrum. Finally, concepts for alternative compact microbeam sources are presented, such as inverse Compton scattering set-ups and carbon nanotube x-ray tubes, that may facilitate the transfer of MRT into a hospital-based clinical environment. Intensive research in recent years has resulted in practical solutions to most of the technical challenges in MRT. Treatment planning, dosimetry and patient safety systems at synchrotrons have matured to a point that first veterinary and clinical studies in MRT are within reach. Should these studies confirm the promising results of pre-clinical studies, the authors are confident that MRT will become an effective new radiotherapy option for certain patients.© 2019 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692336>Exploring Two-Dimensional Materials Thermodynamic Stability via Machine Learning.</a></h2><p>The increasing interest and research on two-dimensional (2D) materials has not yet translated into a reality of diverse materials applications.

Here we use machine learning techniques to identify thermodynamically stable 2D materials, which is the first essential requirement for any application. According to the formation  and  above the convex hull, we classify materials as having low, medium, or high stability. The proposed approach enables the stability evaluation of novel 2D compounds for further detailed investigation of promising candidates, using only composition properties and structural symmetry, without the need for information about atomic positions. We demonstrate the usefulness of the model generating more than a thousand novel compounds, corroborating with DFT calculations the classification for five of these materials. To illustrate the applicability of the stable materials, we then perform a screening of electronic materials suitable for photoelectrocatalytic water splitting, identifying the potential candidate SnSeTe generated by our model, and also PbTe, both not yet reported for this application.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695934>Effect of ground ginger on dough and biscuit characteristics and acrylamide content.</a></h2><p>Effect of different contents of ground ginger [0%, 1%, 3%, 5%, and 7% (w/w)] on flour quality, dough and biscuit characteristic and acrylamide content were investigated. Texture results showed that by adding 1% (w/w) ground ginger, hardness of dough, hardness and chewiness of biscuit decreased, which was beneficial for biscuit making. Moreover, the L* value of biscuit dropped while the a* and b* value rose with the increase of ginger contents, indicating darker, redder and yellower biscuits. Sensory score of biscuits became worse but acrylamide content reduced with the addition of ground ginger. The phenol hydroxyl group of gingerol played a more important role in the reaction of formation of acrylamide than the side chain. Finally, biscuit with 1% ground ginger content showed good texture, color and acceptable sensory evaluation, as well as lowering the acrylamide content by 6.2%.© The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693376>Deterministic deposition of single nano-particles with sub 10 nm resolution.</a></h2><p>Accurate deposition of nanoparticles at defined positions on a substrate is still a challenging task, because it requires simultaneously stable long-range transport and attraction to the target site and precise short-range orientation and deposition. Here we present a method based on geometry-induced  landscapes in a nanofluidic slit for particle manipulation: Brownian motors are used for particle delivery to the target area. At the target site electrostatic trapping localizes and orients the particles. Finally, reducing the gap distance of the slit leads sequentially to a focussing of the particle position and a jump into adhesive contact by several nanometers. For 60 nm gold spheres we obtain a placement accuracy of 8 nm. The versatility of the method is demonstrated further by a stacked assembly of nanorods and the directed deposition of InAs nanowires.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692257>Myokine levels after resistance exercise in young adults with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS).</a></h2><p>Individuals with PWS require marked caloric restriction and daily exercise to prevent morbid obesity. Lower  expenditure, hypotonia, decreased muscle mass, and cognitive impairment make exercise challenging for this population. Exercise guidelines include resistance training as an important component. Myokine responses to resistance exercise may mediate beneficial metabolic effects. We aimed to determine if young PWS adults can perform a resistance exercise program and to measure myokine responses in PWS versus age- and BMI-matched controls. Each group included 11 participants (7M/4F). Ages and BMI for PWS and controls were 30.7 ± 4.6 versus 30.1 ± 4.3 years and 28.3 ± 4.3 versus 28.2 ± 4.2 kg/m , respectively. Glucose, creatine kinase (CK), lactate, and myokines were measured before, after, 30, and 60 min after completing eight resistance exercises. Myokines were assayed using a multiplex myokine panel (Merck Millipore). CK was lower in PWS versus controls (62 ± 16 vs.322 ± 100 U/L, p < .04). Peak lactate was 3.7 ± 0.7 in PWS versus 7.3 ± 0.7 mmol/Lin controls (p < .001). The increase in interleukin-6 was similar in PWS and controls (41 ± 16% and 35 ± 10%, respectively). Pre- and post-exercise levels of the six myokines assayed showed no consistent differences between the PWS and control participants. PWS young adults are capable of performing resistance/strength-building exercise. The lower CK and peak lactate levels in PWS may reflect decreased muscle mass in this population. Further studies are needed to determine optimal exercise regimens and assess the role of myokines incontributing to the metabolic phenotype of PWS.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694008>Prediction of staggered stacking 2D BeP semiconductor with unique anisotropic electronic properties.</a></h2><p>By comprehensive structure design and first-principles calculations, we report a novel two-dimensional (2D) BeP nanomaterial with exotic structural and properties. This BeP 2D material is formed by a couple honeycomb sheets by slab staggered stacking and strong interlayer bondings. It behaves as a natural 2D semiconductor with several notable properties: a modest bandgap (~1.34 eV), high room-temperature electron mobility (~104 cm2 V-1 s-1) and high visible-light absorption coeﬃcient (~105 cm-1); Moreover, due to the unique stacking topology, BeP may display distinctive direction-dependent electric transport by the anisotropic polarity of electron and hole mobilities, that is, it exhibits n-type (electron mobility > hole mobility) along the armchair direction while acts as p-type (hole mobility > electron mobility) in the zigzag direction, thus promising for applications in nanoelectronics. The BeP has good dynamic and thermal stabilities and is also the lowest- structure of 2D space indicated by particle swarm search, implying the high feasibility of experimental synthesis.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692647>Modeling the effect of VOCs from biomass burning emissions on ozone pollution in upper Southeast Asia.</a></h2><p>We used a Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF-CHEM) model that includes anthropogenic emissions from EDGAR-HTAP, biomass burning from FINN, and biogenic emissions from MEGAN to investigate the main volatile organic compound (VOC) ozone precursors during high levels of biomass burning emissions in March 2014 over upper Southeast Asia. A comparison between the model and ground-based measurement data shows that the WRF-CHEM model simulates the precipitation and 2 m temperature reasonably well, with index of agreement (IOA) values ranging from 0.76 to 0.78. Further, the model predicts O, NO, and CO fairly well, with IOA values ranging from 0.50 to 0.57. However, the magnitude of the simulated NO concentration was generally underestimated compared to OMI satellite observations. The model result shows that CO and VOCs such as BIGENE play an important role in atmospheric oxidation to surface O. In addition, biomass burning emissions are responsible for increasing surface O by ∼1 ppmv and increasing the reaction rate of CO and BIGENE by approximately 0.5 × 10 and 1 × 10 molecules/cm/s, respectively, in upper Southeast Asia.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693217>AMPK α1 mediates the protective effect of adiponectin against insulin resistance in INS-1 pancreatic β cells.</a></h2><p>The fat-derived protein adiponectin is known to reverse the effects of insulin resistance and to lower blood glucose levels. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling pathway plays a central role in metabolism and  homeostasis. Here, to investigate the role of AMPK in the protective effect of adiponectin against insulin resistance, we established the model of high-glucose (HG)- and high-lipid (HL)-induced insulin resistance in INS-1 pancreatic β cells. We found that 25mM of glucose and 0.4mM of palmitic acid treatment significantly increased cell apoptosis and impaired insulin secretion in INS-1 cells. However, recombinant human adiponectin dramatically reduced HG- and/or HL-induced cell apoptosis and greatly improved insulin secretion. Interestingly, adiponectin treatment also activated AMPK signalling pathway by increasing the phosphorylation of Thr172 in the AMPK α subunit; 10μM of compound C, a potent AMPK inhibitor, blocked the protective effects of adiponectin against HG/HL-induced insulin resistance. Furthermore, knockout experiments by CRISPR/Cas9 technology showed that AMPK α1, but not AMPK α2, is involved in the protective effects of adiponectin. Taken together, adiponectin reversed the effects of insulin resistance via AMPK α1, which provides a novel insight into the protective mechanism of adiponectin and may be used as a new strategy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Adiponectin can reverse the effects of insulin resistance and lower blood glucose levels. Here, adiponectin reduced HG/HL-induced cell apoptosis and greatly improved insulin secretion. These effects were blocked by AMPK inhibitor, compound C. Specifically, we found that AMPK α1, but not AMPK α2, mediates the protective effects of adiponectin, which provides a novel insight into the protective mechanism of adiponectin against insulin resistance.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696384>Short Report: Social Perception of High School Students with ASD in Norway.</a></h2><p>An increasing number of students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) enroll in inclusive schools and classrooms.

The use of plasma  as a treatment option is a relatively new concept and little data is currently available on this method. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of the use of plasma  in our daily clinical practice by looking at various postoperative outcomes.Twenty-one women previously diagnosed with uni- or bilateral ovarian endometriomas by transvaginal ultrasound, associated with pelvic pain and/or infertility, were included in this retrospective cohort study performed in a tertiary endometriosis referral centre. All women underwent endometriotic cyst ablation using plasma . At follow up postoperative pain, number of days until return to work following surgery, postoperative pregnancy rate and recurrence rate were determined.This study demonstrates a significant decrease in the proportion of patients reporting pain postoperatively when comparing the number of patients with dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain pre- and postoperatively. In addition, the median number of days until women returned to work postoperatively was 9 days (interquartile range (IQR) 8-11 days). The postoperative pregnancy rate was 46.2% (6 of 13 women wishing to conceive) and the recurrence rate was 9.5%.In conclusion, plasma  is a promising alternative to stripping cystectomy, as comparable results for postoperative pregnancy and recurrence rates can be observed. However, further research is necessary to draw firm conclusions when comparing these two techniques.Copyright © 2019 Facts, Views & Vision.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692123>Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics studies of the mechanism of cysteine proteases inhibition by dipeptidyl nitroalkenes.</a></h2><p>In this paper a computational study of the inhibition mechanism of cruzain, rhodesain and cathepsin L cysteine proteases by the dipeptidyl nitroalkene Cbz-Phe-Ala-CH=CH-NO2 has been carried out by means of molecular dynamics simulations with hybrid QM/MM potentials. The free  surfaces confirm the inhibition takes place by the formation of the covalent bond between the protein and the Cβ of the inhibitor. According to the results, the tested inhibitor should be a much more efficient inhibitor of cruzain than of rhodesain, and little activity would be expected for cathepsin L, in total correspondence with the available experimental data. The origin of these differences can be on the different stabilizing electrostatic interactions established between the inhibitors and the residues of the active site and S2 pocket of these enzymes. These results may be useful to the rational design of new dipeptidyl nitroalkenes with higher and selectively inhibitory activity against cysteine proteases.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Estrogen deficiency is the primary reason for trabecular bone loss in postmenopausal women. By reducing estrogen levels aromatase inhibitors (AI) as part of breast cancer therapy promote bone loss. Bisphosphonates (BP) are recommended to counteract this adverse drug effect. The purpose of our study was to quantify VBM proton density fat fraction (PDFF) changes at the lumbar spine using chemical shift encoding-based water-fat MRI (CSE-MRI) and bone mineral density (BMD) changes using dual  X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) related to AI and BP treatment over a 12-month period.Twenty seven postmenopausal breast cancer patients receiving AI therapy were recruited for this study. 22 subjects completed the 12-month study. 14 subjects received AI and BP (AI+BP), 8 subjects received AI without BP (AI-BP). All subjects underwent 3 T MRI. An eight-echo 3D spoiled gradient-echo sequence was used for CSE-based water-fat separation at the lumbar spine to generate PDFF maps. After manual segmentation of the vertebral bodies L1-L5 PDFF values were extracted for each vertebra and averaged for each subject. All subjects underwent DXA of the lumbar spine measuring the average BMD of L1-L4.Baseline age, PDFF and BMD showed no significant difference between the two groups (p > 0.05). There was a relative longitudinal increase in mean PDFF (∆rel) in both groups (AI+BP: 5.93%; AI-BP: 3.11%) which was only significant (p = 0.006) in the AI+BP group. ∆rel showed no significant difference between the two groups (p > 0.05). There was no significant longitudinal change in BMD (p > 0.05).Over a 12-month period, VBM PDFF assessed with CSE-MRI significantly increased in subjects receiving AI and BP. The present results contradict previous results regarding the effect of only BP therapy on bone marrow fat content quantified by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and bone biopsies. Future longer-term follow-up studies are needed to further characterize the effects of combined AI and BP therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693375>Evidence of C-HO Interactions in the Thiophene : Water Complex.</a></h2><p>An analysis of the 1:1 complex of thiophene and water is presented. In this study, computation and matrix isolation FTIR were used to determine stable complexes of thiophene : water. Computational studies found six, low- complexes that were differentiated by the interaction present. Three complexes were characterized by C-HO interactions, one by O-HS, one by O-Hπ, and one with an unusual, dual interaction of O-HS and C-HO. The O-Hπ interaction was found to have the lowest overall  at multiple levels of theory (B3LYP, B3LYP-GD3BJ, B97-D3, M05-2X, ωB97X-D, and MP2). Analysis of matrix isolation FTIR spectra indicated that the primary experimental geometry was a complex where water interacts through C-HO at the α carbon position of the thiophene ring.

To analyse these effects, we implement a methodology to link TIMES  models with life cycle assessment using open-source software. The proposed method uses a cut-off to identify the most relevant processes. These processes have their efficiencies, fuel mixes and emission factors updated to be consistent with the TIMES model. The use of a cut-off criterion reduces exponentially the number of connection points between models, facilitating the analysis of scenarios with a large number of technologies involved. The method is used to assess the potential effects of deploying low-carbon technologies to reduce combustion emissions in the province of Quebec (Canada). In the case of Quebec, the reduction of combustion emissions is largely achieved through electrification of  services. Global warming mitigation efforts reduce the impact on human health and ecosystem quality, mainly because of lower global warming, water scarcity, and metal contamination impacts.

Fused Colloidal Nanopatterning combines directed self-assembly and controlled fusing of spherical colloidal nanoparticles. The two-step approach first patterns a surface covered with hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ), an electron beam resist, forming traps into which the colloidal gold nanoparticles self-assemble. Secondly, the patterned nanoparticles are controllably fused to form plasmon resonators of any 2D designed shape. The heights and widths of the plasmon resonators are determined by the diameter of the nanoparticle building blocks, which can be well below 10 nm. By performing the fusing-step with UV-ozone and heat exposure, we demonstrate that the process is easily scalable to cover large areas on silicon wafers with designed gold nanostructures. The procedure neither requires adhesion layers, nor a lift-off process, making it ideally-suited for plasmonics, in comparison with regular electron beam lithography. We use monochromated electron -loss spectroscopy (EELS) in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) as well as boundary-element method simulations to demonstrate that the designed plasmon resonators are directly tunable via the pattern design. We foresee future expansion of this approach for applications such as plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis, and for large-scale patterning where chemical, optical, or confinement properties require sub-10 nm metal lines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693374>Molecular Basis of DNA Packaging in Bacteria Revealed by All-Atoms Molecular Dynamic Simulations: The case of histone like proteins in Borrelia burgdoferi.</a></h2><p>DNA compaction is essential to ensure the packaging of the genetic material in living cells, and also plays a key role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression.

Many Archaea maintain the fluidity and permeability of their membranes by adjusting the number of cyclic moieties within the cores of their glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) lipids. Cyclized GDGTs increase membrane packing and stability, which has been shown to help cells survive shifts in temperature and pH. However, the extent of this cyclization also varies with growth phase and electron acceptor or donor limitation. These observations indicate a relationship between  metabolism and membrane composition. Here we show that the average degree of GDGT cyclization increases with doubling time in continuous cultures of the thermoacidophile Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (DSM 639). This is consistent with the behavior of a mesoneutrophile, Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1. Together, these results demonstrate that archaeal GDGT distributions can shift in response to electron donor flux and  availability, independent of pH or temperature. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on GDGTs thus capture the  available to microbes, which encompasses fluctuations in temperature and pH, as well as electron donor and acceptor availability. The ability of Archaea to adjust membrane composition and packing may be an important strategy that enables survival during episodes of  stress. This article is protected by copyright.

Specifically, the monthly optimum tilt angle of PV arrays is calculated, which will allow larger quantities of water to be pumped each month. For this, a simple performance optimization procedure is developed using solar radiation data. The investigations are based on the solar radiation data of New Delhi, India. The total amount of water pumped is compared with that by keeping the solar panels fixed throughout the year. The total amount of water that can be extracted by using manually adjustable arrays is found to be greater by 3-5%. This may be an alternative to an automatic sun tracker, which is not only expensive but also requires more space and maintenance. This method allows for analyzing the performance of low-cost water pumping systems that may be used for both domestic and irrigation purposes.© 2019 The Authors.

Firstly we study H 3 C-C models of C-C bonds with frozen HCC angles reproducing the constraints of various degrees of "inversion". Secondly, the molecular orbital (MO) properties of [1.1.1]propellane 1 and [1.1.1]bicyclopentane 2 are analyzed with the help of orbital forces as a criterion of bonding/antibonding character and as a basis to evaluate bond energies. Triplet and cationic state of 1 species are also considered to confirm the bonding/antibonding character of MOs in the parent molecule. These approaches show an essentially non-bonding character of the s central CC interaction in propellane. Within MO theory, this bonding is thus only due to p-type MOs (also called 'banana' MOs or 'bridge' MOs) and its total  is evaluated to ca. 50 kcal/mol. In bicyclopentane 2 , despite a strong s-type repulsion, a weak bonding (15-20 kcal/mol) exists between both central CC, also due to p-type interactions, though no bond is present in the Lewis structure. Overall, the so-called 'inverted' bond, as resulting from a s overlap of the two s-p hybrids by their smaller lobes, appears highly questionable.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Previous studies of the potential for mitigating non-CO GHG emissions in China have focused on timeframes through only 2030, or only on certain sectors or gases. This study uses a novel bottom-up end-use model to estimate mitigation of China's non-CO GHGs under a Mitigation Scenario whereby today's cost-effective and technologically feasible CO and non-CO mitigation measures are deployed through 2050. The study determines that future non-CO GHG emissions are driven largely by industrial and agricultural sources and that China could reduce those emissions by 47% by 2050 while enabling total GHG emissions to peak by 2023. Except for F-gas mitigation, few national or sectoral policies have focused on reducing non-CO GHGs. Policy, market, and other institutional support are needed to realize the cost-effective mitigation potentials identified in this study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693833>Enhanced lipid production of  sp. HS2 using serial optimization and heat shock.</a></h2><p> sp. HS2, which previously showed excellent performance in phototrophic cultivation and has a tolerance for a wide range of salinity, pH, and temperature, was cultivated heterotrophically. The conventional medium was newly optimized based on a composition analysis using elemental analysis and ICP-OES. In addition, in order to maintain a favorable dissolved oxygen level, step-wisely elevated revolutions per minute was adopted. These optimizations led to 40 and 13% increases in the biomass and lipid productivity, respectively (7.0 and 2.25 g Ld each). Furthermore, in order to increase the lipid content, 12 h heat shock at 50 °C was applied and this enhanced the biomass and lipid productivity up to 4 and 17% respectively (7.3 and 2.64 g Ld, each) relative to the optimized conditions above, and the values were 17 and 14% higher than ordinary lipid accumulating N-limitation (6.2 and 2.31 g Ld). On this basis, heat shock was successfully adopted in novel  sp. HS2 cultivation as a lipid inducer for the first time. Considering the fast and cost-effective characteristics, heat shock will enhance the overall microalga based biofuel production process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694184>Extraction of Cellulose Nanofibers via Eco-friendly Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Treatment Followed by Mild Acid Hydrolysis and the Fabrication of Cellulose Nanopapers.</a></h2><p>The conventional isolation of cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) process involves high  input which leads to compromising the pulp fiber's physical and chemical properties, in addition to the issue of elemental chlorine-based bleaching, which is associated with serious environmental issues. This study investigates the characteristic functional properties of CNFs extracted via total chlorine-free (TCF) bleached kenaf fiber followed by an eco-friendly supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO) treatment process. The Fourier transmission infra-red FTIR spectra result gave remarkable effective delignification of the kenaf fiber as the treatment progressed. TEM images showed that the extracted CNFs have a diameter in the range of 10-15 nm and length of up to several micrometers, and thereby proved that the supercritical carbon dioxide pretreatment followed by mild acid hydrolysis is an efficient technique to extract CNFs from the plant biomass. XRD analysis revealed that crystallinity of the fiber was enhanced after each treatment and the obtained crystallinity index of the raw fiber, alkali treated fiber, bleached fiber, and cellulose nanofiber were 33.2%, 54.6%, 88.4%, and 92.8% respectively. SEM images showed that amorphous portions like hemicellulose and lignin were removed completely after the alkali and bleaching treatment, respectively. Moreover, we fabricated a series of cellulose nanopapers using the extracted CNFs suspension via a simple vacuum filtration technique. The fabricated cellulose nanopaper exhibited a good tensile strength of 75.7 MPa at 2.45% strain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694635>Time trends in nutrient intake and dietary patterns among five birth cohorts of 70-year-olds examined 1971-2016: results from the Gothenburg H70 birth cohort studies, Sweden.</a></h2><p>Nutrition is a key factor in healthy ageing but there are still gaps in knowledge about risk- and protective factors linking diet and healthy ageing. The aim of this study was to investigate time trends in dietary patterns and nutrient intake in an older population, in order to increase the understanding of whether dietary recommendations are followed and if nutrient needs are met.Cross-sectional data was derived from five samples of 70-year-olds examined 1971-72, 1981-83, 1992-93, 2000-02 and 2014-16 from the Gothenburg H70 birth cohort studies in Sweden. A total of 2246 individuals (56% women) participated. Dietary intake was determined by the diet history method, which is an interview including questions on usual frequencies and portion sizes of food intake during the preceding three months. Recommended values of nutrient intake and determinants of healthful dietary patterns were based on the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations 2012. Statistical analyses were performed using general linear models, student's t-test and chi-square test, stratified by sex.The intake of fruits and vegetables, fish and seafood, whole grain products and nuts and seeds increased during the study period (p < 0.0001), among both sexes. However, there was also an increase in alcohol intake (p < 0.0001), especially from wine and beer, and in 2014-16 more than 30% had an alcohol intake above recommendations. Protein intake increased (p < 0.0001 for women and p = 0.0004 for men), and 48% of the women and 37% of the men had a protein intake above recommended 1.2 g/kg body weight and day in 2014-16. The proportion of participants at risk of inadequate intake of vitamins C, D and folate decreased during the study period, among both sexes (p < 0.0001). However, vitamin D intake from diet was still below average requirement level of 7.5 μg/day for 49% of the women and 32% of the men in 2014-16.Dietary patterns have changed among 70-year-olds during the past five decades, with an increase in healthful foods and a higher nutrient density in later born birth cohorts. However, the intake of alcohol increased, especially among women. Results from this study can be useful as a basis for dietary guidelines and used for prevention strategies involving older adults in population-based and health care settings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693370>Enhancement of Catalytic Activity of Hetero-Nuclear Bimetallic Cations for the C-H Bond Activation of Cyclohexane.</a></h2><p>Hetero-metallic cations NiCu+, CoNi+ can easily induce triple dehydrogenation of cyclohexane with high yield, mono-metallic cations Ni+, Co+ only give rise to double dehydrogenation with low yield. Reaction mechanisms of the six C-H bonds activation for cyclohexane are systematically investigated by comparing the difference between bimetallic cations and monometallic ones. Fragment molecular orbital (FMO) analysis clearly indicates charge transfer (CT) occurs from the occupied interacting orbital of metallic cation to the σ*-antibonding orbital of the first, third, fifth activated C-H bond in transition states. The synergistic effects of hetero-nuclear bimetallic cations result in the destabilization of occupied interacting orbital in bimetallic cations, which raise the reactivity of bimetallic cations and enhance the CT between catalysts and substrates. Contrary to the absence of the third dehydrogenation product in mono-nuclear metallic cation catalytic reaction, a significant amount of the third dehydrogenation product is observed in the presence of hetero-nuclear cations (NiCu+ and CoNi+). π back-bonding between Ni of hetero-nuclear metallic cations and the substrate cyclohexadiene plays an essential role in lowering the  of transition states, which accelerate the third dehydrogenation. The reason hetero-nuclear bimetallic cations are more reactive than monometallic ones are discussed in detail.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694379>Improved Efficiency in All-Small-Molecule Organic Solar Cells with Ternary Blend of Non-Fullerene Acceptor and Chlorinated and Non-Chlorinated Donors.</a></h2><p>Ternary non-fullerene all-small-molecule organic solar cells (NFSM-OSCs) were developed by incorporating a non-fullerene acceptor (IDIC) and two structurally similar small molecular donors (SM and SM-Cl), where SM-Cl is a novel small molecular donor derived from the reported molecular donor SM. When doping 10% SM-Cl in SM:IDIC binary system, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ternary solar cell was dramatically increased from 9.39% to 10.29%. Characterization studies indicated that the two donors tend to form an alloy state, which effectively down-shifted the HOMO  level of the donor, and thus promoting a higher open-circuit voltage. Interestingly, incorporating a third component (SM-Cl) with lower crystallinity was proven to facilitate the demixing between donors and acceptors, which was in contrary to the traditional findings of enhanced phase separation through incorporation of highly crystalline molecule. Although the morphological modulation had always been a bottleneck issue in NFSM-OSCs, the findings in this work indicated that the modulation on crystallinity deviation between donors and acceptors could be an effective method to further improve the performance of NFSM-OSCs, providing a new perspective on NFSM-OSCs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693371>Doubly charged Small Organic Fragments Derived from [Ce(tripeptide)(CH3CN)m]3+ Complexes: Observation of the Elusive [bn + H]2+ ions.</a></h2><p>[a3 + H]2+ ions generated from Ln3+/tripeptide complexes, where Ln = La or Ce, have similar structures to the linear [an]+ ions but with protonation at both the terminal NH2 and N=CH2 groups. Ion stability is favoured by having the basic secondary amine of the proline residue at the N-terminus and by an amino acid residue accommodating one of the protons on the side chain. Dissociation of [a3 + H]2+ ions derived from peptides containing only aliphatic residues is by cleavage of the second amide bond to give [b2]+ or [a2]+ ions along with internal [a1]+ ions. For [a3 + H]2+ ions containing a tryptophan residue in the central location, in addition to cleavage of the amide bond, losses of neutrals NH3, HN=CHR, (NH3 + CO) and HNCO were observed. Dissociations of some unsolvated Ln3+/tripeptide complexes gave [b3 + H]2+ ions in low abundance; formation of these [b3 + H]2+ ions was favoured by the presence of a proline residue at the N-terminus and by either a histidine or tryptophan residue in the central position. Dissociation of these [b3 + H]2+ ions was by loss of (H2O + CO) and not only CO, indicating that these ions did not have the same type of oxazolone structure as found for [bn]+ ions. DFT calculations suggests that the observed [b3 + H]2+ ions of ProGlyGly were formed from [Ce(ProGlyGly)]3+ complexes in which the peptide was bound to the metal ion as an enolate. Dissociation of the slightly lower  complex, where the peptide is bound in the keto form, would produce an oxazolone but the high barrier required to create this isomer of the [b3 + H]2+ ion would be sufficient to result in further dissociation. Two isomers of the [b3 + H]2+ ion of ProHisGly have been created, one from the [Ce(ProHisGly)]3+ complex that characteristically dissociates by the combined loss of (H2O + CO) and the other by loss of glycine from [ProHisGlyGly + 2H]2+.

The MFC supplement (658 mg flavonoids, split dose 8:30, 13:00) contained quercetin, green tea catechins, and anthocyanins from bilberry extract, and 214 mg caffeine. Participants were measured twice in a metabolic chamber for a day, four weeks apart, with outcomes including 22 h EE (8:30-6:30), substrate utilization from the respiratory quotient (RQ), plasma caffeine levels (16:00), and genotyping for the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs762551. Areas under the curve (AUC) for metabolic data from the MFC and PL trials were calculated using the trapezoid rule, with a mixed linear model (GLM) used to evaluate the overall treatment effect. The 22 h oxygen consumption and EE were significantly higher with MFC than PL (1582 ± 143, 1535 ± 154 kcal/day, respectively,  = 0.003, trial difference of 46.4 ± 57.8 kcal/day). FATox trended higher for MFC when evaluated using GLM (99.2 ± 14.0, 92.4 ± 14.4 g/22 h,  = 0.054). Plasma caffeine levels were significantly higher in the MFC versus PL trial (5031 ± 289, 276 ± 323 ng/mL, respectively,  < 0.001). Trial differences for 22 h EE and plasma caffeine were unrelated after controlling for age and body mass ( = -0.249,  = 0.139), and not different for participants with the homozygous allele 1, A/A, compared to C/A and C/C ( = 0.50 and 0.56, respectively). In conclusion, EE was higher for MFC compared to PL, and similar to effects estimated from previous trials using caffeine alone. A small effect of the MFC on FATox was measured, in contrast to inconsistent findings previously reported for this caffeine dose. The trial variance for 22 h EE was not significantly related to the variance in plasma caffeine levels or CYP1A2*1F allele carriers and non-carriers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694146>Relevance of Leptin and Other Adipokines in Obesity-Associated Cardiovascular Risk.</a></h2><p>Obesity, which is a worldwide epidemic, confers increased risk for multiple serious conditions including type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular diseases. Adipose tissue is considered one of the largest endocrine organs in the body as well as an active tissue for cellular reactions and metabolic homeostasis rather than an inert tissue only for  storage. The functional pleiotropism of adipose tissue relies on its ability to synthesize and release a large number of hormones, cytokines, extracellular matrix proteins, and growth and vasoactive factors, which are collectively called adipokines known to influence a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes. In the obese state, excessive visceral fat accumulation causes adipose tissue dysfunctionality that strongly contributes to the onset of obesity-related comorbidities. The mechanisms underlying adipose tissue dysfunction include adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia, increased inflammation, impaired extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis together with an altered secretion of adipokines. This review describes the relevance of specific adipokines in the obesity-associated cardiovascular disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693952>Trends in ammonia emissions from light-duty gasoline vehicles in China, 1999-2017.</a></h2><p>Ammonia (NH) emitted from motor vehicles is a by-product of measures taken to reduce emissions of other pollutants (e.g. NOx and CO) and has potentially important environmental impacts. NH levels can be impacted by various emission standards. However, there is a lack of investigations of the influences from the implementation of different vehicular emission standards on long-term changes in NH emissions. To fill this gap, we estimated the inter-annual NH emissions of light-duty gasoline vehicles (LDGVs) under different emission standards (State 0 to State V) from 1999 to 2017 and investigated the emission change characteristics under the rapidly developing Chinese economy. Results showed that the NH emissions from LDGVs had a sharp, 42-fold increase (from 1.8Gg to 77.9Gg). However, NH emissions per capita have begun to decrease with increases in socioeconomic development, presenting an inverted U-shaped tendency as a function of per capita GDP. Further exploration indicated that the decline in emission factors, as determined by upgrades in emission standards, was the decisive factor in promoting the downward trend in per capita emissions. This suggests that continuously upgrading emission standards has offset the increase in NH emissions due to the rapid growth of motor vehicles. Quantitative scenario analysis showed a two-stage impact of emission standards on NH emissions: emissions would decrease 77% (48%-90% for different years) if State I and State II were not implemented; while if none of standards were upgraded (State III to State V), NH emissions would increase 118% (13%-224% for different years), 2-6 times the impacts from the growth of vehicle population and the decline of vehicle kilometres traveled. The data and findings in this study can provide scientific support for understanding air pollution in urban areas and for formulating further vehicle pollution mitigation measures in China and other countries.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We tested the associations of usual sleep behavior and bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis. In a sample of 11,084 postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI; mean age 63.3 years, SD = 7.4), we performed a cross-sectional study of the association of self-reported usual hours of sleep and sleep quality (WHI Insomnia Rating Score) with whole body, total hip, femoral neck, and spine BMD using linear regression models. We also studied the association of sleep duration and quality with dual- X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-defined low bone mass (T-score < -2.5 to <-1) and osteoporosis (T-score ≤ -2.5) using multinomial regression models. We adjusted for age, DXA machine, race, menopausal symptoms, education, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, alcohol use, physical function, and sleep medication use. In adjusted linear regression models, women who reported sleeping 5 hours or less per night had on average 0.012 to 0.018 g/cm significantly lower BMD at all four sites compared with women who reported sleeping 7 hours per night (reference). In adjusted multinomial models, women reporting 5 hours or less per night had higher odds of low bone mass and osteoporosis of the hip (odds ratio [OR] = 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.45, and 1.63; 1.15-2.31, respectively). We observed a similar pattern for spine BMD, where women with 5 hours or less per night had higher odds of osteoporosis (adjusted OR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.02-1.60). Associations of sleep quality and DXA BMD failed to reach statistical significance. Short sleep duration was associated with lower BMD and higher risk of osteoporosis. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the cross-sectional effects of sleep duration on bone health and explore associated mechanisms.© 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695892>Transcriptome profiling of maternal stress-induced wing dimorphism in pea aphids.</a></h2><p>Wing dimorphism, that is, wingless and winged forms, can be induced by maternal stress signals and is an adaptive response of aphids to environmental changes. Here, we investigated the ecological and molecular effects of three kinds of stress, namely crowding, predation, and aphid alarm pheromone, on wing dimorphism. These three stressors induced high proportion of up to 60% of winged morphs in offspring. Transcriptome analysis of stress-treated female aphids revealed different changes in maternal gene expression induced by the three stressors. Crowding elicited widespread changes in the expression of genes involved in nutrient accumulation and  mobilization. Distinct from crowding, predation caused dramatic expression changes in cuticle protein (CP) genes. Twenty-three CP genes that belong to CP RR2 subfamily and are highly expressed in legs and embryos were greatly repressed by the presence of ladybird. By contrast, application of alarm pheromone, -β-farnesene, caused slight changes in gene expression. The three factors shared a responsive gene, cuticle protein 43. This study reveals the adaptive response of aphids to environmental stresses and provides a rich resource on genome-wide expression genes for exploring molecular mechanisms of ecological adaptation in aphids.This article has earned an Open Data Badge for making publicly available the digitally-shareable data necessary to reproduce the reported results.

Herein, we successfully achieved multielement-doping and exfoliation for Co3Fe LDHs by one SF6-plasma etching step at room temperature (named as Co3Fe LDHs-SF6). The obtained Co3Fe LDHs-SF6 ultrathin nanosheets display outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, which only needs 268 mV overpotential to reach 10 mA cm-2. Tafel slope and charge transfer resistance are dramatically decreased indicating faster reaction kinetic rate.

In addition, information about the shape and internal defects of crystals allows the optimization of data-collection strategies. Here, it is demonstrated that the X-ray beam available on the macromolecular crystallography beamline P14 at the high-brilliance synchrotron-radiation source PETRA III at DESY, Hamburg, Germany can be used for high- phase-contrast microtomography of protein crystals mounted in an optically opaque lipidic cubic phase matrix. Three-dimensional tomograms have been obtained at X-ray doses that are substantially smaller and on time scales that are substantially shorter than those used for diffraction-scanning approaches that display protein crystals at micrometre resolution. Adding a compound refractive lens as an objective to the imaging setup, two-dimensional imaging at sub-micrometre resolution has been achieved. All experiments were performed on a standard macromolecular crystallography beamline and are compatible with standard diffraction data-collection workflows and apparatus.

It is desirable but remains challenging to develop CNF electrode materials with a large specific surface area (SSA), high specific capacitance (SC) and high power density, as well as excellent cycling stability and high reliability. In this study, we synthesize the acrylonitrile-acrylic acid copolymer P(AN- co -AA) for the preparation of nitrogen-doped microporous CNFs. The thermal degradation of the AA segment leads to the formation of micropores that are distributed not only on the CNF surface but also inside the material. The microporous structure and nitrogen content can be manipulated at the molecular level by adjusting the weight ratio between the AN and AA, and the SSA and SC could reach as high as 1099 m 2 g -1 and 156 F g -1 , respectively. After KOH activation, the Activated Carbon nanofiber (ACNF) possesses an extremely high SSA of 2117 m 2 g -1 and SC of 320 F g -1 , which are almost the highest values ever reported for electric double layer supercapacitors with an alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, the capacitance retention can be maintained at 99% even after 16,000 cyclic tests, exhibiting outstanding durability and repeatability.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The characteristics of the catalyst were studied using field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET),  dispersive X-ray/mapping (EDX/Map), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The result showed that the specific surface area and the average pore diameter of the nanocatalyst were 40.44 m/g and 36.7 nm, respectively, which showed that the catalyst is mesoporous. According to the results of the DLS analysis, the average particle size of the catalyst was determined to be 5.5 nm.

In order to overcome the timescale problem, characteristic of many chemical reactions, we enhanced the sampling of the free  landscape using Metadynamics.

Recently, a new method called Multi-Class Harmonic Linear Discriminant Analysis (MC-HLDA) has been proposed as a tool for constructing collective variables (CVs) for complex chemical processes. The method reduces the dimensionality of the variable space by generating appropriate linear combinations of several relevant chemical descriptors.

Ti3C2 MXene nanosheet with excellent metal conductivity was employed as two-dimensional support to optimize the composite's  band structure. MIL-100(Fe) with a large specific surface area was used as an adsorbent and photocatalytic oxidation center. It was shown that the MIL-100(Fe)/Ti3C2 MXene composite not only has higher thermal stability but also has a significantly increased activity in nitrogen fixation under visible-light. The NO conversion rate of the composite catalyst was about 4 and 3 times higher than that of the pure Ti3C2 MXene as well as the pure MIL-100(Fe) samples, respectively. Although the adsorption mechanism plays an important role in the nitrogen fixation process, it can be concluded that the synergistic effects of the Schottky junctions are the main reason for the enhanced photocatalytic activity.

Initially proposed in the framework of the Hartree-Fock method, the strategy has been gradually extended to other techniques of quantum chemistry, but always remaining limited to a single-determinant ansatz for the wavefunction to extract. This limitation has been recently overcome through the development of the novel X-ray constrained spin-coupled (XCSC) approach [Genoni et al. (2018). Chem. Eur. J. 24, 15507-15511] which merges the XCW philosophy with the traditional spin-coupled strategy of valence bond theory. The main advantage of this new technique is the possibility of extracting traditional chemical descriptors (e.g. resonance structure weights) compatible with the experimental diffraction measurements, without the need to introduce information a priori or perform analyses a posteriori. This paper provides a detailed theoretical derivation of the fundamental equations at the basis of the XCSC method and also introduces a further advancement of its original version, mainly consisting in the use of molecular orbitals resulting from XCW calculations at the Hartree-Fock level to describe the inactive electrons in the XCSC computations. Furthermore, extensive test calculations, which have been performed by exploiting high-resolution X-ray diffraction data for salicylic acid and by adopting different basis sets, are presented and discussed. The computational tests have shown that the new technique does not suffer from particular convergence problems. Moreover, all the XCSC calculations provided resonance structure weights, spin-coupled orbitals and global electron densities slightly different from those resulting from the corresponding unconstrained computations. These discrepancies can be ascribed to the capability of the novel strategy to capture the information intrinsically contained in the experimental data used as external constraints.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695111>Effects of suspended micro- and nanoscale particles on zooplankton functional diversity of drainage system reservoirs at an open-pit mine.</a></h2><p>Water from mining drainage is turbid because of suspensions. We tested the hypothesis that the chemical composition as well as shape and size of particles in suspensions of natural origin affect the density and functional diversity of zooplankton. The suspensions were analyzed with atomic force microscopy (AFM),  dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and optical microscopy. Elements found in the beidellite clays were also identified in the mineral structure of the particles. As the size of the microparticles decreased, the weight proportions of phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine increased in the suspensions. These conditions facilitated the biomass growth of large and small microphages and raptorials. As the size of the nanoparticles decreased, the shares of silicon, aluminum, iron, and magnesium increased. These conditions inhibited raptorials the most. Ecosystem functionality was the highest with intermediate suspension parameters, which were at the lower range of the microphase and the upper range of the nanophase. The functional traits of zooplankton demonstrate their potential for use as sensitive indicators of disruptions in aquatic ecosystems that are linked with the presence of suspensions, and they facilitate gaining an understanding of the causes and scales of the impact of suspensions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693275>Role of endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 enhanced by vildagliptin in the glycaemic and  expenditure responses to intraduodenal fat infusion in type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors prolong the action of endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), the secretion of which is influenced by dietary macronutrients, particularly fat.

On each day, vildagliptin (50mg) or placebo was given orally, followed by intravenous exendin(9-39) (600pmol/kg/min, on 1 of the 2 vildagliptin treatment days) or 0.9% saline over 180min. Between 0-120min, a fat emulsion was infused intraduodenally at 2kcal/min.  expenditure, plasma glucose and glucose-regulatory hormones were evaluated.Intraduodenal fat increased plasma GLP-1 and GIP, insulin and glucagon, and  expenditure, and decreased plasma glucose (all P<0.05). On the two intravenous saline days, plasma glucose and glucagon were lower, plasma intact GLP-1 was higher (all P<0.05), and  expenditure tended to be less after vildagliptin (P=0.08) than placebo. On the two vildagliptin days, plasma glucose, glucagon and GLP-1 (both total and intact), and  expenditure were higher during intravenous exendin(9-39) than saline (all P<0.05).In well controlled T2DM during intraduodenal fat infusion, vildagliptin lowered plasma glucose and glucagon, and tended to decrease  expenditure, effects that were mediated by endogenous GLP-1.

To identify HAMLET's bacterial targets, here we used Streptococcus pneumoniae as a model organism and employed a proteomic approach that identified several potential candidates. Two of these targets were the glycolytic enzymes fructose bis-phosphate aldolase (FBPA) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Treatment of pneumococci with HAMLET immediately inhibited their ATP and lactate production, suggesting that HAMLET inhibits glycolysis. This observation was supported by experiments with recombinant bacterial enzymes, along with biochemical and bacterial viability assays, indicating that HAMLET's activity is partially inhibited by high glucose-mediated stimulation of glycolysis but enhanced in the presence of the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose. Both HAMLET and ALA bound directly to each glycolytic enzyme in solution and solid phase assays and effectively inhibited their enzymatic activities. In contrast, oleic acid alone had little to no inhibitory activity. However, ALA alone also exhibited no bactericidal activity and did not block glycolysis in whole cells, suggesting a role for the lipid moiety in the internalization of HAMLET into the bacterial cells to reach its target(s). This was verified by inhibition of enzyme activity in whole cells after HAMLET but not ALA exposure. The results of this study suggest that part of HAMLET's antibacterial activity relates to its ability to target and inhibit glycolytic enzymes, providing an example of a natural antimicrobial agent that specifically targets glycolysis.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692382>Solution of Ion Channel Flow Using Immersed Boundary-Lattice Boltzmann Methods.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692355>Long Lifetime and Coupling of Acoustic Vibrations of Gold Nanoplates on Unsupported Thin Films.</a></h2><p>Radiation losses due to  transfer to acoustic waves in the surroundings lead to short vibrational lifetimes of plasmonic nanoresonators, and severely limits their applications in quantum technologies and mass sensing. Here we demonstrate a general method for improving the acoustic vibration lifetimes of Au nanoplates (flat structures with edge lengths of several microns and thicknesses of 10 - 40 nm) by using unsupported thin films instead of thick substrates, which blocks the out-going acoustic waves. We experimentally confirm the vibrational quality factor improvement of Au nanoplates on Si3N4 and Al2O3/Si3N4 thin films with thickness less than a hundred nanometer. Through this substrate phonon engineering, we successfully observe strong vibrational coupling between two Au nanoplates. Furthermore, the increased vibrational lifetimes allow us to study the vibrations of the nanoplates relative to the substrate and, for stacked nanoplates, relative to each other. The frequencies of these relative vibrational modes are well described by a simple coupled mass model, which provides the effective spring constants between interfaces separated by surface bonded molecules. We also demonstrate that the continuous thin films can be used for small plasmonic nanostructures (dimensions of several hundred nm), with similar increases in the vibrational lifetimes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694730>Between- and within-herd variation in blood and milk biomarkers in Holstein cows in early lactation.</a></h2><p>Both blood- and milk-based biomarkers have been analysed for decades in research settings, although often only in one herd, and without focus on the variation in the biomarkers that are specifically related to herd or diet. Biomarkers can be used to detect physiological imbalance and disease risk and may have a role in precision livestock farming (PLF). For use in PLF, it is important to quantify normal variation in specific biomarkers and the source of this variation. The objective of this study was to estimate the between- and within-herd variation in a number of blood metabolites (β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), non-esterified fatty acids, glucose and serum IGF-1), milk metabolites (free glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, urea, isocitrate, BHB and uric acid), milk enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase)) and composite indicators for metabolic imbalances (Physiological Imbalance-index and  balance), to help facilitate their adoption within PLF. Blood and milk were sampled from 234 Holstein dairy cows from 6 experimental herds, each in a different European country, and offered a total of 10 different diets. Blood was sampled on 2 occasions at approximately 14 days-in-milk (DIM) and 35 DIM. Milk samples were collected twice weekly (in total 2750 samples) from DIM 1 to 50. Multilevel random regression models were used to estimate the variance components and to calculate the intraclass correlations (ICCs). The ICCs for the milk metabolites, when adjusted for parity and DIM at sampling, demonstrated that between 12% (glucose-6-phosphate) and 46% (urea) of the variation in the metabolites' levels could be associated with the herd-diet combination. Intraclass Correlations related to the herd-diet combination were generally higher for blood metabolites, from 17% (cholesterol) to approximately 46% (BHB and urea). The high ICCs for urea suggest that this biomarker can be used for monitoring on herd level. The low variance within cow for NAGase indicates that few samples would be needed to describe the status and potentially a general reference value could be used. The low ICC for most of the biomarkers and larger within cow variation emphasises that multiple samples would be needed - most likely on the individual cows - for making the biomarkers useful for monitoring. The majority of biomarkers were influenced by parity and DIM which indicate that these should be accounted for if the biomarker should be used for monitoring.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696641>Rational design of Ag-based catalysts for the electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO: a review.</a></h2><p>The selective electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) to CO in aqueous electrolytes has gained significant interest in recent years due to its capability to mitigate the environmental issues associated with CO2 emission and to convert renewable  such as wind and solar power into chemical  as well as its potential to realize the commercial use of CO2. In view of the thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness of CO2 molecule, the exploitation of active, selective, and stable catalysts for the ECR to CO is crucial to promote the reaction efficiency. Indeed, plenty of electrocatalysts for the selective ECR to CO have been explored, of which Ag is known as the most promising electrocatalyst for large-scale ECR to CO due to several competitive advantages including relatively higher catalytic performance, lower price, and richer reserves compared with other metal counterparts. To provide useful guidelines for the further development of efficient catalysts for the ECR to CO, a comprehensive summary of the recent progress of Ag-based electrocatalysts is presented in this review. Different modification strategies of Ag-based electrocatalysts are highlighted, including exposure of crystal facets, tuning of morphology and size, introduction of support materials, alloying with other metals, and surface modification with functional groups. The reaction mechanisms involved in these different modification strategies of Ag-based electrocatalysts are also discussed. Finally, the prospects for the development of next-generation Ag-based electrocatalysts are proposed in an effort to facilitate the industrialization of ECR to CO.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To better understand how sick an athlete will become when they have an infection, a paradigm recently adopted from ecological immunology is presented that includes the concepts of immune resistance (the ability to destroy microbes) and immune tolerance (the ability to dampen defence yet control infection at a non-damaging level). This affords a new theoretical perspective on how nutrition may influence athlete immune health; paving the way for focused research efforts on tolerogenic nutritional supplements to reduce the infection burden in athletes. Looking through this new lens clarifies why nutritional supplements targeted at improving immune resistance in athletes show limited benefits: evidence supporting the old paradigm of immune suppression in athletes is lacking. Indeed, there is limited evidence that the dietary practices of athletes suppress immunity, e.g. low- availability and train- or sleep-low carbohydrate. It goes without saying, irrespective of the dietary preference (omnivorous, vegetarian), that athletes are recommended to follow a balanced diet to avoid a frank deficiency of a nutrient required for proper immune function. The new theoretical perspective provided sharpens the focus on tolerogenic nutritional supplements shown to reduce the infection burden in athletes, e.g. probiotics, vitamin C and vitamin D. Further research should demonstrate the benefits of candidate tolerogenic supplements to reduce infection in athletes; without blunting training adaptations and without side effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695957>Effect of six Korean plants on glucagon like peptide-1 release.</a></h2><p>Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) plays a major role in the regulation of  homeostasis as it causes satiety and suppresses appetite. , , , ,  and  have traditionally been used as famine relief foods in Korea.

Bubble breakup is examined in each level of bifurcation and the transition of breakup regimes is discussed in particular. The pressure variations at the center of different levels of bifurcations are analyzed in an effort to gain further insight into the underlying mechanism of bubble breakup affected by multi-levels of bifurcations in tree-shaped microchannel. The results indicate that due to the structure of the fractal tree-shaped microchannel, both lengths of bubbles and local capillary numbers decrease along the microchannel under a constant inlet capillary number. Hence the transition from the obstructed breakup and obstructed-tunnel combined breakup to coalescence breakup is observed when the bubbles are flowing into a higher level of bifurcations. Compared with the breakup of the bubbles in the higher level of bifurcations, the behaviors of bubbles show stronger periodicity in the lower level of bifurcations. Perturbations grow and magnify along the flow direction and the flow field becomes more chaotic at higher level of bifurcations. Besides, the feedback from the unequal downstream pressure to the upstream lower level of bifurcations affects the bubble breakup and enhances the upstream asymmetrical behaviors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694321>Effect of Heat Stress on Bacterial Composition and Metabolism in the Rumen of Lactating Dairy Cows.</a></h2><p>Heat stress negatively impacts the health and milk production of dairy cows, and ruminal microbial populations play an important role in dairy cattle's milk production. Currently there are no available studies that investigate heat stress-associated changes in the rumen microbiome of lactating dairy cattle. Improved understanding of the link between heat stress and the ruminal microbiome may be beneficial in developing strategies for relieving the influence of heat stress on ruminants by manipulating ruminal microbial composition. In this study, we investigated the ruminal bacterial composition and metabolites in heat stressed and non-heat stressed dairy cows. Eighteen lactating dairy cows were divided into two treatment groups, one with heat stress and one without heat stress. Dry matter intake was measured and rumen fluid from all cows in both groups was collected. The bacterial 16S rRNA genes in the ruminal fluid were sequenced, and the rumen pH and the lactate and acetate of the bacterial metabolites were quantified. Heat stress was associated with significantly decreased dry matter intake and milk production. Rumen pH and rumen acetate concentrations were significantly decreased in the heat stressed group, while ruminal lactate concentration increased. The influence of heat stress on the microbial bacterial community structure was minor. However, heat stress was associated with an increase in lactate producing bacteria (e.g.,  and unclassified ), and with an increase in , , and unclassified , all of which utilize soluble carbohydrates as an  source. The relative abundance of acetate-producing bacterium  decreased during heat stress. We concluded that heat stress is associated with changes in ruminal bacterial composition and metabolites, with more lactate and less acetate-producing species in the population, which potentially negatively affects milk production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693466>Comparison of State Transitions of the Photosynthetic Antennae in Arabidopsis and Barley Plants upon Illumination with Light of Various Intensity.</a></h2><p>Changes in the light  distribution between the photosystems 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2, respectively) due to the reversible migration of a part of the light-harvesting complex (LHC2) between the photosystems (state transitions, ST) have been studied in leaves of barley (Hordeum vulgare) and Arabidopsis thaliana plants upon short-term illumination with light of various intensity that excited predominantly PS2. Changes in the ratio of fluorescence maxima at 745 and 685 nm in the low-temperature (77 K) fluorescence spectrum of chlorophyll a (Chl a) characterizing  absorption by the PS1 and PS2, respectively, were insufficient for revealing the differences in the STs in barley and Arabidopsis plants at various light intensities, because they were not associated with STs at high-intensity illumination. Light-induced accumulation of the LHC2 phosphorylated proteins Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 involved in the relocation of a part of the LHC2 from PS2 to PS1 in the leaves of both plants decreased with the increase in the light intensity and was more pronounced in barley than in Arabidopsis at the same light intensity. Relaxation of the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of Chl a fluorescence after illumination corresponding to the return of the part of LHC2 from PS1 to PS2 was observed in barley leaves in a wider range of increasing light intensities than in Arabidopsis leaves. The differences in the accumulation of phosphorylated Lhcb1 and Lhcb2, as well as in the parameters of NPQ relaxation after illumination, revealed that STs in barley leaves could occur not only at low-but also at high-intensity light, when it is absent in Arabidopsis leaves.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695201>Science and society.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696442>Responses of Vallisneria natans (Lour.)

Herein, a 21-day-long laboratory-scale experiment was designed to explore the growth and physiological responses of Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara (V. natans) to the combined effects of manganese (Mn, 5, 20, and 80 mg L) and pH (pH 4.0, 5.5, and 7.0). Our results showed the combined toxicity intensity was closely related to Mn concentration and the toxicity exhibited by Mn gradually strengthened with the decrease of pH level. High concentration of Mn stress significantly reduced plants leaf area, final leaf number, photosynthetic pigment content, RGR (relative growth rate) and biomass accumulation, but significantly increased the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (HO). At the same time, V. natans plants can resist the adverse stress by activating the antioxidant defense system, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities. Besides, V. natans tended to adjust the biomass allocation strategy and transferred more  to the subsurface and the ramets and stolons parts under the combined stress. This experiment also showed that the increasing pH within a certain range could largely improve the removal rate of Mn (at highest by 84.28%). This may indicate the V. natans plant species can act as a promising tool for the Mn phytoremediation in aquatic environments which needs to be further explored by longer cycle field studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694269>Dielectric and  Storage Properties of BaCaZrTiO (BCZT): A Review.</a></h2><p>The BaCaZrTiO (BCZT), a lead-free ceramic material, has attracted the scientific community since 2009 due to its large piezoelectric coefficient and resulting high dielectric permittivity.

This study examines the linkages between trade openness, CO emissions, and healthcare expenditures in China using time series data for the period 1990-2017. The study extended a theoretical model by adding healthcare expenditures, CO emissions, and trade openness with some constraints. We used simultaneous equation method for the analysis, and the outcomes suggest that trade is significantly affecting the CO emissions in the country, resulting in an increase of healthcare expenditures.

Here, we measure the apparent self-diffusion of solvents saturated within the pores of large single crystals of MOF-5, IRMOF-3 (amino-functionalized MOF-5), and 17 MTV-MOF-5/IRMOF-3 materials at various mole fractions. We find that the apparent self-diffusion coefficient of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) may be tuned linearly between the diffusion coefficients of MOF-5 and IRMOF-3 as a function of the linker mole fraction. We compare a series of solvents at saturation in MOF-5 and IRMOF-3 to elucidate the mechanism by which the linker amino groups tune molecular diffusion. The ratio of the self-diffusion coefficients for solvents in MOF-5 to those in IRMOF-3 is similar across all solvents tested, regardless of solvent polarity.

Perhaps the easiest way to do this would be to modify their training loads, although this advice rarely seems popular with coaches and athletes for obvious reasons. As such, other possibilities to support the athletes' bone health need to be explored. Given that bone is a nutritionally modified tissue and diet has a significant influence on bone health across the lifespan, diet and nutritional composition seem like obvious candidates for manipulation. The nutritional requirements to support the skeleton during growth and development and during ageing are unlikely to be notably different between athletes and the general population, although there are some considerations of specific relevance, including  availability, low carbohydrate availability, protein intake, vitamin D intake and dermal calcium and sodium losses.  availability is important for optimising bone health in the athlete, although normative  balance targets are highly unrealistic for many athletes. The level of  availability beyond which there is no negative effect for the bone needs to be established. On the balance of the available evidence it would seem unlikely that higher animal protein intakes, in the amounts recommended to athletes, are not harmful to bone health, particularly with adequate calcium intake. Dermal calcium losses might be an important consideration for endurance athletes, particularly during long training sessions or events. In these situations, some consideration should be given to pre-exercise calcium feeding. The avoidance of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency is important for the athlete to protect their bone health. There remains a lack of information relating to the longer-term effects of different dietary and nutritional practices on bone health in athletes, something that needs to be addressed before specific guidance can be provided.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694525>De novo Nanopore read quality improvement using deep learning.</a></h2><p>Long read sequencing technologies such as Oxford Nanopore can greatly decrease the complexity of de novo genome assembly and large structural variation identification. Currently Nanopore reads have high error rates, and the errors often cluster into low-quality segments within the reads. The limited sensitivity of existing read-based error correction methods can cause large-scale mis-assemblies in the assembled genomes, motivating further innovation in this area.Here we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based method, called MiniScrub, for identification and subsequent "scrubbing" (removal) of low-quality Nanopore read segments to minimize their interference in downstream assembly process. MiniScrub first generates read-to-read overlaps via MiniMap2, then encodes the overlaps into images, and finally builds CNN models to predict low-quality segments. Applying MiniScrub to real world control datasets under several different parameters, we show that it robustly improves read quality, and improves read error correction in the metagenome setting. Compared to raw reads, de novo genome assembly with scrubbed reads produces many fewer mis-assemblies and large indel errors.MiniScrub is able to robustly improve read quality of Oxford Nanopore reads, especially in the metagenome setting, making it useful for downstream applications such as de novo assembly.

The average diameter of the synthesized AgNPs was calculated to be in the range of 10-25 nm. AgNPs exhibited promising antidiabetic activity as determined by inhibition of α-glucosidase (95.29% inhibition at 10 µg/mL and IC value of 2.10 µg/mL) and cytotoxicity (IC value 4.0 µg/mL as calculated from the slope equation) against HepG2 cells.

It is also frequently used in quantum chemistry-based chemical reaction modeling to predict the solvation contribution to the reactions. The COSMO software, which features the currently most advanced implementation of COSMO-RS, is based on quantum chemical COSMO calculations using the BP functional with the def2-TZVPD basis set. As the accuracy of COSMO-RS depends on the accuracy of the underlying quantum chemical (QC) calculation, it is important to validate the currently used level against other common, presumably superior, approaches such as the more recently developed M06-2x hybrid density functional or wave function methods such as MP2. As compared to other applications where the electronic  is the most important result of the QC calculation, the COSMO-RS method has a much higher dependence on the molecular polarity and thus the electron density distribution. We find that MP2, PBE0, and M06-2x perform slightly worse in fully reparametrized COSMO-RS with respect to the prediction of experimentally measured properties like p or logP. Although MP2 was reported to yield better polarities than most DFT functionals for spin unpolarized molecules, this theoretical advantage does not manifest in a practical benefit for the prediction of thermodynamic properties with a refitted COSMO-RS parameter set. Other pure DFT functionals such as PBE or TPSS can be used instead of BP, but again, no practical advantage is expected as they yield extremely similar polarities to the original BP calculations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692236>Enhancing  Storage Devices with Biomacromolecules in Hybrid Electrodes.</a></h2><p>The development of  storage devices with higher  and power outputs, and long cycling stability is urgently required in the pursuit of the expanding challenges of electrical  storage.

However, loading of atomically dispersed metal on solid supports with high metal contents for practical catalytic applications remains a synthetic bottleneck. Here, we report the use of mesoporous sulfur-doped carbons as supports to achieve high-loading atomically dispersed noble metal catalysts.

Human serum albumin (HSA) is a multi-domain protein that binds various ligands and aids in their transport, distribution, and metabolism in the circulatory system. In the present study, the HSA-EGCg interaction in the absence or presence of fatty acid has been investigated. Förster resonance  transfer (FRET) was used to determine inter- and intra-domain distances in the protein with and without EGCg and palmitic acid (PA). By labeling Cys-34 with 7-(diethyl amino)-4-methylcoumarin 3-maleimide (CPM), the distance between Trp-214 at domain IIA and CPM-Cys-34 at domain IA could be established. A small amount of PA decreased the distance, while a large amount increased the distance up to 5.4 Å. EGCg increased the inter-domain distance in HSA and HSA-PA up to 2.8 and 7.6 Å, respectively. We concluded that PA affects protein conformation more significantly compared to EGCg. Circular dichroism (CD) established that EGCg affects protein secondary structure more significantly than PA. PA had little effect on the α-helix content of HSA, while EGCg decreased the α-helix content in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, EGCg decreased α-helix content in HSA and HSA-PA to the same level. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) data revealed that both PA and EGCg increased HSA aggregation. EGCg increased HSA aggregation more significantly and promoted formation of aggregates that were more heterogenous. Any of these effects could impact the ability of serum albumin to transport and stabilize ligands including EGCg and other polyphenols.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695029>Solar and wind  enhances drought resilience and groundwater sustainability.</a></h2><p>Water scarcity brings tremendous challenges to achieving sustainable development of water resources, food, and  security, as these sectors are often in competition, especially during drought. Overcoming these challenges requires balancing trade-offs between sectors and improving resilience to drought impacts. An under-appreciated factor in managing the water-food- (WFE) nexus is the increased value of solar and wind  (SWE). Here we develop a trade-off frontier framework to quantify the water sustainability value of SWE through a case study in California. We identify development pathways that optimize the economic value of water in competition for  and food production while ensuring sustainable use of groundwater. Our results indicate that in the long term, SWE penetration creates beneficial feedback for the WFE nexus: SWE enhances drought resilience and benefits groundwater sustainability, and in turn, maintaining groundwater at a sustainable level increases the added value of SWE to  and food production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691716>Enhanced visible light photocatalysis by TiO-BN enabled electrospinning of nanofibers for pharmaceutical degradation and wastewater treatment.</a></h2><p>Boron nitride (BN) nanosheets are promising support materials for catalysts. A series of TiO2-BN enabled electrospun nanofibers were synthesized for the photocatalytic treatment of ibuprofen and secondary wastewater effluent under visible light. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the existence of B-O-Ti bonds between the BN nanosheets and TiO2 nanofibers, resulting in  rearrangement, narrowed band gaps, and enhanced light utilization efficiency of the TiO2-BN nanocomposites in the visible light spectrum. Transient photocurrent measurements revealed that the BN enhanced the transport of photogenerated holes from the bulk TiO2 nanofibers to its surface, resulting in more efficient separation and less recombination of the charge carriers. A kinetic study of ibuprofen degradation indicated the enhanced photocatalytic performance of TiO2-BN catalysts with a higher BN content in the nanocomposites. The kinetic rate constant of the TiO2-10% BN catalysts was 10 times higher than that of the pure TiO2 nanofibers. The degradation of organic contaminants in wastewater followed the same trend as ibuprofen and improved with increasing BN content. The stability of the TiO2-BN nanocomposites as an effective solar photocatalyst was demonstrated by multiple cycles of wastewater treatment. The results proved that TiO2-BN is an appealing photocatalyst under visible light.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693115>Unique characteristics of the exoskeleton of Austinograea rodriguez in the Indian Ocean hydrothermal vent (Onnuri Vent Field).</a></h2><p>The Indian Ocean hydrothermal vent is a region where a new oceanic crust is formed by magma at the interface of the deep-sea bed over 2000 m in depth. Here we examined for the first time the exoskeleton structure and mechanical properties of Austinograea rodriguez crabs living in hydrothermal vents. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and  dispersive x-ray (EDX) were used for structural analysis, and a nanoindentation system was used for mechanical analysis. The exoskeleton was divided into four layers: epicuticle, exocuticle, endocuticle, and membrane. The thickness of each layer was different from that of other crustaceans previously reported. Additionally, the number of constituent elements, composition ratio, and hardness of each layer were unique among previously studied crabs. This observation indicates that those characteristics might have evolved for creatures with a hard exoskeleton living in the deep-sea hydrothermal vent.© The Author(s) 2019.

A wealth of information based on robust research evidence can be gleaned from blood tests, including: the identification of iron, vitamin or  deficiency; the identification of oxidative stress and inflammation; and the status of red blood cell populations. Serial blood test data can be used to monitor athletes and make inferences about the efficacy of training interventions, nutritional strategies or indeed the capacity to tolerate training load. Via a profiling and monitoring approach, blood biomarker measurement combined with contextual data has the potential to help athletes avoid injury and illness via adjustments to diet, training load and recovery strategies. Since wide inter-individual variability exists in many biomarkers, clinical population-based reference data can be of limited value in athletes, and statistical methods for longitudinal data are required to identify meaningful changes within an athlete. Data quality is often compromised by poor pre-analytic controls in sport settings. The biotechnology industry is rapidly evolving, providing new technologies and methods, some of which may be well suited to athlete applications in the future. This review provides current perspectives, limitations and recommendations for sports science and sports medicine practitioners using blood profiling and monitoring for nutrition and performance purposes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694291>Nutritional Qualities of Commercial Meal Kit Subscription Services in Australia.</a></h2><p>People are cooking at home less often and relying more on food prepared outside of the home, which is often of less nutritional value than home-cooked meals. The foodservice industry has endeavored to address barriers with the introduction of commercial meal kit subscription services (MKSSs). We aimed to assess and compare the nutritional qualities of MKSSs available in Australia. Average nutritional qualities per serve of 12 recipes (from four weekly boxes of three meals serving two people) were analyzed from five MKKSs (Dinnerly, HelloFresh™, MarleySpoon™, Pepper Leaf, Thomas Farms Kitchen). On average, MKSSs provided adequate serves of core foods, particularly of vegetables (2.3 ± 1.6-3.1 ± 1.8 serves per serve).  content ranged between 2891 ± 539 and 3904 kJ ± 890 per serve. All MKKSs were high in fat (39.5 ± 9.5-59.6 ± 11.2% of ) and sodium (723 ± 404-1426 ± 688 mg per serve). All MKSSs met suggested dietary target level of dietary fiber for women, but none for men. If MKSS providers can modify recipes to reduce added salt and fat and increase dietary fiber, they have the potential to provide both men and women with nutritious meals that more closely align with the dietary guidelines for the prevention of chronic disease, especially if meals are used as an alternative to -dense nutrient-poor takeaway and convenience foods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693930>Immune cell modulation of oligodendrocyte lineage cell.</a></h2><p>Chronic demyelination and the concomitant loss of trophic support and increased  demands in axons are thought to contribute to neurodegeneration in a number of neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Adult oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) play an important role in these demyelinating diseases by generating new myelinating oligodendrocytes that may help limit axonal degeneration. Thus, promoting the differentiation of OPCs and functional integration of newly generated oligodendrocytes is a crucial avenue for the next generation of therapies. Evidence to date suggests that the immune system may both positively and negatively impact OPC differentiation and endogenous remyelination in disease. Inflammatory cytokines not only suppress OPC differentiation but may also directly affect other functions of OPCs. Recent studies have demonstrated that OPCs and oligodendrocytes in both human multiple sclerosis lesions and mouse models of demyelination can express an immunogenic transcriptional signature and upregulate antigen presenting genes. In inflammatory demyelinating mouse models OPCs are capable of presenting antigen and activating CD8 + T cells. Here we review the evidence for this new role of oligodendroglia as antigen presenting cells and how these inflammatory OPCs (iOPCs) and inflammatory oligodendrocytes (iOLs) may influence myelin repair and other disease processes.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, 13-93B3 was incorporated into a commercial PMMA (poly(methyl methacrylate)) bone cement, and the conversion of the glass into a precipitate in solution was investigated with scanning electron microscopy,  dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (spectroscopy)-attenuated total reflection, and micro-Raman spectroscopy. Glass particles of 5, 33, and 100 μm diameter were each mixed with the PMMA cement to create 20, 30, and 40% glass-loaded composites.

According to Traditional Chinese medicine, ginseng is the most widely used "Qi-invigorating" herbs, which provides tonic and preventive effects by resisting oxidative stress, influencing  metabolism, and improving mitochondrial function. Very few reports have systematically measured cell mitochondrial bioenergetics after ginseng treatment.Here, H9C2 cell line, a rat cardiomyoblast, was treated with ginseng extracts having extracted using solvents of different polarity, i.e., water, 50% ethanol, and 90% ethanol, and subsequently, the oxygen consumption rate in healthy and -butyl hydroperoxide-treated live cultures was determined by Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer.The 90% ethanol extracts of ginseng possessed the strongest antioxidative and tonic activities to mitochondrial respiration and therefore provided the best protective effects to H9C2 cardiomyocytes. By increasing the spare respiratory capacity of stressed H9C2 cells up to three-folds of that of healthy cells, the 90% ethanol extracts of ginseng greatly improved the tolerance of myocardial cells to oxidative damage.These results demonstrated that the low polarity extracts of ginseng could be the best extract, as compared with others, in regulating the oxygen consumption rate of cultured cardiomyocytes during mitochondrial respiration.© 2018 The Korean Society of Ginseng, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695789>Yin Yang 1 facilitates hepatocellular carcinoma cell lipid metabolism and tumor progression by inhibiting PGC-1β-induced fatty acid oxidation.</a></h2><p>Lipid accumulation is a driving force in tumor development, as it provides tumor cells with both  and the building blocks of phospholipids for construction of cell membranes. Aberrant homeostasis of lipid metabolism has been observed in various tumors; however, the molecular mechanism has not been fully elucidated.  Yin yang 1 (YY1) expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was analyzed using clinical specimens, and its roles in HCC in lipid metabolism were examined using gain- and loss-of function experiments. The mechanism of YY1 regulation on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1β (PGC-1β) and its downstream genes medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) were investigated using molecular biology and biochemical methods. The role of YY1/ PGC-1β axis in hepatocarcinogenesis was studied using xenograft experiment.  This study showed that YY1 suppresses fatty acid β-oxidation, leading to increase of cellular triglyceride level and lipid accumulation in HCC cells, and subsequently induction of the tumorigenesis potential of HCC cells. Molecular mechanistic study revealed that YY1 blocks the expression of , an activator of fatty acid β-oxidation, by directly binding to its promoter; and thus downregulates PGC-1β/MCAD and PGC1-β/LCAD axis. Importantly, we revealed that YY1 inhibition on  occurs irrespective of the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1-α), enabling it to promote lipid accumulation under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions.  Our study reveals the critical role of YY1/PGC-1β axis in HCC cell lipid metabolism, providing novel insight into the molecular mechanisms associated with tumor cell lipid metabolism, and a new perspective regarding the function of YY1 in tumor progression. Thus, our study provides evidences regarding the potential of YY1 as a target for lipid metabolism-based anti-tumor therapy.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692964>Nanoparticle transport phenomena in confined flows.</a></h2><p>Nanoparticles submerged in confined flow fields occur in several technological applications involving heat and mass transfer in nanoscale systems. Describing the transport with nanoparticles in confined flows poses additional challenges due to the coupling between the thermal effects and fluid forces. Here, we focus on the relevant literature related to Brownian motion, hydrodynamic interactions and transport associated with nanoparticles in confined flows. We review the literature on the several techniques that are based on the principles of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and computational fluid dynamics in order to simultaneously preserve the fluctuation-dissipation relationship and the prevailing hydrodynamic correlations. Through a review of select examples, we discuss the treatments of the temporal dynamics from the colloidal scales to the molecular scales pertaining to nanoscale fluid dynamics and heat transfer. As evident from this review, there, indeed has been little progress made in regard to the accurate modeling of heat transport in nanofluids flowing in confined geometries such as tubes. Therefore the associated mechanisms with such processes remain unexplained. This review has revealed that the information available in open literature on the transport properties of nanofluids is often contradictory and confusing. It has been very difficult to draw definitive conclusions. The quality of work reported on this topic is non-uniform. A significant portion of this review pertains to the treatment of the fluid dynamic aspects of the nanoparticle transport problem. By simultaneously treating the  transport in ways discussed in this review as related to momentum transport, the ultimate goal of understanding nanoscale heat transport in confined flows may be achieved.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694326>Durability of the Exterior Transparent Coatings on Nano-Photostabilized English Oak Wood and Possibility of Its Prediction before Artificial Accelerated Weathering.</a></h2><p>Changes in surface material characteristics can significantly affect the adhesion and overall life of coatings on wood. In order to increase the durability of transparent exterior coatings, it is possible to use the surface modification of wood with UV-stabilizing substances. In this work, selected types of surface modifications using benzotriazoles, HALS, ZnO and TiO nanoparticles, and their combinations were applied to oak wood (, L.). On such modified surfaces, the surface free , roughness, and contact wetting angle with three selected types of exterior transparent coatings were subsequently determined. An oil-based coating, waterborne acrylic thick layer coating, and thin-layer synthetic coating were tested and interaction with the aforementioned surface modifications was investigated after 6 weeks of accelerated artificial weathering. The results of changes in the initially measured surface characteristics of the modified oak wood were compared to the real results of degradation of coatings after artificial accelerated weathering. The positive effect of surface modification, in particular the mixture of benzotriazoles, HALS, and ZnO nanoparticles on all kinds of coatings was proven, and the best results were observed in thick-film waterborne acrylic coating. The changes in the measured surface characteristics corresponded to the observed durability of the coatings only when measured by wetting using drops of the tested coatings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693448>Insulin suppresses transcriptional activity of YAP in insulin target cells.</a></h2><p>Yes-associated protein (YAP), the main transcriptional coactivator of the Hippo pathway, integrates multiple inputs from different signaling cascades. Evidence implicates YAP in the control of cellular nutrient and  status, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Here we show that insulin modulates YAP transcriptional activity in classic insulin target cells, namely HepG2 and C2C12. Insulin increases YAP phosphorylation and significantly decreases YAP abundance in HepG2 cell nuclei. Proximity ligation assay analysis revealed a marked reduction in the interaction of YAP with TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factors in the nuclei of insulin-exposed cells. Consistent with these findings, insulin impaired both YAP/TEAD-mediated transcription and transcription of YAP target genes in HepG2 and C2C12 cells. Serum starvation abrogated the effect of insulin on YAP phosphorylation and YAP transcription. Both the expression of two gluconeogenesis genes, G6PC and PCK1, and the inhibitory effect of insulin on these genes was attenuated in YAP-deficient HepG2 cells. Our results identify insulin as a previously undescribed suppressor of YAP activity in insulin target cells and provide insight into cross talk between the insulin and Hippo pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692965>Prediction and optimization of epoxy adhesive strength from a small dataset through active learning.</a></h2><p>Machine learning is emerging as a powerful tool for the discovery of novel high-performance functional materials. However, experimental datasets in the polymer-science field are typically limited and they are expensive to build. Their size (< 100 samples) limits the development of chemical intuition from experimentalists, as it constrains the use of machine-learning algorithms for extracting relevant information. We tackle this issue to predict and optimize adhesive materials by combining laboratory experimental design, an active learning pipeline and Bayesian optimization. We start from an initial dataset of 32 adhesive samples that were prepared from various molecular-weight bisphenol A-based epoxy resins and polyetheramine curing agents, mixing ratios and curing temperatures, and our data-driven method allows us to propose an optimal preparation of an adhesive material with a very high adhesive joint strength measured at 35.8 ± 1.1 MPa after three active learning cycles (five proposed preparations per cycle). A Gradient boosting machine learning model was used for the successive prediction of the adhesive joint strength in the active learning pipeline, and the model achieved a respectable accuracy with a coefficient of determination, root mean square error and mean absolute error of 0.85, 4.0 MPa and 3.0 MPa, respectively. This study demonstrates the important impact of active learning to accelerate the design and development of tailored highly functional materials from very small datasets.© 2019 The Author(s).

Because capturing loons can be difficult, statistical approaches are needed to evaluate the efficiency of Hg monitoring. Using data from 1998 to 2016 collected in New York's Adirondack Park, we calculated the power to detect temporal changes in loon Hg concentrations and fledging success as a function of sampling intensity. There is a tradeoff between the number of lakes per year and the number of years needed to detect a particular rate of change. For example, a 5% year change in Hg concentration could be detected with a sampling effort of either 15 lakes per year for 10 years, or 5 lakes per year for 15 years, given two loons sampled per lake per year. A 2% year change in fledging success could be detected with a sampling effort of either 40 lakes per year for 15 years, or 30 lakes per year for 20 years. We found that more acidic lakes required greater sampling intensity than less acidic lakes for monitoring Hg concentrations but not for fledging success. Power analysis provides a means to optimize the sampling designs for monitoring loon Hg concentrations and reproductive success. This approach is applicable to other monitoring schemes where cost is an issue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692408>Relationship between metabolic syndrome and acylated/desacylated ghrelin ratio in patients with schizophrenia under olanzapine medication.</a></h2><p>Ghrelin is a peptide hormone that mediates glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Acylated ghrelin (AG) and desacylated ghrelin (DAG) are the two main forms of ghrelin, which have opposing roles in  homeostasis. The AG/DAG ratio has been proposed to be associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the general population. This study compared the relationships between MetS and ghrelin parameters in patients with schizophrenia.Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and under olanzapine monotherapy were recruited. Fasting blood samples were collected for the analyses of metabolic and ghrelin parameters. The serum levels of total ghrelin and AG were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. DAG level was calculated by subtracting the AG level from the total ghrelin level.We recruited 151 subjects with schizophrenia, and classified them into those with MetS ( = 41) and those without MetS ( = 110). Subjects with MetS had a significantly higher AG/DAG ratio, as well as lower total ghrelin and DAG levels. There were no sex differences in ghrelin parameters. The AG/DAG ratio was significantly and positively correlated with weight, body mass index, waist circumference, insulin level, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and number of MetS components. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the number of MetS components remained significantly associated with the AG/DAG ratio.Our results revealed that lower AG/DAG ratios were associated with better metabolic profiles in olanzapine-treated patients with schizophrenia. These observations suggest that the balance between AG and DAG plays a crucial role in the metabolic homeostasis among patients with schizophrenia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692346>A Theoretical Study of PAH Growth by Phenylacetylene Addition.</a></h2><p>Although there were significant advancedment on PAH formation, current mechanisms are still limited in providing an integrated and accurate scheme of PAH yield in combustion conditions, thus more detailed and comprehensive understandings are necessary. This work provides a systematic investigation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) growth by phenylacetylene addition. A combination of the density functional theory (DFT/B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)) and the complete basis set method (CBS-QB3) is performed to calculate the potential  surfaces. The reaction system is initiated by the H elimination reaction of phenylacetylene + H → o-ethynylphenyl + H2, then the addition reaction of phenylacetylene and o-ethynylphenyl can produce PAHs with 1, 2, 3, and 4 rings. The temperature- and pressure-dependent reaction rate coefficients are calculated via a combination of conventional Transition State Theory (TST) and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory with solving Master Equation in the temperature range of 500-2500 K and at the pressure range of 0.01-10 atm. There are 263 species and 65 reactions in this reaction sytem. It shows that the rate constants of this reaction system are highly temperature-dependent, and slightly sensitive to the pressure at temperature lower than 1300 K. To evaluate the yield distributions of various PAH products in the whole reaction network, a closed 0-D batch reactor model in Chemkin is used to calculate the C6H5C2H-C2H2-H-Ar reaction system. The results showed that the prevailing products of this system are 3-ring PAHs with side chain structures. Compared with the traditional HACA pathways, the investigated reaction system presents higher efficiency in large PAH formations, which could subsequently promote the formation of soot particles. The phenylacetylene and o-ethynylphenyl reaction network emphasizes the importance of species with side chain, and it enriches current PAH growth pathways aside from the addition of small species such as C2H2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694051>Demonstration of a relationship between state transitions and photosynthetic efficiency in a higher plant.</a></h2><p>A consequence of the series configuration of PSI and PSII is that imbalanced excitation of the photosystems leads to a reduction in linear electron transport and a drop in photosynthetic efficiency. Achieving balanced excitation is complicated by the distinct nature of the photosystems, which differ in composition, absorption spectra, and intrinsic efficiency, and by a spectrally variable natural environment. The existence of long- and short-term mechanisms which tune the photosynthetic apparatus and redistribute excitation  between the photosystems highlights the importance of maintaining balanced excitation. In the short term, state transitions help restore balance through adjustments which, though not fully characterised, are observable using fluorescence techniques. Upon initiation of a state transition in algae and cyanobacteria, increases in photosynthetic efficiency are observable. However, while higher plants show fluorescence signatures associated with state transitions, no correlation between a state transition and photosynthetic efficiency has been demonstrated. In the present study, state 1 and state 2 were alternately induced in tomato leaves by illuminating leaves produced under artificial sun and shade spectra with a sequence of irradiances extreme in terms of PSI or PSII overexcitation. Light-use efficiency increased in both leaf types during transition from one state to the other with remarkably similar kinetics to that of F'm/Fm, F'o/Fo, and, during the PSII-overexciting irradiance, ΦPSII and qP. We have provided compelling evidence for the first time of a correlation between photosynthetic efficiency and state transitions in a higher plant. The importance of this relationship in natural ecophysiological contexts remains to be elucidated.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693266>Interfacial Lattice-Strain-Driven Generation of Oxygen Vacancies in an Aerobic-Annealed TiO (B) Electrode.</a></h2><p>Oxygen vacancies play crucial roles in defining physical and chemical properties of materials to enhance the performances in electronics, solar cells, catalysis, sensors, and  conversion and storage. Conventional approaches to incorporate oxygen defects mainly rely on reducing the oxygen partial pressure for the removal of product to change the equilibrium position. However, directly affecting reactants to shift the reaction toward generating oxygen vacancies is lacking and to fill this blank in synthetic methodology is very challenging. Here, a strategy is demonstrated to create oxygen vacancies through making the reaction energetically more favorable via applying interfacial strain on reactants by coating, using TiO (B) as a model system. Geometrical phase analysis and density functional theory simulations verify that the formation  of oxygen vacancies is largely decreased under external strain. Benefiting from these, the obtained oxygen-deficient TiO (B) exhibits impressively high level of capacitive charge storage, e.g., ≈53% at 0.5 mV s , far surpassing the ≈31% of the unmodified counterpart. Meanwhile, the modified electrode shows significantly enhanced rate capability delivering a capacity of 112 mAh g at 20 C (≈6.7 A g ), ≈30% higher than air-annealed TiO and comparable to vacuum-calcined TiO .

After excluding those deceased from inciting trauma, pathological and perinatal fractures, 80 patients remained for analysis. Data collected included age, fracture type, displacement, nerve palsy, treatment, complications and time to union. Radiographs were reviewed at the time of injury and at latest follow-up.Of 80 paediatric humeral diaphyseal fractures, 65 (81%) were treated with immobilization. In all, 15 (19%) fractures were treated with surgical stabilization. Most common indications were fracture displacement, open fractures and to improve mobilization in patients with multiple injuries. Fractures were stabilized with a plate (eight), flexible nails (five), external fixation (one) and percutaneous pinning (one). The operative group, compared with the nonoperative group, was older, had more high- mechanisms, more open fractures and increased fracture displacement. All patients in the nonoperative and operative groups went on to union with minimal complications. A nerve palsy was present in five patients (6%)with three of the five involving the radial nerve (4%). All nerve palsies were observed and had full neurological recovery.Over a 20-year period nonoperative management of paediatric humerus shaft fractures was successful in the majority of patients. Operative stabilization, when rarely indicated, had a low complication rate and improved radiographic alignment. All nerve injuries fully recovered without surgical intervention.IV.Copyright © 2019, The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692811>Enabling reversible redox reactions in electrochemical cells using protected LiAl intermetallics as lithium metal anodes.</a></h2><p>Rechargeable electrochemical cells with metallic anodes are of increasing scientific and technological interest.

A primary focus of this paper will be on the physiology of each Triad model with an emphasis on low  availability and its role in reproductive function, with a brief introduction on its effects on bone health in men. From the data reviewed, (i) a specific threshold of  availability below which menstrual disturbances are induced is not supported; (ii) it appears that the energetic, reproductive, and bone systems in men are more resilient to the effects of low  availability compared to those of women, requiring more severe energetic perturbations before alterations are observed; and (iii) it appears that recovery of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis can be observed more quickly in men than in women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694251>Paradox Elimination in Dempster-Shafer Combination Rule with Novel Entropy Function: Application in Decision-Level Multi-Sensor Fusion.</a></h2><p>Multi-sensor data fusion technology in an important tool in building decision-making applications. Modified Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory can handle conflicting sensor inputs and can be applied without any prior information. As a result, DS-based information fusion is very popular in decision-making applications, but original DS theory produces counterintuitive results when combining highly conflicting evidences from multiple sensors. An effective algorithm offering fusion of highly conflicting information in spatial domain is not widely reported in the literature. In this paper, a successful fusion algorithm is proposed which addresses these limitations of the original Dempster-Shafer (DS) framework. A novel entropy function is proposed based on Shannon entropy, which is better at capturing uncertainties compared to Shannon and Deng entropy. An 8-step algorithm has been developed which can eliminate the inherent paradoxes of classical DS theory. Multiple examples are presented to show that the proposed method is effective in handling conflicting information in spatial domain. Simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm has competitive convergence rate and accuracy compared to other methods presented in the literature.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694047>Effects of light and nitrogen availability on photosynthetic efficiency and fatty acid content of three original benthic diatom strains.</a></h2><p>Microalgal biotechnology has gained considerable importance in recent decades. Applications range from simple biomass production for food and animal feed to valuable products for fuel, pharmaceuticals, health, biomolecules and materials relevant to nanotechnology. There are few reports of the exploration of wider microalgae biodiversity in the literature on high value microalgal compounds, however, because it is believed that there is little to be gained in terms of biomass productivity by examining new strains. Still, without diversity, innovation in biotechnology applications is currently limited. Using microalgal diversity is a very promising way to match species and processes for a specific biotechnological application. In this context, three benthic marine diatom strains (Entomoneis paludosa NCC18.2, Nitzschia alexandrina NCC33, and Staurosira sp NCC182) were selected for their lipid production and growth capacities. Using PAM fluorometry and FTIR spectroscopy, this study investigated the impact of nitrogen repletion and depletion as well as light intensity (30, 100, and 400 μmol.photons.m-2.s-1) on their growth, photosynthetic performance and macromolecular content, with the aim of improving the quality of their lipid composition. Results suggest that under high light and nitrogen limitation, the photosynthetic machinery is negatively impacted, leading cells to reduce their growth and accumulate lipids and/or carbohydrates. However, increasing lipid content under stressful conditions does not increase the production of lipids of interest: PUFA, ARA and EPA production decreases. Culture conditions to optimize production of such fatty acids in these three original strains led to a balance between economic and ecophysiological constraints: low light and no nitrogen limitation led to better photosynthetic capacities associated with  savings, and hence a more profitable approach.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692344>Polarizable Embedding with a Transferable HO Potential Function II: Application to (HO) Clusters & Liquid Water.</a></h2><p>The incorporation of polarization in multiscale quantum-mechanics / molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) simulations is important for a variety of applications, e.g. charge-transfer reactions. A recently developed formalism based on a density functional theory description of the QM region and a potential  function for HO molecules that includes quadrupole as well as dipole polarizability of the MM region is used to simulate liquid water and water clusters. Analysis of the , atomic forces, MM polarization, and structure is presented. A quantitative assessment of the QM/MM-MM/MM interaction  differences of all possible QM/MM configurations of (HO) clusters shows that the interquartile range of the distributions of the QM/MM binding energies are never more than 20 meV/molecule higher or lower than the binding energies produced with either of the single-model results. Comparing these interaction  differences with the QM/MM induction differences show that they are not systematically caused by the induced MM moments of our polarizable embedding scheme. Optimized hexamer geometries as well as liquid water structure are shown to be improved in comparison with results obtained using point-charge based embedding models neglecting polarization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692556>Aging-associated impairment in metabolic compensation by subcutaneous adipose tissue promotes diet-induced fatty liver disease in mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, and its progression is associated with aging-associated impairment in metabolic homeostasis. Recently,  metabolism in adipose tissue has been the subject of renewed interest, because significant  expenditure can be induced in cells derived from white adipose tissue progenitors, in addition to brown adipose tissue (BAT). Here we evaluated whether aging-associated change in various adipose tissue depots affects the progression of NAFLD.Six-week-old male C57BL/6NCrSlc mice were fed control chow (C) or high-fat diet (60% fat; HF) for 12 or 24 weeks (12w/C, 12w/HF, 24w/C and 24w/HF groups, respectively) or switched from C to HF diet at 18 weeks of age (24w/C/HF group) and fed for a further 24 weeks. Some 24w/HF mice received a subcutaneous transplantation of adipose progenitors (10 cells/mouse) from young donor mice. Basal  expenditure, glucose tolerance, and liver and adipose tissue histology were then evaluated. In addition, features of senescence and the capacity of adipose progenitors to "brown" were compared in mice of various ages.12w/HF mice demonstrated compensation in the forms of hypertrophy of interscapular classical BAT and the appearance of subcutaneous beige adipocytes, consistent with improved metabolic homeostasis. In contrast, 24w/HF and 24w/C/HF mice developed obesity, glucose intolerance, and severe NAFLD, with accelerated senescence and loss of adipose progenitors in subcutaneous fat tissues. Recruitment of adipose progenitors ameliorated these findings in 24w/HF mice.Impaired metabolic compensation in adipose tissue resulted in the progression of NAFLD, which was associated with aging-related deterioration in adipose progenitors. A new approach targeting adipose tissue progenitors might represent a potential strategy for the prevention of NAFLD.© 2019 Taketani et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696283>Characterization of cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase from Tribolium castaneum and its application in the production of β-alanine.</a></h2><p>β-alanine is a precursor for the production of pharmaceuticals and food additives that is produced by chemical methods in industry. As concerns about the environment and  are increasing, biocatalysis using L-aspartate-α-decarboxylase (ADC) to convert L-aspartate to β-alanine has great potential. Many studies have focused on the catalytic activity of ADC, but these researches were limited to the prokaryotic enzymes. In this study, the gene encoding cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase from Tribolium castaneum (TcCSADC) was synthesized and overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the enzyme was purified and characterized for the first time. It could use L-aspartate as its substrate, and the specific activity was 4.83 μmol/min/mg, which was much higher than that of ADCs from prokaryotes. A homology modeling assay indicated that TcCSADC had a dimer structure. Based on the evolutionary information from thermophilic bacteria, twenty-three variants were constructed to attempt to improve its abilities that transform L-aspartate to β-alanine. One mutant, G369A, was screened that had improved thermal stability. An analysis of the suitability of the catalytic process showed that the up to 162 g/L β-alanine could be produced using cells expressing the recombinant G369A variant, which is the highest yield to date. The CSADC from T. castaneum has important value for studies of the mechanism of ADCs and CSADCs from eukaryotes, and the engineered strain containing the G369A variant has great potential for the industrial production of β-alanine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693846>Relationship Between Performance Improvement in Activities of Daily Living and  Intake in Older Patients With Hip Fracture Undergoing Rehabilitation.</a></h2><p>To analyze whether sufficient  intake (EI) improves performance of activities of daily living (ADL) in patients with hip fracture admitted to rehabilitation hospitals. The adequate amount of EI for improving performance of ADL in patients with hip fracture remains unknown.This retrospective cohort study included all patients with hip fracture (n=234) admitted to rehabilitation hospitals in Japan. The inclusion criteria for this study were age >65 years and body mass index <30.0 kg/m2. Patients who were transferred to an acute hospital and those with missing case data were excluded. According to the amount of EI, the patients were classified into  sufficiency and shortage groups (EI/total  expenditure ≥1.0 and <1.0, respectively). The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and FIM gain were used to evaluate the patient disability level and change in patient status in response to rehabilitation. Finally, FIM gain was calculated as the discharge FIM score minus the admission FIM score.The final analysis targeted 202 patients-53 (26.2%) were in the  shortage group and 149 (73.8%) were in the  sufficiency group. The  sufficiency group had a greater FIM gain than the  shortage group (mean, 25.1±14.2 vs. 19.7±16.4; p=0.024). Furthermore, sufficient EI in the first week since admission (β=0.165; 95% confidence interval, 0.392-5.230; p=0.023) was an independent factor of FIM gain.Among elderly patients with hip fracture admitted to rehabilitation hospitals in Japan, the amount of EI during the first week after admission was an independent factor of FIM gain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692351>Structural and Electronic Optimization of MoS Edges for Hydrogen Evolution.</a></h2><p>The activity and accessibility of MoS edge sites are critical to deliver high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiency. Here, a porous carbon network confining ultrasmall N-doped MoS nanocrystals (N-MoS/CN) is fabricated by a self-templating strategy, which realizes synergistically structural and electronic modulations of MoS edges. Experiments and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the N dopants could activate MoS edges for HER, while the porous carbon network could deliver high accessibility of the active sites from N-MoS nanocrystals. Consequently, N-MoS/CN possesses superior HER activity with an overpotential of 114 mV at 10 mA cm and excellent stability over 10 h, delivering one of best MoS-based HER electrocatalysts. Moreover, this study opens a new venue for optimizing materials with enhanced accessible catalytic sites for -related applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691843>Simultaneous PET-MRI imaging of cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism in the symptomatic unilateral internal carotid artery/middle cerebral artery steno-occlusive disease.</a></h2><p>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and glucose metabolism are important and significant factors in ischaemic cerebrovascular disease. The objective of this study was to use quantitative hybrid PET/MR to evaluate the effects of surgery treatment on the symptomatic unilateral internal carotid artery/middle cerebral artery steno-occlusive disease.Fifteen patients diagnosed with ischaemic cerebrovascular disease were evaluated using a hybrid TOF PET/MR system (Signa, GE Healthcare). The CBF value measured by arterial spin labelling (ASL) and the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) measured by F-FDG PET were obtained, except for the infarct area and its contralateral side, before and after bypass surgery. The asymmetry index (AI) was calculated from the CBF and SUVR of the ipsilateral and contralateral cerebral hemispheres, respectively. The ΔCBF and ΔSUVR were calculated as the percent changes of CBF and SUVR between before and after surgery, and paired t tests were used to determine whether a significant change occurred. Spearman's rank correlation was also used to compare CBF with glucose metabolism in the same region.The analysis primarily revealed that after bypass surgery, a statistically significant increase occurred in the CBF on the affected side (P < 0.01). The postprocedural SUVR was not significantly higher than the preprocedural SUVR (P > 0.05). However, the postprocedural AI values for CBF and SUVR were significantly lower after surgery than before surgery (P < 0.01). A significant correlation was found between the AI values for preoperative CBF and SUVR on the ipsilateral hemisphere (P < 0.01).The present study demonstrates that a combination of ASL and F-FDG PET could be used to simultaneously analyse changes in patients' cerebral haemodynamic patterns and metabolism between before and after superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass surgery. This therefore represents an essential tool for the evaluation of critical haemodynamic and metabolic status in patients with symptomatic unilateral ischaemic cerebrovascular disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696309>[Catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias : Forms of  and biophysical principles].</a></h2><p>Catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias has evolved over the years and has become a cornerstone in the modern treatment of various supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. The goal of ablation is to permanently damage myocardium that is critically involved in the individual arrhythmia mechanism. Different catheters and forms of  are available. Radiofrequency (RF) ablation is most common. Application of an alternating current at the catheter tip induces heating of tissue and, thus, leads to ablation of a targeted arrhythmogenic substrate. High temperatures (>70 °C at the catheter tip and >95 °C within the tissue) bear the risk of coagulum formation and steam pops and should be avoided, which limits power application. The evolution of irrigated RF ablation catheters enables the transfer of more power to the tissue and thereby increases the dimensions of the lesions. Cryoablation represents a valuable alternative. Cooling of tissue to -80 °C causes the intra- and extracellular formation of ice crystals, finally resulting in a dense circumscribed scar. The cryomapping procedure grants improved surveillance of the safety of ablation. Cryoenergy is very popular for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) using the cryoballoon. In addition to the laser balloon that is established for PVI, ultrasound, microwaves, and stereotactic irradiation complete the arsenal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692147>Constructing Metastructures with Broadband Electromagnetic Functionality.</a></h2><p>Electromagnetic metastructures stand for the artificial structures with a characteristic size smaller than the wavelength, which may efficiently manipulate the states of light. However, their applications are often restricted by the bandwidth of the electromagnetic response of the metastructures. It is therefore essential to reassert the principles in constructing broadband electromagnetic metastructures. Herein, after summarizing the conventional approaches for achieving broadband electromagnetic functionality, some recent developments in realizing broadband electromagnetic response by dispersion compensation, nonresonant effects, and several trade-off approaches are reviewed, followed by some perspectives for the future development of broadband metamaterials.

Osteodensitometry imaging techniques are not routinely available in acute operative settings, nor do they provide objective information on local bone properties specifically needed for the prognosis of implant stability.This study sought to verify ex vivo the feasibility and sensitivity of a novel method for the determination of local bone strength in the acute operative setting (intraoperative osseomechanical strength measurement; IOSM) that is based on the principle of material displacement resistance against the force of a rotary indenter. Samples consisted of human femoral heads obtained after total hip replacement. Comparisons were made with results obtained via conventional dual- X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and quantitative computed tomography (qCT).Regression analyses of the results showed a highly significant correlation between the IOSM and the control methods (r = 0.61 and r = 0.56; p < 0.01), indicating that this new approach qualifies as a reliable tool for the intraoperative evaluation of the intrinsic local bone strength.The intraoperative integration of this method may support surgeon on taking proper decisions in terms of optimal surgical approaches and prevention of complications inherent to osteoporotic bone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696310>Monitoring long-term spatial and temporal trends of the infaunal community characteristics along the shallow waters of the Mediterranean coast of Israel.</a></h2><p>Sandy sediment and its infauna were annually sampled along the shallow waters of the Israeli coast during the 2005-2016 period, as a part of the Israeli National Environmental Program framework, aiming to detect anthropogenic interference in that province by monitoring changes in the species composition, abundance, and diversity of the infaunal communities and in accompanied abiotic parameters: the levels of total organic carbon and a series of heavy metals and the site-specific grain size distribution. The > 250-μm fraction of the fauna was segregated from the sampled sediment and was identified to species or higher taxonomic level. Three spatial biotopes were determined based on their unique faunal composition, Haifa Bay, Haifa harbor, and the southern coast. Species homogeneity among samples of each biotope was evaluated. Temporal and spatial changes of the species composition, abundance, and diversity were calculated for each biotope, mostly revealing random annual fluctuations. Only two minor temporal trends were observed: two spatially identical and temporally different faunal communities in the southern coast biotope, distinguishing the 2005-2007 and 2008-2016 periods, and a slight increase in the number of species across time in the two Haifa Bay provinces. Total organic carbon was highly correlated to the faunal composition with the highest organic carbon levels in the Haifa harbor biotope. The biotopes' mutually occurring abundant species were sufficient to determine biotope borders and the contribution of intermittently sampled rare species, including the zoogeographically Indo-Pacific originated ones was feeble, important only to identify species migration and faunistics. Practically, three sampling sites along the Israeli shallow soft substrate, corresponding to the defined spatial biotopes, are sufficient to monitor the effect of environmental changes. Seasonal sampling twice a year is recommended as well as more accurate species identification using molecular taxonomy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694275>Education and Protein Supplementation Improve Nutritional Biomarkers among Hypoalbuminemic Peritoneal Dialysis Patients: A Quasi-Experimental Design.</a></h2><p>Protein- wasting is prevalent in peritoneal dialysis patients, which causes a heavy burden for individuals and healthcare systems. We aimed to investigate the effect of nutritional education, and/or protein supplementation on nutritional biomarkers in hypoalbuminemic peritoneal dialysis patients. A quasi-experimental study was conducted in two dialysis centers at Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital and Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital. Patients were allocated in three groups including control ( = 12), milk protein ( = 21) and soy protein ( = 20). All patients received dietary guidelines from dietitians and completed 3-day dietary records during monthly visits for consecutive three months. Nutrients were analyzed using Nutritionist Professional software. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, albumin, total protein, hemoglobin, serum calcium, phosphorus, sodium, and potassium were assessed monthly. Total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured every three months. After three-month intervention, protein intake (percent of total calories), and serum albumin were significantly increased in three groups. Protein, phosphorus intake, and BUN were increased in two intervention groups. Total serum protein increased in control and milk protein groups, and creatinine increased the control group. Serum phosphorus was not significantly changed.

AL was defined as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV)/forced vital capacity (FVC) of <0.7. Reversibility tests were not performed in this study. The criteria used for the AL staging were developed according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (GOLD) guidelines. The subjects were divided into the following three groups: a control group (normal pulmonary function), GOLD Stage I group (mild AL), and GOLD Stage II-IV group (moderate-to-very severe AL). BMD was classified based on the young adult mean (YAM) as normal (88.6% ≦ YAM [-1 SD ≦]), osteopenia (70% <YAM <88.6% [<- 1 SD and > -2.5 SD]), or osteoporosis (YAM ≦ 70% [≦ -2.5 SD]). Reduced BMD was defined as osteopenia, osteoporosis, or medication used for osteoporosis. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between AL severity and the reduced BMD.The prevalence of reduced BMD in subjects with moderate-to-severe AL (76.2%) was significantly higher than in those without AL (47.9%) (=0.030). In logistic regression models adjusted for age, body mass index, pack-years, physical activity, and alcohol drinking, the risk of reduced BMD (odds ratio: 3.87; 95% confidence interval: 1.20-12.49; =0.024) was significantly higher in subjects with moderate-to-severe AL than in those with normal pulmonary function.Present results suggest that reduced BMD is associated with AL severity in Japanese men.© 2019 Watanabe et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691906>The influence of biotic and abiotic factors on banded common loon (Gavia immer) reproductive success in a remote, mountainous region of the northeastern United States.</a></h2><p>Habitat degradation resulting from anthropogenic activities can threaten wildlife populations. Even wildlife existing in seemingly pristine areas are at risk of airborne pollutants and urban development. The common loon (Gavia immer), a top-trophic level predator in freshwater aquatic ecosystems, has previously experienced detrimental changes in reproductive success as a result of anthropogenic activities. However, long-term studies and large sample sizes are necessary to ascertain the impacts of various anthropogenic activities on this long-lived species.

From 1998-2017, we banded individual loons, collected blood samples to assess mercury (Hg) exposure of the birds, and monitored their reproductive success. Adult female loon hatching success was negatively associated with the amount of rainfall received in a given year while fledging success was positively associated with the amount of shoreline development. Adult male loon hatching success was positively associated with the amount of shoreline development and fledging success was negatively associated with the number of other loon pairs on a lake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693877>Natural cryoprotectants combinations of l-proline and trehalose for red blood cells cryopreservation.</a></h2><p>Cryopreservation of red blood cells (RBCs) holds great potential benefits for supplying transfusion timely in emergencies. Currently, glycerol is the main cryoprotectant permitted in clinical therapy for RBCs cryopreservation, but its broad application is limited by the toxicity and complex deglycerolization process. Successful cryopreservation of RBCs using more effective materials should be studied to reduce freezing damage, increase biocompatibility, and save processing time. Herein, a simple protocol using natural cryoprotectants combinations of l-proline and trehalose attains a low degree of hemolysis (11.2 ± 2.73%) after thawing compared to glycerol. Furthermore, the morphology of RBCs and the activities of Na/K-ATPase and Ca/Mg-ATPase maintain well. Further mechanism study shows that l-proline plays an important role in decreasing the freezing points and inhibiting the growth of ice crystal by permeating into cells during the freezing process. While trehalose works as an inhibitor of ice growth in the freezing process and ice recrystallization in the thawing process. This simple l-proline & trehalose combinations protocol is a promising method to replace current time-consuming and labor-intensive cryopreservation methods of RBCs.Copyright © 2019.

Compared to the intensively investigated transcriptome and proteome, the metabolic response to heat stress is not sufficiently characterized. Mitochondria have been recognized to play an essential role in heat stress tolerance. Given the compartmentalization of the cell, it is not clear if the heat stress-induced metabolic response occurs in mitochondria or in the cytosol. Therefore, a compartment-specific metabolite analysis was performed to analyze the heat stress-induced metabolic response in mitochondria and the cytoplasm. In this work, the isolated mitochondria and the cytoplasm of yeast cells grown at permissive temperature and cells adapting to heat stress were subjected to mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Over a hundred metabolites could be identified, covering amino acid metabolism,  metabolism, arginine metabolism, purine and pyrimidine metabolism, and others. Highly accumulated citrulline and reduced arginine suggested remodeled arginine metabolism. A stable isotope-labeled experiment was performed to analyze the heat stress-induced metabolic remodeling of the arginine metabolism, identifying activated  ornithine biosynthesis to support arginine and spermidine synthesis. The short-term increased spermidine and trehalose suggest their important roles as heat stress markers. These data provide metabolic clues of heat stress-induced metabolic remodeling, which helps in understanding the heat stress response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693334>Setting Carriers Free, Healing Faulty Interfaces Promotes Delocalization and Transport in Nanocrystal Solids.</a></h2><p>Superlattices of epitaxially connected nanocrystals (NCs) are model systems to study electronic and optical properties of NC arrays. Using elemental analysis and structural analysis by in situ x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and grazing-incidence small-angle scattering (GISAXS), respectively, we show that epitaxial superlattices of PbSe NCs keep their structural integrity up to temperatures of 300 C; an ideal starting point to assess the effect of gentle thermal annealing on the superlattice properties. We find that annealing such superlattices between 75 and 150 C induces a marked redshift of the NC band-edge transition. In fact, the post-annealing band-edge reflects theoretical predictions on the impact of charge carrier delocalization in these epitaxial superlattices. In addition, we observe a pronounced enhancement of the charge carrier mobility and a reduction of the hopping activation  after mild annealing. While the superstructure remains intact at these temperatures, structural defect studies through x-ray diffraction indicate that annealing markedly decreases the density of point defects and edge dislocations. This indicates that the connections between NCs in as-synthesized superlattices still form a major source of grain boundaries and defects, which prevent carrier delocalization over multiple NCs and hamper NC-to-NC transport. Overcoming the limitations imposed by interfacial defects is therefore an essential next step in the development of high-quality optoelectronic devices based on NC solids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695195>Chemotaxis as a navigation strategy to boost range expansion.</a></h2><p>Bacterial chemotaxis, the directed movement of cells along gradients of chemoattractants, is among the best-characterized subjects in molecular biology, but much less is known about its physiological roles. It is commonly seen as a starvation response when nutrients run out, or as an escape response from harmful situations. Here we identify an alternative role of chemotaxis by systematically examining the spatiotemporal dynamics of Escherichia coli in soft agar. Chemotaxis in nutrient-replete conditions promotes the expansion of bacterial populations into unoccupied territories well before nutrients run out in the current environment. Low levels of chemoattractants act as aroma-like cues in this process, establishing the direction and enhancing the speed of population movement along the self-generated attractant gradients. This process of navigated range expansion spreads faster and yields larger population gains than unguided expansion following the canonical Fisher-Kolmogorov dynamics and is therefore a general strategy to promote population growth in spatially extended, nutrient-replete environments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694289>High Electromechanical Deformation Based on Structural Beta-Phase Content and Electrostrictive Properties of Electrospun Poly(vinylidene fluoride- hexafluoropropylene) Nanofibers.</a></h2><p>The poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (P(VDF-HFP)) polymer based on electrostrictive polymers is essential in smart materials applications such as actuators, transducers, microelectromechanical systems, storage memory devices,  harvesting, and biomedical sensors. The key factors for increasing the capability of electrostrictive materials are stronger dielectric properties and an increased electroactive β-phase and crystallinity of the material. In this work, the dielectric properties and microstructural β-phase in the P(VDF-HFP) polymer were improved by electrospinning conditions and thermal compression. The P(VDF-HFP) fibers from the single-step electrospinning process had a self-induced orientation and electrical poling which increased both the electroactive β-crystal phase and the spontaneous dipolar orientation simultaneously. Moreover, the P(VDF-HFP) fibers from the combined electrospinning and thermal compression achieved significantly enhanced dielectric properties and microstructural β-phase. Thermal compression clearly induced interfacial polarization by the accumulation of interfacial surface charges among two β-phase regions in the P(VDF-HFP) fibers. The grain boundaries of nanofibers frequently have high interfacial polarization, as they can trap charges migrating in an applied field. This work showed that the combination of electrospinning and thermal compression for electrostrictive P(VDF-HFP) polymers can potentially offer improved electrostriction behavior based on the dielectric permittivity and interfacial surface charge distributions for application in actuator devices, textile sensors, and nanogenerators.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693243>13.7% Efficiency Small-Molecule Solar Cells Enabled by a Combination of Material and Morphology Optimization.</a></h2><p>Compared with the quick development of polymer solar cells, achieving high-efficiency small-molecule solar cells (SMSCs) remains highly challenging, as they are limited by the lack of matched materials and morphology control to a great extent. Herein, two small molecules, BSFTR and Y6, which possess broad as well as matched absorption and  levels, are applied in SMSCs. Morphology optimization with sequential solvent vapor and thermal annealing makes their blend films show proper crystallinity, balanced and high mobilities, and favorable phase separation, which is conducive for exciton dissociation, charge transport, and extraction.

Insects overcome periods of food depletion using diapause-associated physiological mechanisms, such as increased  resources in fat bodies and suppression of metabolism. Because autophagy supplies  resources through the degradation of intracellular components, we hypothesized that it might be an additional strategy to combat starvation during overwintering. In this study, we measured the abundance of the proteins involved in the signaling pathway of autophagy during overwintering in adults of the bean bug Riptortus pedestris (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Alydidae), which must withstand the periodic depletion of its host plants from late fall to early spring. Although the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) markedly increased after the cessation of food supply, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and target of rapamycin (TOR) were not found to be associated with food depletion. Thus, food depletion appears to induce autophagy independent of AMPK and TOR. The GABARAP levels significantly increased universally when the food supply ceased, irrespective of the diapause status of adults and low-temperature conditions. In overwintering diapause adults under seminatural conditions, the GABARAP levels significantly increased during early spring. Thus, autophagy appears to assist the survival of the bean bugs under natural conditions of food deficiency.© The Author(s) 2019.

Today in operating rooms around the world, ultrasonic  is used for tissue manipulation, dissection, cutting, and coagulation. Surgeons including but not limited to the specialties of gynecology, general surgery, colorectal, thoracic, breast, and bariatric have activated ultrasonic  in thousands of patients. As a mainstay surgical  device, patients have benefited from the ultrasonic versatility of its cutting and coagulating effects. The ability of ultrasonic  to be used near vital organs with precision by adjusting for tissue tension, power settings, and activation time has accounted for its safety and clinical outcomes. This overview of the mechanics of ultrasonic  and the evolution of the HARMONIC® (UltraCision, Providence, Rhode Island, now owned by Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio) surgical tools since 1988 provides readers an understanding of this  platform and its distinct advantages. Clinical implications of key research and clinical studies are explored and discussed with a focus on patient and surgical outcomes. Research in a variety of fields and tissues is presented with a special emphasis on the gynecological patient.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691722>Prominent autistic traits and subthreshold bipolar/mixed features of depression in severe anorexia nervosa.</a></h2><p>Autistic traits are associated with a burdensome clinical presentation of anorexia nervosa (AN), as is AN with concurrent depression. The aim of the present study was to explore the intertwined association between complex psychopathology combining autistic traits, subthreshold bipolarity, and mixed depression among people with AN.Sixty patients with AN and concurrent major depressive episode (mean age, 22.2±7 years) were cross-sectionally assessed using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient test (AQ-test), the Hamilton depression scales for depression and anxiety, the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), the Hypomania-Checklist-32 (HCL-32), second revision (for subthreshold bipolarity), the Brown Assessment and Beliefs Scale (BABS), the Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating Disorders Scale (YBC-EDS), and the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q). Cases were split into two groups depending on body mass index (BMI): severe AN (AN+) if BMI < 16, not severe (AN-) if BMI ≥ 16.The "subthreshold bipolarity with prominent autistic traits" pattern correctly classified 83.6% of AN patients (AN+ = 78.1%; AN- = 91.3%, Exp(B) = 1.391). AN+ cases showed higher rates of positive scores for YMRS items 2 (increased motor activity-) and 5 (irritability) compared to AN- cases.In our sample, depressed patients with severe AN had more pronounced autistic traits and subtly mixed bipolarity. Further studies with larger samples and prospective follow-up of treatment outcomes are warranted to replicate these findings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693486>GLP-1 signaling is required for improvement of glucose tolerance by osteocalcin.</a></h2><p>Osteocalcin is a bone-derived hormone that in its uncarboxylated form (GluOC) plays an important role in glucose and  metabolism by stimulating insulin secretion and pancreatic β-cell proliferation through its putative receptor GPRC6A. We previously showed that the effect of GluOC on insulin secretion is mediated predominantly by glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) released from intestinal endocrine cells in response to GluOC stimulation. Moreover, oral administration of GluOC was found to reduce the fasting blood glucose level, to improve glucose tolerance, and to increase the fasting serum insulin concentration and β-cell area in the pancreas in wild-type mice. We have now examined the effects of oral GluOC administration for at least 4 weeks in GLP-1 receptor knockout mice. Such administration of GluOC in the mutant mice triggered glucose intolerance, enhanced gluconeogenesis, and promoted both lipid accumulation in the liver as well as adipocyte hypertrophy and inflammation in adipose tissue. Furthermore, inactivation of GLP-1 receptor signaling in association with GluOC administration induced activation of the transcription factor FoxO1 and expression of its transcriptional coactivator PGC1α in the liver, likely accounting for the observed up-regulation of gluconeogenic gene expression. Our results thus indicate that the beneficial metabolic effects of GluOC are dependent on GLP-1 receptor signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692940>Nitrogen and Sulfur Co-Doped Graphene-Like Carbon from Industrial Dye Wastewater for Use as a High-Performance Supercapacitor Electrode.</a></h2><p>Nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene-like carbon (N,S-GLC) is successfully prepared in a one-step hydrothermal reaction of glucose with industrial dye wastewater followed by chemical activation. The nitrogen and sulfur are sourced entirely from the industrial wastewater. The process not only provides an alternative way of treating industry wastewater, but also offers a green route for recovering  from the waste in the form of chemicals. The resultant N,S-GLC shows a good degree of graphitization, a high specific surface area (1734 m g), and moderate heteroatom doping (N: 2.1 at%, S: 0.7 at%). The N,S-GLC electrode displays high specific capacitance of 275 F g at a current density of 0.5 A g with a retention of 65.4% at 20 A g in 6 m KOH. Moreover, the assembled symmetrical supercapacitor cell shows a capacitance of 38 F g at a current density of 0.5 A g, which is equivalent to an  density of 6.4 Wh kg at a power density of 275.0 W kg. This approach provides an alternative and sustainable way of fabricating heteroatom-doped graphene-like carbon materials for use in high-performance supercapacitors.© 2019 The Authors.

Their combined effect has not been fully understood. Our investigation using a recently developed beam model suggested that periosteal expansion may maintain femur bending stiffness among elderly women, but not help preserve femoral strength and reduce hip fracture risk.Periosteal expansion and bone loss are two accompanying biological phenomena in old population. Their combined effect on bone stiffness, strength, and fracture risk is still not clear, because previous studies have reported contradictory results.A recently developed DXA (dual- X-ray absorptiometry)-based beam model was applied to study the effect at the femoral neck. We first made a theoretical analysis. Then, a clinical cohort consisting of 961 women (316 hip fractures and 645 controls, age of 75.9 ± 7.1) was used to investigate the associations quantitatively. We investigated (1) correlations of femoral-neck width and bone mineral density with femoral stiffness and strength; (2) correlations of femoral stiffness, strength, and hip fracture risk index with age; (3) associations of femoral stiffness, strength and fracture risk index with actual fracture status, measured by the area under the curve (AUC) and odds ratio (OR).The investigation results showed that (i) femoral-neck width had stronger correlation with femoral bending stiffness (r = 0.61-0.82, p < 0.001) than with the other stiffness components, while bone mineral density had stronger correlation with axial/shearing stiffness (r = 0.84-0.97, p < 0.001), strength (r = 0.85-0.92, p < 0.001), and fracture risk index (r = -0.61-0.62, p < 0.001) than with bending stiffness. (ii) The association between femoral bending stiffness and age was insignificant (r = - 0.06-0.05, r > 0.05); The associations of axial/shearing stiffness (r = - 0.27--0.20, p < 0.001), strength (r = - 0.28, p < 0.001), and fracture risk index (r = 0.38, p < 0.001) with age were significant. (iii) Fracture risk index had the strongest association with actual fracture status (AUC = 0.75, OR = 3.19), followed by strength (AUC = 0.74, OR = 2.84) and axial/shearing stiffness (AUC = 0.56-0.65, OR = 2.39-2.49). Femoral bending stiffness had the weakest association (AUC = 0.48-0.69, OR = 1.42-2.09).We concluded that periosteal expansion may be adequate to maintain femoral bending stiffness among elderly women, but it may not help preserve strength and reduce hip fracture risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696272>Underestimated fracture risk in postmenopausal women-application of the hybrid intervention threshold.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated the fragility fracture risk of Taiwanese postmenopausal women with osteopenia. With the incorporation of FRAX and hybrid intervention threshold (HIT), 25% of the participants had high fracture risk. We suggest intervention for fragility fracture for postmenopausal women should be guided by FRAX and HIT instead of bone mineral density alone.To explore the risk of fragility fracture in Taiwanese postmenopausal women with osteopenia using the hybrid intervention threshold (HIT) and Fracture Risk Assessment tool (FRAX).The Taiwan Osteoporosis Association (TOA) conducted a nationwide bone mineral density (BMD) survey between 2008 and 2011 using a bus equipped with a dual- X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) machine. All participants completed a structured questionnaire, which included the elements in the FRAX. Based on the results, the group made up of postmenopausal women with osteopenia was identified. In order to explore the risk of fragility fracture by HIT and FRAX among Taiwan postmenopausal women with osteopenia, the 10-year probability of fracture (FRAX score) and individual intervention threshold (IIT) in this group were calculated. If the FRAX score of a participant was higher than or equal to the IIT or fixed intervention threshold (FIT), the participant was considered as above the HIT (HIT could be reached by being over a threshold at either major osteoporotic fracture or hip fracture) and categorized as having a high FRAX fracture risk.A total of 13,068 postmenopausal women were enrolled in the program. A total of 5743 (43.9%) participants had osteopenia, of which 1434 (25.0%) had high FRAX fracture risk.One quarter of Taiwanese postmenopausal women with osteopenia had high fragility fracture risk evaluated by FRAX and HIT. Due to the poor sensitivity of BMD for fragility fracture, we suggest that intervention for fragility fracture for postmenopausal women should also be guided by FRAX and HIT instead of BMD alone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692982>Potential Substitutes for Replacement of Lead in Perovskite Solar Cells: A Review.</a></h2><p>Lead halide perovskites have displayed the highest solar power conversion efficiencies of 23% but the toxicity issues of these materials need to be addressed. Lead-free perovskites have emerged as viable candidates for potential use as light harvesters to ensure clean and green photovoltaic technology. The substitution of lead by Sn, Ge, Bi, Sb, Cu and other potential candidates have reported efficiencies of up to 9%, but there is still a dire need to enhance their efficiencies and stability within the air. A comprehensive review is given on potential substitutes for lead-free perovskites and their characteristic features like  bandgaps and optical absorption as well as photovoltaic parameters like open-circuit voltage ( ), fill factor, short-circuit current density ( ), and the device architecture for their efficient use. Lead-free perovskites do possess a suitable bandgap but have low efficiency. The use of additives has a significant effect on their efficiency and stability. The incorporation of cations like diethylammonium, phenylethyl ammonium, phenylethyl ammonium iodide, etc., or mixed cations at different compositions at the A-site is reported with engineered bandgaps having significant efficiency and stability.

It has been found that they show different mutation frequencies and spectrums of phenotype induction, however, the characteristics of heavy-ion beams on genetic polymorphism have not been clarified by comparing with γ-rays. In the present study, seeds of  were exposed to carbon-ion beams (with linear  transfer (LET) of 50 keV/μm) and γ-rays (with LET of 0.2 keV/μm) irradiation. By using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, the genetic polymorphism of both M and M plants were investigated, respectively. Carbon-ion beams induced relatively higher polymorphism rate in both M and M generation than γ-rays: the polymorphism rates of M plants derived from carbon-ion beams irradiation are 12.87% (ISSR-C) and 9.01% (RAPD-C), while are 7.67% (ISSR-γ) and 1.45% (RAPD-γ) of plants derived from γ-rays. In M generation, the polymorphism rates of ISSR-C, RAPD-C, ISSR-γ, RAPD-γ are 17.64%, 22.79%, 12.10% and 2.82%, respectively. In summary, the exposure to carbon-ion beams and γ-rays lead to the change of genomic DNA of , which could be tested in M plants and M plants by ISSR and RAPD technology. So, both carbon-ion beams and γ-rays can induce variations of genetic polymorphisms in M plants and M plants. The genetic polymorphisms of M plants and M plants induced by carbon-ion beams are higher than γ-rays, indicating that heavy-ion beams irradiations mutation breeding is more advantageous than conventional ionizing radiations. Average molecular polymorphism of M plants is lower than M mutants, by nearly 4.77% (ISSR-C), 13.78% (RAPD-C), 4.43% (ISSR-γ), 1.37% (RAPD-γ).

The enterotoxigenic  (ETEC) pathotype has been noted as a major cause of diarrheal disease in human and livestock. The aim of this study is to identify broad-spectrum molecular targets in bacteria and broad-spectrum lead compounds (functional inhibitors) with high efficacy and no significant adverse implication on human systems, in relevance to diarrhea therapy through computational approaches which include phylogenetics, target prediction, molecular docking, and molecular flexibility dynamic simulations. Three molecular target genes, , and , which code for uridine diphosphate--acetylglucosamine-1-carboxyvinyltransferase, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase, and deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase III alpha subunit, respectively, were found to be highly conserved in 7 diarrhea-causing microbes. In addition, 21 potential compounds identified showed varied degree of affinity to these enzymes. At free  cutoff of -8.0 kcal/mol, the highest effective molecular target was DNA polymerase III alpha subunit (PDB ID: 4JOM) followed by UDP--acetylglucosamine-1-carboxyvinyltransferase (PDB ID: 5UJS), and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (PDB ID: 1ONN), while the highest effective lead compound was -coeleneterazine followed by amphotericin B, MMV010576, MMV687800, MMV028694, azithromycin, and diphenoxylate. The flexibility dynamics of DNA polymerase III alpha subunit unraveled the atomic fluctuation which potentially implicated Asp593 as unstable active site amino acid residue. In conclusion, bacteria  gene or its protein is a highly promising molecular target for the next generation of antibacterial drugs of the class of -coeleneterazine.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691694>Intense deep-red zero phonon line emission of Mn in double perovskite LaTiO.</a></h2><p>Phosphors that emit in the deep-red spectral region are critical for plant cultivation light-emitting diodes. Herein, ultrabroadband deep-red luminescence of Mn4+ in La4Ti3O12 was studied, which showed intense zero phonon line emission. The double-perovskite structural La4Ti3O12 simultaneously contains two Ti4+ sites forming slightly- and highly-distorted TiO6 octahedra, respectively. The influence of octahedral distortion on the Mn4+ emission  in the two distinct Ti4+ sites was studied both experimentally and theoretically. The spectral measurements indicated that Mn4+ in La4Ti3O12 showed intense zero phonon line emission (ZPL) at deep-red 710-740 nm under excitation of 400 nm charging the O2- → Mn4+ charge transfer transition. The splitting of the ZPL of the Mn4+ 2Eg → 4A2g transition as well as the intensity of ZPL relative to the vibronic phonon sideband emissions were found to be greatly influenced by the degree of octahedral distortion. The crystal-field strength and Racah parameters of Mn4+ in each Ti4+ site were also estimated.

Despite some scientific progress being made on the impact of various nutrition-related changes in physiology and associated interventions at mountaineering altitudes (> 3000 m), the impact of nutrition and/or supplements on further optimization of these hypoxic adaptations at low-moderate altitudes is only an emerging topic. Within this narrative review we have highlighted six major themes involving nutrition: altered  availability, iron, carbohydrate, hydration, antioxidant requirements and various performance supplements. Of these issues, emerging data suggest that particular attention be given to the potential risk for poor  availability and increased iron requirements at the altitudes typical of elite athlete training (~ 1600-2400 m) to interfere with optimal adaptations. Furthermore, the safest way to address the possible increase in oxidative stress associated with altitude exposure is via the consumption of antioxidant-rich foods rather than high-dose antioxidant supplements. Meanwhile, many other important questions regarding nutrition and altitude training remain to be answered. At the elite level of sport where the differences between winning and losing are incredibly small, the strategic use of nutritional interventions to enhance the adaptations to altitude training provides an important consideration in the search for optimal performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694313>Halogenating Enzymes for Active Agent Synthesis: First Steps Are Done and Many Have to Follow.</a></h2><p>Halogens can be very important for active agents as vital parts of their binding mode, on the one hand, but are on the other hand instrumental in the synthesis of most active agents.

Artificial neurons are essentially required to possess functions such as leaky integrate-and-fire and output spike. However, previous reported artificial neurons typically have high operation voltage and large leakage current, leading to significant power consumption, which is contrary to the -efficient biological model. Here, an oscillatory neuron based on Ag filamentary threshold switching memristor (TS) that has a low operation voltage (<0.6 V) with ultralow power consumption (<1.8 µW) is presented. It can trigger neuronal functions, including leaky integrate-and-fire and threshold-driven spiking output, with high endurance (>10 cycles). Being connected to an external resistor or a resistive switching memristor (RS) as synaptic weight, the TS clearly demonstrates self-oscillation behavior once the input pulse voltage exceeds the threshold voltage. Meanwhile, the oscillation frequency is proportional to the input pulse voltage and the conductance of RS synapse, which can be used to integrate the weighted sum current. As an -efficient memristor-based spiking neural network, this combination of TS oscillatory neuron with RS synapse is further evaluated for image recognition achieving an accuracy of 79.2 ± 2.4% for CIFAR-10 subset.© 2019 The Authors.

Endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of oxidative phosphorylation. ROS are formed due to the inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, and lead to oxidative stress that affects mitochondrial metabolism. Chronic oxidative stress contributes to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The immediate consequences of oxidative stress include lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) mutation, which induce neuronal cell death. Mitochondrial binding of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein has been identified as a contributing factor in AD. In PD and HD, respectively, α-synuclein (α-syn) and huntingtin (Htt) gene mutations have been reported to exacerbate the effects of oxidative stress. Similarly, abnormalities in mitochondrial dynamics and the respiratory chain occur in ALS due to dysregulation of mitochondrial complexes II and IV. However, oxidative stress-induced dysfunctions in neurodegenerative diseases can be mitigated by the antioxidant function of hydrogen sulfide (HS), which also acts through the potassium (K/K) ion channel and calcium (Ca) ion channels to increase glutathione (GSH) levels. The pharmacological activity of HS is exerted by both inorganic and organic compounds. GSH, glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) neutralize HO-induced oxidative damage in mitochondria. The main purpose of this review is to discuss specific causes and effects of mitochondrial oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases, and how these are impacted by the antioxidant functions of HS to support the development of advancements in neurodegenerative disease treatment.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692950>Date Pit Carbon Dots Induce Acidic Inhibition of Peroxidase and Disrupt DNA Repair in Antibacteria Resistance.</a></h2><p>Carbon nanodots (C-dots) are emerging as a new type of promising agent in anticancer, imaging, and new .

It is a single step and offers several advantages such as time reducing, cost-effective and environmental non-toxic. Silver nanoparticles are a type of Noble metal nanoparticles and it has tremendous applications in the field of diagnostics, therapeutics, antimicrobial activity, anticancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In the present work, the aqueous extracts of aerial parts of Lampranthus coccineus and Malephora lutea F. Aizoaceae were successfully used for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. The formation of silver nanoparticles was early detected by a color change from pale yellow to reddish-brown color and was further confirmed by transmission electron microscope (TEM), UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and -dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDX). The TEM analysis of showed spherical nanoparticles with a mean size between 12.86 nm and 28.19 nm and the UV- visible spectroscopy showed λmax of 417 nm, which confirms the presence of nanoparticles. The neuroprotective potential of SNPs was evaluated by assessing the antioxidant and cholinesterase inhibitory activity.

Current evidence demonstrated that this canonical mechanism is evolutionary conserved. Thus, recent data demonstrated that inhibition of AMPKα2 in fish hypothalamus led to decreased food intake and liver capacity to use and synthesize glucose, lipid, and amino acid. We hypothesize that a signal of abundance of nutrients from the hypothalamus controls hepatic metabolism. The vagus nerve is the most important link between the brain and the liver. We therefore examined in the present study whether surgical transection of the vagus nerve in rainbow trout is sufficient to alter the effect in liver of central inhibition of AMPKα2. Thus, we vagotomized (VGX) or not (SHAM) rainbow trouts, and then intracerebroventricularly administered adenoviral vectors tagged with GFP alone or linked to a dominant negative isoform of AMPKα2 (AMPKα2-DN). The inhibition of AMPKα2 led to a reduced food intake in parallel with changes in the mRNA abundance of hypothalamic neuropeptides () involved in food intake regulation. Central inhibition of AMPKα2 resulted in liver in decreased capacity of use and synthesis of glucose, lipid, and amino acid. Notably, these effects mostly disappeared in VGX fish. These results support that the autonomic nervous system actions mediates the actions of hypothalamic AMPKα2 on liver metabolism.

In this work, three pumelo cultivars cvs "Hongroumiyou" (HR), "Bairoumiyou" (BR), and "Huangroumiyou" (HuR) were stored at 25 °C for 90 days, and juice sacs were sampled to explore the lignin accumulation and its relationship to sucrose and  depletion were investigated. The results displayed that HuR contained lower sucrose content, lower ATP level, but higher lignin content compared to BR and HR during postharvest storage, indicating that the sequence according to storage resistance on the basis of lignin content is as follows: HuR < BR < HR. Furthermore, sucrose degradation attributed to enhanced activities of neutral invertase (NI), soluble acid invertase (S-AI), cell wall-bound invertase (B-AI), and  deficit on account of declined ATP level, showed significantly negative correlation with lignin accumulation, suggesting that lignin accumulation occurrence could induce sucrose degradation and  deficit during postharvest storage. Additionally, higher activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POD) could accelerate lignin synthesis and resulted in lignin accumulation during postharvest pumelo storage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696103>Investigation of the Environmental Stability of Poly(vinyl alcohol)-KOH Polymer Electrolytes for Flexible Zinc-Air Batteries.</a></h2><p>Next-generation wearable and portable electronic devices require the development of flexible -storage devices with high  density and low cost. Over the past few decades, flexible zinc-air batteries (FZABs), characterized by their extremely high theoretical  density from consuming oxygen in air and low cost, have been regarded as one of the most promising power supplies. However, their unique half-open structure poses great challenges for the environmental stability of their components, including the electrolyte and electrodes. As an important ionic conductor, the poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-KOH gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) has been widely utilized in FZABs. To date, most studies have focused on investigations of the electrode, electrocatalyst materials and battery configuration, while very few have paid attention to the influence of the environment on the electrolyte and the corresponding FZAB performance. Herein, for the first time, the environmental stability of PVA-KOH GPE, such as dimensional stability and water and ionic conductivity retention capability, for FZABs in ambient air has been thoroughly studied. Moreover, the properties of the assembled FZABs in terms of cycling stability, discharge performance and power output are investigated. This report aims to play a leading role in examining the environmental stability of electrolytes in FZABs, which is critical for their practical applications.Copyright © 2019 Fan, Liu, Ding, Deng, Han, Hu and Zhong.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693047>Cavitation, crazing and bond scission in chemically cross-linked polymer nanocomposites.</a></h2><p>It is very important to understand the molecular mechanism of the fracture behavior of chemically cross-linked polymer nanocomposites (PNCs). Thus, in this work, by employing a coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation we investigated the effect of the cross-link density and the cross-link distribution on it by calculating the void formation and the chemical bond scission. Considering the fracture , the optimal fracture properties of PNCs are realized at the moderate cross-link density which results from the competition between the chain slippage induced voids and the bond scission induced voids. Meanwhile, more bond scission occurs on the chain backbone while a high broken percentage of the cross-link bonds appears between chains because of the higher average stress borne by one cross-linked bead than by one other bead. In addition, the number of voids is quantified which first increases and then decreases with the strain at low cross-link density. However, the number of newly formed voids increases again at high cross-link density. Finally, it decreases because of the low rate of bond scission. Furthermore, the chemical bonds are broken at a similar strain for the uniform cross-link distribution while they are broken at any strain for the nonuniform cross-link distribution. The low number of broken bonds induces the disappearance of the second peak of the number of voids with the strain for the nonuniform cross-link distribution. In summary, this work could provide a clear understanding of the fracture mechanism of the chemically cross-linked PNCs on the molecular level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694884>Adipose tissue NAD biosynthesis is required for regulating adaptive thermogenesis and whole-body  homeostasis in mice.</a></h2><p>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a critical coenzyme for cellular  metabolism. The aim of the present study was to determine the importance of brown and white adipose tissue (BAT and WAT) NAD metabolism in regulating whole-body thermogenesis and  metabolism. Accordingly, we generated and analyzed adipocyte-specific nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase () knockout (ANKO) and brown adipocyte-specific  knockout (BANKO) mice because NAMPT is the rate-limiting NAD biosynthetic enzyme. We found ANKO mice, which lack NAMPT in both BAT and WAT, had impaired gene programs involved in thermogenesis and mitochondrial function in BAT and a blunted thermogenic (rectal temperature, BAT temperature, and whole-body oxygen consumption) response to acute cold exposure, prolonged fasting, and administration of β-adrenergic agonists (norepinephrine and CL-316243). In addition, the absence of NAMPT in WAT markedly reduced adrenergic-mediated lipolytic activity, likely through inactivation of the NAD-SIRT1-caveolin-1 axis, which limits an important fuel source fatty acid for BAT thermogenesis. These metabolic abnormalities were rescued by treatment with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which bypasses the block in NAD synthesis induced by NAMPT deficiency. Although BANKO mice, which lack NAMPT in BAT only, had BAT cellular alterations similar to the ANKO mice, BANKO mice had normal thermogenic and lipolytic responses. We also found  expression in supraclavicular adipose tissue (where human BAT is localized) obtained from human subjects increased during cold exposure, suggesting our finding in rodents could apply to people. These results demonstrate that adipose NAMPT-mediated NAD biosynthesis is essential for regulating adaptive thermogenesis, lipolysis, and whole-body  metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693325>Pulsed Electron Avalanche Knife (PEAK) PlasmaBlade versus Traditional Electrocautery for Surgery: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness [Internet].</a></h2><p>Electrosurgical instruments are some of the most often used tools at the surgeon’s disposal. Benefits thought to be associated with these devices range from decreased post-operative pain and intraoperative bleeding, increased surgical speed, and reduced risk of post-surgical hemorrhage. Traditional electrocautery (EC) applies radiofrequency (RF) alternating current to generate high current density at the cutting blade tip and tissue interface resulting in extreme resistive heating of local tissue. that provides effective cutting and coagulation due to instantaneous boiling of fluid and tissue vaporization. The device operates at temperatures of between 300C–350C and the generated heat provides effective cutting and coagulation due to instantaneous boiling of fluid and tissue vaporization. It has been reported that the high temperature of the EC procedure is associated with some drawbacks, such as significant thermal damage to incised tissues, reduced surgical precision compared with a scalpel, potential injury to adjacent structures, and delayed wound healing. The cauterized surface area also increases subsequent inflammation and fluid sequestration into newly created tissue planes, resulting in seroma formation and increased risk of post-operative complications, such as infection. Pulsed-electron avalanche knife (PEAK) PlasmaBlade is a relatively new electrosurgical technology developed to minimize the collateral tissue damage caused by higher-heat instruments such as EC. It uses high-intensity RF pulses to create electrical plasma along the edge of a thin, flat, insulated electrode. The PEAK PlasmaBlade (PPB) system uses a lower amount of  translating into operating temperatures of about 40–140 °C, with a corresponding reduction in heat transfer and reduction in depth of thermal damage to adjacent tissues of approximately 50–90%. The PPB devices are available in several models designed for specific applications and are intended for tissue cutting and coagulation during general surgery. The objective of this report is to summarize the evidence regarding the comparative clinical effectiveness of PPB soft tissue dissection devices versus traditional EC for surgery and the cost-effectiveness of PPB use for surgery.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694339>Heartbeat Sound Signal Classification Using Deep Learning.</a></h2><p>Presently, most deaths are caused by heart disease.

The NLRP inflammasomes have been shown to be expressed in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) and human dermal fibroblasts (HDF). NLRP inflammasomes in keratinocytes are interesting as these skin cells are the first living cells in the skin to contact external exogenous threats such as UV , chemicals, physical trauma, and bacteria and viruses. Activation of the NLRP Inflammasomes by exogenous threats results in the release of active Caspase-1 (ACasp-1), a key protease enzyme, which targets inactive forms of IL-1β, IL-18 as well as IL-1α and IL-33.This article discusses efforts to examine the release of active Caspase-1 from NHEKs activated by various exogenous threats including UVB , ATP, Nigericin and Urban Dust. The work further examines if, after inflammasome activation and Caspase-1 release, certain naturally derived botanical ingredients known to have anti-inflammatory effects can function to inhibit upregulation of active Caspase-1.NHEK were treated with various doses of UVB, ATP and Nigericin and with a single dose of Urban Dust. ACasp-1 expression was measured after 3 and 20 hours using the Promega Caspase Glo-1 bioluminescent assay. After confirmation that 60 mJ/cm of UVB and 5mM of ATP were effective to activate NHEK ACasp-1 release after 20 hrs, these conditions were employed to examine the influence of three botanical blends of ingredients on their ability to inhibit ACasp-1 expression.Initial results demonstrate that NHEKs can be activated to release active Caspase-1 by ATP and UVB, but not by Nigericin or Urban Dust. In addition, it was unexpectedly found that, while ATP and UVB activated NHEKs, the release of ACasp-1-did not happen within the first 3 hours after exposure but did become significant after 20 hours. Additional results indicate that a blend of polysaccharides and two blends of antioxidants, one oil-soluble and the other water-soluble, known for their anti-inflammatory effects, can reduce expression of active Caspase-1 in activated NHEKs when applied extracellularly.Expression of NLRP activated release of ACasp-1 was found to be influenced by UVB and ATP but not by Nigericin or Urban Dust. The effects were also time dependent. Several botanical extract blends were found to reduce ACasp-1 expression in previously activated NHEKs. Links between these inflammatory effects and processes of cellular inflammaging are discussed.© 2019 Gruber and Holtz.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691692>A comprehensive study of the red persistent luminescence mechanism of YOS:Eu,Ti,Mg.</a></h2><p>Y2O2S:Eu,Ti,Mg, a persistent luminescence (PersL) material that exhibits eye-sensitive red emission for longer than 4-5 h, has attracted much attention and has been intensively researched over the past decade. If it is figured out how to prolong its decay time for longer than 8 h, the amazing candle-like red PersL performance, once lit, can illuminate a room all night without electricity. However, the PersL mechanism is still confusing, since different investigators have their own unique understanding about it based on their personal experimental observations. In this work, a more comprehensive and detailed investigation of the PersL mechanism is carried out, based on the defect levels induced by Eu, Ti, and Mg impurities and anion vacancies, using first-principles calculations. Our calculated results suggest that the empty spin-down 4f levels of Eu3+ appear in the band gap, while the occupied spin-up 4f levels are just below the valence band maximum (VBM). The 3d levels of Ti4+ are located in the band gap, with the highest levels around 1.4 eV below the conduction band minimum (CBM). Positively charged anion vacancies were found to induce empty defect levels just below the CBM and so could serve as electron trap centers, which prolong the lifetimes of excited electrons and lead to the PersL of the Ti4+ ion. When Eu3+ is co-doped with Ti4+, the  of the excited Ti4+ ions is transferred to Eu3+. This mechanism can explain well most of the experimental observations that have appeared in the literature over the past decade. The obtained PersL mechanism is very clear in terms of the roles played by most types of defect, so we hope it can provide physical understanding and create intrigue around the idea of practical guidelines for the design of new red PersL materials in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694517>Enhanced Platelet Sensitivity to IGF-1 in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus is characterized by increased platelet activation which is determined by many factors including changes in the expression of membrane proteins. The aim of this study was to investigate the sensitivity of human platelets to the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). Ligand binding was analyzed using I-labelled IGF-1 and insulin, and relative expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and insulin receptor (IR) was evaluated by Western blotting. Platelet aggregation in the presence of IGF-1 was studied by the plate aggregometry assay. We found that platelets from DM2 patients exhibited significantly higher IGF-1 binding and upregulation of IGF-1R expression in comparison with healthy individuals. Both insulin binding and IR expression were lower in the DM2 group, but the differences with the healthy control were statistically insignificant. The potentiating effect of IGF-1 on the thrombin-induced activation of platelets was detected in both groups but was significantly more pronounced in the DM2 patients. The initial rate of platelet activation in the presence of IGF-1 positively correlated with the concentration of glycated hemoglobin. Platelets isolated from DM2 patients displayed elevated expression of the IGF-1R subunits, which might have contributed to the higher sensitivity of these cells to IGF-1 in thrombin-initiated aggregation by increasing the rate of platelet activation. However, further experiments are needed to investigate the role of IGF-1 in thrombotic complications that usually accompany diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694271>Proposing a New Method Based on Image Analysis to Estimate the Segregation Index of Lightweight Aggregate Concretes.</a></h2><p>This work presents five different methods for quantifying the segregation phenomenon in lightweight aggregate concretes (LWAC). The use of LWACs allows greater design flexibility and substantial cost savings, and has a positive impact on the  consumption of a building. However, these materials are susceptible to aggregate segregation, which causes an irregular distribution of the lightweight aggregates in the mixture and may affect the concrete properties. To quantify this critical process, a new method based on image analysis is proposed and its results are compared to the well-established methods of density and ultrasonic pulse velocity measurement. The results show that the ultrasonic test method presents a lower accuracy than the other studied methods, although it is a nondestructive test, easy to perform, and does not need material characterization. The new methodology via image analysis has a strong correlation with the other methods, it considers information from the complete section of the samples, and it does not need the horizontal cut of the specimens or material characterization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693293>Selective Microwave-assisted Pyrolysis of Cellulose towards Levoglucosenone using Clay Catalysts.</a></h2><p>Levoglucosenone (anhydrosugar) is one of the most promising chemical platforms derived from the pyrolysis of biomass. It is a chiral building block for pharmaceuticals as well as an intermediate in the production of solvents and polymers. Therefore, the development of cost-efficient, low- production methods are vital for a future sustainable biorefinery. Here we report a novel, green approach to the production of levoglucosenone using a microwave (MW) assisted pyrolysis of cellulose in the presence of readily available clays. We showed that natural and pillared clays in the presence of MW irradiation significantly increase the yield of levoglucosenone from cellulose. Both the water content and the presence of acid centers are critical characteristics which influence the yield and distribution of catalyzed products. A unique experiment was designed using a synergetic effect between different types of catalysts which enhanced the levoglucosenone yield to 12.3wt% with 63% purity.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Amaranthus blitum leaves exhibited the highest content of Magnesium (9.5 mg/g) and Potassium (36.5 mg/g) respectively. This study demonstrated that based on weight and bioavailabilty, 10 g of Cucurbita moschata (dried weight) provides between 57% to 136% daily value of iron for children age between 7 and 10 years old and can provide up to 41%, 81% and 27% daily value of iron for female aged 18+, lactating females aged 18+ and males aged 18+ respectively. A 10 g portion of Urticadioica leaves (dried weight) will provide 75% or 58% of the daily value of calcium based on the North American or western European recommendation respectively while the same amount of Amaranthus leaves provides between 37% to 50 % of daily value of magnesium for adults of nineteen years and older based on their weight. The daily value of zinc despite its dependency with age, weight and Zinc bioavailability can be supplied by 10 g of Manihot esculenta leaves (dried weight) at a percentage ranged from 8% to 39%.

Characterizing its variability in space and time is critical to increase our capability to forecast extreme weather events, manage water resources, and optimize agricultural practices. Global estimates of surface soil moisture are provided by satellite sensors, but at coarse spatial resolutions. Here, we show that the resolution of satellite soil moisture products can be increased to scales representative of ground measurements by reproducing the scale invariance properties of soil moisture derived from hydrologic simulations at hyperresolutions of less than 100 m. Specifically, we find that surface soil moisture is scale invariant over regimes extending from a satellite footprint to 100 m. We use this evidence to calibrate a statistical downscaling algorithm that reproduces the scale invariance properties of soil moisture and test the approach against 1-km aircraft remote sensing products and through comparisons of downscaled satellite products to ground observations. We demonstrate that hyperresolution hydrologic models can close the loop of satellite soil moisture downscaling for local applications such as agricultural irrigation, flood event prediction, and drought and fire management.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692459>X-ray interference fringes from a weakly bent plane-parallel crystal with negative strain gradient.</a></h2><p>Under the anomalous transmission condition in the Bragg mode, X-ray interference fringes were observed between two beams with different hyperbolic trajectories in a very weakly bent plane-parallel perfect crystal with negative strain gradient. The origin of the fringes was analysed based on the dynamical theory of diffraction for a distorted crystal. In the reflected beam from the entrance surface, the interference fringes were observed between once- and twice-reflected beams from the back surface. In the transmitted beam from the back surface, the interference fringes were observed between the direct beam and once-reflected beam from the entrance surface. In the emitted beam from the lateral surface, the interference fringes were observed between the beams after different numbers of reflections in the crystal.

In this work, ternary hybrid electrodes composed of conducting graphene/reduced graphene oxide (rGO), which store charge mainly through electric double-layer mechanisms, covered by NiO nanostructures, for adding pseudocapacitance, were fabricated through a matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation technique. The incorporation of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) provokes an increase of the porosity and thus, a substantial enhancement of the electrodes' capacitance (from 4 to 20 F cm-3 at 10 mV s-1). Volumetric capacitances of 34 F cm-3 were also obtained with electrodes containing just carbon nanotubes coated with NiO nanostructures. Moreover, the use of nitrogen containing precursors (ammonia, urea) for laser-induced N-doping of the nanocarbons also provokes a notable increase of the capacitance. Remarkably, N-containing groups in rGO-MWCNTs mainly add electric double layer charge storage, pointing to an increase of electrode porosity, whereas redox reactions contribute with a minor diffusion fraction. It was also observed that the loading of carbon nanotubes leads to an increase of diffusion-controlled charge storage mechanisms versus capacitive ones in rGO-based electrodes, the opposite effect being observed in graphene electrodes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693380>Protein adsorption at the air-water interface by a charge sensing interferometric technique.</a></h2><p>Protein uptake at the interface of a millimeter-sized air bubble in water, is investigated by a recently developed differential interferometric technique. The technique allows the study of capillary waves with amplitudes in the range of 10-9 m, excited at the surface of the bubble by an electric field of intensity in the order of 10 V/cm. By studying the resonant modes of the bubble (radial and shape modes) it is possible to assess variations of interfacial properties and, in particular, of the net surface charge as a function of bulk protein concentration. Sensing the interfacial charge, the technique enables us to follow the absorption process in condition of low concentrations, not easily assessable by other methods. We focus on bovine serum albumin (BSA) and Lysozyme, as representatives of typical globular proteins. To provide a comprehensive insight into the novelty of the technique we also investigated the equilibrium adsorption of SDS ionic surfactant for bulk concentrations hundreds times lower than the CMC. Results unveil how the absorption of charged molecules affects the amplitudes of the bubble resonant modes even before affecting the frequencies in a transition-like fashion. Different adsorption models are proposed and developed. They are validated against the experimental findings by comparing frequency and amplitude data. By measuring the charging rate of the bubble interface, we have followed the absorption kinetics of BSA and Lysozyme recognizing a slow,  barrier limited, phenomena, with characteristic times in agreement with data in the literature. The evaluation of the surface excess concentration () of BSA and SDS at equilibrium is obtained by monitoring charge uptake.

Modified beam models (MBM) for which the OFs of small fields (down to 1 × 1 cm) were increased by up to 12% compared to the original beam models (OBM) were created for two TPSs. These beam models were used to recalculate treatment plans of different complexity. Treatment plans using stereotactic 3D-conformal (s3D-CRT) for brain metastasis as well as VMAT plans for head and neck and prostate cancer patients were generated. Dose distributions calculated with the MBM and the OBM were compared to measured dose distributions acquired using film dosimetry and a 2D-detector-array. For the s3D-CRT plans the calculated and measured dose at the isocenter was evaluated. For VMAT, gamma pass rates (GPRs) were calculated using global gamma index with 3%/3 mm, 2%/3 mm, 1%/3 mm and 2%/2 mm with a 20% threshold. Contribution of small fields to the total fluence was expressed as the ratio (F) of fluence trough leaf openings smaller than 2 cm to the total fluence. Using film dosimetry for the s3D-CRT plans, the average of the ratio of calculated dose to measured dose at the isocenter was 1.01 and 1.06 for the OBM and MBM model, respectively. A significantly lower GPR of the MBM compared to the OBM was only found for the localized prostate cases ( = 12.4%) measured with the 2D-detector-array and an acceptance criterion of 1%/3 mm. The effects of uncertainties in small field OFs implemented in TPSs are most pronounced for s3D-CRT cases and can be clearly identified using patient specific quality assurance. For VMAT these effects mainly remain undetected using standard patient specific quality assurance. Using tighter acceptance criteria combined with an analysis of the fluence generated by small fields can help identifying inaccuracies of OFs implemented in TPSs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696207>Amelioration of heavy metal stress by endophytic Bacillusamyloliquefaciens RWL-1 in rice by regulating metabolic changes: potential for bacterial bioremediation.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate the bioremediation efficiency of phytohormone-producing endophytic Bacillus amyloliquefaciens RWL-1 isolated from rice seeds. In this study, we tested RWL-1 against various heavy metals (Cu, Cr, Pb, and Cd). Among the tested heavy metals, RWL-1 showed highest tolerance for Cu stress and we observed alterations in growth kinetics with various Cu concentrations (1, 2.5, and 5 mM). We confirmed the biosorption potential of RWL-1 by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with -dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) showing that Cu ions were adsorbed on RWL-1 cell surfaces. We further tested RWL-1 for its plant growth promoting and stress reliance efficiency in response to a dose-dependent increase in soil Cu (1, 2.5, and 5 mM). The RWL-1 inoculation significantly increased seedling biomass and growth attributes compared with non-inoculated control seedlings without Cu stress. Moreover, RWL-1 inoculation significantly promoted a physiochemical response in seedlings with and without Cu stress by reducing Cu uptake, improving carbohydrate levels (glucose, sucrose, fructose, and raffinose), enhancing amino acids regulation, and augmenting antioxidant levels (POD, PPO and GHS). Levels of stress responsive phytohormones such as abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA) were significantly reduced in RWL-1-inoculated seedlings as compared with non-inoculated control seedlings under normal condition and same levels of Cu stress. In conclusion, the inoculation of B. amyloliquefaciens RWL-1 can significantly improve plant growth in Cu-contaminated soil and reduce metal accumulation, thus making plants safer for consumption. This approach could be tremendously helpful for safe and sustainable agriculture in heavy metal-contaminated areas.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694377>Fluorescence enhancement of aromatic macrocycles by lowering excited singlet state energies.</a></h2><p>A series of cyclo--phenylene congeners with a variation of interphenylene bridges were synthesized by adopting concise synthetic routes to investigate the structure-fluorescence relationships of macrocycles.

P. aeruginosa eventually predominates as the primary pathogen, though it is unknown why this is the case. Label-free quantitative (LFQ) proteomics was employed to investigate the cellular response of the alveolar epithelial cell line, A549, to co-exposure of A. fumigatus and P. aeruginosa. These studies revealed a significant increase in the rate of P. aeruginosa proliferation where A. fumigatus was present. Shotgun proteomics performed on A549 cells exposed to either A. fumigatus or P. aeruginosa or to A. fumigatus and P. aeruginosa sequentially, revealed distinct changes to the host-cell proteome in response to either or both pathogens. While key signatures of infection were retained amongst all pathogen-exposed groups, including changes in mitochondrial activity and  output, the relative abundance of proteins associated with endocytosis, phagosomes and lysosomes were decreased in sequentially exposed cells compared to cells exposed to either pathogen. Our findings indicate that A. fumigatus render A549 cells unable to internalize bacteria, thus providing an environment in which P. aeruginosa can proliferate. This research provides novel insights into the whole-cell proteomic response of A549 cells to A. fumigatus and P. aeruginosa, and highlights distinct differences in the proteome following sequential exposure to both pathogens, which may explain why P. aeruginosa can predominate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693829>Complete genome and calcium carbonate precipitation of alkaliphilic  sp.

Alkaliphilic and halotolerant  sp. AK13 was isolated from the rhizosphere of . Unlike other tested  species, the AK13 strain grows at pH 13 and withstands 11% (w/v) NaCl. Growth of the AK13 strain at elevated pH without urea promoted calcium carbonate (CaCO) formation. Irregular vaterite-like CaCO minerals that were tightly attached to cells were observed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy. -dispersive X-ray spectrometry, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the presence of CaCO around the cell. Isotope ratio mass spectrometry confirmed that the majority of CO ions in the CaCO were produced by cellular respiration rather than being derived from atmospheric carbon dioxide. The minerals produced from calcium acetate-added growth medium formed smaller crystals than those formed in calcium lactate-added medium. Strain AK13 appears to heal cracks on mortar specimens when applied as a pelletized spore powder. Alkaliphilic  sp.

This approach, which is similar to that used in the rotation method of crystallographic data collection at synchrotrons, propagates error estimates from photon-counting statistics to the merged data. Here, it is demonstrated that the application of this approach to SX data provides better SAD phasing ability, enabling the autobuilding of a protein structure that had previously failed to be built. Estimating the error in the merged reflection intensities requires the understanding and propagation of all of the sources of error arising from the measurements. One type of error, which is well understood, is the counting error introduced when the detector counts X-ray photons. Thus, if other types of random errors (such as readout noise) as well as uncertainties in systematic corrections (such as from X-ray attenuation) are completely understood, they can be propagated along with the counting error, as appropriate. In practice, most software packages propagate as much error as they know how to model and then include error-adjustment terms that scale the error estimates until they explain the variance among the measurements. If this is performed carefully, then during SAD phasing likelihood-based approaches can make optimal use of these error estimates, increasing the chance of a successful structure solution. In serial crystallography, SAD phasing has remained challenging, with the few examples of de novo protein structure solution each requiring many thousands of diffraction patterns. Here, the effects of different methods of treating the error estimates are estimated and it is shown that using a parametric approach that includes terms proportional to the known experimental uncertainty, the reflection intensity and the squared reflection intensity to improve the error estimates can allow SAD phasing even from weak zinc anomalous signal.open access.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692458>Measurement and alleviation of subsurface damage in a thick-crystal neutron interferometer.</a></h2><p>The construction is described of a monolithic thick-crystal perfect silicon neutron interferometer using an ultra-high-precision grinding technique and a combination of annealing and chemical etching that differs from the construction of prior neutron interferometers. The interferometer is the second to have been annealed after machining and the first to be annealed prior to chemical etching. Monitoring the interference signal at each post-fabrication step provides a measurement of subsurface damage and its alleviation.

The strategy is based on the employment of a nanoporous metallic structure as a mechanically stable and conductive scaffold inside of which an active material is directly grown. The porous metallic structures with the pore size on the nanometric scale were obtained by de-alloying microcrystalline Cu60Ag30Al10, applying the method of selective dissolution of the less noble metals from the alloy. The active material of choice is LiMnPO4-olivine, which displays higher  density in comparison with the well-known LiFePO4 (701 W h kg-1 versus 586 W h kg-1). The improved electrode capacity can be explained by the enhanced diffusion of Li+ into LiMnPO4, achieved by decreasing the size of the phospho-olivine particles, incorporated inside the pores of the metallic structure. This approach enables to us perform the precise engineering of the particle size, which in turn contributes to the improvement of the electrochemical properties of phospho-olivines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693785>Blue Light Emitting Defective Nanocrystals Composed of Earth-Abundant Elements.</a></h2><p>Copper-based ternary (I-III-IV) chalcogenide nanocrystals (NCs) are compositionally-flexible semiconductors that do not contain Lead (Pb) or Cadmium (Cd). Cu-In-S NCs are the dominantly studied member of this important materials class and have been reported to contain optically-active defect states. However, there are minimal reports of In-free compositions that exhibit efficient PL. Here, we report a novel solution-phase synthesis of ~4 nm defective nanocrystals (DNCs) composed of Copper, Aluminum, Zinc, and Sulfur with ~20% quantum yield and an attractive PL maximum of 450 nm. Extensive spectroscopic characterization suggests the presence of highly localized electronic states resulting in reasonably fast PL decays (~1 ns), large vibrational  spacing, small Stokes shift, and temperature-independent PL linewidth and PL lifetime (between room temperature and ~5K). Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest PL transitions arise from defects within a CuAl 5 S 8 crystal lattice, which supports the experimental observation of highly-localized states. The results reported here provide a new material with unique optoelectronic characteristics that is an important analog to well-explored Cu-In-S NCs.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The perovskite materials and type of additives play a crucial role in improving the photovoltaic performance and stability. Therefore, here, we demonstrated a simple approach to reduce the grain boundaries and increase the grain size by adding thiourea (TU) as an additive in mixed halide (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, triple cation Cs0.05[(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15]0.95 and quadruple Rb0.05{Cs0.05[(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15]0.95}0.95 cation perovskite absorbers. Our results indicate that the TU-added perovskite thin films have positive effects on the grain size, which improved up to 2.6 μm for the quadruple cation. Final optimization with the quadruple cation containing TU additive-based PVSC exhibited a 20.92% PCE, which is higher than additive-free PVSCs. Furthermore, the stability of the additive-modified PVSCs is much higher than that of bare films due to their ultra-large grain size with reduced grain boundaries. In addition, our thermal stress results exhibited that the additive-based PVSC devices display better thermal stability of more than ∼100 h at 60 °C without encapsulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692328>Nanosized MoSe2@Carbon Matrix: A Stable Host Material for the Highly Reversible Storage of Potassium and Aluminum Ions.</a></h2><p>Owing to their low-cost and abundant reserves relative to conventional lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) and aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) have shown appealing potential for electrochemical  storage, but progress so far has been limited by the lack of suitable electrode materials.

The possibility of conducting hard x-ray photoexcitation and photoionization experiments under state-of-the art conditions in terms of photon and electron kinetic  resolution has become available only in the last few years. HAXPES has then produced structural and dynamical information at the level of detail already reached in the VUV and soft-x-ray ranges. The much improved experimental conditions have allowed extending to the hard x-ray range some methods well established in soft x-ray spectroscopies. Investigations of electron and nuclear dynamics in the femtosecond (fs, 10-15 sec) and even attosecond (as, 10-18 sec) regime have become feasible. Complex relaxation phenomena following deep-core ionization can now be enlightened in great detail. Other phenomena like e.g. recoil-induced effects are much more important in fast photoelectron emission, which can be induced by hard x-rays. Furthermore, a new kind of ionic states with double core holes can be observed by x-ray single-photon absorption.

Here, we report facile synthesis of CuSbS nanoplates and CuSbS-CuSbS nanocomposite using hot injection method with varying sulfur precursors. Elemental sulfur (S) as sulfur precursor results in nanoplates of pure CuSbS, while thioacetamide (TA) as sulfur source gives nanocomposite with CuSbS nanoparticle decorated on the surface of CuSbS nanoplates. The ease of reduction of TA as compared to sulfur at high temperature, in the presence of oleylamine, promotes the oxidation of antimony from (III) to (V) state and the formation of CuSbS phase containing Sb(V). Raman scattering study confirms the presence of CuSbS phase in CuSbS-CuSbS nanocomposite. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy study on CuSbS nanoplates and CuSbS-CuSbS nanocomposite confirms the desired valence state of the constituent elements.

Mean weighted skin temperature was significantly lower in RAIN than in CON during exercise (P<0.05). Oxygen consumption and rating of perceived exertion were significantly higher in RAIN than in CON at 50 and 60 minutes (P<0.05). Plasma lactate was significantly higher in RAIN than in CON at 10 minutes and from 40 to 60 minutes (P<0.05). Plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly higher in RAIN than in CON at 10 minutes and from 40 to 60 minutes (P<0.05).These results suggest that rain increased heat loss during the early phase of exercise in the cold, then heat production increased and transiently suppressed cold stress. However, with time, body heat loss intensified due to increasing wet area, and then  expenditure and plasma lactate increased due to cold stress.

Dietary measurements were collected using a valid and reliable food frequency questionnaire. MetS was defined as the existence of at least 3 risk factors according to the Cook criteria. Diet was assessed based on dietary components of the WHO healthy diet. Dietary patterns were defined by principal component analysis.The mean ± SD age of participants (42% boys and 57% girls) was 13.5 ± 3.7 years. The most consistency with the WHO healthy diet was observed for cholesterol, free sugar and protein consumption in both genders, and the least was for n-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acid, trans-fatty acid and salt. Intake of SFA up to 12% of  intake (third quartile) reduced the risk of MetS, compared to the first quartile. Subjects in the third quartile of n-6 poly-unsaturated fatty acid intake (6.2% of ) showed the lowest odds ratio of MetS compared to the first quartile (OR: 0.18, CI: 0.04-0.66).

The present review gathers recent data demonstrating that orexins may have a therapeutic potential in several pathologies with an immune component including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, narcolepsy, obesity, intestinal bowel diseases, septic shock, and cancers.Copyright © 2019 Couvineau, Voisin, Nicole, Gratio, Abad and Tan.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694214>Highly Transparent and Surface-Plasmon-Enhanced Visible-Photodetector Based on Zinc Oxide Thin-Film Transistors with Heterojunction Structure.</a></h2><p>Highly transparent zinc oxide (ZnO)-based thin-film transistors (TFTs) with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) capable of detecting visible light were fabricated through spray pyrolysis on a fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate. The spray-deposited channel layer of ZnO had a thickness of approximately 15 nm, and the thickness exhibited a linear increase with an increasing number of sprays. Furthermore, the ZnO thin-film exhibited a markedly smoother channel layer with a significantly lower surface roughness of 1.84 nm when the substrate was 20 cm from the spray nozzle compared with when it was 10 cm away. Finally, a ZnO and Au-NP heterojunction nanohybrid structure using plasmonic  detection as an electrical signal, constitutes an ideal combination for a visible-light photodetector. The ZnO-based TFTs convert localized surface plasmon  into an electrical signal, thereby extending the wide band-gap of materials used for photodetectors to achieve visible-light wavelength detection. The photo-transistors demonstrate an elevated on-current with an increase of the AuNP density in the concentration of 1.26, 12.6, and 126 pM and reach values of 3.75, 5.18, and 9.79 × 10 A with applied gate and drain voltages. Moreover, the threshold voltage (Vth) also drifts to negative values as the AuNP density increases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692661>Nanoscale mapping of chemical composition in organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite films.</a></h2><p>Lead-based organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) solar cells can attain efficiencies over 20%. However, the impact of ion mobility and/or organic depletion, structural changes, and segregation under operating conditions urge for decisive and more accurate investigations. Hence, the development of analytical tools for accessing the grain-to-grain OIHP chemistry is of great relevance. Here, we used synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy (nano-FTIR) to map individual nanograins in OIHP films. Our results reveal a spatial heterogeneity of the vibrational activity associated to the nanoscale chemical diversity of isolated grains. It was possible to map the chemistry of individual grains in CsFAMA [CsFAMAPb(IBr)] and FAMA [FAMAPb(IBr)] films, with information on their local composition. Nanograins with stronger nano-FTIR activity in CsFAMA and FAMA films can be assigned to PbI and hexagonal polytype phases, respectively. The analysis herein can be extended to any OIHP films where organic cation depletion/accumulation can be used as a chemical label to study composition.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The maximum lipase production (4.01 IU/mL) was obtained within 4 days of incubation using 0.1% CaCl concentration and 8% wheat bran concentration. Further, salting out technique was applied for partial purification of lipase. The partially purified lipase was immobilized using Au@Ag bimetallic nanoshell. The characterization of immobilized lipase was carried out by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR),  dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). The immobilized lipase could retain its 95% of activity after 15 days of storage at 4 °C. Subsequently, Au@Ag immobilized lipase was used for the degradation of waste cooking oil (WCO), which showed higher WCO degradation (85%) compared to the free lipase mediated waste cooking oil degradation (71%).

Along this line, polymeric binders that can assist in maintaining the mechanical integrity and interfacial stability of SiO electrodes are desired to realize higher contents of SiO . Herein, a pyrene-poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)-polyrotaxane (PR) supramolecular network is reported as a polymeric binder for SiO with 100 wt%. The noncovalent functionalization of a carbon coating layer on the SiO is achieved by using a hydroxylated pyrene derivative via the π-π stacking interaction, which simultaneously enables hydrogen bonding interactions with the PR-PAA network through its hydroxyl moiety. Moreover, the PR's ring sliding while being crosslinked to PAA endows a high elasticity to the entire polymer network, effectively buffering the volume expansion of SiO and largely mitigating the electrode swelling. Based on these extraordinary physicochemical properties of the pyrene-PAA-PR supramolecular binder, the robust cycling of SiO electrodes is demonstrated at commercial levels of areal loading in both half-cell and full-cell configurations.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Mutations of SLC4A11, an abundant corneal solute transporter, cause CHED and some cases of FECD. The link between defective SLC4A11 solute transport function and CEnC loss is, however, unclear. Cell adhesion assays using SLC4A11-transfected HEK293 cells and primary human CEnC revealed that SLC4A11 promotes adhesion to components of Descemet's membrane (DM), the basement membrane layer to which CEnC bind. An antibody against SLC4A11 extracellular loop 3 (EL3) suppressed cell adhesion, identifying EL3 as the DM binding site. Earlier studies showed that some SLC4A11 mutations cause FECD and CHED by impairing solute transport activity or cell surface trafficking. Without affecting these functions, FECD-causing mutations in SLC4A11-EL3 compromised cell adhesion capacity. In an -minimized SLC4A11-EL3 three-dimensional model, these mutations cluster and are buried within EL3 structure. A GST fusion protein of SLC4A11-EL3 interacts with principal DM protein, COL8A2, as identified by mass spectrometry. Engineered SLC4A11-EL3-containing protein, STIC (SLC4A11-EL3 Transmembrane-GPA Integrated Chimera), promotes cell adhesion in transfected HEK293 cells and primary human CEnC, confirming the cell adhesion role of EL3. Taken together, the data suggest that SLC4A11 directly binds DM to serve as a cell adhesion molecule (CAM). These data further suggest that cell adhesion defects contribute to FECD and CHED pathology. Observations with STIC point toward a new therapeutic direction in these diseases: replacement of lost cell adhesion capacity.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

Results showed that COD and ammonia-N (NH-N) were slightly stimulated and remained high and stable with the increase of alkalinity up to 750 mg/L, while denitrification was boosted and total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) removal efficiency increased from 60.46% to 98.62% with an additional alkalinity of 750 mg/L. However, total phosphorus (TP) removal stayed unaffected and efficient. Illumina MiSeq sequencing revealed that microbial diversity and richness shifted mostly with 500 mg/L exterior alkalinity addition. Additional alkalinity altered the bacterial compositions within aerobic granules at various levels and the enrichment of Thiothrix and Acinetobacter was accounted for the promotion of COD and TIN removal.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This makes S1R a potential therapeutic target in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Especially, as a missense mutation E102Q in S1R has been reported in few familial ALS cases. However, the pathogenicity of S1RE102Q and the beneficial impact of S1R in the ALS context remain to be demonstrated in vivo. To address this, we generated transgenic Drosophila that express human wild-type S1R or S1RE102Q. Expression of mutant S1R in fly neurons induces abnormal eye morphology and locomotor defects in a dose-dependent manner. This was accompanied by abnormal mitochondrial fragmentation, reduced ATP levels and a higher fatigability at the neuromuscular junction during high  demand. Overexpressing IP3 receptor or glucose transporter mitigates the S1RE102Q-induced eye phenotype, further highlighting the role of calcium and  metabolism in its toxicity. More importantly, we showed that wild-type S1R rescues locomotor activity and ATP levels of flies expressing the key ALS protein, TDP43. Moreover, overexpressing wild-type S1R enhances resistance of flies to oxidative stress. Therefore, our data provide the first genetic evidence that mutant S1R recapitulates ALS pathology in vivo while increasing S1R confers neuroprotection against TDP43 toxicity.© The Author(s) 2019.

The primary outcomes were the proportion of  and protein daily targets delivered. Secondary outcomes compared the effects on gastrointestinal tolerance, glycaemic control, mortality, mechanical ventilation days, length of stay in intensive care unit and hospital.From a total of 82 patients (rate based feeding = 27, volume based feeding = 55), volume based feeding patients received significantly more prescribed  (52% versus 81%; p < 0.001) and protein (40% versus 74%; p < 0.001).

Drying-off typically comprises dietary changes as well as gradual or abrupt changes in daily milking frequency, which may challenge the welfare of high-yielding cows. This study investigated the isolated and combined effects of different feed  densities (normal lactation diet versus -reduced diet, both offered ad libitum) and daily milking frequencies (twice versus once) on the feeding motivation of dairy cows on two separate days prior to dry-off (i.e. the day of last milking) using a push-gate feeder. During both days, cows on the -reduced diet pushed more than five times more weight to earn the final feed reward and were nearly ten times faster to feed on the first reward than cows on the normal lactation diet. Illustrating the importance of developing more animal welfare-friendly dry-off management, these results illustrate that cows show signs of hunger prior to dry-off when provided a diet with reduced  density, although offered for ad libitum intake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693026>Supermetal: SbF-mediated methane oxidation occurs by C-H activation and isobutane oxidation occurs by hydride transfer.</a></h2><p>SbVF5 is generally assumed to oxidize methane through a methanium-to-methyl cation mechanism. However, experimentally no H2 is observed, and the mechanism of methane oxidation has remained unsolved for several decades. To solve this problem, density functional theory calculations with multiple chemical models (mononuclear and dinuclear) were used to examine methane oxidation by SbVF5 in the presence of CO leading to the methyl acylium cation ([CH3CO]+). While there is a low barrier for methane protonation by [SbVF6]-[H]+ (the combination of SbVF5 and HF) to give the [SbVF5]-[CH5]+ ion pair, H2 dissociation is a relatively high  process, even with CO assistance, and so this protonation pathway is reversible. While Sb-mediated hydride transfer has a reasonable barrier, the C-H activation/σ-bond metathesis mechanism with the formation of an SbV-Me intermediate is lower in . This pathway leads to the acylium cation by functionalization of the SbV-Me intermediate with CO and is consistent with no observation of H2. Because this C-H activation/metal-alkyl functionalization pathway is higher in  than methane protonation, it is also consistent with the experimentally observed methane hydrogen-to-deuterium exchange. This is the first time that evidence is presented demonstrating that SbVF5 acts beyond a Bronsted superacid and involves C-H activation with an organometallic intermediate. In contrast to methane, due to the much lower carbocation hydride affinity, isobutane significantly favors hydride transfer to give the tert-butyl carbocation with concomitant SbV to SbIII reduction. In this mechanism, the resulting highly acidic SbV-H intermediate provides a route to H2 through protonation of isobutane, which is consistent with experiments and resolves the longstanding enigma of different experimental results for methane versus isobutane.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696189>Visible-light-mediated direct C3-arylation of 2H-indazoles enabled by an electron-donor-acceptor complex.</a></h2><p>A mild visible-light-mediated, photocatalyst-free arylation of 2H-indazoles was developed.

HFF rats exhibited a significant increase in the gain of body weight, , and lipids compared to LF rats. HFF rats also showed hepatic insulin resistance, together with an increase in plasma triglycerides, cholesterol, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Hepatic lipids, triglycerides and cholesterol were higher in HFF rats, while a significant decrease in Stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity was found in this tissue. A marked increase in the protein amount of complex I, concomitant to a decrease in its contribution to mitochondrial respiration, was found in HFF rats. Lipid peroxidation and Nitro-Tyrosine content, taken as markers of oxidative stress, as well as NADPH oxidase activity, were significantly higher in HFF rats, while the antioxidant enzyme catalase decreased in these rats. Myeloperoxidase activity and lipocalin content increased, while peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma decreased in HFF rats. The present results provide evidence that middle-aged rats show susceptibility to a short-term "Western diet", exhibiting altered redox homeostasis, insulin resistance, and early mitochondrial alterations in the liver. Therefore, this type of dietary habits should be drastically limited to pursue a "healthy aging".</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693232>Coordination Polymer to Atomically Thin, Holey, Metal-Oxide Nanosheets for Tuning Band Alignment.</a></h2><p>Holey 2D metal oxides have shown great promise as functional materials for  storage and catalysts.

The present work reports a metal-based coordination polymer (MCP) strategy to synthesize polycrystalline, holey, metal oxide (MO) nanosheets with thicknesses as low as two-unit cells. The process involves rapid exfoliation of bulk-layered, MCPs (Ce-, Ti-, Zr-based) into atomically thin MCPs at room temperature, followed by transformation into holey 2D MOs upon the removal of organic linkers in aqueous solution. Further, this work represents an extra step for decorating the holey nanosheets using precursors of transition metals to engineer their band alignments, establishing a route to optimize their photocatalysis.

The incorporation of genomic tools may help to accelerate selection. We genotyped 529 individuals using a high-density SNP chip (600 K, Affymetrix®) to estimate genomic heritability of performance traits and to identify genomic regions and their positional candidate genes associated with performance traits in a Brazilian F Chicken Resource population. Regions exhibiting selection signatures and a SNP dataset from resequencing were integrated with the genomic regions identified using the chip to refine the list of positional candidate genes and identify potential causative mutations.Feed intake (FI), feed conversion ratio (FC), feed efficiency (FE) and weight gain (WG) exhibited low genomic heritability values (i.e. from 0.0002 to 0.13), while body weight at hatch (BW1), 35 days-of-age (BW35), and 41 days-of-age (BW41) exhibited high genomic heritability values (i.e. from 0.60 to 0.73) in this F population. Twenty unique 1-Mb genomic windows were associated with BW1, BW35 or BW41, located on GGA1-4, 6-7, 10, 14, 24, 27 and 28. Thirty-eight positional candidate genes were identified within these windows, and three of them overlapped with selection signature regions. Thirteen predicted deleterious and three high impact sequence SNPs in these QTL regions were annotated in 11 positional candidate genes related to osteogenesis, skeletal muscle development, growth,  metabolism and lipid metabolism, which may be associated with body weight in chickens.The use of a high-density SNP array to identify QTL which were integrated with whole genome sequence signatures of selection allowed the identification of candidate genes and candidate causal variants. One novel QTL was detected providing additional information to understand the genetic architecture of body weight traits. We identified QTL for body weight traits, which were also associated with fatness in the same population. Our findings form a basis for further functional studies to elucidate the role of specific genes in regulating body weight and fat deposition in chickens, generating useful information for poultry breeding programs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693959>Environmental analysis of a nano-grid: A Life Cycle Assessment.</a></h2><p>Renewable  sources are fundamental to face the problem of climate changes. Unfortunately, some resources, such as wind and solar radiation, have fluctuations affecting the electrical grids stability.  storage systems can be used for a smart  management to accumulate power from renewable sources. For such reason, these devices play a key role to achieve a sustainable electric system. On the other hand, they are affected by some environmental drawbacks mainly connected with the depletion of rare and expensive materials. Based on these considerations, in this study a nano-grid composed by a photovoltaic plant, a backup generator and an  storage system is analysed by an environmental Life Cycle Assessment approach. A Solar Home System is designed, and its environmental profile is evaluated considering several Lithium-ion batteries. Among them, nickel-cobalt aluminium oxide cells resulted to be the most suitable solution for a Solar Home System (46.66 Pts/MWh). Moreover, a sensitivity analysis of the Solar Home System is performed and a hybrid  storage plant integrating hydrogen and batteries is proposed to face the problem of seasonal solar radiation variability. Four scenarios having different gas pressure levels and lifespan of the devices are considered. Results show that currently the most sustainable configuration is represented by the Solar Home System, but in the future a hybrid nano-grid equipped with 700 bar hydrogen storage might be the best off-grid configuration for minimizing the impact on the environment (37.77 Pts/MWh). Extending the perspective of our analysis to future on-grid potential configurations, an efficient connection of the Solar Home System with a smart-grid is assessed as it looks more sustainable than other off-grid solutions (22.81 Pts/MWh).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Modern treatment algorithms fall into two broad categories: 1) percutaneous posterior pelvic fixation (iliosacral or transiliac-transsacral screws) or 2) lumbopelvic fixation. Posterior pelvic screw fixation is minimally invasive but typically requires restricted weight bearing until fracture union. In many cases, lumbopelvic fixation allows for a closed reduction and provides stability to allow full weight bearing immediately after surgery; however, this fixation is often removed in a second surgery after fracture healing. Lumbopelvic fixation was originally described as an open procedure, minimally invasive lumbopelvic fixation is a recent variation and has shown promising results with less morbidity. We present a case series of unstable U-type sacral fractures treated with minimally invasive lumbopelvic fixation with staged hardware removal to illustrate the advantages and complications associated with this new technique. Ten patients with U-type sacral fractures underwent minimally invasive lumbopelvic fixation from 2016 to 2019. Six patients underwent scheduled hardware removal an average of 3.5 (range 1.9-5.5) months after index surgery. Two patients did not undergo hardware removal due to short life expectancy and diagnosis of pathologic fractures. One patient was lost to follow-up. One patient had failed fracture reduction and went on to sacral malunion that required a late sacral extension osteotomy to restore her ability to stand upright. Final disposition of all nine patients with follow-up was normal standing upright posture and normal ambulation without assistive device. There were no late displacements on postoperative upright radiographs. Complex sacral fractures are a challenging injury that can be treated with percutaneous posterior pelvic or lumbopelvic fixation. Lumbopelvic fixation offers the advantages of closed reduction to restore pelvic incidence and immediate weight bearing but has greater surgical morbidity than percutaneous posterior pelvic fixation and often requires hardware removal. The morbidity of lumbopelvic fixation may be reduced with minimally invasive techniques. Minimally invasive lumbopelvic fixation is a treatment option to be considered for complex sacral fractures.Copyright © 2019, Shah et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695078>Preventative and Therapeutic Effects of Low-dose Ionizing Radiation on the Allergic Response of Rat Basophilic Leukemia Cells.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of allergies has increased over the last four decades. In allergic reactions, mast cells induce a hypersensitive immune response to a substance that is normally harmless. Ionizing radiation has different biological effects depending on the dose and dose rate. In this study, we investigated whether low-dose irradiation before (preventative effect) or after (therapeutic effect) an antigen-antibody reaction has an anti-allergic effect. To test this, we activated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cells with anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl IgE (antibody) and 2,4-dinitrophenyl human serum albumin, which served as an antigen. To test for both the potential of a preventative effect and a therapeutic effect, we irradiated mast cells both before and after mast cell activation, and we measured mediator release and signaling pathway activity. Low-dose ionizing radiation suppressed mediator release from RBL-2H3 mast cells activated by the antigen-antibody reaction regardless of when the mast cells were irradiated. These results were due to the suppression of FcεRI expression. Therefore, we suggest that low-dose ionizing radiation has a preventative and therapeutic effect in allergic reactions via the FcεRI-mediated RBL-2H3 mast cell activation system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694372>Molecular Engineering on Bis(Benzothiophene-S,S-Dioxide)-Based Large Band-Gap Polymers for Interfacial Modifications in Polymer Solar Cells.</a></h2><p>The development of effectively universal interfacial materials for both conventional and inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs) plays a very crucial role in achieving highly photovoltaic performance and feasible device engineering. In this study, two novel alcohol-soluble conjugated polymers (PBSON-P and PBSON-FEO) with bis(benzothiophene-S,S-dioxide)-fused aromatics (FBTO) as core unit and amino as functional groups are synthesized. They are utilized as universal cathode interfacial layers for both conventional and inverted PSCs simultaneously. Ascribing to the enlarged conjugated planarity and higher electron affinity for FBTO unit, both of PBSON-P and PBSON-FEO exhibit versatile electron-transporting abilities. They show wide band gaps that are important for light absorption in inverted PSCs, at which point PBSON-P and PBSON-FEO are more progressive than some of the reported small band-gap cathode interfacial materials. Importantly, PBSON-P and PBSON-FEO display deep HOMO  levels, which can block holes at the cathode and thus increase fill factor. As a result, both of conventional and inverted PSCs using PBSON-P and PBSON-FEO as cathode interlayers realize high photovoltaic performance.

Such disturbances not only affect cellular  metabolism, but also alter a range of indispensable cellular homeostatic functions in which mitochondria are known to be involved. These range from cellular differentiation, cell death pathways and cellular remodeling to physical barrier function and innate immunity, all of which are known to be impacted by exposure to cigarette smoke and have been linked to COPD pathogenesis. Next to their well-established role as the first physical frontline against external insults, lung epithelial cells are immunologically active. Malfunctioning epithelial cells with defective mitochondria are unable to maintain homeostasis and respond adequately to further stress or injury, which may ultimately shape the phenotype of lung diseases. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of cigarette smoke on the development of mitochondrial dysfunction in the lung epithelium and highlight the consequences for cell function, innate immune responses, epithelial remodeling and epithelial barrier function in COPD.

MIEX and C/F pretreatments were not effective to remove C1 and C2, which were associated with relatively small sized and hydrophilic molecules. GAC adsorption did not show any preference with the removal towards different components. These differences in the chemical heterogeneity among the variously pretreated leachates led to the discrepancies in membrane fluxes at a similar leachate concentration. The result also signified the importance of probing the chemical composition of pretreated leachate for the optimization of the post membrane filtration. The sum of C2 and C3 in the pretreated leachate showed a good correlation with reversible membrane fouling resistance (r = 0.93; p < 0.05), while C1 was highly correlated with irreversible membrane resistance (r = 0.872; P < 0.05). These findings provided a new insight into the applicability of fluorescence spectroscopy for tracking the changes in the membrane fouling potential of stabilized landfill leachate after various pretreatments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Brucellosis prediction plays an important role in its prevention and treatment. This paper establishes relationships between human brucellosis (HB) and land surface temperature (LST), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). A seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous variables (SARIMAX) model is constructed to predict trends in brucellosis rates. The fitted results (Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) = 807.58, Schwarz Bayes Criterion (SBC) = 819.28) showed obvious periodicity and a rate of increase of 138.68% from January 2011 to May 2016. We found a significant effect between HB and NDVI. At the same time, the prediction part showed that the highest monthly incidence per year has a decreasing trend after 2015. This may be because of the brucellosis prevention and control measures taken by the Chinese Government. The proposed model allows the early detection of brucellosis outbreaks, allowing more effective prevention and control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695871>Is timing of reproduction according to temperature sums an optimal strategy?</a></h2><p>Temperature sums are widely used to predict the seasonal timing of yearly recurring biological events, such as flowering, budburst, and hatching. We use a classic  allocation model for annual plants to compare a strategy for reproductive timing that follows a temperature sum rule (TSR) with a strategy that follows an optimal control rule (OCR) maximizing reproductive output. We show that the OCR corresponds to a certain TSR regardless of how temperature is distributed over the growing season as long as the total temperature sum over the whole growing season is constant between years. We discuss such scenarios, thus outlining under which type of variable growth conditions TSR maximizes reproductive output and should be favored by natural selection. By providing an ultimate explanation for a well-documented empirical pattern this finding enhances the credibility of temperature sums as predictors of the timing of biological events. However, TSR and OCR respond in opposite directions when the total yearly temperature sum changes between years, representing, for example, variation in the length of the growing season. Our findings have implications for predicting optimal responses of organisms to climatic changes and suggest under which conditions natural selection should favor photoperiod versus temperature control.© 2019 The Authors.

New approaches are needed to improve respiratory health and reduce premature mortality of chronic diseases by 30% till 2030 (UN Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs). Planetary health is defined as the health of human civilization and the state of the natural systems on which it depends. Planetary health and human health are interconnected, and both need to be considered by individuals and governments while addressing several SDGs.The concept of the Nature Step has evolved from innovative research indicating, how changed lifestyle in urban surroundings reduces contact with biodiverse environments, impoverishes microbiota, affects immune regulation and increases risk of NCDs. The Nature Step calls for strengthening connections to nature. Physical activity in natural environments should be promoted, use of fresh vegetables, fruits and water increased, and consumption of sugary drinks, tobacco and alcohol restricted. Nature relatedness should be part of everyday life and especially emphasized in the care of children and the elderly. Taking "nature" to modern cities in a controlled way is possible but a challenge for urban planning, nature conservation, housing, traffic arrangements,  production, and importantly for supplying and distributing food. Actions against the well-known respiratory risk factors, air pollution and smoking, should be taken simultaneously.In Finland and elsewhere in Europe, successful programmes have been implemented to reduce the burden of respiratory disorders and other NCDs. Unhealthy behaviour can be changed by well-coordinated actions involving all stakeholders. The growing public health concern caused by NCDs in urban surroundings cannot be solved by health care alone; a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory.© The Author(s) 2019.</p></html>
