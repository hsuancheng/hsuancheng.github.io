However, it remains controversial issue that glucose intolerance on pheochromocytoma is caused by impaired  secretion and/or by increased . We aimed to reveal the mechanism of glucose intolerance on pheochromocytoma with regard to the type and amount of catecholamines released. We evaluated 12 individuals diagnosed with pheochromocytoma and who underwent surgery to remove it. We examined glycemic parameters before and after surgery and investigated the association between the change of parameters of  secretion (homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β)),  (homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR)) and that of urinary levels of metanephrine/normetanephrine before and after surgery. Overall, fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), HOMA-β, and HOMA-IR were improved significantly after surgery. Regression analysis showed that the improvement in HOMA-β from before to after surgery was significantly positively associated with an improvement in urinary levels of metanephrine from before to after surgery and showed a significantly negative association with improvement in urinary levels of normetanephrine from before to after surgery. The improvement in HOMA-IR from before to after surgery was significantly positively associated with an improvement in urinary levels of normetanephrine from before to after surgery. Our results showed that pheochromocytoma extirpation improved glycemic parameters. Furthermore, the different effects elicited by excess amounts of adrenaline and noradrenaline on glucose intolerance were demonstrated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27411013>Lack of Adipocyte AMPK Exacerbates  and Hepatic Steatosis through Brown and Beige Adipose Tissue Function.</a></h2><p>Brown (BAT) and white (WAT) adipose tissues play distinct roles in maintaining whole-body energy homeostasis, and their dysfunction can contribute to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular energy sensor, but its role in regulating BAT and WAT metabolism is unclear. We generated an inducible model for deletion of the two AMPK β subunits in adipocytes (iβ1β2AKO) and found that iβ1β2AKO mice were cold intolerant and resistant to β-adrenergic activation of BAT and beiging of WAT. BAT from iβ1β2AKO mice had impairments in mitochondrial structure, function, and markers of mitophagy. In response to a high-fat diet, iβ1β2AKO mice more rapidly developed liver steatosis as well as glucose and  intolerance. Thus, AMPK in adipocytes is vital for maintaining mitochondrial integrity, responding to pharmacological agents and thermal stress, and protecting against nutrient-overload-induced NAFLD and .Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In age and gender adjusted stepwise regression analyses, arterial norepinephrine concentration alone explained 19% of the variance in  clearance. When all significant variables were entered into the regression model, arterial norepinephrine, AI, gender, and M were independent predictors of  clearance, together explaining 41% of the variance.Arterial norepinephrine concentration is inversely and independently associated with whole-body  clearance rate in obese individuals with metabolic syndrome.

Because type 1 diabetic rats also develop impaired baroreflex-mediated NTS activation, we hypothesized that improving glycemic control in OZR would enhance compromised baroreflexes and NTS activation. Fasting blood glucose measured by telemetry was comparable in OZR and lean Zucker rats (LZR) at 12-17 wk. However, with access to food, OZR were chronically hyperglycemic throughout this age range. By 15-17 wk of age, tail samples yielded higher glucose values than those measured by telemetry in OZR but not LZR, consistent with reports of exaggerated stress responses in OZR. Injection of glucose (1g/kg ip) produced larger rises in glucose and areas under the curve in OZR than LZR. Treatment with metformin (300 mg·kg·day) or pioglitazone (5 mg·kg·day) in drinking water for 2-3 wk normalized fed glucose levels in OZR with no effect in LZR. After metformin treatment, area under the curve for blood glucose after glucose injection was reduced in OZR and comparable to LZR. Hyperinsulinemia was slightly reduced by each treatment in OZR, but  was still greatly elevated compared with LZR. Neither treatment reduced hypertension in OZR, but both treatments significantly improved the blunted phenylephrine-induced bradycardia and NTS c-Fos expression in OZR with no effect in LZR. These data suggest that restoring glycemic control in OZR enhances baroreflex control of heart rate by improving the response of the NTS to raising arterial pressure, even in the presence of hyperinsulinemia and hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29782959>Targeting central β2 receptors ameliorates streptozotocin-induced neuroinflammation via inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase3 pathway in mice.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is portrayed by progressive cognitive decline and pathological deposition of amyloid plaques as well as neurofibrillary tangles. Most of AD cases are sporadic, resulting from overlap of various environmental and genetic factors. Intra-cerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ) leads to  brain state accompanied by memory decline, oxidative stress, and neuro-degeneration which mimic the pathologies associated with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD). In the current study, protective effects of formoterol in STZ-induced SAD were studied. Formoterol-induced improvement in cognition was confirmed using Morris water maze and Y maze together with histopathological evidences. Moreover, prominent declines in oxidative stress, neuro-inflammation, and apoptotic parameters were recorded upon its injection in STZ-induced SAD mouse model. This was manifested by the decrement of malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and caspase-3levels contrary to reduced glutathione and interleukin-10 increments. Formoterol also reversed STZ-induced alteration in acetylcholine and glutamate levels. Furthermore, it could be concluded that formoterol was capable of combating STZ-induced neuro-inflammation and retarding the development of the main pathological hallmarks of AD through glycogen synthase kinase-3 deactivation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Arginine and exercise are important non-pharmacological strategies for mitigating the impact of metabolic changes in the metabolic syndrome, but the effect of their combined administration is unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the isolated and combined effects of aerobic training and arginine supplementation on metabolic variables and vascular reactivity in rats at high risk for developing the metabolic syndrome. Wistar rats were divided into two groups: control and fructose (F - water with 10 % fructose). After 2 weeks, the F group was divided into four groups: F, fructose+arginine (FA, 880 mg/kg per d of l-arginine), fructose+training (FT) and fructose+arginine+training (FTA); treatments lasted for 8 weeks, and no difference was observed in body mass gain. Arginine did not improve the body protein content, and both the FA and FT groups show a reversal of the increase in adipose tissue.  increase was prevented by training and arginine, without additive effect, and the increase in serum TAG was prevented only by training. The F group showed impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation and hyperreactivity to phenylephrine, but arginine and training were capable of preventing these effects, even separately. Higher nitric oxide level was observed in the FA and FT groups, and no potentiating effect was detected. Thus, only training was able to prevent the increase in TAG and improve the protein mass, and training and arginine exert similar effects on fat content,  and endothelial function, but these effects are not additive.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30359371>N-substituted phenylbenzamides of the niclosamide chemotype attenuate obesity related changes in high fat diet fed mice.</a></h2><p>Obesity and insulin resistance are primary risk factors for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is generally exhibited by non-progressive simple steatosis. However, a significant subset of patient's progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () that is defined by the presence of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte injury with fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD or  and therefore therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Niclosamide is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anthelmintic drug that mediates its effect by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Niclosamide and its salt forms, Niclosamide  (NEN), and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have shown efficacy in murine models of diet induced obesity characterized by attenuation of the prominent fatty liver disease phenotype and improved glucose metabolism. While the exact mechanism(s) underlying these changes remains unclear, the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased energy expenditure and lipid metabolism or attenuation of PKA mediated glucagon signaling in the liver have been proposed. Unfortunately, niclosamide has very poor water solubility, leading to low oral bioavailability. This, in addition to mitochondrial uncoupling activity and potential genotoxicity have reduced enthusiasm for its clinical use. More recently, salt forms of niclosamide, NEN and NPP, have demonstrated improved oral bioavailability while retaining activity. This suggests that development of safer more effective niclosamide derivatives for the treatment of NAFLD and Type 2 Diabetes may be possible. Herein we explored the ability of a series of N-substituted phenylbenzamide derivatives of the niclosamide salicylanilide chemotype to attenuate hepatic steatosis using a novel phenotypic in vitro model of fatty liver and the high fat diet-fed mouse model of diet induced obesity. These studies identified novel compounds with improved pre-clinical properties that attenuate hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. These compounds with improved drug properties may be useful in alleviating symptoms and protection against disease progression in patients with metabolic syndrome and NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27940403>Markers of sympathetic nervous system activity associate with complex plasma lipids in metabolic syndrome subjects.</a></h2><p>Plasma sphingolipids including ceramides, and gangliosides are associated with  (IR) through effects on  signalling and glucose metabolism.

We have therefore investigated possible associations of IR and SNS activity with complex lipids that are involved in both  sensitivity and neurotransmission.We performed a cross-sectional assessment of 23 lipid classes/subclasses (total 339 lipid species) by tandem mass spectrometry in 94 overweight untreated subjects with IR (quantified by HOMA-IR, Matsuda index and plasma ).Independently of IR parameters, several circulating complex lipids associated significantly with arterial NE and NEFA (non-esterified fatty acids) and marginally with heart rate (HR). After accounting for BMI, HOMA-IR, systolic BP, age, gender, and correction for multiple comparisons, these associations were significant (p < 0.05): NE with ceramide, phosphatidylcholine, alkyl- and alkenylphosphatidylcholine and free cholesterol; NEFA with mono- di- and trihexosylceramide, G ganglioside, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, alkyl- and alkenylphosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol and free cholesterol; HR marginally (p = or <0.1>0.05) with ceramide, G ganglioside, sphingomyelin, lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, lysophosphatidylinositol and free cholesterol.

We hypothesised that sleep restriction would alter hormones that are known to stimulate lipolysis and lead to an increase in NEFA levels.We studied 19 healthy young men under controlled laboratory conditions with four consecutive nights of 8.5 h in bed (normal sleep) and 4.5 h in bed (sleep restriction) in randomised order. The 24 h blood profiles of NEFA, growth hormone (GH), noradrenaline (norepinephrine), cortisol, glucose and  were simultaneously assessed.  sensitivity was estimated by a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test.Sleep restriction relative to normal sleep resulted in increased NEFA levels during the nocturnal and early-morning hours. The elevation in NEFA was related to prolonged nocturnal GH secretion and higher early-morning noradrenaline levels.  sensitivity was decreased after sleep restriction and the reduction in  sensitivity was correlated with the increase in nocturnal NEFA levels.Sleep restriction in healthy men results in increased nocturnal and early-morning NEFA levels, which may partly contribute to  and the elevated diabetes risk associated with sleep loss.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30414175>Triticum aestivum ethanolic extract improves non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in mice fed a choline-deficient or high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>Although non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become more prevalent with the rapid increase of obesity worldwide, no specific treatment has been developed.

Whilst weight loss is known to enhance  clearance, there is a paucity of data concerning the underlying mechanisms. This study was conducted to examine the inter-relationships between changes in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, vascular function and  clearance during a weight loss program.Seventeen non-smoking, un-medicated individuals aged 55 ± 1 years (mean ± SEM), body mass index (BMI) 33.9 ± 1.7 kg/m(2), underwent a 4-month hypocaloric diet (HCD), using a modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, whilst seventeen age- and BMI-matched subjects acted as controls.  sensitivity and  clearance were assessed via euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (exogenous  clearance); hepatic  extraction was calculated as fasting C-peptide to  ratio (endogenous  clearance); SNS activity was quantified by microneurographic nerve recordings of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and whole-body norepinephrine kinetics; and vascular function by calf venous occlusion plethysmography and finger arterial tonometry.Weight loss averaged -8.3 ± 0.6% of body weight in the HCD group and was accompanied by increased clamp-derived glucose utilization (by 20 ± 9%, P = 0.04) and exogenous  clearance (by 12 ± 5%, P = 0.02). Hepatic  extraction increased from 6.3 ± 0.8 to 7.1 ± 0.9 (P = 0.09).

The reduction of choline was significantly related to 2-year improvements in glucose and . We found significant linkages between dietary fat intake and ΔTMAO for changes in fasting glucose,  and HOMA-IR (p <0.05); a greater increase in TMAO was related to lesser improvements in the outcomes among participants who consumed a high-fat diet. In addition, ΔL-carnitine and Δcholine were significantly related to changes in amino acids (including branched-chain and aromatic amino acids). Interestingly, the associations of ΔTMAO, Δcholine and ΔL-carnitine with diabetes-related traits were independent of the changes in amino acids.Our findings underscore the importance of changes in TMAO, choline and L-carnitine in improving  sensitivity during a weight-loss intervention for obese patients.

Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that overexpression of NR4A3 (NOR-1, MINOR) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes enhances -stimulated glucose uptake. To assess the in vivo effect of NR4A3 on adipocytes, we generated transgenic mice with NR4A3 overexpression driven by the adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (AP2) promoter (AP2-NR4A3 mice). We hypothesized that AP2-NR4A3 mice would display enhanced glucose tolerance and  sensitivity. However, AP2-NR4A3 mice exhibit metabolic impairment, including increased fasting glucose and , impaired glucose tolerance, , decreased serum free fatty acids, and increased low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. AP2-NR4A3 mice also display a significant reduction in serum epinephrine due to increased expression of catecholamine-catabolizing enzymes in adipose tissue, including monoamine oxidase-A. Furthermore, enhanced expression of monoamine oxidase-A is due to direct transcriptional activation by NR4A3. Finally, AP2-NR4A3 mice display cardiac and behavioral alterations consistent with chronically low circulating epinephrine levels. In conclusion, overexpression of NR4A3 in adipocytes produces a complex phenotype characterized by impaired glucose metabolism and low serum catecholamines due to enhanced degradation by adipose tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27585927>Piracetam Facilitates the Anti-Amnesic but not Anti-Diabetic Activity of Metformin in Experimentally Induced Type-2 Diabetic Encephalopathic Rats.</a></h2><p>Piracetam exhibits anti-amnesic activity in several animal models of dementia. However, its anti-amnesic potential has yet to be evaluated in type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-induced encephalopathy. Therefore, in the present study, piracetam (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) was screened for anti-amnesic and anti-diabetic activity in T2DM-induced encephalopathic male rats. Subsequently, anti-amnesic and anti-diabetic activities were evaluated for piracetam, metformin and their combination in T2DM-induced encephalopathic animals. Rats received streptozotocin (45 mg/kg) and nicotinamide (110 mg/kg) injections on day-1 (D-1) of the experimental schedule and were kept undisturbed for 35 days to exhibit T2DM-induced encephalopathy. All drug treatments were continued from D-7 to D-35 in both experiments. Piracetam (100 mg/kg) attenuated loss in learning and memory in terms of increase in escape latency on D-4 (D-34) and decrease in time spent in the target quadrant on D-5 (D-35) of Morris water maze test protocol, and spatial memory in terms of reduced spontaneous alternation behavior in Y-maze test of encephalopathic rats. Additionally, piracetam attenuated altered levels of fasting plasma glucose and , HOMA-IR and HOMA-B in encephalopathic animals, comparatively lesser than metformin. In the next experiment, combination of piracetam and metformin exhibited better anti-amnesic but not anti-diabetic activity than respective monotherapies in encephalopathic rats. Further, the combination attenuated reduced acetylcholine level and increased acetylcholinesterase activity, increased glycogen synthase kinase-3β level and decreased brain-derived neurotropic factor level in hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex of encephalopathic animals.

Lipid overload induces  in muscle and alters the composition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). To test the hypothesis that skeletal muscle phospholipid metabolism regulates systemic glucose metabolism, we perturbed choline/ phosphotransferase 1 (CEPT1), the terminal enzyme in the Kennedy pathway of phospholipid synthesis. In C2C12 cells, CEPT1 knockdown altered SR phospholipid composition and calcium flux. In mice, diet-induced obesity, which decreases  sensitivity, increased muscle CEPT1 expression. In high-fat diet-fed mice with skeletal muscle-specific knockout of CEPT1, systemic and muscle-based approaches demonstrated increased muscle  sensitivity. In CEPT1-deficient muscles, an altered SR phospholipid milieu decreased sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase-dependent calcium uptake, activating calcium-signaling pathways known to improve  sensitivity. Altered muscle SR calcium handling also rendered these mice exercise intolerant. In obese humans, surgery-induced weight loss increased  sensitivity and decreased skeletal muscle CEPT1 protein. In obese humans spanning a spectrum of metabolic health, muscle CEPT1 mRNA was inversely correlated with  sensitivity. These results suggest that high-fat feeding and obesity induce CEPT1, which remodels the SR to preserve contractile function at the expense of  sensitivity.© 2016 by the American Diabetes Association.

The current study builds upon our previous association studies highlighting that A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 28 (ADAM28) appears to be implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans. Our novel study characterised the expression of ADAM28 in mice with the metabolic syndrome and used molecular inhibition approaches to investigate the functional role of ADAM28 in the pathogenesis of high fat diet-induced obesity. We identified that ADAM28 mRNA and protein expression was markedly increased in the livers of mice with the metabolic syndrome. In addition, noradrenaline, the major neurotransmitter of the sympathetic nervous system, results in elevated  mRNA expression in human monocytes. Downregulation of ADAM28 with siRNA technology resulted in a lack of weight gain, promotion of  sensitivity/glucose tolerance and decreased liver tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels in our diet-induced obesity mouse model as well as reduced blood urea nitrogen, alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase. In addition, we show that ADAM28 knock-out mice also displayed reduced body weight, elevated high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and reductions in blood urea nitrogen, alkaline phosphatase, and aspartate aminotransferase. The results of this study provide important insights into the pathogenic role of the metalloproteinase ADAM28 in the metabolic syndrome and suggests that downregulation of ADAM28 may be a potential therapeutic strategy in the metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27723801>Evaluation of Methionine Content in a High-Fat and Choline-Deficient Diet on Body Weight Gain and the Development of Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis in Mice.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a globally recognized liver disease.

To resolve this issue, we examined the effects of methionine content in a high-fat and choline-deficient (HFCD) diet on body weight and the development of NASH in mice.C57BL/6J mice (male, 10 weeks of age) were fed an L-amino acid rodent (control) diet, high-fat (HF) diet, or HFCD diet containing various amounts of methionine (0.1-0.6% (w/w)) for 12 weeks. Plasma lipid levels, hepatic lipid content and inflammatory marker gene expression were measured, and a pathological analysis was conducted to evaluate NASH.The 0.1% methionine in HFCD diet suppressed body weight gain, which was lower than that with control diet. On the other hand, the 0.2% methionine in HFCD diet yielded similar body weight gains as the control diet, while more than 0.4% methionine showed the same body weight gains as the HF diet. Liver weights and hepatic lipid contents were the greatest with 0.1% methionine and decreased in a methionine dose-dependent manner. Pathological analysis, NAFLD activity scores and gene expression levels in the liver revealed that 0.1% and 0.2% methionine for 12 weeks induced NASH, whereas 0.4% and 0.6% methionine attenuated the induction of NASH by HFCD diet.

At baseline, fecal microbiota composition differed significantly between vegans and metabolic syndrome patients. With vegan-donor fecal microbiota transplantation, intestinal microbiota composition in metabolic syndrome patients, as monitored by global fecal microbial community structure, changed toward a vegan profile in some of the patients; however, no functional effects from vegan-donor fecal microbiota transplantation were seen on TMAO production, abdominal aortic F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, or ex vivo cytokine production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Single lean vegan-donor fecal microbiota transplantation in metabolic syndrome patients resulted in detectable changes in intestinal microbiota composition but failed to elicit changes in TMAO production capacity or parameters related to vascular inflammation.URL: http://www.trialregister.nl.

Beta-blockers, which are divided as vasodilators or non-vasodilators, are used in the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. Vasodilators have been shown to be of particular benefit in both blood pressure control and other cardiometabolic components with limited disturbance in metabolic parameters. Nebivolol, a third-generation beta-blocker (BB), acts by increasing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. This property may be especially important in NO-deficient population, such as black people, in regulating both blood pressure control and glucose homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26723122>Influence of adipocyte size and adipose depot on the in vitro lipolytic activity and  sensitivity of adipose tissue in dairy cows at the end of the dry period.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present research was to describe characteristics of adipose tissue lipolysis in dairy cows with a variable body condition score (BCS). Ten clinically healthy Holstein Friesian cows were selected based on BCS and euthanized 10 to 13 d before the expected parturition date. Immediately after euthanasia, adipose tissue samples were collected from subcutaneous and omental fat depots. In both depots, we observed an increase in adipocyte size with increasing BCS. Using an in vitro explant culture of subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue, we aimed to determine the influence of adipocyte size and localization of adipose depot on the lipolytic activity in basal conditions and after addition of isoproterenol (nonselective β-agonist) and  in different concentrations. Glycerol release in the medium was used as a measure for lipolytic activity. We observed that the basal lipolytic activity of subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue increased with adipocyte volume, meaning that larger fat cells have higher basal lipolytic activity independent of the location of the adipose depot. Dose-response curves were created between the concentration of isoproterenol or  and the amount of glycerol released. The shape of the dose-response curves is determined by the concentration of isoproterenol and  needed to elicit the half-maximal effect and the maximal amount of stimulated glycerol release or the maximal inhibitory effect of . We observed that larger fat cells released more glycerol upon maximal stimulation with isoproterenol and this was more pronounced in subcutaneous adipose tissue. Additionally, larger fat cells had a higher sensitivity toward lipolytic signals. We observed a trend for larger adipocytes to be more resistant to the maximal antilipolytic effect of . The  concentration needed to elicit the half-maximal inhibitory effect of  was within the physiological range of  and was not influenced by adipocyte size or adipose depot. We conclude that overconditioned cows have larger adipocytes and are predisposed to excessive mobilization of body fat due to a higher basal and stimulated lipolytic activity of large adipocytes while the antilipolytic effect of  is preserved.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

The phospholipid composition was determined using 2D thin-layer chromatography. The level of individual phospholipids was estimated by measuring inorganic phosphorus content. The fatty acid (FA) composition and cholesterol level were investigated by gas-liquid chromatography. Compared to controls, plasma levels of triglycerides and  were significantly increased in IR rats. The pancreas lipid composition indicated a significant reduction of the free cholesterol level and some phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn), phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) compared to controls. Moreover, the FA composition of pancreas showed a significant redistribution of the main FA (18:1n-9, 18:2n-6, 18:3n-6 and 20:4n-6) levels between phospholipid, free FA, triglyceride fractions under IR conditions that was accompanied by a change in the estimated activities of Δ9-, Δ6-, Δ5-desaturase. Administration of N-stearoylethanolamine (NSE, 50 mg/kg daily per os for 2 weeks) IR rats triggered an increase in the content of free cholesterol, PtdCho and normalization of PtdEtn, PtdSer level. Furthermore, the NSE modulated the activity of desaturases, thus influenced FA composition and restored the FA ratios in the lipid fractions. These NSE-induced changes were associated with a normalization of plasma triglyceride content, considerable decrease of  and index HOMA-IR level in rats under IR conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28270520>Functional Human Beige Adipocytes From Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.</a></h2><p>Activation of thermogenic beige adipocytes has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic target in obesity and diabetes. Relevant human models for beige adipocyte differentiation are essential to implement such therapeutic strategies. We report a straightforward and efficient protocol to generate functional human beige adipocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Without overexpression of exogenous adipogenic genes, our method recapitulates an adipogenic developmental pathway through successive mesodermal and adipogenic progenitor stages. hiPSC-derived adipocytes are  sensitive and display beige-specific markers and functional properties, including upregulation of thermogenic genes, increased mitochondrial content, and increased oxygen consumption upon activation with cAMP analogs. Engraftment of hiPSC-derived adipocytes in mice produces well-organized and vascularized adipose tissue, capable of β-adrenergic-responsive glucose uptake. Our model of human beige adipocyte development provides a new and scalable tool for disease modeling and therapeutic screening.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25955207>The CDP- Pathway Regulates Skeletal Muscle Diacylglycerol Content and Mitochondrial Biogenesis without Altering  Sensitivity.</a></h2><p>Accumulation of diacylglycerol (DG) in muscle is thought to cause . DG is a precursor for phospholipids, thus phospholipid synthesis could be involved in regulating muscle DG. Little is known about the interaction between phospholipid and DG in muscle; therefore, we examined whether disrupting muscle phospholipid synthesis, specifically phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn), would influence muscle DG content and  sensitivity. Muscle PtdEtn synthesis was disrupted by deleting CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (ECT), the rate-limiting enzyme in the CDP- pathway, a major route for PtdEtn production. While PtdEtn was reduced in muscle-specific ECT knockout mice, intramyocellular and membrane-associated DG was markedly increased. Importantly, however, this was not associated with . Unexpectedly, mitochondrial biogenesis and muscle oxidative capacity were increased in muscle-specific ECT knockout mice and were accompanied by enhanced exercise performance. These findings highlight the importance of the CDP- pathway in regulating muscle DG content and challenge the DG-induced  hypothesis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Reports on humans are rare. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between dietary choline and betaine intake and IR in humans.We assessed 2394 adults from the CODING (Complex Diseases in the Newfoundland population: Environment and Genetics) study. Intake of dietary choline and betaine was evaluated from the Willett Food Frequency Questionnaire. IR was estimated by homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) and the quantitative -sensitivity check index (QUICKI). Partial correlation analysis was used to determine the correlations of dietary choline and betaine intake with IR adjusted for major confounding factors.Dietary choline and betaine intake was inversely correlated with levels of fasting glucose and , HOMA-IR, HOMA-β (r = -0.08 to -0.27 for choline and r = -0.06 to -0.16 for betaine; P < 0.05) and positively related to QUICKI (r = 0.16-0.25 for choline and r = 0.11-0.16 for betaine; P < 0.01) in both sexes after controlling for age, total calorie intake, and physical activity level. The significant associations disappeared in men after percent trunk fat was added as a confounding factor. Furthermore, individuals with the highest tertile of dietary choline and betaine intake had the lowest IR severity. Dietary choline and betaine intake, however, was the lowest in the high IR group, intermediate in the medium group, and the highest in the low IR group.This study demonstrated that higher intake of dietary choline and betaine is associated with lower IR in the general population.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Mitochondrial uncoupling, which reduces intracellular lipid loads and corrects the underlying cause of , has emerged as a promising anti-obese and anti-diabetic intervention. Niclosamide is an anthelmintic drug approved by the US FDA with the mechanism of action that uncouples mitochondria of parasitic worms. Recently, niclosamide  salt (NEN) was found to be a safe and effective hepatic mitochondrial uncoupler for the prevention and treatment of obesity and T2D in mouse models. The striking features of NEN prompt us to examine the anti-obese and anti-diabetic efficacy of other salt forms of niclosamide, with the ultimate goal to identify a suitable salt formulation for future clinical development. Here, we report the study with niclosamide piperazine salt (NPP), another salt form of niclosamide with documented safety profile.Mitochondrial uncoupling activity of NEN and NPP were determined by oxygen consumption assay with Seahorse XF24e Analyzer, as well as by mitochondrial membrane potential measurement in cultured cells. The in vivo anti-diabetic and anti-obesity activities were determined in C57BL/6J mice fed high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD containing 2000 ppm. NPP for 11 weeks.Niclosamide piperazine salt showed a comparable mitochondrial uncoupling activity to NEN. Oral administration of NPP significantly reduced HFD-induced obesity, hyperglycemia and hepatic steatosis, and sensitized the  responses in mice.Niclosamide piperazine salt may hold the promise to become an alternative to NEN as a drug lead for the treatment of obesity and T2D.

This study investigated the amelioration of apigenin and naringenin in type 2 diabetic (T2D) rats induced by high-fat diet and streptozotocin and explored the underlying mechanism. Apigenin or naringenin was intragastrically administered at 50 or 100mg/kg once a day for 6 weeks. Biochemical parameters including blood glucose, glycated serum protein, serum lipid, , superoxide dismutase (SOD), malonaldehyde and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were measured. Vascular reactivity in isolated thoracic aortic rings was examined. Pathological features of the thoracic aorta were further observed through optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Lastly, we evaluated their effects on  of palmitic acid (PA)-induced endothelial cells. Compared with diabetic control group, apigenin and naringenin significantly decreased the levels of blood glucose, serum lipid, malonaldehyde, ICAM-1 and  index, increased SOD activity and improved impaired glucose tolerance. Apigenin and naringenin restored phenylephrine-mediated contractions and acetylcholine or -induced relaxations in aortic tissues. Furthermore, pathological damage in the thoracic aorta of apigenin and naringenin groups was more remissive than diabetic control group. In vitro, apigenin and naringenin inhibited NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 mRNA expression in PA-treated endothelial cells and improved nitric oxide production in the presence of . In conclusion, both apigenin and naringenin can ameliorate glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as endothelial dysfunction in T2D rats at least in part by down-regulating oxidative stress and inflammation. In general, apigenin showed greater potency than naringenin equivalent.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the role of -responsive GLUT4 in the central nervous system has not been well characterized. To assess its importance, a selective knockout of brain GLUT4 (BG4KO) was generated by crossing Nestin-Cre mice with GLUT4-floxed mice. BG4KO mice had a 99% reduction in GLUT4 protein expression throughout the brain. Despite normal feeding and fasting glycemia, BG4KO mice were glucose intolerant, demonstrated hepatic , and had reduced glucose uptake in the brain. In response to hypoglycemia, BG4KO mice had impaired glucose sensing, noted by impaired epinephrine and glucagon responses and impaired  activation in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Moreover, in vitro glucose sensing of glucose-inhibitory neurons from the ventromedial hypothalamus was impaired in BG4KO mice. In summary, BG4KO mice are glucose intolerant,  resistant, and have impaired glucose sensing, indicating a critical role for brain GLUT4 in sensing and responding to changes in blood glucose.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25672659>Angiotensin II receptor blockers decrease serum concentration of fatty acid-binding protein 4 in patients with hypertension.</a></h2><p>Elevated circulating fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4/A-FABP/aP2), an adipokine, is associated with obesity, , hypertension and cardiovascular events. However, how circulating FABP4 level is modified by pharmacological agents remains unclear. We here examined the effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) on serum FABP4 level. First, essential hypertensives were treated with ARBs: candesartan (8 mg day(-1); n=7) for 2 weeks, olmesartan (20 mg day(-1); n=9) for 12 weeks, and valsartan (80 mg day(-1); n=94) or telmisartan (40 mg day(-1); n=91) for 8 weeks added to amlodipine (5 mg day(-1)). Treatment with ARBs significantly decreased blood pressure and serum FABP4 concentrations by 8-20% without significant changes in adiposity or lipid variables, though the M value determined by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp, a sensitive index of  sensitivity, was significantly increased by candesartan. Next, alterations in FABP4 secretion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes were examined under several agents. Lipolytic stimulation of the β-adrenoceptor in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by isoproterenol increased FABP4 secretion, and conversely,  suppressed FABP4 secretion. However, treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with angiotensin II or ARBs for 2 h had no effect on gene expression or secretion of FABP4 regardless of β-adrenoceptor stimulation. In conclusion, treatment with structurally different ARBs similarly decreases circulating FABP4 concentrations in hypertensive patients as a class effect of ARBs, which is not attributable to blockade of the angiotensin II receptor in adipocytes. Reduction of FABP4 levels by ARBs might be involved in suppression of cardiovascular events.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27130470>Glycyrrhizic acid prevents high calorie diet-induced metabolic aberrations despite the suppression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ expression.</a></h2><p>To investigate the effects of glycyrrhizic acid supplementation on glucose and lipid metabolism in rodents consuming a high-fat, high-sucrose diet.Twenty-four male, 8-week old Sprague Dawley rats with an initial weight of 160 to 200 g were randomised into three groups (n = 6 for each group): groups A (standard rat chow), B (high-fat, high-sucrose diet), and C (high-fat, high-sucrose diet + 100 mg/kg/d of glycyrrhizic acid via oral administration). The rats were treated accordingly for 4 wk. Glycaemic parameters, lipid profile, stress hormones, and adiponectin levels were measured after the treatment. Relative gene expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and γ, lipoprotein lipase as well as gluconeogenic enzymatic activities in different tissues were also determined.Consumption of high-fat, high-sucrose diet triggered hyperglycaemia, , and dyslipidemia, which were effectively attenuated by supplementation with glycyrrhizic acid. Glycyrrhizic acid supplementation also effectively reduced circulating adrenaline, alleviated gluconeogenic enzymes overactivity, and promoted the upregulation of lipoprotein lipase expression in the cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscles. A high calorie diet also triggered hypoadiponectinaemia and suppression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ expression, which did not improve with glycyrrhizic acid treatment.Supplementation with glycyrrhizic acid could alleviate high calorie diet-induced glucose and lipid metabolic dysregulations by reducing circulatory stress hormones, normalizing gluconeogenic enzyme activities, and elevating muscular lipid uptake. The beneficial effects of these bioactivities outweighed the adverse effects caused by diet-induced repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ expression, resulting in the maintenance of lipid and glucose homeostasis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Increased levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite derived from choline and L-carnitine, correlates with CVD and T2DM. However, the precise role of TMAO and its precursors in MetS remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that choline, L-carnitine and TMAO in MetS patients without CVD or T2DM would be altered and correlate with inflammatory markers. Materials and methods This was an exploratory study of 30 patients with nascent MetS (without CVD or T2DM) and 20 matched controls. MetS was defined by the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. TMAO and its precursors were evaluated from each patient's frozen early morning urine samples and quantified using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS). These amines were correlated with a detailed repertoire of biomarkers of inflammation and adipokines. Results L-carnitine was significantly increased (p = 0.0002) compared to controls. There was a trend for a significant increase in TMAO levels (p = 0.08). Choline was not significantly altered in MetS. L-carnitine correlated significantly with soluble tumor necrosis factor 1 (sTNFR1) and leptin, and inversely to adiponectin. TMAO correlated with IL-6, endotoxin and chemerin. Neither choline, nor L-carnitine significantly correlated with TMAO. Conclusion L-carnitine is directly correlated with markers of inflammation in nascent MetS. Cellular L-carnitine could be a biomediator or marker of inflammation in the pathogenesis of MetS, and the sequelae of CVD and T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28403191>Visceral adipose tissue but not subcutaneous adipose tissue is associated with urine and serum metabolites.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a complex multifactorial phenotype that influences several metabolic pathways. Yet, few studies have examined the relations of different body fat compartments to urinary and serum metabolites. Anthropometric phenotypes (visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), the ratio between VAT and SAT (VSR), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC)) and urinary and serum metabolite concentrations measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were measured in a population-based sample of 228 healthy adults. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models, corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate, were used to associate anthropometric phenotypes with metabolites. We adjusted for potential confounding variables: age, sex, smoking, physical activity, menopausal status, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary glucose, and fasting status. In a fully adjusted logistic regression model dichotomized for the absence or presence of quantifiable metabolite amounts, VAT, BMI and WC were inversely related to urinary choline (ß = -0.18, p = 2.73*10-3), glycolic acid (ß = -0.20, 0.02), and guanidinoacetic acid (ß = -0.12, p = 0.04), and positively related to  (ß = 0.18, p = 0.02) and dimethylamine (ß = 0.32, p = 0.02). BMI and WC were additionally inversely related to urinary glutamine and lactic acid. Moreover, WC was inversely associated with the detection of serine. VAT, but none of the other anthropometric parameters, was related to serum essential amino acids, such as valine, isoleucine, and phenylalanine among men. Compared to other adiposity measures, VAT demonstrated the strongest and most significant relations to urinary and serum metabolites. The distinct relations of VAT, SAT, VSR, BMI, and WC to metabolites emphasize the importance of accurately differentiating between body fat compartments when evaluating the potential role of metabolic regulation in the development of obesity-related diseases, such as , type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26587661>Increased Contractile Response to Noradrenaline Induced By Factors Associated with the Metabolic Syndrome in Cultured Small Mesenteric Arteries.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the effect of the metabolic syndrome associated risk factors hyperglycemia (glucose [Glc]), hyperinsulinemia ( [Ins]) and low-grade inflammation (tumor necrosis factor α [TNFα]) on the vasomotor responses of  arteries.

We show total internal reflection microscopy (TIRF) imaging of the dynamic movement of CHT proteins in live cells in response to depolarization and drug treatments. These data show that acute exposure of depolarized cells to  is coupled to transiently increased levels of CHT proteins at the cell surface, and that this is attenuated by chronic  exposure.

(IR) and autonomic nervous system (ANS) imbalance are two principal drivers of PIH development. Few previous researches investigated the association between IR and ANS imbalance in Chinese PIH patients. 120 pregnant women were enrolled in our study, sixty healthy pregnant women (control group), fourty one gestational hypertension (GH group) and nineteen preeclampsia patients (PE group). The homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) and markers of ANS (plasma biomarkers and heart rate variability (HRV) components) were collected. Body mass index (BMI), Ln(HOMA-IR), noradrenaline level, LnTP (total power), Ln SDNN (standard deviation of the normal-to-normal interval), LnLF (low frequency), LnLF/LnHF (low frequency/high frequency) were different in the GH and PE groups compared with the controls. Significant correlations were observed between Ln (HOMA-IR) and gestational duration (r = 0.237, P = 0.031), BMI（r = 0.314, P = 0.002), systolic blood pressure (r = 0.108, P = 0.016), noradrenaline (r = 0.451, P = 0.009), LnTP (r = -0.269, P = 0.015) and LnLF/HF (r = 0.183, P = 0.026) in those PIH patients. Furthermore, BMI, noradrenaline and LnTP were independent determinants of Ln(HOMA-IR) in PIH patients by multiple regression analysis. Our finding verified both IR and ANS imbalance were more severe in PIH patients than healthy pregnant women. Moreover, IR had a close association with ANS parameters in PIH patients, suggesting that they probably had contributory effects on the occurrence and development of PIH. We propose that these parameters could be added to the traditional indexes for individualized treatment of PIH patients in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29857072>Efflux transporters and tight junction expression changes in human gastrointestinal cell lines cultured in defined medium vs serum supplemented medium.</a></h2><p>Many gastrointestinal cell lines including Caco-2, LS174T and RKO require foetal calf serum (FCS) in culture medium. However, when isolating secreted product from conditioned medium (CM), after cell exposure to a trigger, it is better to remove FCS in the culture medium for identification of secreted products of interest. However, it is unknown whether defined medium adversely affects active efflux protein expression and tight junction formation.Using different gastrointestinal cell lines chosen with different levels of efflux transporter expression, fully defined components, such as using transferrin, , selenium and  without FCS or with a reduced percentage of FCS (2%) were tested as an optimal choice for cell growth. In addition to morphological characteristics, the expression of the ABC efflux transporters, ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein [P-gp]), ABCC2 (multidrug  associated protein 2), ABCG2 (breast cancer  protein) and occludin was determined.The cells required a minimum of 2% FCS for expression of transporters. Fully defined medium with no serum adversely affected the expression of transporters, especially P-gp. An important characteristic of Caco-2 cells is its ability to form tight junctions. Caco-2 did not form adequate tight junctions without 10% FCS added in the medium, as evidenced by low TEER values and reduced occluding immunohistochemistry.FCS is required for efflux protein expression and tight junction generation. Nevertheless, it is possible to use 5 fold less FCS which assists with low molecular weight secretion isolation.

We show that hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Arc)POMC-deficient mice, which develop severe obesity and , unexpectedly exhibit improved glucose tolerance and remain protected from hyperglycemia. To explain these paradoxical phenotypes, we hypothesized that an -independent pathway is responsible for the enhanced glucose tolerance. Indeed, the mutant mice demonstrated increased glucose effectiveness and exaggerated glycosuria relative to wild-type littermate controls at comparable blood glucose concentrations. Central administration of the melanocortin receptor agonist melanotan II in mutant mice reversed alterations in glucose tolerance and glycosuria, whereas, conversely, administration of the antagonist Agouti-related peptide (Agrp) to wild-type mice enhanced glucose tolerance. The glycosuria of ArcPOMC-deficient mice was due to decreased levels of renal GLUT 2 (rGLUT2) but not sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 and was associated with reduced renal catecholamine content. Epinephrine treatment abolished the genotype differences in glucose tolerance and rGLUT2 levels, suggesting that reduced renal sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity is the underlying mechanism for the observed glycosuria and improved glucose tolerance in ArcPOMC-deficient mice. Therefore, the ArcPOMC-SNS-rGLUT2 axis is potentially an -independent therapeutic target to control diabetes.© 2016 by the American Diabetes Association.

Here, we hypothesized that a combination of luteolin and l-theanine would synergistically act to improve memory function and glucose disturbances in rats infused with amyloid-β, and the mechanisms underlying these actions were investigated. Rats that received an amyloid-β(25-35) infusion into the CA1 region of the hippocampus were fed dextrin (AD-CON), 0.1% luteolin (AD-Lut), 0.2% l-theanine (AD-Thea), or both 0.05% luteolin and 0.1% l-theanine (AD-LuTh) in conjunction with a high-fat diet over 8 weeks. AD-LuTh improved memory function, as determined by water maze and passive avoidance tests, by potentiating the hippocampal  signaling and reducing inflammation: Luteolin mainly potentiated  signaling via the pAkt➔pGSK➔pTau pathway, and l-theanine primarily reduced tumor necrosis factor-α. In the metabolomics analysis of the hippocampus lysates, the concentration of proline, phenylpyruvic acid, and normetanephrine decreased in the AD-LuTh compared to AD-CON. Norepinephrine contents were lower in the AD-CON than non-AD rats with a high fat diet with 0.2% dextrin, whereas AD-Thea and AD-LuTh inhibited the decrease. Both the AD-Lut and AD-LuTh increased glucose infusion rates and decreased hepatic glucose output under basal and hyperinsulinemic conditions, indicating improved whole-body and hepatic  sensitivity. Disturbances in glucose-stimulated  secretion during hyperglycemic clamp were most effectively corrected by the AD-Lut and AD-LuTh treatments. In conclusion, the hypothesis of the study was accepted. The combination of luteolin and l-theanine prevented Alzheimer disease-like symptom, possibly by improving hippocampal  signaling, norepinephrine metabolisms, and decreasing neuroinflammation. The combination of luteolin and l-theanine may be a useful therapeutic option for preventing and/or delaying the progression of memory dysfunction.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, some patients are 'resistant' to antiplatelet therapy, which increases their risk of developing acute coronary syndromes. These patients often present with an underlying condition that is associated with altered levels of circulating platelet primers and platelet hyperactivity. Platelet primers cannot stimulate platelet activation, but, in combination with physiologic stimuli, significantly enhance platelet function.To explore the role of platelet primers in  to antiplatelet therapy, and to evaluate whether phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) contributes to this process.We used platelet aggregation, thromboxane A2 production and ex vivo thrombus formation as functional readouts of platelet activity. Platelets were treated with the potent P2Y12 inhibitor AR-C66096, aspirin, or a combination of both, in the presence or absence of the platelet primers -like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and thrombopoietin (TPO), or the Gz-coupled receptor ligand epinephrine. We found that platelet primers largely overcame the inhibitory effects of antiplatelet compounds on platelet functional responses. IGF-1-mediated and TPO-mediated, but not epinephrine-mediated, enhancements in the presence of antiplatelet drugs were blocked by the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002.These results demonstrate that platelet primers can contribute to antiplatelet . Furthermore, our data demonstrate that there are PI3K-dependent and PI3K-independent mechanisms driving primer-mediated  to antiplatelet therapy.© 2015 The Authors.

A global hypothesis.</a></h2><p>Exact cause of the metabolic syndrome [MS], a global epidemic, is still unclear. Man has same fundamental needs to live as animals but modern man's life-style compels him to acquire certainty of resources for all his needs in a complex social network. Today money has become the sole life essential need. Contrarily none of the animals needs to earn money. Brain is also an organ of the human body with a unique thought process to define logical actions to achieve a person's goals. This way life is a flow of desires followed by logical actions. The person struggles to attain desired goals via the allostatic load but a perceived insurmountable threat can make his flow of life stalled to freeze him. Published data from varied branches of medical science indicates role of hormones in overall homeostasis. Particularly multifaceted role of serotonin is well documented. Adrenalin being the primary mediator of Cori cycle is also well known. From the integration of observations from published data with reference to common human's modern lifestyle, it is hypothesized that a perceived trapped situation in life creates acute chaos of thoughts in brain, which results in acute excess of stress hormones and concurrent depletion of resting hormones, which in turn triggers MS. In global terms, MS indicates an acute imbalance of a few hormones and implies psychosomatic roots of the disorder. This may pave a better way in deciding a personalized holistic protocol with combination of counter regulatory psychoactive medications.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This diet induces a type 2 diabetes/metabolic syndrome phenotype with hypertension. In diabetic meriones, body weight increase was associated with hyperglycemia, increased insulinemia, and . Compared to lean meriones, diabetic meriones showed decreased aorta contraction to noradrenaline, which was normalized after NOS inhibition. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to carbachol was enhanced, while relaxing effects of the NO donor SNAP and of diazoxide were unchanged. -evoked relaxation was depressed in aorta from diabetic meriones, and L-arginine relaxed contracted arteries from diabetic meriones, but not from lean meriones. Urine NOX level and iNOS mRNA muscle expression were significantly higher in diabetic meriones compared to lean animals.

Thirty-six moderately trained men participated as volunteers in this study. After medical examination, eligible subjects were randomly assigned to one of four groups according to their age: a young training group (21.3 ± 1.3 yrs, YT, n = 9), a young control group (21.4 ± 1.7 yrs, YC, n = 9), a middle-aged training group (40.7 ± 1.8 yrs, AT, n = 9), and a middle-aged control group (40.5 ± 1.8 yrs, AC, n = 9). YT and AT participated in HISST for 13 weeks. Before and after HISST, all participants performed the Wingate Anaerobic Test (WAnT). Blood samples were collected at rest, after warm-up (50% VO), immediately post-WAnT, and 10 min post-WAnT. Before HISST, we observed significantly higher (P < 0.05) glucose concentrations in AT (5.86 ± 0.32 mmol.L) compared to YT (4.24 ± 0.79 mmol.L) at rest, and in response to WAnT (6.56 ± 0.63 mmol.L vs. 5.33 ± 0.81 mmol.L). Cortisol levels were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in AT than in YT in response to WAnT (468 ± 99.50 ng.mL vs. 382 ± 64.34 ng.mL). Catecholamine levels measured at rest and in response to WAnT rose in a similar fashion. After HISST, this "age effect" disappeared at rest and in response to exercise in the trained groups (YT and AT). Changes in hormone concentrations with intense training are due to adaptive changes in various tissues, especially in the skeletal muscle and liver in trained subjects. HISST may, at least in part, counteract the negative "age effect" on glucose metabolism.© 2016 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27677765>Metabolic effects of orally administered small-molecule agonists of GPR55 and GPR119 in multiple low-dose streptozotocin-induced diabetic and incretin-receptor-knockout mice.</a></h2><p>Abnormal cannabidiol (Abn-CBD) and AS-1269574 are potent selective agonists for GPR55 and GPR119, respectively. The present study evaluated the actions and ability of these small-molecule agonists to counteract experimental diabetes in mice.Diabetes was induced in NIH Swiss mice by five consecutive daily intraperitoneal injections of 40 mg/(kg body weight) streptozotocin. Diabetic mice received daily oral administration of Abn-CBD or AS-1269574 (0.1 μmol/kg) or saline vehicle (0.9% wt/vol. NaCl) over 28 days. Body weight, food intake, fluid intake, plasma glucose, , glucose tolerance,  release, lipid profile and pancreatic morphology were examined. Mechanism of action of agonists was assessed in acute studies using incretin-receptor-knockout mice.Abn-CBD and AS-1269574 decreased plasma glucose (20-26%, p < 0.05) and increased circulating  (47-48%, p < 0.05) by 10-28 days, compared with saline-treated diabetic controls. Food intake and polydipsia were reduced by both agonists (21-23%, p < 0.05 and 33-35%, p < 0.01, respectively). After 28 days of treatment, plasma glucagon concentrations were reduced (p < 0.01) and glucose tolerance was enhanced by 19-44% by Abn-CBD (p < 0.05 or p < 0.001) and AS-1269574 (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). Plasma  responses were improved (p < 0.01) and  was decreased (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in both Abn-CBD- and AS-1269574-treated groups. Triacylglycerols were decreased by 19% with Abn-CBD (p < 0.05) and 32% with AS-1269574 (p < 0.01) while total cholesterol was reduced by 17% (p < 0.01) and 15% (p < 0.05), respectively. Both agonists enhanced beta cell proliferation (p < 0.001) although islet area was unchanged. Acute studies in Gipr- and Glp1r-knockout mice revealed an important role for the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor in the actions of both agonists, with the glucose-lowering effects of Abn-CBD also partly mediated through the glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) receptor.These data highlight the potential for fatty acid G-protein-coupled receptor-based therapies as novel insulinotropic and glucose-lowering agents acting partly through the activation of incretin receptors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29750886>Co-administration of conjugated linoleic acid and rosiglitazone increases atherogenic co-efficient and alters isoprenaline-induced vasodilatation in rats fed high fat diet.</a></h2><p>The cis(c)-9, trans(t)-11 (c9,t11) and t10,c12 isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) have been reported as agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and beneficial in lipidemia and glycemia. However, it is unclear whether CLA isomers enhance or antagonize effects of conventional drugs targeting PPAR. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed high fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks and treated without or with CLA, rosiglitazone or both for 4 weeks. Oral glucose tolerance and surrogate markers of  were not significantly different for all treatments compared to untreated normal diet (ND) or HFD group, except lipoprotein levels. The combination of CLA and rosiglitazone had suppressed levels of low and high density lipoproteins (46 % and 25 %, respectively), compared to HFD-alone. Conversely, the atherogenic co-efficient of the animals received HFD or HFD+rosiglitazone+CLA was 2-folds higher than ND, HFD+rosiglitazone or HFD+CLA. Isolated aortic rings from the combined CLA and rosiglitazone treated animals were less sensitive to isoprenaline-induced relaxation among endothelium-denuded aortas with a decreased efficacy and potency (R(max)=53+/-4.7 %; pEC50=6+/-0.2) compared to endothelium-intact aortas (R(max)=100+/-9.9 %; pEC50=7+/-0.2).

By mediating lipolysis in adipose and non-adipose tissues, ATGL is a major regulator of overall energy metabolism and plasma lipid levels. Since chronically high levels of plasma lipids are linked to metabolic disorders including  and type 2 diabetes, ATGL is an interesting therapeutic target. In the present study, fourteen closely related analogues of Atglistatin (1), a newly discovered ATGL inhibitor, were synthesized, and their ATGL inhibitory activity was evaluated. The effect of these analogues on lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes clearly shows that inhibition of the enzyme by Atglistatin (1) is due to the presence of the carbamate and N,N-dimethyl moieties on the biaryl central core at meta and para position, respectively. Mono carbamate-substituted analogue C2, in which the carbamate group was in the meta position as in Atglistatin (1), showed slight inhibition. Low dipole moment of Atglistatin (1) compared to the synthesized analogues possibly explains the lower inhibitory activities.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Nevertheless, it is not clear whether these invertebrate counterparts of norepinephrine are important regulators of metabolic and life history traits. We show that flies (Drosophila melanogaster) lacking OA are more resistant to starvation, while their overall life span is substantially reduced compared with control flies. In addition, these animals have increased body fat deposits, reduced physical activity and a reduced metabolic resting rate. Increasing the release of OA from internal stores induced the opposite effects. Flies devoid of both OA and TA had normal body fat and metabolic rates, suggesting that OA and TA act antagonistically. Moreover, OA-deficient flies show increased  release rates. We inferred that the OA-mediated control of  release accounts for a substantial proportion of the alterations observed in these flies. Apparently, OA levels control the balance between thrifty and expenditure metabolic modes. Thus, changes in OA levels in response to external and internal signals orchestrate behaviour and metabolic processes to meet physiological needs. Moreover, chronic deregulation of the corresponding signalling systems in humans may be associated with metabolic disorders, such as obesity or diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25997585>N-Stearoylethanolamine suppresses the pro-inflammatory cytokines production by inhibition of NF-κB translocation.</a></h2><p>N-Stearoylethanolamine (NSE) is a minor lipid that belongs to the N-Acylethanolamines family that mediates a wide range of biological processes. This study investigates the mechanisms of anti-inflammatory action of NSE on different model systems. Namely, we estimated the effect of NSE on inflammatory cytokines mRNA level (leukemia cells L1210), cytokines content (serum and LPS-stimulated macrophages) and nuclear translocation of NF-κB (peritoneal macrophages LPS-stimulated and isolated from rats with obesity-induced ). The results indicated that NSE dose-dependently inhibits the IL-1 and IL-6 mRNA level in L1210 cells. Furthermore, the NSE treatment triggered a normalization of serum TNF-α level in  resistant rats and a reduction of medium IL-1 level in LPS-activated peritoneal macrophages. These NSE's effects were associated with the inhibition of nuclear NF-κB translocation in rat peritoneal macrophages.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We have now investigated the effects of four types of anesthesia [pentobarbital sodium (PENT), ketamine-xylazine (K/X), and low- or high-dose isoflurane (ISO)] on hemodynamics, cardiac function, and glucose and lipid metabolism in Sprague-Dawley rats. Aortic pressure, heart rate, and echocardiographic parameters were measured at various time points up to 45 min after the induction of anesthesia, and blood was then collected for measurement of parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism. Systolic aortic pressure remained constant in the PENT group, whereas it showed a biphasic pattern in the K/X group and a gradual decline in the ISO groups. Marked bradycardia was observed in the K/X group. The serum glucose concentration was increased and the plasma  level was reduced in the K/X and ISO groups compared with the PENT group. The concentrations of free fatty acids and norepinephrine in plasma were increased in the K/X group. Despite the metabolic effects of K/X and ISO, our results suggest that the marked bradycardic effect of K-X renders this combination appropriate for measurement of Doppler-derived indexes of left ventricular diastolic function, whereas the relative ease with which the depth of anesthesia can be controlled with ISO makes it suitable for manipulations or data collection over long time periods. On the other hand, PENT may be best suited for experiments that focus on measurement of cardiac function by M-mode echocardiography and metabolic parameters.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25767284>The sympathetic nervous system alterations in human hypertension.</a></h2><p>Several articles have dealt with the importance and mechanisms of the sympathetic nervous system alterations in experimental animal models of hypertension.

Dyslipidemia is an important factor in MetS and is related to atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesized that very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) in MetS (MetS-VLDL) may induce atrial dilatation and vulnerability to AF. VLDL was therefore separated from normal (normal-VLDL) and MetS individuals. Wild type C57BL/6 male mice were divided into control, normal-VLDL (nVLDL), and MetS-VLDL (msVLDL) groups. VLDL (15 µg/g) and equivalent volumes of saline were injected via tail vein three times a week for six consecutive weeks. Cardiac chamber size and function were measured by echocardiography.

Besides effective control of blood pressure in patients with hypertension, third-generation beta-blockers such as nebivolol offer additional benefits for central hemodynamics and neutral or beneficial effects on metabolism. Emerging clinical data suggest that nebivolol also has similar effects on metabolism in obese hypertensive and hypertensive diabetic patients.

Subjects attended on 3 occasions and received low (c. 150 nM), medium (c. 400 nM) or high (c. 1400 nM) cortisol infusion in a randomized crossover design. Deuterated glucose and glycerol were infused intravenously along with a pancreatic clamp (somatostatin with replacement of glucagon,  and growth hormone) and adrenaline. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained for analysis. In parallel, the effect of cortisol on lipolysis was tested in paired primary cultures of human subcutaneous and visceral adipocytes.In vivo, high cortisol increased lipolysis only in the presence of high  and/or adrenaline but did not alter glucose kinetics. High cortisol increased adipose mRNA levels of ATGL, HSL and CGI-58 and suppressed G0S2.

However, the effects of restraint stress on cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in metabolic syndrome (MetS) have remained unclear. We investigated the effects of chronic restraint stress and β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) blockade on cardiac and adipose tissue pathology and metabolic disorders in a rat model of MetS. DahlS.Z-Lepr(fa)/Lepr(fa) (DS/obese) rats, derived from a cross between Dahl salt-sensitive and Zucker rats. Rats were exposed to restraint stress (restraint cage, 2 h/day) for 4 wk from 9 wk of age with or without daily subcutaneous administration of the β-AR blocker propranolol (2 mg/kg). Age-matched homozygous lean littermates of DS/obese rats (DahlS.Z-Lepr(+)/Lepr(+) rats) served as control animals. Chronic restraint stress exacerbated hypertension as well as left ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, and oxidative stress in a manner sensitive to propranolol treatment. Restraint stress attenuated body weight gain in DS/obese rats, and this effect tended to be reversed by propranolol (P = 0.0682). Restraint stress or propranolol did not affect visceral or subcutaneous fat mass. However, restraint stress potentiated cardiac and visceral adipose tissue inflammation in DS/obese rats, and these effects were ameliorated by propranolol. Restraint stress also exacerbated glucose intolerance, , and abnormal lipid metabolism in a manner sensitive to propranolol. In addition, restraint stress increased urinary norepinephrine excretion, and propranolol attenuated this effect. Our results thus implicate β-ARs in the exacerbation of cardiac and adipose tissue pathology and abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism induced by restraint stress in this model of MetS.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27335430>Pressor recovery after acute stress is impaired in high fructose-fed Lean Zucker rats.</a></h2><p> is a powerful predictor of cardiovascular disease; however, the mechanistic link remains unclear. This study aims to determine if early cardiovascular changes associated with short-term fructose feeding in the absence of obesity manifest as abnormal blood pressure control. Metabolic dysfunction was induced in Lean Zucker rats by short-term high-fructose feeding. Rats were implanted with telemetry devices for the measurement of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and subjected to air jet stress at 5 and 8 weeks after feeding. Additional animals were catheterized under anesthesia for the determination of MAP and blood flow responses in the hind limb and mesenteric vascular beds to intravenous injection of isoproterenol (0.001-0.5 μm), a β-adrenergic agonist. Metabolic dysfunction in high-fructose rats was not accompanied by changes in 24-h MAP Yet, animals fed a high-fructose diet for 8 weeks exhibited a marked impairment in blood pressure recovery after air-jet stress. Dose-dependent decreases in MAP and peripheral blood flow in response to isoproterenol treatment were significantly attenuated in high-fructose rats.

Brain  deficiency and  may be key events in AD pathology mechanistically linking AD to T2DM.  plasmalogens (PlsEtns) are abundant in the brain and play essential roles in neuronal function and myelin formation. As such, PlsEtn deficiency may be pathologically relevant in some neurodegenerative disorders such as AD. Decreased brain PlsEtn associated with dementia may reflect serum PlsEtn deficiency. We hypothesized that myo-inositol plays a role in myelin formation through its facilitation of PlsEtn biosynthesis. Excessive urinary myo-inositol (UMI) loss would likely result in PlsEtn deficiency potentially leading to demyelinating diseases such as dementia. Accordingly, measurement of both serum PlsEtn and baseline UMI excretion could improve the detection of cognitive impairment (CI) in a more specific and reliable manner. To verify our hypothesis, we conducted a clinical observational study of memory clinic outpatients (MCO) and cognitively normal elderly (NE) for nearly 4.5years. We demonstrated that serum PlsEtn concentration associated with UMI excretion was useful for predicting advancing dementia in patients with mild CI. Because hyperglycemia and associated  might be a leading cause of increased baseline UMI excretion, serum PlsEtn quantitation would be useful in detecting CI among the elderly with hyperglycemia. Our findings suggest that myo-inositol is a novel candidate molecule linking T2DM to AD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the comparison of performing 12 weeks'  training before, after and/or in between aerobic exercise on the hormonal status of aged women. Materials and methods Forty healthy aged women (age: 67.35 ± 1.40 years) were randomly divided into three training groups and a control group:  followed by endurance training (ER, n = 12), endurance training followed by  training (RE, n = 12, interval -endurance (RE) training (INT, n = 12) and a control (Con, n = 12) groups. The training program was done over 12 weeks, 3 times per week. Endurance training was performed on a cycle ergometer (intensity: 60-90% maximum heart rate) and  training involved selected  exercises (intensity: 40-75 one-repetition maximum, 8-18 repeats). All participants were evaluated before and after the training period. Results and conclusion The data showed that performing  training before, after and/or in between aerobic exercise did not influence the adaptive response of  like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (p = 0.07), growth hormone (p = 0.35), cortisol (p = 0.20),  (p = 0.72), epinephrine (p = 0.83) and norepinephrine (p = 0.86) levels throughout the study. However, when comparing pre and post, no significant differences were shown following combined training within the SE, ES and INT groups for all variables (p < 0.05), except of IGF-1 within ES (p = 0.04) and SE (p = 0.02), and testosterone within ES (p = 0.007). In conclusion, combined training with RE order may be more effective than other orders for increasing anabolic status in aged women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28237271>Evidence-based treatments for low sexual desire in women.</a></h2><p>Low sexual desire is the most common sexual complaint in women, with multinational studies finding that at least a third of women experience low sexual desire. No single etiology for the development of Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder, the diagnosis laid out by the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, has been established. There has been considerable interest in pharmacological approaches to improving low desire, and agents targeting a range of neurotransmitters have been examined. To date, only flibanserin, a centrally acting medication targeting the serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine systems, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Despite statistically significant effects on sexual desire, sexual distress, and sexually satisfying events, side-effects are significant, and flibanserin is completely contraindicated with alcohol. As such, there has been renewed interest in advancing the science of psychological approaches to low desire, including cognitive behavioral and mindfulness therapies.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In addition to the classical "Two-hit" theory, NAFLD has been recognized as a typical gut microbiota-related disease because of the intricate role of gut microbiota in maintaining human health and disease formation. Moreover, gut microbiota is even regarded as a "metabolic organ" that play complementary roles to that of liver in many aspects. The mechanisms underlying gut microbiota-mediated development of NAFLD include modulation of host energy metabolism,  sensitivity, and bile acid and choline metabolism. As a result, gut microbiota have been emerging as a novel therapeutic target for NAFLD by manipulating it in various ways, including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and herbal components. In this review, we summarized the most recent advances in gut microbiota-mediated mechanisms, as well as gut microbiota-targeted therapies on NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25249578>Hypothalamic orexin prevents hepatic  via daily bidirectional regulation of autonomic nervous system in mice.</a></h2><p>Circadian rhythm is crucial for preventing hepatic , although the mechanism remains uncovered. Here we report that the wake-active hypothalamic orexin system plays a key role in this regulation. Wild-type mice showed that a daily rhythm in blood glucose levels peaked at the awake period; however, the glucose rhythm disappeared in orexin knockout mice despite normal feeding rhythm. Central administration of orexin A during nighttime awake period acutely elevated blood glucose levels but subsequently lowered daytime glucose levels in normal and diabetic db/db mice. The glucose-elevating and -lowering effects of orexin A were suppressed by adrenergic antagonists and hepatic parasympathectomy, respectively. Moreover, the expression levels of hepatic gluconeogenic genes, including Pepck, were increased and decreased by orexin A at nanomolar and femtomolar doses, respectively. These results indicate that orexin can bidirectionally regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis via control of autonomic balance, leading to generation of the daily blood glucose oscillation. Furthermore, during aging, orexin deficiency enhanced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the liver and caused impairment of hepatic  signaling and abnormal gluconeogenic activity in pyruvate tolerance test. Collectively, the daily glucose rhythm under control of orexin appears to be important for maintaining ER homeostasis, thereby preventing  in the liver.© 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.

However, its function in glucose homeostasis and obesity has been unknown. Here we show that RIPK3 is over expressed in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of obese mice fed with a choline-deficient high-fat diet. Genetic inactivation of Ripk3 promotes increased Caspase-8-dependent adipocyte apoptosis and WAT inflammation, associated with impaired  signalling in WAT as the basis for glucose intolerance. Similarly to mice, in visceral WAT of obese humans, RIPK3 is overexpressed and correlates with the body mass index and metabolic serum markers. Together, these findings provide evidence that RIPK3 in WAT maintains tissue homeostasis and suppresses inflammation and adipocyte apoptosis, suggesting that systemic targeting of necroptosis might be associated with the risk of promoting  in obese patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26891736>Vaccenic acid suppresses intestinal inflammation by increasing anandamide and related N-acylethanolamines in the JCR:LA-cp rat.</a></h2><p>Vaccenic acid (VA), the predominant ruminant-derivedtransfat in the food chain, ameliorates hyperlipidemia, yet mechanisms remain elusive. We investigated whether VA could influence tissue endocannabinoids (ECs) by altering the availability of their biosynthetic precursor, arachidonic acid (AA), in membrane phospholipids (PLs). JCR:LA-cprats were assigned to a control diet with or without VA (1% w/w),cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (1% w/w) or VA+CLA (1% + 0.5% w/w) for 8 weeks. VA reduced the EC, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the liver and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) relative to control diet (P< 0.001), but did not change AA in tissue PLs. There was no additive effect of combining VA+CLA on 2-AG relative to VA alone (P> 0.05). Interestingly, VA increased jejunal concentrations of anandamide and those of the noncannabinoid signaling molecules, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, relative to control diet (P< 0.05). This was consistent with a lower jejunal protein abundance (but not activity) of their degrading enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase, as well as the mRNA expression of TNFα and interleukin 1β (P< 0.05). The ability of VA to reduce 2-AG in the liver and VAT provides a potential mechanistic explanation to alleviate ectopic lipid accumulation. The opposing regulation of ECs and other noncannabinoid lipid signaling molecules by VA suggests an activation of benefit via the EC system in the intestine.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25889404>Xanthine oxidase inhibition alleviates the cardiac complications of : effect on low grade inflammation and the angiotensin system.</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that hyperuricemia plays an important role in the vascular complications of  (IR). Here we investigated the effect of xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibition on the cardiac complications of IR.IR was induced in rats by a high fructose high fat diet for 12 weeks. Allopurinol, a standard XO inhibitor, was administered in the last 4 weeks before cardiac hemodynamics and electrocardiography, serum glucose, , tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), 8-isoprostane, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and XO activity were measured. Expression of cardiac angiotensin II (AngII) and angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) were assessed by immunofluorescence.IR animals had significant hyperuricemia which was inhibited by allopurinol administration. IR was associated with impaired ventricular relaxation (reflected by a decreased diastolic pressure increment and prolonged diastolic duration) and XO inhibition greatly attenuated impaired relaxation. IR was accompanied by cardiac ischemia (reflected by increased QTc and T peak trend intervals) while XO inhibition alleviated the ECG abnormalities. When subjected to isoproterenol-induced ischemia, IR hearts were less resistant (reflected by larger ST height depression and higher LDH level) while XO inhibition alleviated the accompanying ischemia. In addition, XO inhibition prevented the elevation of serum 8-isoprostane and TNFα, and blocked elevated AngII and AT1 receptor expression in the heart tissue of IR animals. However, XO inhibition did not affect the developed hyperinsulinemia or dyslipidemia.XO inhibition alleviates cardiac ischemia and impaired relaxation in IR through the inhibition of low grade inflammation and the angiotensin system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28350577>Reliability of heart rate as neuroadrenergic marker in the metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome is characterized by a pronounced sympathetic overactivity as documented by the marked increase in muscle sympathetic nerve traffic (MSNA) as well as in plasma norepinephrine values reported in this condition. Whether and to what extent heart rate (HR) reflects the abovementioned adrenergic alterations in metabolic syndrome remains largely undefined. It is also undefined the validity of the abovementioned adrenergic markers in reflecting the main features of the metabolic syndrome.In 65 metabolic syndrome patients, aged 56.5 ± 1.3 years (mean ± SEM), we measured over a 30-min resting period blood pressure, HR (ECG), venous plasma norepinephrine (HPLC) and MSNA (microneurography). We also evaluated anthropometric and metabolic variables including HOMA index, correlating them with the adrenergic markers. The same measurements were also made in 48 age-matched healthy controls.HR was significantly greater in the metabolic syndrome patients than in controls (74.6 ± 1.5 versus 67.5 ± 1.5 bpm, P < 0.001) and significantly and directly correlated with the elevated norepinephrine and MSNA values (r = 0.25 and 0.33, P < 0.05 and 0.01, respectively). MSNA was significantly and directly related to blood pressure (r = 0.27 and 0.31 SBP and DBP, respectively, P < 0.05 for both), BMI (r = 0.36, P < 0.01), waist circumference (r = 0.34, P < 0.01), waist-to-hip ratio (r = 0.49, P < 0.01) and plasma  (r = 0.57, P < 0.01). In contrast, no significant correlation was detectable between HR or norepinephrine and the abovementioned anthropometric and metabolic variables.Our data show that in the metabolic syndrome not only peripheral but also cardiac sympathetic drive is markedly potentiated and HR can be regarded as a marker of adrenergic overdrive characterizing this clinical condition. The reliability of HR (and of plasma norepinephrine) as sympathetic marker appears to be limited, however, this variable being unable to reflect, at variance from MSNA, the main metabolic and anthropometric abnormalities characterizing the metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29732238>Pharmacometabolomic signature links simvastatin therapy and .</a></h2><p>Statins, widely prescribed drugs for treatment of cardiovascular disease, inhibit the biosynthesis of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).

There are no reliable biomarkers for predicting clinical side effects in vulnerable individuals.

Altered beta cell function was observed in 53% of patients following simvastatin therapy and  was observed in 54% of patients. We identified initial signature of simvastatin-induced , including , hydroxylamine, hydroxycarbamate and isoleucine which, upon further replication and expansion, could be predictive biomarkers of individual susceptibility to simvastatin-induced new onset pre-type II diabetes mellitus. No patients were clinically diagnosed with T2DM.Within this short 6 weeks study, some patients became hyperglycemic and/or  resistant. Diabetic markers were associated with decarboxylated small aminated metabolites as well as a branched chain amino acid directly linked to glucose metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis.

Under normal conditions, the cardiomyocyte response to acute β-adrenergic stimulation partly depends on increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here we investigated the interplay between beta-adrenergic signaling, ROS and cardiac contractility using freshly isolated cardiomyocytes and whole hearts from two mouse models with the metabolic syndrome (high-fat diet and ob/ob mice). We hypothesized that cardiomyocytes of mice with the metabolic syndrome would experience excessive ROS levels that trigger cellular dysfunctions. Fluorescent dyes and confocal microscopy were used to assess mitochondrial ROS production, cellular Ca2+ handling and contractile function in freshly isolated adult cardiomyocytes. Immunofluorescence, western blot and enzyme assay were used to study protein biochemistry. Unexpectedly, our results point towards decreased cardiac ROS signaling in a stable, chronic phase of the metabolic syndrome because: β-adrenergic-induced increases in the amplitude of intracellular Ca2+ signals were insensitive to antioxidant treatment; mitochondrial ROS production showed decreased basal rate and smaller response to β-adrenergic stimulation. Moreover, control hearts and hearts with the metabolic syndrome showed similar basal levels of ROS-mediated protein modification, but only control hearts showed increases after β-adrenergic stimulation. In conclusion, in contrast to the situation in control hearts, the cardiomyocyte response to acute β-adrenergic stimulation does not involve increased mitochondrial ROS production in a stable, chronic phase of the metabolic syndrome. This can be seen as a beneficial adaptation to prevent excessive ROS levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25919405>Similar magnitude of post-exercise hyperglycemia despite manipulating  exercise intensity in type 1 diabetes individuals.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to compare the glycemic and glucoregulatory hormone responses to low- and moderate-intensity morning  exercise (RE) sessions in type 1 diabetes (T1DM).

Reclassification of patients was investigated according to continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI >0).After median (25th to 75th percentile) follow-up of 7.5 (6.4-8.7) years, 233 patients (6.4%) were registered with incident type 2 diabetes. In models adjusted for age, sex, and fasting status, plasma betaine was inversely related to new-onset disease [odds ratio (OR) per 1 SD, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62-0.83; P < 0.00001], whereas positive associations were observed for urine betaine (1.25; 1.09-1.43; P = 0.001), dimethylglycine (1.22; 1.06-1.40; P = 0.007), and sarcosine (1.30; 1.13-1.49; P < 0.001).

Sustained βAR stimulation also attenuated GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane, whereas short-term stimulation had no effect. In HBSM cells, prolonged treatment with β-agonists had no effect on -induced glucose uptake and did not alter -induced expressions of GLUT1, GLUT4, and GLUT10. In addition, genetic polymorphisms at amino acid positions 16 and 27 of βAR are linked to  by significant suppression of GLUT4 translocation compared to wild-type.

The results of this work showed a rise in the content of monounsaturated fatty acids (18:1 n-9) and a reduction in the level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (20:4 n-6) in plasma of rats with experimental IR. These findings are accompanied by the increased TNFα production and significant changes in plasma lipoprotein profile of rats with the fat overload. Particularly, a decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level and increased low-density (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol level were detected. The NSE administration to obese rats with IR restored the content of mono- and polyunsaturated FFA, increased HDL cholesterol content and reduced LDL cholesterol level. In addition, the IR rats treated with NSE showed normalization in the serum TNFα level. Our results showed the restoration of plasma lipid profile under NSE administration in rats with obesity-induced IR.

The persistence of β-cells decades after the onset of the disease indicates that the  of individual cells to the autoimmune insult is heterogeneous and might depend on the metabolic status of a cell at a given moment. The aim of this study is to investigate whether activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nACh-Rs) could increase β-cell  against the adverse environment prevailing at the onset of T1DM. Here, we show that nACh-R activation by nicotine and choline, 2 agonists of the receptor, decreases murine and human β-cell apoptosis induced by proinflammatory cytokines known to be present in the islet environment at the onset of T1DM. The protective mechanism activated by nicotine and choline involves attenuation of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization via modulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress, of the activity of B-cell lymphoma 2 family proteins and cytoplasmic calcium levels. Local inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress being key determinants of β-cell death in T1DM, we conclude that pharmacological activation of nACh-R could represent a valuable therapeutic option in the modulation of β-cell death in T1DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29201273>Proinflammatory Cytokines Are Soluble Mediators Linked with Ventricular Arrhythmias and Contractile Dysfunction in a Rat Model of Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome (MS) increases cardiovascular risk and is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias, although the precise mechanisms are still under study.

Heart function ex vivo in MS group showed a decreased mechanical performance response to isoproterenol challenge (ISO). Importantly, MS hearts under ISO showed nearly twofold the incidence of ventricular fibrillation. Healthy rat cardiomyocytes exposed to MS group serum displayed impaired contractile function and Ca handling during ISO treatment, showing slightly decreased cell shortening and Ca transient amplitude (23%), slower cytosolic calcium removal (17%), and more frequent spontaneous Ca release events (7.5-fold).

Male Wistar Kyoto rats were exposed to air or 0.25ppm or 1.00ppm ozone, 5h/day, 3 consecutive days/week (wk) for 13wks. Pulmonary, metabolic,  signaling and stress endpoints were determined immediately after 13wk or following a 1wk recovery period (13wk+1wk recovery). We show that episodic ozone exposure is associated with persistent pulmonary injury and inflammation, fasting hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, as well as, elevated circulating adrenaline and cholesterol when measured at 13wk, however, these responses were largely reversible following a 1wk recovery. Moreover, the increases noted acutely after ozone exposure in non-esterified fatty acids and branched chain amino acid levels were not apparent following a subchronic exposure. Neither peripheral or tissue specific  nor increased hepatic gluconeogenesis were present after subchronic ozone exposure. Instead, long-term ozone exposure lowered circulating  and severely impaired glucose-stimulated beta-cell  secretion. Thus, our findings in young-adult rats provide potential insights into epidemiological studies that show a positive association between ozone exposures and type 1 diabetes.

The present experiment tested the hypothesis that excess caloric intake alters this ability of epinephrine to increase blood glucose.Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a high-energy cafeteria-style diet (HED). Weight gain during the first 5 days on the diet was used to divide the rats into an HED-lean group and HED-obese group. After 9 weeks, the rats were injected with epinephrine, and blood glucose was measured.HED-obese rats gained body and fat mass, and developed  (IR) and hepatic steatosis. HED-lean and control rats did not differ. Epinephrine produced larger increases in blood glucose in the HED-obese rats than in the HED-lean and control rats. Removing the high-energy components of the diet for 4 weeks reversed the potentiated effects of epinephrine on glucose and corrected the IR but not the steatosis or obesity.Consumption of a high-energy cafeteria diet potentiates epinephrine-induced hyperglycemia.

Increases in the tumor necrosis factor α level in the plasma, the number of CD68+ macrophages and the free nuclear factor-κB level in gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) resulted in local inflammation, which appeared as inflamed dysfunctional gWAT. Reduced superoxide dismutases (SODs) deteriorate natural antioxidant defense systems and induce reactive oxygen species in gWAT. Dysregulation of plasma levels of catecholamine, adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipin in cholesterol-induced inflamed adipose tissue contributed to increased lipolysis and increased circulating nonesterified fatty acids. Cholesterol activated inflammation, lipolysis and cell death in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, Chol-3T3-CM reduced the population of M2-type Raw264.7 macrophages, indicating that the macrophage polarization is mediated by cholesterol. Together, our findings indicate that inflamed dysfunctional adipocytes are critical in NMS, supporting the development of anti-inflammatory agents as potential therapeutic drugs for treating NMS.© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26827989>Obesity-induced p53 activation in -dependent and independent tissues is inhibited by beta-adrenergic agonist in diet-induced obese rats.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to assay the role of beta-adrenergic receptor signaling in the regulation of obesity-induced p53 in high fat feeding obese rats.The role of beta-adrenergic receptor/cyclic AMP in the regulation of p53 and its downstream mediators was evaluated by western blot and real-time quantitative RT-PCR among diet induced rats.Beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol, and an adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin, at a single dose significantly reduced  consistent with a decrease in total and phospho-p53 levels in  and non- metabolic target tissues. The decrease of p53 signaling was consistent with the elevation of AKT and subsequent activation. Obese rats exposed to fasting also exhibited improvement in  action despite a slight effect on p53 level.Results of the present study obviously showed that beta-adrenergic receptor agonist/cAMP prevented obesity-induced p53 activation.

In addition, associations of several metabolic complications like , obesity, dyslipidemia and psychological co-morbidities are well known in PCOS. One of the major factors influencing mood and the emotional state of mind is neurotransmitters. Also, these neurotransmitters are very crucial for GnRH release. Hence, the current study investigates the status of neurotransmitters in PCOS.A PCOS rat model was developed using testosterone. Twenty-one-day-old rats were subcutaneously injected with 10 mg/kg body weight of testosterone propionate (TP) for 35 days. The animals were validated for PCOS characteristics by monitoring estrus cyclicity, serum testosterone and estradiol levels and by histological examination of ovarian sections. Neurotransmitter estimation was carried out using fluorometric and spectrophotometric methods.TP-treated animals demonstrated increased serum testosterone levels with unaltered estradiol content, disturbed estrus cyclicity and many peripheral cysts in the ovary compared to control rats mimicking human PCOS. Norepinephrine (NE), dopamine, serotonin, γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) and epinephrine levels were significantly low in TP-induced PCOS rats compared to control ones, whereas the activity of acetylcholinesterase in the PCOS brain was markedly elevated.Neurotransmitter alteration could be one of the reasons for disturbed gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release, consequently directing the ovarian dysfunction in PCOS. Also, decrease in neurotransmitters, mainly NE, serotonin and dopamine (DA) attributes to mood disorders like depression and anxiety in PCOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27124282>Possible Increase in Serum FABP4 Level Despite Adiposity Reduction by Canagliflozin, an SGLT2 Inhibitor.</a></h2><p>Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4/A-FABP/aP2) is secreted from adipocytes in association with catecholamine-induced lipolysis, and elevated serum FABP4 level is associated with obesity,  and atherosclerosis. Secreted FABP4 as a novel adipokine leads to  via increased hepatic glucose production (HGP). Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors decrease blood glucose level via increased urinary glucose excretion, though HGP is enhanced. Here we investigated whether canagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, modulates serum FABP4 level.Canagliflozin (100 mg/day) was administered to type 2 diabetic patients (n = 39) for 12 weeks. Serum FABP4 level was measured before and after treatment.At baseline, serum FABP4 level was correlated with adiposity, renal dysfunction and noradrenaline level. Treatment with canagliflozin significantly decreased adiposity and levels of fasting glucose and HbA1c but increased average serum FABP4 level by 10.3% (18.0 ± 1.0 vs. 19.8 ± 1.2 ng/ml, P = 0.008), though elevation of FABP4 level after treatment was observed in 26 (66.7%) out of 39 patients. Change in FABP4 level was positively correlated with change in levels of fasting glucose (r = 0.329, P = 0.044), HbA1c (r = 0.329, P = 0.044) and noradrenaline (r = 0.329, P = 0.041) but was not significantly correlated with change in adiposity or other variables.Canagliflozin paradoxically increases serum FABP4 level in some diabetic patients despite amelioration of glucose metabolism and adiposity reduction, possibly via induction of catecholamine-induced lipolysis in adipocytes. Increased FABP4 level by canagliflozin may undermine the improvement of glucose metabolism and might be a possible mechanism of increased HGP by inhibition of SGLT2.UMIN-CTR Clinical Trial UMIN000018151.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29127233>Vascular endothelial function masks increased sympathetic vasopressor activity in rats with metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Sympathetic hyperactivation, a common feature of obesity and metabolic syndrome, is a key trigger of hypertension. However, some obese subjects with autonomic imbalance present a dissociation between sympathetic activity-mediated vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Here, we aimed to determine in a rat model of metabolic syndrome whether the endothelium endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS)-NO pathway contributes to counteract the vasopressor effect of the sympathetic system. Rats were fed a high-fat and high-sucrose (HFS) diet for 15 wk. Sympathovagal balance was evaluated by spectral analysis of heart rate variability and plasmatic catecholamine measurements. Blood pressure was measured in the presence or absence of N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) to inhibit the contribution of eNOS. Vascular reactivity was assessed on isolated aortic rings in response to α-adrenergic agonist. The HFS diet increased sympathetic tone, which is characterized by a higher low on the high-frequency spectral power ratio and a higher plasmatic concentration of epinephrine. Despite this, no change in blood pressure was observed. Interestingly, HFS rats exhibited vascular hyporeactivity (-23.6%) to α-adrenergic receptor stimulation that was abolished by endothelial removal or eNOS inhibition (l-NAME). In addition, eNOS phosphorylation (Ser) was increased in response to phenylephrine in HFS rats only. Accordingly, eNOS inhibition in vivo revealed higher blood pressure in HFS rats compared with control rats (147 vs. 126 mmHg for mean blood pressure, respectively). Restrain of adrenergic vasopressor action by endothelium eNOS is increased in HFS rats and contributes to maintained blood pressure in the physiological range. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Despite the fact that prohypertensive sympathetic nervous system activity is markedly increased in rats with early metabolic syndrome, they present with normal blood pressure. These observations appear to be explained by increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase response to adrenergic stimulation, which results in vascular hyporeactivity to α-adrenergic stimulation, and therefore blood pressure is preserved in the physiological range.

Several studies have reported negative effects of LAN on health and behavior in humans and nonhuman animals. Exposure of non-diabetic mice to dim LAN impairs glucose tolerance, whereas a return to dark nights (LD) reverses this impairment. We predicted that exposure to LAN would exacerbate the metabolic abnormalities in TALLYHO/JngJ (TH) mice, a polygenic model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).We exposed 7-week old male TH mice to either LD or LAN for 8-10 weeks in two separate experiments. After 8 weeks of light treatment, we conducted intraperitoneal glucose tolerance testing (ipGTT) followed by intraperitoneal  tolerance testing (ipITT). In Experiment 1, all mice were returned to LD for 4 weeks, and ipITT was repeated.The major results of this study are i) LAN exposure for 8 weeks exacerbates glucose intolerance and  ii) the effects of LAN on  are reversed upon return to LD, iii) LAN exposure results in a greater increase in body weight compared to LD exposure, iv) LAN increases the incidence of mice developing overt T2DM, and v) LAN exposure decreases survival of mice with T2DM.In conclusion, LAN exacerbated metabolic abnormalities in a polygenic mouse model of T2DM, and these effects were reversed upon return to dark nights. The applicability of these findings to humans with T2DM needs to be determined.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Pcyt2 mice either received no treatment or were allowed access to 2 mg/mL choline in drinking water for 4 weeks. Skeletal muscle was harvested from choline treated and untreated mice. Lipid analysis and metabolic gene expression and signaling pathways were compared between untreated Pcyt2 mice, treated Pcyt2 mice, and Pcyt2 mice. The major positive effect of choline supplementation on IR muscle was the reduction of glucose utilization for FA and triglyceride (TAG) synthesis and increased muscle glucose storage as glycogen. Choline reduced the expression of genes for FA and TAG formation (Scd1, Fas, Srebp1c, Dgat1/2), upregulated the genes for FA oxidation (Cpt1, Pparα, Pgc1α), and had minor effects on phospholipid and lipolysis genes. Pcyt2 muscle had reduced  signaling (IRS1), autophagy (LC3), and choline transport (CTL1) proteins that were restored by choline treatment. Additionally, choline activated AMPK and Akt while inhibiting mTORC1 phosphorylation. These data established that choline supplementation could restore muscle glucose metabolism by reducing lipogenesis and improving mitochondrial and intracellular signaling for protein and energy metabolism in  resistant Pcyt2 deficient mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29935920>Profiling plasma N-Acylethanolamine levels and their ratios as a biomarker of obesity and dysmetabolism.</a></h2><p>N-acylethanolamines play different roles in energy balance; anandamide (AEA) stimulates energy intake and storage, N-palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) counters inflammation, and N-oleoylethanolamide (OEA) mediates anorectic signals and lipid oxidation. Inconsistencies in the association of plasma N-acylethanolamines with human obesity and cardiometabolic risk have emerged among previous studies, possibly caused by heterogeneous cohorts and designs, and by unstandardized N-acylethanolamine measurements. We aimed to characterize changes in the plasma profile, including N-acylethanolamine levels and ratios associated with obesity, menopause in women, and ageing in men, and to define the significance of such a profile as a biomarker for metabolic imbalance.Adult, drug-free women (n = 103 premenopausal and n = 81 menopausal) and men (n = 144) were stratified according to the body mass index (BMI) into normal weight (NW; BMI: 18.5-24.9 kg/m), overweight (OW; BMI: 25.0-29.9 kg/m), and obese (OB; BMI ≥30.0 kg/m). Anthropometric and metabolic parameters were determined. Validated blood processing and analytical procedures for N-acylethanolamine measurements were used. We investigated the effect of BMI and menopause in women, and BMI and age in men, as well as the BMI-independent influence of metabolic parameters on the N-acylethanolamine profile.BMI and waist circumference directly associated with AEA in women and men, and with PEA in premenopausal women and in men, while BMI directly associated with OEA in premenopausal women and in men. BMI, in both genders, and waist circumference, in women only, inversely associated with PEA/AEA and OEA/AEA. Menopause increased N-acylethanolamine levels, whereas ageing resulted in increasing OEA relative abundance in men. AEA and OEA abundances in premenopausal, and PEA and OEA abundances in lean menopausal women, were directly associated with hypertension. Conversely, PEA and OEA abundances lowered with hypertension in elderly men.  was associated with changes in N-acylethanolamine ratios specific for premenopausal (reduced PEA/AEA and OEA/AEA), menopausal (reduced OEA/AEA) women and men (reduced OEA/AEA and OEA/PEA). PEA and OEA levels increased with total cholesterol, and OEA abundance specifically increased with HDL-cholesterol. Elevated triglyceride levels were associated with increased N-acylethanolamine levels only in menopausal women.Obesity-related N-acylethanolamine hypertone is characterized by imbalanced N-acylethanolamine ratios. The profile given by a combination of N-acylethanolamine absolute levels and ratios enables imbalances to be identified in relationship with different metabolic parameters, with specific relevance according to gender, menopause and age, representing a useful means for monitoring metabolic health. Finally, N-acylethanolamine system appears a promising target for intervention strategies.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Allelic variants in coding genes for this system components may contribute to differences in the susceptibility to obesity and related health hazards. These data have mostly been shown in Caucasian populations and in severely obese individuals. We investigated a multiethnic Brazilian population to study the relationships among the polymorphism 385C>A in an endocannabinoid degrading enzyme gene (FAAH), endocannabinoid levels and markers of cardiometabolic risk. Fasting plasma levels of endocannabinoids and congeners (anandamide, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, N-oleoylethanolamide and N-palmitoylethanolamide) were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in 200 apparently healthy individuals of both genders with body mass indices from 22.5 ± 1.8 to 35.9 ± 5.5 kg/m2 (mean ± 1 SD) and ages between 18 and 60 years. All were evaluated for anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, metabolic variables, homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA-IR), adiponectin, leptin, C-reactive protein, and genotyping. The endocannabinoid levels increased as a function of obesity and . The homozygous genotype AA was associated with higher levels of anandamide and lower levels of adiponectin versus wild homozygous CC and heterozygotes combined. The levels of anandamide were independent and positively associated with the genotype AA position 385 of FAAH, C-reactive protein levels and body mass index. Our findings provide evidence for an endocannabinoid-related phenotype that may be identified by the combination of circulating anandamide levels with genotyping of the FAAH 385C>A; this phenotype is not exclusive to mono-ethnoracial populations nor to individuals with severe obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27778639>Hyperinsulinemia and  in Dopamine β-Hydroxylase Deficiency.</a></h2><p>Dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) deficiency is a rare genetic disorder characterized by failure to convert dopamine to norepinephrine. DBH-deficient patients lack sympathetic adrenergic function and are therefore predisposed to orthostatic hypotension. DBH-deficient mice exhibit hyperinsulinemia, lower plasma glucose levels, and  due to loss of tonic sympathetic inhibition of  secretion. The impact of DBH deficiency on glucose homeostasis in humans is unknown.We describe the metabolic profile of an adolescent female DBH-deficient patient. The patient underwent genetic testing, cardiovascular autonomic function testing, and evaluation of  secretion and sensitivity with hyperglycemic clamp under treatment-naive conditions. All procedures were repeated after 1 year of treatment with the norepinephrine prodrug droxidopa (300 mg, 3 times a day). Genetic testing showed a homozygous mutation in the DBH gene (rs74853476). Under treatment-naive conditions, she had undetectable plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels, resulting in sympathetic noradrenergic failure and orthostatic hypotension (-32 mm Hg supine to seated). She had high adiposity (41%) and fasting plasma  levels (25 μU/mL), with normal glucose (91 mg/dL). Hyperglycemic clamp revealed increased glucose-stimulated  secretion and . Droxidopa restored plasma norepinephrine and improved orthostatic tolerance, with modest effects on glucose homeostasis.We provide evidence for impairment in cardiovascular autonomic regulation, hyperinsulinemia, enhanced glucose-stimulated  secretion, and  in a DBH-deficient patient. These metabolic derangements were not corrected by chronic droxidopa treatment. These findings provide insight into the pathophysiology and treatment of DBH deficiency and into the importance of catecholaminergic mechanisms to resting metabolism.ClinicalTrials.gov .Copyright © 2017 by the Endocrine Society</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25260611>Endogenous leptin contributes to baroreflex suppression within the solitary tract nucleus of aged rats.</a></h2><p>The decline in cardiovagal baroreflex function that occurs with aging is accompanied by an increase in circulating leptin levels. Our previous studies showed that exogenous leptin impairs the baroreflex sensitivity for control of heart rate in younger rats, but the contribution of this hormone to baroreflex dysfunction during aging is unknown. Thus we assessed the effect of bilateral leptin microinjection (500 fmol/60 nl) within the solitary tract nucleus (NTS) on the baroreflex sensitivity in older (66 ± 2 wk of age) urethane/chloralose anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats with elevated circulating leptin levels. In contrast to the 63% reduction observed in younger rats, leptin did not alter the baroreflex sensitivity for bradycardia evoked by phenylephrine in older rats (0.76 ± 0.19 baseline vs. 0.71 ± 0.15 ms/mmHg after leptin; P = 0.806). We hypothesized that this loss of sensitivity reflected endogenous suppression of the baroreflex by elevated leptin, rather than cardiovascular  to the peptide. Indeed, NTS administration of a leptin receptor antagonist (75 pmol/120 nl) improved the baroreflex sensitivity for bradycardia in older rats (0.73 ± 0.13 baseline vs. 1.19 ± 0.26 at 10 min vs. 1.87 ± 0.32 at 60 min vs. 1.22 ± 0.54 ms/mmHg at 120 min; P = 0.002), with no effect in younger rats. There was no effect of the leptin antagonist on the baroreflex sensitivity for tachycardia, responses to cardiac vagal chemosensitive fiber activation, or resting hemodynamics in older rats. These findings suggest that the actions of endogenous leptin within the NTS, either produced locally or derived from the circulation, contribute to baroreflex suppression during aging.Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27591221>Arterial baroreflex control of sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate in patients with type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>Despite greater blood pressure reactivity to acute cardiovascular stressors and a higher prevalence of hypertension in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, limited information is available regarding arterial baroreflex (ABR) control in T2D. We hypothesized that ABR control of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and heart rate (HR) are attenuated in T2D patients. Seventeen T2D patients (50 ± 2 yr; 31 ± 1 kg/m), 9 weight-matched controls (WM-CON, 46 ± 2 yr; 32 ± 2 kg/m) and 10 lean controls (Lean-CON, 49 ± 3 yr; 23 ± 1 kg/m), underwent bolus infusions of sodium nitroprusside (100 μg) followed 60 s later by phenylephrine (150 μg) and weighted linear regression performed. No group differences in overall sympathetic baroreflex gain were observed (T2D: -2.5 ± 0.3 vs. WM-CON: -2.6 ± 0.2 vs. Lean-CON: -2.7 ± 0.4 arbitrary units·beat·mmHg, P > 0.05) or in sympathetic baroreflex gain when derived separately during blood pressure (BP) falls (nitroprusside) and BP rises (phenylephrine). In contrast, overall cardiac baroreflex gain was reduced in T2D patients compared with Lean-CON (T2D: 8.2 ± 1.5 vs. Lean-CON: 15.6 ± 2.9 ms·mmHg, P < 0.05) and also tended to be reduced in WM-CON (9.3 ± 1.9 ms·mmHg) compared with Lean-CON (P = 0.059). Likewise, during BP rises, cardiac baroreflex gain was reduced in T2D patients and weight-matched controls compared with lean controls (P < 0.05), whereas no group differences were found during BP falls (P > 0.05). Sympathetic and cardiac ABR gains were comparable between normotensive and hypertensive T2D patients (P > 0.05). These findings suggest preserved ABR control of MSNA in T2D patients compared with both obese and lean age-matched counterparts, with a selective impairment in ABR HR control in T2D that may be related to obesity.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25543537>The suppression of ghrelin signaling mitigates age‐associated  thermogenic impairment.</a></h2><p>Aging is associated with severe thermogenic impairment, which contributes to obesity and diabetes in aging. We previously reported that ablation of the ghrelin receptor, growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS‐R), attenuates age‐associated obesity and . Ghrelin and obestatin are derived from the same preproghrelin gene. Here we showed that in brown adipocytes, ghrelin decreases the expression of thermogenic regulator but obestatin increases it, thus showing the opposite effects. We also found that during aging, plasma ghrelin and GHS‐R expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT) are increased, but plasma obestatin is unchanged. Increased plasma ghrelin and unchanged obestatin during aging may lead to an imbalance of thermogenic regulation, which may in turn exacerbate thermogenic impairment in aging. Moreover, we found that GHS‐R ablation activates thermogenic signaling, enhances  activation, increases mitochondrial biogenesis, and improves mitochondrial dynamics of BAT. In addition, we detected increased norepinephrine in the circulation, and observed that GHS‐R knockdown in brown adipocytes directly stimulates thermogenic activity, suggesting that GHS‐R regulates thermogenesis via both central and peripheral mechanisms.Collectively, our studies demonstrate that ghrelin signaling is an important thermogenic regulator in aging. Antagonists of GHS‐R may serve as unique anti‐obesity agents, combating obesity by activating thermogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26831124>Differential effects of enalapril-felodipine versus enalapril-lercanidipine combination drug treatment on sympathetic nerve traffic and metabolic profile in obesity-related hypertension.</a></h2><p>Scanty information is available on the effects of combination drug treatment based on an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker on the neurometabolic alterations characterizing obesity-related hypertension (OHT). After 2-week run-in with enalapril (20 mg), 36 OHTs were randomized according to a double-blind crossover design to a combination therapy with either lercanidipine 10 mg (L) or felodipine extended release 5 mg (F), each lasting 8 weeks. Measurements included clinic and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and heart rate, homeostasis model assessment index, plasma norepinephrine, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity. Patients with uncontrolled BP were then uptitrated to 20 mg/d (L) and 10 mg/d (F) combined with enalapril 20 mg, respectively, for further 8 weeks. For similar BP reductions, enalapril-lercanidipine (EL) caused norepinephrine and MSNA increases significantly less pronounced than those seen with enalapril-felodipine, the lesser sympathoexcitation observed with EL being coupled with a significant improvement in homeostasis model assessment index. This was the case also when L and F were uptitrated in the combination.

Eight lactating dairy cows [244 ± 31 d in milk; 696 ± 63 kg of body weight (BW)] were blocked by breed and body condition score (3.2 ± 0.4) and randomly assigned to a sequence of 2 treatments in a crossover design. Treatments were 74-h continuous abomasal infusion of NA solution (3mg/h per kg of BW) as an antilipolytic agent to decrease plasma NEFA concentrations or the same volume of water (200 mL/h), concomitant with partial feed restriction. From 0 to 74 h of each experimental period, cows were feed-restricted to 33% of the ad libitum intake recorded during the prior 5 d. An ivGTT (0.25 g/kg of BW of glucose i.v.) and an ivBAC (4 nmol/kg of BW of isoproterenol hydrochloride, i.v.) were performed at 48 and 72 h, respectively. Intake was 24.1, 8.2, 8.0, and 8.0 kg of dry matter/d before restriction, on d 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Nicotinic acid decreased plasma NEFA and increased  and glucose concentrations during feed restriction. Nicotinic acid also led to greater glucose and  response areas under the curve during ivGTT [glucose: 6,562 vs. 5,056 (mg/dL) × 180 min; : 6,042 vs. 2,502 (µIU/mL) × 180 min] and ivBAC [glucose: 535 vs. 240 (mg/dL) × 120 min; : 1,283 vs. 222 (µIU/mL) × 120 min], and enhanced NEFA area under the curve during ivBAC [45,521 vs. 22,862 (µEq/L) × 120 min]. Milk, fat, and protein yields (29.1, 1.2, and 0.93 kg on d -2, respectively) decreased to 17.9, 0.81, and 0.56 kg for control, and 11.5, 0.54, and 0.39 kg for NA on d 3, respectively. Nicotinic acid may have decreased production by inhibiting the supply of NEFA for energy and milk fat synthesis. Milk urea nitrogen was increased by NA on d 2 (12.8 vs. 19.1mg/dL) and d 3 (11.6 vs. 17.8 mg/dL), probably due to a greater reliance on mobilized amino acids. Somatic cell count was increased by NA on d 3 (187 vs. 848 × 1,000 cells/mL). Patterns of glucose and  concentration observed during 74 h of NA infusion reflect a state of , which contrasts with shorter-term responses in nonlactating cows.

Glucose and fatty acid uptake and the corresponding transporters Glut4 and Cd36 are similarly impaired in male and female Pcyt2(+/-) hearts. These mice also have similarly reduced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt1 signaling and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the heart. However, only Pcyt2(+/-) males develop hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. Pcyt2(+/-) males have upregulated heart AceI expression, heart phospholipids enriched in arachidonic acid and other n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and dramatically increased ROS production in the aorta. In contrast, Pcyt2(+/-) females have unmodified heart phospholipids but have reduced heart triglyceride levels and altered expression of the structural genes Acta (low) and Myh7 (high). These changes together protect Pcyt2(+/-) females from cardiac dysfunction under conditions of reduced glucose and fatty acid uptake and heart . Our data identify Pcyt2 and membrane PE biogenesis as important determinants of gender-specific differences in cardiac lipids and heart function.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

We hypothesise that this paradox could be inferred to modulation of the "endocannabinoid" system on systemic and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) inflammation. We designed a translational project including clinical and in vitro studies at Geneva University Hospital. Morbid obese subjects (n=11) were submitted to gastric bypass surgery (GBS) and followed up for one year (post-GBS).  and circulating and SAT levels of endocannabinoids, adipocytokines and CC chemokines were assessed pre- and post-GBS and compared to a control group of normal and overweight subjects (CTL) (n=20). In vitro cultures with 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used to validate findings from clinical results. Morbid obese subjects had baseline lower  sensitivity and higher hs-CRP, leptin, CCL5 and anandamide (AEA) levels as compared to CTL. GBS induced a massive weight and fat mass loss, improved  sensitivity and lipid profile, decreased C-reactive protein, leptin, and CCL2 levels. In SAT, increased expression of resistin, CCL2, CCL5 and tumour necrosis factor and reduced MGLL were shown in morbid obese patients pre-GBS when compared to CTL. GBS increased all endocannabinoids and reduced adipocytokines and CC chemokines. In morbid obese SAT, inverse correlations independent of body mass index were shown between palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and N-oleoylethanolamide (OEA) levels and inflammatory molecules. In vitro, OEA inhibited CCL2 secretion from adipocytes via ERK1/2 activation. In conclusion, GBS was associated with relevant clinical, metabolic and inflammatory improvements, increasing endocannabinoid levels in SAT. OEA directly reduced CCL2 secretion via ERK1/2 activation in adipocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27923787>Type of supplemented simple sugar, not merely calorie intake, determines adverse effects on metabolism and aortic function in female rats.</a></h2><p>High consumption of simple sugars causes adverse cardiometabolic effects. We investigated the mechanisms underlying the metabolic and vascular effects of glucose or fructose intake and determined whether these effects are exclusively related to increased calorie consumption. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were supplemented with 20% wt/vol glucose or fructose for 2 mo, and plasma analytes and aortic response to vasodilator and vasoconstrictor agents were determined. Expression of molecules associated with lipid metabolism,  signaling, and vascular response were evaluated in hepatic and/or aortic tissues. Caloric intake was increased in both sugar-supplemented groups vs. control and in glucose- vs. fructose-supplemented rats. Hepatic lipogenesis was induced in both groups. Plasma triglycerides were increased only in the fructose group, together with decreased expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A and increased microsomal triglyceride transfer protein expression in the liver. Plasma adiponectin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α expression was increased only by glucose supplementation.  signaling in liver and aorta was impaired in both sugar-supplemented groups, but the effect was more pronounced in the fructose group. Fructose supplementation attenuated aortic relaxation response to a nitric oxide (NO) donor, whereas glucose potentiated it. Phenylephrine-induced maximal contractions were reduced in the glucose group, which could be related to increased endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation and subsequent elevated basal NO in the glucose group. In conclusion, despite higher caloric intake in glucose-supplemented rats, fructose caused worse metabolic and vascular responses. This may be because of the elevated adiponectin level and the subsequent enhancement of PPARα and eNOS phosphorylation in glucose-supplemented rats.This is the first study comparing the effects of glucose and fructose consumption on metabolic factors and aortic function in female rats. Our results show that, although total caloric consumption was higher in glucose-supplemented rats, fructose ingestion had a greater impact in inducing metabolic and aortic dysfunction.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28213613>ATF4/ATG5 Signaling in Hypothalamic Proopiomelanocortin Neurons Regulates Fat Mass via Affecting Energy Expenditure.</a></h2><p>Although many biological functions of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) have been identified, a role of hypothalamic ATF4 in the regulation of energy homeostasis is poorly understood. In this study, we showed that hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neuron-specific ATF4 knockout (PAKO) mice are lean and have higher energy expenditure. Furthermore, PAKO mice were resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity, glucose intolerance, and leptin . Moreover, the expression of autophagy protein 5 (ATG5) was increased or decreased by ATF4 knockdown or overexpression, respectively, and ATF4 inhibited the transcription of ATG5 by binding to the basic zipper-containing protein sites on its promoter. Importantly, mice with double knockout of ATF4 and ATG5 in POMC neurons gained more fat mass and reduced energy expenditure compared with PAKO mice under a high-fat diet. Finally, the effect of ATF4 deletion in POMC neurons was possibly mediated via enhanced ATG5-dependent autophagy and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone production in the hypothalamus. Taken together, these results identify the beneficial role of hypothalamic ATF4/ATG5 axis in the regulation of energy expenditure, obesity, and obesity-related metabolic disorders, which suggests that ATF4/ATG5 axis in the hypothalamus may be a new potential therapeutic target for treating obesity and obesity-related metabolic diseases.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29860500>Intralipid/Heparin Infusion Alters Brain Metabolites Assessed With 1H-MRS Spectroscopy in Young Healthy Men.</a></h2><p>We previously demonstrated that  infusion altered metabolite concentrations in cerebral tissues assessed with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in young subjects with high  sensitivity, but not in those with low  sensitivity. Fat overload is an important factor leading to .The purpose of the current study was to examine the effect of elevated circulating free fatty acid (FFA) levels on metabolites in cerebral tissues assessed with 1H-MRS.The study group comprised 10 young, healthy male subjects. 1H-MRS was performed at baseline and after 4-hour Intralipid (Fresenius Kabi)/heparin or saline infusions administered in random order. Voxels were positioned in the left frontal lobe, left temporal lobe, and hippocampus. The ratios of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho)-containing compounds, myo-inositol (mI), and glutamate/glutamine/γ-aminobutyric acid complex (Glx) to creatine (Cr) and nonsuppressed water signal were determined.Intralipid/heparin infusion resulted in a significant increase in circulating FFAs (P < 0.0001). Significant changes in brain neurometabolite concentrations in response to Intralipid/heparin infusion were increases in frontal mI/Cr (P = 0.041) and mI/H2O (P = 0.037), decreases in frontal and hippocampal Glx/Cr (P = 0.018 and P = 0.015, respectively) and Glx/H2O (P = 0.03 and P = 0.067, respectively), and a decrease in hippocampal NAA/Cr (P = 0.007) and NAA/H2O (P = 0.019). No changes in neurometabolites were observed during the saline infusion.Acute circulating FFA elevation influenced cerebral metabolites in healthy humans and lipid-induced  could be partly responsible for these effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27119311>Cardioprotective effect of pioglitazone in diabetic and non-diabetic rats subjected to acute myocardial infarction involves suppression of AGE-RAGE axis and inhibition of apoptosis.</a></h2><p> increases risk of cardiovascular diseases. This work investigated the protective effect of pioglitazone on myocardial infarction (MI) in non-diabetic and diabetic rats, focusing on its role on advanced glycated endproducts (AGEs) and cardiac apoptotic machinery. Male rats were divided into 2 experiments: experiment I and II (non-diabetic and diabetic rats) were assigned as saline, MI (isoproterenol, 85 mg/kg, daily), and MI+pioglitazone (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg). Injection of isoproterenol in diabetic rats produced greater ECG disturbances compared to non-diabetic rats. Treatment with pioglitazone (5 mg/kg) reduced the infarct size and improved some ECG findings. Pioglitazone (10 mg/kg) enhanced ECG findings, improved the histopathological picture and downregulated apoptosis in cardiac tissues. Whereas the higher dose of pioglitazone (20 mg/kg) did not improve most of the measured parameters but rather worsened some of them, such as proapoptotic markers. Importantly, a positive correlation was found between serum AGEs and cardiac AGE receptors (RAGEs) versus caspase 3 expression in the two experiments. Therefore, the current effect of pioglitazone was, at least in part, mediated through downregulation of AGE-RAGE axis and inhibition of apoptosis. Consequently, these data suggest that pioglitazone, at optimized doses, may have utility in protection from acute MI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26525534>Phosphoproteomics Identifies CK2 as a Negative Regulator of Beige Adipocyte Thermogenesis and Energy Expenditure.</a></h2><p>Catecholamines promote lipolysis both in brown and white adipocytes, whereas the same stimuli preferentially activate thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. Molecular mechanisms for the adipose-selective activation of thermogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we employed quantitative phosphoproteomics to map global and temporal phosphorylation profiles in brown, beige, and white adipocytes under β3-adrenenoceptor activation and identified kinases responsible for the adipose-selective phosphorylation profiles. We found that casein kinase2 (CK2) activity is preferentially higher in white adipocytes than brown/beige adipocytes. Genetic or pharmacological blockade of CK2 in white adipocytes activates the thermogenic program in response to cAMP stimuli. Such activation is largely through reduced CK2-mediated phosphorylation of class I HDACs. Notably, inhibition of CK2 promotes beige adipocyte biogenesis and leads to an increase in whole-body energy expenditure and ameliorates diet-induced obesity and . These results indicate that CK2 is a plausible target to rewire the β3-adrenenoceptor signaling cascade that promotes thermogenesis in adipocytes.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Metabolomics represents a powerful approach to study global metabolic changes in response to environmental exposures. We therefore conducted this study to investigate changes in serum metabolites in response to the reduction of PM exposure among healthy college students.We conducted a randomized, double-blind crossover trial in 55 healthy college students in Shanghai, China. Real and sham air purifiers were placed in participants' dormitories in random order for 9 days with a 12-day washout period. Serum metabolites were quantified by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Between-treatment differences in metabolites were examined using orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis and mixed-effect models. Secondary outcomes include blood pressure, corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, , and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation.The average personal exposure to PMs with aerodynamic diameters ≤2.5 μm was 24.3 μg/m during the real purification and 53.1 μg/m during the sham purification. Metabolomics analysis showed that higher exposure to PMs with aerodynamic diameters ≤2.5 μm led to significant increases in cortisol, cortisone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Between-treatment differences were also observed for glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, and lipids. We found significantly higher blood pressure, hormones, , and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation among individuals exposed to higher PMs with aerodynamic diameters ≤2.5 μm.This study suggests that higher PM may induce metabolic alterations that are consistent with activations of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axes, adding potential mechanistic insights into the adverse health outcomes associated with PM. Furthermore, our study demonstrated short-term reductions in stress hormone following indoor air purification.URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

The mechanisms by which the obesity leads cardiac dysfunction are not fully elucidated and few studies have evaluated the relationship between obesity and proteins involved in myocardial β-adrenergic (βA) system. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cardiac function and βA pathway components in myocardium of obese rats. Male Wistar rats were distributed into two groups: control (n = 17; standard diet) and obese (n = 17; saturated high-fat diet) fed for 33 weeks. Nutritional profile and comorbidities were assessed. Cardiac structure and function was evaluated by macroscopic postmortem, echocardiographic and isolated papillary muscle analyzes. Myocardial protein expression of β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors, Gαs protein, adenylate cyclase (AC) and protein kinase A (PKA) was performed by Western blot. Cardiac cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and PKA activity were assessed by ELISA Obese rats showed increased adiposity index (P < 0.001) and several comorbidities as hypertension, glucose intolerance, , and dyslipidemia compared with control rats. Echocardiographic assessment revealed increased left atrium diameter (C: 4.98 ± 0.38 vs. Ob: 5.47 ± 0.53, P = 0.024) and posterior wall shortening velocity (C: 37.1 ± 3.6 vs. Ob: 41.8 ± 3.8, P = 0.007) in obese group. Papillary muscle evaluation indicated that baseline data and myocardial responsiveness to isoproterenol stimulation were similar between the groups. Protein expression of myocardial AC was higher in obese group than in the control (C: 1.00 ± 0.21 vs. Ob: 1.25 ± 0.10, P = 0.025), whereas the other components were unchanged. These results suggest that saturated high-fat diet-induced obesity was not effective in triggering cardiac dysfunction and impair the beta-adrenergic signaling.© 2016 The Authors.

Little is known regarding the relationship between ISO treatment, the induced chromium (Cr) redistribution, and changes in glucose metabolism. We aimed to characterize the effects of a single dose of ISO on glucose homeostasis and Cr level changes in an obesity mouse model.Mice (C57BL6/j strain) were first fed for a continuous period of 12 weeks with either a high fat diet (HFD), to develop an obesity animal model, or a standard diet (SD), to develop a lean animal model as controls. These groups were each separated into two subgroups to receive either a single dose of ISO or saline (control). We measured in vivo their metabolic parameters, fasting glucose level, area under the curve (AUC) for glucose level time profile,  level time profile,  sensitivity index, and chromium distribution.After a single dose of ISO, the SD-fed mice had slightly higher blood glucose levels compared with the SD controls, when the level was measured 30 and 60min after injection. By contrast, the ISO-treated HFD-fed mice had significantly higher blood glucose levels and AUC during the entire 120min following one administration compared with the HFD control group. Additionally, they had a substantially lower HOMA-IR index, whereas  levels remained unchanged. The Cr level in their bones and liver was decreased, and loss of Cr through urinary excretion was elevated.The results demonstrated that ISO exacerbated hyperglycemic syndrome in the obesity animal model. ISO induced a net negative Cr balance as a result of increased urinary excretion, leading to Cr mobilization that was not desirable to overcome the hyperglycemia.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

We aimed to elucidate the potential contribution of the renal sympathetic nervous system to glucose metabolism during the development of type 2 diabetes.Uninephrectomised diabetic Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats underwent RDX at 25 weeks of age and were followed up to 46 weeks of age.RDX decreased plasma and renal tissue noradrenaline (norepinephrine) levels and BP. RDX also improved glucose metabolism and  sensitivity, which was associated with increased in vivo glucose uptake by peripheral tissues. Furthermore, RDX suppressed overexpression of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (Sglt2 [also known as Slc5a2]) in renal tissues, which was followed by an augmentation of glycosuria in type 2 diabetic OLETF rats. Similar improvements in glucose metabolism after RDX were observed in young OLETF rats at the prediabetic stage (21 weeks of age) without changing BP.Here, we propose the new concept of a connection between renal glucose metabolism and the renal sympathetic nervous system during the development of type 2 diabetes. Our data demonstrate that RDX exerts beneficial effects on glucose metabolism by an increase in tissue glucose uptake and glycosuria induced by Sglt2 suppression. These data have provided a new insight not only into the treatment of hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, but also the pathophysiology of  manifested by sympathetic hyperactivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29138472>Functional characterization of the Ucp1-associated oxidative phenotype of human epicardial adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Brown fat presence and metabolic activity has been associated with lower body mass index, higher  sensitivity and better cardiometabolic profile in humans. We, and others, have previously reported the presence of Ucp1, a marker of brown adipocytes, in human epicardial adipose tissue (eAT). Characterization of the metabolic activity and associated physiological relevance of Ucp1 within eAT, however, is still awaited. Here, we validate the presence of Ucp1 within human eAT and its 'beige' nature. Using in-vitro analytical approaches, we further characterize its thermogenic potential and demonstrate that human eAT is capable of undergoing enhanced uncoupling respiration upon stimulation. Direct biopsy gene expression analysis reveals a negative association between thermogenic markers and oxidative stress-related genes in this depot. Consistently, isoproterenol (Iso) stimulation of eAT leads to a downregulation of secreted proteins included in the GO terms 'cell redox homeostasis' and 'protein folding'. In addition, cardiac endothelial cells exhibit a downregulation in the expression of adhesion markers upon treatment with Iso-stimulated eAT derived conditioned media. Overall, these observations suggest that Ucp1- associated metabolic activity plays a significant role in local tissue homeostasis within eAT and can plausibly alter its communication with neighboring cells of the cardiovascular system.</p></html>
