<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9480835>Calcium ions potentiate lipoxygenase activity of cytochrome c at the physiological pH.</a></h2><p>Cytochrome c oxidized linoleic acid, with lipoxygenase-like activity, to 9-hydroperoxy-10,12-octadecadienoic acid (9-HpODE),  (), 13-keto-9,11-octadecadienoic acid (13-KODE), and hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoic acids (HEPOs) in the presence of calcium chloride at the physiological pH of 7.5. In the absence of calcium, the reaction was remarkably reduced. Statistically significant increase of 13-KODE was observed 1 min after the reaction was started by adding calcium. Calcium chloride at concentrations as low as 30 microM caused statistically significant increase of 13-KODE production in the presence of 1 microM cytochrome c, and cytochrome c at concentrations as low as 10 nM caused statistically significant increase of 13-KODE production in the presence of 2 mM calcium. The addition of bleomycin enhanced the reaction, and the addition of adriamycin attenuated the reaction. The same oxidized linoleic acid products were found in the submitochondrial particles which were hydrolyzed by phospholipase-A2 in the presence of calcium. Lipoxygenase activity potentiated by calcium may be involved in the  peroxidation in the submitochondrial particles hydrolyzed by phospholipase-A2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17848084>Lipoxygenase distribution in coffee (Coffea arabica L.) berries.</a></h2><p>In this paper lipoxygenase (LOX) presence was investigated in coffee berries to determine its involvement in lipid degradative metabolism of plants grown in organic and conventional cultivations. An immunochemical analysis has evidenced a ca. 80 kDa protein, cross-reacting with an anti-LOX antibody, only in the pulp fraction of berries obtained from plants of both cultivations. LOX activity in this fraction could be monitored either as conjugated diene formation or reaction products (determined by HPLC) and was mainly associated with a heavy membrane fraction (HMF, enriched in tonoplast, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and ) and a light membrane fraction (LMF, enriched in plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum, with low levels of tonoplast and ). The LOX activity of LMF from berries of both cultivations showed an optimum at pH 8.0. The HMF exhibited a different activity peak in samples from conventional (pH 8.0) and organic (pH 5.5) cultures, suggesting the presence of different isoenzymes. These findings were also confirmed by variation of the ratio of 9- and 13-hydroperoxides in organic (1:1) and conventional cultivations (1:10), indicating that the organic one was subjected to an oxidative stress in the coffee pulp fraction leading to the expression of an acidic LOX. Such de novo synthesized LOX activity could be responsible for the production of secondary metabolites, which may interfere with the organoleptic profile of coffee.</p></html>
