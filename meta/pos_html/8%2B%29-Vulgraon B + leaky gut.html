This study was carried out to delineate the expression of the activation markers CD38 and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR on CD4+ and CD8+ peripheral blood lymphocytes in ME/CFS.Proportions and absolute numbers of peripheral lymphocytes expressing CD3+, CD19+, CD4+, CD8+, CD38+ and HLA-DR+ were measured in ME/CFS (n=139), chronic fatigue (CF, n=65) and normal controls (n=40).The proportions of CD3+, CD8+, CD8+CD38+ and CD8+HLA-DR+ were significantly higher in ME/CFS patients than controls, while CD38+, CD8+CD38+, CD8+HLA-DR+ and CD38+HLA-DR+ were significantly higher in ME/CFS than CF. The percentage of CD19+ cells and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio were significantly lower in ME/CFS and CF than in controls. There were highly significant inverse correlations between the increased expression of CD38+, especially that of CD8+CD38+, and the lowered CD4+/CD8+ ratio and CD19+ expression. There were no significant associations between the flow cytometric results and severity or duration of illness and peripheral blood biomarkers of oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS, i.e. IgM responses to O&N modified epitopes),   (IgM or IgA responses to LPS of  commensal bacteria), cytokines (interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-α), neopterin, lysozyme and autoimmune responses to serotonin.The results support that a) increased CD38 and HLA-DR expression on CD8+ T cells are biomarkers of ME/CFS; ) increased CD38 antigen expression may contribute to suppression of the CD4+/CD8+ ratio and CD19+ expression; c) there are different immune subgroups of ME/CFS patients, e.g. increased CD8+ activation marker expression versus inflammation or O&NS processes; and d) viral infections or reactivation may play a role in a some ME/CFS patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726793>Expression of Toll-Like Receptors in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and response to cognitive-behavioral therapy in major depressive disorder.</a></h2><p>In recent years, increased attention has been paid to the inflammatory mechanisms of major depressive disorder (MDD). The aim of the present study was to investigate pro-inflammatory pathways related to the " " hypothesis of MDD, which is based on the putative intestinal translocation of Gram-negative bacteria and a subsequent abnormal immune response mediated by the Toll-Like Receptor-4 (TLR-4) pathway. 50 patients with first-episode MDD and 30 healthy control subjects participated in the study. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to measure TLR-4 and TLR-2 RNA from peripheral mononuclear blood cells, as well as the expression of NF-κβ, a key transcription factor of the pro-inflammatory response. TLR-4 protein expression was determined by using flow cytometry. TLR-2 served as a control molecule. Low-grade inflammation was characterized by the measurement of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Bacterial translocation was investigated by the measurement of the 16S rRNA subunit (16S rDNA) of intestinal microbiota in the blood plasma of the participants. We performed these analyses before (t1) and after (t2) cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in MDD. The healthy control subjects were also assessed two times. We found significantly elevated expressions of all three markers (TLR-4 RNA and protein, NF-κβ RNA) and 16S rDNA in MDD at t1 relative to healthy control subjects. These markers showed a significant decrease during CBT (t1>t2 in MDD). We observed no between-group differences and changes in the case of TLR-2. Greater reduction of pro-inflammatory markers during CBT was associated with more pronounced clinical improvement. IL-6 and CRP displayed a moderately elevated level in MDD and did not change during CBT. In conclusion, TLR-4 signaling is up-regulated in newly diagnosed patients with MDD, which may be related to bacterial translocation or to the presence of various damage-associated molecular patterns. Clinical improvement during psychotherapy is associated with decreased expression of pro-inflammatory markers.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The evidence suggests that this pathogenic -brain circuit involves: (i) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the GI-tract resident enterotoxigenic Gram-negative bacteria Bacteroides fragilis (BF-LPS); (ii) LPS transit across the GI-tract barrier into the systemic circulation; (iii) transport of a highly pro-inflammatory systemic BF-LPS across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into the brain-parenchyma and neuronal-cytoplasm; (iv) activation and signaling via the pro-inflammatory NF-kB (p50/p65) transcription-factor complex; (v) NF-kB-coupling and significant up-regulation of the inducible pro-inflammatory microRNA-146a (miRNA-146a) and microRNA-155 (miRNA-155); each containing multiple NF-kB DNA-binding and activation sites in their immediate promoters; and (vi) subsequent down-regulation of miRNA-146a-miRNA-155 regulated mRNA targets such as that encoding complement factor H (CFH), a soluble complement control glycoprotein and key repressor of the innate-immune response. Down-regulated CFH expression activates the complement-system, the major non-cellular component of the innate-immune system while propagating neuro-inflammation. Other GI-tract microbes and their highly complex pro-inflammatory exudates may contribute to this pathogenic GI-tract-brain pathway. We speculate that it may be significant that the first Gram-negative anaerobic bacterial species intensively studied as a potential contributor to the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), that being the bacillus Bacteroides fragilis appears to utilize damaged or  physiological barriers and an activated NF-kB (p50-p65) - pro-inflammatory miRNA-146a-miRNA-155 signaling circuit to convey microbiome-derived pathogenic signals into the brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31323278>Upregulation of the nitrosylome in bipolar disorder type 1 (BP1) and major depression, but not BP2: Increased IgM antibodies to nitrosylated conjugates are associated with indicants of  .</a></h2><p>Major depression (MDD) and a lifetime history of MDD are characterized by increased nitrosylation, while bipolar disorder type 1 (BP1), but not BP2, is accompanied by highly increased levels of oxidative stress and nitric oxide (NO) production. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether nitrosylation is involved in BP and whether there are differences in nitrosylation between BP1 and BP2.Serum IgM antibodies directed against nitroso (NO)-adducts were examined in MDD, BP1, BP2 and healthy controls, namely IgM responses to NO-cysteine, NO-tryptophan (NOW), NO-arginine and NO-albumin (SBA) in association with IgA/IgM responses to LPS of Gram-negative bacteria, IgG responses to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and serum peroxides.Serum IgM levels against NO adducts were significantly higher in BP1 and MDD as compared with healthy controls, whereas BP2 patients occupied an intermediate position. IgM responses to NO-albumin were significantly higher in BP1 and MDD than in BP2 patients. There were highly significant associations between the IgM responses to NO-adducts and IgG responses to ox-LDL and IgA/IgM responses to Gram-negative bacteria.BP1 and MDD are characterized by an upregulation of the nitrosylome (the proteome of nitrosylated proteins) and increased IgM responses to nitrosylated conjugates. Increased nitrosylation may be driven by increased bacterial translocation and is associated with lipid peroxidation processes. Innate-like (B1 and marginal zone)  cells and increased nitrosylation may play a key role in the major affective disorders through activation of immune-inflammatory and oxidative pathways, cardiovascular comorbidity and impairments in antioxidant defenses, neuro-glial interactions, synaptic plasticity, neuroprotection, neurogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Major factors associated with increased  permeability, including  dysbiosis and yeast overgrowth, use of NSAIDs and alcohol, food hypersensitivities (IgE-mediated), food intolerances (IgG-mediated), small bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), systemic inflammation, psychosocial stressors, some infections (e.g., HIV) and dietary patterns, should be assessed. Stool samples can be used to assay  dysbiosis,  inflammation and decreased mucosal defenses using assays of fecal growth of bacteria, yeast and fungi and stool assays of calprotectin, secretory IgA, β-defensin, α- antitrypsin, lysozyme and lactoferrin.

The aim of this study was to replicate these findings in a larger study group of depressed patients and to examine the associations between the IgA and IgM responses to  commensals and staging of depression as well as the fatigue and somatic (F&S) symptoms of depression.We measured serum concentrations of IgM and IgA against the LPS of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. Hafnia alvei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas putida, Citrobacter koseri, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 112 depressed patients and 28 normal controls. The severity of F&S symptoms was measured using the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Rating Scale.The prevalences and median values of serum IgM and IgA against LPS of these commensals were significantly higher in depressed patients than in controls. The IgM levels directed against the LPS of these commensal bacteria were significantly higher in patients with chronic depression than in those without. The immune responses directed against LPS were not associated with melancholia or recurrent depression. There was a significant correlation between the IgA response directed against LPS and gastro-intestinal symptoms.The results indicate that increased bacterial translocation with immune responses to the LPS of commensal bacteria may play a role in the pathophysiology of depression, particularly chronic depression. Bacterial translocation may a) occur secondary to systemic inflammation in depression and intensify and perpetuate the primary inflammatory response once the commensals are translocated; or ) be a primary trigger factor associated with the onset of depression in some vulnerable individuals. The findings suggest that "translocated"  commensal bacteria activate immune cells to elicit IgA and IgM responses and that this phenomenon may play a role in the pathophysiology of (chronic) depression by causing progressive amplifications of immune pathways.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier .V.

We assayed, in plasma, IgA responses to 6 Gram-negative bacteria, i.e. Hafnei alvei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas putida and Citrobacter pylori, progesterone and oestradiol at days 7, 14, 21 and 28 of the menstrual cycle.Significant changes in Δ (actual minus one week earlier) IgA to LPS of the 6 Gram-negative bacteria during the menstrual cycle were observed with peak IgA levels at T4 (day 28) and lows at T1 or T2 (day 7 or 14). The Δ IgA changes in H. alvei, M. Morganii, P. putida during the menstrual cycle were significantly and positively associated with changes in the total DRSP score, and severity of physio-somatic, anxiety and breast-craving, but not depressive, symptoms. The changes in IgA responses to LPS were largely predicted by changes in progesterone and steady-state levels of progesterone averaged over the luteal phase.Menstrual cycle-associated changes in IgA directed against LPS and by inference bacterial translocation may be driven by effects of progesterone on transcellular, paracellular and vascular pathways ( ) thereby contributing to the severity of physio-somatic and anxiety symptoms as well as fatigue, breast swelling and food cravings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26727422>A dysbiotic subpopulation of alcohol-dependent subjects.</a></h2><p>The vast majority of studies that assessed the importance of biological factors for the development of psychiatric disorders focused on processes occurring at the brain level. Alcohol-dependence is a very frequent psychiatric disorder where psycho-pharmacological interventions are only of moderate efficacy. Our laboratory has recently described that a subpopulation of alcohol-dependent subjects, that accounted for approximately 40% of individuals tested, presented with an increased intestinal permeability, with a dysbiosis, with alterations in the metabolomic content of faeces--that could play a role in the increased permeability--and finally with a more severe profile of alcohol-dependence than the other non-dysbiotic subpopulation. In this addendum, we discuss the implications of our observations for the pathophysiology of alcohol dependence where we try to discriminate which addiction dimensions are likely related to the  microbiota alterations and whether these alterations are the cause or the consequence of drinking habits.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23660503>Role for intestinal CYP2E1 in alcohol-induced circadian gene-mediated intestinal hyperpermeability.</a></h2><p>We have shown that alcohol increases Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cell monolayer permeability in vitro by inducing the expression of redox-sensitive circadian clock proteins CLOCK and PER2 and that these proteins are necessary for alcohol-induced hyperpermeability. We hypothesized that alcohol metabolism by intestinal Cytochrome P450 isoform 2E1 (CYP2E1) could alter circadian gene expression (Clock and Per2), resulting in alcohol-induced hyperpermeability. In vitro Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells were exposed to alcohol, and CYP2E1 protein, activity, and mRNA were measured. CYP2E1 expression was knocked down via siRNA and alcohol-induced hyperpermeability, and CLOCK and PER2 protein expression were measured. Caco-2 cells were also treated with alcohol or H₂O₂ with or without N-acetylcysteine (NAC) anti-oxidant, and CLOCK and PER2 proteins were measured at 4 or 2 h. In vivo Cyp2e1 protein and mRNA were also measured in colon tissue from alcohol-fed mice. Alcohol increased CYP2E1 protein by 93% and enzyme activity by 69% in intestinal cells in vitro. Alcohol feeding also increased mouse colonic Cyp2e1 protein by 73%. mRNA levels of Cyp2e1 were not changed by alcohol in vitro or in mouse intestine. siRNA knockdown of CYP2E1 in Caco-2 cells prevented alcohol-induced hyperpermeability and induction of CLOCK and PER2 proteins. Alcohol-induced and H₂O₂-induced increases in intestinal cell CLOCK and PER2 were significantly inhibited by treatment with NAC. We concluded that our data support a novel role for intestinal CYP2E1 in alcohol-induced intestinal hyperpermeability via a mechanism involving CYP2E1-dependent induction of oxidative stress and upregulation of circadian clock proteins CLOCK and PER2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25838982>Claudin-2 as a mediator of   barrier during intestinal inflammation.</a></h2><p>The epithelial tight junction determines the paracellular water and ion movement in the intestine and also prevents uptake of larger molecules, including antigens, in an uncontrolled manner. Claudin-2, one of the 27 mammalian claudins regulating that barrier function, forms a paracellular channel for small cations and water. It is typically expressed in  epithelia like proximal nephron and small intestine and provides a major pathway for the paracellular transport of sodium, potassium, and fluid. In intestinal inflammation (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), immune-mediated diseases (celiac disease), and infections (HIV enteropathy), claudin-2 is upregulated in small and large intestine and contributes to diarrhea via a leak flux mechanism. In parallel to that upregulation, other epithelial and tight junctional features are altered and the luminal uptake of antigenic macromolecules is enhanced, for which claudin-2 may be partially responsible through induction of tight junction strand discontinuities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30109601>Common Genetic Variants Link the Abnormalities in the -Brain Axis in Prematurity and Autism.</a></h2><p>This review considers a link between prematurity and autism by comparing symptoms, physiological abnormalities, and behavior. It focuses on the bidirectional signaling between the microbiota and the brain, here defined as the microbiota--vagus-heart-brain (MGVHB) axis and its systemic disruption accompanying altered neurodevelopment. Data derived from clinical and animal studies document increased prevalence of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms in both premature and autistic children and suggest an incomplete maturation of the -blood barrier resulting in a " ," dysbiosis, abnormalities in vagal regulation of the heart, altered development of specific brain regions, and behavior. Furthermore, this review posits the hypothesis that common genetic variants link the abnormalities in the MGVHB axis in premature and autistic pathologies. This hypothesis is based on the recently identified common genetic variants: early  cell factor 1 (EBF1), selenocysteine tRNA-specific eukaryotic elongation factor (EEFSEC), and angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AGTR2), in the maternal and infant DNA samples, associated with risk of preterm birth and independently implicated in a risk of autism. We predict that the AGTR2 variants involved in the brain maturation and oxytocin-arginine-vasopressin (OXT-AVP) pathways, related to social behavior, will contribute to our understanding of the link between prematurity and autism paving a way to new therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21407167>Depression's multiple comorbidities explained by (neuro)inflammatory and oxidative & nitrosative stress pathways.</a></h2><p>There is now evidence that depression, as characterized by melancholic symptoms, anxiety, and fatigue and somatic (F&S) symptoms, is the clinical expression of peripheral cell-mediated activation, inflammation and induction of oxidative and nitrosative stress (IO&NS) pathways and of central microglial activation, decreased neurogenesis and increased apoptosis. This review gives an explanation for the multiple "co-morbidities" between depression and a large variety of a) brain disorders related to neurodegeneration, e.g. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis and stroke; ) medical disorders, such as cardiovascular disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome,  , diabetes type 1 and 2, obesity and the metabolic syndrome, and HIV infection; and c) conditions, such as hemodialysis, interferon-α-based immunotherapy, the postnatal period and psychosocial stressors. The common denominator of all those disorders/conditions is the presence of microglial activation and/or activation of peripheral IO&NS pathways. There is evidence that shared peripheral and / or central IO&NS pathways underpin the pathophysiology of depression and the previously mentioned disorders and that activation of these IO&NS pathways contributes to shared risk. The IO&NS pathways function as a smoke sensor that detect threats in the peripheral and central parts of the body and signal these threats as melancholic, anxiety, and fatigue and somatic (F&S) symptoms. The presence of concomitant depression is strongly associated with a lower quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality in medical disorders. This may be explained since depression contributes to increased (neuro)inflammatory burden and may therefore drive the inflammatory and degenerative progression. It is concluded that the activation of peripheral and / or central IO&NS pathways may explain the co-occurrence of depression with the above disorders. This shows that depression belongs to the spectrum of inflammatory and degenerative disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25291130>Assessment of the capability of a gelling complex made of tara gum and the exopolysaccharides produced by the microorganism Streptococcus thermophilus ST10 to prospectively restore the  physiological barrier: a pilot study.</a></h2><p> , or intestinal permeability, is the phenomenon of the  wall exhibiting increased absorbency. It is pretty well recognised that an altered or damaged bowel lining or  wall may result from unbalanced diet, parasites, infection, or medications and that this allows substances such as toxins, microbes, undigested food, or waste to leak through. As a natural consequence, this prompts the body to initiate an immune reaction leading to potentially severe health conditions. Different strategies may be used to improve, at least temporarily, the physiological intestinal barrier. The use of specific beneficial microorganisms, such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, has been suggested as an innovative tool to counteract an improper level of intestinal permeability. The association of bacteria with specific gelling agents, such as gums, may represent an improvement since these molecules are able to form hydrophilic gels that distribute uniformly over the inner intestinal surface. This pilot study was undertaken to evaluate intestinal permeability in subjects treated with a gelling complex, an association of tara gum and the microorganism Streptococcus thermophilus ST10 (DSM 25246), which has a well-demonstrated in vitro ability to synthesise and secrete exopolysaccharides (EPSs).Twenty-five healthy subjects were enrolled in this human intervention, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial (age between 21 and 57 y, mean 37.7±11.2). Subjects were then randomised into 2 groups: group A (13 subjects) was given an active formulation containing 250 mg of tara gum and 1 billion viable cells of S. thermophilus ST10, whereas group  (12 subjects) was given a placebo formulation. All the subjects participating in the study were directed to take 1 dose per day for 30 consecutive days. The presence and concentration of exopolysaccharides (EPSs) in the faeces was determined at time 0 (d0), after 30 days of treatment (d30), and at the end of the 2-week follow-up period (d45). The monosaccharide composition of EPSs was used to quantify the possible contribution of tara gum to the amount of polysaccharides detected in the faecal material. Intestinal permeability was evaluated at the same time by means of the lactitol/mannitol ratio (small intestine permeability) and sucralose concentration (colonic permeability) in urine specimens sampled after specified times. A statistical comparison was made between the concentration of EPSs, the lactulose/mannitol ratio, and the amount of excreted sucralose in the 2 groups at d0, d30, and d45.In the active group, supplementation with S. thermophilus ST10 and tara gum was able to significantly increase the faecal EPSs concentration compared with placebo (from 0.169 mg/g to 0.633 mg/g after 30 d, P<0.001). An interesting decrease in intestinal permeability, both of the small bowel and in the colon, was also recorded. The L/M ratio diminished from 0.021 in the active group to 0.014 and 0.015 after 30 and 45 days, respectively (P=0.045 and P=0.033 compared with placebo). The sucralose concentration decreased from 35.8 mg to 27.9 mg and 29.1 mg (P=0.038 and P=0.026 compared with placebo) at the end of the supplementation period and after the follow-up, respectively. No significant differences were recorded in the placebo after 30 days or at the end of the follow-up.The association of the EPSs produced by S. thermophilus ST10 and tara gum seems capable of significantly improving the intestinal functional barrier in healthy subjects. A wider study in subjects presenting impaired  permeability would be useful in the future to confirm the positive results from this pilot trial. In any case, our findings are consistent with the parallel increase in exopolysaccharide concentration in the faecal material, thus suggesting the effective ability of the strain used to secrete EPSs in the  lumen. An innovative approach of this type may be useful in helping to restore the physiological barrier by means of a merely natural and mechanical action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30609922>Probiotics, prebiotics and amelioration of diseases.</a></h2><p>Dysbiosis of  microbiota is closely related to occurrence of many important chronic inflammations-related diseases. So far the traditionally prescribed prebiotics and probiotics do not show significant impact on amelioration of these diseases in general. Thus the development of next generation prebiotics and probiotics designed to target specific diseases is urgently needed. In this review, we first make a brief introduction on current understandings of normal  microbiota, microbiome, and their roles in homeostasis of mucosal immunity and  integrity. Then, under the situation of microbiota dysbiosis, development of chronic inflammations in the intestine occurs, leading to   situation and systematic chronic inflammation in the host. These subsequently resulted in development of many important diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, liver inflammations, and other diseases such as colorectal cancer (CRC), obesity-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD), the compromised lung immunity, and some on brain/neuro disorders. The strategy used to optimally implant the effective prebiotics, probiotics and the derived postbiotics for amelioration of the diseases is presented. While the effectiveness of these agents seems promising, additional studies are needed to establish recommendations for most clinical settings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28738753>Genetic predictors of celiac disease, lactose intolerance, and vitamin D function and presence of peptide morphins in urine of children with neurodevelopmental disorders.</a></h2><p>Gastrointestinal disturbances, nutritional deficiencies, and food intolerances are frequently observed in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). To reveal possible association of celiac disease risk variants (HLA-DQ), lactose intolerance associated variant (LCT-13910C>T) as well as variant associated with vitamin D function (VDR FokI) with NDD, polymerase chain reaction-based methodology was used. Additionally, intestinal peptide permeability was estimated in NDD patients and healthy children by measuring the level of peptides in urine using high-performance liquid chromatography. Levels of opioid peptides, casomorphin 8, and gluten exorphin C were significantly elevated in urine samples of NDD patients (P = 0.004 and P = 0.005, respectively), but no association of genetic risk variants for celiac disease and lactose intolerance with NDD was found. Our results indicate that increased intestinal peptide permeability observed in analyzed NDD patients is not associated with genetic predictors of celiac disease or lactose intolerance. We have also found that FF genotype of VDR FokI and lower serum levels of vitamin D (25-OH) showed association with childhood autism (CHA), a subgroup of NDD. We hypothesize that vitamin D might be important for the development of CHA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11602653>Preventing  leakiness by oats supplementation ameliorates alcohol-induced liver damage in rats.</a></h2><p>Only 30% of alcoholics develop liver disease (ALD) suggesting that additional factors are needed. Endotoxin is one such factor, but its etiology is unclear. Since the  is the main source of endotoxin, we sought to determine whether an increase in intestinal permeability ( ) is required for alcohol-induced endotoxemia and liver injury and whether the  leakiness is preventable. For 10 weeks, rats received by gavage increasing alcohol doses (to 8 g/kg/day) and either oats (10 g/kg) or chow .i.d. Intestinal permeability was then assessed by urinary excretion of lactulose and mannitol. Liver injury was evaluated histologically, biochemically (liver fat content), and by serum aminotransferase. Alcohol caused  leakiness that was associated with both endotoxemia and liver injury. Oats prevented these changes. We conclude that chronic gavage of alcohol in rats is a simple experimental model that mimics key aspects of ALD, including endotoxemia and liver injury, and can be useful to study possible mechanisms of endotoxemia in ALD. Since preventing the  leakiness by oats also prevented the endotoxemia and ameliorated liver damage in rat, our results suggest that alcohol-induced  leakiness 1) may cause alcohol-induced endotoxemia and liver injury and 2) may be the critical cofactor in the 30% of alcoholics who develop ALD. Further studies are needed to determine whether ALD in humans can be prevented by preventing alcohol-induced  leakiness, studies that should lead to the development of useful therapeutic agents for the prevention of ALD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20038921>Why myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) may kill you: disorders in the inflammatory and oxidative and nitrosative stress (IO&NS) pathways may explain cardiovascular disorders in ME/CFS.</a></h2><p>There is evidence that disorders in inflammatory and oxidative and nitrosative (IO&NS) pathways and a lowered antioxidant status are important pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Important precipitating and perpetuating factors for ME/CFS are (amongst others) bacterial and viral infections; bacterial translocation due to an increased  permeability; and psychological stress. Recently, Jason et al (2006) reported that the mean age of patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome dying from heart failure, i.e. 58.7 years, is significantly lower than the age of those dying from heart failure in the general US population, i.e. 83.1 years. These findings implicate that ME/CFS is a risk factor to cardio-vascular disorder. This review demonstrates that disorders in various IO&NS pathways provide explanations for the earlier mortality due to cardiovascular disorders in ME/CFS. These pathways are: a) chronic low grade inflammation with extended production of nuclear factor kappa  and COX-2 and increased levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha; ) increased O&NS with increased peroxide levels, and phospholipid oxidation including oxidative damage to phosphatidylinositol; c) decreased levels of specific antioxidants, i.e. coenzyme Q10, zinc and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate; d) bacterial translocation as a result of  ; e) decreased omega-3 polyunsatutared fatty acids (PUFAs), and increased omega-6 PUFA and saturated fatty acid levels; and f) the presence of viral and bacterial infections and psychological stressors. The mechanisms whereby each of these factors may contribute towards cardio-vascular disorder in ME/CFS are discussed. ME/CFS is a multisystemic metabolic-inflammatory disorder. The aberrations in IO&NS pathways may increase the risk for cardiovascular disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28400259>A role for the peripheral immune system in the development of alcohol use disorders?</a></h2><p>Preclinical studies have largely supported that alcohol-consumption induces the development of an important neuro-inflammation and this neuro-inflammation contributes to alcohol-drinking behaviors, notably through TLR4 and LPS related mechanisms. The neuro-inflammation originates from a direct interaction of ethanol with the neuronal and immune brain cells, but also from the generation of an inflammation at the periphery. Ethanol in particular interacts with the intestine to develop a  dysbiosis and an increase in  permeability, that allows the liberation of bacterial fragments to the systemic circulation and induces a pro-inflammatory response in the systemic circulation and peripheral organs, and in particular the liver. Peripheral cytokines or activated peripheral cells may cross the blood-brain barrier and activate neuro-inflammation. In humans, peripheral inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis are related to symptoms of alcohol use disorders (AUD), such as depression, anxiety and alcohol-craving, However, the dysbiosis, could also participate in a different manner to the symptomatology of the addiction, possibly by interacting with the stress system, by interfering with the sleep processes and altering the abilities for social interactions.

These interactions are commonly referred to as the -kidney axis. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) leads to disturbances of the  ecosystem. Key features include the increase of protein fermentation at the expense of carbohydrate fermentation and a disrupted epithelial barrier. A disturbed  ecosystem may contribute to the high burden of cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD.

In addition, the   may contribute to immune- inflammatory activation and oxidative stress. This study investigated whether bacterial translocation is associated with perinatal depression and anxiety scores and with prenatal physio-somatic symptoms and immune-inflammatory biomarkers, including the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway.Data were collected in pregnant women at the end of term (T1) and 4-6 weeks after delivery (T2) as well as in non-pregnant controls. We examined the associations between serum IgM/IgA responses to Gram- at the end of term and depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale -EPDS) and anxiety (Spielberger's State Anxiety Inventory -STAI) symptoms.Levels of C-reactive protein, zinc, haptoglobin, hematocrit and IgA/IgM responses to 9 TRYCATs were also measured. No significant associations of the IgA/IgM responses to Gram- with prenatal depression and anxiety were observed. Increased IgA/IgM responses to Gram- predict higher levels of haptoglobin, hematocrit and TRYCATs, in particular quinolinic acid and the quinolinic acid / kynurenic acid ratio. IgA responses to Gram- were significantly lowered in pregnant women compared to age-matched non-pregnant women, while IgM responses were significantly elevated in participants with alcohol consumption. Physio-somatic symptoms at the end of term were significantly associated with IgM responses to Klebsiella pneumonia. Postnatal anxiety was significantly predicted by IgA responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Our findings suggest that pregnancy may protect against bacterial translocation, while alcohol use may increase bacterial translocation. The results suggest that end of term mucosa-derived immune responses to Gram- contribute to immune activation, physio-somatic symptoms at the end of term and postnatal anxiety.• Immune responses to Gram - Bacteria associate with physio-somatic symptoms in pregnancy. • IgA responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa predict anxiety symptoms after delivery. • Pregnancy may have a protective effect against bacterial translocation. • Alcohol use increases   and bacterial translocation.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25591964>Simultaneous gas-chromatographic urinary measurement of sugar probes to assess intestinal permeability: use of time course analysis to optimize its use to assess regional  permeability.</a></h2><p>Measurement of intestinal permeability is important in several diseases but currently several methods are employed. We sought to: (1) develop a new GC based method to measure urinary mannitol, lactulose and sucralose to assess regional and total  permeability; (2) analyze the kinetics of these sugars in the urine to determine which ratio is useful to represent intestinal permeability; and (3) determine whether age, gender, race and BMI impact these values.Subjects drank a cocktail of sucrose, lactulose, mannitol and sucralose and these sugars were measured in the urine at 5, 12 and 24h with gas chromatography.Urinary mannitol exhibited significantly different kinetics than lactulose and sucralose which were similar to each other and varied little over the 24h. No permeability differences were observed for renal function, age, race, sex, or BMI.Our data do not support the use of the widely used L/M ratio as an accurate estimate of intestinal permeability. Our data support the use of: the sucralose/lactulose (S/M) ratio to measure: small intestine permeability (first 5h); small and large intestine (first 12h), and total  permeability (24h).

The aim of the present study was to examine whether CFS and MDD are accompanied by an IgM-mediated immune response directed against nitro-serum bovine albumin (BSA), which is a neoepitope of BSA formed by damage caused by nitrosative stress.Toward this end, we examined serum IgM antibodies to nitro-BSA in 13 patients with CFS, 14 subjects with partial CFS, 16 patients with MDD and 11 normal controls.We found that the prevalence and mean values for the serum IgM levels directed against nitro-BSA were significantly greater in patients with partial CFS, CFS and MDD than in normal controls, and significantly greater in CFS than in those with partial CFS and MDD. We found significant and positive correlations between serum IgM levels directed against nitro-BSA and symptoms of the FibroFatigue scale, i.e. aches and pain and muscular tension. There was also a strong positive correlation between serum IgM titers directed against nitro-BSA and an index of increased  permeability (" "), i.e. serum IgM and IgA directed against LPS of different gram-negative enterobacteria.The abovementioned results indicate that both CFS and MDD are accompanied by a) an increased  permeability which has allowed an exaggerated passage of BSA through a compromised epithelial barrier; ) increased nitrosative stress which has induced damage to BSA; and c) an IgM-mediated immune response which is directed against the nitro-BSA neoepitopes.

The  or gastrointestinal tract is a major immune organ equipped with the largest pool of immune cells representing more than 70% of the entire immune system and the largest population of macrophages in the human body. The bidirectional communication between the brain and the  is commonly known as brain- or -brain axis. Stroke often leads to  dysmotility,  microbiota dysbiosis, "" ,  hemorrhage, and even -origin sepsis, which is often associated with poor prognosis. Emerging evidence suggests that  inflammatory and immune response plays a key role in the pathophysiology of stroke and may become a key therapeutic target for its treatment. Ischemic brain tissue produces damage-associated molecular patterns to initiate innate and adaptive immune response both locally and systemically through the specialized pattern-recognition receptors (e.g., toll-like receptors). After stroke, innate immune cells including neutrophils, microglia or macrophages, mast cells, innate lymphocytes (IL-17 secreting γδ T-cell), and natural killer T-cell respond within hours, followed by the adaptive immune response through activation of T and  lymphocytes. Subpopulations of T-cells can help or worsen ischemic brain injury. Pro-inflammatory Th1, Th17, and γδ T-cells are often associated with increased inflammatory damage, whereas regulatory T-cells are known to suppress postischemic inflammation by increasing the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Although known to play a key role, research in the  inflammatory and immune response after stroke is still in its initial stage. A better understanding of the  inflammatory and immune response after stroke may be important for the development of effective stroke therapies. The present review will discuss recent advances in the studies of the brain- axis after stroke, the key issues to be solved, and the future directions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17476358>A hypomorphic R229Q Rag2 mouse mutant recapitulates human Omenn syndrome.</a></h2><p>Rag enzymes are the main players in V(D)J recombination, the process responsible for rearrangement of TCR and Ig genes. Hypomorphic Rag mutations in humans, which maintain partial V(D)J activity, cause a peculiar SCID associated with autoimmune-like manifestations, Omenn syndrome (OS). Although a deficient ability to sustain thymopoiesis and to produce a diverse T and  cell repertoire explains the increased susceptibility to severe infections, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the spectrum of clinical and immunological features of OS remain poorly defined. In order to better define the molecular and cellular pathophysiology of OS, we generated a knockin murine model carrying the Rag2 R229Q mutation previously described in several patients with OS and  forms of SCID. These Rag2(R229Q/R229Q) mice showed oligoclonal T cells, absence of circulating  cells, and peripheral eosinophilia. In addition, activated T cells infiltrated  and skin, causing diarrhea, alopecia, and, in some cases, severe erythrodermia. These findings were associated with reduced thymic expression of Aire and markedly reduced numbers of naturally occurring Tregs and NKT lymphocytes. In conclusion, Rag2(R229Q/R229Q) mice mimicked most symptoms of human OS; our findings support the notion that impaired immune tolerance and defective immune regulation are involved in the pathophysiology of OS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25869282>The effects of the multispecies probiotic mixture Ecologic®Barrier on migraine: results of an open-label pilot study.</a></h2><p>Migraine prevalence is associated with gastrointestinal disorders. Possible underlying mechanisms could be increased  permeability and inflammation. Probiotics may decrease intestinal permeability as well as inflammation, and therefore may reduce the frequency and/or intensity of migraine attacks. Therefore we assessed feasibility, possible clinical efficacy, and adverse reactions of probiotic treatment in migraine patients. 29 migraine patients took 2 g/d of a probiotic food supplement (Ecologic(®)Barrier, 2.5×10(9) cfu/g) during 12 weeks. Participants recorded frequency and intensity of migraine in a headache diary and completed the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) and Henry Ford Hospital Headache Disability Inventory (HDI) at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Compliance was measured every 4 weeks by counting the remaining sachets with probiotics. The study was completed by 27/29 (93%) patients who took 95% of the supplements. Obstipation was reported by 4 patients during the first 2 weeks of treatment only. The mean±standard deviation (SD) number of migraine days/month decreased significantly from 6.7±2.4 at baseline to 5.1±2.2 (P=0.008) in week 5-8 and 5.2±2.4 in week 9-12 (P=0.001). The mean±SD intensity of migraine decreased significantly from 6.3±1.5 at baseline to 5.5±1.9 after treatment (P=0.005). The MIDAS score improved from 24.8±25.5 to 16.6±13.5 (P=0.031). However, the mean HDI did not change significantly. In conclusion, probiotics may decrease migraine supporting a possible role for the intestine in migraine management. Feasibility and lack of adverse reactions justify further placebo-controlled studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27607739>Dietary nitrite induces occludin nitration in the stomach.</a></h2><p>The clinical implications of the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway have been extensively studied in recent years. However, the physiological impact of bioactive nitrogen oxides produced from dietary nitrate has remained largely elusive. Here, we report a hitherto unrecognized nitrite-dependent nitrating pathway that targets tight junction proteins in the stomach. Inorganic nitrate, nitrite or saliva obtained after the consumption of lettuce were administered by oral gavage to Wistar rats. The enterosalivary circulation of nitrate was allowed to occur for 4 h after which the animals were euthanized and the stomach collected. Nitrated occludin was detected by immunoprecipitation in the gastric epithelium upon inorganic nitrite administration (p < .05) but was not observed in the case of inorganic nitrate or human saliva administration. This observation, along with differences in NO production rates from inorganic and salivary nitrite under simulated gastric conditions, suggests that competing reactions at acidic pH determine the production of nitrating agents (NO) or other, more stable, oxides. Accordingly, it is shown in vitro that salivary nitrite yields higher steady state concentrations of NO (0.37 ± 0.01 μM) than sodium nitrite (0.12 ± 0.03 μM). Dietary-dependent reactions involving the production of nitrogen oxides should be further investigated as, in the context of occludin nitration, the consumption of green leafy vegetables (with high nitrate content), if able to modulate  barrier function, may have important implications in the context of   disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25266952>The gastrointestinal tract microbiome, probiotics, and mood.</a></h2><p>Mental health is closely linked to physical health. Depression (e.g., major depression) is highly prevalent worldwide and a major cause of disability. In a subgroup with treatment-resistant depression, standard pharmacotherapy interventions provide small if any incremental improvement in patient outcomes and may also require the application of an alternate approach. Therefore, in addition to the standard pharmacotherapies prescribed, patients will also be advised on the benefits of psychological counseling, electroconvulsive therapy, and transcranial magnetic stimulation or increasing physical activity and reducing harmful substance consumption. Numerous nutraceuticals have a beneficial role in treatment-resistant depression and include, herbal medicines of which Hypericum perforatum is the best studied, omega-3 fatty acid preparations, S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine (SAMe), various mineral formulations (e.g., magnesium) and folate (singly or in combination with  group vitamins) are prescribed to a lesser extent. Furthermore, a largely neglected area of research activity has been the role of live probiotic cultures that contribute to repairing dysbiosis (a   barrier abnormality) in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). In this commentary, we build a hypothesis that in addition suggests that GIT metabolites that are elaborated by the microbiome cohort may provide novel and significant avenues for efficacious therapeutic interventions for mood disorders. We posit that the microbiome in the gastrointestinal tract is implicit as an important participant for the amelioration of adverse mood conditions via the diverse metabolic activities provided by live beneficial bacteria (probiotics) as an active adjuvant treatment. This activity is in part triggered by a controlled release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hence further questions the antioxidant/oxidative stress postulate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25242628>Immunization of cows with novel core glycolipid vaccine induces anti-endotoxin antibodies in bovine colostrum.</a></h2><p>Translocation of -derived Gram-negative bacterial (GNB) lipopolysaccharide (LPS, or endotoxin) is a source of systemic inflammation that exacerbates HIV, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases and malnutrition. The oral administration of bovine colostrum (BC) reduces endotoxemia in patients with impaired  barrier function. Consequently, BC enriched in antibodies to LPS may ameliorate endotoxemia-related morbidities. We developed a detoxified J5 LPS/group  meningococcal outer membrane protein (J5dLPS/OMP) vaccine that induces antibodies against a highly conserved core region of LPS and protects against heterologous GNB infection. We now examine the ability of this vaccine to elicit anti-core endotoxin antibodies in BC.Two cohorts of pregnant cows were immunized with this vaccine in combination with FICA (Cohort 1) or Emulsigen-D (Cohort 2) adjuvants. Antibody responses to the J5 core LPS antigen were measured in both serum and colostrum and compared to antibody levels elicited by a commercially available veterinary vaccine (J5 Bacterin) comprised of heat-killed Escherichia coli O111, J5 mutant bacteria, from which the J5 LPS was purified.The J5dLPS/OMP vaccine induced high titers of serum IgG antibody to J5 LPS in all seven cows. Both IgG and to a lesser extent IgA anti-J5 LPS antibodies were generated in the colostrum. The J5dLPS/OMP vaccine was significantly more immunogenic in mice than was the J5 Bacterin.

This BC enriched in anti-core LPS antibodies has the potential to reduce endotoxemia and ameliorate endotoxin-related systemic inflammation in patients with impaired  barrier function. Since this vaccine is significantly more immunogenic than the J5 Bacterin vaccine, this J5dLPS/OMP vaccine might prove to be more useful for veterinary indications as well.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Study objectives were to characterize biomarkers of inflammation during the transition period in healthy and clinically diagnosed ketotic cows. Cows were retrospectively categorized into one of two groups: healthy and clinically diagnosed ketotic. Two data sets were utilized; the first dataset (Study A) was obtained as a subset of cows (n=16) enrolled in a larger experiment conducted at the Iowa State University Dairy utilizing Holstein cows (8 healthy; 8 ketotic), and the second dataset (Study ; 22 healthy; 22 ketotic) was obtained from a commercial farm. For both experiments, blood samples were collected prior to and following calving. Ketotic cows in both studies had reduced milk production compared to healthy cows (P<0.01). Post-calving, ketotic cows had increased serum amyloid A (4.2 and 1.8 fold in studies A and , respectively; P=0.03 and P=0.04), haptoglobin (>6 fold and ~4 fold; P=0.04 and P=0.03), and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (66 and 45%; P<0.01 and P=0.02) compared with their healthy counterparts. Antepartum circulating LPS in ketotic cows was increased (2.3 fold; P=0.01) compared to healthy cows in Study . In summary, increased biomarkers of inflammation appear to be closely associated with ketosis in transition dairy cows.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Increasing evidence suggests that accelerated polyamine metabolism is associated with the pathophysiology of depression. Polyamines regulate stress responses, inflammation, and neuronal signaling in the central and enteric nervous system. Agmatine is a promising target of altered polyamine metabolism considering its unique ability to regulate intracellular polyamine content and neuroprotective effects. Areas covered: This review discusses the polyamine system and its relationship to the central and enteric nervous system, focusing on results from preclinical studies supporting the relationship between agmatine and the pathophysiology of depression. We also discussed the main mechanisms underlying the antidepressant and neuroprotective effects of agmatine. Expert opinion: Our review points out the possible relationship between polyamines and the pathophysiology of depression. It discusses the efficacy of agmatine in several models of depressive-like behaviour, and suggests that it may prove to be an efficacious adjunctive treatment in bipolar depression. Furthermore, it discusses a proposed pathway linking systemic inflammation, observed in a subset of bipolar disorder patients, to abnormal polyamine metabolism and associated changes in the epithelial  barrier and blood-brain barrier.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30413188>Microbiota dysbiosis and barrier dysfunction in inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancers: exploring a common ground hypothesis.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a multifactorial disease which arises as a result of the interaction of genetic, environmental, barrier and microbial factors leading to chronic inflammation in the intestine. Patients with IBD had a higher risk of developing colorectal carcinoma (CRC), of which the subset was classified as colitis-associated cancers. Genetic polymorphism of innate immune receptors had long been considered a major risk factor for IBD, and the mutations were also recently observed in CRC. Altered microbial composition (termed microbiota dybiosis) and dysfunctional  barrier manifested by epithelial hyperpermeability and high amount of mucosa-associated bacteria were observed in IBD and CRC patients. The findings suggested that aberrant immune responses to penetrating commensal microbes may play key roles in fueling disease progression. Accumulative evidence demonstrated that mucosa-associated bacteria harbored colitogenic and protumoral properties in experimental models, supporting an active role of bacteria as pathobionts (commensal-derived opportunistic pathogens). Nevertheless, the host factors involved in bacterial dysbiosis and conversion mechanisms from lumen-dwelling commensals to mucosal pathobionts remain unclear. Based on the observation of  leakiness in patients and the evidence of epithelial hyperpermeability prior to the onset of mucosal histopathology in colitic animals, it was postulated that the epithelial barrier dysfunction associated with mucosal enrichment of specific bacterial strains may predispose the shift to disease-associated microbiota. The speculation of   as an initiating factor for microbiota dysbiosis that eventually led to pathological consequences was proposed as the "common ground hypothesis", which will be highlighted in this review. Overall, the understanding of the core interplay between  microbiota and epithelial barriers at early subclinical phases will shed light to novel therapeutic strategies to manage chronic inflammatory disorders and colitis-associated cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27623987>NMR-based urinary profiling of lactulose/mannitol ratio used to assess the altered intestinal permeability in acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) patients.</a></h2><p>The article presents a simplified NMR-based protocol for urinary profiling of lactulose/mannitol ratio (LMR) and demonstrates here its utility to assess increased intestinal permeability (IP) in patients with acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). ACLF is a serious clinical complication associated with chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). The major risk factor in its development is increased IP (' '), which has been linked to disease progression and to infectious complications. However, IP has seldom been investigated in patients with ACLF, even though patients frequently report gastrointestinal disorders and associated complications. To this end, we first optimized the NMR-based targeted profiling of urinary metabolites (i.e. actulose, mannitol, and creatinine) and subsequently used this resulted protocol (a) first to evaluate the altered IP in ACLF patients and then () to explore its utility for monitoring the treatment response in these patients. The normal profiles were obtained for 7 age and sex matched healthy volunteers. The results revealed that the urinary LMR excretion was significantly higher in ACLF patients compared to normal controls (median ~0.7, range (0.12-2.84), vs median ~0.11, range (0.02-0.28), p < 0.001) suggesting that the ACLF patients' exhibit altered IP. However, the LMR excretion in six clinically improved follow-up ACLF patients was comparable to normal controls indicating restored IP after the treatment. The protocol-as demonstrated here with ACLF-is equally applicable for evaluating IP or mucosal barrier function in other intestinal disorders with reasonable sensitivity and specificity, highlighting its general utility.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20060895>Species delineation and clonal diversity in four Bifidobacterium species as revealed by multilocus sequencing.</a></h2><p>The genus Bifidobacterium comprises several species that are important contributors to the  microbiome, with some strains having beneficial health effects. Understanding the evolutionary emergence of advantageous biological properties requires knowledge of the genetic diversity and clonal structure of species. We sequenced seven housekeeping genes in 119 Bifidobacterium strains of Bifidobacterium animalis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve and Bifidobacterium longum. Phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences delineated sequence clusters that correspond to previously named taxa, and suggested that . longum subsp. infantis is a nascent lineage emerging from within . longum subsp. longum. Clear traces of recombination among distant bifidobacterial species indicate  species borders and warn against the practice of single gene-based identification. Multilocus sequence typing achieved precise strain genotyping, with discrimination indices above 99% in . bifidum, . breve and . longum, providing a powerful tool for strain traceability, colonization dynamics and ecological studies.

While JAM-A has been reported to facilitate tissue infiltration of leukocytes under inflammatory conditions, the contributions of leukocyte-expressed JAM-A in vivo remain unresolved. We investigated the role of leukocyte-expressed JAM-A in acute peritonitis induced by zymosan, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or TNFα using mice with selective loss of JAM-A in myelomonocytic cells (LysM-Cre;Jam-a). Surprisingly, in LysM-Cre;Jam-a mice, loss of JAM-A did not affect neutrophil (PMN) recruitment into the peritoneum in response to zymosan, LPS, or TNFα although it was significantly reduced in Jam-a mice. In parallel, Jam-a peritoneal macrophages exhibited diminished CXCL1 chemokine production and decreased activation of NF-kB, whereas those from LysM-Cre;Jam-a mice were unaffected. Using Villin-Cre;Jam-a mice, targeted loss of JAM-A on intestinal epithelial cells resulted in increased intestinal permeability along with reduced peritoneal PMN migration as well as lower levels of CXCL1 and active NF-kB similar to that observed in Jam-a animals. Interestingly, in germ-free Villin-Cre;Jam-a mice, PMN recruitment was unaffected suggesting dependence on  microbiota.

The aim of this article is to present a new hypothesis connecting the inflammatory theory of depression with IgG food hypersensitivity and   syndrome. This new potential pathway that may mediate the pathogenesis of depression implies the existence of subsequent developmental stages. Overproduction of zonulin triggered, for example, by gliadin through activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and protease-activated receptor causes loosening of the tight junction barrier and an increase in permeability of the  wall (' '). This results in a process allowing larger molecules that would normally stay in the  to cross into the bloodstream and in the induction of IgG-dependent food sensitivity. This condition causes an increased immune response and consequently induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines, which in turn may lead to the development of depressive symptoms. It seems advisable to assess the intestinal permeability using as a marker, for example, zonulin and specific IgG concentrations against selected nutritional components in patients with depression. In the case of increased IgG concentrations, the implementation of an elimination-rotation diet may prove to be an effective method of reducing inflammation. This new paradigm in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders linking  , IgG-dependent food sensitivity, inflammation, and depression is promising, but still needs further studies to confirm this theory.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27142301>Early-life enteric infections: relation between chronic systemic inflammation and poor cognition in children.</a></h2><p>The intestinal microbiota undergoes active remodeling in the first 6 to 18 months of life, during which time the characteristics of the adult microbiota are developed. This process is strongly influenced by the early diet and enteric pathogens. Enteric infections and malnutrition early in life may favor microbiota dysbiosis and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, resulting in intestinal barrier dysfunction and translocation of intestinal bacterial products, ultimately leading to low-grade, chronic, subclinical systemic inflammation. The  -derived low-grade systemic inflammation may have profound consequences on the -liver-brain axis, compromising normal growth, metabolism, and cognitive development. This review examines recent data suggesting that early-life enteric infections that lead to intestinal barrier disruption may shift the intestinal microbiota toward chronic systemic inflammation and subsequent impaired cognitive development.© The Author(s) 2016.

ALD pathogenesis requires endotoxemia. Our previous studies showed that increased intestinal permeability is the major cause of endotoxemia, and that this  leakiness is dependent on alcohol stimulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in both alcoholic subjects and rodent models of alcoholic steatohepatitis. The mechanism of the alcohol-induced, iNOS-mediated disruption of the intestinal barrier function is not known. We have recently shown that alcohol stimulates activation of the transcription factor Snail and biomarkers of epithelial mesenchymal transition. As activated Snail disrupts tight junctional proteins, we hypothesized that activation of Snail by iNOS might be one of the key signaling pathways mediating alcohol-stimulated intestinal epithelial cell hyperpermeability.We measured intestinal permeability in alcohol-fed C57BL/6 control and iNOS knockout (KO) mice, and measured Snail protein expression in the intestines of these mice. We then examined intestinal epithelial permeability using the Caco-2 cell model of the intestinal barrier ± small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibition of Snail. We assessed Snail activation by alcohol in Caco-2 cells ± inhibition of iNOS with L-NIL or siRNA. Finally, we assessed Snail activation by alcohol ± inhibition with siRNA for p21-activated kinase (PAK1).Our data show that chronic alcohol feeding promotes intestinal hyperpermeability in wild-type BL/6, but not in iNOS KO mice. Snail protein expression was increased in the intestines of alcohol-treated wild-type mice, but not in iNOS KO mice. siRNA inhibition of Snail significantly inhibited alcohol-induced hyperpermeability in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Alcohol stimulation of Snail(pS246) activation was blocked by inhibition of iNOS with L-NIL or with siRNA. siRNA inhibition of PAK1 significantly inhibited alcohol-mediated activation of Snail in Caco-2 cells.Our data confirmed our prior results and further demonstrated that alcohol-induced  leakiness in rodents and intestinal epithelial cell monolayers is iNOS dependent. Our data also support a novel role for Snail activation in alcohol-induced, iNOS-mediated intestinal hyperpermeability and that PAK1 is responsible for activation of Snail at Ser246 with alcohol stimulation. Identification of these mechanisms for alcohol-induced intestinal hyperpermeability may provide new therapeutic targets for prevention and treatment of alcohol-induced  , endotoxemia, and endotoxin-associated complications of alcoholism such as ALD.2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26184290>Gluten Psychosis: Confirmation of a New Clinical Entity.</a></h2><p>Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome diagnosed in patients with symptoms that respond to removal of gluten from the diet, after celiac disease and wheat allergy have been excluded.

We report a pediatric case of a psychotic disorder clearly related to NCGS and investigate the causes by a review of literature. The pathogenesis of neuro-psychiatric manifestations of NCGS is unclear. It has been hypothesized that: (a) a " " allows some gluten peptides to cross the intestinal membrane and the blood brain barrier, affecting the endogenous opiate system and neurotransmission; or () gluten peptides may set up an innate immune response in the brain similar to that described in the  mucosa, causing exposure from neuronal cells of a transglutaminase primarily expressed in the brain. The present case-report confirms that psychosis may be a manifestation of NCGS, and may also involve children; the diagnosis is difficult with many cases remaining undiagnosed. Well-designed prospective studies are needed to establish the real role of gluten as a triggering factor in neuro-psychiatric disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30828551>Low Serum Levels of Zonulin in Patients with HCV-Infected Chronic Liver Diseases.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to assess the implication of Zonulin, a mediator protein synthesized by intestine and the liver,in patients with chronic liver diseases.Twenty-six patients with chronic liver diseases due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis  virus (HBV) were enrolled in this study. Out of total 26 patients, 17 were diagnosed as chronic hepatitis (CH) and 9 were patients with liver cirrhosis (LC). Twenty-four of these patients were infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the rest two by hepatitis  virus (HBV). The study was conducted at Saiseikai-Imabari Hospital, Imabari, Ehime, Japan. Serum levels of Zonulin along with different parameters of liver function test were measured in all patients and comparative analyses were accomplished.The serum levels of Zonulin were significantly lower in CH patients compared to controls (p<0.001). Also, the levels of Zonulin were significantly lower in patients with LC compared to CH and normal controls (p<0.001). Further analysis revealed that serum Zonulin was significantly lower in patients with LC having ascites than those without ascites (p <0.05). There was a significant correlation of serum levels of Zonulin with platelet count, cholinesterase, and albumin in patients with chronic liver diseases.Decreased levels of Zonulin may be related to impaired production of this mediator in the diseased liver. It will be tempting to assess the regulation of Zonulin in the liver, a production site of the mediator.LC: Liver cirrhosis, CH: Chronic hepatitis, HCV: Hepatitis C virus, HBV: Hepatitis  virus, LGS:   syndrome Akao T, Morita A, Onji M, Miyake T, Watanabe R, Uehara T, Kawasaki K, Miyaike J, Oomoto M.

The pathological luminal intricate eco-events produce multiple signals that irradiate the entire body, resulting in a plethora of extra-intestinal manifestations. Nutrients, dysbiosis, dysbiotic components and their mobilome, post-translational modification of naive proteins, inter-enterocyte's tight junction dysfunction resulting in a  , microbial lateral genetic transfer of virulent genes, the sensing network of the enteric nervous systems and the ensuing pro-inflammatory messengers are mutually orchestrating the autoimmune interplay. Genetic-environmental-luminal events-mucosal changes are driving centrifugally the remote organs autoimmunity, establishing extra-intestinal multi organ injury. Exploring the underlying intestinal eco-events, the sensing and the delivery pathways and mechanisms that induce the peripheral tissues' damages might unravel new therapeutical strategies to prevent and help the gluten affected patients.Copyright © 2019.
