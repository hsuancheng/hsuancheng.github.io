Recent studies have shown that both are exerted robustly in rodents and humans. If intact, these functions exert beneficial effects on  and diabetes, respectively. Disruption of both occurs due to a condition known as hypothalamic insulin resistance, which is caused by  and the overconsumption of saturated fat. An enormous volume of literature addresses the molecular mechanisms of hypothalamic insulin resistance. IKKβ and JNK are major players in the inflammation pathway, which is activated by saturated fatty acids that induce hypothalamic insulin resistance. Two major  phosphatases, PTP-1B and TCPTP, are upregulated in chronic overeating. They dephosphorylate the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate proteins, resulting in hypothalamic insulin resistance. Prolonged hyperinsulinemia with excessive nutrition activates the mTOR/S6 kinase pathway, thereby enhancing IRS-1 serine phosphorylation to induce hypothalamic insulin resistance. Other mechanisms associated with this condition include hypothalamic gliosis and disturbed insulin transport into the central nervous system. Unveiling the precise molecular mechanisms involved in hypothalamic insulin resistance is important for developing new ways of treating  and type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31146894>Cyclic glycine-proline administration normalizes high-fat diet-induced synaptophysin expression in obese rats.</a></h2><p>Childhood metabolic disorders are associated with insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 deficiency, which can adversely affect brain development and function. As a neuropeptide, cyclic glycine-proline (cGP) improves IGF-1 function in brain and regulates IGF-1 bioavailability in plasma. Whether such a regulatory process mediates the neurotrophic effects of cGP remains unknown. This study examined the effects cGP treatment on synaptic expression and their association with IGF-1, IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-2 and cGP concentrations in the brain of rats with high fat diet (HFD)-induced . Male rats received either a HFD or a standard chow diet (STD) from weaning and were then treated with either saline or cGP from 11 to 15 weeks of age. The concentrations of cGP, IGF-1 and IGFBP-2 were measured in the brain tissues using ELISA and HPLC-MS. The expressions of synaptic markers were evaluated in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and striatum using immunohistochemical staining. Compared to the STD group, IGF-1 and IGFBP-2, but not cGP concentrations, were lower in the HFD groups. The expression of hippocampal synaptophysin, glutamate receptor-1, GFAP and striatal -hydroxylase were also reduced in the HFD groups. While treatment did not alter tissue IGF-1, cGP administration that increased the concentration of cGP in brain tissues, normalized the expression of synaptophysin, GFAP and -hydroxylase, but not glutamate receptor-1. IGF-1 concentration in brain tissues correlated with the expression of all synaptic markers. HFD feeding reduced synaptic expression and tissue IGF-1 in brains which were closely associated, thus suggesting IGF-1 in the brain is largely bioavailable. Without increasing IGF-1 in the brain, administration of cGP normalized synaptic expression, possibly be mediated through increasing bioavailable IGF-1, but further studies are required to confirm this.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

All of these hormones delay gastric emptying, except for ghrelin and motilin which accelerate gastric emptying. These effects on gastric emptying parallel the effects of the hormones on satiation (by those retarding emptying) and increase appetite by those that accelerate emptying. Indeed, in addition to the effects of these hormones on hypothalamic appetite centers and glycemic control, there is evidence that some of their biological effects are mediated through actions on the stomach, particularly with the glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs or agonists used in treating .Effects of gastrointestinal hormones on gastric emptying are increasingly recognized as important mediators of satiation and postprandial glycemic control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30043179>Programming of central and peripheral insulin resistance by low birthweight and postnatal catch-up growth in male mice.</a></h2><p>Intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) followed by accelerated postnatal growth is associated with an increased risk of  and type 2 diabetes. We aimed to determine central and peripheral insulin sensitivity in mice that underwent IUGR followed by postnatal catch-up growth and investigate potential molecular mechanisms underpinning their physiology.We used a C57BL/6J mouse model of maternal diet-induced IUGR (maternal diet, 8% protein) followed by cross-fostering to a normal nutrition dam (maternal diet, 20% protein) and litter size manipulation to cause accelerated postnatal catch-up growth. We performed intracerebroventricular insulin injection and hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp studies to examine the effect of this early nutritional manipulation on central and peripheral insulin resistance. Furthermore, we performed quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting to examine the expression of key insulin-signalling components in discrete regions of the hypothalamus.IUGR followed by accelerated postnatal growth caused impaired glucose tolerance and peripheral insulin resistance. In addition, these 'recuperated' animals were resistant to the anorectic effects of central insulin administration. This central insulin resistance was associated with reduced protein levels of the p110β subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus. Expression of the gene encoding protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B; Ptpn1) was also increased specifically in this region of the hypothalamus.Mice that undergo IUGR followed by catch-up growth display peripheral and central insulin resistance in adulthood. Recuperated offspring show changes in expression/phosphorylation of components of the insulin signalling pathway in the ARC. These defects may contribute to the resistance to the anorectic effects of central insulin, as well as the impaired glucose homeostasis seen in these animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108319>Targeted SHP-1 Silencing Modulates the Macrophage Phenotype, Leading to Metabolic Improvement in Dietary Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>Chronic over-nutrition promotes adipocyte hypertrophy that creates inflammatory milieu leading to macrophage infiltration and their phenotypic switching during . The SH2 domain-containing protein  phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) has been identified as an important player in inflammatory diseases involving macrophages. However, the role of SHP-1 in modulating the macrophage phenotype has not been elucidated yet. In the present work, we show that adipose tissue macrophage (ATM)-specific deletion of SHP-1 using glucan particle-loaded siRNA improves the metabolic phenotype in dietary obese insulin-resistant mice. The molecular mechanism involves AT remodeling via reducing crown-like structure formation and balancing the pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory macrophage (M2) population. Therefore, targeting ATM-specific SHP-1 using glucan-particle-loaded SHP-1 antagonists could be of immense therapeutic use for the treatment of -associated insulin resistance.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In the Young Finn's Study, BCAA and, to a lesser extent, the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and  were associated with insulin resistance (IR) in men but not in women, whereas the gluconeogenic amino acids alanine, glutamine, or glycine, and several other amino acids (i.e. histidine, arginine, and tryptophan) did not show an association with IR.  may track more strongly than metabolic syndrome and diabetes with elevated BCAA. In a study of 1302 people aged 40-79; higher levels of BCAA tracked with older age, male sex, and metabolic syndrome, as well as with , cardiovascular risk, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and uric acid. Medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines, by-products of mitochondrial catabolism of BCAAs, as well as branched-chain keto acids and the BCAA themselves distinguished obese people having versus not having features of IR, and in a study of 898 patients with essential hypertension, the BCAA and  and phenylalanine were associated with metabolic syndrome and impaired fasting glucose. In a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies, elevations in BCAA and, to a lesser extent, in alanine tracked with IR, whereas higher levels of glutamine and glycine were associated with lesser likelihood of IR. Given these associations with IR, it is not surprising that a number of studies have shown higher BCAA levels in people with and prior to development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), although this has particularly been shown in Caucasian and Asian ethnic groups while not appearing to occur in African Americans. Similarly, higher BCAA levels track with cardiovascular disease. [Figure: see text] The metabolism of BCAA involves two processes: (i) a reversible process catalysed by a branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT), either cytosolic or mitochondrial, requiring pyridoxal to function as an amino group carrier, by which the BCAA with 2-ketoglutarate produce a branched-chain keto acid plus glutamate; and (ii) the irreversible mitochondrial process catalysed by branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) leading to formation of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), propionyl-CoA, and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA from leucine, valine, and isoleucine, respectively, which enter the tricarboxylic acid (Krebs) cycle as acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA, respectively, leading to ATP formation. The BCAA stimulate secretion of both insulin and glucagon and, when given orally, of both glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), with oral administration leading to greater and more prolonged insulin and glucagon secretion. Insulin may particularly reduce BCAA turnover to a greater extent than that of other amino acids, and decreases the appearance and increases the uptake of amino acids. However, older studies of the effect of glucose or insulin on BCAA concentrations and rates of leucine appearance and oxidation showed no reduction in T2D, although the higher baseline levels of BCAA in  have long been recognized. Impaired function of BCAT and BCKDH has been posited, either as a primary genetic abnormality or due to effects of elevated fatty acids, proinflammatory cytokines, or insulin levels with consequent accumulation of branched-chain keto acids and metabolites such as diacylglycerol and ceramide, potentially contributing to the development of further insulin resistance, and decreased skeletal muscle BCAT and BCKDH expression has been shown in people with diabetes, supporting this concept. A Mendelian randomization study used measured variation in genes involved in BCAA metabolism to test the hypothesis of a causal effect of modifiable exposure on IR, showing that variants in protein phosphatase, Mg /Mn dependent 1K (PPM1K), a gene encoding the mitochondrial phosphatase activating the BCKDH complex, are associated with T2D, but another such study suggested that genetic variations associated with IR are causally related to higher BCAA levels. Another hypothesis involves the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is activated by BCAA, as well as by insulin and glucose via cellular ATP availability. If this is the relevant pathway, BCAA overload may cause insulin resistance by activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), as well as by leading to increases in acylcarnitines, with mTOR seen in this scenario as a central signal of cross-talk between the BCAA and insulin. At this point, whether whole-body or tissue-specific BCAA metabolism is increased or decreased in states of insulin-resistant  and T2D is uncertain. Insulin action in the hypothalamus induces but overfeeding decreases hepatic BCKDH, leading to the concept that hypothalamic insulin resistance impairs BCAA metabolism in  and diabetes, so that plasma BCAAs may be markers of hypothalamic insulin action rather than direct mediators of changes in IR. A way to address this may be to understand the effects of changes in diet and other interventions on BCAA, as well as on IR and T2D. In an animal model, lowering dietary BCAA increased energy expenditure and improved insulin sensitivity. Two large human population studies showed an association of estimated dietary BCAA intake with T2D risk, although another population study showed higher dietary BCAA to be associated with lower T2D risk. Ethnic differences, reflecting underlying differences in genetic variants, may be responsible for such differences. In the study of Asghari et al. in the current issue of the Journal of Diabetes, BCAA intake was associated with the development of subsequent IR. Studies of bariatric surgery suggest lower basal and post-insulin infusion BCAA levels are associated with greater insulin sensitivity, with reductions in BCAA not seen with weight loss per se with gastric band procedures, but occurring after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, an intervention that may have metabolic benefits over and above those from reduction in body weight. The gut microbiota may be important for the supply of the BCAA to mammalian hosts, either by de novo biosynthesis or by modifying nutrient absorption. A final fascinating preliminary set of observations is that of the effects of empagliflozin on metabolomics; evidence of increased Krebs cycle activation and of higher levels of BCAA metabolites, such as acylcarnitines, suggests that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition may, to some extent, involve BCAA metabolism. Certainly, we do not yet have a full understanding of these complex associations. However, the suggestion of multiple roles of BCAA in the development of IR promises to be important and to lead to the development of novel effective T2D therapies.© 2018 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30957405>Association between PTPN22-1123G/C and susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>The incidence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) varies greatly among different ethnic groups, suggesting genetic susceptibility. The several genetic variants of protein  phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22-1123G/C, rs2488457) have been widely examined. We systematically evaluated the association of PTPN22-1123 and RA risk by pooling the related studies conducted in different races.Literature was searched using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Korean scientific database, Chinese medical databases, and the Indian medical database to identify eligible studies for determining the association of PTPN22-1123 and RA risk. The association was assessed in five genetic random effects models including the allelic (AG), recessive (RG), dominant (DG), homozygous (HMG), and heterozygous (HTG) genetic models. Subgroup analyses stratified by ethnicity (Asians and non-Asians) were assessed.A total of 10 articles were selected that met the criteria including Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Subjects included 14 186 healthy controls and 5735 with RA. The AG, RG, DG, and HMG genetic models showed no heterogeneity, but the HTG model showed heterogeneity. AG and RG did not exhibit publication bias in any of the studies including Asian and non-Asian subgroups. The overall effect of PTPN22-1123 on RA risk in all genetic random models showed significant positive associations (AG: odds ratio [OR]: 1.24; CI: 1.08-1.42; P = 0.002; RG: OR: 1.35; CI: 1.15-1.59; P = 0.0003; DG: OR: 1.42; CI: 1.09-1.85; P = 0.009; HMG: OR: 1.69; CI: 1.22-2.34; P = 0.002). A significant association when pooling the studies was only revealed in non-Asians (P < 0.05), but no significant relationship was shown in Asians.People with C allele in PTPN22-1123 increased the risk of RA only in non-Asians.© 2019 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29601891>Dehydroepiandrosterone supplementation is not beneficial in the late postmenopausal period in diet-induced obese rats.</a></h2><p>Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is an adrenal steroid hormone that is a precursor of sexual hormones. It is reduced during aging and is strongly associated with insulin resistance and . There is evidence for beneficial effects of this steroid, in both human and animal models, during perimenopause. However, the impact of DHEA treatment during late postmenopause on glucose metabolism is not clearly documented. We tested the hypothesis that DHEA supplementation could improve insulin sensitivity in an ovariectomized obese rat model (OVX) that was fed a high-fat diet for 11 weeks.Female Wistar rats at 8 weeks of age were OVX or SHAM-operated. Eight weeks after the surgery, the animals were randomly treated with vehicle or DHEA for 3 weeks. Food intake, metabolic parameters and insulin sensitivity were evaluated.Following the ovariectomy, increased body weight gain, adiposity index, and feeding efficiency were observed, despite there being no change in food and energy intake. The OVX rats also displayed glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, decreased insulin-induced IRS1/2  phosphorylation in the skeletal muscle, and reduced serum VLDL-c and TAG levels. OVX rats treated with 10 mg/kg DHEA (OVX + DHEA) exhibited estradiol (E) serum levels similar to SHAM animals, with no change in uterus mass. DHEA treatment also resulted in an increase in energy intake.Despite the positive effects of DHEA supplementation observed in menopausal women and ovariectomized rats, a potential negative effect on glucose metabolism and insulin action in the late postmenopausal condition in diet-induced obese OVX rats are reported.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Although precise mechanisms for this connection have not been elucidated, we have proposed mechanisms by which orally administered periodontopathic bacteria might induce changes in gut microbiota composition, barrier function, and immune system, resulting in an increased risk of diseases characterized by low-grade systemic inflammation. Accumulating evidence suggests a profound effect of altered gut metabolite profiles on overall host health. Therefore, it is possible that  can affect these metabolites. To test this, C57BL/6 mice were administered with  W83 orally twice a week for 5 weeks and compared with sham-inoculated mice. The gut microbial communities were analyzed by pyrosequencing the 16S rRNA genes. Inferred metagenomic analysis was used to determine the relative abundance of KEGG pathways encoded in the gut microbiota. Serum metabolites were analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics coupled with multivariate statistical analyses. Oral administration of  induced a change in gut microbiota composition. The distributions of metabolic pathways differed between the two groups, including those related to amino acid metabolism and, in particular, the genes for phenylalanine, , and tryptophan biosynthesis. Also, alanine, glutamine, histidine, , and phenylalanine were significantly increased in the serum of -administered mice. In addition to altering immune modulation and gut barrier function, oral administration of  affects the host's metabolic profile. This supports our hypothesis regarding a gut-mediated systemic pathology resulting from periodontal disease. Increasing evidence suggest that alterations of the gut microbiome underlie metabolic disease pathology by modulating gut metabolite profiles. We have shown that orally administered , a representative periodontopathic bacterium, alters the gut microbiome; that may be a novel mechanism by which periodontitis increases the risk of various diseases. Given the association between periodontal disease and metabolic diseases, it is possible that  can affect the metabolites. Metabolite profiling analysis demonstrated that several amino acids related to a risk of developing diabetes and  were elevated in -administered mice. Our results revealed that the increased risk of various diseases by  might be mediated at least in part by alteration of metabolic profiles. The findings should add new insights into potential links between periodontal disease and systemic disease for investigators in periodontal disease and also for investigators in the field of other diseases, such as metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2018 Kato et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298176>Biological underpinnings from psychosocial stress towards appetite and  during youth: research implications towards metagenomics, epigenomics and metabolomics.</a></h2><p>Psychosocial stress, uncontrolled eating and  are three interrelated epidemiological phenomena already present during youth. This broad narrative conceptual review summarises main biological underpinnings of the stress-diet- pathway and how new techniques can further knowledge. Cortisol seems the main biological factor from stress towards central adiposity; and diet, physical activity and sleep are the main behavioural pathways. Within stress-diet, the concepts of comfort food and emotional eating are highlighted, as cortisol affects reward pathways and appetite brain centres with a role for insulin, leptin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), endocannabinoids, orexin and gastrointestinal hormones. More recently researched biological underpinnings are microbiota, epigenetic modifications and metabolites. First, the gut microbiota reaches the stress-regulating and appetite-regulating brain centres via the gut-brain axis. Second, epigenetic analyses are recommended as diet, , stress and gut microbiota can change gene expression which then affects appetite, energy homeostasis and stress reactivity. Finally, metabolomics would be a good technique to disentangle stress-diet- interactions as multiple biological pathways are involved. Saliva might be an ideal biological matrix as it allows metagenomic (oral microbiota), epigenomic and metabolomic analyses.

To characterize transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes in HSCs during development, we leveraged high-throughput genomic approaches to profile miRNAs, lincRNAs, and mRNAs. Our findings indicate that HSCs manifest distinct alternative splicing patterns in key hematopoietic regulators. Detailed analysis of the splicing dynamics and function of one such regulator, HMGA2, identified an alternative isoform that escapes miRNA-mediated targeting. We further identified the splicing kinase CLK3 that, by regulating HMGA2 splicing, preserves HMGA2 function in the setting of an increase in let-7 miRNA levels, delineating how CLK3 and HMGA2 form a functional axis that influences HSC properties during development. Collectively, our study highlights molecular mechanisms by which alternative splicing and miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation impact the molecular identity and stage-specific developmental features of human HSCs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Akt phosphorylation mediates a neuroprotective effect against ischemic injury. Recently, a protein- phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) inhibitor (KY-226) was developed to elicit anti-diabetic and anti- effects via enhancement of insulin signaling. Previously, we reported that the nonselective PTP1B inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate, rescued neurons from delayed neuronal death during brain ischemia. In this study, we confirmed the ameliorative effects of KY-226 on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury using a murine model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). ICR mice were subjected to MCAO for 2 h followed by reperfusion. Although KY-226 permeability was poor through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) of normal mice, it could penetrate through the BBB of mice after I/R insult. Intraperitoneal KY-226 administration elicited dose-dependent reductions in infarcted brain areas and improved neurological deficits. The neuroprotective effects of KY-266 were obtained when administered within 0.5 h after reperfusion. KY-226 (10 mg/kg) also restored reduced Akt phosphorylation and eNOS phosphorylation (Ser-1177) levels following I/R insult. Moreover, 10 mg/kg of KY-226 improved I/R-induced decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Furthermore, KY-226 attenuated the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mouse cortex. These results suggest that KY-226 may act as a novel therapeutic candidate for ischemic stroke. Activation of Akt and ERK possibly underlie the neuroprotective mechanism of KY-226.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Molecular analysis of mutations in the  gene along with determination of environmental, clinical and haematological risk factors associated with breast cancer patients is need of hour to improve patient's healthcare. Somatic JAK2 valine-to-phenylalanine (617 codon) mutation is one of the widely prevalent mutations.Blood was collected from seventy breast cancer patients after their consent. The questionnaire included risk factors, age group, locality, number of children, tumor type, family history, time of initial diagnosis, no of cycles/month, water conditions and exposure to radiations. Molecular analysis were carried out from genomic DNA using Sanger sequencing and allele-specific PCR to check the V617F point mutation.The breast cancer risk factors includes unfiltered water (68.57%), urban (58.57%), menopause (55.71%), family history of cancer (18.57%), tumor grades (II, 37.14% and III, 35.71%), consanguineous marriages (44.28%) and having more than 3-4 children (45.71%).

Repeated blood and muscle samples were obtained to assess protein digestion and amino acid absorption kinetics, and basal and postprandial myofibrillar protein synthesis rates.Exogenous phenylalanine appearance rates increased after protein ingestion in both groups (P < 0.001), with a total of 53 ± 1% and 53 ± 2% of dietary protein-derived phenylalanine appearing in the circulation over the 5-h postprandial period in lean and obese men, respectively (P = 0.82). After protein ingestion, whole-body protein synthesis and oxidation rates increased to a greater extent in lean men than in the obese (P-interaction < 0.05), resulting in a higher whole-body protein net balance in the lean than in the obese (7.1 ± 0.2 and 4.6 ± 0.4 µmol phenylalanine · h-1 · kg-1, respectively; P-interaction < 0.001). Myofibrillar protein synthesis rates increased from 0.030 ± 0.002 and 0.028 ± 0.003%/h in the postabsorptive period to 0.034 ± 0.002 and 0.035 ± 0.003%.h-1 in the 5-h postprandial period (P = 0.03) in lean and obese men, respectively, with no differences between groups (P-interaction = 0.58).Basal, postabsorptive myofibrillar protein synthesis rates do not differ between lean and obese middle-aged men.

Protein  phosphatase, non-receptor type 1 (PTPN1) located on chromosome 20q13, could negatively regulate insulin and leptin signaling. In this study, we determined the association of PTPN1 polymorphisms with BC risk.We analyzed the distribution of 11 selected PTPN1 single nucleotide polymorphisms in Chinese female patients with BC (n = 953) and healthy controls (n = 963) based on a multicenter case-control study. The association of PTPN1 genotypes and haplotypes frequencies with BC risk were determined by logistic regression analysis. Analyses were further stratified by body mass index (BMI), waist-hip rate (WHR), diabetes mellitus history, and fasting plasma glucose level. The eQTL (expression Quantitative Trait Loci) analysis for PTPN1 was conducted by GTEx database.There were significant differences between BC cases and control groups in menopausal status, number of births, and BMI. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs3215684, rs3787345, rs718049, and rs718050) decreased overall BC risk, and other seven SNPs showed no significant association with BC risk.

Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is a key catabolic mediator of energy homeostasis and an important anorexigenic neuropeptide in the control of energy balance and thermogenesis. However, it was not well explored if α-MSH can modulate long-term weight loss therapy responses in a dependent manner according to its concentration. Our hypothesis is that a high α-MSH concentration at baseline promotes better modulation of anorexigenic/orexigenic pathways in obese adolescents.One hundred ten post-pubertal obese adolescents (body mass index >95th percentile) were submitted to 1 year of interdisciplinary therapy (clinical, nutritional, psychological, physical exercise, and physiotherapy support). Body composition and plasma levels of α-MSH, neuropeptide Y (NPY), melanin-concentrating hormone, and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) were measured before and after therapy. The volunteers were grouped on the basis of Tertiles of α-MSH concentration: Low (<0.75 ng/mL), Medium (≤0.76 to ≥1.57 ng/mL), and High (>1.57 ng/mL). Significance was set as p < 0.05.The treatment promoted a significant improvement in body adiposity and fat free mass for all groups. It is important to note that only in the high α-MSH group, a significant increase of the α-MSH/NPY ratio and decrease NPY/AgRP ratio post treatment were observed.The high α-MSH concentration promotes better modulation of anorexigenic/orexigenic pathways in obese adolescents following long-term weight loss therapy and this is important in clinical practice.© 2018 S.

Millsp with a purity of 98.22%, on the regulatory mechanisms of glucose and lipid metabolism. HepG2 cells transfected with a protein‑ phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) overexpression plasmid were established. The cells, induced with insulin resistance by dexamethasone (Dex) treatment, together with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) model rats and ob/ob mice, were used in the present study. The effects of CAA treatment on the differentiation of 3T3‑L1 adipocytes were determined using Oil Red O. The expression levels of insulin signaling factors were detected via reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. The results revealed that the overexpression of PTP1B contributed to insulin resistance, which was reversed by CAA treatment via inhibiting the activity of PTP1B and by regulating the expression of associated insulin signaling factors. The treatment of cell lines with Dex led to increased expression of PTP1B but decreased glucose consumption, and decreased  phosphorylation of insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1, and phosphoinositide 3‑kinase. Treatment with CAA not only reduced the fasting blood glucose levels and protected organs from damage, but also reduced the serum fasting levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and low‑density lipoprotein cholesterol in the T2DM rats. CAA treatment also inhibited adipocyte differentiation and decreased the mRNA levels of various adipogenic genes. Furthermore, CAA treatment restored the transduction of insulin signaling by regulating the expression of PTP1B and associated insulin signaling factors. Treatment with CAA also reduced the problems associated with hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia.

In view of these compositional differences, we studied the metabolic responses to intake of casein, hydrolyzed casein, and whey proteins in overweight and moderately obese men and women by investigating select urinary and blood plasma metabolites.A total of 21 urinary and 23 plasma metabolites were identified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The postprandial plasma metabolites revealed a significant diet-time interaction for isoleucine (P = 0.001) and  (P = 0.001). The level of isoleucine and  peaked 90 min postprandially with a 1.4-fold difference following intake of whey proteins compared with either casein or hydrolyzed casein. A 1.2-fold higher urinary level of lactate was observed after intake of whey proteins compared with intake of intact casein (P < 0.01).The plasma metabolites revealed different amino acid profiles reflecting the amino acid composition of casein and whey proteins. Furthermore, the results support that casein hydrolysates neither affect the postprandial amino acid absorption rate nor the amino acid level compared with that of intact casein.

Celastrol-administered mice at 100 μg/kg decrease food consumption and body weight via a leptin-dependent mechanism, yet its molecular targets in this pathway remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate in vivo that celastrol-induced weight loss is largely mediated by the inhibition of leptin negative regulators protein  phosphatase (PTP) 1B (PTP1B) and T-cell PTP (TCPTP) in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus. We show in vitro that celastrol binds reversibly and inhibits noncompetitively PTP1B and TCPTP. NMR data map the binding site to an allosteric site in the catalytic domain that is in proximity of the active site. By using a panel of PTPs implicated in hypothalamic leptin signaling, we show that celastrol additionally inhibited PTEN and SHP2 but had no activity toward other phosphatases of the PTP family. These results suggest that PTP1B and TCPTP in the ARC are essential for celastrol's weight lowering effects in adult obese mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30230471>Insulin regulates POMC neuronal plasticity to control glucose metabolism.</a></h2><p>Hypothalamic neurons respond to nutritional cues by altering gene expression and neuronal excitability.

Diabetes emerged as a serious health issue in the industrialized and developing country especially in the Asian pacific region. Out of the two major categories of diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes is more prevalent, almost 90 to 95% cases, and the main cause of this is insulin resistance. The main cause of the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus has been found to be insulin resistance. The type 2 diabetes mellitus may be managed by the change in lifestyle, physical activities, dietary modifications and medications. The major currently available management strategies are sulfonylureas, biguanides, thiazolidinediones, α-glucosidase inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist. Binding of insulin on the extracellular unit of insulin receptor sparks  kinase of the insulin receptor which induces autophosphorylation. The phosphorylation of the  is regulated by insulin and leptin molecules. Protein  phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) works as a negative governor for the insulin signalling pathways, as it dephosphorylates the  of the insulin receptor and suppresses the insulin signalling cascade. The compounds or molecules which inhibit the negative regulation of PTP1B can have an inductive effect on the insulin pathway and finally help in the management of diabetes mellitus. PTP1B could be an emerging therapeutic strategy for diabetes management. There are a number of clinical and basic research results which suggest that induced expression of PTP1B reduces insulin resistance. In this review, we briefly elaborate and explain the place of PTP1B and its significance in diabetes as well as a recent development in the PTP1B inhibitors as an antidiabetic therapy.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30518367>Electric stimulation of ears accelerates body weight loss mediated by high-fat to low-fat diet switch accompanied by increased white adipose tissue browning in C57BL/6 J mice.</a></h2><p>Weight reduction frequently occurs in patients receiving vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy. Therefore, we hypothesized that during dietary intervention for weight loss, auricular electric stimulation (AES), an alternative of VNS, accelerates weight loss by increasing white adipose tissue (WAT) browning and increases energy expenditure.C57BL/6J male mice were fed a high-fat diet for 5 wk. to induce , then switched to a low-fat diet for 5 wk. and allocated into 3 groups to receive 2 Hz electric stimulation on ears, electrode clamps only, or nothing (AES, Sham and Ctrl, respectively).Switching to a low-fat diet reduced body weight progressively in all 3 groups, with the greatest reduction in the AES group.

In the current study, we aimed to investigate the protective effect of EGCG on metabolic misalignment and in balancing the redox status in mice liver and HepG2 cells under insulin resistance condition. Our results indicated that EGCG accelerates the glucose uptake and evokes IRS-1/Akt/GLUT2 signaling pathway via dampening the expression of protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). Consistently, ectopic expression of PTP1B by Ad-PTP1B substantially impaired EGCG-elicited IRS-1/Akt/GLUT2 signaling pathway. Moreover, EGCG co-treatment stimulated nuclear translocation of Nrf2 by provoking P13K/AKT signaling pathway and thus modulated the downstream expressions of antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1 and NQO-1 in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, knockdown Nrf2 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) notably enhanced the expression of PTP1B and blunt EGCG-stimulated glucose uptake.

Thus, we hypothesized a role for AVP in the pathogenesis of PE. AVP infusion into pregnant C57BL/6J mice resulted in hypertension, renal glomerular endotheliosis, intrauterine growth restriction, decreased placental growth factor (PGF), altered placental morphology, placental oxidative stress, and placental gene expression consistent with human PE. Interestingly, these changes occurred despite a lack of placental hypoxia or elevations in placental fms-like  kinase-1 (FLT1). Coinfusion of AVP receptor antagonists and time-restricted infusion of AVP uncovered a mid-gestational role for the AVPR1A receptor in the observed renal pathologies, versus mid- and late-gestational roles for the AVPR2 receptor in the blood pressure and fetal phenotypes. These findings demonstrate that AVP is sufficient to initiate phenotypes of PE in the absence of placental hypoxia, and indicate that AVP may mechanistically (independently, and possibly synergistically with hypoxia) contribute to the development of clinical signs of PE in specific subtypes of human PE. Additionally, they identify divergent and gestational time-specific signaling mechanisms that mediate the development of PE phenotypes in response to AVP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29525218>Identification of caffeoylquinic acid derivatives as natural protein  phosphatase 1B inhibitors from Artemisia princeps.</a></h2><p>Considerable attention has been paid to protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibitors as a potential therapy for diabetes, , and cancer.

The growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6) protein is known to induce dynamic cellular responses and is elevated in PE. Gas6 binds to the AXL  kinase receptor and AXL-mediated signaling is implicated in proliferation and migration observed in several tissues. Our laboratory utilized Gas6 to induce preeclamptic-like conditions in pregnant rats. Our objective was to determine the role of Gas6/AXL signaling as a possible model of PE. Briefly, pregnant rats were divided into 3 groups that received daily intraperitoneal injections (from gestational day 7.5-17.5) of PBS, Gas6, or Gas6 + R428 (an AXL inhibitor administered from gestational day 13.5-17.5). Animals dispensed Gas6 experienced elevated blood pressure, increased proteinuria, augmented caspase-3 mediated placental apoptosis and diminished trophoblast invasion. Gas6 also enhanced expression of several PE related genes and a number of inflammatory mediators. Gas6 further enhanced placental oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial respiration. Each of these PE related characteristics were ameliorated in dams and/or their placentae when AXL inhibition by R428 occurred in tandem with Gas6 treatment. We conclude that Gas6 signaling is capable of inducing PE and that inhibition of AXL prevents disease progression in pregnant rats. These results provide insight into pathways associated with PE that could be useful in the clarification of potential therapeutic approaches.© The Author(s) 2019.

In skeletal muscle, chronic exposure to TNF-α impairs insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and insulin signaling. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of enzymatic egg white hydrolysate (EWH) and its responsible peptide, IRW, on TNF-α-induced insulin resistance and the underlying molecular mechanisms using rat skeletal muscle cells (L6 cells).Insulin resistance was induced by treating L6 cells with 5 ng/ml TNF-α for 24 h.

Model systems and human genetics support a role for IDOL in regulating circulating LDL levels. Whether IDOL plays a broader metabolic role and affects development of metabolic syndrome-associated comorbidities is unknown. Approach and Results- We studied WT (wild type) and Idol (Idol-KO) mice in 2 models: physiological aging and diet-induced . In both models, deletion of Idol protected mice from metabolic dysfunction. On a Western-type diet, Idol loss resulted in decreased circulating levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and insulin. This was accompanied by protection from weight gain in short- and long-term dietary challenges, which could be attributed to reduced hepatosteatosis and fat mass in Idol-KO mice. Although feeding and intestinal fat uptake were unchanged in Idol-KO mice, their brown adipose tissue was protected from lipid accumulation and had elevated expression of UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1) and TH ( hydroxylase). Indirect calorimetry indicated a marked increase in locomotion and suggested a trend toward increased cumulative energy expenditure and fat oxidation. An increase in in vivo clearance of reconstituted lipoprotein particles in Idol-KO mice may sustain this energetic demand. In the BXD mouse genetic reference population, hepatic Idol expression correlates with multiple metabolic parameters, thus providing support for findings in the Idol-KO mice. Conclusions- Our study uncovers an unrecognized role for Idol in regulation of whole body metabolism in physiological aging and on a Western-type diet. These findings support Idol inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to target multiple metabolic syndrome-associated comorbidities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625317>Leptin Signaling in the Arcuate Nucleus Reduces Insulin's Capacity to Suppress Hepatic Glucose Production in Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>Insulin action in the hypothalamus results in the suppression of hepatic glucose production (HGP).  is often associated with a diminished response to insulin, leading to impaired suppression of HGP in obese mice.

To identify associations of angiogenic factors with characteristics on individual and tissue level, subcutaneous white adipose tissue samples were taken from 45 children aged 0-9 years undergoing elective surgery. We measured the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEFGA), fibroblast growth factor 1 and 2 (FGF1, FGF2), angiopoietin 1 and 2 (ANGPT1, ANGPT2), TEK receptor  kinase (TEK), and von Willebrand factor (VWF). In addition, we determined the mean adipocyte size in histologic tissue sections. We found positive correlations of age with FGF1 and FGF2 and a negative correlation with ANGPT2, with pronounced differences in the first two years of life. FGF1, FGF2, and ANGPT1 correlated positively with adipocyte size. Furthermore, we identified a correlation of ANGPT1 and TEK with body mass index-standard deviation score (BMI-SDS), a measure to define childhood . Except for ANGPT2, all angiogenic factors correlated positively with the endothelial marker VWF. In sum, our findings suggest that differences related to BMI-SDS begin early in childhood, and the analyzed angiogenic factors possess distinct roles in adipose tissue biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29937240>Satiety and gastrointestinal hormones during a Mixed Meal Tolerance Test after gastric bypass surgery: association with plasma amino acid concentrations.</a></h2><p>Circulating amino acids have been associated with both appetite and the secretion of anorexigenic hormones in healthy and obese populations. This effect has not been investigated in subjects having undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB).To investigate the association between postprandial plasma concentrations of amino acids and the anorexigenic hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide   (PYY), the orexigenic hormone ghrelin, and satiety and hunger in post-RYGB subjects.A Dutch surgical department.Participants after primary RYGB were studied during a Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT). Satiety and hunger were assessed every 30 minutes on visual analogue scales. Blood samples were collected at baseline, every 10 minutes during the first half hour and every 30 minutes until 210 minutes after the start. The samples were assessed for 24 amino acids and 3 gastrointestinal hormones. Incremental areas under the curve (iAUCs) were calculated. Exploratory analyses were performed in which subjects were divided into high and low responders depending on the median iAUC.42 subjects, aged 48 ± 11 (mean ± SD) years, 31 to 76 months post-RYGB and with total weight loss of 30 ± 9% completed the MMTT. Subjects with high satiety scores had more than a 25% higher net iAUC of PYY and GLP-1 and at least a 10% higher net iAUC of 10 amino acids compared to subjects with low scores (P < 0.05). The net iAUC of five of these amino acids (i.e. arginine, asparagine, histidine, serine and threonine) was more than 10% higher in subjects with high responses on GLP-1 and/or PYY (P < 0.05).Certain postprandial amino acids were associated with satiety and anorexigenic hormones and could therefore play a role in appetite regulation after RYGB; either by a direct effect on satiety, indirectly through gastrointestinal hormones, or both.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Bariatric Surgery.

The impaired fat oxidation in  condition leads to increased hepatic fat accumulation and increased metabolic syndrome risk. On the other hand, physical exercise has been demonstrated as a potent strategy in the prevention of NAFLD. Also, these beneficial effects of exercise occur through different mechanisms. Recently, the Cdc2-like kinase (CLK2) protein was associated with the suppression of fatty acid oxidation and hepatic ketogenesis. Thus, obese animals demonstrated elevated levels of hepatic CLK2 and decreased fat acid oxidation. Here, we explored the effects of chronic physical exercise in the hepatic metabolism of obese mice. Swiss mice were distributed in Lean, Obese (fed with high-fat diet during 16 weeks) and Trained Obese group (fed with high-fat diet during 16 weeks and exercised (at 60% exhaustion velocity during 1 h/5 days/week) during 8 weeks. In our results, the obese animals showed insulin resistance, increased hepatic CLK2 content and increased hepatic fat accumulation compared to the Lean group. Otherwise, the chronic physical exercise improved insulin resistance state, prevented the increased CLK2 in the liver and attenuated hepatic fat accumulation. In summary, these data reveal a new protein involved in the prevention of hepatic fat accumulation after chronic physical exercise. More studies can evidence the negative role of CLK2 in the control of liver metabolism, contributing to the improvement of insulin resistance, , and type 2 diabetes.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826467>Reduced biliverdin reductase-A levels are associated with early alterations of insulin signaling in .</a></h2><p>Biliverdin reductase-A (BVR-A) is a serine/threonine/ kinase involved in the regulation of insulin signaling. In vitro studies have demonstrated that BVR-A is a substrate of the insulin receptor and regulates IRS1 by avoiding its aberrant activation, and in animal model of  the loss of hepatic BVR-A has been associated with glucose/insulin alterations and fatty liver disease.

We showed that BVR-A levels are significantly reduced in obese subjects and associated with a hyper-activation of the IR/IRS1/Akt/GSK-3β/AS160/GLUT4 pathway. Low BVR-A levels also associate with the presence of , metabolic syndrome, NASH and visceral adipose tissue inflammation.

However, its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the action mechanisms underlying the protective effects of UDCA and vitamin E against liver dysfunction using metabolomics and metagenomic analysis. In this study, we analysed blood and urine samples from patients with  and liver dysfunction. Nine patients were randomly assigned to receive UDCA (300 mg twice daily), and 10 subjects received vitamin E (400 IU twice daily) for 8 weeks. UDCA significantly improved the liver function scores after 4 weeks of treatment and effectively reduced hepatic deoxycholic acid and serum microRNA-122 levels. To better understand its protective mechanism, a global metabolomics study was conducted, and we found that UDCA regulated uremic toxins (hippuric acid, p-cresol sulphate, and indole-derived metabolites), antioxidants (ascorbate sulphate and N-acetyl-L-cysteine), and the phenylalanine/ pathway. Furthermore, microbiome involvement, particularly of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, was demonstrated through metagenomic analysis of bacteria-derived extracellular vesicles. Meanwhile, vitamin E treatment did not result in such alterations, except that it reduced uremic toxins and liver dysfunction. Our findings suggested that both treatments were effective in improving liver function, albeit via different mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30704618>Protein  phosphatase 1B inhibitory activities of ursane-type triterpenes from Chinese raspberry, fruits of Rubus chingii.</a></h2><p>Protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has led to an intense interest in developing its inhibitors as anti-diabetes, anti- and anti-cancer agents.

Therefore we have investigated bioactive compounds from marine organisms such as marine sponges, ascidians, and marine-derived microorganisms. This review consists of two topics based on marine natural product chemistry. (1) Protein  phosphatase (PTP) 1B plays a key role as a negative regulator in the insulin and leptin signaling pathways. Accordingly, the development of PTP1B inhibitors is expected to provide new drugs for type 2 diabetes and . We have been searching for new types of PTP1B inhibitors among marine organisms and identified various PTP1B inhibitors from marine sponges and fungi.

(2) In the course of our studies on the induced production of new fungal metabolites, the Palauan marine-derived fungus, Trichoderma cf. brevicompactum TPU199, was found to produce the unusual epipolythiodiketopiperazines, gliovirin and pretrichodermamide A. Long-term static fermentation of the strain induced production of a new dipeptide, dithioaspergillazine A, whereas fermentation of the strain with NaCl, NaBr, and NaI produced the Cl and Br derivatives of pretrichodermamide A and a new iodinated derivative, iododithiobrevamide, respectively. Moreover, DMSO-added seawater medium induced the production of diketopiperazine with the unprecedented trithio-bridge, chlorotrithiobrevamide.

Previous studies are mainly limited to middle age and focus on either fat or lean mass, thereby ignoring overall body composition. We investigated the associations of fat and lean body mass with circulating amino acids in older men and women. We studied 594 women and 476 men from the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study (age 62-74 years). Bioelectrical impedance analysis was used to indicate two main body compartments by fat (fat mass/height2) and lean mass indices (lean mass/height2), dichotomized based on sex-specific medians. Eight serum amino acids were quantified using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. General linear models were adjusted for age, smoking and fasting glucose. Higher lean mass index was associated with higher concentrations of branched-chain amino acids in both sexes (p≤0.001). In men, lean mass index was also positively associated with  (p=0.006) and inversely with glycine (p<0.001). Higher fat mass index was associated with higher concentrations of all branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine and ), and alanine in both sexes (p≤0.008). Associations between body composition and amino acids are largely similar in older men and women. The associations are largely similar to those previously observed in younger adults.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.

The goal of this study was to investigate whether there are sex differences in resistance training effects on metabolic alterations induced by monosodium glutamate (MSG), a model of , in male and female rats. Male and female Wistar rats received MSG (4 g/kg body weight/day, s.c.) from postnatal day 1 to 10. After 10 days from MSG administration, the rats were separated into two groups: MSG-sedentary and MSG-exercised. At postnatal day 60, the animals started a resistance training protocol in an 80 degrees inclined vertical ladder apparatus and performed it for 7 weeks. Control rats received saline solution and were divided in saline-sedentary and saline-exercised. Resistance training restored all plasma biochemical parameters (glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase) increased in male and female rats treated with MSG. The MSG administration induced hyperglycemia associated with a decrease in the skeletal muscle glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) levels and accompanied by deregulation in proteins, G-6Pase, and  aminotransferase, involved in hepatic glucose metabolism of male and female rats. MSG induced dyslipidemia and lipotoxicity in the liver and skeletal muscle of male rats. Regarding female rats, lipotoxicity was found only in the skeletal muscle. The resistance training had beneficial effects against metabolic alterations induced by MSG in male and female rats, through regulation of proteins (GLUT2, protein kinase B, and GLUT4) involved in glucose and lipid pathways in the liver and skeletal muscle.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31159256>Low-Dose Stevia (Rebaudioside A) Consumption Perturbs Gut Microbiota and the Mesolimbic Dopamine Reward System.</a></h2><p>Stevia is a natural low-calorie sweetener that is growing in popularity in food and beverage products. Despite its widespread use, little is understood of its impact on the gut microbiota, an important environmental factor that can mediate metabolism and subsequent  and disease risk. Furthermore, given previous reports of dysbiosis with some artificial low-calorie sweeteners, we wanted to understand whether prebiotic consumption could rescue potential stevia-mediated changes in gut microbiota. Three-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to consume: (1) Water (CTR); (2) Rebaudioside A (STV); (3) prebiotic (PRE); (4) Rebaudioside A + prebiotic (SP) ( = 8/group) for 9 weeks. Rebaudioside was added to drinking water and prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin added to control diet (10%). Body weight and feces were collected weekly and food and fluid intake biweekly. Oral glucose and insulin tolerance tests, gut permeability tests, dual X-ray absorptiometry, and tissue harvest were performed at age 12 weeks. Rebaudioside A consumption alone did not alter weight gain or glucose tolerance compared to CTR. Rebaudioside A did, however, alter gut microbiota composition and reduce nucleus accumbens  hydroxylase and dopamine transporter mRNA levels compared to CTR. Prebiotic animals, alone or with Rebaudioside A, had reduced fat mass, food intake, and gut permeability and cecal SCFA concentration. Adding Rebaudioside A did not interfere with the benefits of the prebiotic except for a significant reduction in cecal weight.

Increasing sleep duration may be an appropriate strategy to reduce cardiometabolic risk in short-sleeping individuals. The aim is to review the effects of sleep extension interventions on cardiometabolic risk in adults. The PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for relevant, English, peer-reviewed scientific publications (until August 2018). Seven studies that aimed to increase sleep duration in adults by any sleep extension intervention and described at least one cardiometabolic risk factor were included. These studies had a combined sample size of 138 participants who were either healthy (n = 14), healthy short-sleeping (n = 92), overweight short-sleeping (n = 10), or pre- or hypertensive short-sleeping (n = 22) individuals. The durations of the sleep extension interventions ranged from 3 days to 6 weeks, and all successfully increased total sleep time by between 21 and 177 min. Sleep extension was associated with improved direct and indirect measures of insulin sensitivity, decreased leptin and peptide -, and reductions in overall appetite, desire for sweet and salty foods, intake of daily free sugar, and percentage of daily caloric intake from protein.

DM has two types: type 1, which is often associated with a total destruction of pancreatic beta cells, and non-insulin-dependent or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), more closely associated with  and old age. The main causes of T2DM are insulin resistance and/or inadequate insulin secretion. Protein- phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) negatively regulates insulin signaling pathways and plays an important role in T2DM, as its overexpression may induce insulin resistance.

Hence, several marine organisms, including macro and microalgae, sponges, marine invertebrates, sea urchins, seaweeds, soft corals, lichens, and sea grasses, have been recently evaluated as potential drug sources. This review provides an overview of the role of PTP1B in T2DM insulin signaling and treatment, and highlights the recent findings of several compounds and extracts derived from marine organisms and their relevance as upcoming PTP1B inhibitors. In this systematic literature review, more than 60 marine-derived metabolites exhibiting PTP1B inhibitory activity are listed.

We tested the hypothesis that Astragaloside IV (As IV), known to counteract  and hypertension, could prevent -associated hypertension by inhibiting pro-inflammatory reaction and leptin resistance. High-fat diet (HFD) induced obese rats were randomly assigned to three groups: the HFD control group (HF con group), As IV group, and the As IV + α-bungaratoxin (α-BGT) group (As IV+α-BGT group). As IV (20 mg·Kg·d) was administrated to rats for 6 weeks via daily oral gavage. Body weight and blood pressure were continuously measured, and NE levels in the plasma and renal cortex was evaluated to reflect the sympathetic activity. The expressions of leptin receptor (LepRb) mRNA, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (p-STAT3), phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p-PI3K), suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) mRNA, and protein- phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) mRNA, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA and neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA were measured by Western blot or qRT-PCR to evaluate the hypothalamic leptin sensitivity. Additionally, we measured the protein or mRNA levels of α7nAChR, inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase subunit β/ nuclear factor κB (IKKβ/NF-KB) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) in hypothalamus and adipose tissue to reflect the anti-inflammatory effects of As IV through upregulating expression of α7nAChR. We found that As IV prevented body weight gain and adipose accumulation, and also improved metabolic disorders in HFD rats. Furthermore, As IV decreased BP and HR, as well as NE levels in blood and renal tissue. In the hypothalamus, As IV alleviated leptin resistance as evidenced by the increased p-STAT3, LepRb mRNA and POMC mRNA, and decreased p-PI3K, SOCS3 mRNA, and PTP1B mRNA. The effects of As IV on leptin sensitivity were related in part to the up-regulated α7nAchR and suppressed IKKβ/NF-KB signaling and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hypothalamus and adipose tissue, since co-administration of α7nAChR selective antagonist α-BGT could weaken the improved effect of As IV on central leptin resistance. Our study suggested that As IV could efficiently prevent -associated hypertension through inhibiting inflammatory reaction and improving leptin resistance; furthermore, these effects of As IV was partly related to the increased α7nAchR expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30184485>The MIC-1/GDF15-GFRAL Pathway in Energy Homeostasis: Implications for , Cachexia, and Other Associated Diseases.</a></h2><p>MIC-1/GDF15 is a stress response cytokine and a distant member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) superfamily, with no close relatives. It acts via a recently identified receptor called glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) receptor alpha-like (GFRAL), which is a distant orphan member of the GDNF receptor family that signals through the  kinase receptor Ret. MIC-1/GDF15 expression and serum levels rise in response to many stimuli that initiate cell stress and as part of a wide variety of disease processes, most prominently cancer and cardiovascular disease. The best documented actions of MIC-1/GDF15 are on regulation of energy homeostasis. When MIC-1/GDF15 serum levels are substantially elevated in diseases like cancer, it subverts a physiological pathway of appetite regulation to induce an anorexia/cachexia syndrome initiated by its actions on hindbrain neurons.

In this report, we set out to establish the respective roles of MCH and conventional neurotransmitters in these neurons.MCH neurons were profiled using Cre-dependent molecular profiling technologies (vTRAP). MCHCre mice crossed to Vglut2mice or to DTRwere used to identify the role of glutamate in MCH neurons. We assessed metabolic parameters such as body composition, glucose tolerance, or sucrose preference.We found that nearly all MCH neurons in the LH are glutamatergic and that a loss of glutamatergic signaling from MCH neurons from a glutamate transporter (VGlut2) knockout leads to a reduced weight, hypophagia and hyperkinetic behavior with improved glucose tolerance and a loss of sucrose preference. These effects are indistinguishable from those seen after ablation of MCH neurons. These findings are in contrast to those seen in mice with a knockout of the MCH neuropeptide, which show normal glucose preference and do not have improved glucose tolerance.Overall, these data show that the vast majority of MCH neurons are glutamatergic, and that glutamate and MCH signaling mediate partially overlapping functions by these neurons, presumably by activating partially overlapping postsynaptic populations. The diverse functional effects of MCH neurons are thus mediated by a composite of glutamate and MCH signaling.Published by Elsevier GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29712668>TCPTP Regulates Insulin Signaling in AgRP Neurons to Coordinate Glucose Metabolism With Feeding.</a></h2><p>Insulin regulates glucose metabolism by eliciting effects on peripheral tissues as well as the brain. Insulin receptor (IR) signaling inhibits AgRP-expressing neurons in the hypothalamus to contribute to the suppression of hepatic glucose production (HGP) by insulin, whereas AgRP neuronal activation attenuates brown adipose tissue (BAT) glucose uptake. The  phosphatase TCPTP suppresses IR signaling in AgRP neurons. Hypothalamic TCPTP is induced by fasting and degraded after feeding. Here we assessed the influence of TCPTP in AgRP neurons in the control of glucose metabolism. TCPTP deletion in AgRP neurons (-Cre; ) enhanced insulin sensitivity, as assessed by the increased glucose infusion rates, and reduced HGP during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, accompanied by increased [C]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake in BAT and browned white adipose tissue. TCPTP deficiency in AgRP neurons promoted the intracerebroventricular insulin-induced repression of hepatic gluconeogenesis in otherwise unresponsive food-restricted mice, yet had no effect in fed/satiated mice where hypothalamic TCPTP levels are reduced. The improvement in glucose homeostasis in -Cre; mice was corrected by IR heterozygosity (-Cre; ; ), causally linking the effects on glucose metabolism with the IR signaling in AgRP neurons. Our findings demonstrate that TCPTP controls IR signaling in AgRP neurons to coordinate HGP and brown/beige adipocyte glucose uptake in response to feeding/fasting.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161683>Impairment of sperm maturation and capacitation due to diet-dependent cholesterol overload.</a></h2><p>Lipid metabolic disorders (dyslipidemia) are constantly increasing in occidental societies and lead to the development of pathologies such as , diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. It has been demonstrated that dyslipidemia can alter the reproductive function. Animal models have recently been used to show that the offspring of dyslipidemic males could also develop such pathologies and that the transgenerational transmission involved post-testicular sperm maturation. These data targeted the essential role of male gamete epididymal maturation and its importance for the health of the offspring.This publication summarizes in the first place experimental data obtained using a mouse model of dyslipidemia-induced post-testicular infertility, knockout mice for the two isoforms of the 'Liver X Receptors' (Lxrα;β ), the major regulators of cholesterol homeostasis. The impact of a high cholesterol diet (HCD) on the protein YWHAZ (14-3-3 ζ or  3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein Zeta) was also investigated in our model.In our mouse model, when young fertile Lxrα;β males aged three months were fed four weeks with a HCD, they developed an epididymal phenotype leading to infertility. The level of sperm YWHAZ was evaluated by Western blot and its  phosphorylation state by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot.Our data revealed that sperm lipid composition and structure were altered, leading to defects of the capacitation-associated signaling pathway. They also showed that both the level and the  phosphorylation state of YWHAZ were affected by the HCD in sperm cells from Lxrα;β males.YWHAZ could be a new important regulator of capacitation-associated  phosphorylation and a marker of dyslipidemia-induced infertility.© 2019 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31136297>Implementation of a novel self-induced promoter for the expression of pharmaceutical peptides in Escherichia coli: YY(3-36) peptide.</a></h2><p>Background Increasing the expression rate of recombinant mammalian hormones in Escherichia coli by combining efficient promoters and signal sequences is a never ending process. A self-induced promoter will have some beneficial gains compared to the classical T7 promoter or its variants with isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) as the inducer.  is the prime suspect in widespread frequency of diabetes type II and cardiovascular diseases worldwide. YY (-) peptide is a local acting hormone, controlling appetite. Excitingly, it was has been shown that a truncated version of the YY peptide, YY(3-36) peptide, has potential as a worthy biopharmaceutical agent in the fight against . Materials and methods To develop an economical expression system for the large scale production of the peptide in Gram-negative bacteria, we introduced a promoter sequence upstream of a chimeric gene for the extracellular expression of this peptide with the assistance of a signal sequence of asparaginase II from E. coli. This system has the advantage of producing a complete sequence of a truncated YY peptide, YY(3-36), without any extra tags that would require further removal with the assistance of expensive specific proteases and reduced the downstream steps, significantly. Results Recombinant production of YY(3-36) peptide under a self-induced promoter proves the efficacy of the asparaginase II signal sequence as a communicator of foreign peptides and proteins into the extracellular space of E. coli. Conclusions The application of fusion protein expression of biopharmaceuticals, especially mammalian hormones, in prokaryotic systems with the help of native signal sequences makes some common tags with expensive proteases for the removal of the attached protein Tag redundant.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30269370>Novel leptin receptor signaling mutants identify location and sex-dependent modulation of bone density, adiposity, and growth.</a></h2><p>Leptin, a hormone primarily produced by adipocytes, contributes to the regulation of bone health by modulating bone density, growth and adiposity. Upon leptin binding, multiple sites of the long form of the leptin receptor (LepRb) are phosphorylated to trigger activation of downstream signaling pathways. To address the role of LepRb-signaling pathways in bone health, we compared the effects of three LepRb mutations on bone density, adiposity, and growth in male and female mice. The ∆65 mutation, which lacks the known  phosphorylation sites, caused  and the most dramatic bone phenotype marked by excessive bone adiposity, osteoporosis, and decreased growth, consistent with the phenotype of db/db and ob/ob mice that fully lack leptin receptor signaling. Mutation of LepRb Tyr  , which results in an inability to recruit and phosphorylate signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, also caused , but bone loss and adiposity were more dominant in male mice and no growth defect was observed. In contrast, mutation of LepRb Tyr  , which blocks SHP2/SOCS3 recruitment to LepRb and contributes to leptin hypersensitivity, promoted increased femur bone density only in male mice, while marrow adiposity and bone growth were not affected. Additional analyses of vertebral trabecular bone volume indicate that only the Tyr  mutant mice exhibit bone loss in vertebrae. Together, our findings suggest that the phosphorylation status of specific sites of the LepRb contribute to the sex- and location-dependent bone responses to leptin. Unraveling the mechanisms by which leptin responses are sex- and location-dependent can contribute to the development of uniquely targeted osteoporosis therapies.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30611982>Investigation of stereoisomeric bisarylethenesulfonic acid esters for discovering potent and selective PTP1B inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has been considered as a promising therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and  due to its key regulating effects in insulin signaling and leptin receptor pathways. In this work, a series of cis- and trans-pyrrolidine bisarylethenesulfonic acid esters were prepared and their PTP1B inhibitory potency, selectivity and membrane permeability were evaluated. These novel stereoisomeric molecules especially trans-isomers exhibited remarkable inhibitory activity, significant selectivity as well as good membrane permeability (e.g. compound 28a, IC = 120, 1940 and 2670 nM against PTP1B, TCPTP and SHP2 respectively, and P = 1.74 × 10 cm/s). Molecular simulations indicated that trans-pyrrolidine bisarylethenesulfonic acid esters yielded the stronger binding affinity than their cis-isomers by constructing more interactions with non-catalytic sites of PTP1B.

GUCY2C mRNA and protein are produced in the hypothalamus, a major center regulating appetite and metabolic homeostasis. Further, GUCY2C mRNA and protein are expressed in the ventral midbrain, a principal structure regulating hedonic reward from behaviors including eating. While GUCY2C is expressed in hypothalamus and midbrain, its precise neuroanatomical organization and relationship with circuits regulating satiety remain unknown. Here, we reveal that hypothalamic GUCY2C mRNA is confined to the ventral premammillary nucleus (PMV), while in midbrain it is produced by neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN). GUCY2C in the PMV is produced by 46% of neurons expressing anorexigenic leptin receptors, while in the VTA/SN it is produced in most  hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons. In contrast to mRNA, GUCY2C protein is widely distributed throughout the brain in canonical sites of PMV and VTA/SN axonal projections. Selective stereotaxic ablation of PMV or VTA/SN neurons eliminated GUCY2C only in their respective canonical projection sites. Conversely, specific anterograde tracer analyses of PMV or VTA/SN neurons confirmed distinct GUCY2C-immunoreactive axons projecting to those canonical locations. Together, these findings reveal two discrete neuronal circuits expressing GUCY2C originating in the PMV in the hypothalamus and in the VTA/SN in midbrain, which separately project to other sites throughout the brain. They suggest a structural basis for a role for the GUCY2C-uroguanylin gut-brain endocrine axis in regulating homeostatic and behavioral components contributing to satiety.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31165976>Alterations of Gut Microbiota After Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch in Wistar Rats.</a></h2><p>The biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS) represents the most effective surgical procedure for the treatment of severe  and associated type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms whereby BPD/DS exerts its positive metabolic effects have however yet to be fully delineated. The objective of this study was to distinguish the effects of the two components of BPD/DS, namely the sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and the DS derivation, on gut microbiota, and to appraise whether changes in microbial composition are linked with surgery-induced metabolic benefits.BPD/DS, DS, and SG were performed in Wistar rats fed a standard chow diet. Body weight and energy intake were measured daily during 8 weeks post-surgery, at which time glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide   (PYY), insulin, and glucose were measured. Fecal samples were collected prior to surgery and at 2 and 8 weeks post-surgery. Intraluminal contents of the alimentary, biliopancreatic, and common limbs (resulting from BPD/DS) were taken from the proximal portion of each limb. Fecal and small intestinal limb samples were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.BPD/DS and DS led to lower digestible energy intake (P = 0.0007 and P = 0.0002, respectively), reduced weight gain (P < 0.0001) and body fat mass (P < 0.0001), improved glucose metabolism, and increased GLP-1 (P = 0.0437, SHAM versus DS) and PYY levels (P < 0.0001). These effects were associated with major alterations of both the fecal and small intestinal microbiota, as revealed by significant decrease in bacterial richness and diversity at 2 (P < 0.0001, Chao1 index; P < 0.0001, Shannon index) and 8 weeks (P = 0.0159, SHAM versus DS, Chao1 index; P = 0.0219, SHAM versus DS, P = 0.0472, SHAM versus BPD/DS, Shannon index) post-surgery in BPD/DS and DS, and increased proportions of Bifidobacteriales (a 60% increase in both groups) but reduced Clostridiales (a 50% decrease and a 90% decrease respectively), which were mostly accounted at the genus level by higher relative abundance of Bifidobacterium in both the fecal and intestinal limb samples, as well as reduced abundance of Peptostreptococcaceae and Clostridiaceae in the small intestine. Those effects were not seen in SG rats.The metabolic benefits following BPD/DS are seemingly due to the DS component of the surgery. Furthermore, BPD/DS causes marked alterations in fecal and small intestinal microbiota resulting in reduced bacterial diversity and richness. Our data further suggest that increased abundance of Bifidobacterium and reduced level of two Clostridiales species in the gut microbiota might contribute to the positive metabolic outcomes of BPD/DS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31339082>Protein  Phosphatase (PTP1B): A promising Drug Target against life threatening ailments.</a></h2><p>Protein  phosphatases are enzymes which help in signal transduction in diabetes, , cancer, liver diseases and neurodegenerative diseases.

Although often expressed as an increase in insulin concentration, the disease is characterized by a decrease in insulin action. This increased workload of the pancreas and the consequent decompensation are not only the main mechanisms for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but also exacerbate the damage of metabolic diseases, including , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, metabolic syndrome, and others. Many clinical trials have suggested the potential role of herbs in the treatment of insulin resistance, although most of the clinical trials included in this review have certain flaws and bias risks in their methodological design, including the generation of randomization, the concealment of allocation, blinding, and inadequate reporting of sample size estimates. These studies involve not only the single-flavored herbs, but also herbal formulas, extracts, and active ingredients. Numerous of  and  studies have pointed out that the role of herbal medicine in improving insulin resistance is related to interventions in various aspects of the insulin signaling pathway. The targets involved in these studies include insulin receptor substrate, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, glucose transporter, AMP-activated protein kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3, mitogen-activated protein kinases, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase, nuclear factor-kappaB, protein  phosphatase 1B, nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors.

The current study further evaluated the effects and possible mechanisms of QGZST on epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) dysfunction in a high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed-spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model. Results showed that QGZST significantly decreased the systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), body weights and adipocyte size of HFD-fed SHRs. Moreover, QGZST remarkably reduced the serum levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR index, increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and improved glucose intolerance in HFD-fed SHRs. Furthermore, QGZST dramatically attenuated HFD-fed-induced hypersecretion of proinflammatory cytokines and hypoproduction of adiponectin in SHRs. Mechanistically, QGZST stimulated the activity of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and suppress the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins-α(C/EBP-α), fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), acetylated nuclear factor-kappa-B-p65 (acetyl-NF-кB-p65) and protein- phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). More than that, QGZST also prevented acetyl-NF-кB-p65 nuclear accumulation. Collectively, our research demonstrated for the first time that QGZST is able to alleviate eWAT dysfunction with up-regulation of SIRT1 in HFD-fed SHRs, which might supply further insight into QGZST-mediated anti-hypertension and anti- effects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The protein⁻protein interaction (PPI) network was settled and analyzed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database constructed by Cytoscape software. Modules were extracted and identified by the PEWCC1 plugin. The microRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs) which control the expression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the NetworkAnalyst algorithm. A database (GSE73108) was downloaded from the GEO databases. Our results identified 873 DEGs (435 up-regulated and 438 down-regulated) genetically associated with insulin resistance. The pathways which were enriched were pathways in complement and coagulation cascades and complement activation for up-regulated DEGs, while biosynthesis of amino acids and the Notch signaling pathway were among the down-regulated DEGs. Showing GO enrichment were cardiac muscle cell⁻cardiac muscle cell adhesion and microvillus membrane for up-regulated DEGs and negative regulation of osteoblast differentiation and dendrites for down-regulated DEGs. Subsequently, myosin VB (MYO5B), discs, large homolog 2(DLG2), axin 2 (AXIN2), protein  kinase 7 (PTK7), Notch homolog 1 (NOTCH1), androgen receptor (AR), cyclin D1 (CCND1) and Rho family GTPase 3 (RND3) were diagnosed as the top hub genes in the up- and down-regulated PPI network and modules.

In this study we have investigated the hypothesis that consumption of a specially-formulated composition of essential amino acids (HiEAAs) can overcome anabolic resistance in individuals with heart failure and stimulate the net gain of body protein to a greater extent than a commercially popular protein-based meal replacement beverage with greater caloric but lower essential amino acid (EAA) content (LoEAA). A randomized cross-over design was used. Protein kinetics were determined using primed continuous infusions of L-(H)phenylalanine and L-(H) in the basal state and for four hours following consumption of either beverage. Both beverages induced positive net protein balance (i.e., anabolic response). However, the anabolic response was more than two times greater with the HiEAA than the LoEAA ( < 0.001), largely through a greater suppression of protein breakdown ( < 0.001). Net protein accretion (g) was also greater in the HiEAA when data were normalized for either amino acid or caloric content ( < 0.001). We conclude that a properly formulated EAA mixture can elicit a greater anabolic response in individuals with heart failure than a protein-based meal replacement. Since heart failure is often associated with , the minimal caloric value of the HiEAA formulation is advantageous.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451955>In silico investigations on the binding efficacy and allosteric mechanism of six different natural product compounds towards PTP1B inhibition through docking and molecular dynamics simulations.</a></h2><p>Protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a major negative regulator of both the insulin and leptin receptor phosphorylation which impacts insulin sensitivity and hence is a major therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and . Identification of PTP1B active site inhibitors has proven to be difficult with none of them clearing the phase II clinical trials. Since the conventional methods of targeting the active site of PTP1B have failed to bring out effective PTP1B inhibitors as potential drugs, recent studies are focussing on identification of potential allosteric inhibitors of PTP1B with better specificity and activity. A complete understanding of the molecular features dynamically involved for allosteric site inhibition is still uncertain, and hence, this study is aimed at evaluating the allosteric effectiveness of six natural compounds isolated from medicinal plants which showed in vitro antidiabetic activity along with PTP1B inhibition. The allosteric binding and inhibition of these compounds are studied using computational methods such as molecular docking, homology modelling and molecular dynamics simulations for a timescale of 100 ns. The molecular dynamics simulations of native PTP1B, along with the modelled allosteric α-7 helix, for a timescale of 100 ns, revealed the spontaneous transition of the native PTP1B from open WPD loop (active) to closed WPD loop (inactive) conformations during the simulations. Similar dynamics was observed in the presence of the active site substrate pTyr (phosphotyrosine), whereas this transition was inhibited in the presence of the compounds at the allosteric site. Results of molecular dynamics simulations and principal component analysis reveal that the hindrance to WPD loop was mediated through structural interactions between the allosteric α-helical triad with Loop11 and WPD loop. The MM-PBSA (Molecular Mechanics - Poisson Boltzmann with Surface Area solvation) binding energy results along with H-bonding analysis show the possible allosteric inhibition of Aloe emodin glycoside (AEG), 3β-taraxerol (3BT), chlorogenic acid (CGA) and cichoric acid (CHA) to be higher in comparison with (3β)-stigmast-5-en-3-ol (SGS) and methyl lignocerate (MLG). The interaction analysis was further validated by scoring the allosteric complexes before and after MD simulations using Glide. These findings on spontaneous PTP1B fluctuations and the allosteric interactions provide a better insight into the role of PTP1B fluctuations in impacting the binding energy of allosteric inhibitors towards optimal drug designing for PTP1B.

The subjects underwent a physical examination and provided a clinical history and a blood sample for biochemical, hormonal and amino acid analyses. The women had higher levels of arginine, aspartate and serine and lower levels of α-aminoadipic acid, cysteine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, proline, tryptophan, , urea and valine than the men. The obese subjects had higher levels of alanine, aspartate, cysteine, ornithine, phenylalanine, proline and  and lower levels of glycine, ornithine and serine than the normal weight subjects.

This is unique relative to white adipose tissue (WAT), which is generally more attuned to metabolic demand. It suggests that there may be regulatory pathways that are common to both BMAT and WAT and also those that are specific to BMAT alone. The central nervous system (CNS) is a key mediator of adipose tissue function through sympathetic adrenergic neurons. Thus, we hypothesized that central autonomic pathways may be involved in BMAT regulation. To test this, we first quantified the innervation of BMAT by  hydroxylase (TH) positive nerves within the metaphysis and diaphysis of the tibia of B6 and C3H mice. We found that many of the TH+ axons were concentrated around central blood vessels in the bone marrow. However, there were also areas of free nerve endings which terminated in regions of BMAT adipocytes. Overall, the proportion of nerve-associated BMAT adipocytes increased from proximal to distal along the length of the tibia (from ~3-5 to ~14-24%), regardless of mouse strain. To identify the central pathways involved in BMAT innervation and compare to peripheral WAT, we then performed retrograde viral tract tracing with an attenuated pseudorabies virus (PRV) to infect efferent nerves from the tibial metaphysis (inclusive of BMAT) and inguinal WAT (iWAT) of C3H mice. PRV positive neurons were identified consistently from both injection sites in the intermediolateral horn of the spinal cord, reticular formation, rostroventral medulla, solitary tract, periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus, subcoeruleus, Barrington's nucleus, and hypothalamus. We also observed dual-PRV infected neurons within the majority of these regions. Similar tracings were observed in pons, midbrain, and hypothalamic regions from B6 femur and tibia, demonstrating that these results persist across mouse strains and between skeletal sites. Altogether, this is the first quantitative report of BMAT autonomic innervation and reveals common central neuroanatomic pathways, including putative "command" neurons, involved in coordinating multiple aspects of sympathetic output and facilitation of parallel processing between bone marrow/BMAT and peripheral adipose tissue.Copyright © 2019 Wee, Lorenz, Bekirov, Jacquin and Scheller.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29934339>FTO mediates cell-autonomous effects on adipogenesis and adipocyte lipid content by regulating gene expression via 6mA DNA modifications.</a></h2><p>SNPs in the first intron of α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase () convey effects on adiposity by mechanisms that remain unclear, but appear to include modulation of expression of  itself, as well as other genes in  expression is lower in fibroblasts and iPSC-derived neurons of individuals segregating for   risk alleles.

To understand the role of FGF21 in regulating tumor aggressiveness in thyroid cancer, serum levels of FGF21 were measured in healthy subjects and patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), and expression levels of FGF21, FGF receptors (FGFRs), and β-klotho (KLB) were investigated in human thyroid tissues. The cell viability, migrating cells, and invading cells were measured in PTC cells after treatment with recombinant FGF21. Higher serum levels of FGF21 were found in patients with thyroid cancer than in control participants, and were significantly associated with body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose levels, triglyceride levels, tumor stage, lymphovascular invasion, and recurrence. Serum FGF21 levels were positively correlated with the BMI in patients with PTC, and significantly associated with recurrence. Recombinant FGF21 led to tumor aggressiveness via activation of the FGFR signaling axis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling in PTC cells, and AZD4547, an FGFR  kinase inhibitor, attenuated the effects of FGF21. Hence, FGF21 may be a new biomarker for predicting tumor progression, and targeting FGFR may be a novel therapy for the treatment of obese patients with PTC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480505>Flavonoids and Their Anti-Diabetic Effects: Cellular Mechanisms and Effects to Improve Blood Sugar Levels.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevailing global health metabolic disorder, with an alarming incidence rate and a huge burden on health care providers. DM is characterized by the elevation of blood glucose due either to a defect in insulin synthesis, secretion, binding to receptor, or an increase of insulin resistance. The internal and external factors such as , urbanizations, and genetic mutations could increase the risk of developing DM. Flavonoids are phenolic compounds existing as secondary metabolites in fruits and vegetables as well as fungi. Their structure consists of 15 carbon skeletons and two aromatic rings (A and B) connected by three carbon chains. Flavonoids are furtherly classified into 6 subclasses: flavonols, flavones, flavanones, isoflavones, flavanols, and anthocyanidins. Naturally occurring flavonoids possess anti-diabetic effects. As in vitro and animal model's studies demonstrate, they have the ability to prevent diabetes and its complications. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge addressing the antidiabetic effects of dietary flavonoids and their underlying molecular mechanisms on selected pathways: Glucose transporter, hepatic enzymes,  kinase inhibitor, AMPK, PPAR, and NF-κB. Flavonoids improve the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications through the regulation of glucose metabolism, hepatic enzymes activities, and a lipid profile. Most studies illustrate a positive role of specific dietary flavonoids on diabetes, but the mechanisms of action and the side effects need more clarification. Overall, more research is needed to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of diabetes treatment using flavonoids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660449>Dietary Exposure to Transgenic Rice Expressing the Spider Silk Protein Fibroin Reduces Blood Glucose Levels in Diabetic Mice: The Potential Role of Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 Phosphorylation in Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by insulin resistance (IR). T2DM is correlated with  and most T2DM medications have been developed for enhancing insulin sensitivity. Silk protein fibroin (SPF) from spiders has been suggested as an attractive biomaterial for medical purposes. We generated transgenic rice (TR) expressing SPF and fed it to diabetic BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr mice to monitor the changes in blood glucose levels and adipose tissue proteins associated with energy metabolism and insulin signaling. In the present study, the adipocyte size in abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice was remarkably smaller than that of the control. Whereas the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated protein kinase and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein levels were increased in abdominal adipose tissues after TR-SPF feeding, levels of six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) proteins decreased. Phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 and IRS1 at serine 307 and  632 were both increased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice. Increased expression and phosphorylation of IRS1 at both serine 307 and  632 in adipose tissues indicated that adipocytes obtained from abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice were more susceptible to insulin signaling than that of the control. STAMP2 protein levels decreased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice, indicating that STAMP2 proteins were reducing adipocytes that were undergoing lipolysis. Taken together, this study showed that TR-SPF was effective in reducing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and that concurrent lipolysis in abdominal adipocytes was associated with alterations of AMPK, IRS1, and STAMP2. Increased IRS1 expression and its phosphorylation by TR-SFP were considered to be particularly important in the induction of lipolysis in adipocytes, as well as in reducing blood glucose levels in this animal model.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298844>An Isoform-Selective PTP1B Inhibitor Derived from Nitrogen-Atom Augmentation of Radicicol.</a></h2><p>A library of natural products and their derivatives was screened for inhibition of protein  phosphatase (PTP) 1B, which is a validated drug target for the treatment of  and type II diabetes.

Here, we demonstrate that combined pharmacologic inhibition of DYRK1A and transforming growth factor beta superfamily (TGFβSF)/SMAD signaling generates remarkable further synergistic increases in human beta cell proliferation (average labeling index, 5%-8%, and as high as 15%-18%), and increases in both mouse and human beta cell numbers. This synergy reflects activation of cyclins and cdks by DYRK1A inhibition, accompanied by simultaneous reductions in key cell-cycle inhibitors (CDKN1C and CDKN1A). The latter results from interference with the basal Trithorax- and SMAD-mediated transactivation of CDKN1C and CDKN1A. Notably, combined DYRK1A and TGFβ inhibition allows preservation of beta cell differentiated function. These beneficial effects extend from normal human beta cells and stem cell-derived human beta cells to those from people with type 2 diabetes, and occur both in vitro and in vivo.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Ninety percent of the diabetic population suffers from type-2 diabetes, which still needs an effective, safe and economical oral hypoglycemic therapy. Plants are rich sources of various therapeutic molecules. More than 400 medicinal plants of interesting phytochemical diversity have been reported for their antidiabetic potential. Naphthoquinones are a group of phytochemicals, which have a wide range of pharmacological potential, including antidiabetic activity. Naphthoquinones exert their antidiabetic effects through various mechanisms such as the inhibition of α-glucosidase and protein  phosphatase 1B, increased glucose uptake in myocytes and adipocytes via glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and GLUT2 translocations, enhanced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) ligand activity, and by normalizing carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes in the liver. Moreover, naphthoquinone inhibits adipogenesis by both upstream and downstream regulation to control , which is one of the important risk factors for diabetes. Naturally occurring naphthoquinones, as well as their plant sources, are therefore of interest for exploring their antidiabetic potential.

MKPs provide a mechanism of spatiotemporal feedback control of these key signalling pathways, but can also mediate crosstalk between distinct MAP kinase cascades and facilitate interactions between MAP kinase pathways and other key signalling modules. As our knowledge of the regulation, substrate specificity and catalytic mechanisms of MKPs has matured, more recent work using genetic models has revealed key physiological functions for MKPs and also uncovered potentially important roles in regulating the pathophysiological outcome of signalling with relevance to human diseases. These include cancer, diabetes, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. It is hoped that this understanding will reveal novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers for disease, thus contributing to more effective diagnosis and treatment for these debilitating and often fatal conditions.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Pursuing our efforts to identify PTP1B inhibitors endowed with drug-like properties, we designed and evaluated 3-aryl-5-arylidene-2-thioxo-4-imidazolidinones (7) as a novel class of non-carboxylate PTP1B inhibitors. In agreement with our design, kinetic studies demonstrated that selected compounds 7 act as reversible, non-competitive inhibitors of the target enzyme at low micromolar concentrations. Accordingly, molecular docking experiments suggested that these inhibitors can fit an allosteric site of PTP1B that we previously individuated. Moreover, cellular assays demonstrated that compound 7e acts as a potent insulin-sensitizing agent in human liver HepG2 cells.

However, the mechanism underlying the selectivity of PTP1B inhibitors against T-cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP) remains controversial, which is due to the high similarity between PTP1B and TCPTP sequence and the fact that no ligand-protein complex of TCPTP has been established yet. Here, the accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) method was used to investigate the structural dynamics of PTP1B and TCPTP that are bound by two chemically similar inhibitors with distinct selectivity. The conformational transitions during the "open" to "close" states of four complexes were captured, and free energy profiles of important residue pairs were analyzed in detail. Additional MM-PBSA calculations confirmed that the binding free energies of final states were consistent with the experimental results, and the energetic contributions of important residues were further investigated by alanine scanning mutagenesis. By comparing the four complexes, the different conformational behavior of WPD-loop, R-loop, and the second pTyr binding site induced by inhibitors were featured and found to be crucial for the selectivity of inhibitors. This study provides new mechanistic insights of specific binding of inhibitors to PTP1B and TCPTP, which can be exploited to the further structural-based inhibitor design.

Although RTT has been associated with , the underlying mechanism has not yet been elucidated. In this study, female heterozygous Mecp2-null mice (Mecp2+/- mice), a model of RTT, were fed a normal chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD), and the changes in molecular signaling pathways were investigated. Specifically, we examined the expression of genes related to the hypothalamus and dopamine reward circuitry, which represent a central network of feeding behavior control. In particular, dopamine reward circuitry has been shown to regulate hedonic feeding behavior, and its disruption is associated with HFD-related changes in palatability. The Mecp2+/- mice that were fed the normal chow showed normal body weight and food consumption, whereas those fed the HFD showed extreme  with hyperphagia, an increase of body fat mass, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance compared with wild-type mice fed the HFD (WT-HFD mice). The main cause of  in Mecp2+/--HFD mice was a remarkable increase in calorie intake, with no difference in oxygen consumption or locomotor activity. Agouti-related peptide mRNA and protein levels were increased, whereas proopiomelanocortin mRNA and protein levels were reduced in Mecp2+/--HFD mice with hyperleptinemia, which play an essential role in appetite and satiety in the hypothalamus. The conditioned place preference test revealed that Mecp2+/- mice preferred the HFD.  hydroxylase and dopamine transporter mRNA levels in the ventral tegmental area, and dopamine receptor and dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein mRNA levels in the nucleus accumbens were significantly lower in Mecp2+/--HFD mice than those of WT-HFD mice. Thus, HFD feeding induced dysregulation of food intake in the hypothalamus and dopamine reward circuitry, and accelerated the development of extreme  associated with addiction-like eating behavior in Mecp2+/- mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31053959>Sex and puberty-related differences in metabolomic profiles associated with adiposity measures in youth with .</a></h2><p>Specific patterns of metabolomic profiles relating to cardiometabolic disease are associated with increased weight in adults.

This study aimed to evaluate the expression of both  hydroxylase (TH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and CA content along preadipocytes differentiation, under normal and obesigenic conditions.8-9 week-old male C57BL/6 mice were divided in two groups: one fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) and other with a standard diet (SD) for 20 weeks. Afterwards, both TH and PNMT expression, localization, and CA content in adipocytes, were evaluated.qPCR results showed no changes for TH and PNMT expression during the differentiation process for visceral and subcutaneous preadipocytes from mice fed with SD.

One major complication of AMA is hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). While clinical investigations into human AMA have been reported, there has been limited information obtained from basic research. In this investigation, we established the AMA mouse model using aged pregnant ICR mice. We demonstrated that the phenotypes of aged pregnant ICR mice reflect the same characteristics as human AMA. The significant findings of our investigation are as follows: (1) The AMA mouse model manifested the same complication phenotypes of human AMA, including maternal , declining fertility, small for gestational age, and a higher rate of intrauterine fetal death; (2) The AMA mouse model exhibited an increasing systolic blood pressure at late gestation (108.2 ± 7.7 vs. 92.7 ± 5.7 mmHg, P < 0.01) that normalized after delivery similar to human HDP patients; and (3) While HDP and placental dysfunction are complicated, AMA mice and human HDP AMA patients manifested a low serum soluble fms-like  kinase-1 (sFlt-1) level in late gestation (AMA group vs. control group, mice, 16800.0 ± 10709.5 vs. 26611.9 ± 8702.0 pg/mL, respectively, P < 0.01; human, 8507.6 ± 3298.7 vs. 14816.9 ± 5413.5 pg/mL, respectively, P < 0.05). In conclusion, the aged pregnant mouse model resembled human AMA. The AMA mouse model was complicated with HDP despite the low serum sFlt-1 level. Our findings provide evidence that the serum sFlt-1 level does not necessarily reflect the conventional pathogenesis of HDP in aged human and murine pregnancies and may contribute to the future management of HDP in AMA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30158241>Celastrol-Induced Weight Loss Is Driven by Hypophagia and Independent From UCP1.</a></h2><p>Celastrol, a plant-derived constituent of traditional Chinese medicine, has been proposed to offer significant potential as an antiobesity drug. However, the molecular mechanism for this activity is unknown. We show that the weight-lowering effects of celastrol are driven by decreased food consumption. Although young Lep  mice respond with a decrease in food intake and body weight, adult Lep  and Lep  mice are unresponsive to celastrol, suggesting that functional leptin signaling in adult mice is required to elicit celastrol's catabolic actions. Protein  phosphatase 1 (PTP1B), a leptin negative-feedback regulator, has been previously reported to be one of celastrol's targets. However, we found that global PTP1B knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice have comparable weight loss and hypophagia when treated with celastrol. Increased levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in subcutaneous white and brown adipose tissue suggest celastrol-induced thermogenesis as a further mechanism. However, diet-induced obese UCP1 WT and KO mice have comparable weight loss upon celastrol treatment, and celastrol treatment has no effect on energy expenditure under ambient housing or thermoneutral conditions. Overall, our results suggest that celastrol-induced weight loss is hypophagia driven and age-dependently mediated by functional leptin signaling.

Epidemiological studies show that diabetic patients have an increased risk of depression, anxiety, age-related cognitive decline, and Alzheimer's disease. Mice lacking insulin receptor (IR) in the brain or on hypothalamic neurons display an array of metabolic abnormalities; however, the role of insulin action on astrocytes and neurobehaviors remains less well studied. Here, we demonstrate that astrocytes are a direct insulin target in the brain and that knockout of IR on astrocytes causes increased anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in mice. This can be reproduced in part by deletion of IR on astrocytes in the nucleus accumbens. At a molecular level, loss of insulin signaling in astrocytes impaired  phosphorylation of Munc18c. This led to decreased exocytosis of ATP from astrocytes, resulting in decreased purinergic signaling on dopaminergic neurons. These reductions contributed to decreased dopamine release from brain slices. Central administration of ATP analogs could reverse depressive-like behaviors in mice with astrocyte IR knockout. Thus, astrocytic insulin signaling plays an important role in dopaminergic signaling, providing a potential mechanism by which astrocytic insulin action may contribute to increased rates of depression in people with diabetes, , and other insulin-resistant states.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29728717>Circulating amino acids and the risk of macrovascular, microvascular and mortality outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes: results from the ADVANCE trial.</a></h2><p>We aimed to quantify the association of individual circulating amino acids with macrovascular disease, microvascular disease and all-cause mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes.We performed a case-cohort study (N = 3587), including 655 macrovascular events, 342 microvascular events (new or worsening nephropathy or retinopathy) and 632 all-cause mortality events during follow-up, in a secondary analysis of the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) study. For this study, phenylalanine, isoleucine, glutamine, leucine, alanine, , histidine and valine were measured in stored plasma samples by proton NMR metabolomics. Hazard ratios were modelled per SD increase in each amino acid.In models investigating associations and potential mechanisms, after adjusting for age, sex and randomised treatment, phenylalanine was positively, and histidine inversely, associated with macrovascular disease risk. These associations were attenuated to the null on further adjustment for extended classical risk factors (including eGFR and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio). After adjustment for extended classical risk factors, higher  and alanine levels were associated with decreased risk of microvascular disease (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.67, 0.91 and HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.76, 0.98, respectively). Higher leucine (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.69, 0.90), histidine (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.81, 0.99) and valine (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.70, 0.88) levels were associated with lower risk of mortality.

Functional interactions of metabolites with gene/proteins using biological pathway with insulin resistance were not identified biological significance and regulatory effects of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). However, ADMA showed a higher association with adolescent  (P < 0.001) and adult diabetes (P = 0.007) and decreased after  intervention program. Functional studies in cellular and mouse models demonstrated that an accumulation of ADMA is associated with the regulation of -induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. ADMA treatment inhibited dimethylarginine-dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) activity and mRNA expression in insulin resistance muscle cell. Moreover, the treatment led to decrease of phosphorylation of insulin receptor (IR), AKT, and GLUT4 but increase of protein- phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). Accordingly, increased ADMA significantly inhibited glucose uptake in myotube cell. We suggest that accumulation of ADMA is associated with modulation of insulin signaling and insulin resistance.

Unlike other anti-diabetic approaches, genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of PTP1B was found to improve glucose homeostasis and insulin signaling without causing lipid buildup in the liver, which represents an advantage over existing therapies. Furthermore, PTP1B was reported to contribute to cardiovascular disturbances, at various molecular levels, which places this enzyme as a unique single therapeutic target for both diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. Synthesizing selective small molecule inhibitors for PTP1B is faced with multiple challenges linked to its similarity of sequence with other PTPs; however, overcoming these challenges would pave the way for novel approaches to treat diabetes and its concurrent cardiovascular complications. In this review article, we summarized the major roles of PTP1B in cardiovascular disease with special emphasis on endothelial dysfunction and its interplay with insulin resistance.

This however often provides only a fragmented view on the involved metabolic pathways.To demonstrate the feasibility of using Goeman's global test (GGT) for assessment of variation and shifts in metabolic phenotype at the level of a priori defined pathways.Two intervention studies with identified phenotype variations and shifts were examined. In a weight loss (WL) intervention study obese subjects received a mixed meal challenge before and after WL. In a polyphenol (PP) intervention study obese subjects received a high fat mixed meal challenge (61E% fat) before and after a PP intervention. Plasma samples were obtained at fasting and during the postprandial response. Besides WL- and PP-induced phenotype shifts, also correlation of plasma metabolome with phenotype descriptors was assessed at pathway level. The plasma metabolome covered organic acids, amino acids, biogenic amines, acylcarnitines and oxylipins.For the population of the WL study, GGT revealed that HOMA correlated with the fasting levels of the TCA cycle, BCAA catabolism, the lactate, arginine-proline and phenylalanine- pathways. For the population of the PP study, HOMA correlated with fasting metabolite levels of TCA cycle, fatty acid oxidation and phenylalanine- pathways. These correlations were more pronounced for metabolic pathways in the fasting state, than during the postprandial response. The effect of the WL and PP intervention on a priori defined metabolic pathways, and correlation of pathways with insulin sensitivity as described by HOMA was in line with previous studies.GGT confirmed earlier biological findings in a hypothesis led approach. A main advantage of GGT is that it provides a direct view on involvement of a priori defined pathways in phenotype shifts.ClinicalTrials.gov  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30377838>Higher intakes of energy-adjusted dietary amino acids are inversely associated with  risk.</a></h2><p>We assessed the relationship between energy-adjusted amino acids (EAA) intakes and  risk using data on nutrient intakes derived from the Chinese food composition tables to determine dietary intakes (DI) among 1109 obese and 3009 normal weight subjects. Dietary patterns (DP) were identified using principal component analysis, multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of  risk by quartiles of EAA intakes was estimated using logistic regression with two-sided P < 0.05. Multivariable-adjusted OR and 95% CI for  risk were 1.00, 0.801 (0.573, 1.119), 0.718 (0.504, 1.024) and 0.532 (0.353, 0.803) P-trend = 0.003 across energy-adjusted quartiles of total AA intakes. Similarly, higher DI of 13 AA; isoleucine, leucine, valine, lysine, cysteine, phenylalanine, , threonine, histidine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, proline, and serine were associated with lower risk of . Furthermore, six DP; 'Wheaten food and Rice', 'Fruit, Vegetables and Milk', 'Snack, Beverage and Ice cream', 'Potatoes, Soybean & Egg', 'Livestock & Poultry meat' and 'Fish' were identified. Multivariable-adjusted OR and 95% CI across quartiles of DP adherence for  risk were 1.00, 0.737 (0.535, 1.017), 0.563 (0.406, 0.779), 0.724 (0.518, 1.011) P-trend = 0.018 for 'Fruit, Vegetables and Milk', 1.00, 0.734 (0.531, 1.013), 0.841(0.609, 1.161), 0.657 (0.478, 0.904) P-trend = 0.027 for 'Potatoes, Soybean & Egg' and 1.00, 1.106 (0.791, 1.548), 1.367(0.975, 1.917), 1.953 (1.399, 2.726) P-trend = 0.000 for 'Fish'. Additionally, lower adherence to 'Snack, Beverage and Ice cream' and 'Fish' patterns is associated with a protective higher AA intake- risk relationship.

These studies tested the hypothesis that maternal  alters signaling pathways during the course of lung development that may affect life-long pulmonary health. Adult female mice were fed 60% fat [high-fat diet (HFD)] or 10% fat [control diet (CD)] for 8 wk before mating and through weaning. Pup lung tissues were collected at  () , , and  (after receiving HFD or CD as adults). At , body weights from HFD were greater than CD but lung weight-to-body weight ratios were lower. In lung tissues, NFκB-mediated inflammation was greater in HFD pups at  and phospho-/total STAT3, phospho-/total VEGF receptor 2, and total AKT protein levels were lower with maternal HFD and protein  phosphatase B1 levels were increased. Decreased platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule levels were observed at  and at  in the pups exposed to maternal HFD. Morphometry indicated that the pups exposed to maternal or adult HFD had fewer alveoli, and the effect was additive. Decreases in pulmonary resistance, elastance, and compliance were observed because of adult HFD diet and decreases in airway resistance and increases in inspiratory capacity because of maternal HFD. In conclusion, maternal HFD disrupts signaling pathways in the early developing lung and may contribute to deficiencies in lung function and increased susceptibility in adults.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30859654>Receptor  kinase recepteur d'origine nantais as predictive marker for aggressive prostate cancer in African Americans.</a></h2><p>Published evidence shows a correlation between several molecular markers and prostate cancer (PCa) progression including in African Americans (AAs) who are disproportionately affected. Our early detection efforts led to the identification of elevated levels of antiapoptotic protein, c-FLIP and its upstream regulatory factors such as androgen receptor (AR), recepteur d'origine nantais (RON), a receptor  kinase in human prostate tumors. The primary objective of this study was to explore whether these markers play a role in racial disparities using immunohistochemistry in prostatectomy samples from a cohort of AA, Hispanic Whites (HWs), and non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify a statistical association between molecular markers, possible correlation with risk factors including race, , prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and disease aggressiveness. Further, changes in the levels and expression of these molecular markers were also evaluated using human PCa cell lines. We found significantly elevated levels of RON ( P = 0.0082), AR ( P = 0.0001), c-FLIP ( P = 0.0071) in AAs compared with HWs or NHWs. Furthermore, a higher proportion of HW and NHWs had a high Gleason score (>6) but not PSA as compared to AAs ( P = 0.032). In summary, our findings suggest that PSA was important in predicting aggressive disease for the cohort overall; however, high levels of RON may play a role in predisposing AA men to develop aggressive disease. Future research is needed using large datasets to confirm these findings and to explore whether all or any of these markers could aid in race-specific stratification of patients for treatment.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31539748>Discovery of 2-ethoxy-4-(methoxymethyl)benzamide derivatives as potent and selective PTP1B inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a key negative regulator of insulin signaling, is considered as a promising and validated therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and .

The ETV6-NTRK3 (EN) fusion has been implicated in various cancers, including infantile fibrosarcoma, secretory breast carcinoma, and acute myeloblastic leukemia, and has exhibited in vivo and in vitro transforming ability. In the present study, we analyzed transcriptome alterations using DNA microarray and RNA-Seq in EN-transduced NIH3T3 fibroblasts to identify the mechanisms that are involved in EN-mediated tumorigenesis. Through functional profile assessment of EN-regulated transcriptome alterations, we found that upregulated genes by EN were mainly associated with cell motion, membrane invagination, and cell proliferation, while downregulated genes were involved in cell adhesion, which correlated with the transforming potential and increased proliferation in EN-transduced cells. KEGG pathway analysis identified the JAK-STAT signaling pathway with the highest statistical significance. Moreover, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and gene regulatory network analysis identified the STAT1 transcription factor and its target genes as top EN-regulated molecules. We further demonstrated that EN enhanced STAT1 phosphorylation but attenuated STAT1 acetylation, eventually inhibiting the interaction between the NF-κB p65 subunit and acetylated STAT1. Consequently, nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and subsequent NF-κB activity were increased by EN. Notably, inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation attenuated tumorigenic ability of EN in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, here we report, for the first time, STAT1 as a significant EN-regulated transcription factor and a crucial mediator of EN-induced tumorigenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29616029>Neuroprotective Role of the Ron Receptor  Kinase Underlying Central Nervous System Inflammation in Health and Disease.</a></h2><p>Neurodegeneration is a critical problem in aging populations and is characterized by severe central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. Macrophages closely regulate inflammation in the CNS and periphery by taking on different activation states. The source of inflammation in many neurodegenerative diseases has been preliminarily linked to a decrease in the CNS M2 macrophage population and a subsequent increase in M1-mediated neuroinflammation. The Recepteur D'Origine Nantais (Ron) is a receptor  kinase expressed on tissue-resident macrophages including microglia. Activation of Ron by its ligand, macrophage-stimulating protein, attenuates -mediated inflammation in the periphery. An  deletion of the ligand binding domain of Ron (Ron) promotes inflammatory (M1) and limits a reparative (M2) macrophage activation. However, whether or not this response influences CNS inflammation has not been determined. In this study, we demonstrate that in homeostasis Ron mice developed an inflammatory CNS niche with increased tissue expression of M1-associated markers when compared to age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. Baseline metabolic analysis of CNS tissue indicates exacerbated levels of metabolic stress in Ron CNS. In a disease model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, Ron mice exhibit higher disease severity when compared to WT mice associated with increased CNS tissue inflammation. In a model of diet-induced  (DIO), Ron mice exhibit exacerbated CNS inflammation with decreased expression of the M2 marker Arginase-1 (Arg-1) and a robust increase in M1 markers compared to WT mice following 27 weeks of DIO. Collectively, these results illustrate that activation of Ron in the CNS could be a potential therapeutic approach to treating various grades of CNS inflammation underlying neurodegeneration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29441120>Computational Insight into Protein  Phosphatase 1B Inhibition: A Case Study of the Combined Ligand- and Structure-Based Approach.</a></h2><p>Protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is an attractive target for treating cancer, , and type 2 diabetes. In our work, the way of combined ligand- and structure-based approach was applied to analyze the characteristics of PTP1B enzyme and its interaction with competitive inhibitors. Firstly, the pharmacophore model of PTP1B inhibitors was built based on the common feature of sixteen compounds. It was found that the pharmacophore model consisted of five chemical features: one aromatic ring (R) region, two hydrophobic (H) groups, and two hydrogen bond acceptors (A). To further elucidate the binding modes of these inhibitors with PTP1B active sites, four docking programs (AutoDock 4.0, AutoDock Vina 1.0, standard precision (SP) Glide 9.7, and extra precision (XP) Glide 9.7) were used. The characteristics of the active sites were then described by the conformations of the docking results. In conclusion, a combination of various pharmacophore features and the integration information of structure activity relationship (SAR) can be used to design novel potent PTP1B inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29618984>Leptin Intake at Physiological Doses Throughout Lactation in Male Wistar Rats Normalizes the Decreased Density of  Hydroxylase-Immunoreactive Fibers in the Stomach Caused by Mild Gestational Calorie Restriction.</a></h2><p> Gestational under nutrition in rats has been shown to decrease expression of sympathetic innervation markers in peripheral tissues of offspring, including the stomach. This has been linked to lower gastric secretion and decreased circulating levels of ghrelin. Considering the critical role of leptin intake during lactation in preventing  and reversing adverse developmental programming effects, we aimed to find out whether leptin supplementation may reverse the above mentioned alterations caused by mild gestational calorie restriction.  Three groups of male rats were studied at a juvenile age (25 days old) and during adulthood (3 and 6 months old): the offspring of  fed dams (controls), the offspring of dams that were diet restricted (20%) from days 1 to 12 of gestation (CR), and CR rats supplemented with a daily oral dose of leptin (equivalent to 5 times the average amount they could receive each day from maternal milk) throughout lactation (CR-Leptin). The density of TyrOH-immunoreactive (TyrOH) fibers and the levels of  hydroxylase (TyrOH)-used as potential markers of functional sympathetic innervation-were measured in stomach. Plasma leptin and ghrelin levels were also determined.  Twenty five-day-old CR rats, but not CR-Leptin rats, displayed lower density of TyrOH fibers (-46%) and TyrOH levels (-47%) in stomach compared to controls. Alterations in CR animals were mitigated at 6 months of age, and differences were not significant. Adult CR-Leptin animals showed higher plasma ghrelin levels than CR animals, particularly at 3 months (+16%), and a lower leptin/ghrelin ratio (-28 and -37% at 3 and 6 months, respectively).  Leptin intake during lactation is able to reverse the alterations in the density of TyrOH fibers in the stomach and normalize the increased leptin/ghrelin ratio linked to a mild gestational calorie restriction in rats, supporting the relevance of leptin as an essential nutrient during lactation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29533213>Caged xanthones displaying protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibition from Cratoxylum cochinchinense.</a></h2><p>Four new caged xanthones (1-4) and two known compounds (5, 6) were isolated from the roots of Cratoxylum cochinchinense, a polyphenol rich plant, collected in China.

We sought to determine if and how exposure to volatile benzene impacted glucose handling. We exposed wild type C57BL/6 mice to volatile benzene (50 ppm × 6 h/day) or HEPA-filtered air for 2 or 6 weeks and measured indices of oxidative stress, inflammation, and insulin signaling. Compared with air controls, we found that mice inhaling benzene demonstrated increased plasma glucose (p = .05), insulin (p = .03), and HOMA-IR (p = .05), establishing a state of insulin and glucose intolerance. Moreover, insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was diminished in the liver (p = .001) and skeletal muscle (p = .001) of benzene-exposed mice, accompanied by increases in oxidative stress and Nf-κb phosphorylation (p = .025). Benzene-exposed mice also demonstrated elevated levels of Mip1-α transcripts and Socs1 (p = .001), but lower levels of Irs-2  phosphorylation (p = .0001). Treatment with the superoxide dismutase mimetic, TEMPOL, reversed benzene-induced effects on oxidative stress, Nf-κb phosphorylation, Socs1 expression, Irs-2  phosphorylation, and systemic glucose intolerance. These findings suggest that exposure to benzene induces insulin resistance and that this may be a sensitive indicator of inhaled benzene toxicity. Persistent ambient benzene exposure may be a heretofore unrecognized contributor to the global human epidemics of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30196088>Postnatal overnutrition alters the orexigenic effects of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and reduces MCHR1 hypothalamic expression on spontaneous feeding and fasting.</a></h2><p>One of the approaches to induce  in rodents consists in reducing litter size to 3 pups during the lactation period. Animals submitted to this manipulation are heavier, hyperphagic and develop several metabolic diseases for the rest of their lives. In the present study, under the premise that melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), an orexigenic peptide synthesized by neurons of the lateral hypothalamus, is involved in food intake regulation, we aimed to measure the hypothalamic expression of its receptor, MCHR1, in adult early overfed obese animals and normoweight controls at both ad libitum and food deprived conditions. Additionally, we administered MCH, or an antiMCH antibody, into the third ventricle of ad libitum-fed rats, or fasted rats, respectively, and evaluated chow consumption. Typical nocturnal hyperphagia in rodents was elevated in obese animals compared to normoweight controls, accompanied by a lower expression of MCHR1 and leptin receptor (Ob-R). Following a 24 h fasting, MCHR1 remained lower in SL rats. After 4 h of re-feeding, obese animals ate more than normoweight controls. MCH failed to enhance appetite in early overfed obese animals and immunoneutralization of the peptide only reduced fasted induced-hyperphagia in normoweight controls. These results support the notion that both peptide and brain endogenous MCH exert a physiological relevant action in food intake regulation in normoweight rats, but that postnatal overnutrition disturbs this system, as reflected by MCHR1 downregulation at both ad libitum and fasted conditions and in the lack of response to MCH in both positive- and negative-energetic states in early overfed obese animals.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, how much the plasma proteome varies with time of day and is regulated by the master circadian suprachiasmatic nucleus brain clock, assessed here by the melatonin rhythm, is largely unknown. Here, we assessed 24-h time-of-day patterns of human plasma proteins in six healthy men during daytime food intake and nighttime sleep in phase with the endogenous circadian clock (i.e., circadian alignment) versus daytime sleep and nighttime food intake out of phase with the endogenous circadian clock (i.e., circadian misalignment induced by simulated nightshift work). We identified 24-h time-of-day patterns in 573 of 1,129 proteins analyzed, with 30 proteins showing strong regulation by the circadian cycle. Relative to circadian alignment, the average abundance and/or 24-h time-of-day patterns of 127 proteins were altered during circadian misalignment. Altered proteins were associated with biological pathways involved in immune function, metabolism, and cancer. Of the 30 circadian-regulated proteins, the majority peaked between 1400 hours and 2100 hours, and these 30 proteins were associated with basic pathways involved in extracellular matrix organization,  kinase signaling, and signaling by receptor -protein kinase erbB-2. Furthermore, circadian misalignment altered multiple proteins known to regulate glucose homeostasis and/or energy metabolism, with implications for altered metabolic physiology. Our findings demonstrate the circadian clock, the behavioral wake-sleep/food intake-fasting cycle, and interactions between these processes regulate 24-h time-of-day patterns of human plasma proteins and help identify mechanisms of circadian misalignment that may contribute to metabolic dysregulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29955047>Epidermal-specific deletion of TC-PTP promotes UVB-induced epidermal cell survival through the regulation of Flk-1/JNK signaling.</a></h2><p>UVB exposure can contribute to the development of skin cancer by modulating protein  kinase (PTK) signaling. It has been suggested that UVB radiation increases the ligand-dependent activation of PTKs and induces PTP inactivation. Our recent studies have shown that T-cell protein  phosphatase (TC-PTP) attenuates skin carcinogenesis induced by chemical regimens, which indicates its critical role in the prevention of skin cancer. In the current work, we report that TC-PTP increases keratinocyte susceptibility to UVB-induced apoptosis via the downregulation of Flk-1/JNK signaling. We showed that loss of TC-PTP led to resistance to UVB-induced apoptosis in vivo epidermis. We established immortalized primary keratinocytes (IPKs) from epidermal-specific TC-PTP-deficient (K14Cre.Ptpn2) mice. Immortalized TC-PTP-deficient keratinocytes (TC-PTP/KO IPKs) showed increased cell survival against UVB-induced apoptosis which was concomitant with a UVB-mediated increase in Flk-1 phosphorylation, especially on  residue 1173. Inhibition of Flk-1 by either its specific inhibitors or siRNA in TC-PTP/KO IPKs reversed this effect and significantly increased cell death after UVB irradiation in comparison with untreated TC-PTP/KO IPKs. Immunoprecipitation analysis using the TC-PTP substrate-trapping mutant TCPTP-D182A indicated that TC-PTP directly interacts with Flk-1 to dephosphorylate it and their interaction was stimulated by UVB. Following UVB-mediated Flk-1 activation, the level of JNK phosphorylation was also significantly increased in TC-PTP/KO IPKs compared to control IPKs. Similar to our results with Flk-1, treatment of TC-PTP/KO IPKs with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 significantly increased apoptosis after UVB irradiation, confirming that the effect of TC-PTP on UVB-mediated apoptosis is regulated by Flk-1/JNK signaling. Western blot analysis showed that both phosphorylated Flk-1 and phosphorylated JNK were significantly increased in the epidermis of TC-PTP-deficient mice compared to control mice following UVB. Our results suggest that TC-PTP plays a protective role against UVB-induced keratinocyte cell damage by promoting apoptosis via negative regulation of Flk-1/JNK survival signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30718415>TrkB-expressing neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus are necessary and sufficient to suppress homeostatic feeding.</a></h2><p>Genetic evidence indicates that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling through the TrkB receptor plays a critical role in the control of energy balance. Mutations in the  or the TrkB-encoding  gene have been found to cause severe  in humans and mice. However, it remains unknown which brain neurons express TrkB to control body weight. Here, we report that TrkB-expressing neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) regulate food intake. We found that the DMH contains both glutamatergic and GABAergic TrkB-expressing neurons, some of which also express the leptin receptor (LepR). As revealed by Fos immunohistochemistry, a significant number of TrkB-expressing DMH (DMH) neurons were activated upon either overnight fasting or after refeeding. Chemogenetic activation of DMH neurons strongly suppressed feeding in the dark cycle when mice are physiologically hungry, whereas chemogenetic inhibition of DMH neurons greatly promoted feeding in the light cycle when mice are physiologically satiated, without affecting feeding in the dark cycle. Neuronal tracing revealed that DMH neurons do not innervate neurons expressing agouti-related protein in the arcuate nucleus, indicating that DMH neurons are distinct from previously identified LepR-expressing GABAergic DMH neurons that suppress feeding. Furthermore, selective  deletion in the DMH of adult mice led to hyperphagia, reduced energy expenditure, and . Thus, our data show that DMH neurons are a population of neurons that are necessary and sufficient to suppress appetite and maintain physiological satiation.

The mechanism for this transferred metabolic risk is unclear, but many studies have focused on the brain due to its important role in appetite and body-weight regulation. Two main pathways regulate appetite in the brain; homeostatic regulation that occurs predominantly in hypothalamic circuits and hedonic regulation of feeding that occurs via dopaminergic pathways. The current proposal examined the impact of early HFD exposure on the dopaminergic control of hedonic feeding pathways in a translational nonhuman primate model. Japanese macaque offspring from mothers consuming a control (CTR) or HFD were weaned onto control or HFD at an average 8 months of age yielding four groups: maternal and post-weaning control diet (mCTRpCTR), maternal control diet and post-weaning HFD (mCTRpHFD), maternal HFD and post-weaning control diet (mHFDpCTR) and maternal and post-weaning HFD (mHFDpHFD). Brains from 13-month-old offspring were evaluated for expression of neuropeptides that regulate dopaminergic pathways including orexin, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), and  hydroxylase expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Orexin cell numbers in the LH were significantly increased in animals exposed to a post-weaning HFD, while no difference was observed for orexin mRNA content or MCH cell numbers. Orexin fiber projections to the rostral VTA were significantly reduced in mCTRpHFD, mHFDpCTR, and mHFDpHFD groups, but these differences were not significant in the caudal VTA. There was no difference in the percentage of dopamine neurons receiving close appositions from orexin fibers in either the rostral or caudal VTA, nor was there any difference between groups in the number of orexin contacts per TH cell. In conclusion, the current study finds that prolonged early exposure to HFD during the  and postnatal period causes alterations at several levels in the dopaminergic circuits regulating reward.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31164719>The (pro)renin receptor in health and disease.</a></h2><p>The (pro)renin receptor ((P)RR) was first identified as a single-transmembrane receptor in human kidneys and initially attracted attention owing to its potential role as a regulator of the tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS).

The (P)RR has roles in various physiological processes, such as the cell cycle, autophagy, acid-base balance, energy metabolism, embryonic development, T cell homeostasis, water balance, blood pressure regulation, cardiac remodelling and maintenance of podocyte structure. These roles of the (P)RR are mediated by its effects on important biological systems and pathways including the tissue RAS, vacuolar H-ATPase, Wnt, partitioning defective homologue (Par) and  phosphorylation. In addition, the (P)RR has been reported to contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases such as fibrosis, hypertension, pre-eclampsia, diabetic microangiopathy, acute kidney injury, cardiovascular disease, cancer and .

Ineffective pharmacotherapy in the management of cognitive deficits and weight gain are known to be significant contributors; therefore interventions that may mitigate one, or both, of these parameters would be highly beneficial. Manipulation of the gut microbiome using dietary supplements such as prebiotics may be one such intervention. Preclinical studies have shown that a 2-4 week dietary supplementation with a prebiotic has beneficial effects on learning and memory, and prevents pro-inflammatory signals that are detrimental to cognitive processes. Furthermore, prebiotics influence metabolism, and in  they increase the expression of anorexigenic gut hormones such as peptide  , glucagon-like peptide 1 and leptin, as well as decrease levels of orexigenic hormones such as ghrelin. Despite compelling evidence for the pro-cognitive and neuroprotective effects of prebiotics in rodents, their ability to alleviate cognitive deficits or enhance cognition needs to be evaluated in humans. Here we suggest that important symptoms associated with schizophrenia, such as cognitive impairment and weight gain, may benefit from concurrent prebiotic therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

GPRC5B tightly associates with caveolin-1 (Cav1); however, the role of this interaction remains elusive. Here, we report that Cav1 reduces GPRC5B-mediated NF-κB signaling by blocking GPRC5B-phosphorylation. We demonstrate highly abundant  phosphorylation of GPRC5B is observed in Neuro2a cells lacking endogenous Cav1 expression. Reversely, exogenous expression of Cav1 in these cells inhibits GPRC5B-phosphorylation. Although GPRC5B lacks conventional caveolin-binding motif, cytoplasmic tail of GPRC5B directly interacts with the C-terminal domain of Cav1. The vacant scaffolding domain of Cav1 in the protein complex suggests a potential mechanism for blocking GPRC5B-phosphorylation by Cav1, because Fyn loses the activity by binding with Cav1-scaffolding domain. Enhanced GPRC5B-mediated NF-κB signaling in Cav1-deficient cells were observed under palmitate-induced metabolic stress.

K-means cluster analysis of aggregated amino acid and acylcarnitine data was also performed.Analytes and ratios significantly increasing in , T2D, and with worsening health include: branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), cystine, alpha-aminoadipic acid, phenylalanine, leucine + lysine, and short-chain acylcarnitines/total carnitines. , alanine and propionylcarnitine increase with  and metabolic unwellness. Asparagine and the tryptophan/large neutral amino acid ratio decrease with T2D and metabolic unwellness. Malonylcarnitine decreases in  and 3-OHbutyrylcarnitine increases in T2D; neither correlates with unwellness. Cluster analysis did not separate subjects into discreet groups based on metabolic wellness.Levels of 15 species and metabolite ratios trend significantly with worsening metabolic health; some are newly recognized. BCAAs, aromatic amino acids, lysine, and its metabolite, alpha-aminoadipate, increase with worsening health. The lysine pathway is distinct from BCAA metabolism, indicating that biochemical derangements associated with MS involve pathways besides those affected by BCAAs. Even those considered "obese, metabolically well" had metabolite levels which significantly trended towards those found in obese diabetics. Overall, this analysis yields a more granular view of metabolic wellness than the sole use of cardiometabolic MS parameters. This, in turn, suggests the possible utility of plasma metabolomic analysis for research and public health applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658193>GPVI surface expression and signalling pathway activation are increased in platelets from obese patients: Elucidating potential anti-atherothrombotic targets in .</a></h2><p>Platelets play a fundamental role in the increased atherothrombotic risk related to central  since they show hyperactivation and lower sensitivity to antiplatelet therapy in obese patients. The main goal of this study was to identify platelet biomarkers related to the risk of atherothrombosis in obese patients, confirm platelet activation levels in these patients, and identify altered activation pathways.Platelets were obtained from cohorts of obese patients and age- and sex-matched lean controls. Biochemical and proteome analyses were done by two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), mass spectrometry, and immunoblotting. Functional and mechanistic studies were conducted with aggregation assays and flow cytometry.We confirmed an up-regulation of αIIb and fibrinogen isoforms in platelets from obese patients. A complementary platelet aggregation approach showed platelets from obese patients are hyper-reactive in response to collagen and collagen-related peptide (CRP), revealing the collagen receptor Glycoprotein VI (GPVI) signalling as one of the altered pathways. We also found the active form of Src (pTyr418) is up-regulated in platelets from obese individuals, which links proteomics to aggregation data. Moreover, we showed that CRP-activated platelets present higher levels of  phosphorylated PLCγ2 in obese patients, confirming alterations in GPVI signalling. In line with the above, flow cytometry studies show higher surface expression levels of total GPVI and GPVI-dimer in obese platelets, both correlating with BMI.Our results suggest a higher activation state of SFKs-mediated signalling pathways in platelets from obese patients, with a primary involvement of GPVI signalling.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Indeed, it is unknown whether the mechanism of IR in PCOS is mediated through changes in the metabolome.  Twelve women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and ten age and body mass index matched controls completed an 8 week supervised exercise program at 60% maximal oxygen consumption. Before and after the exercise program, all participants underwent maximal IR stimulation with intralipid infusions followed by insulin sensitivity (IS) measurement by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamps. Amino acid profiles and metabolites were taken at baseline and at maximal insulin resistance stimulation before and after the exercise program.  At baseline, PCOS subjects showed increased leucine/isoleucine, glutamate, methionine, ornithine, phenylalanine,  and proline ( < 0.05) that, following exercise, did not differ from controls. While compering within the groups, no significant changes in the amino acid levels before and after exercise were observed. Exercise improved VO2 max ( < 0.01) but did not alter weight. Amino acid profiles were unaffected by an acute increase in IR induced by the lipid infusion. IS was lower in PCOS ( < 0.001) and was further decreased by the lipid infusion in both PCOS and controls. Although, exercise improved IS in both PCOS and in controls, the IS remained compromised in PCOS.  The baseline amino acid profile in PCOS reflected that seen in obese subjects and differed to controls. After exercise, and despite no change in weight in either group, there were no differences in the amino acid profile between PCOS and controls. This shows that exercise may normalize the amino acid metabolome, irrespective of weight. : ISRCTN42448814.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31071507>An integrative investigation on the efficacy of Plantaginis semen based on UPLC-QTOF-MS metabolomics approach in hyperlipidemic mice.</a></h2><p>Plantaginis semen, the dried mature seed of Plantago asiatica L. or Plantago deprdssa Willd., has a prominent effect on the treatment of , type 2 diabetes and lipid disorders, however, its clinical application is limited due to inadequate in-depth mechanism exploration and incomplete discussion of action targets of its in vivo. Therefore, an untargeted metabolomics approach was firstly applied to study the serum metabolic differences in mice. Metabolomics analysis was performed using ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) together with multivariate statistical data analysis. The results showed that Plantaginis semen can mainly improve blood lipids, some degree in blood glucose and insulin levels in high-fat mice, in addition, the phenotype of liver and fat stained sections demonstrated remarkable results. A total of 22 metabolites involved in arachidonic acid, glycerophospholipid, glycosphingolipid, linoleate, Omega-3 fatty acid, phosphatidylinositol phosphate and  metabolisms were identified. In further, it was found that the possible mechanisms of Plantaginis semen on hyperlipidemic mice lied in the biosynthesis of thyroxine, biological effects of enzymes of phospholipase A2 activity, glucosylceramide synthase and inositol essential enzyme 1α, genes expressions of fatty acid metabolism and inflammation. Serum metabolomics revealed that Plantaginis semen could cure the organism disease via regulating multiple metabolic pathways which will be helpful for understanding the mechanism of this herb and providing references for better applications of it in clinic, even researches on other TCMs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Two challenging aspects are selective inhibition and cell permeability. A structure-based strategy was employed to develop uncharged bromophenols as a new series of PTP1B inhibitors. The most potent compound 22 (LXQ46) inhibited PTP1B with an IC value of 0.190 μM, and showed remarkable selectivity over other protein  phosphatases (PTPs, 20-200 folds). In the SPR study, increasing concentrations of compound 22 led to concentration-dependent increases in binding responses, indicating that compound 22 could bind to the surface of PTP1B via noncovalent means. By treating insulin-resistant C2C12 myotubes with compound 22, enhanced insulin and leptin signaling pathways were observed. Long-term oral administration of compound 22 reduced the blood glucose level of diabetic BKS db mice. The glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and insulin tolerance tests (ITT) in BKS db mice showed that oral administration of compound 22 could increase insulin sensitivity. In addition, long-term oral administration of compound 22 could protect mice from , which was not the result of toxicity. Our pharmacokinetics results from the rat-based assays showed that orally administered compound 22 was absorbed rapidly from the gastrointestinal tract, extensively distributed to the tissues, and rapidly eliminated from the body. All these results indicate that compound 22 could serve as a qualified agent to treat type II diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Gene expression (GSE64998) and DNA methylation profiles (GSE65057) from liver tissues of healthy controls and obese patients with T2D were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially‑expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially‑methylated genes (DMGs) were identified using the Limma package, and their overlapping genes were additionally determined. Enrichment analysis was performed using the BioCloud platform on the DEGs and the overlapping genes. Using Cytoscape software, protein‑protein interaction (PPI), transcription factor target networks and microRNA (miRNA) target networks were then constructed in order to determine associated hub genes. In addition, a further GSE15653 dataset was utilized in order to validate the DEGs identified in the GSE64998 dataset analyses. A total of 251 DEGs, including 124 upregulated and 127 downregulated genes, were detected, and a total of 9,698 genes were demonstrated to be differentially methylated in obese patients with T2D compared with non‑obese healthy controls. A total of 103 overlapping genes between the two datasets were revealed, including 47 upregulated genes and 56 downregulated genes. The identified overlapping genes were revealed to be strongly associated with fatty acid and glucose metabolic pathways, in addition to oxidation/reduction. The overlapping genes cyclin D1 (CCND1), PPARG coactivator α (PPARGC1A), fatty acid synthase (FASN), glucokinase (GCK), steraroyl‑coA desaturase (SCD) and  aminotransferase (TAT) had higher degrees in the PPI, transcription target networks and miRNA target networks. In addition, among the 251 DEGs, a total of 35 DEGs were validated to be being shared genes between the datasets, which included a number of key genes in the PPI network, including CCND1, FASN and TAT. Abnormal gene expression and DNA methylation patterns that were implicated in fatty acid and glucose metabolic pathways and oxidation/reduction reactions were detected in obese patients with T2D. Furthermore, the CCND1, PPARGC1A, FANS, GCK, SCD and TAT genes may serve a role in the development of ‑associated T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30615487>Protein  phosphatase alpha inhibits hypothalamic leptin receptor signaling and regulates body weight in vivo.</a></h2><p>Understanding how body weight is regulated at the molecular level is essential for treating . We show that female mice genetically lacking protein  phosphatase (PTP) receptor type α (PTPRA) exhibit reduced weight and adiposity and increased energy expenditure, and are more resistant to diet-induced  than matched wild-type control mice. These mice also exhibit reduced levels of circulating leptin and are leptin hypersensitive, suggesting that PTPRA inhibits leptin signaling in the hypothalamus. Male and female PTPRA-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet were leaner and displayed increased metabolic rates and lower circulating leptin levels, indicating that the effects of loss of PTPRA persist in the obese state. Molecularly, PTPRA down-regulates leptin receptor signaling by dephosphorylating the receptor-associated kinase JAK2, with which the phosphatase associates constitutively. In contrast to the closely related  phosphatase ε, leptin induces only weak phosphorylation of PTPRA at its C-terminal regulatory site Y789, and this does not affect the activity of PTPRA toward JAK2. PTPRA is therefore an inhibitor of hypothalamic leptin signaling in vivo and may prevent premature activation of leptin signaling, as well as return signaling to baseline after exposure to leptin.-Cohen-Sharir, Y., Kuperman, Y., Apelblat, D., den Hertog, J., Spiegel, I., Knobler, H., Elson, A.

Impaired intestinal barrier functions play a major role in chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI)-associated , but the regulation of BCRP during  and its role in maintaining the intestinal barrier function during CLGI-associated  are unknown. In the present study, using several approaches, including efflux assays, immunoprecipitation/-blotting/-histochemistry, paracellular permeability assay, fluorescence activated cell sorting, cytokine assay, and immunofluorescence microscopy, we report that obese individuals have compromised intestinal BCRP functions and that diet-induced obese mice recapitulate these outcomes. We demonstrate that the compromised BCRP functions during  are due to loss of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3)-mediated  phosphorylation of BCRP. Our results indicate that JAK3-mediated phosphorylation of BCRP promotes its interactions with membrane-localized β-catenin essential not only for BCRP expression and surface localization, but also for the maintenance of BCRP-mediated intestinal drug efflux and barrier functions. We observed that reduced intestinal JAK3 expression during human  or JAK3 knockout in mouse or siRNA-mediated β-catenin knockdown in human intestinal epithelial cells all result in significant loss of intestinal BCRP expression and compromised colonic drug efflux and barrier functions. Our results uncover a mechanism of BCRP-mediated intestinal drug efflux and barrier functions and establish a role for BCRP in preventing CLGI-associated  both in humans and in mice.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29907843>Plasma metabolites reveal distinct profiles associating with different metabolic risk factors in monozygotic twin pairs.</a></h2><p> is related to a myriad of cardiometabolic outcomes, each of which may have a specific metabolomic signature and a genetic basis. We identified plasma metabolites associating with different cardiometabolic risk factors (adiposity, cholesterol, insulin resistance, and inflammation) in monozygotic (MZ) twins. Additionally, we assessed if metabolite profiling can identify subgroups differing by cardiometabolic risk factors.We quantified 111 plasma metabolites (Acquity UPLC-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry), and measured blood lipids, HOMA index, CRP, and adiposity (BMI, %bodyfat by DEXA, fat distribution by MRI) in 40 MZ twin pairs (mean BMI 27.9 kg/m, age 30.7). We determined associations among individuals (via linear regression) between metabolites and clinical phenotypes, and assessed, with within-twin pair analysis, if these associations were free from genetic confounding. We also performed cluster analysis to identify distinct subgroups based on subjects' metabolite profiles.We identified 42 metabolite-phenotype associations (FDR < 0.05), 19 remained significant after controlling for shared factors within the twin pairs. Aspartate, propionylcarnitine,  hexanoylcarnitine, and deoxycytidine associated positively with two or more adiposity measures. HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) associated negatively and BMI positively with the most numbers of metabolites; 12 were unique for HDL-C and 3 for BMI. Metabolites associating with HDL-C had the strongest effect size. Metabolite profiling revealed two distinct subgroups of individuals, differing by 32 metabolites (p < 0.05), and by total and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). Forty-two metabolites predicted subgroup membership in correlation with total cholesterol and 45 metabolites predicted subgroup membership in correlation with LDL-C.Different fat depots share metabolites associating with general adiposity. BMI and HDL-C associated with the most pronounced and specific metabolomic signature. Metabolomics profiling can be used to identify distinct subgroups of individuals that differ by cholesterol measures.

In mice, the deletion of insulin receptor substrate type 2 (Irs2) causes peripheral insulin resistance and reduction in β-cell mass, leading to overt diabetes, with gender differences on adrenergic signaling. To further unravel the relevance of Irs2 on glycemic control, we analyzed in adult Irs2 deficient (Irs2) mice, of both sexes but still normoglycemic, dopamine effects on insulin secretion and glycerol release, as well as their adrenal medulla by an immunohistochemical and morphologic approach. In isolated islets, 10 μM dopamine significantly inhibited insulin release in wild-type (WT) and female Irs2 mice; however, male Irs2 islets were insensitive to that catecholamine. Similarly, on isolated adipocytes, gender differences were observed between WT and Irs2 mice in basal and evoked glycerol release with crescent concentrations of dopamine. By immunohistochemistry, reactivity to  hydroxylase (TH) in female mice was significantly higher in the adrenal medulla of Irs2 compared to WT; although no differences for TH-immunopositivity were observed between the male groups of mice. However, compared to their corresponding WT animals, adrenomedullary chromaffin cells of Irs2 mice showed a significant decrease in the cellular and nuclear areas, and even in their percentage of apoptosis. Therefore, our observations suggest that, together with gender differences on dopamine responses in Irs2 mice, disturbances in adrenomedullary chromaffin cells could be related to deficiency of Irs2. Accordingly, Irs2 could be necessary for adequate glucose homeostasis and maintenance of the population of the adrenomedullary chromaffin cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29726700>Acute exercise induced BDNF-TrkB signalling is intact in the prefrontal cortex of obese, glucose-intolerant male mice.</a></h2><p> and glucose intolerance have been directly implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. It is thought that diet-induced  causes a reduction in neuronal plasticity through a reduction in the neurotrophin: brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Previous work has demonstrated that acute exercise in healthy lean animals increases BDNF-TrkB signalling in the brain. However, if this effect is intact in a state of  remains unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a single bout of exercise on BDNF-TrkB signalling in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus from obese glucose intolerant mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a low-fat diet (10% kcals from lard) or a high-fat diet (HFD, 60% kcals from lard) for 7 weeks. A subset of HFD mice underwent an acute bout of exercise (treadmill running: 15 m/min, 5% incline, 120 min) followed by a recovery period of 2 h, after which point the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were collected. The HFD increased body mass and glucose intolerance (p < 0.05). Prefrontal cortex from HFD mice demonstrated lower BDNF protein content, reduced phosphorylation of the BDNF receptor (TrkB), and its downstream effector cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), as well as PGC-1α and ERα) protein content (p < 0.05). Two hours following the acute exercise bout, TrkB and CREB phosphorylation as well as PGC-1α and ER-α protein content were recovered (p < 0.05).

Intrauterine undernutrition and overnutrition are among the predisposing factors, but the exact mechanism of how overeating develops is still unclear. Consummatory behavior is regulated by the medial shell (mSh) of the accumbens nucleus (Nac) through direct connections with the rostral part of the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). Our aim was to investigate whether an altered Nac-LHA circuit may underlie hyperphagic behavior.Intrauterine protein-restricted (PR) male Wistar rats were used as models for hyperphagia. The experiments were performed using young adult control (normally nourished) and PR animals. Sweet condensed milk (SCM) served as a reward to test consumption and subsequent activation (Fos+) of Nac and LHA neurons. Expression levels of type 1 and 2 dopamine receptors (D1R, D2R) in the Nac, as well as  hydroxylase (TH) levels in the ventral tegmental area, were determined. The D1R agonist SKF82958 was injected into the mSh-Nac of control rats to test the effect of D1R signaling on SCM intake and neuronal cell activation in the LHA.A group of food reward-representing D1R+ neurons was identified in the mSh-Nac. Activation (Fos+) of these neurons was highly proportional to the consumed palatable food. D1R agonist treatment attenuated SCM intake and diminished the number of SCM-activated cells in the LHA. Hyperphagic PR rats showed increased intake of SCM, reduced D1R expression, and an impaired response to SCM-evoked neuronal activation in the mSh-Nac, accompanied by an elevated number of Fos+ neurons in the LHA compared to controls.Sensitivity of food reward-representing neurons in the mSh-Nac determines the level of satisfaction that governs cessation of consumption, probably through connections with the LHA. D1R signaling is a key element in this function, and is impaired in -prone rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31410531>Adenine nucleotide-mediated regulation of hepatic PTP1B activity in mouse models of type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>Plasma 5'-AMP (pAMP) is elevated in mouse models of type 2 diabetes. However, the metabolic regulatory role of adenine nucleotides in type 2 diabetes remains unclear.Adenine nucleotides and their metabolites in plasma and liver were examined by HPLC. H NMR-based metabolomics analysis was performed to explore the changes of metabolites in mouse models of type 2 diabetes. Na/K ATPase and Na/H exchanger activity were measured in response to adenine nucleotide metabolites. Human recombinant protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) was used for enzyme kinetic assays. Protein binding assays were performed with microscale thermophoresis. The intracellular pH of hepatocyte AML12 cell lines was measured using the BCECF-AM method. We also analysed pAMP levels in participants with type 2 diabetes.Elevation of pAMP was a universal phenomenon in all mouse models of type 2 diabetes including db/db vs lean mice (13.9 ± 2.3 μmol/l vs 3.7 ± 0.9 μmol/l; p < 0.01), ob/ob vs lean mice (9.1 ± 2.0 μmol/l vs 3.9 ± 1.2 μmol/l; p < 0.01) and high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced vs wild-type mice (6.6 ± 1.5 μmol/l vs 4.1 ± 0.9 μmol/l; p < 0.05); this elevation was required for the occurrence of hyperglycaemia in obese mice. H NMR-based metabolomics study following HPLC analysis revealed that the metabolite profile in wild-type mice treated with 5'-AMP was similar to that in db/db diabetic mice, especially the accumulation of a large quantity of ATP and its metabolites. The glucose-lowering drug metformin reduced the severity of hyperglycaemia both in 5'-AMP-induced wild-type mice and db/db mice. Metformin decreased the accumulation of liver ATP but not its metabolites in these hyperglycaemic mice. ATP and metformin reciprocally change cellular pH homeostasis in liver, causing opposite shifts in liver activity of PTP1B, a key negative regulator of insulin signalling. Furthermore, pAMP levels were also elevated in individuals with type 2 diabetes (45.2 ± 22.7 nmol/l vs 3.1 ± 1.9 nmol/l; p < 0.01).These results reveal an emerging role for adenine nucleotide in the regulation of hyperglycaemia and provide a potential therapeutic target in  and type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30890718>The association of genetically controlled CpG methylation (cg158269415) of protein  phosphatase, receptor type N2 (PTPRN2) with childhood .</a></h2><p>Protein  phosphatase, receptor type N2 (PTPRN2) encodes a major islet autoantigen in type-1 diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes, which is closely related to overweight, is characterized by insulin resistance. In both cases, proinflammatory cytokines play an important role by causing insulitis and insulin resistance. The gum resin of Boswellia species and its pharmacologically active compounds, including 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids have been shown to suppress the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in various immune-competent cells.To review the present evidence of the therapeutic effects of boswellic extracts (BE) and/or 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids in the prevention/treatment of diabetes mellitus and to provide comprehensive insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms.This review considers all available informations from preclinical and clinical studies concerning BEs, 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids, proinflammatory cytokines and diabetes mellitus collected via electronic search (PubMed) and related publications of the author.Type 1 diabetes: Studies in mice with autoimmune diabetes revealed that in the model of multiple injections of low doses of streptozotocin (MLD-STZ), an extract of the gum resin of Boswellia serrata and 11-keto-ß-boswellic acid (KBA) suppressed the increase in proinflammatory cytokines in the blood, infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and increase in blood glucose. In a second model, i.e. the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, KBA prevented the infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets. Regarding the clinical effects, a case report provided evidence that BE suppressed the blood levels of  phosphatase antibody (IA-A), a marker for insulitis, in a patient with late-onset autoimmune diabetes of the adult (LADA). Type 2 diabetes: In a preclinical study in rats where  was alimentary induced, the administration of BE significantly reduced food intake, overweight, proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and ameliorated the parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism. Similar results were obtained in a second animal study, where type 2 diabetes was induced by a combination of a high-fat/high-fructose diet and a single dose of streptozotocin. Two clinical trials with patients with type 2 diabetes receiving the resin of Boswellia serrata demonstrated improvement in the blood glucose, HbA and lipid parameters.Preclinical and clinical data suggest that BE and/or 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids by inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines from immune-competent cells, may prevent insulitis and insulin resistance in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively, and therefore may be an option in the treatment/prevention of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It is hypothesized that molecularly, BE and 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids act via interference with the IκB kinase/Nuclear Transcription Factor-κB (IKK/NF-κB) signaling pathway through inhibition of the phosphorylation activity of IKK. However, further investigations and well-designed clinical studies are required.Copyright © 2019 The Author. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Investigation of new inhibitors with good bioavailability and high selectivity is the major challenge of drug discovery program targeting PTP1B. Therefore, herein, new neutral benzene-sulfonamide containing compounds were designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated as potent PTP1B inhibitors. New series of thiazolidine, oxazolidine, thiazinan, oxazinan, oxazole, thiazole, tetrazole, cyanopyridine, chromenone, and iminochromene of benzene-sulfonamide derivatives (MSE-1 to MSE-15) were synthesized in a good yield under mild condition using sulfadiazine as a starting material. Among the synthesized compounds, MSE-13 and MSE-14 showed the most in vitro potent PTP-1B inhibitory activity (IC of 0.88 µM and 3.33 µM, respectively). Animal treatment by the target compounds significantly improved the insulin resistance, diminished plasma glucose level, decreased initial body weight, and normalized the serum lipid profile compared to pioglitazone, a standard PTP1B inhibitor. The molecular modeling study showed a high affinity and selectivity of our synthesized compounds to the active site and B-site of PTP1B holding hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, Electrostatic Surface Potential (ESP) and HOMO/LUMO analysis indicated the importance of sulfamoyl moiety for PTP1B binding.

Aging resulted in increased body weight, and insulin resistance and decreases learning process in MWM. Interestingly, the middle-aged rats have higher levels of PTP-1B, lower phosphorylation of IRS-1, Akt, GSK3β, mTOR, and TrkB.

We conducted a retrospective observational multicentric study in Spanish HT1 patients treated with NTBC to assess clinical and biochemical long-term evolution.We evaluated 52 patients, 7 adults and 45 children, treated with NTBC considering: age at diagnosis, diagnosis by clinical symptoms, or by newborn screening (NBS); phenotype (acute/subacute/chronic), mutational analysis; symptoms at diagnosis and clinical course; biochemical markers; doses of NTBC; treatment adherence; anthropometric evolution; and neurocognitive outcome.The average follow-up period was 6.1 ± 4.9 and 10.6 ± 5.4 years in patients with early and late diagnosis respectively. All patients received NTBC from diagnosis with an average dose of 0.82 mg/kg/d. All NBS-patients (n = 8) were asymptomatic at diagnosis except 1 case with acute liver failure, and all remain free of liver and renal disease in follow-up. Liver and renal affectation was markedly more frequent at diagnosis in patients with late diagnosis (P < .001 and .03, respectively), with ulterior positive hepatic and renal course in 86.4% and 93.2% of no-NBS patients, although 1 patient with good metabolic control developed hepatocarcinoma.Despite a satisfactory global nutritional evolution, 46.1% of patients showed overweight/. Interestingly lower body mass index was observed in patients with good dietary adherence (20.40 ± 4.43 vs 24.30 ± 6.10; P = .08) and those with good pharmacological adherence (21.19 ± 4.68 vs 28.58 ± 213.79).intellectual quotient was ≥85 in all NBS- and 68.75% of late diagnosis cases evaluated, 15% of which need pedagogical support, and 6.8% (3/44) showed school failure.Among the 12 variants identified in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase gene, 1 of them novel (H63D), the most prevalent in Spanish population is c.554-1 G>T.After NTBC treatment a reduction in  and alpha-fetoprotein levels was observed in all the study groups, significant for alpha-fetoprotein in no NBS-group (P = .03), especially in subacute/chronic forms (P = .018).This series confirms that NTBC treatment had clearly improved the prognosis and quality of life of HT1 patients, but it also shows frequent cognitive dysfunctions and learning difficulties in medium-term follow-up, and, in a novel way, a high percentage of overweight/.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30254363>Impact of  on angiogenic and inflammatory markers in the Finnish Genetics of Pre-eclampsia Consortium (FINNPEC) cohort.</a></h2><p>While several studies have demonstrated that  increases the risk of pre-eclampsia (PE), the mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. We assessed the association between maternal/paternal  and PE and hypothesized that maternal body mass index (BMI) would be associated with an adverse inflammatory and angiogenic profile. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and following serum angiogenic markers were determined: soluble endoglin (sEng), soluble fms-like  kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and placental growth factor (PlGF).Data on BMI were available from 1450 pregnant women with PE and 1065 without PE. Serum concentrations of hs-CRP and angiogenic markers were available from a subset at first and third trimesters.Prepregnancy BMI was higher in the PE group than in controls (mean ± SD) 25.3 ± 5.2 vs. 24.1 ± 4,4, p < 0.001, adjusted for parity, mother's age, and smoking status before pregnancy. Increased hs-CRP concentrations were observed in both PE and non-PE women similarly according to BMI category. In women with PE, a higher BMI was associated with lower sFlt-1 and sEng concentrations throughout the pregnancy (p = 0.004, p = 0.008, respectively). There were no differences in PlGF in PE women according to BMI.We confirmed increased pre-pregnancy BMI in women with PE. Enhanced inflammatory state was confirmed in all women with overweight/.

To better understand the contribution of genetic variation to amino acid levels, we performed single variant and gene-based tests of association between nine serum amino acids (alanine, glutamine, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, , and valine) and 16.6 million genotyped and imputed variants in 8545 non-diabetic Finnish men from the METabolic Syndrome In Men (METSIM) study with replication in Northern Finland Birth Cohort (NFBC1966). We identified five novel loci associated with amino acid levels (P = < 5×10-8): LOC157273/PPP1R3B with glycine (rs9987289, P = 2.3×10-26); ZFHX3 (chr16:73326579, minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.42%, P = 3.6×10-9), LIPC (rs10468017, P = 1.5×10-8), and WWOX (rs9937914, P = 3.8×10-8) with alanine; and TRIB1 with  (rs28601761, P = 8×10-9). Gene-based tests identified two novel genes harboring missense variants of MAF <1% that show aggregate association with amino acid levels: PYCR1 with glycine (Pgene = 1.5×10-6) and BCAT2 with valine (Pgene = 7.4×10-7); neither gene was implicated by single variant association tests. These findings are among the first applications of gene-based tests to identify new loci for amino acid levels. In addition to the seven novel gene associations, we identified five independent signals at established amino acid loci, including two rare variant signals at GLDC (rs138640017, MAF=0.95%, Pconditional = 5.8×10-40) with glycine levels and HAL (rs141635447, MAF = 0.46%, Pconditional = 9.4×10-11) with histidine levels. Examination of all single variant association results in our data revealed a strong inverse relationship between effect size and MAF (Ptrend<0.001). These novel signals provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms of amino acid metabolism and potentially, their perturbations in disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30078194>Endurance training prevents inflammation and apoptosis in hypothalamic neurons of obese mice.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the effects of exercise training in regulating inflammatory processes, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptosis in hypothalamic neurons of obese mice. Swiss mice were distributed into three groups: Lean mice (Lean), sedentary animals fed a standard diet; obese mice (Obese), sedentary animals fed a high-fat diet (HFD); trained obese mice (T. Obese), animals fed with HFD and concurrently subjected to an endurance training protocol for 8 weeks. In the endurance training protocol, mice ran on a treadmill at 60% of peak workload for 1 hr, 5 days/week for 8 weeks. Twenty-four hours after the last exercise session, the euthanasia was performed. Western blot, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase biotin-dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) techniques were used for the analysis of interest. The results show exercise training increased phosphorylation of leptin signaling pathway proteins (pJAK2/pSTAT3) and reduced the content of tumor necrosis factor α, toll-like receptor 4, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, protein- phosphatase 1B as well as the phosphorylation of IkB kinase in the hypothalamus of T. Obese animals. A reduction of macrophage activation and phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α, and protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) were also observed in exercised animals. Furthermore, exercise decreased the expression of the proapoptotic protein (PARP1) and increased anti-inflammatory (IL-10) and antiapoptotic (Bcl2) proteins. Using the TUNEL technique, we observed that the exercised animals had lower DNA fragmentation. Finally, physical exercise preserved pro-opiomelanocortin messenger RNA content. In conclusion, exercise training was able to reorganize the control of the energy balance through anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic responses in hypothalamic tissue of obese mice.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29587405>Further New Diterpenoids as PTP1B Inhibitors from the Xisha Soft Coral Sinularia polydactyla.</a></h2><p>A new prenyleudesmane type diterpene, sinupol (), and a new capnosane type diterpenoid, sinulacetate (), were isolated from the Xisha soft coral  along with five known related diterpenes (- and ).

Current small molecule DYRK1A inhibitors are ATP-competitive inhibitors that bind to the kinase in an active conformation. As a result, these inhibitors are promiscuous, resulting in pharmacological side effects that limit their therapeutic applications. None are in clinical trials at this time. In order to identify a new DYRK1A inhibitor scaffold, we constructed a homology model of DYRK1A in an inactive, DFG-out conformation. Virtual screening of 2.2 million lead-like compounds from the ZINC database, followed by in vitro testing of selected 68 compounds revealed 8 hits representing 5 different chemical classes. We chose to focus on one of the hits from the computational screen, thiadiazine 1 which was found to inhibit DYRK1A with IC of 9.41 μM (K = 7.3 μM). Optimization of the hit compound 1, using structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis and in vitro testing led to the identification of potent thiadiazine analogs with significantly improved binding as compared to the initial hit (K = 71-185 nM). Compound 3-5 induced human β-cell proliferation at 5 μM while showing selectivity for DYRK1A over DYRK1B and DYRK2 at 10 μM. This newly developed DYRK1A inhibitor scaffold with unique kinase selectivity profiles has potential to be further optimized as novel therapeutics for diabetes.Copyright © 2018.

S6K1 hyperactivation due to overnutrition leads to hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes. Our recent study showed that A77 1726, the active metabolite of the anti-rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug leflunomide, is an inhibitor of S6K1. Whether leflunomide can control hyperglycemia and sensitize the insulin receptor has not been tested. Here we report that A77 1726 increased AKT and S6K1 phosphorylation but decreased S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, C2C12 and L6 myotubes. A77 1726 increased insulin receptor  phosphorylation and binding of the p85 subunit of the PI-3 kinase to IRS-1. A77 1726 enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in L6 myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation to the plasma membrane of L6 cells. Finally, we investigated the anti-hyperglycemic effect of leflunomide on  and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetes mouse models. Leflunomide treatment normalized blood glucose levels and overcame insulin resistance in glucose and insulin tolerance tests in  and HFD-fed mice but had no effect on mice fed a normal chow diet (NCD). Leflunomide treatment increased AKT phosphorylation in the fat and muscle of  mice but not in normal mice. Our results suggest that leflunomide sensitizes the insulin receptor by inhibiting S6K1 activity , and that leflunomide could be potentially useful for treating patients with both RA and diabetes.© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29660031>Meningioma transcription factors link cell lineage with systemic metabolic cues.</a></h2><p>Tumor cells recapitulate cell-lineage transcriptional programs that are characteristic of normal tissues from which they arise. It is unclear why such lineage programs are fatefully maintained in tumors and if they contribute to cell proliferation and viability.Here, we used the most common brain tumor, meningioma, which is strongly associated with female sex and high body mass index (BMI), as a model system to address these questions. We screened expression profiling data to identify the transcription factor (TF) genes which are highly enriched in meningioma, and characterized the expression pattern of those TFs and downstream genes in clinical meningioma samples as well as normal brain tissues. Meningioma patient-derived cell lines (PDCLs) were used for further validation and characterization.We identified 8 TFs highly enriched in meningioma. Expression of these TFs, which included sine oculis homeobox 1 (SIX1), readily distinguished meningiomas from other primary brain tumors and was maintained in PDCLs and even in pulmonary meningothelial nodules. In meningioma PDCLs, SIX1 and its coactivator eyes absent 2 (EYA2) supported the expression of the leptin receptor (LEPR), the cell-surface receptor for leptin (LEP), the adipose-specific hormone that is high in women and in individuals with high BMI. Notably, these transcriptional regulatory factors, LEPR and LEP, both contributed to support meningioma PDCLs proliferation and survival, elucidating a survival dependency on both a core transcriptional program and a metabolic cell-surface receptor.These findings provide one rationale for why lineage TF expression is maintained in meningioma and for the epidemiological association of female sex and  with meningioma risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30306746>-Associated Metabolic Signatures Correlate to Clinical and Inflammatory Profiles of Asthma: A Pilot Study.</a></h2><p> is associated with metabolic dysregulation, but the underlying metabolic signatures involving clinical and inflammatory profiles of obese asthma are largely unexplored. We aimed at identifying the metabolic signatures of obese asthma.Eligible subjects with obese (n = 11) and lean (n = 22) asthma underwent body composition and clinical assessment, sputum induction, and blood sampling. Sputum supernatant was assessed for interleukin (IL)-1β, -4, -5, -6, -13, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and serum was detected for leptin, adiponectin and C-reactive protein. Untargeted gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS)-based metabolic profiles in sputum, serum and peripheral blood monocular cells (PBMCs) were analyzed by orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) and pathway topology enrichment analysis. The differential metabolites were further validated by correlation analysis with body composition, and clinical and inflammatory profiles.Body composition, asthma control, and the levels of IL-1β, -4, -13, leptin and adiponectin in obese asthmatics were significantly different from those in lean asthmatics. OPLS-DA analysis revealed 28 differential metabolites that distinguished obese from lean asthmatic subjects. The validation analysis identified 18 potential metabolic signatures (11 in sputum, 4 in serum and 2 in PBMCs) of obese asthmatics. Pathway topology enrichment analysis revealed that cyanoamino acid metabolism, caffeine metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis, pentose phosphate pathway in sputum, and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway in serum are suggested to be significant pathways related to obese asthma.GC-TOF-MS-based metabolomics indicates obese asthma is characterized by a metabolic profile different from lean asthma. The potential metabolic signatures indicated novel immune-metabolic mechanisms in obese asthma with providing more phenotypic and therapeutic implications, which needs further replication and validation.Copyright © 2018 The Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology · The Korean Academy of Pediatric Allergy and Respiratory Disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29731242>Therapeutic effects of the allosteric protein  phosphatase 1B inhibitor KY-226 on experimental diabetes and  via enhancements in insulin and leptin signaling in mice.</a></h2><p>The anti-diabetic and anti- effects of the allosteric protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibitor 4-(biphenyl-4-ylmethylsulfanylmethyl)-N-(hexane-1-sulfonyl)benzoylamide (KY-226) were pharmacologically evaluated. KY-226 inhibited human PTP1B activity (IC = 0.28 μM), but did not exhibit peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonist activity. In rodent preadipocytes (3T3-L1), KY-226 up to 10 μM had no effects on adipocyte differentiation, whereas pioglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, markedly promoted it. In human hepatoma-derived cells (HepG2), KY-226 (0.3-10 μM) increased the phosphorylated insulin receptor (pIR) produced by insulin. In db/db mice, the oral administration of KY-226 (10 and 30 mg/kg/day, 4 weeks) significantly reduced plasma glucose and triglyceride levels as well as hemoglobin A1c values without increasing body weight gain, while pioglitazone exerted similar effects with increases in body weight gain. KY-226 attenuated plasma glucose elevations in the oral glucose tolerance test. KY-226 also increased pIR and phosphorylated Akt in the liver and femoral muscle. In high-fat diet-induced obese mice, the oral administration of KY-226 (30 and 60 mg/kg/day, 4 weeks) decreased body weight gain, food consumption, and fat volume gain with increases in phosphorylated STAT3 in the hypothalamus.

It is also known to influence soluble fms-like  kinase-1 level, which correlates significantly with the gestational age at onset and severity of pre-eclampsia. The main aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials was to determine whether metformin use is associated with the incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP).MEDLINE (1947 to September 2017), Scopus (1970 to September 2017) and the Cochrane Library (inception to September 2017) were searched for relevant citations in the English language. Only randomized controlled trials on metformin use, reporting the incidence of pre-eclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension, were included. Studies on populations with a high probability of metformin use prior to randomization (those with type II diabetes or polycystic ovary syndrome) were excluded. Random-effects models with the Mantel-Haenszel method were used for subgroup analyses. Bayesian random-effects meta-regression was used to summarize the evidence.In total, 3337 citations matched the search criteria. After evaluating 2536 abstracts and performing full-text review of 52 studies, 15 were included in the review. In women with gestational diabetes, metformin use was associated with a reduced risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension when compared with insulin (relative risk (RR), 0.56; 95% CI, 0.37-0.85; I  = 0%; 1260 women) and a non-significantly reduced risk of pre-eclampsia (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.60-1.14; I  = 0%; 1724 women). In obese women, when compared with placebo, metformin use was associated with a non-significant reduction in risk of pre-eclampsia (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.09-6.28; I  = 86%; 840 women). In women with gestational diabetes, metformin use was also associated with a non-significant reduction in risk of any HDP (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.41-1.25; I  = 0%; 556 women) when compared with glyburide. When studies were combined using Bayesian random-effects meta-regression, with treatment type as a covariate, the posterior probabilities of metformin having a beneficial effect on the prevention of pre-eclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertension and any HDP were 92.7%, 92.8% and 99.2%, respectively, when compared with any other treatment or placebo.There is a high probability that metformin use is associated with reduced HDP incidence when compared with other treatments or placebo. The small number of studies included in the analysis, the low quality of evidence and the clinical heterogeneity preclude generalization of these results to broader populations. Given the clinical importance of this topic and the magnitude of effect observed in this meta-analysis, further prospective trials are urgently needed. Copyright © 2018 ISUOG.

Although the intestinal L-cell hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide - (PYY) have attracted the most attention, direct tests in humans and rodents with pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of either the GLP1-receptor (GLP1R) or the Y2-receptor (Y2R) were unable to confirm their critical roles in the beneficial effects gastric bypass surgery on body weight and glucose homeostasis. However, new awareness of the power of combinatorial therapies in the treatment of metabolic disease would suggest that combined blockade of more than one signaling pathway may be necessary to reverse the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery.The metabolic effects of high-fat diet and the ability of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery to lower food intake and body weight, as well as improve glucose handling, was tested in GLP1R and Y2R-double knockout (GLP1RKO/Y2RKO) and C57BL6J wildtype (WT) mice.GLP1RKO/Y2RKO and WT mice responded similarly for up to 20 weeks on high-fat diet and 16 weeks after RYGB. There were no significant differences in loss of body and liver weight, fat mass, reduced food intake, relative increase in energy expenditure, improved fasting insulin, glucose tolerance, and insulin tolerance between WT and GLP1RKO/Y2RKO mice after RYGB.Combined loss of GLP1R and Y2R-signaling was not able to negate or attenuate the beneficial effects of RYGB on body weight and glucose homeostasis in mice, suggesting that a larger number of signaling pathways is involved or that the critical pathway has not yet been identified.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

It is activated in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli including cytokines and growth factors. The aberrant activation of STAT3 contributes to several human diseases, particularly cancer. Consequently, STAT3-mediated signaling continues to be extensively studied in order to identify potential targets for the development of new and more effective clinical therapeutics. STAT3 activation can be regulated, either positively or negatively, by different posttranslational mechanisms including serine or  phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, acetylation, or demethylation. One of the major mechanisms that negatively regulates STAT3 activation is dephosphorylation of the  residue essential for its activation by protein  phosphatases (PTPs). There are seven PTPs that have been shown to dephosphorylate STAT3 and, thereby, regulate STAT3 signaling: PTP receptor-type D (PTPRD), PTP receptor-type T (PTPRT), PTP receptor-type K (PTPRK), Src homology region 2 (SH-2) domain-containing phosphatase 1(SHP1), SH-2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2), MEG2/PTP non-receptor type 9 (PTPN9), and T-cell PTP (TC-PTP)/PTP non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2).

Glut4 expression levels are correlated with whole-body glucose homeostasis. Insulin signaling is known to recruit Glut4 to the cell surface. Expression of Glut4 is subject to tissue-specific hormonal and metabolic regulation. The molecular mechanisms regulating skeletal muscle Glut4 expression remain to be elucidated. Myostatin (Mstn) is reported to be involved in the regulation of energy metabolism. While elevated Mstn levels in muscle are associated with  and type-2 diabetes in both human and mouse models, Mstn null mice exhibit immunity to dietary-induced  and insulin resistance. The molecular mechanisms by which Mstn initiates the development of insulin resistance and disorders of glucose disposal are not well delineated. Here we investigated effects of Mstn on insulin action in C2C12 cells. Mstn significantly reduced basal and insulin-induced IRS-1  (Tyr495) phosphorylation, and expression and activation of PI3K, associated with diminished AKT phosphorylation and elevated GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser9. In addition, Mstn inhibited Glut4 mRNA and protein expression, and reduced insulin-induced Glut4 membrane translocation and glucose uptake. Conversely, SB431542, a Smad2/3 inhibitor, significantly increased cellular response to insulin. Mstn decreased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity accompanied by reduced Glut4 gene expression and glucose uptake, which were partially reversed by AICAR, an AMPK activator. These data suggest that Mstn inhibits Glut4 expression and insulin-induced Glut4 integration into cytoplasmic membranes and glucose uptake and that these changes are mediated by direct insulin-desensitizing effect and indirect suppression of AMPK activation.© 2018 The Authors.

However, the molecular basis contributing to this healthy phenotype remains unclear. The objective of this work was to identify -related metabolite patterns differed between MHO and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUHO) groups and examine whether these patterns are associated with the development of cardiometabolic disorders in a sample of Iranian adult population aged 18-50 years. Valid metabolites were defined as metabolites that passed the quality control analysis of the study. In this case-control study, 104 valid metabolites of 107 MHO and 100 MUHO patients were separately compared to those of 78 normal-weight metabolically healthy (NWMH) adults. Multivariable linear regression was used to investigate all potential relations in the study. A targeted metabolomic approach using liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry was employed to profile plasma metabolites. The study revealed that, after Bonferroni correction, branched-chain amino-acids, , glutamic acid, diacyl-phosphatidylcholines C32:1 and C38:3 were directly and acyl-carnitine C18:2, acyl-lysophosphatidylcholines C18:1 and C18:2, and alkyl-lysophosphatidylcholines C18.0 were inversely associated with MHO phenotype. The same patterns were observed in MUHO patients except for the acyl-carnitine and lysophosphatidylcholine profiles where acyl-carnitine C3:0 and acyl-lysophosphatidylcholine C16:1 were higher and acyl-lysophosphatidylcholines C18:1, C18:2 were lower in this phenotype. Furthermore, proline, and diacyl-phosphatidylcholines C32:2 and C34:2 were directly and serine, asparagines, and acyl-alkyl-phosphatidylcholine C34:3 were negatively linked to MUHO group. Factors composed of amino acids were directly and those containing lysophosphatidylcholines were inversely related to cardiometabolic biomarkers in both phenotypes. Interestingly, the diacyl-phosphatidylcholines-containing factor was directly associated with cardiometabolic disorders in the MUHO group. A particular pattern of amino acids and choline-containing phospholipids may aid in the identification of metabolic health among obese patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191323>Role of Myeloid-Epithelial-Reproductive  Kinase and Macrophage Polarization in the Progression of Atherosclerotic Lesions Associated With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Recent lines of evidence highlight the involvement of myeloid-epithelial-reproductive  kinase (MerTK) in metabolic disease associated with liver damage. MerTK is mainly expressed in anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages where it mediates transcriptional changes including suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancement of inflammatory repressors. MerTK is regulated by metabolic pathways through nuclear sensors including LXRs, PPARs, and RXRs, in response to apoptotic bodies or to other sources of cholesterol. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. It is a clinicopathological syndrome closely related to , insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. It includes a spectrum of conditions ranging from simple steatosis, characterized by hepatic fat accumulation with or without inflammation, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), defined by hepatic fat deposition with hepatocellular damage, inflammation, and accumulating fibrosis. Several studies support an association between NAFLD and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, a major cause of death worldwide. This pathological condition consists in a chronic and progressive inflammatory process in the intimal layer of large- and medium-sized arteries. The complications of advanced atherosclerosis include chronic or acute ischemic damage in the tissue perfused by the affected artery, leading to cellular death. By identifying specific targets influencing lipid metabolism and cardiovascular-related diseases, the present review highlights the role of MerTK in NAFLD-associated atherosclerotic lesions as a potential innovative therapeutic target. Therapeutic advantages might derive from the use of compounds selective for nuclear receptors targeting PPARs rather than LXRs regulating macrophage lipid metabolism and macrophage mediated inflammation, by favoring the expression of MerTK, which mediates an immunoregulatory action with a reduction in inflammation and in atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31237372>RhoA in  hydroxylase neurones regulates food intake and body weight via altered sensitivity to peripheral hormones.</a></h2><p>Dopamine-producing  hydroxylase (TH) neurones in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) have recently been shown to be involved in ghrelin signalling and body weight homeostasis. In the present study, we investigate the role of the intracellular regulator RhoA in hypothalamic TH neurones in response to peripheral hormones. Diet-induced  was found to be associated with increased phosphorylation of TH in ARC, indicating -associated increased activity of ARC TH neurones. Mice in which RhoA was specifically knocked out in TH neurones (TH-RhoA mice) were more sensitive to the orexigenic effect of peripherally administered ghrelin and displayed an abolished response to the anorexigenic hormone leptin. When TH-RhoA mice were challenged with a high-fat high-sucrose (HFHS) diet, they became hyperphagic and gained more body weight and fat mass compared to wild-type control mice. Importantly, lack of RhoA prevented development of ghrelin resistance, which is normally observed in wild-type mice after long-term HFHS diet feeding. Patch-clamp electrophysiological analysis demonstrated increased ghrelin-induced excitability of TH neurones in lean TH-RhoA mice compared to lean littermate control animals. Additionally, increased expression of the orexigenic hypothalamic neuropeptides agouti-related peptide and neuropeptide Y was observed in TH-RhoA mice. Overall, our data indicate that TH neurones in ARC are important for the regulation of body weight homeostasis and that RhoA is both a central effector in these neurones and important for the development of -induced ghrelin resistance. The obese phenotype of TH-RhoA mice may be a result of increased sensitivity to ghrelin and decreased sensitivity to leptin, resulting in increased food intake.© 2019 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29379096>The antidepressant fluoxetine acts on energy balance and leptin sensitivity via BDNF.</a></h2><p>Leptin and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) pathways are critical players in body weight homeostasis. Noninvasive treatments like environmental stimulation are able to increase response to leptin and induce BDNF expression in the brain. Emerging evidences point to the antidepressant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Fluoxetine (FLX) as a drug with effects similar to environmental stimulation. FLX is known to impact on body weight, with mechanisms yet to be elucidated. We herein asked whether FLX affects energy balance, the leptin system and BDNF function. Adult lean male mice chronically treated with FLX showed reduced weight gain, higher energy expenditure, increased sensitivity to acute leptin, increased hypothalamic BDNF expression, associated to changes in white adipose tissue expression typical of "brownization". In the Ntrk2/J model, carrying a mutation in the BDNF receptor  kinase B (TrkB), these effects are partially or totally reversed. Wild type obese mice treated with FLX showed reduced weight gain, increased energy output, and differently from untreated obese mice, a preserved acute response to leptin in terms of activation of the intracellular leptin transducer STAT3. In conclusion, FLX impacts on energy balance and induces leptin sensitivity and an intact TrkB function is required for these effects to take place.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29449326>Fatty acid synthase mediates EGFR palmitoylation in EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>Metabolic reprogramming is widely known as a hallmark of cancer cells to allow adaptation of cells to sustain survival signals. In this report, we describe a novel oncogenic signaling pathway exclusively acting in mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with acquired  kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance. Mutated EGFR mediates TKI resistance through regulation of the fatty acid synthase (FASN), which produces 16-C saturated fatty acid palmitate. Our work shows that the persistent signaling by mutated EGFR in TKI-resistant tumor cells relies on EGFR palmitoylation and can be targeted by Orlistat, an FDA-approved anti- drug. Inhibition of FASN with Orlistat induces EGFR ubiquitination and abrogates EGFR mutant signaling, and reduces tumor growths both in culture systems and  Together, our data provide compelling evidence on the functional interrelationship between mutated EGFR and FASN and that the fatty acid metabolism pathway is a candidate target for acquired TKI-resistant EGFR mutant NSCLC patients.© 2018 The Authors.

In this study, we determined the importance of PTP1B expressed in endothelial cells for the vascular response to arterial injury in .Morphometric analysis of vascular lesions generated by 10% ferric chloride (FeCl) revealed that tamoxifen-inducible endothelial PTP1B deletion (Tie2.ER-Cre × PTP1B; End.PTP1B knockout, KO) significantly increased neointima formation, and reduced numbers of (endothelial lectin-positive) luminal cells in End.PTP1B-KO mice suggested impaired lesion re-endothelialization. Significantly higher numbers of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive proliferating cells as well as smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive or vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1)-positive activated smooth muscle cells or vimentin-positive myofibroblasts were detected in neointimal lesions of End.PTP1B-KO mice, whereas F4/80-positive macrophage numbers did not differ. Activated receptor  kinase and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) signaling and oxidative stress markers were also significantly more abundant in End.PTP1B-KO mouse lesions. Genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of PTP1B in endothelial cells resulted in increased expression of caveolin-1 and oxidative stress, and distinct morphological changes, elevated numbers of senescence-associated β-galactosidase-positive cells, and increased expression of tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53) or the cell cycle inhibitor cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2A (p16INK4A) suggested senescence, all of which could be attenuated by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated downregulation of caveolin-1. In vitro, senescence could be prevented and impaired re-endothelialization restored by preincubation with the antioxidant Trolox.Our results reveal a previously unknown role of PTP1B in endothelial cells and provide mechanistic insights how PTP1B deletion or inhibition may promote endothelial senescence.Absence of PTP1B in endothelial cells impairs re-endothelialization, and the failure to induce smooth muscle cell quiescence or to protect from circulating growth factors may result in neointimal hyperplasia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593979>PKG1α oxidation negatively regulates food seeking behaviour and reward.</a></h2><p>Genes that are highly conserved in food seeking behaviour, such as protein kinase G (PKG), are of interest because of their potential role in the global  epidemic. PKG1α can be activated by binding of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) or oxidant-induced interprotein disulfide bond formation between the two subunits of this homodimeric kinase. PKG1α activation by cGMP plays a role in reward and addiction through its actions in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the brain. 'Redox dead' C42S PKG1α knock-in (KI) mice, which are fully deficient in oxidant-induced disulfide-PKG1α formation, display increased food seeking and reward behaviour compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. Rewarding monoamines such as dopamine, which are released during feeding, are metabolised by monoamine oxidase to generate hydrogen peroxide that was shown to mediate PKG1α oxidation. Indeed, inhibition of monoamine oxidase, which prevents it producing hydrogen peroxide, attenuated PKG1α oxidation and increased sucrose preference in WT, but not KI mice. The deficient reward phenotype of the KI mice was rescued by expressing WT kinase that can form the disulfide state in the VTA using an adeno-associated virus, consistent with PKG1α oxidation providing a break on feeding behaviour. In conclusion, disulfide-PKG1α in VTA neurons acts as a negative regulator of feeding and therefore may provide a novel therapeutic target for .Copyright © 2018.

Chronic inflammation is considered part of the pathogenic mechanisms of different disorders associated with aging. Interestingly, peripheral inflammation and the associated metabolic alterations not only facilitate insulin resistance and diabetes but also neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, the identification of novel pathways, common to the development of these diseases, which modulate the immune response and signaling is key. It will provide highly relevant information to advance our knowledge of the multifactorial process of aging, and to establish new biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets to counteract the underlying chronic inflammatory processes. One novel pathway that regulates peripheral and central immune responses is triggered by the cytokines pleiotrophin (PTN) and midkine (MK), which bind its receptor, Receptor Protein  Phosphatase (RPTP) β/ζ, and inactivate its phosphatase activity. In this review, we compile a growing body of knowledge suggesting that PTN and MK modulate the immune response and/or inflammation in different pathologies characterized by peripheral inflammation associated with insulin resistance, such as aging, and in central disorders characterized by overt neuroinflammation, such as neurodegenerative diseases and endotoxemia. Evidence strongly suggests that regulation of the PTN and MK signaling pathways may provide new therapeutic opportunities particularly in those neurological disorders characterized by increased PTN and/or MK cerebral levels and neuroinflammation. Importantly, we discuss existing therapeutics, and others being developed, that modulate these signaling pathways, and their potential use in pathologies characterized by overt neuroinflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31220223>The Effects of Graded Levels of Calorie Restriction: XIV. Global Metabolomics Screen Reveals Brown Adipose Tissue Changes in Amino Acids, Catecholamines, and Antioxidants After Short-Term Restriction in C57BL/6 Mice.</a></h2><p>Animals undergoing calorie restriction (CR) often lower their body temperature to conserve energy. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is stimulated through norepinephrine when rapid heat production is needed, as it is highly metabolically active due to the uncoupling of the electron transport chain from ATP synthesis. To better understand how BAT metabolism changes with CR, we used metabolomics to identify 883 metabolites that were significantly differentially expressed in the BAT of C57BL/6 mice, fed graded CR (10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% CR relative to their individual baseline intake), compared with mice fed ad libitum (AL) for 12 hours a day. Pathway analysis revealed that graded CR had an impact on the TCA cycle and fatty acid degradation. In addition, an increase in nucleic acids and catecholamine pathways was seen with graded CR in the BAT metabolome. We saw increases in antioxidants with CR, suggesting a beneficial effect of mitochondrial uncoupling. Importantly, the instigator of BAT activation, norepinephrine, was increased with CR, whereas its precursors  and dopamine were decreased, indicating a shift of metabolites through the activation pathway. Several of these key changes were correlated with food anticipatory activity and body temperature, indicating BAT activation may be driven by responses to hunger.© The Author(s) 2019.

Obese women experience decreased fertility, explained in part by oocyte quality. Since follicular fluid (FF) provides an important microenvironment for oocyte growth, we sought to evaluate the effect of increased body weight on FF levels of 11 metabolic hormones and fatty acid metabolism.The FF was collected from 25 women (10 normal weight, 10 overweight, and 5 obese) with diminished ovarian reserve undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) following a minimal stimulation protocol. Hormone levels were determined by multiplex immunoassay using the MAGPIX (Luminex, Austin, Texas) instrument. Fatty acid metabolites were determined using gas and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.Levels of hormones related to glucose and energy homeostasis and regulation of fat stores (insulin, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1, C-peptide, and leptin) were increased significantly in FF from obese women compared to FF from nonobese(normal weight and overweight) women. Interestingly, FF levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) isoleucine, leucine, and valine as well as uric acid, isocaproic acid, butanoic acid, , threonine, glycine, and methionine correlated positively with body mass index.This pilot study demonstrates significant alterations in the FF milieu of obese women undergoing IVF, which may contribute to the decreased fecundity of obese women.

Another HFD group additionally received ChOi from 90 to 135 d.Consumption of ChOi reduced fat mass accumulation and increased lean mass as evidenced by nuclear magnetic resonance. Moreover, obese mice treated with ChOi showed higher  phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1, greater activation of protein kinase B, and increased translocation of glucose transporter type 4 in skeletal muscle tissue in response to insulin. ChOi supplementation improved glucose levels and insulin tolerance; decreased serum insulin, leptin, and triacylglycerols; and increased blood high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.

However, improving the selectivity of PTP1B inhibitors over the most closely related T-cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP) remains a major challenge for inhibitor development. Lys120 at the active site and Ser27 at the second pTyr binding site are distinct in PTP1B and TCPTP, which may bring differences in binding affinity. To explore the determinant of selective binding of inhibitor, molecular dynamics simulations with binding free energy calculations were performed on K120A and A27S mutated PTP1B, and the internal changes induced by mutations were investigated. Results reveal that the presence of Lys120 induces a conformational change in the WPD-loop and YRD-motif and has a certain effect on the selective binding at the active site. Ser27 weakens the stability of the inhibitor at the second pTyr binding site by altering the orientation of the Arg24 and Arg254 side chains via hydrogen bonds. Further comparison of alanine scanning demonstrates that the reduction in the energy contribution of Arg254 caused by A27S mutation leads to a different inhibitory activity.

Although brown adipocytes have been highlighted as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic diseases, such as  and type II diabetes in adult humans, the molecular mechanism underlying brown adipogenesis is not fully understood. We recently found that protein  phosphatase receptor type B (PTPRB) expression dramatically decreased during brown adipogenic differentiation. In this study, we investigated the functional roles of PTPRB and its regulatory mechanism during brown adipocyte differentiation. Ectopic expression of PTPRB led to a reduced brown adipocyte differentiation by suppressing the  phosphorylation of VEGFR2, whereas a catalytic inactive PTPRB mutant showed no effects on differentiation and phosphorylation. Consistently, the expression of brown adipocyte-related genes, such as UCP-1, PGC-1α, PRDM16, PPAR-γ, and CIDEA, were significantly inhibited by PTPRB overexpression.

However, the lack of selectivity over other PTPs, especially for T-cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP), is still a challenge for inhibitor development. Recent studies have suggested that the second phosphotyrosine (pTyr) binding site, close to the catalytic domain, may elevate binding affinity while bringing selectivity to inhibitors. Inspired by these studies, a virtual screening method based on a bidentate strategy was employed to identify novel selective inhibitors of PTP1B. Targeting both the active site and the second pTyr binding site of PTP1B, three compounds (CD00466, JFD02943, JFD02945) were found to be competitive inhibitors ( K range from 1.79 to 10.49 μM).

Outcome measurements of metabolic responses, inflammatory markers and gut bacterial composition were analysed at the end of each 42-day supplementation period.Both IPE and inulin supplementation improved insulin resistance compared with cellulose supplementation, measured by homeostatic model assessment 2 (mean±SEM 1.23±0.17 IPE vs 1.59±0.17 cellulose, p=0.001; 1.17±0.15 inulin vs 1.59±0.17 cellulose, p=0.009), with no differences between IPE and inulin (p=0.272). Fasting insulin was only associated positively with plasma  and negatively with plasma glycine following inulin supplementation. IPE supplementation decreased proinflammatory interleukin-8 levels compared with cellulose, while inulin had no impact on the systemic inflammatory markers studied. Inulin promoted changes in gut bacterial populations at the class level (increased Actinobacteria and decreased Clostridia) and order level (decreased Clostridiales) compared with cellulose, with small differences at the species level observed between IPE and cellulose.These data demonstrate a distinctive physiological impact of raising colonic propionate delivery in humans, as improvements in insulin sensitivity promoted by IPE and inulin were accompanied with different effects on the plasma metabolome, gut bacterial populations and markers of systemic inflammation.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Mutations within their catalytic signature motif render them catalytically inactive. Despite this lack of catalytic function, pseudophosphatases have been implicated in various diseases such as Charcot Marie-Tooth disorder, cancer, metabolic disorder, and . Moreover, they have roles in various signaling networks such as spermatogenesis, apoptosis, stress response, tumorigenesis, and neurite differentiation. This review highlights the roles of pseudophosphatases as essential regulators in signaling cascades, providing insight into the function of these catalytically inactive enzymes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Insulin modulates the central dopaminergic response and changes behavioral responses to reward. We measured the release of dopamine in the accumbens during palatable food intake in IUGR rats both at baseline and in response to insulin. From pregnancy day 10 until birth, gestating Sprague-Dawley rats received either an ad libitum (Control), or a 50% food restricted (FR) diet. In adulthood, palatable food consumption and feeding behavior entropy was assessed using an electronic food intake monitor (BioDAQ®), and dopamine response to palatable food was measured by chronoamperometry recordings in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). FR rats eat more palatable foods during the dark phase, and their eating pattern has a higher entropy compared to control rats. There was a delayed dopamine release in the FR group in response to palatable food and insulin administration reverted this delayed effect. Western blot showed a decrease in suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 protein (SOCS3) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and an increase in the ratio of phospho- hydroxylase to  hydroxylase (pTH/TH) in the NAcc of FR rats. Administration of insulin also abolished this latter effect in FR rats. FR rats showed metabolic alterations and a delay in the dopaminergic response to palatable foods. This could explain the increased palatable food intake and behavioral entropy found in FR rats. IUGR may lead to binge eating,  and its metabolic consequences by modifying the central dopaminergic response to sweet food.Copyright © 2018 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The endocannabinoid system is a widespread neuromodulatory system involved in multiple functions including learning and memory processes. Alterations of this system contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in the pathogenesis of Down syndrome has not been explored before. We used the best-characterized preclinical model of Down syndrome, the segmentally trisomic Ts65Dn model. In male Ts65Dn mice, cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) expression was enhanced and its function increased in hippocampal excitatory terminals. Knockdown of CB1R in the hippocampus of male Ts65Dn mice restored hippocampal-dependent memory. Concomitant with this result, pharmacological inhibition of CB1R restored memory deficits, hippocampal synaptic plasticity and adult neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. Notably, the blockade of CB1R also normalized hippocampal-dependent memory in female Ts65Dn mice. To further investigate the mechanisms involved, we used a second transgenic mouse model overexpressing a single gene candidate for Down syndrome cognitive phenotypes, the dual specificity -phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A). CB1R pharmacological blockade similarly improved cognitive performance, synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis in transgenic male Dyrk1A mice. Our results identify CB1R as a novel druggable target potentially relevant for the improvement of cognitive deficits associated with Down syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The major contributors in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) include resistance to insulin action, β cell dysfunction, an abnormality in glucose metabolism and storage, visceral  and to some extent inflammation and oxidative stress. Insulin resistance, along with a defect in insulin secretion by the pancreatic β cells is instrumental towards progression to hyperglycemia. Increased incidence of  is also a major contributing factor in the escalating rates of type 2 diabetes. Drug discovery efforts are therefore crucially dependent on identifying individual molecular targets and validating their relevance to human disease. The current review discusses bioactive compounds from medicinal plants offering enhanced therapeutic potential for the combined patho-physiology of diabetes and . We have demonstrated that 3β-taraxerol a pentacyclic triterpenoid (14-taraxeren-3-ol) isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of Mangifera indica, chlorogenic acid isolated from the methanol extract of Cichorium intybus, methyl tetracosanoate from the methanol extract of Costus pictus and vitalboside A derived from methanolic extract of Syzygium cumini exhibited significant effects on insulin stimulated glucose uptake causing insulin sensitizing effects on 3T3L1 adipocytes (an in vitro model mimicking adipocytes). Whereas, (3β)-stigmast-5-en-3-ol isolated from Adathoda vasica and Aloe emodin isolated from Cassia fistula showed significant insulin mimetic effects favoring glucose uptake in L6 myotubes (an in vitro model mimicking skeletal muscle cells). These extracts and molecules showed glucose uptake through activation of PI3K, an important insulin signaling intermediate. Interestingly, cinnamic acid isolated from the hydro-alcohol extract of Cinnamomum cassia was found to activate glucose transport in L6 myotubes through the involvement of GLUT4 via the PI3K-independent pathway. However, the activation of glucose storage was effective in the presence of 3β-taraxerol and aloe emodin though inhibition of GSK3β activity. Therefore, the mechanism of improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism exhibited by the small molecules isolated from our lab is discussed. However,  is a major risk factor for type-2 diabetes leading to destruction of insulin receptors causing insulin resistance. Identification of compounds with dual activity (anti-diabetic and antiadipogenic activity) is of current interest. The protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is an important negative regulator of the insulin and leptin-signaling pathway is of significance in target definition and discovery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30753112>Amino acid and fatty acid metabolomic profile during fasting and hyperinsulinemia in girls with polycystic ovarian syndrome.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is associated with insulin resistance (IR) and altered muscle mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. IR in adults with  and diabetes is associated with changes in amino acid, free fatty acid (FFA), and mitochondrial acylcarnitine (AC) metabolism. We sought to determine whether these metabolites are associated with IR and/or androgens in youth-onset PCOS. We enrolled obese girls with PCOS [ n = 15, 14.5 yr (SD 1.6), %BMI 98.5 (SD 1.0)] and without PCOS [ n = 6, 13.2 yr (SD 1.2), %BMI 98.0 (SD 1.1)]. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Untargeted metabolomics of plasma was performed while fasting and during hyperinsulinemia. Fasting arginine, glutamine, histidine, lysine, phenylalanine, and  were higher ( P < 0.04 for all but P < 0.001 for valine), as were glutamine and histidine during hyperinsulinemia ( P < 0.03). Higher valine during hyperinsulinemia was associated with IR ( r = 0.59, P = 0.006). Surprisingly, end-clamp AC C4 was lower in PCOS, and lower C4 was associated with IR ( r = -0.44, P = 0.04). End-clamp FFAs of C14:0, C16:1, and C18:1 were higher in PCOS girls, and C16:1 and C18:1 strongly associated with IR ( r = 0.73 and 0.53, P < 0.01). Free androgen index related negatively to short-, medium-, and long-chain AC ( r = -0.41 to -0.71, P < 0.01) but not FFA or amino acids. Obese girls with PCOS have a distinct metabolic signature during fasting and hyperinsulinemia. As in diabetes, IR related to valine and FFAs, with an unexpected relationship with AC C4, suggesting unique metabolism in obese girls with PCOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30088983>High-fat diet-induced  and insulin resistance in CYP4a14 mice is mediated by 20-HETE.</a></h2><p>20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) has been shown to positively correlate with body mass index, hyperglycemia, and plasma insulin levels. This study seeks to identify a causal relationship between 20-HETE and -driven insulin resistance. Cyp4a14 male mice, a model of 20-HETE overproduction, were fed a regular or high-fat diet (HFD) for 15 wk. 20-SOLA [2,5,8,11,14,17-hexaoxanonadecan-19-yl 20-hydroxyeicosa-6( Z),15( Z)-dienoate], a 20-HETE antagonist, was administered from week 0 or week 7 of HFD. HFD-fed mice gained significant weight (16.7 ± 3.2 vs. 3.8 ± 0.35 g, P < 0.05) and developed hyperglycemia (157 ± 3 vs. 121 ± 7 mg/dl, P < 0.05) and hyperinsulinemia (2.3 ± 0.4 vs. 0.5 ± 0.1 ng/ml, P < 0.05) compared with regular diet-fed mice. 20-SOLA attenuated HFD-induced weight gain (9.4 ± 1 vs. 16.7 ± 3 g, P < 0.05) and normalized the hyperglycemia (157 ± 7 vs. 102 ± 5 mg/dl, P < 0.05) and hyperinsulinemia (1.1 ± 0.1 vs. 2.3 ± 0.4 ng/ml, P < 0.05). The impaired glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance in HFD-fed mice evidenced by reduced insulin and glucose tolerance were also ameliorated by 20-SOLA. Circulatory and adipose tissue 20-HETE levels significantly increased in HFD-fed mice correlating with impaired insulin signaling, including reduction in insulin receptor  (Y972) phosphorylation and increased serine (S307) phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). 20-SOLA treatments prevented changes in insulin signaling. These findings indicate that 20-HETE contributes to HFD-induced , insulin resistance, and impaired insulin signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31212279>Estradiol Protects Neuropeptide Y/Agouti-related Peptide Neurons against Insulin Resistance in Females.</a></h2><p>With  men exhibit a higher incidence of metabolic syndrome than women in early adult life, but this sex advantage wanes in postmenopausal women. A key diagnostic of the metabolic syndrome is insulin resistance in both peripheral tissues and brain, especially in the hypothalamus. Since the anorexigenic hormone 17β-estradiol (E2) regulates food intake in part by inhibiting the excitability of the hypothalamic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons, we hypothesized that E2 would protect against insulin resistance in NPY/AgRP neurons with diet-induced  (DIO). Therefore, we did whole-cell recordings and single cell qPCR in arcuate NPYGFP neurons from both female and male mice to test the efficacy of insulin with DIO. The resting membrane potential and input resistance of NPY/AgRP neurons was significantly increased in DIO versus control-diet fed males. Most notably, the efficacy of insulin to activate KATP channels in NPY/AgRP neurons was significantly attenuated, although the KATP channel opener diazoxide was fully effective in NPY/AgRP neurons from DIO males, indicating that the KATP channels were expressed and functional. In contrast, insulin was fully efficacious to activate KATP channels in DIO females, and the response was reversed by the KATP channel blocker tolbutamide. However, the ability of insulin to activate KATP channels was abrogated with ovariectomy but fully restored with E2 replacement. The insulin resistance in obese males was likely mediated by an increase in suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3), protein  phosphatase B (PTP1B) and T cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP) activity since the expression of all three mRNAs were upregulated in the obese males but not in females. As proof of principle, pre-incubation of hypothalamic slices from DIO males with the PTP1B/TCPTP inhibitor CX08005 completely rescued the effects of insulin. Therefore, E2 protects NPY/AgRP neurons in females against insulin resistance through, at least in part, attenuating phosphatase activity. The neuroprotective effects of E2 may explain sex differences in the expression of metabolic syndrome with aging.© 2019 S.

This study identifies the protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) as a potential modulator of islet graft revascularization. We demonstrate that grafts of pancreatic islets lacking PTP1B exhibit increased revascularization, which is accompanied by improved graft survival and function, and recovery of normoglycemia and glucose tolerance in diabetic mice transplanted with PTP1B-deficient islets. Mechanistically, we show that the absence of PTP1B leads to activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α-independent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α/estrogen-related receptor α signaling and enhanced expression and production of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) by β cells. These observations were reproduced in human islets. Together, these findings reveal that PTP1B regulates islet VEGF-A production and suggest that this phosphatase could be targeted to improve islet transplantation outcomes.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Here, we report that mice without CDP138 develop  under normal chow diet (NCD) or high-fat diet (HFD) conditions. CDP138 mice have lower energy expenditure, oxygen consumption, and body temperature than wild-type (WT) mice. CDP138 is exclusively expressed in adrenal medulla and is colocalized with  hydroxylase (TH), a marker of sympathetic nervous terminals, in the inguinal fat. Compared with WT controls, CDP138 mice had altered catecholamine levels in circulation, adrenal gland, and inguinal fat. Adrenergic signaling on cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) phosphorylation induced by cold challenge but not by an exogenous β3 adrenoceptor against CL316243 were decreased in adipose tissues of CDP138 mice. Cold-induced beige fat browning, fatty acid oxidation, thermogenesis, and related gene expression were reduced in CDP138 mice. CDP138 mice are also prone to HFD-induced insulin resistance, as assessed by Akt phosphorylation and glucose transport in skeletal muscles. Our data indicate that CDP138 is a regulator of stress response and plays a significant role in adipose tissue browning, energy balance, and insulin sensitivity through regulating catecholamine secretion from the sympathetic nervous terminals and adrenal gland.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29763203>Immunodeficiency.</a></h2><p>Immunodeficiency results from a failure or absence of elements of the immune system including lymphocytes, phagocytes and complement system. These immunodeficiencies can be either primary such as Bruton’s disease or secondary as the one caused by HIV infection.[1][2]   : First described by Bruton. X-linked disorder. Found in male babies expressed around 5 to 6 months of age (maternal IgG disappears). In boys, pre-B cells did not differentiate into mature B lymphocytes. There is a mutation in the gene that encodes for a  kinase protein. Low level of all immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD and IgE) is present. Infants with X-linked agammaglobulinemia suffer from recurrent bacterial infections: otitis media, bronchitis, septicemia, pneumonia, and arthritis, and  causes intestinal malabsorption. Intermittent injections of large amounts of IgG keep the patient alive, but a patient may die at a younger age if infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria occurs. Bone marrow transplantation is critical. : IgA deficiency is more common than other deficiencies of immunoglobulins.[4]. These patients are more prone to recurrent sinus and lung infections. A malfunctioning in heavy-chain gene switching may cause this problem. Treatment should not include gammaglobulin preparations to prevent hypersensitivity reactions.   : Tetany is present. Fungal and viral infections are common. A transplant of the fetal thymus is needed to correct this deficiency. : Selective defect in functioning of T-cells.  Patient with this disorder usually have a normal T-cell mediated immunity to microorganisms other than . B-cells function is normal. Disorders affect both genders, and it is inherited. Patient in addition to the above will have other disorders like parathyroid deficiencies. Antifungals are useful. : This disorder is characterized by bacterial infections including pneumonia, meningitis, otitis, among others that start in early childhood. High levels of IgM. Other immunoglobulins are defective. Lymphocytes are normal in numbers. The gene encoding the CD40 ligand on T lymphocytes is faulty. B and T lymphocyte cooperation in the immune response is compromised. The failure to interact with CD40 results in an inability of the B cell to switch from the production of IgM to the other classes of antibodies. Immunoglobulin therapy is recommended. : Mycobacterial infections are frequent due to the lack of the interleukin-12 receptor. Treatment involves selective antimicrobials.  : There is a failure of early stem cells to differentiate into T and B lymphocytes.   Deficiency of the interleukin-2 receptor is the most prevalent.   Other problems are due to defective genes encoding ZAP-70, Janus kinase 3 and the genes involved in the DNA recombination of immune cells receptors:  and . Clinically characterized by a variety of infections, including those caused by opportunistic pathogens. Selective antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals are available after the pathogen identification. Immunosuppressive therapy is not needed after allograft transplantation. : This syndrome is associated with normal T-cell numbers with reduced functions, which get progressively worse. IgM concentrations are reduced, but IgG levels are normal. Both IgA and IgE levels are elevated. These patients have a defective WASP which is involved in actin filament assembly. : This is a deficiency of T-cells associated with a lack of coordination of movement (ataxia) and dilation of small blood vessels of the facial area (telangiectasis). T-cells and their functions are diminished to various degrees. B-cell numbers and IgM concentrations are normal to low.  IgG is often reduced, and IgA is considerably reduced. There is a high incidence of malignancy, especially leukemias, in these patients. : This subjects have have fewer CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocytes that predispose to these individuals to be prone to recurrent infections. Antibody production is affected and predispose to bacteremia.  : This disease has an autosomal dominant genetic pattern. Caused by C1 inhibitor deficiency. Clinically characterized by generalized edema including the one leading to acute suffocation. Therapy with oxymetholone and danazol can be helpful in correcting the defect. : Frequent infections by extracellular bacteria may be caused by C3 deficiency. C5 deficiency predisposes to viral infections.  Patients with deficiency of the membrane attack complex (MAC) are particularly susceptible to bacteremia caused by species.    This are caused by C2 and C4 deficiencies and mimic systemic lupus erythematosus.  : It is mostly an X-linked disorder.    It is clinically characterized by a defective NADPH that interferes with the intracellular ability of neutrophils to kill engulfed bacteria species. NAPDH oxidase is required for the generation of peroxidase and superoxides that will kill the organisms. The intracellular survival of the organisms leads to the formation of a granuloma, an organized structure consisting of mononuclear cells. These granulomas can become large enough to obstruct the stomach, esophagus, or bladder. Patients with this disease are very susceptible to opportunistic infection by certain bacteria and fungi especially with  and .   Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) dye reduction test confirms the diagnosis of CGD and the dichlorofluorescein (DCF) test is also useful.  Aggressive therapy with wide spectrum antibiotics and antifungal agents is required.  : Characterized by pyogenic infections including pneumonia and otitis. It is an autosomal recessive disease, and the faulty gene encodes for an integrin. There is an impaired adhesion and defective phagocytosis of bacteria. Treatment involves the use of selective antibiotics.  : Administration of steroids has direct effects on immune cell traffic and functions. T cells are more affected than B cells. Cytokine synthesis is inhibited. : They are associated with impaired immune system. Affects cell-mediated immunity, antibody production, phagocyte function, complement system and cytokine synthesis. Aggravated by infections. Multiple enzymes with important roles require zinc, iron and other micronutrients. : It may cause impaired immune responses. There is altered NK function. Cytotoxicity is compromised and the ability of phagocytes to kill microorganisms. : Caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is a retrovirus transmitted sexually, perinatally or blood products. Immune dysfunction results from the direct effects of HIV and impairment of CD4 T cells. HIV proteins may act as superantigens. There is decreased responses to antigens and mitogens.

Both anorexigenic (appetite-decreasing) and orexigenic (appetite-stimulating) neuropeptides have been described. The biological effects of these neuropeptides can be observed following central administration in animal models. This review focuses on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six orexigenic neuropeptides: agouti-related protein (AGRP), galanin, melanin concentrating hormone (MCH), neuropeptide Y (NPY), orexin A, and orexin B.

However, the pathological mechanisms underlying the development of leptin resistance are not well-understood. This study aimed to examine the pathological mechanisms of leptin resistance in . In the present study, we found that 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), an aldehyde, may be involved in the development of leptin resistance. The SH-SY5Y-Ob-Rb human neuroblastoma cell line, transfected to express the Ob-Rb leptin receptor stably, was treated with 4-HNE, and leptin-induced signal transduction was analyzed. We found that 4-HNE dose- and time-dependently inhibited leptin-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation, a major antiobesity signal of leptin. On the other hand, 4-HNE did not affect  phosphorylation of broad cellular proteins, suggesting that the inhibitory effect may be selective to leptin signaling. Mechanistically, 4-HNE induced the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α-CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein arm of endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of leptin resistance. Overall, these results suggest that 4-HNE may partly affect endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced unfolded protein response signaling and may be involved in the pathogenesis of leptin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679477>Beneficial effects of murtilla extract and madecassic acid on insulin sensitivity and endothelial function in a model of diet-induced .</a></h2><p>Infusions of murtilla leaves exhibit antioxidant, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties.

Leptin has emerged as a major regulator of energy balance through its actions in the hypothalamus. Importantly, obese people exhibit high circulating levels of leptin, yet the hypothalamus no longer responds normally to this hormone to suppress appetite or to increase energy expenditure. Several well-known hypotheses have been proposed to explain impaired central responsiveness to the effects of leptin in , including defective transit across the blood-brain barrier at the arcuate nucleus, hypothalamic endoplasmic reticulum stress, maladaptive sterile inflammation in the hypothalamus, and overexpression of molecules that may inhibit leptin signaling. We also discuss a new explanation that is based on our group's recent discovery of a signaling pathway that we named "NSAPP" after its five main protein components. The NSAPP pathway consists of an oxide transport chain that causes a transient, targeted burst in intracellular hydrogen peroxide (HO) to inactivate redox-sensitive members of the protein  phosphatase gene family. The NSAPP oxide transport chain is required for full activation of canonical leptin signaling in neurons but fails to function normally in states of overnutrition. Remarkably, leptin and insulin both require the NSAPP oxide transport chain, suggesting that a defect in this pathway could explain simultaneous resistance to the appetite-suppressing effects of both hormones in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30126894>Transient Overexpression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A in Adipose Tissue Promotes Energy Expenditure via Activation of the Sympathetic Nervous System.</a></h2><p>Adipose-derived vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) stimulates functional blood vessel formation in obese fat pads, which in turn facilitates healthy expansion of the adipose tissue. However, the detailed mechanism(s) governing the process remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of sympathetic nervous system activation in the process. To this end, we induced overexpression of VEGF-A in an adipose tissue-specific doxycycline (Dox)-inducible transgenic mouse model for a short period of time during high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. We found that local overexpression of VEGF-A in adipose tissue stimulated lipolysis and browning rapidly after Dox induction. Immunofluorescence staining against  hydroxylase (TH) indicated higher levels of sympathetic innervation in adipose tissue of transgenic mice. In response to an increased norepinephrine (NE) level, expression of β3-adrenoceptor was significantly upregulated, and the downstream protein kinase A (PKA) pathway was activated, as indicated by enhanced phosphorylation of whole PKA substrates, in particular, the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in adipocytes. As a result, the adipose tissue exhibited increased lipolysis, browning, and energy expenditure. Importantly, all of these effects were abolished upon treatment with the β3-adrenoceptor antagonist SR59230A. Collectively, these results demonstrate that transient overexpressed VEGF-A activates the sympathetic nervous system, which hence promotes lipolysis and browning in adipose tissue.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30352954>Increased FGF21 in brown adipose tissue of  hydroxylase heterozygous mice: implications for cold adaptation.</a></h2><p> hydroxylase (TH) catalyzes the first step in catecholamines synthesis. We studied the impact of reduced TH in brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation. In adult heterozygous ( ) mice, dopamine and noradrenaline (NA) content in BAT decreased after cold exposure. This reduced catecholaminergic response did not impair cold adaptation, because these mice induced uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) and maintained BAT temperature to a similar extent than controls ( ). Possible compensatory mechanisms implicated were studied.  and  expression, key genes in BAT activation, were elevated in  mice at thermoneutrality from day 18.5 of embryonic life. Likewise, plasma FGF21 and liver  mRNA were increased. Analysis of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a process that triggers elevations in FGF21, showed higher phospho-IRE1, phospho-JNK, and CHOP in BAT of  mice at thermoneutrality. Also, increased lipolysis in BAT of cold-exposure  mice was demonstrated by increased phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), as well as diacylglycerol (DAG) and FFA content. Overall, these results indicate that the mild effects of  haploinsufficiency on BAT function are likely due to compensatory mechanisms involving elevations in  and  and through adaptive changes in the lipid profile.Copyright © 2018 Vázquez et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893514>GC-(4→8)-GCG, A Proanthocyanidin Dimer from Camellia ptilophylla, Modulates  and Adipose Tissue Inflammation in High-Fat Diet Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>Excessive fat accumulation in adipose tissue leads to  and related chronic inflammation. This study aims to examine the effects of gallocatechin -(4→8)-gallocatechin-3-O-gallate (GC-(4→8)-GCG), a main proanthocyanidin dimer from Camellia ptilophylla (Cocoa tea), on adipocyte- and adipose-related inflammation in vivo and in vitro.C57BL/6 mice are fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and GC-(4→8)-GCG (40 or 80 mg kg d ) for 8 weeks. The metabolic profiles, adipose tissue hypertrophy, macrophage infiltration, and inflammatory cytokine production are investigated. Additionally, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes are utilized to investigate the effect of GC-(4→8)-GCG on preadipocyte differentiation and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-stimulated inflammatory response in vitro. GC-(4→8)-GCG supplementation decreases HFD-induced epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) hypertrophy, suppresses proinflammatory cytokine production and macrophage infiltration in eWAT, and improves insulin sensitivity in HFD-induced obese mice. In vitro, GC-(4→8)-GCG shows a strong anti-adipogenic potential in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte by inhibiting the expression of key adipogenic transcription factors and decreasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB, Janus  kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT3) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.GC-(4→8)-GCG can modulate  and improve -related insulin resistance by inhibiting preadipocyte differentiation and the related proinflammatory responses.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the psychological impact of these surgeries has not been fully studied. On one hand, surgical weight loss has been reported to improve standard quality of life and resolution of symptoms of depression. But on the other hand, reports of self-harm and increased ER visits for self-harm suggest other psychological difficulties. Inability to handle anxiety following surgical weight loss has alarming potential ramifications for these gastric surgery patients. In the present study, we used models of diet-induced  and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) to ask whether anxiety behavior and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis gene changes were affected by surgical weight loss under two diet regimens: i.e. low-fat diet (LFD) and high-fat diet (HFD). We show reduced exploratory behavior in the open field test but increased time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze. Furthermore, we show increased plasma levels of corticosterone in female VSG recipients in the estrus phase and increased levels of hypothalamic arginine-vasopressin (avp), pro-opiomelanocortin (pomc), and  hydroxylase (th). We report reduced dopamine receptor D1 (drd1) gene in prefrontal cortex (PFC) in VSG animals in comparison to Sham. Further we report diet-driven changes in stress-relevant gene targets in the hypothalamus (oxt, pomc, crhr1) and adrenal (nr3c1, nr3c2, mc2r). Taken together, these data suggest a significant impact of both surgical weight loss and diet on the HPA axis and further impact on behavior. Additional assessment is necessary to determine whether molecular and hormonal changes of surgical weight loss are the source of these findings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30915029>Acipimox Administration With Exercise Induces a Co-feedback Action of the GH, PP, and PYY on Ghrelin Associated With a Reduction of Peripheral Lipolysis in Bulimic and Healthy-Weight Czech Women: A Randomized Study.</a></h2><p> Anti-lipolytic drugs and exercise are enhancers of growth hormone (GH) secretion. Decreased circulating free fatty acids (FFA) have been proposed to exert ghrelin-GH feedback loop after administration of an anti-lipolytic longer-acting analog of nicotinic acid, Acipimox (OLB, 5-Methylpyrazine-2-carboxylic acid 4-oxide, molecular weight of 154.1 Da). OLB administration strongly suppresses plasma FFA during exercise. Neuroendocrine perturbations of the adipose tissue (AT), gut, and brain peptides may be involved in the etiopathogenesis of eating disorders including bulimia nervosa (BN) and anorexia nervosa. BN is characterized by binge eating, self-induced vomiting or excessive exercise.  To test the hypothesis that treatment with OLB together with exercise vs. exercise alone would induce feedback action of GH, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), peptide   (PYY), and leptin on ghrelin in Czech women with BN and in healthy-weight Czech women (HW). The lipolysis rate (as glycerol release) in subcutaneous abdominal AT was assessed with microdialysis. At an academic medical center, 12 BN and 12 HW (the control group) were randomized to OLB 500 mg 1 h before a single exercise bout (45 min, 2 W/kg of lean body mass [LBM]) once a week vs. identical placebo over a total of 2 weeks. Blood plasma concentrations of GH, PP, PYY, leptin, ghrelin, FFA, glycerol, and concentrations of AT interstitial glycerol were estimated during the test by RIA utilizing I-labeled tracer, the electrochemiluminescence technique (ECLIA) or colorimetric kits.  OLB administration together with short-term exercise significantly increased plasma GH ( < 0.0001), PP ( < 0.0001), PYY, and leptin concentrations and significantly decreased plasma ghrelin ( < 0.01) concentrations in both groups, whereas short-term exercise with placebo resulted in plasma ghrelin ( < 0.05) decrease exclusively in BN. OLB administration together with short-term exercise significantly lowered local subcutaneous abdominal AT interstitial glycerol ( < 0.0001) to a greater extent in BN.  OLB-induced suppression of plasma ghrelin concentrations together with short-term exercise and after the post-exercise recovering phase suggests a potential negative co-feedback of GH, PP, PYY, and leptin on ghrelin secretion to a greater extent in BN. Simultaneously, the exercise-induced elevation in AT interstitial glycerol leading to a higher inhibition of peripheral lipolysis by OLB in BN.  www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387265>Analysis of Tks4 Knockout Mice Suggests a Role for Tks4 in Adipose Tissue Homeostasis in the Context of Beigeing.</a></h2><p> and adipocyte malfunction are related to and arise as consequences of disturbances in signaling pathways.  kinase substrate with four Src homology 3 domains (Tks4) is a scaffold protein that establishes a platform for signaling cascade molecules during podosome formation and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Several lines of evidence have also suggested that Tks4 has a role in adipocyte biology; however, its roles in the various types of adipocytes at the cellular level and in transcriptional regulation have not been studied. Therefore, we hypothesized that Tks4 functions as an organizing molecule in signaling networks that regulate adipocyte homeostasis. Our aims were to study the white and brown adipose depots of Tks4 knockout (KO) mice using immunohistology and western blotting and to analyze gene expression changes regulated by the white, brown, and beige adipocyte-related transcription factors via a PCR array. Based on morphological differences in the Tks4-KO adipocytes and increased uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of Tks4-KO mice, we concluded that the beigeing process was more robust in the WAT of Tks4-KO mice compared to the wild-type animals. Furthermore, in the Tks4-KO WAT, the expression profile of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)-regulated adipogenesis-related genes was shifted in favor of the appearance of beige-like cells. These results suggest that Tks4 and its downstream signaling partners are novel regulators of adipocyte functions and PPARγ-directed white to beige adipose tissue conversion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31516082>The expanding phenotypes of cohesinopathies: one ring to rule them all!</a></h2><p>Preservation and development of life depend on the adequate segregation of sister chromatids during mitosis and meiosis. This process is ensured by the cohesin multi-subunit complex. Mutations in this complex have been associated with an increasing number of diseases, termed cohesinopathies. The best characterized cohesinopathy is Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), in which intellectual and growth retardations are the main phenotypic manifestations. Despite some overlap, the clinical manifestations of cohesinopathies vary considerably. Novel roles of the cohesin complex have emerged during the past decades, suggesting that important cell cycle regulators exert important biological effects through non-cohesion-related functions and broadening the potential pathomechanisms involved in cohesinopathies. This review focuses on non-cohesion-related functions of the cohesin complex, gene dosage effect, epigenetic regulation and TGF-β in cohesinopathy context, especially in comparison to hronic trial and ntestinal ysrhythmia (CAID) syndrome, a very distinct cohesinopathy caused by a homozygous Shugoshin-1 (SGO1) mutation (K23E) and characterized by pacemaker failure in both heart (sick sinus syndrome followed by atrial flutter) and gut (chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction) with no intellectual or growth delay. We discuss the possible impact of SGO1 alterations in human pathologies and the potential impact of the SGO1 K23E mutation in the sinus node and gut development and functions. We suggest that the human phenotypes observed in CdLS, CAID syndrome and other cohesinopathies can inform future studies into the less well-known non-cohesion-related functions of cohesin complex genes. : AD: Alzheimer Disease; AFF4: AF4/FMR2 Family Member 4; ANKRD11: Ankyrin Repeat Domain 11; APC: Anaphase Promoter Complex; ASD: Atrial Septal Defect; ATRX: ATRX Chromatin Remodeler; ATRX: Alpha Thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome; BIRC5: Baculoviral IAP Repeat Containing 5; BMP: Bone Morphogenetic Protein; BRD4: Bromodomain Containing 4; BUB1: BUB1 Mitotic Checkpoint Serine/Threonine Kinase; CAID: Chronic Atrial and Intestinal Dysrhythmia; CDK1: Cyclin Dependent Kinase 1; CdLS: Cornelia de Lange Syndrome; CHD: Congenital Heart Disease; CHOPS: Cognitive impairment, coarse facies, Heart defects, , Pulmonary involvement, Short stature, and skeletal dysplasia; CIPO: Chronic Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction; c-kit: KIT Proto-Oncogene Receptor  Kinase; CoATs: Cohesin Acetyltransferases; CTCF: CCCTC-Binding Factor; DDX11: DEAD/H-Box Helicase 11; ERG: Transcriptional Regulator ERG; ESCO2: Establishment of Sister Chromatid Cohesion N-Acetyltransferase 2; GJC1: Gap Junction Protein Gamma 1; H2A: Histone H2A; H3K4: Histone H3 Lysine 4; H3K9: Histone H3 Lysine 9; HCN4: Hyperpolarization Activated Cyclic Nucleotide Gated Potassium and Sodium Channel 4;p HDAC8: Histone deacetylases 8; HP1: Heterochromatin Protein 1; ICC: Interstitial Cells of Cajal; ICC-MP: Myenteric Plexus Interstitial cells of Cajal; ICC-DMP: Deep Muscular Plexus Interstitial cells of Cajal; I: Pacemaker Funny Current; IP3: Inositol trisphosphate; JNK: C-Jun N-Terminal Kinase; LDS: Loeys-Dietz Syndrome; LOAD: Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease; MAPK: Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase; MAU: MAU Sister Chromatid Cohesion Factor; MFS: Marfan Syndrome; NIPBL: NIPBL, Cohesin Loading Factor; OCT4: Octamer-Binding Protein 4; P38: P38 MAP Kinase; PDA: Patent Ductus Arteriosus; PDS5: PDS5 Cohesin Associated Factor; P-H3: Phospho Histone H3; PLK1: Polo Like Kinase 1; POPDC1: Popeye Domain Containing 1; POPDC2: Popeye Domain Containing 2; PP2A: Protein Phosphatase 2; RAD21: RAD21 Cohesin Complex Component; RBS: Roberts Syndrome; REC8: REC8 Meiotic Recombination Protein; RNAP2: RNA polymerase II; SAN: Sinoatrial node; SCN5A: Sodium Voltage-Gated Channel Alpha Subunit 5; SEC: Super Elongation Complex; SGO1: Shogoshin-1; SMAD: SMAD Family Member; SMC1A: Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes 1A; SMC3: Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes 3; SNV: Single Nucleotide Variant; SOX2: SRY-Box 2; SOX17: SRY-Box 17; SSS: Sick Sinus Syndrome; STAG2: Cohesin Subunit SA-2; TADs: Topology Associated Domains; TBX: T-box transcription factors; TGF-β: Transforming Growth Factor β; TGFBR: Transforming Growth Factor β receptor; TOF: Tetralogy of Fallot; TREK1: TREK-1 K(+) Channel Subunit; VSD: Ventricular Septal Defect; WABS: Warsaw Breakage Syndrome; WAPL: WAPL Cohesin Release Factor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014927>Gα deficiency in the dorsomedial hypothalamus leads to , hyperphagia, and reduced thermogenesis associated with impaired leptin signaling.</a></h2><p>Gα couples multiple receptors, including the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R), to intracellular cAMP generation.

Mice with brain-specific Gα deficiency also develop  with reduced energy expenditure and locomotor activity, and impaired adaptive thermogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.We created mice (DMHGsKO) with Gα deficiency limited to the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) and examined the effects on energy balance and thermogenesis.DMHGsKO mice developed severe, early-onset  associated with hyperphagia and reduced energy expenditure and locomotor activity, along with impaired brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. Studies in mice with loss of MC4R in the DMH suggest that defective DMH MC4R/Gα signaling contributes to abnormal energy balance but not to abnormal locomotor activity or cold-induced thermogenesis. Instead, DMHGsKO mice had impaired leptin signaling along with increased expression of the leptin signaling inhibitor protein  phosphatase 1B in the DMH, which likely contributes to the observed hyperphagia and reductions in energy expenditure, locomotor activity, and cold-induced thermogenesis.DMH Gα signaling is critical for energy balance, thermogenesis, and leptin signaling.

However, the direct effect of VSG on metabolic functions is not fully understood. We aimed to investigate if alterations in hypothalamic neurons were linked with perturbations in liver metabolism after VSG in an energy intake-controlled obese mouse model. C57BL/6 and hrNPY-GFP reporter mice received HFD for 12 weeks and were then divided into three groups: Sham (ad lib), sham (pair-fed) with VSG, and VSG. Food intake was measured daily, and blood glucose levels were measured before and after the study. Energy expenditure and body composition were determined. Serum parameters, liver lipid and glycogen contents were measured, and gene/protein expression were analyzed. Hypothalamic POMC, AgRP/NPY, and  hydroxylase expressing neurons were counted. As results, we found that VSG reduced body weight gain and adiposity induced by HFD, increased energy expenditure independent of energy intake. Fed and fasted blood glucose levels were reduced in the VSG group. While serum active GLP-1 level was increased, the active ghrelin and triglycerides levels were decreased along with improved insulin resistance in VSG group. Liver lipid accumulation, glycogen content, and gluconeogenic gene expression were reduced in the VSG group. In the hypothalamus, TH expressing neuron population was decreased, and the POMC-expressing neuron population was increased in the VSG group. Our data suggests that VSG improves metabolic symptoms by increasing energy expenditure and lowering lipid and glycogen contents in the liver. These physiological alterations are possibly related to changes in hypothalamic neuron populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29769704>Effect of protocatechuic acid on insulin responsiveness and inflammation in visceral adipose tissue from obese individuals: possible role for PTP1B.</a></h2><p>The occurrence of chronic inflammation in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in obese subjects precipitates the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Anthocyanins and their main metabolite protocatechuic acid (PCA) have been demonstrated to stimulate insulin signaling in human adipocytes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether PCA is able to modulate insulin responsiveness and inflammation in VAT from obese (OB) and normal weight (NW) subjects.VATs obtained from NW and OB subjects were incubated or not (control) with 100 μM PCA for 24 h. After incubation, tissues untreated and treated with PCA were acutely stimulated with insulin (20 nM, 20 min). PTP1B, p65 NF-κB, phospho-p65 NF-κB, IRS-1, IRβ, Akt, GLUT4 as well as basal and insulin-stimulated Tyr-IRS-1 and Ser-Akt phosphorylations were assessed by Western blotting in NW- and OB-VAT. Samples were assessed for PTP1B activity and adipocytokine secretion.PCA restored insulin-induced phosphorylation in OB-VAT by increasing phospho-Tyr-IRS-1 and phospho-Ser-Akt after insulin stimulation as observed in NW-VAT (p < 0.05). PTP1B activity was lower in OB-VAT treated with PCA with respect to untreated (p < 0.05). Compared to non-treated tissues, PCA reduced phospho-p65 NF-κB and IL-6 in OB-VAT, and IL-1β in NW-VAT (p < 0.05); and increased adiponectin secretion in NW-VAT (p < 0.05).PCA restores the insulin responsiveness of OB-VAT by increasing IRS-1 and Akt phosphorylation which could be related with the lower PTP1B activity found in PCA-treated OB-VAT. Furthermore, PCA diminishes inflammation in VAT.

This study examines if -associated stimuli have regulatory effects on TH levels in periodontal cells and tissues. Human periodontal ligament fibroblasts were cultured in the presence of leptin or visfatin for up to 2 days. Untreated cells served as control. TH regulation was analyzed by real-time PCR, immunocytochemistry and ELISA. TH gene expression in periodontal tissues of normal-weight and obese rodents was determined. Examination of gingival biopsies from rats and patients with and without periodontal disease was performed by real-time PCR or immunohistochemistry. For statistics, ANOVA and post hoc tests were applied (p < 0.05). In vitro, TH gene expression and protein levels were increased by leptin and visfatin. In vivo, TH gene expression was upregulated in periodontal tissues of obese rodents as compared to normal-weight animals. Additionally, increased TH gene expression was found in rat gingival biopsies with experimental periodontitis. Human gingival biopsies from sites of periodontitis confirmed the animal data by demonstrating elevated TH levels at periodontally diseased sites. This study provides original evidence that -associated stimuli induce a TH upregulation in periodontal cells and tissues. Since TH levels were also increased at periodontitis sites, our in vitro and animal findings suggest that this enzyme could represent a pathomechanism whereby  contributes to periodontitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29373583>Zinc stimulates glucose oxidation and glycemic control by modulating the insulin signaling pathway in human and mouse skeletal muscle cell lines.</a></h2><p>Zinc is a metal ion that is an essential cell signaling molecule. Highlighting this, zinc is an insulin mimetic, activating cellular pathways that regulate cellular homeostasis and physiological responses. Previous studies have linked dysfunctional zinc signaling with several disease states including cancer, , cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The present study evaluated the insulin-like effects of zinc on cell signaling molecules including , PRSA40, Akt, ERK1/2, SHP-2, GSK-3β and p38, and glucose oxidation in human and mouse skeletal muscle cells. Insulin and zinc independently led to the phosphorylation of these proteins over a 60-minute time course in both mouse and human skeletal muscle cells. Similarly, utilizing a protein array we identified that zinc could active the phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2 and GSK-3B in human and ERK1/2 and GSK-3B in mouse skeletal muscle cells. Glucose oxidation assays were performed on skeletal muscle cells treated with insulin, zinc, or a combination of both and resulted in a significant induction of glucose consumption in mouse (p<0.01) and human (p<0.05) skeletal muscle cells when treated with zinc alone. Insulin, as expected, increased glucose oxidation in mouse (p<0.001) and human (0.001) skeletal muscle cells, however the combination of zinc and insulin did not augment glucose consumption in these cells. Zinc acts as an insulin mimetic, activating key molecules implicated in cell signaling to maintain glucose homeostasis in mouse and human skeletal muscle cells. Zinc is an important metal ion implicated in several biological processes. The role of zinc as an insulin memetic in activating key signaling molecules involved in glucose homeostasis could provide opportunities to utilize this ion therapeutically in treating disorders associated with dysfunctional zinc signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310736>Breast cancer: Occluded role of mitochondria N-acetylserotonin/melatonin ratio in co-ordinating pathophysiology.</a></h2><p>A plethora of factors contribute to the biochemical underpinnings of breast cancer, in the absence of any clear, integrative framework. This article proposes that melatonergic pathway regulation within mitochondria provides an integrative framework for the wide array of data driving breast cancer pathophysiology. As melatonin is toxic to breast cancer cells, its production within mitochondria poses a significant challenge to breast cancer cell survival. Consequently, the diverse plasticity in breast cancer cells may arise from a requirement to decrease mitochondria melatonin synthesis. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor role in breast cancer pathophysiology may be mediated by an increase in cytochrome P450 (CYP)1b1 in mitochondria, leading to the backward conversion of melatonin to N-acetylserotonin (NAS). NAS has distinct effects to melatonin, including its activation of the  receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor. TrkB activation significantly contributes to breast cancer cell survival and migration. However, the most important aspect of NAS induction by CYP1b1 in breast cancer cells is the prevention of melatonin effects in mitochondria. Many of the changes occurring in breast cancer cells arise from the need to regulate this pathway in mitochondria, allowing this to provide a framework that integrates a host of previously disparate data, including: microRNAs, estrogen, 14-3-3 proteins, sirtuins, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and the kynurenine pathways. It is also proposed that this framework provides a pathoetiological model incorporating the early developmental regulation of the gut microbiome that integrates breast cancer risk factors, including .

We assessed hepatic post-translational alterations in response to treatment of cells with saturated and unsaturated free fatty acids and the consumption of a high-fat diet by mice. These data revealed widespread  phosphorylation changes affecting a large number of enzymes involved in metabolic processes as well as canonical receptor-mediated signal transduction networks. Targeting two of the most prominently affected molecular features in our data, SRC-family kinase activity and elevated reactive oxygen species, significantly abrogated the effects of saturated fat exposure in vitro and high-fat diet in vivo.

Here we provide evidence for an alternative neural communication mechanism that is relevant for food intake control involving cerebroventricular volume transmission of the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH). Results reveal that the cerebral ventricles receive input from approximately one-third of MCH-producing neurons. Moreover, MCH cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels increase prior to nocturnal feeding and following chemogenetic activation of MCH-producing neurons. Utilizing a dual viral vector approach, additional results reveal that selective activation of putative CSF-projecting MCH neurons increases food intake. In contrast, food intake was reduced following immunosequestration of MCH endogenously present in CSF, indicating that neuropeptide transmission through the cerebral ventricles is a physiologically relevant signaling pathway for energy balance control. Collectively these results suggest that neural-CSF volume transmission signaling may be a common neurobiological mechanism for the control of fundamental behaviors.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Leptin is a weight-reducing hormone produced by adipose tissue, which decreases food intake via hypothalamic leptin receptors (Ob-Rb) and the Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signaling pathway. Protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) negatively regulates leptin signaling by dephosphorylating JAK2, and the increased activity of PTP1B is implicated in the pathogenesis of . Hence, inhibition of PTP1B may help prevent and reduce . In this study, we revealed that phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a naturally occurring isothiocyanate in certain cruciferous vegetables, potently inhibits recombinant PTP1B by binding to the reactive cysteinyl thiol. Moreover, we found that PEITC causes the ligand-independent phosphorylation of Ob-Rb, JAK2, and STAT3 by inhibiting cellular PTP1B in differentiated human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells. PEITC treatment also induced nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated STAT3, resulting in enhanced anorexigenic POMC expression and suppressed orexigenic NPY/AGRP expression.
