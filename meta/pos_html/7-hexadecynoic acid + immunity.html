E2 has been shown to be involved in several functions including virus adsorption, induction of protective  and virulence in swine. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we previously identified a swine host protein, dynactin subunit 6 (DCTN6), which is a component of the cell dynactin complex, as a specific binding partner for E2. We confirmed the interaction between DCTN6 and E2 proteins in CSFV-infected swine cells by using two additional independent methodologies, co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay. E2 residues critical to mediate the protein-protein interaction with DCTN6 were mapped by a reverse yeast-two-hybrid approach using a randomly mutated E2 library. A recombinant CSFV mutant, E2ΔDCTN6v, harboring specific substitutions in those critical residues was developed to assess the importance of the E2-DCTN6 protein-protein interaction for viral replication and virulence in swine. CSFV E2ΔDCTN6v shows reduced replication than the parental virus in an established swine cell line, SK6, and in primary swine macrophage cultures. Remarkably, animals infected with CSFV E2ΔDCTN6v remained clinically normal during the 21-day observational period sugesting that the ability of CSFV E2 to bind host DCTN6 protein efficiently during the infection may play a role in virus virulence. Structural glycoprotein E2 is an important component of CSFV due to the involvement in many virus activities, particularly virus-host interactions. Herein is the description and characterization of the protein-protein interaction between E2 and swine host protein DCTN6 during virus infection. The E2 amino  residues mediating the interaction with DCTN6 were also identified. A recombinant CSFV was created harboring mutations disrupting E2-DCTN6 interaction. The effect of disrupting the E2-DCTN6 protein-protein interaction was studied using reverse genetics. It is shown that the same amino  substitutions abrogating E2-DCTN6 interaction in vitro constitute a critical factor in virus virulence in the natural host, domestic swine. This highlights the potential importance of the E2-DCTN6 protein-protein interaction in CSFV virulence and provides possible mechanisms of virus attenuation for the development of improved CSF vaccines.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604803>Why glycosylation matters in building a better flu vaccine.</a></h2><p>Low vaccine efficacy against seasonal influenza A virus (IAV) stems from the ability of the virus to evade existing  while maintaining fitness. While most potent neutralizing antibodies bind antigenic sites on the globular head domain of the IAV envelope glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA), the error-prone IAV polymerase enables rapid evolution of key antigenic sites, resulting in immune escape.  Significantly, the appearance of new N-glycosylation consensus sequences (sequons, NXT/NXS, rarely NXC) on the HA globular domain occurs among the more prevalent mutations as an IAV strain undergoes antigenic drift. The appearance of new glycosylation shields underlying amino  residues from antibody contact, tunes receptor specificity, and balances receptor avidity with virion escape, all of which help maintain viral propagation through seasonal mutations. The World Health Organization selects seasonal vaccine strains based on information from surveillance, laboratory, and clinical observations. While the genetic sequences are known, mature glycosylated structures of circulating strains are not defined.  In this review, we summarize mass spectrometric methods for quantifying site-specific glycosylation in IAV strains, and compare the evolution of IAV glycosylation to that of human immunodeficiency virus.  We argue that the determination of site-specific glycosylation of IAV glycoproteins would enable development of vaccines that take advantage of glycosylation-dependent mechanisms whereby virus glycoproteins are processed by antigen presenting cells.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635360>Effect of Age and Weaning on Growth Performance, Rumen Fermentation, and Serum Parameters in Lambs Fed Starter with Limited Ewe-Lamb Interaction.</a></h2><p>Sixty neonatal Hu lambs were weaned at either 21 (n = 30) (early weaning, EW) or 49 days (n = 30) of age (control, CON). The starter intake and body weight (BW) of lambs was recorded weekly from birth to 63 days of age. Diarrhea rate of lambs was measured from birth to 35 days. Six randomly selected lambs from each treatment were slaughtered at 26, 35, and 63 days of age, respectively. Ruminal pH, NH-N, and volatile fatty  (VFA) concentration, as well as serum parameters including , antioxidant status, and inflammatory parameters from randomly selected lambs from each treatment were measured. There was no difference in BW at birth and day 21 between the two groups of lambs ( > 0.05). However, BW of the lambs in the EW group was significantly lower than those in the CON group ( < 0.01) from 28 to 49 days of age. Average daily gain (ADG) of the lambs in the EW group was significantly lower than those in the CON group ( < 0.01) at three weeks after early weaning. Starter intake of the lambs in the EW group was obviously higher than that in the CON group ( < 0.01) from day 28 to 49. In addition, the diarrhea rate was significantly higher than that in the CON group from day 5 to 14 after weaning ( < 0.01). The EW group had heavier carcasses ( < 0.01) and rumen relative to whole stomach weights ( < 0.01). Rumen pH was increased by age ( < 0.01) and was not affected by early weaning ( > 0.05). Early weaning decreased abomasum relative to whole stomach weight ( < 0.01) and increased total VFA concentrations ( < 0.01) at day 26. There was no difference in lambs'  and stress indicators ( > 0.05). The results indicated that lambs weaned at 21 days of age had decreased ADG and higher diarrhea rate, although the overall  was not compromised. Long-term study is needed to further validate the feasibility of early weaning strategy in lambs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534039>Hepatitis C virus infection is inhibited by a non-canonical antiviral signaling pathway targeted by NS3-NS4A.</a></h2><p>The hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3-NS4A protease complex is required for viral replication and is the major viral innate immune evasion factor. NS3-NS4A evades antiviral innate  by inactivating several proteins, including MAVS, the signaling adaptor for RIG-I and MDA5, and Riplet, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that activates RIG-I. Here, we identified a Tyr-16-Phe (Y16F) change in the NS4A transmembrane domain that prevents NS3-NS4A targeting of Riplet but not MAVS. This Y16F substitution reduces HCV replication in Huh7 cells, but not in Huh-7.5 cells, known to lack RIG-I signaling. Surprisingly, deletion of RIG-I in Huh7 cells did not restore Y16F viral replication. Rather, we found that Huh-7.5 cells lack Riplet expression and that addition of Riplet to these cells reduced HCV Y16F replication, while addition of Riplet lacking the RING domain restored HCV Y16F replication. In addition, TBK1 inhibition or IRF3 deletion in Huh7 cells was sufficient to restore HCV Y16F replication, and the Y16F protease lacked the ability to prevent IRF3 activation or interferon induction. Taken together, these data reveal that the NS4A Y16 residue regulates a non-canonical Riplet-TBK1-IRF3-dependent, but RIG-I-MAVS-independent, signaling pathway that limits HCV infection. The HCV NS3-NS4A protease complex facilitates viral replication by cleaving and inactivating the antiviral innate immune signaling proteins MAVS and Riplet, which are essential for RIG-I activation. NS3-NS4A therefore prevents IRF3 activation and interferon induction during HCV infection. Here, we uncover an amino  residue within the NS4A transmembrane domain that is essential for inactivation of Riplet, but does not affect MAVS cleavage by NS3-NS4A. Our study reveals that Riplet is involved in a RIG-I- and MAVS-independent signaling pathway that activates IRF3 and that this pathway is normally inactivated by NS3-NS4A during HCV infection. Our study selectively uncouples these distinct regulatory mechanisms within NS3-NS4A and defines a new role for Riplet in the antiviral response to HCV. As Riplet is known to be inhibited by other RNA viruses, such as such influenza A virus, this innate immune signaling pathway may also be important in controlling other RNA virus infections.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678710>First visualization of circulating neutrophil extracellular traps using cell fluorescence during human septic shock-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation.</a></h2><p>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a severe complication of septic shock. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) may play a key role in septic shock-induced DIC via the release of neutrophils extracellular traps (NETs). NETs capture invading pathogens, but also act as a pro-coagulant surface at the interface between  and thrombosis. During septic shock-induced DIC, neutrophil activation may result in excessive NET formation. Herein, we originally report the presence of circulating NETs in human blood during septic shock-induced DIC. To investigate NET formation during shock-induced DIC neutrophils were isolated from patients in septic shock associated with (n = 3) or without (n = 3) DIC. Neutrophils from healthy donors (n = 3) were stimulated in vitro with ionomycin as NET formation positive controls. PMNs smears were stained with mouse anti-human FITC anti-myeloperoxidase antibody and the blue-fluorescent DAPI nucleic  stain. NETs were identified as elongated extracellular DNA fibers associated to myeloperoxidase detected by immunofluorescence. NETs were unambiguously observed in PMNs from septic shock patients with DIC but not from patients without DIC. NETs features in DIC+ patients were undistinguishable from those observed in ionomycin-induced PMNs from healthy donors. Fluorescence images of NETs were associated to extracellular cytoplasmic expansions. Our data report for the first time the direct visualization of circulating NETs in patients with septic shock-induced DIC. The in vivo relevance of previously reported indirect markers of NETosis (neutrophil side fluorescence) is confirmed.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Yet, the fate of highly invasive fouling species in a rapidly acidifying ocean remains poorly understood, due to lack of information on multigenerational consequences at different levels of biological organization. Here, we investigated antioxidant responses of the mussel, Musculista senhousia, a swiftly spreading invasive fouling species in global coastal waters, following transgenerational exposure to elevated pCO. In the face of seawater acidification, M. senhousia without a prior history of transgenerational exposure to elevated pCO showed resistance to lipid peroxidation, but significantly increased activities of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), indicated oxidative stress responses. However, enhanced transgenerational  occurred, as exemplified by observations that mussels originating from parents exposed to elevated pCO exhibited significantly lower activities of SOD, CAT and GPx in comparison to those spawn from parents exposed to ambient pCO. Rapid transgenerational acclimation of M. senhousia in terms of reduced oxidative stress responses can likely be linked to the enhanced capacity of maintaining -base homeostasis previously demonstrated. These findings provide the first evidence of transgenerational plasticity at the biochemical level in highly invasive fouling bivalve species, and represent a step forward in understanding how they respond and acclimate in an acidifying ocean.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the underlying mechanisms are not completely clear. MCPIP1 is an endoribonuclease and an important regulator in both innate and adaptive  by targeting inflammatory mRNA degradation. Here we report that MCPIP1 RNase can also selectively detect and degrade the mRNAs encoded by transfected plasmids. In transient transfection, MCPIP1 expression potently degraded the mRNA from exogenously transfected vectors, which is independent on the vector, genes and cell types used. Conversely, the expression of transfected plasmids in MCPIP1-null cells is significantly higher than that in wild-type cells. Interestingly, overexpression of MCPIP1 or MCPIP1 deficiency does not affect the expression of the exogenous genes incorporated into the host genome in a stable cell line or the global gene expression of host genome. This ability is not associated with PKR/RNase L system, as PKR inhibitors does not block MCPIP1-mediated mRNA degradation of exogenously transfected genes. Lastly, expression of MCPIP1 suppressed replication of Zika virus in infected cells. The study may provide a model for understanding the antiviral mechanisms of MCPIP1, and a putative tool to increase the expression of transfected exogenous genes.© 2019 The Author(s).

Therefore, new therapeutic interventions are needed to increase the immunogenicity of tumors and overcome the resistance to these immunotherapies. Oncolytic properties of common viruses can be exploited for the priming of antitumor , and such oncolytic viruses are currently in active clinical development in combination with immune checkpoint-targeted therapies. However, the routine implementation of these therapies is limited by their manufacturing constraints, the risk of exposure of clinical staff, and the ongoing regulations on genetically modified organisms. We sought to determine whether anti-infectious disease vaccines could be used as a commercially available source of immunostimulatory agents for cancer immunotherapy. We found that rotavirus vaccines have both immunostimulatory and oncolytic properties. In vitro, they can directly kill cancer cells with features of immunogenic cell death. In vivo, intratumoral rotavirus therapy has antitumor effects that are dependent on the immune system. In several immunocompetent murine tumor models, intratumoral rotavirus overcomes resistance to and synergizes with immune checkpoint-targeted therapy. Heat- and UV-inactivated rotavirus lost their oncolytic activity but kept their synergy with immune checkpoint-targeted antibodies through the up-regulation of the double-stranded RNA receptor retinoic -induced gene 1 (RIG-I). Rotavirus vaccines are clinical-grade products used in pediatric and adult populations. Therefore, in situ immunization strategies with intratumoral-attenuated rotavirus could be implemented quickly in the clinic.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The update further provides a new database infrastructure featuring two additional analysis modes that facilitate database querying and real-world data analysis. The increased yield of TCR specificity identification methods and the overall increase in the number of studies in the field has allowed us to expand the database more than 5-fold. Furthermore, several new analysis methods are included. For example, batch annotation of TCR repertoire sequencing samples allows for annotating large datasets on-line. Using recently developed bioinformatic methods for TCR motif mining, we have built a reduced set of high-quality TCR motifs that can be used for both training TCR specificity predictors and matching against TCRs of interest.

They play three major roles: energy metabolism, structural, and signaling. They are dynamic molecules strongly influenced by endogenous and exogenous factors including genetics, diet, age, lifestyle, drugs, disease and inflammation. As precision medicine starts to become mainstream, there is a huge burgeoning interest in lipids and their potential to act as unique biomarkers or prognostic indicators. Lipids comprise a large component of all metabolites (around one-third), and our expanding knowledge about their dynamic behavior is fueling the hope that mapping their regulatory biochemical pathways on a systems level will revolutionize our ability to prevent, diagnose, and stratify major human diseases. Up to now, clinical lipid measurements have consisted primarily of total cholesterol or triglycerides, as a measure for cardiovascular risk and response to lipid lowering drugs. Nowadays, we are able to measure thousands of individual lipids that make up the lipidome. nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR) metabolomics is also being increasingly used in large cohort studies where it can report on total levels of selected lipid classes, and relative levels of fatty  saturation. To support the application of lipidomics research, LIPID MAPS was established in 2003, and since then has gone on to become the go-to resource for several lipid databases, lipid drawing tools, data deposition, and more recently lipidomics informatics tools, and a lipid biochemistry encyclopedia, LipidWeb. Alongside this, the recently established Lipidomics Standards Initiative plays a key role in standardization of lipidomics methodologies.

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a key signaling component that controls stress reactions and growth at different stages of plant development, and the PP2A regulatory subunit PP2A-B'γ is required for negative regulation of pathogenesis responses and for maintenance of cell homeostasis in short day conditions. Here, we report molecular mechanisms by which PP2A-B'γ regulates Botrytis cinerea resistance and leaf senescence in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We extend the molecular functionality of PP2A-B'γ to a protein kinase-phosphatase interaction with the defense-associated calcium-dependent protein kinase CPK1 and present indications this interaction may function to control CPK1 activity. In pre-senescent leaf tissues, PP2A-B'γ is also required to negatively control the expression of salicylic -related defense genes, which have recently proven vital in plant resistance to necrotrophic fungal pathogens. In addition, we find the premature leaf yellowing of pp2a-b'γ depends on salicylic  biosynthesis via SALICYLIC  INDUCTION DEFICIENT2 and bears the hallmarks of developmental leaf senescence. We propose PP2A-B'γ age-dependently controls salicylic -related signaling in plant  and developmental leaf senescence.{copyright, serif} 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

They play key roles in mediating the translocation of capsids from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by facilitating the budding of capsids into the perinuclear space (PNS). NEC of alphaherpesvirus can induce the formation of virion-like vesicles from the nuclear membrane in the absence of other viral proteins. However, whether NEC of gammaherpesvirus harbor the ability to do so in mammalian cells remained to be determined. In this study, we first constructed ORF67-null and ORF69-null mutants of murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) and demonstrated that both ORF67 and ORF69 played critical roles in the nuclear egress and hence viral lytic replication. Biochemical and bioimaging analyses showed that ORF67 and ORF69 interacted with each other and were sufficient to induce virion-like vesicles from the nuclear membrane in mammalian cells. Thus, we designated ORF67 and ORF69 as components of MHV-68 NEC. Furthermore, we identified amino  critical for mediating the interaction between ORF67 and ORF69 through homology modeling and verified their function in the nuclear egress, providing insights into the molecular basis of NEC formation in gammaherpesviruses. Increasing amounts of knowledge indicated that nuclear egress complex (NEC) are critical for the nuclear egress of herpesvirus capsids, which can be viewed as a vesicle-mediated transport pathway through the nuclear membrane. In this study, we identified ORF67 and ORF69 as components of NEC in murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68), and demonstrated that they induced virion-like vesicles from the nuclear membrane in mammalian cells efficiently. This is the first time that NEC of a gammaherpesvirus have been found to demonstrate such an essential characteristic. In addition, we identified amino  critical for mediating the interaction between ORF67 and ORF69 as well as the nuclear egress. Notably, these amino  are conserved in Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), providing a structural basis to design anti-gammaherpesviruses drugs.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536767>Molecular characterization of carboxypeptidase B-like (CPB) in Scylla paramamosain and its role in white spot syndrome virus and Vibrio alginolyticus infection.</a></h2><p>Carboxypeptidase plays an important physiological role in the tissues and organs of animals. In this study, we cloned an entire 2316 bp carboxypeptidase B-like (CPB) sequence with a 1302 bp open reading frame encoding a 434 amino  peptide from Scylla paramamosain. The CPB gene was expressed highly in hepatopancreas and decreased in crab hemocytes after challenges with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) or Vibrio alginolyticus. After CPB gene knockdown using double-stranded RNA (CPB-dsRNA), the expression of JAK, STAT, C-type lectin, crustin antimicrobial peptide, Toll-like receptors, prophenoloxidase, and myosin II essential light chain-like protein were down-regulated in hemocytes at 24 h post dsRNA treatment. CPB knockdown decreases total hemocyte count in crabs indicated that CPB may negatively regulate crab hemocyte proliferation in crabs. CPB showed an inhibitory effect on hemocyte apoptosis in crabs infected with WSSV or V. alginolyticus. The phagocytosis rate of WSSV by hemocytes was increased after CPB-dsRNA treatment. After WSSV challenge, the mortality and WSSV copy number were both decreased but the rate of hemocyte apoptosis was increased in CPB-dsRNA-treated crabs. The results indicate that the antiviral activity of the crabs was enhanced when CPB was knocked down, indicating WSSV may take advantage of CPB to benefit its replication. In contrast, the absence of CPB in crabs increased mortality following the V. alginolyticus challenge. The phagocytosis rate of V. alginolyticus by hemocytes was increased after CPB-dsRNA treatment. It was revealed that CPB may play a positive role in the immune response to V. alginolyticus through increasing the phagocytosis rate of V. alginolyticus. This research further adds to our understanding of the CPB and identifies its potential role in the innate  of crabs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

They pose a worldwide threat to food security as well as human health. Fungal infections are increasing now day by day worldwide, and the current antimycotic drugs are not effective due to the emergence of resistant strains. Therefore, it is an urgent need for the finding of new plant-origin antifungal peptides (PhytoAFPs). Huge numbers of peptides were extracted from different plant species which play a protective role against fungal infection. Hundreds of plant-origin peptides with antifungal activity have already been reported. So there is a requirement of a dedicated platform which systematically catalogs plant-origin peptides along with their antifungal properties. PlantAFP database is a resource of experimentally verified plant-origin antifungal peptides, collected from research articles, patents, and public databases. The current release of PlantAFP database contains 2585 peptide entries among which 510 are unique peptides. Each entry provides comprehensive information of a peptide that includes its peptide sequence, peptide name, peptide class, length of the peptide, molecular mass, antifungal activity, and origin of peptides. Besides this primary information, PlantAFP stores peptide sequences in SMILES format.

Long-term ammonia stress could affect the normal growth, and also increase the risk for the occurrence of various diseases. In order to learn the mechanism that ammonia caused the outbreak of the shrimp disease, transcriptomics and metabolomics approaches were used to analyze the differential expressions of the genes in hemocytes and different metabolites in the serum of the Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei under ammonia exposure. Transcriptional analysis showed that 17 cell apoptosis related genes, seven phagocytosis related genes, 10  related genes and seven cell cycle and lipid metabolism related genes showed differential expressions after ammonia exposure. Metabolomics analysis on the serum showed that 25 differential metabolites were identified in positive and negative ion patterns. They are involved in purine metabolism, amino  metabolism and lipid metabolism. Injection of two up-regulated metabolites triethanolamine and oxypurinol to normal shrimp could induce apoptosis in normal shrimp. The total hemocytes counts in shrimp showed a significant decrease and the apoptotic cell ratio increased significantly under ammonia exposure. These results suggested that ammonia exposure increased the apoptosis of hemocytes, which affected the  of shrimp, and thus caused susceptibility to pathogenic infection. These data will help us understand the mechanism of ammonia stress leading to the  decline of shrimp.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

These reactions are triggered by the calcium-binding muscle protein β-parvalbumin, which was shown to have reduced immunoglobulin E (IgE)-binding capacity upon calcium depletion. This work aimed to reduce gilthead seabream allergenicity using diets supplemented with a calcium chelator. Three experimental feeds were tested, differing in ethylenediaminetetraacetic  (EDTA) supplementation, and its effects on muscle and parvalbumin's IgE-reactivity were analyzed. Chromatographic determination of EDTA showed no accumulation in the muscle and sensory results demonstrated that the lowest concentration did not affect fish quality as edible fish. Proteomics revealed one protein related to muscle contraction with significantly different relative abundance. Immunoblot assays performed with fish-allergic patients sera indicated a 50% reduction in IgE-reactivity upon EDTA presence. These preliminary results provide the basis for the further development of a non-GMO approach to modulate fish allergenicity and improve safety of aquaculture fish.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The BSSL gene is highly polymorphic with a variant number of O-linked glycosylated 11 amino  repeats at the C-terminus of the protein, encoded in exon 11 of the gene. It has been shown that certain BSSL genotypes associate with decreased HIV-1 transmission in vitro and decreased HIV-1 disease progression. The protein forms dimers and individuals possessing one high (typically 14-21) and one low (typically 7-11) number of repeat domains has been shown to have stronger binding of BSSL to DC-SIGN and HIV-1 inhibitory activity in vitro. Since we previously demonstrated that SNPs within the DC-SIGN gene can associate with risk of HCV sexual transmission and which can be linked to diminished DC-SIGN gene expression we aimed to identify whether BSSL polymorphisms associated similarly through differential binding to DC-SIGN. DNA was isolated from the HIV-1 infected MSM cohort (MOSAIC) composed of HCV multiple exposed uninfected (MEU) (N = 30) and multiple exposed HCV infected (MEI) (N = 32) individuals and from the Amsterdam cohort studies (ACS) intravenous drug using (IDU) cohort (22 MEI and 40 MEU). The numbers of repeats in exon 11 were determined by PCR with repeat distributions compared between MEI and MEU. No statistical significant difference in the copy number of exon 11 repeats, or combinations of, in the BSSL gene was observed when comparing HCV infected MEI with MEU, thus the exon 11 repeat copy number in the BSSL gene does not affect HCV susceptibility.Crown Copyright © 2019.

Here, we clearly demonstrated that zebrafish ATP5A1 was a newly characterized lipoteichoic  (LTA)- and LPS-binding protein abundantly stored in the eggs and embryos of zebrafish. Zebrafish ATP5A1 acted not only as a pattern recognition receptor, capable of identifying LTA and LPS, but also as an effector molecule, capable of inhibiting the growth of both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. ATP5A1 could disrupt the bacterial membranes by a combined action of membrane depolarization and permeabilization. We also found that the N-terminal 65 residues were critical for the antibacterial activity of zebrafish ATP5A1. In particular, we showed that microinjection of exogenous recombinant (r)ATP5A1 into early embryos could promote their resistance against pathogenic  challenge, and this pathogen-resistant activity was markedly reduced by the coinjection of anti-ATP5A1 antibody or by the knockdown with morpholino for  but not by the coinjection of anti-actin antibody. Moreover, each egg/embryo contains a sufficient amount of ATP5A1  to kill . Furthermore, the N-terminal 65 residues 1-65 of ATP5A1 α subunit (rA) with  antibacterial activity also promoted the resistance of embryos against , but the N-terminal 69 residues 66-134 (rA) or C-terminal residues 135-551 (rA) of ATP5A1 α subunit without  antibacterial activity did not. Finally, we showed that the antibacterial activity of the N-terminal 65 residues of ATP5A1 α subunit was conserved throughout animal evolution. Collectively, these results indicate that ATP5A1 is a novel maternal immunocompetent factor that can protect the early embryos of zebrafish from bacterial infection.

CD1d can also bind non-activating lipids, such as sphingomyelin. We hypothesized that these serve as endogenous regulators and investigated humans and mice deficient in  sphingomyelinase (ASM), an enzyme that degrades sphingomyelin. We show that ASM absence in mice leads to diminished CD1d-restricted antigen presentation and iNKT cell selection in the thymus, resulting in decreased iNKT cell levels and resistance to iNKT cell-mediated inflammatory conditions.

Pharmacological ASM administration facilitates antigen presentation and restores the levels of iNKT cells in ASM-deficient mice.

It is known that differential expression of thousands of lncRNAs occurs in host during influenza A virus (IAV) infection. However, only few of them have been well characterized. Here, we identified a lncRNA, named as interferon (IFN)-stimulated lncRNA (ISR), which can be significantly upregulated in response to IAV infection in a mouse model. A sequence alignment revealed that lncRNA ISR is present in mice and human beings, and indeed, we found that it was expressed in several human and mouse cell lines and tissues. Silencing lncRNA ISR in A549 cells resulted in a significant increase in IAV replication, whereas ectopic expression of lncRNA ISR reduced the viral replication. Interestingly, interferon-β (IFN-β) treatment was able to induce lncRNA ISR expression, and induction of lncRNA ISR by viral infection was nearly abolished in host deficient of IFNAR1, a type I IFN receptor. Furthermore, the level of IAV-induced lncRNA ISR expression was decreased either in retinoic -inducible gene I () knockout A549 cells and mice or by nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) inhibitor treatment. Together, these data elucidate that lncRNA ISR is regulated by -dependent signaling that governs IFN-β production during IAV infection, and has an inhibitory capacity in viral replication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521782>A new crustin is involved in the innate immune response of shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei.</a></h2><p>Crustin is an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that plays a key role in the innate  of crustaceans. This study cloned a new crustin from Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei, which we designated as LvCrustinB, using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length cDNA of LvCrustinB is 751 bp with an open reading frame (ORF) of 591 bp encoding a peptide of 196 amino  that includes a putative signal sequence. LvCrustinB is a type II crustin that has a glycine-rich region and a single whey acidic protein domain (WAP) domain. The mRNA transcript of LvCrustinB was detected in all examined tissues and was found to be most abundantly expressed in the epithelium and muscle. The expression of LvCrustinB in hemocytes was significantly upregulated after L. vannamei was challenged with LPS, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). When LvCrustinB was knocked down with RNAi, the mortality rate of L. vannamei significantly increased after V. parahaemolyticus or WSSV infection. Recombinant LvCrustinB was produced using Pichia pastoris GS115 and was shown to bind to 2 g-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and 2 g-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and V. parahaemolyticus) via polysaccharides, which included PGN, LTA, and LPS. In vivo, the recombinant LvCrustinB remarkably protected L. vannamei from V. parahaemolyticus infection. These results suggest that LvCrustinB plays an important role in innate  and may be potentially utilized as antibacterial agents in shrimp.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Tuberculosis, a leading infectious disease killer caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), is basically the product of the interaction between bacterial virulence and host resistance. However, the effects of HDACi in host  against M.tb is largely unknown. In this study, we found that HDACi including Trichostatin A (TSA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic  (SAHA) significantly impaired phagocytosis and killing activity of macrophage. In line with these findings, we noted that M.tb induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and autophagy are significantly suppressed by TSA. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the suppression of autophagy by TSA might due to its inhibiting autophagy-regulating genes such as CACNA2D3, which regulates intracellular Ca levels. Finally, we confirmed that HDACi including TSA and SAHA significantly exacerbated the histopathological damage and M.tb load in the lung of M.tb infected mice. Taken together, our results indicated that HDACi at least TSA and SAHA significantly impaired macrophage  against M.tb and therefore increase susceptibility to TB, our findings raised the concern that the potential side effects of HDACi on latent TB reactivation should be considered in clinic.Copyright © 2019.

The accurate interpretation of AIRR-seq data depends on the existence of comprehensive germline gene reference sets. Current sets are known to be incomplete and unrepresentative of the degree of polymorphism and diversity in human and animal populations. A key issue is the complexity of the genomic regions in which they lie, which, because of the presence of multiple repeats, insertions and deletions, have not proved tractable with short-read whole genome sequencing. Recently, tools and methods for inferring such gene sequences from AIRR-seq datasets have become available, and a community approach has been developed for the expert review and publication of such inferences.

Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a downstream effector of inflammasomes, which are supramolecular complexes that activate inflammatory caspases (-1, -4, and -5 in human and -1 and -11 in mouse). GSDMD contains a functionally important N-terminal domain (GSDMD-N), a C-terminal domain, and a linker in between that is recognized and cleaved by the activated inflammatory caspases. Upon cleavage, the GSDMD-N fragments translocate on the membrane and oligomerize to form membrane-embedded pores after specifically binding to acidic lipids such as phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), phosphatidic  (PA), phosphatidylserine (PS), and cardiolipin. The pore exhibits strong membrane-disrupting cytotoxicity in mammalian cells by disrupting the osmotic potential and also serves as a gate for extracellular release of mature IL-1β and IL-18 during pyroptosis. In this chapter, we review our current understanding of GSDM proteins in physiological and pathological cell death, with more focused discussions on its structural basis for GSDM activation and pore formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31522671>RNA Editing by ADAR Adenosine Deaminases: From Molecular Plasticity of Neural Proteins to the Mechanisms of Human Cancer.</a></h2><p>RNA editing by adenosine deaminases of the ADAR family attracts a growing interest of researchers, both zoologists studying ecological and evolutionary plasticity of invertebrates and medical biochemists focusing on the mechanisms of cancer and other human diseases. These enzymes deaminate adenosine residues in the double-stranded (ds) regions of RNA with the formation of inosine. As a result, some RNAs change their three-dimensional structure and functions. Adenosine-to-inosine editing in the mRNA coding sequences may cause amino  substitutions in the encoded proteins. Here, we reviewed current concepts on the functions of two active ADAR isoforms identified in mammals (including humans). The ADAR1 protein, which acts non-specifically on extended dsRNA regions, is capable of immunosuppression via inactivation of the dsRNA interactions with specific sensors inducing the cell . Expression of a specific ADAR1 splicing variant is regulated by the type I interferons by the negative feedback mechanism. It was shown that immunosuppressing effects of ADAR1 facilitate progression of some types of cancer. On the other hand, changes in the amino  sequences resulting from the mRNA editing by the ADAR enzymes can result in the formation of neoantigens that can activate the antitumor . The ADAR2 isoform acts on RNA more selectively; its function is associated with the editing of mRNA coding regions and can lead to the amino  substitutions, in particular, those essential for the proper functioning of some neurotransmitter receptors in the central nervous system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574345>Oxidative stress mediates ethanol-induced skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction and dysregulated protein synthesis and autophagy.</a></h2><p>Protein synthesis and autophagy are regulated by cellular ATP content. We tested the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction, including generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), contributes to impaired protein synthesis and increased proteolysis resulting in tissue atrophy in a comprehensive array of models. In myotubes treated with ethanol, using unbiased approaches, we identified defects in mitochondrial electron transport chain components, endogenous antioxidants, and enzymes regulating the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle. Using high sensitivity respirometry, we observed impaired cellular respiration, decreased function of complexes I, II, and IV, and a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation in ethanol-treated myotubes and muscle from ethanol-fed mice. These perturbations resulted in lower skeletal muscle ATP content and redox ratio (NAD/NADH). Ethanol also caused a leak of electrons, primarily from complex III, with generation of mitochondrial ROS and reverse electron transport. Oxidant stress with lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric  reactive substances) and protein oxidation (carbonylated proteins) were increased in myotubes and skeletal muscle from mice and humans with alcoholic liver disease. Ethanol also impaired succinate oxidation in the TCA cycle with decreased metabolic intermediates. MitoTEMPO, a mitochondrial specific antioxidant, reversed ethanol-induced mitochondrial perturbations (including reduced oxygen consumption, generation of ROS and oxidative stress), increased TCA cycle intermediates, and reversed impaired protein synthesis and the sarcopenic phenotype. We show that ethanol causes skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased protein synthesis, and increased autophagy, and that these perturbations are reversed by targeting mitochondrial ROS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Certain amino- substitutions confer resistance to NS5A inhibitors, termed resistance-associated substitutions (RAS). If present at baseline, they can reduce virological response rates. Population-based sequencing (PBS) is generally used for baseline sequencing, however next generation sequencing (NGS) reduces the threshold for detection of sequences encoding RAS from 20% to 5%. We determined the prevalence of NS5A RAS at baseline amongst Australian chronically infected with genotype (GT)1a, GT1b and GT3 HCV, using both PBS and NGS.Samples from DAA-naïve individuals were received at the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory between June 2016 and December 2018. All samples were analysed for NS5A RAS using PBS. A subset of GT1 HCV samples were processed using NGS technology (Vela Diagnostics, Singapore) to determine the improvement in sensitivity.In total, 672 samples were analysed using PBS. The baseline prevalence of NS5A RAS was 7.6% for GT1a (n = 25/329), 15.7% for GT1b (n = 8/51) and 15.1% for GT3 (n = 44/292). NGS only marginally increased sensitivity for NS5A RAS at baseline in GT1a (16% vs 17%) and GT1b (29% vs 36%).The prevalence of NS5A RAS in GT1a HCV in Australia was low compared with international data, and was similar to other reported international prevalence for GT1b and GT3 infection.

The function of LPAP is still unknown. Studies of the LPAP interactome may reveal new details of how C45 and lymphocyte signaling in general are regulated. LPAP binding partners were sought using coimmunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry, stabilization of protein complexes with chemical crosslinkers, and Blue Native electrophoresis. In addition to CD45, several proteins were identified as LPAP partners, including CD71, CD98, cytoskeletal proteins, the amino  transporter SLC1A4, and the cell signaling component HS1. It was confirmed that more than 70% of LPAP molecules were bound with CD45 in a 1 : 1 complex. The effect of CD45 on LPAP was studied in CEM and Jurkat cells with a CD45 knockout. The LPAP levels in the cells were 10% of the level in wild-type cells. In the absence of CD45, LPAP phosphorylation at Ser-153 and Ser-163 was not affected, whereas phosphorylation at Ser-99 and Ser-172 decreased significantly.

Downy mildew caused by the oomycete Plasmopara viticola is the major pathogen in viticulture worldwide and responsible for up to 60% of pesticide treatments. Alternatives to reduce fungicides are thus utterly needed to ensure sustainable vineyard-ecosystems, consumer health and public acceptance. Essential oils (EOs) are amongst the most promising natural plant protection alternatives and have shown their antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal properties on several agricultural crops. However, the efficiency of EOs highly depends on timing, application method and the molecular interactions between the host, the pathogen and EO. Despite proven EO efficiency, the underlying processes are still not understood and remain a black box. The objectives of the present study were: a) to evaluate whether a continuous fumigation of a particular EO can control downy mildew in order to circumvent the drawbacks of direct application, b) to decipher molecular mechanisms that could be triggered in the host and the pathogen by EO application and c) to try to differentiate whether essential oils directly repress the oomycete or act as plant resistance primers. To achieve this a custom-made climatic chamber was constructed that enabled a continuous fumigation of potted vines with different EOs during long-term experiments. The grapevine (Vitis vinifera) cv Chasselas was chosen in reason of its high susceptibility to Plasmopara viticola. Grapevine cuttings were infected with P. viticola and subsequently exposed to continuous fumigation of different EOs at different concentrations, during 2 application time spans (24 hours and 10 days). Experiments were stopped when infection symptoms were clearly observed on the leaves of the control plants. Plant physiology (photosynthesis and growth rate parameters) were recorded and leaves were sampled at different time points for subsequent RNA extraction and transcriptomics analysis. Strikingly, the Oregano vulgare EO vapour treatment during 24h post-infection proved to be sufficient to reduce downy mildew development by 95%. Total RNA was extracted from leaves of 24h and 10d treatments and used for whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq). Sequenced reads were then mapped onto the V. vinifera and P. viticola genomes. Less than 1% of reads could be mapped onto the P. viticola genome from treated samples, whereas up to 30% reads from the controls mapped onto the P. viticola genome, thereby confirming the visual observation of P. viticola absence in the treated plants. On average, 80% of reads could be mapped onto the V. vinifera genome for differential expression analysis, which yielded 4800 modulated genes. Transcriptomic data clearly showed that the treatment triggered the plant's innate immune system with genes involved in salicylic, jasmonic  and ethylene synthesis and signaling, activating Pathogenesis-Related-proteins as well as phytoalexin synthesis. These results elucidate EO-host-pathogen interactions for the first time and indicate that the antifungal efficiency of EO is mainly due to the triggering of resistance pathways inside the host plants. This is of major importance for the production and research on biopesticides, plant stimulation products and for resistance-breeding strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681953>Mabellini: a genome-wide database for understanding the structural proteome and evaluating prospective antimicrobial targets of the emerging pathogen Mycobacterium abscessus.</a></h2><p>Mycobacterium abscessus, a rapid growing, multidrug resistant, nontuberculous mycobacteria, can cause a wide range of opportunistic infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. M. abscessus has emerged as a growing threat to patients with cystic fibrosis, where it causes accelerated inflammatory lung damage, is difficult and sometimes impossible to treat and can prevent safe transplantation. There is therefore an urgent unmet need to develop new therapeutic strategies. The elucidation of the M. abscessus genome in 2009 opened a wide range of research possibilities in the field of drug discovery that can be more effectively exploited upon the characterization of the structural proteome. Where there are no experimental structures, we have used the available amino  sequences to create 3D models of the majority of the remaining proteins that constitute the M. abscessus proteome (3394 proteins and over 13 000 models) using a range of up-to-date computational tools, many developed by our own group. The models are freely available for download in an on-line database, together with quality data and functional annotation. Furthermore, we have developed an intuitive and user-friendly web interface (http://www.mabellinidb.science) that enables easy browsing, querying and retrieval of the proteins of interest. We believe that this resource will be of use in evaluating the prospective targets for design of antimicrobial agents and will serve as a cornerstone to support the development of new molecules to treat M. abscessus infections.© The Author(s) 2019.

Mycobacteria possess a wide range of regulatory proteins, including the protein kinase B (PknB) which controls peptidoglycan biosynthesis during growth. Here, we observed that depletion of PknB resulted in specific transcriptional changes that are likely caused by reduced phosphorylation of the H-NS-like regulator Lsr2 at threonine 112. The activity of PknB towards this phosphosite was confirmed with purified proteins, and this site was required for adaptation of Mtb to hypoxic conditions, and growth on solid media. Like H-NS, Lsr2 binds DNA in sequence-dependent and non-specific modes. PknB phosphorylation of Lsr2 reduced DNA binding, measured by fluorescence anisotropy and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and our NMR structure of phosphomimetic T112D Lsr2 suggests that this may be due to increased dynamics of the DNA-binding domain. Conversely, the phosphoablative T112A Lsr2 had increased binding to certain DNA sites in ChIP-sequencing, and Mtb containing this variant showed transcriptional changes that correspond with the change in DNA binding. In summary, PknB controls Mtb growth and adaptations to the changing host environment by phosphorylating the global transcriptional regulator Lsr2.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679421>Guidelines for Transparency on Gut Microbiome Studies in Essential and Experimental Hypertension.</a></h2><p>Hypertension is a complex and modifiable condition in which environmental factors contribute to both onset and progression.

Effective therapy and vaccination are needed to control viral expansion. However, current anti-IAV drugs risk inducing drug-resistant virus emergence. Although intranasal administration of whole inactivated virus vaccine can induce efficient protective , formalin and β-propiolactone are the currently used and harmful inactivating agents. Here, we analyzed the antiviral activity of hibiscus (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) tea extract against human IAV and evaluated its potential as a novel anti-IAV drug and a safe inactivating agent for whole inactivated vaccine. The in vitro study revealed that the pH of hibiscus tea extract is acidic, and its rapid and potent antiviral activity relied largely on the acidic pH. Furthermore, the mouse study showed that the acidic extract was not effective for either therapeutic or vaccination purposes. However, hibiscus tea extract and protocatechuic , one of the major components of the extract, showed not only potent -dependent antiviral activity but also weak low-pH-independent activity. The low-pH-independent activity did not affect the conformation of immunodominant hemagglutinin protein. Although this low-pH-independent activity is very limited, it may be suitable for the application to medication and vaccination because this activity is not affected by the neutral blood environment and does not lose antigenicity of hemagglutinin.

Polish haemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV) isolates are usually low pathogenic and trigger a subclinical disease. Unfortunately, even the low- pathogenic HEV strains cause severe immunosuppression leading to secondary bacterial infections and huge economic losses. The objective of this study was to evaluate if the influence of Met on HEV infected turkeys immune response can be differentiated by both its level and source. Met is one of the amino  that not only play a nutritional role but also participate in and regulate key metabolic pathways and immune response. In our study, the birds were assigned to 4 dietary treatments which differed in Met levels (0.55 and 0.78% in weeks 1-4 of age and 0.45 and 0.65% in weeks 5-8 of age, respectively) and sources (DL-methionine (DLM) or DL-methionine hydroxy analogue (MHA)).The HEV added the percentage of CD4 cells and decreased the percentage of IgM cells in the blood, spleen and caecal tonsils (CTs) of turkeys. In addition, it increased the percentage of CD4CD25 cells in blood, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) level in plasma. The higher dose of Met led to a significant decrease in the percentages of CD4, CD8 and CD4IL-6 cell subpopulations in the blood of HEV-infected and uninfected turkeys and to an increase in the percentage of IgM B cells in CTs. Turkeys administered feeds with an increased Met content displayed a decrease in plasma IL-6 levels and an increase in plasma IgA levels.The results of this study indicate that HEV infection impairs the immune function in turkeys. Met content in the feed has a moderate effect on the immune response in HEV-infected turkeys. The source of this amino  appears not be as important as its dose, because value of the analysed parameters did not differ significantly between turkeys receiving feeds with DLM or MHA. In the uninfected turkeys, the higher by 40% (than recommended by NRC) level of Met in the feeds had a positive effect on humoral  parameters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683000>A Kruppel-like factor from Macrobrachium rosenbergii (MrKLF) involved in innate  against pathogen infection.</a></h2><p>Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) belong to a family of zinc finger-containing transcription factors that are widely present in eukaryotes. In the present study, a novel KLF from the giant river prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii (designated as MrKLF) was successfully cloned and characterized. The full-length cDNA of MrKLF was 1799 bp with an open reading frame of 1332 bp that encodes a putative protein of 444 amino , including three conserved ZnF_C2H2 domains at the C-terminus. Multiple alignment analysis showed that MrKLF and other crustacean KLFs shared high similarity. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that MrKLF mRNA was found in different tissues of prawns and detected in the gills, hepatopancreas, and intestines. After the challenge with Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Aeromonas hydrophila, different expression patterns of MrKLF in the gills, intestines, and hepatopancreas were observed. RNA interference analysis indicated that MrKLF was involved in regulating the expression of four antimicrobial peptides, namely, Crustin (Crus) 2, Crus8, anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (ALF) 1, and ALF3.

Long regarded merely as inert fat reservoirs, they are now emerging as major regulators of cellular metabolism. They act as hubs that coordinate the pathways of lipid uptake, distribution, storage, and use in the cell. Recent studies have revealed that they are also essential components of the cellular stress response. One of the hallmark characteristics of lipid droplets is their capacity to buffer excess lipids and to finely tune their subsequent release based on specific cellular requirements. This simple feature of lipid droplet biology, buffering and delayed release of lipids, forms the basis for their pleiotropic roles in the cellular stress response. In stressed cells, lipid droplets maintain energy and redox homeostasis and protect against lipotoxicity by sequestering toxic lipids into their neutral lipid core. Their mobility and dynamic interactions with mitochondria enable an efficient delivery of fatty  for optimal energy production. Lipid droplets are also involved in the maintenance of membrane and organelle homeostasis by regulating membrane composition, preventing lipid peroxidation and removing damaged proteins and lipids. Finally, they also engage in a symbiotic relationship with autophagy and act as reservoirs of bioactive lipids that regulate inflammation and . Thus, lipid droplets are central managers of lipid metabolism that function as safeguards against various types of cellular stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521169>The role of collagen in cancer: from bench to bedside.</a></h2><p>Collagen is the major component of the tumor microenvironment and participates in cancer fibrosis. Collagen biosynthesis can be regulated by cancer cells through mutated genes, transcription factors, signaling pathways and receptors; furthermore, collagen can influence tumor cell behavior through integrins, discoidin domain receptors, tyrosine kinase receptors, and some signaling pathways. Exosomes and microRNAs are closely associated with collagen in cancer. Hypoxia, which is common in collagen-rich conditions, intensifies cancer progression, and other substances in the extracellular matrix, such as fibronectin, hyaluronic , laminin, and matrix metalloproteinases, interact with collagen to influence cancer cell activity. Macrophages, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts play a role with collagen in cancer  and progression. Microscopic changes in collagen content within cancer cells and matrix cells and in other molecules ultimately contribute to the mutual feedback loop that influences prognosis, recurrence, and resistance in cancer. Nanoparticles, nanoplatforms, and nanoenzymes exhibit the expected gratifying properties. The pathophysiological functions of collagen in diverse cancers illustrate the dual roles of collagen and provide promising therapeutic options that can be readily translated from bench to bedside. The emerging understanding of the structural properties and functions of collagen in cancer will guide the development of new strategies for anticancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571164>ABC Family Transporters.</a></h2><p>The transport of specific molecules across lipid membranes is an essential function of all living organisms. The processes are usually mediated by specific transporters. One of the largest transporter families is the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family. More than 40 ABC transporters have been identified in human, which are divided into 7 subfamilies (ABCA to ABCG) based on their gene structure, amino  sequence, domain organization, and phylogenetic analysis. Of them, at least 11 ABC transporters including P-glycoprotein (P-GP/ABCB1), multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs/ABCCs), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) are involved in multidrug resistance (MDR) development. These ABC transporters are expressed in various tissues such as the liver, intestine, kidney, and brain, playing important roles in absorption, distribution, and excretion of drugs. Some ABC transporters are also involved in diverse cellular processes such as maintenance of osmotic homeostasis, antigen processing, cell division, , cholesterol, and lipid trafficking. Several human diseases such as cystic fibrosis, sitosterolemia, Tangier disease, intrahepatic cholestasis, and retinal degeneration are associated with mutations in corresponding transporters. This chapter will describe function and expression of several ABC transporters (such as P-GP, BCRP, and MRPs), their substrates and inhibitors, as well as their clinical significance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655268>Rab7 controls innate  by regulating phagocytosis and antimicrobial peptide expression in Chinese mitten crab.</a></h2><p>The Rab family is the most significant subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins. These proteins have widespread intracellular localization and play an important role in many biological processes. Rab7 plays a crucial role in the innate immune system of crustaceans. In the present study, we cloned and characterized Rab7 from Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis), designated EsRab7. The full-length of the EsRab7 cDNA sequence is 1,257 bp and contains a 618-bp open reading frame encoding a 205-amino  polypeptide. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the Rab7 protein was highly conserved during evolution. Quantitative real-time PCR showed the highest tissue expression in muscle, followed by hepatopancreas. EsRab7 was significantly upregulated in hemocytes after stimulation by Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus or Gram-negative Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Further studies showed that EsRab7 knockdown during bacterial stimulation resulted in decreased bacterial phagocytosis. In addition, EsRab7 regulated the expression of antimicrobial peptides via the Toll signaling pathway. Collectively, these results demonstrate that EsRab7 plays critical roles in antimicrobial function in the Chinese mitten crab.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, we established a method to detect CatG activity at the cell surface of natural killer cells by using the activity-based probe MARS116-Bt in flow cytometry. MARS116-Bt consists of biotin, spacer, amino  sequence, and a phosphonate warhead which binds covalently to the serine amino  residue within the active center of CatG. Herein, MARS116 was conjugated to 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) in order to limit non-specific signal-to-noise ratio generally resulting from binding of fluorescein-labelled avidin (avidin-FAM) to biotinylated, intracellular proteins; since MARS116-Bt is incubated with avidin-FAM in a second labelling step. MARS116-FAM was capable to detect intracellular CatG activity, in contrast to the control compound MARS116*-FAM which lacks the functional phosphonate warhead crucial for binding to the active-site of CatG and contains a carboxyl group instead. Furthermore, intracellular CatG activity was determined in CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells as well as in T regulatory cell (Treg) subsets. Thus, MARS116-FAM is a convenient activity-based probe to detect intracellular CatG activity in a flow cytometry approach.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Insight on HBV evolutionary history in the region is limited. We performed a comprehensive epidemiological and phylogenetic reconstruction based on a large cohort of HBV infected patients. Three hundred and nineteen HBV-infected patients with different clinical manifestations, including inactive and active chronic carriers and patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), were enrolled in this study. The full-length large S gene was amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to determine the genotype and subgenotypes of the isolates. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that genotype D is the most dominant genotype among patients. Moreover, this analysis identified two strains with genotype E isolated from active carriers. Detailed phylogenetic analyses confirmed the presence of four HBV D subgenotypes, D1 (93%, n = 296), D2 (0.02%, n = 5), D3 (0.003%, n = 1), and D4 (0.003%, n = 1). In addition, six genotype D strains were not assigned to any existing HBV D subgenotype. The large S gene of eight strains showed signatures of genotype recombination between the genotypes D and A and between D and E. Several strains harbored medically important point mutations at the protein level. Along with the dominance of the HBV genotype D, isolation of the E genotype and several recombinant strains from patients with Saudi Arabian origin is an essential result for decisions involving therapeutic measures for patients. Development of vaccines and detection of diagnostic escape mutations at antigenic epitopes on the HBsAg will be valuable to public health authorities. Furthermore, the diversity at the nucleotide and amino  levels and different proportions of dN/dS at the PreS1, PreS2, and HBsAg reveal the selective pressure trend from inactive status towards advanced liver diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

New data are necessary to understand the key factors involved in the immune system regulation. Six dairy cows were sampled during transition period to investigate the leukocyte transcriptome changes and its relationship with blood biomarkers. Blood samples were collected at - 20 ± 2, - 3 ± 1, 3, and 7 days from parturition (DFP). Leukocyte transcriptome was analyzed by deep sequencing technology (Hiseq1000 Illumina, USA). Plasma was analyzed for metabolic biomarkers. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were used to run an enrichment analysis through the Dynamic Impact Approach (DIA). Considering - 20 DFP as references time, the main KEGG impacted pathways were activated before calving (- 3 DFP) and were connected to lipid metabolism, lipid transport in plasma, and phagosome. The greatest differences were found after parturition with 281 DEG (179 upregulated and 102 downregulated). The activated pathways were mainly related to  and endocrine aspects, while metabolic pathways related to lipid and amino  metabolism were inhibited. Plasma BHBA had a substantial inhibitory impact on KEGG pathways related to DNA replication and cell cycle, while plasma IL-1β had an inhibitory impact on fatty  elongation in mitochondria and an activated impact in several pathways related to cellular energy metabolism. Overall, this study confirmed that many changes in lipid metabolism and immune competence of the circulating leukocytes occurred in dairy cow around calving.

Twenty-four Doper × Small Tail Han ewes (6-7 months of age; 29.07 ± 2.28 kg initial body weight) were randomly assigned to one of three treatments for a 47 d feeding period. Treatments consisted of the sheep diet supplemented with 0% ABP-control, 10% ABP, or 15% ABP of the diet (dry matter basis). Blood samples were collected on days 0, 15, 30, and 45 of the feeding period. APB supplementation did not affect growth performance and apparent digestibility of organic matter, crude protein, and  detergent fibre ( > 0.05). However, ether extract digestibility was decreased in the 10% ABP group and increased in the 15% ABP group ( < 0.001), and both 10% ABP and 15% ABP decreased the neutral detergent fibre digestibility (=0.005). Feeding ABP increased rumen pH ( < 0.001) and ammonia N ( < 0.001) and decreased concentrations of acetate (=0.007) and propionate (=0.001) which resultantly increased the acetate-to-propionate ratio ( < 0.001) in ruminal fluid. There were no interaction effects between treatment and sampling time for plasma metabolites and  ( > 0.05). However, inclusion of dietary 10% ABP decreased concentrations of plasma cholesterol (=0.043). Also, plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein decreased on days 30 and 45 (=0.017) of the feeding period. Metabolite concentrations of total protein, albumin, globulin, blood urea N, glucose, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and humoral immune indicators were not affected ( > 0.05) by dietary ABP supplementation. The results suggest that ABP could be reclaimed through dietary inclusion in animal feed since it had beneficial effects on rumen fermentation patterns and lipid metabolism and had no adverse effects on performance and humoral  in sheep.Copyright © 2019 Abedin Abdallah et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590210>Measurement System for Lossy Capacitive Sensors: Application to Edible Oils Quality Assessment.</a></h2><p>This paper aimed to develop a portable, low-cost, and easy-to-use measurement system for oil quality degradation assessment. The main two chemical parameters affected by frying are the total polar compounds (TPC) and free fatty . The system should characterize the change of chemical parameters by measuring the changes in its dielectric parameters. The dielectric parameters, relative permittivity, and conductivity are measured by measuring the capacitance and resistance of a capacitive sensor dipped in oil. The main challenges are that the corresponding changes of the capacitance and resistance are very small and the presence of stray effects. For this reason, the measurement system should be able to detect changes in capacitance and resistance with high resolution and with good  to stray effects. The proposed measurement system is based on the conversion of impedance to voltage and time and combining, therefore, having two measurement methods in one circuit. In this way, it is possible to measure the dielectric and resistive parameters and not only the relative permittivity as was done in previous works. The results showed a strong correlation between the chemical and electrical parameters with a coefficient of determination in the range of 0.9.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575075>Exportin-1-Dependent Nuclear Export of DEAD-box Helicase DDX3X is Central to its Role in Antiviral .</a></h2><p>DEAD-box helicase 3, X-linked (DDX3X) regulates the retinoic -inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR)-mediated antiviral response, but can also be a host factor contributing to the replication of viruses of significance to human health, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). These roles are mediated in part through its ability to actively shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm to modulate gene expression, although the trafficking mechanisms, and impact thereof on immune signaling and viral infection, are incompletely defined. We confirm that DDX3X nuclear export is mediated by the nuclear transporter exportin-1/CRM1, dependent on an N-terminal, leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) and the monomeric guanine nucleotide binding protein Ran in activated GTP-bound form. Transcriptome profiling and ELISA show that exportin-1-dependent export of DDX3X to the cytoplasm strongly impacts IFN-β production and the upregulation of immune genes in response to infection. That this is key to DDX3X's antiviral role was indicated by enhanced infection by human parainfluenza virus-3 (hPIV-3)/elevated virus production when the DDX3X NES was inactivated. Our results highlight a link between nucleocytoplasmic distribution of DDX3X and its role in antiviral , with strong relevance to hPIV-3, as well as other viruses such as HIV-1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637215>mTOR/HDAC1 Crosstalk Mediated Suppression of ADH1A and ALDH2 Links Alcohol Metabolism to Hepatocellular Carcinoma Onset and Progression .</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is ranked the third deadliest cancer worldwide whose molecular pathogenesis is not fully understood. Although deregulated metabolic pathways have been implicated in HCC onset and progression, the mechanisms triggering this metabolic imbalance are yet to be explored. Here, we identified a gene signature coding catabolic enzymes (Cat-GS) involved in key metabolic pathways like amino , lipid, carbohydrate, drug, and retinol metabolism as suppressed in HCC. A higher expression of deregulated Cat-GS is associated with good survival and less aggressive disease state in HCC patients. On the other hand, we identified mTOR signaling as a key determinant in HCC onset and progression, whose hyperactivation is found associated with poor survival and aggressive disease state in HCC patients. Next, out of Cat-GS, we established two key regulators of alcohol metabolism, alcohol dehydrogenase 1A (ADH1A) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), as being transcriptionally suppressed by histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) at the downstream of mTORC1 signaling. Suppressed ADH1A and ALDH2 expression aligns well with HCC-specific molecular profile and can efficiently predict disease onset and progression, whereas higher ADH1A and ALDH2 expression is associated with good survival and less aggressive disease state in HCC patients. Overall, our  findings suggest that transcriptional suppression of alcohol metabolism regulators, ADH1A and ALDH2, at the downstream of mTOR signaling is, in part, responsible for triggering oncogenic transformation of hepatocytes resulting in disease onset and progression in HCC.Copyright © 2019 Zahid, Yao, Khan, Raza and Gou.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563843>Interactions of high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) with nucleic : Implications in DNA repair and immune responses.</a></h2><p>High mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) is a highly versatile, abundant, and ubiquitously expressed, non-histone chromosomal protein, which belongs to the HMGB family of proteins. These proteins form an integral part of the architectural protein repertoire to support chromatin structure in the nucleus. In the nucleus, the role of HMGB1 is attributed to its ability to bind to undamaged DNA, damaged DNA, and alternative (i.e. non-B) DNA structures with high affinity and subsequently induce bending of the DNA substrates. Due to its binding to DNA, HMGB1 has been implicated in critical biological processes, such as DNA transcription, replication, repair, and recombination. In addition to its intracellular functions, HMGB1 can also be released in the extracellular space where it elicits immunological responses. HMGB1 associates with many different molecules, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipopolysaccharides to modulate a variety of processes in both DNA metabolism and in innate . In this review, we will focus on the implications of the interactions of HMGB1 with nucleic  in DNA repair and immune responses. We report on the roles of HMGB1 in nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision repair (BER), mismatch repair (MMR) and DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR). We also report on its roles in immune responses via its potential effects on antigen receptor diversity generation [V(D)J recombination] and interactions with foreign and self-nucleic . HMGB1 expression is altered in a variety of cancers and immunological disorders. However, due to the diversity and complexity of the biological processes influenced by HMGB1 (and its family members), a detailed understanding of the intracellular and extracellular roles of HMGB1 in DNA damage repair and immune responses is warranted to ensure the development of effective HMGB1-related therapies.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In the current study, we examined the expression patterns and biological functions of tongue sole Cynoglossus semilaevis IL-10 (CsIL-10). CsIL-10 is composed of 186 amino  residues and shares 46.3%-71.7% identities with other teleost IL-10. Csil-10 expression occurred in multiple tissues and was regulated by bacterial infection. Recombinant CsIL-10 (rCsIL-10) in the form of a dimer bound to a wide range of bacterial species but did not affect bacterial growth. rCsIL-10 could interact with peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and significantly reduce the phagocytic activity, ROS production, and apoptosis of PBL. When injected in vivo, rCsIL-10 significantly suppressed the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and promoted bacterial dissemination in tongue sole tissues. Consistently, knockdown of Csil-10 significantly inhibited bacterial infection in tongue sole. Taken together, these results indicate that CsIL-10 plays a negative regulatory role in the immune response against bacterial infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

At the end of the experiment, the growth performance [weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion ratio (FCR)], haematological values [the red blood cell (RBC) count, haemoglobin (Hb) concentration, haematocrit (Ht) level and erythrocyte indices: mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC)], immune response [white blood cell (WBC) count, oxidative radical production (nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) assay), phagocytic activity (PA) and phagocytic index (PI), total protein (TP) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels, serum bactericidal activity (BA), lysozyme (LYZ) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities] and oxidant/antioxidant status [tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities] were analysed. In addition, fish were challenged by Y. ruckeri and survival rate was recorded for 14 days. In the groups fed with EA the growth parameters such as WG, SGR, and FCR did not vary significantly. The RBC count, Hb concentration, and Ht level increased in the groups fed with EA when compared with the control group. However, there were no significant differences in the MCV, MCH and MCHC values among the groups. The results demonstrated enhancement in all the immunological parameters in the groups fed with EA compared to the control group. The results obtained from challenge with Y. ruckeri revealed reduction in the mortalities in the groups fed with EA. The dietary EA stimulated the SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities in liver, head kidney and spleen as compared to the control group; however, a reverse trend was observed in the MDA levels of tissues.

However, the functions of RING finger proteins are still poorly understood in crustaceans.

The full-length cDNA sequence of CqRNF152-like was then identified with 975 bp, including an ORF of 685 bp that encoded a 195 amino  protein, a 5'- UTR of 180 bp, and a 3'-UTR with a poly (A) tail of 207 bp. The conserved domain prediction showed that CqRNF152-like contained a conserved RING-finger domain. Gene expression analysis showed that CqRNF152-like was distributed in all tissues examined and the transcript is significantly up-regulated after WSSV challenge both in vivo in Hpt tissue and in vitro in cultured Hpt cells. Furthermore, the transcripts of both an immediate early gene ie1 and a late envelope protein gene vp28 of WSSV were clearly increased in the Hpt tissues, hemocytes and cultured Hpt cells after gene silencing of CqRNF152-like, which were further proved to be significantly decreased after overloading of recombinant CqRNF152-like protein in Hpt cell cultures. Meanwhile, CqRNF152-like was found to bind with WSSV envelope protein VP28 by proteins pull-down assay. Similar to most of RNF proteins, CqRNF152-like protein sequence contained a conserved RING-finger domain and showed self-ubiquitination activity in a RING finger domain dependent manner. Taken together, CqRNF152-like is likely to function as an antiviral molecular against WSSV infection through interaction with the envelope protein VP28 in a crustacean C. quadricarinatus. This is the first report that a RING finger protein with directly antiviral functions via interaction with viral protein and self-ubiquitination activity in crustacean, which sheds new light on the molecular mechanism of WSSV infection and the control of white spot disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The DEGs were most enriched in pathways related to protein synthesis and amino  metabolism, including "ribosome", "aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis", "pyrimidine metabolism", and "arginine and proline metabolism"; additionally, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism pathways were also activated. A large number of immune-related genes were associated with mucus barrier modification, antimicrobial activity, pathogen attachment and recognition, antioxidant activity, and apoptosis. The expression patterns of several candidate genes involved in the immune response and nutrition metabolism were detected by qPCR. This study provides insight into the transcriptomic modulating mechanisms associated with intestinal  and the metabolism of L. vannamei in response to the intake of dietary SA.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the role of duck STING (DuSTING) in antiviral innate , especially in anti-RNA virus infection, has yet to be elucidated. In this study, the function of DuSTING in IFN induction and its role in anti-RNA virus infections were studied. DuSTING was amplified via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from Pekin duck, showing that its cDNA sequence contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,149 bp and encodes 382 amino  (aa). Sequence alignment showed that DuSTING protein shares 71.1, 43.4, and 33.3% identity with chickens, humans, and zebra fish, respectively. Overexpression of DuSTING in duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) strongly activated IFN-β promotor activity. Deletion mutant analysis revealed that the first 42 aa containing the first transmembrane (TM) domains and the last 32 aa containing a part of the C-terminal tail (CTT) are essential for its IFN-β activation.  experiments showed that the mRNA levels of DuSTING and IFNs were all upregulated when the DEFs were infected with H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) SH010, while overexpression of DuSTING inhibited the replication of this virus.  studies showed that DuSTING mRNA was widely expressed in different tissues, and was up-regulated in the spleen and lung of ducks challenged with SH010. In conclusion, our results indicate that DuSTING is an essential IFN mediator and plays a role in anti-RNA virus innate .Copyright © 2019 Cheng, Liu, Shi, Niu, Zhu, Wang, Ma, Wang, Yan and Sun.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676429>Functional relationship between CgMyD88-1 and CgMyD88-2 in the Pacific oyster.</a></h2><p>MyD88 is a universal adapter protein for the Toll-like receptor/interleukin-1 receptor (TLR/IL-1R) signaling pathway. Since invertebrates are believed to lack MyD88-independent pathways, MyD88 appears more critical in oyster TLR signaling pathway. In the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), two complete paralogues, named as CgMyD88-1 and CgMyD88-2, have been identified. In the current study, we indicated that CgMyD88-1 and CgMyD88-2 might act synergistically to increase the efficiency of immune signaling by activating NF-κB transcription factor. However, we found that upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or polyinosinic:polycytidylic  [poly (I:C)], CgMyD88-1 and CgMyD88-2 show differences in their response: CgMyD88-1 accumulated as large spots in the cytoplasm, while CgMyD88-2 assembled in the cytoplasm and in the membrane. Our results support the theory that expansion of these immune genes is associated with functional diversity.Copyright © 2019.

The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the energy status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by insulin and amino  availability, and its metabolic actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing resistance to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive inflammation and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino  supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; 2) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

These enhance antigen processing and presentation, as well as strengthen DC capacity to stimulate naïve T cell proliferation. Here, we show that in response to the MAMPS lipopolysaccharide and polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic  (Poly I:C), RNA polymerase III (Pol lII)-dependent transcription and consequently tRNA gene expression are strongly induced in DCs. This is in part caused by the phosphorylation and nuclear export of MAF1 homolog negative regulator of Poll III (MAF1), via a synergistic casein kinase 2 (CK2)- and mammalian target of rapamycin-dependent signaling cascade downstream of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). De novo tRNA expression is necessary to augment protein synthesis and compensate for tRNA degradation driven by TLR-dependent DC exposure to type-I IFN. Although protein synthesis is not strongly inhibited in absence of RNA Pol III activity, it compromises the translation of key DC mRNAs, like those coding for costimulatory molecules and proinflammatory cytokines, which instead can be stored in stress granules, as shown for CD86 mRNA. TLR-dependent CK2 stimulation and subsequent RNA Pol III activation are therefore key for the acquisition by DCs of their unique T cell immune-stimulatory functions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578251>Allele-specific nonstationarity in evolution of influenza A virus surface proteins.</a></h2><p>Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major public health problem and a pandemic threat. Its evolution is largely driven by diversifying positive selection so that relative fitness of different amino  variants changes with time due to changes in herd  or genomic context, and novel amino  variants attain fitness advantage. Here, we hypothesize that diversifying selection also has another manifestation: the fitness associated with a particular amino  variant should decline with time since its origin, as the herd  adapts to it. By tracing the evolution of antigenic sites at IAV surface proteins, we show that an amino  variant becomes progressively more likely to become replaced by another variant with time since its origin-a phenomenon we call "senescence." Senescence is particularly pronounced at experimentally validated antigenic sites, implying that it is largely driven by host . By contrast, at internal sites, existing variants become more favorable with time, probably due to arising contingent mutations at other epistatically interacting sites. Our findings reveal a previously undescribed facet of adaptive evolution and suggest approaches for prediction of evolutionary dynamics of pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595865>In Vivo Imaging of Bioluminescent : A Tool to Refine the Murine Buruli Ulcer Tail Model.</a></h2><p>Buruli ulcer (BU) is a neglected tropical disease caused by infection with . Unclear transmission, no available vaccine, and suboptimal treatment regimens hamper the control of this disease. Carefully designed preclinical research is needed to address these shortcomings. In vivo imaging (IVIS) of infection is an emerging tool that permits monitoring of disease progression and reduces the need to using large numbers of mice at different time-points during the experiment, as individual mice can be imaged at multiple time-points. We aimed to further describe the use of in vivo imaging (IVIS) in BU. We studied the detection of  in experimentally infected BALB/c mouse tails and the subsequent histopathology and immune response in this pilot study. IVIS-monitoring was performed weekly in ten infected BALB/c mice to measure light emitted as a proxy for bacterial load.

CaPHL8, an MYB TF, was identified as a positive regulator of pepper defense against Ralstonia solanacerum inoculation (RSI). Phylogenetic evaluation and functional characterization of CaPHL8 revealed its role in pepper defense evolution. Analysis of the amino  sequence of PHL8 demonstrates its maximum similarity with the MYB family transcription factor in other plants. Up-regulation of CaPHL8 was observed in pepper plants facing Ralstonia attack.. Consistently the GUS activity of pCaPHL8 showed significantly high activity under RSI as compared to mock-treated plants. The loss of function studies of CaPHL8 conducted through VIGS (virus-induced gene silencing) confirmed the reduced pepper  to R. solanacearum and impaired plant growth accompanied by high pathogen growth. Compromised pepper  in silenced plants was coupled with a reduction in transcription of defense linked marker genes. On the other hand, transiently overexpressing CaPHL8 (35S::CaPHL8-HA) in pepper caused a hypersensitive response, elevated HO production and high expression of  associated marker genes. Stable expression of CaPHL8-HA protein was confirmed by Western blot. Additionally, unlike many other TFs, CaPHL8 is not involved in high-temperature stress tolerance as evident by phenotype and non-significant transcription of high temperature-tolerance related marker genes in pepper. So, all these findings confirm that CaPHL8 is induced by RSI, not by high temperature and high humidity (HTHH). It provides adaptive plasticity to pepper by activating defense to RSI by direct or indirect regulation of different  -associated genes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Active clinical and environmental surveillance systems with meticulous laboratory investigations provide insights into poliovirus transmission patterns and genomic diversity to inform decisions for strategic operations required to achieve eradication.We analyzed epidemiological and virological data at molecular level to comprehend the current epidemiological status of WPV1 in Pakistan during 2015-2017. Stool specimens of AFP patients and sewage samples collected from 60 active environmental sites. Viral culturing, intratypic differentiation by real time-PCR and nucleic  sequencing of VP1 region of poliovirus genome to determine the genetic relatedness among WPV1 strains were applied. The phylogenetic analysis were done using BEAST v2.3.0 [1] .Poliovirus isolates were grouped into eleven distinct clusters which had ≥95% nucleotide homology in VP1 coding region. Most burden of poliovirus was shared by three major reservoirs i.e. Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta block (64.2% in 2015; 75.4% in 2016 and 76.7% in 2017).Environmental surveillance reveals importations and pockets of unimmunized children which dictate intensive target mop-up campaigns in such areas to contain poliovirus transmission. Decrease in number of orphan isolates reflects effective combination of AFP and ES surveillance working in Pakistan. The genetic data reflects sustained transmission within reservoir areas, further expanded by periodic importations to areas of high  reflected by immediate termination of imported viruses. However, it is suggestive that Pakistan is at-risk unless the entire country including Afghanistan attain a polio-free status. Improved immunization coverage with high quality surveillance is vital for global certification.© The Author(s) 2019.

Here we show that TCR signaling induces expression of amino  transporters, and renders amino -induced activation of mTORC1 in aT reg cells. T reg cell-specific ablation of the Rag family small GTPases RagA and RagB impairs amino -induced mTORC1 signaling, causing defective amino  anabolism, reduced T reg cell proliferation, and a rampant autoimmune disorder similar in severity to that triggered by T reg cell-specific TCR deficiency. Notably, T reg cells in peripheral tissues, including tumors, are more sensitive to Rag GTPase-dependent nutrient sensing. Ablation of RagA alone impairs T reg cell accumulation in the tumor, resulting in enhanced antitumor . Thus, nutrient mTORC1 signaling is an essential component of TCR-initiated T reg cell reprogramming, and Rag GTPase activities may be titrated to break tumor immune tolerance.© 2019 Do et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526105>PAMP-induced peptide 1 cooperates with salicylic  to regulate stomatal  in .</a></h2><p>Various pathogenic species are capable of penetrating plant leaves through stomata on the leaf surface for propagation by absorbing nutrients in plant interiors. Plants have evolved abilities to close stomata to restrict pathogen infections. The model plant  () closes stomata when FLAGELLIN SENSING2 (FLS2), a receptor protein localized in the plasma membrane (PM) of stomatal guard cells, detects flagellin, a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) derived from the bacterial pathogen . It currently remains largely unknown how flagellin-FLS2 signaling initiates stomatal closure. Our previous studies showed that PAMP-INDUCED PEPTIDE1 (PIP1), an  endogenous peptide, activates immune responses through a PM-localized receptor, RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE7 (RLK7). Here, we demonstrate that PIP1-RLK7 act downstream of FLS2 to activate stomatal  against the bacterial strain  pv. tomato () DC3118. PIP1 promotes the expression of genes involved in salicylic  (SA) biosynthesis. SA contributes to the expression of PIP1 preligand prePIP1 and the PIP1-induced stomatal closure. In contrast, methl jasmonate (MJ) and a pathogen-derived jasmonate mimic coronatine (COR) performs an opposite function of SA. SA also promotes the PIP1-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which is required for PIP1-induced stomatal closure. Overall, PIP1 and SA may form a positive feedback loop to regulate ROS-mediated stomatal  in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649546>Inflammation in Renal Diseases: New and Old Players.</a></h2><p>Inflammation, a process intimately linked to renal disease, can be defined as a complex network of interactions between renal parenchymal cells and resident immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, coupled with recruitment of circulating monocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. Once stimulated, these cells activate specialized structures such as Toll-like receptor and Nod-like receptor (NLR). By detecting danger-associated molecules, these receptors can set in motion major innate  pathways such as nuclear factor ĸB (NF-ĸB) and NLRP3 inflammasome, causing metabolic reprogramming and phenotype changes of immune and parenchymal cells and triggering the secretion of a number of inflammatory mediators that can cause irreversible tissue damage and functional loss. Growing evidence suggests that this response can be deeply impacted by the crosstalk between the kidneys and other organs, such as the gut. Changes in the composition and/or metabolite production of the gut microbiota can influence inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, thus offering opportunities to positively manipulate the composition and/or functionality of gut microbiota and, consequentially, ameliorate deleterious consequences of renal diseases. In this review, we summarize the most recent evidence that renal inflammation can be ameliorated by interfering with the gut microbiota through the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics. In addition to these innovative approaches, we address the recent discovery of new targets for drugs long in use in clinical practice. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, NF-ĸB inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and antimetabolic drugs can reduce renal macrophage infiltration and slow down the progression of renal disease by mechanisms independent of those usually attributed to these compounds. Allopurinol, an inhibitor of uric  production, has been shown to decrease renal inflammation by limiting activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. So far, these protective effects have been shown in experimental studies only. Clinical studies will establish whether these novel strategies can be incorporated into the arsenal of treatments intended to prevent the progression of human disease.Copyright © 2019 Andrade-Oliveira, Foresto-Neto, Watanabe, Zatz and Câmara.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563317>High-density genome-wide association study for residual feed intake in Holstein dairy cattle.</a></h2><p>Improving feed efficiency (FE) of dairy cattle may boost farm profitability and reduce the environmental footprint of the dairy industry. Residual feed intake (RFI), a candidate FE trait in dairy cattle, can be defined to be genetically uncorrelated with major energy sink traits (e.g., milk production, body weight) by including genomic predicted transmitting ability of such traits in genetic analyses for RFI. We examined the genetic basis of RFI through genome-wide association (GWA) analyses and post-GWA enrichment analyses and identified candidate genes and biological pathways associated with RFI in dairy cattle. Data were collected from 4,823 lactations of 3,947 Holstein cows in 9 research herds in the United States. Of these cows, 3,555 were genotyped and were imputed to a high-density list of 312,614 SNP. We used a single-step GWA method to combine information from genotyped and nongenotyped animals with phenotypes as well as their ancestors' information. The estimated genomic breeding values from a single-step genomic BLUP were back-solved to obtain the individual SNP effects for RFI. The proportion of genetic variance explained by each 5-SNP sliding window was also calculated for RFI. Our GWA analyses suggested that RFI is a highly polygenic trait regulated by many genes with small effects. The closest genes to the top SNP and sliding windows were associated with dry matter intake (DMI), RFI, energy homeostasis and energy balance regulation, digestion and metabolism of carbohydrates and proteins, immune regulation, leptin signaling, mitochondrial ATP activities, rumen development, skeletal muscle development, and spermatogenesis. The region of 40.7 to 41.5 Mb on BTA25 (UMD3.1 reference genome) was the top associated region for RFI. The closest genes to this region, CARD11 and EIF3B, were previously shown to be related to RFI of dairy cattle and FE of broilers, respectively. Another candidate region, 57.7 to 58.2 Mb on BTA18, which is associated with DMI and leptin signaling, was also associated with RFI in this study. Post-GWA enrichment analyses used a sum-based marker-set test based on 4 public annotation databases: Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, Reactome pathways, and medical subject heading (MeSH) terms. Results of these analyses were consistent with those from the top GWA signals. Across the 4 databases, GWA signals for RFI were highly enriched in the biosynthesis and metabolism of amino  and proteins, digestion and metabolism of carbohydrates, skeletal development, mitochondrial electron transport, , rumen bacteria activities, and sperm motility. Our findings offer novel insight into the genetic basis of RFI and identify candidate regions and biological pathways associated with RFI in dairy cattle.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Very few studies have investigated the associations between KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations and TICs, as well as their prognostic impact on Korean CMMs. Peptide nucleic -mediated polymerase chain reaction clamping and Mutyper and immunohistochemistry were used to detect these mutations in 47 paraffinized CMMs. BRAF and NRAS mutations were detected in 21.3% and 12.8% of CMMs, respectively. No KRAS or PIK3CA mutations were identified. NRAS mutations correlated with low FOXP3 (regulatory T lymphocyte marker) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) (activated dendritic cell marker) TICs in CMMs, which is consistent with the negative correlation of regulatory T cells with NRAS mutations in TCGA data, while BRAF mutations were not associated with any TICs. In gene set enrichment analysis, BRAF and NRAS mutations were enriched in decreased CD8 (suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocyte marker) T cell-linked and increased CD4 (helper/inducer T lymphocyte marker) T cell-linked gene signatures, respectively, confirming the trend in our cohort of associations only with NRAS. BRAF or NRAS mutations alone did not affect any prognosis. In the subgroup analyses, BRAF mutations, as well as high CD4, CD8, FOXP3, and IDO TICs, caused worse overall survival in NRAS-mutated melanoma. No correlation of CD163 (monocyte-macrophage-specific marker) was detected. We found that approximately one-third of our cohort had BRAF and NRAS mutations, none had KRAS or PIK3CA mutations, and most displayed decreased anti-tumor . These findings may warrant further study on combined immunotherapeutic and molecular targeted therapy in Korean CMMs. Subgroup analyses according to TICs and BRAF/NRAS mutations may help to identify high-risk patients with worse prognoses.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Upon binding of the target DNA, Cas12a induces a nick in each of the target DNA strands, yielding a double-stranded DNA break. In addition to inducing cis-cleavage of the targeted DNA, target DNA binding induces trans-cleavage of non-target DNA. As such, Cas12a-RNA guide complexes can provide sequence-specific  against invading nucleic  such as bacteriophages and plasmids. Akin to CRISPR-Cas9, Cas12a has been repurposed as a genetic tool for programmable genome editing and transcriptional control in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In addition, its trans-cleavage activity has been applied for high-sensitivity nucleic  detection. Despite the demonstrated value of Cas12a for these applications, the exact molecular mechanisms of both cis- and trans-cleavage of DNA were not completely understood. Recent studies have revealed mechanistic details of Cas12a-mediates DNA cleavage: base pairing of the RNA guide and the target DNA induces major conformational changes in Cas12a. These conformational changes render Cas12a in a catalytically activated state in which it acts as deoxyribonuclease. This deoxyribonuclease activity mediates cis-cleavage of the displaced target DNA strand first, and the RNA guide-bound target DNA strand second. As Cas12a remains in the catalytically activated state after cis-cleavage, it subsequently demonstrates trans-cleavage of non-target DNA. Here, I review the mechanistic details of Cas12a-mediated cis- and trans-cleavage of DNA. In addition, I discuss how bacteriophage-derived anti-CRISPR proteins can inhibit Cas12a activity.© 2019 The Author(s).

Here, we found that Arabidopsis thaliana PLDδ accumulated in cells at the entry sites of the barley powdery mildew fungus, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh). Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and single-molecule analysis, we observed higher PLDδ density in the plasma membrane after chitin treatment; PLDδ also underwent rapid exocytosis. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FRET-FLIM) showed that the interaction between PLDδ and the microdomain marker AtREMORIN 1.3 (AtREM 1.3) increased in response to chitin, indicating that exocytosis facilitates rapid, efficient sorting of PLDδ into microdomains upon pathogen stimulus. We further unveiled a tradeoff between Brefeldin A (BFA)-resistant and sensitive pathways in secretion of PLDδ under diverse conditions. Upon pathogen attack, PLDδ secretion involved PEN1-associated VAMP721/722-mediated exocytosis sensitive to BFA. Analysis of phosphatidic  (PA), H2O2 and jasmonic  (JA) levels, and expression of related genes indicated that the relocalization of PLDδ is crucial for its activation to produce PA and initiate ROS and JA signaling pathways.

The full-length gene includes an open reading frame (ORF) of 465 amino  residues, and bioinformatic analysis confirmed the high conservation between species. EsGPCR89 was detected in various tissues of E. sinensis, and was up-regulated in brain following Staphylococcus aureus infection. Expression levels of cerebral antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) were also up-regulated following bacterial challenge, reflecting their function in cerebral . Additionally, EsGPCR89 silencing in hemocytes by RNA interference, down-regulated AMPs in brain after S. aureus infection. Moreover, through Immunisation assay and Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) experiments, we could infer that bacterially infected hemocytes released effectors under the regulation of EsGPCR89, thereby activating transcription of cerebral AMPs. These results demonstrate that EsGPCR89 plays important roles in cerebral antimicrobial function via hemocytes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Polyinosinic:polycytidylic  [poly(I:C)] is a synthetic analogue of viral dsRNA that acts as a PAMP, inducing type I interferons (IFNs) in vertebrates. In the present study, the immunostimulatory effects of high molecular weight (HMW) poly(I:C) in rainbow trout cells were measured when bound to a cationic phytoglycogen nanoparticle (Nano-HMW). The physical characteristics of the nanoparticle itself, when bound to different lengths of dsRNA and when cell associated was evaluated.

The immunostimulatory effects of HMW poly (I:C) was compared to Nano-HMW in vitro using the RTgutGC cell line cultured in a conventional monolayer or a transwell culture system. The ability of an activated intestinal epithelium to transmit an antiviral signal to macrophages was evaluated using a co-culture of RTgutGC cells and RTSll (a monocyte/macrophage cell).

Additionally, non-specific  parameters (serum lysozyme (LYZ), peroxidase (POD),  phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities), specific antibody (IgM) production and immune-related genes (MHCIα, MHCIIα, CD4, CD8α, IL-1β and TNFα) were used to evaluate the immune responses induced in vaccinated hybrid snakehead. It proved that all the above-mentioned immune activities were significantly enhanced after immunization with these two DNA vaccines. The protective efficacy of pcDNA-DnaK and pcDNA-GroEL DNA vaccines, in terms of relative percentage survival (RPS), were 53.01% and 80.71% respectively. It demonstrated that these two DNA vaccines could increase the survival rate of hybrid snakehead against fish nocardiosis, albeit with variations in immunoprotective effects. Taken together, these results indicated that both pcDNA-DnaK and pcDNA-GroEL DNA vaccines could boost the innate, humoral and cellular immune response in hybrid snakehead and show highly protective efficacy against fish nocardiosis, suggesting that DnaK and GroEL were promising vaccine candidates. These findings will promote the development of DNA vaccines against fish nocardiosis in aquaculture.Copyright © 2019.

One of such regulatory mechanism is the overexpression of sialic  (Sia) on carbohydrates of proteins and lipids on tumor cells. Sia-containing glycans or sialoglycans were shown to inhibit immune effector functions of NK cells and T cells by engaging inhibitory Siglec receptors on the surface of these cells. They can also modulate the differentiation of myeloid cells into tumor-promoting M2 macrophages. : We review the role of sialoglycans in cancer and introduce the Siglecs, their expression on different immune cells and their interaction with cancer-associated sialoglycans. The targeting of this sialoglycan-Siglec glyco-immune checkpoint is discussed along with potential therapeutic approaches. Pubmed was searched for publications on Siglecs, sialic , and cancer. : The targeting of sialoglycan-Siglec interactions has become a major focus in cancer research. New approaches have been developed that directly target sialic  in tumor lesions. Targeted sialidases that cleave sialic  specifically in the tumor, have already shown efficacy; efforts targeting the sialoglycan-Siglec pathway for improvement of CAR T cell therapy are ongoing. The sialoglycan-Siglec immune checkpoint is a promising new target for cancer immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624591>Low-protein diets supplemented with casein hydrolysate favor the microbiota and enhance the mucosal humoral  in the colon of pigs.</a></h2><p>High-protein diets can increase the colonic health risks. A moderate reduction of dietary crude-protein (CP) level can improve the colonic bacterial community and mucosal  of pigs. However, greatly reducing the dietary CP level, even supplemented with all amino  (AAs), detrimentally affects the colonic health, which may be due to the lack of protein-derived peptides. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of supplementation of casein hydrolysate (peptide source) in low-protein (LP) diets, in comparison with AAs supplementation, on the colonic microbiota, microbial metabolites and mucosal  in pigs, aiming to determine whether a supplementation of casein hydrolysate can improve colonic health under very LP level. Twenty-one pigs (initial BW 19.90 ± 1.00 kg, 63 ± 1 days of age) were assigned to three groups and fed with control diet (16% CP), LP diets (13% CP) supplemented with free AAs (LPA) or casein hydrolysate (LPC) for 4 weeks.Compared with control diet, LPA and LPC diet decreased the relative abundance of  and , and LPC diet further decreased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria. LPC diet also increased the relative abundance of . Both LP diets decreased concentrations of ammonia and cadaverine, and LPC diet also reduced concentrations of putrescine, phenol and indole. Moreover, LPC diet increased total short-chain fatty  concentration. In comparison with control diet, both LP diets decreased protein expressions of Toll-like receptor-4, nuclear factor-κB, interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, and LPC diet further decreased protein expressions of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein-1 and interferon-γ. LPC diet also increased protein expressions of G-protein coupled receptor-43, interleukin-4, transforming growth factor-β, immunoglobulin A and mucin-4, which are indicators for mucosal defense activity.The results showed that supplementing casein hydrolysate showed beneficial effects on the colonic microbiota and mucosal  and barrier function in comparison with supplementing free AAs in LP diets.

To examine the dynamics and locale of the adaptation process of avian influenza viruses when introduced to a mammalian host, we infected ferrets with H5N1 viruses. As expected, all ferrets infected with the human H5N1 isolate A/Vietnam/1203/2004 showed severe disease and virus replication outside the respiratory tract in multiple organs including the brain. In contrast infection of ferrets with the avian H5N1 virus A/Chicken/Laos/Xaythiani26/2006 showed a different collective pattern of infection; many ferrets developed and cleared a mild respiratory infection but a subset (25-50%), showed extended replication in the upper respiratory tract and developed infection in distal sites. Virus from these severely infected ferrets was commonly found in tissues that included liver and small intestine. In most instances the virus had acquired the common virulence substitution PB2 E627K but, in one case, a previously unidentified combination of two amino  substitutions at PB2 S489P and NP V408I, which enhanced polymerase activity, was found. We noted that virus with high pathogenicity adaptations could be dominant in an extra-respiratory site without being equally represented in the nasal wash. Further ferret passage of these mutated viruses resulted in high pathogenicity in all ferrets. These findings illustrate the remarkable ability of avian influenza viruses that avoid clearance in the respiratory tract, to mutate towards a high pathogenicity phenotype during just a single passage in ferrets and also indicate a window of less than 5 days in which treatment may curtail systemic infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552050>Altered Cell Adhesion and Glycosylation Promote Cancer Immune Suppression and Metastasis.</a></h2><p>Cell-cell interactions and cell adhesion are key mediators of cancer progression and facilitate hallmarks of cancer including immune evasion and metastatic dissemination. Many cell adhesion molecules within the tumor microenvironment are changed and significant alterations of glycosylation are observed. These changes in cell adhesion molecules alter the ability of tumor cells to interact with other cells and extracellular matrix proteins. Three families of cell-cell interaction molecules selectins, Siglecs, and integrins have been associated with cancer progression in many pre-clinical studies, yet inhibition of cell adhesion as a therapeutic target is just beginning to be explored.

However, a complete understanding of the function of these compounds in plant  remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome profile in loss-of-function mutant of MYB51, the key transcription factor that controls the biosynthesis of indole glucosinolates. Upon treatment with flg22 (a 22-amino  peptide derived from bacterial flagellin), the genes that responded in a MYB51-dependent manner were analyzed. The results suggested that MYB51 was possibly implicated in most resistance processes, including pathogen recognition, signal transduction and PR protein activation. Of note, several genes in the ethylene pathway and the WRKY family, including WRKY33, were induced by flg22 in a MYB51-dependent manner. WRKY33 and ethylene were demonstrated to be crucial regulators in plant  defense and are functionally upstream of MYB51 during MAMP triggered  (MTI). This result suggested a "positive feedback loop" between MYB51 and its upstream regulators.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, a gene named PcCaspase-3C was found in Procambarus clarkia with a full-length of 4684 bp, including a 1572 bp opening reading frame, which encoded a putative protein of 523 amino . PcCaspase-3C contained a CASc domain constituted of 237 amino . The PcCaspase-3C gene was primarily expressed in heart, stomach, and intestine, while less in gonad, hepatopancreas, gills, and hemocytes, with the least expression in muscle. Infection with Staphyloccocus aureus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus or white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) induced an up-regulated expression of PcCaspase-3C in intestine or stomach to varying degrees. When PcCaspase-3C was silenced by double-stranded RNA, the expression of some antimicrobial peptides such as ALF2, ALF5, ALF6, Cru3, Cru4, and Lys was significantly inhibited. In addition, silencing of PcCaspase-3C accelerated infection with WSSV in vivo. According to these results, we suggest that PcCaspase-3C might play a crucial role in the immune response of P. clarkia against pathogenic bacterial and viral infections.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the rumen epithelium innate immune system can actively respond to the infection. Previous studies have demonstrated G protein-coupled receptors 41 (GPR41) as receptors for short chain fatty  (SCFAs) in human. We hypothesized that SCFAs, the most abundant microbial metabolites in rumen, may regulate the immune responses by GPR41 in bovine rumen epithelial cells (BRECs). Therefore, the objective of study was to firstly establish an immortal BRECs line and investigate the regulatory effects of SCFAs and GPR41 on innate  responses in BRECs. These results showed that long-term BRECs cultures were established by SV40T-induced immortalization. The concentrations of 20 mM SCFAs significantly enhanced the levels of GPR41, IL1β, TNFα, chemokines, and immune barrier genes by transcriptome analysis. Consistent with transcriptome results, the expression of GPR41, IL1β, TNFα, and chemokines were markedly upregulated in BRECs treated with 20 mM SCFAs by qRT-PCR compared with control BRECs. Remarkably, the GPR41 knockdown (GPR41KD) BRECs treated with 20 mM SCFAs significantly enhanced the proinflammatory cytokines IL1β and TNFα expression compared with wild type BRECs treated with 20 mM SCFAs, but reduced the expression of CCL20, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL8, CXCL14, Occludin, and ZO-1. Moreover, GPR41 mRNA expression is positively correlated with CCL20, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCL14, and ZO-1. These findings revealed that SCFAs regulate GPR41-mediated levels of genes involved in immune cell recruitment and epithelial immune barrier and thereby mediate protective innate  in BRECs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649621>Mitochondrial Dysfunction Pathway Networks and Mitochondrial Dynamics in the Pathogenesis of Pituitary Adenomas.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrion is a multi-functional organelle, which is associated with various signaling pathway networks, including energy metabolism, oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, cell cycles, autophagy, and  process. Mitochondrial proteins have been discovered to modulate these signaling pathway networks, and multiple biological behaviors to adapt to various internal environments or signaling events of human pathogenesis. Accordingly, mitochondrial dysfunction that alters the bioenergetic and biosynthetic state might contribute to multiple diseases, including cell transformation and tumor. Multiomics studies have revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and cell cycle dysregulation signaling pathways operate in human pituitary adenomas, which suggest mitochondria play critical roles in pituitary adenomas. Some drugs targeting mitochondria are found as a therapeutic strategy for pituitary adenomas, including melatonin, melatonin inhibitors, temozolomide, pyrimethamine, 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic , gossypol acetate, Yougui pill, T-2 toxin, grifolic , cyclosporine A, dopamine agonists, and paeoniflorin. This article reviews the latest experimental evidence and potential biological roles of mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial dynamics in pituitary adenoma progression, potential molecular mechanisms between mitochondria and pituitary adenoma progression, and current status and perspectives of mitochondria-based biomarkers and targeted drugs for effective management of pituitary adenomas.Copyright © 2019 Li and Zhan.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624397>[Preparation of aspirin sustained-release microsphere and its in vitro releasing property].</a></h2><p>It has been proven that acetylsalicylic  (aspirin), as a kind of classical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, not only has the effect of anti-inflammatory, but also has the function of  regulation and mineralization. However, it needs further investigation to study how to delay release of aspirin for a long time and enable to promote bone regeneration. Herein, we demonstrated that the longterm delayed release pattern of aspirin through the construction of microsphere scaffolds is promising to achieve the excellent bone regeneration.Here we synthesized three kinds of scaffolds as follows: (1) aspirin loaded calcium silicate (CaSiO) microsphere (CaSiO-aspirin) via simple immersion; (2) aspirin loaded polylactic-co-glycolic  (PLGA) microsphere (PLGA-aspirin) via oil/water (O/W) emulsion; (3) aspirin loaded PLGA-CaSiO scaffold (PLGA-CaSiO-aspirin) via O/W emulsion, optimal morphology and structure of PLGA-CaSiO-aspirin scaffold was acquired through modulating the ratio between PLGA and CaSiO. Furthermore, spectrophotometer was used to monitor the concentration of the extract of the three scaffolds for different releasing time, including 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 13, 17, 21, 24, 30, 36, and 45 days, aspirin loading efficiency and its accumulation releasing curves were both achieved according to the concentration of aspirin. Their sustained release effects of aspirin were evaluated eventually.Environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) results showed that the surface structure of the three kinds of scaffolds were smooth and had uniform size distribution. In addition, a small amount of PLGA-aspirin microspheres occurred to aggregation, while a small amount of CaSiO-aspirin microspheres were broken. Moreover, the PLGA-aspirin microspheres in the PLGA-CaSiO-aspirin scaffolds were uniformly adhered to the surface of CaSiO microspheres. The aspirin loadings of CaSiO-aspirin, PLGA-aspirin, and PLGA-CaSiO-aspirin were (1.06±0.04)%, (7.05±0.06)%, and (6.75±0.18)%, respectively. In addition, their corresponding time for releasing 95% of aspirin was 3, 24, and 36 days, respectively. The releasing time of PLGA-CaSiO-aspirin was longer than that of the others and the releasing rate was more stable.The microsphere scaffold of PLGA-CaSiO-aspirin composites has excellent delayedrelease effect on aspirin, which is promising for using as osteogenic materials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31558024>Combretastatin A4 Nanoparticles Combined with Hypoxia-Sensitive Imiquimod: A New Paradigm for the Modulation of Host Immunological Responses during Cancer Treatment.</a></h2><p>Vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) have great potential in cancer treatment. However, in addition to their direct tumoral vascular collapse effect, VDAs activate host immunological responses, which can remarkably impair their anticancer efficacy. Here, a VDA nanomedicine, poly(l-glutamic )--methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)/combretastatin A4 (CA4-NPs), is found to induce the intratumor infiltration of immature plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), thereby curtailing anticancer . To overcome this problem, hypoxia-sensitive imiquimod (hs-IMQ) is developed, which is selectively activated into imiquimod (IMQ) in treated tumors following the catalysis of CA4-NPs-induced nitroreductase (NTR). The combination of hs-IMQ and CA4-NPs causes a 6.3-fold enhancement of active IMQ concentration in tumors, as compared to hs-IMQ treatment alone. The -generated IMQ alters the tumor microenvironment from a state of immunosuppression to immune activation. Hs-IMQ achieves this effect through the conversion of immature pDCs into their active form, leading to the robust infiltration and priming of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in treated tumors. Thus, the CA4-NPs and hs-IMQ combination treatment synergistically inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. This work offers new approaches to harness intratumor pDCs to reverse the immune suppression resulting from VDA treatment. These findings additionally provide a mechanistic rationale for the use of VDAs in combination with TLR agonists to trigger  immune activation and enhance anticancer efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669309>A novel ML domain-containing protein (SpMD2) functions as a potential LPS receptor involved in anti-Vibrio immune response.</a></h2><p>The myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD2)-related lipid-recognition (ML) proteins display diverse biological functions in host  and lipid metabolism by interacting with different lipids. Human MD2, an indispensable accessory protein in TLR4 signaling pathway, specifically recognizes lipopolysaccharides (LPS), thereby leading to the activation of TLR4 signaling pathway to produce many effectors that participate in inflammatory and immune responses against Gram-negative bacteria. Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) pathways are first characterized in Drosophila and are reportedly present in crustaceans, but the recognition and activation mechanism of these signaling pathways in crustaceans remains unclear. In the present study, a novel ML protein was characterized in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) and designated as SpMD2. The complete SpMD2 cDNA sequence is 1114 bp long with a 465 bp open reading frame; it encodes a protein that contains 154 amino  (aa). In the deduced protein, a signal peptide (1-21 aa residues) and a ML domain (43-151 aa residues) were predicted. SpMD2 shared a similar three-dimensional structure and a close evolutionary relationship with human MD2. SpMD2 was highly expressed in gills, hemocytes, intestine, and hepatopancreas and was upregulated in gills and hemocytes after challenges with bacteria, thereby suggesting its involvement in antibacterial defense. Western blot assay showed that SpMD2 possesses strong binding activities to different bacteria and two fungi. ELISA demonstrated that SpMD2 exhibits binding abilities to LPS, lipid A, peptidoglycan (PGN), and lipoteichoic  (LTA). Its binding ability to LPS and lipid A were stronger than to PGN or LTA, implying that SpMD2 was an important LPS-binding protein in mud crab. Bacterial clearance assay revealed that the pre-incubation of Vibrio parahemolyticus with SpMD2 facilitates bacterial clearance in vivo and that knockdown of SpMD2 dramatically suppresses the bacterial clearance and decreases the expression of several antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Furthermore, SpMD2 overexpression could enhance the promoter activity of SpALF2. These results revealed that SpMD2 affects bacterial clearance by regulating AMPs. Thus, by binding to LPS and by regulating AMPs, SpMD2 may function as a potential receptor, which is involved in the recognition and activation of a certain immune signaling pathway against Gram-negative bacteria. This study provides new insights into the diverse functions of ML proteins and into the antibacterial mechanisms of crustaceans.Copyright © 2019.

Although NETosis in general has been suggested to be glucose dependent, the transferability to patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is unclear. We assessed whether the NETs markers double-stranded deoxyribonucleid  (dsDNA) and myeloperoxidase-DNA (MPO-DNA) associated with plasma glucose and the glucometabolic status in the acute phase and 3 months after a STEMI. We also explored whether an acute glucose load resulted in upregulated NETosis by assessment of peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) gene expression.In total, 224 STEMI patients were prospectively enrolled and underwent blood sampling acutely (median 16.5 h after PCI) and after 3 months. Glucometabolic status was defined based on the results of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as normal glucose regulation (NGR), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or type 2 diabetes (T2DM). dsDNA and MPO-DNA were measured in serum, while PAD4 mRNA was measured in circulating leukocytes by RT-PCR.dsDNA levels were significantly correlated to plasma glucose both acutely and after 3 months (r = 0.12 and r = 0.17, both p < 0.02), whereas MPO-DNA was not. No associations with the glucometabolic status were encountered for dsDNA and MPO-DNA acutely, but after 3 months dsDNA levels were elevated in patients with IFG and T2DM vs. NGR (428 vs. 371 ng/ml and 408 vs. 371 ng/ml, both p < 0.045). During the acute glucose load after 3 months, dsDNA and MPO-DNA remained unchanged while PAD4 mRNA increased significantly (RQ 0.836 vs. 0.920, p = 0.02).In this cohort of STEMI patients, levels of dsDNA associated with plasma glucose both in the acute and stable condition. The glucometabolic status was not substantially related to the selected NETs markers, however, an acute glucose load by OGTT performed after 3 months resulted in increased PAD4 expression, suggestive of enhanced NETosis in the aftermath of STEMI.www.clinicaltrials.gov,  .

Single-chain variable fragments (scFv), comprised of only the variable regions of antibody heavy and light chains, are smaller molecules that may offer advantages over full-length IgG. We designed and expressed scFv of HIV bNAbs prioritized for clinical testing that target the V2-apex (CAP256-VRC26.25), V3-glycan supersite (PGT121), CD4 binding site (3BNC117) and MPER (10E8v4). The use of either a 15 or 18 amino  Glycine-Serine linker between the heavy and light chain fragments provided adequate levels of scFv expression. When tested against a 45 multi-subtype virus panel, all four scFv retained good neutralizing activity although there was variable loss of function compared to the parental IgG antibodies. For CAP256-VRC26.25, there was a significant 138-fold loss of potency that was in part related to differential interaction with charged amino  at positions 169 and 170 in the V2 epitope. Potency was reduced for the 3BNC117 (13-fold) and PGT121 (4-fold) scFv among viruses lacking the N276 and N332 glycans respectively, and in viruses with a longer V1 loop for PGT121. This suggested that scFv interacted with their epitopes in subtly different ways, with variation at key residues affecting scFv neutralization more than the matched IgGs. Remarkably, the scFv of 10E8v4 maintained breadth of 100% with only a minor reduction in potency. Overall scFv of clinically relevant bNAbs had significant neutralizing activity indicating that they may be suitable for passive immunization to prevent HIV-1 infection. Monoclonal antibodies have been isolated against conserved epitopes on the HIV trimer and are being investigated for passive immunization. Some of the challenges associated with full-sized antibody proteins may be overcome by using single-chain variable fragments (scFv). These smaller forms of antibodies can be produced more efficiently, may show fewer off-target effects with increased tissue penetration and are more adaptable to vectored-mediated expression compared to IgG. Here we demonstrate that scFv of four HIV-directed bNAbs (CAP256-VRC26.25, PGT121, 3BNC117 and 10E8v4) had significant neutralizing activity against diverse global strains of HIV. Loss of potency and/or breadth was shown to be due to increased dependence of the scFv on key residues within the epitope. These smaller antibody molecules with functional activity in the therapeutic range may be suitable for further development as passive  for HIV prevention.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620124>Altered Lipid Tumor Environment and Its Potential Effects on NKT Cell Function in Tumor .</a></h2><p>Natural killer T (NKT) cells are CD1d restricted T cells that mostly recognize lipid antigens. These cells share characteristics with both adaptive and innate immune cells and have multiple immunoregulatory roles. In a manner similar to innate immune cells, they respond quickly to stimuli and secrete large amounts of cytokines, amplifying and modulating the immune response. As T cells, they express T cell receptors (TCRs) and respond in an antigen-specific manner like conventional T cells. There are at least two subtypes of NKT cells, type I and type II, that differ in the nature of their TCR, either semi-invariant (type I) or diverse (type II). The two sub-types generally have opposing functions in tumor , with type I promoting and type II suppressing tumor , and they cross-regulate each other, forming an immunoregulatory axis. The tumor has multiple mechanisms by which it can evade immune-surveillance. One such mechanism involves alteration in tumor lipid repertoire and accumulation of lipids and fatty  that favor tumor growth and evade anti-tumor . Since NKT cells mostly recognize lipid antigens, an altered tumor lipid metabolic profile will also alter the repertoire of lipid antigens that can potentially affect their immune-modulatory function. In this review, we will explore the effects of alterations in the lipid metabolites on tumor growth, antigen cross-presentation, and overall effect on anti-tumor , especially in the context of NKT cells.Copyright © 2019 Tiwary, Berzofsky and Terabe.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31542719>Fasciola gigantica: Ultrastructural cytochemistry of the tegumental surface in newly- excysted metacercariae and in vitro-penetrated juvenile flukes informs a concept of parasite defence at the interface with the host.</a></h2><p>Cytochemical staining techniques were carried out en bloc with in vitro excysted and gut-penetrated Fasciola gigantica larvae in order to visualise the glycocalyx of the tegument, a structure which comprises the parasite component of the host-parasite interface, yet is incompletely preserved by conventional fixation and preparation techniques for electron microscopy. Positive reactivity with ruthenium red and periodic -thiocarbohydrazine-osmium (PATCO) techniques revealed that the glycocalyx is polyanionic and carbohydrate-rich throughout its depth. It comprises a trilaminate arrangement, with a thin dense zone and fibrillar layer closely apposed to the outer aspect of the apical plasma membrane, invested by an irregular thick mucopolysaccharide capsule. The latter, not recorded in adult flukes, may represent a specific adaptation to facilitate invasion in the face of host , and may also protect the parasite surface from the action of host- and parasite-derived proteases. Early in the invasion of a naïve host, the glycocalyx may be partly responsible for triggering the responses of innate , while later in infection, or when an anamnestic response is initiated in an immunocompetent host, the antibodies and activated lymphocytes of specific acquired  are invoked to interact with the parasite surface. The cytochemical properties of the glycocalyx, together with its potential for dynamic turnover due to exocytosis of the T0 tegumental secretory bodies, are likely to aid neutralisation of potentially damaging immune effectors and ensure their removal from the vicinity of the parasite by sloughing in complex with glycocalyx components.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Four practical diets at three levels of chitosan (1, 5 and 10 g/kg) were fed to loach (3.13 ± 0.02 g) in triplicate groups (20 fish per replicate) for 10 weeks. Contrary to high-chitosan treatment, the administration of low or moderate levels of oral chitosan (1 or 5 g/kg) significantly increased the body weight gain, specific growth rate and condition factor. The oral administration of chitosan significantly increased the survival rate, phenoloxidase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, lysozyme,  phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase activities, as well as the immunoglobulin M and complement 3 contents and the disease resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila. The optimum dose of dietary chitosan required for the maximum growth of loach was 5 g/kg. These results indicated that chitosan exerted immunostimulatory effects on loaches (M. anguillicadatus) and can thus be used as a dietary supplement.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

And they play important roles in the systemic defenses against microbial invasion. In this study, a new full-length cDNA of the crustins molecule was identified in red swamp crayfish, P. clarkii (named Pc-crustin 4). The ORF of Pc-crustin 4 contained 369 bp which encoded a protein of 122 amino , with a 20-amino- signal peptide sequence. On the base of the classification method established by Smith et al., Pc-crustin 4 belonged to Type Ⅰ crustin molecule. The Pc-crustin 4 transcripts were expressed in hemocytes at relatively high level, and relatively low level in hepatopancreas, gills, and intestine in normal crayfish. After respectively challenged with S. aureus or E. ictaluri, the expression levels of Pc-crustin 4 showed up-regulation trends at different degrees in the hemocytes, hepatopancreas, gills, and intestine tissues. Besides, the results of liquid antibacterial assay showed that rPc-crustin 4 inhibited obviously the growth of S. aureus and E. ictaluri. The results of bacteria binding assay showed that rPc-crustin 4 could bind strongly to S. aureus and E. ictaluri. Finally, RNAi assay was performed to study the  roles of Pc-crustin 4 in crayfish in vivo. Taken together, Pc-crustin 4 is an important  effector molecule, which plays crucial roles in defending against bacterial infection in crayfish.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the potential of Trichoderma reesei has been investigated as a biofertilizer (BF) to ameliorate nutrient stress in different rice cultivars at physiological, biochemical and molecular levels. The results indicated that cultivar Heena is much more compatible with BF as compared to cultivar Kiran at 50% nutrient limiting condition. Enhancement in physiological attributes and photosynthetic pigments were observed in BF treated Heena seedlings. The localization of biofertilizer in treated roots was further validated by scanning electron micrographs. This result correlated well with the higher levels of Indole acetic  and Gibberellic  in biofertilizer treated rice. Similarly, the uptake of micro-nutrients such as Fe, Co, Cu and Mo was found to be 1.4-1.9 fold higher respectively in BF treated Heena seedlings under 50% nutrient deficient condition. Furthermore, different stress ameliorating enzymes Guaiacol peroxidase, Super oxide dismutase, Total Phenolic Content, Phenol Peroxidase, Phenylalanine ammonia lyase and Ascorbate peroxidase in Heena seedlings were also increased by 1.8, 1.4, 1.2, 2.4, 1.2, and 8.3-fold respectively, at 50% nutrient deficient condition. The up-regulation of different micro and macro-nutrients allocation and accumulation; metal tolerance related; auxin synthesis genes in BF treated Heena as compared to 50% nutrient deficient condition was further supported by our findings that the application of biofertilizer efficiently ameliorated the deficiency of nutrients in rice.Copyright © 2019.

We examined the role of JMJ14, a Jumonji (JMJ) domain containing H3K4 demethylase, in local and systemic plant immune responses in Arabidopsis. The function of JMJ14 in local or systemic defense response was investigated by pathogen growth assays and by analyzing expression and H3K4me3 enrichments of key defense genes using qPCR and ChIP-qPCR. Salicylic  (SA) and pipecolic  (Pip) levels were quantified and function of JMJ14 in SA- and Pip-mediated defenses was analyzed in Col-0 and jmj14 plants. jmj14 mutants were compromised in both local and systemic defenses. JMJ14 positively regulates pathogen-induced H3K4me3 enrichment and expression of defense genes involved in SA- and Pip-mediated defense pathways. Consequently, loss of JMJ14 results in attenuated defense gene expression and reduced Pip accumulation during establishment of systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Exogenous Pip partially restored SAR in jmj14 plants, suggesting that JMJ14 regulated Pip biosynthesis and other downstream factors regulate SAR in jmj14 plants.

In this study, a 405 bp cDNA sequence of galectin 1-like 2 (CiGal1-L2) was obtained from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), which encoded 134 amino  with a predicted molecular mass of 15.143 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.33. The sugar binding motifs (H-N-R, V-N and W--E-R) were detected in carbohydrate-binding domain (CRD). The amino  sequence similarity showed that CiGal1-L2 was 40.30-42.54% and 66.42-81.20% similarity to mammalian and fish counterparts, respectively. The phylogenetic tree showed that CiGal1-L2 was clustered with fish galectin-1s and closely related to Cyprinus carpio. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis revealed that CiGal1-L2 was widely expressed in all tested tissues. In addition, the expression of CiGal1-L2 was differentially up-regulated challenged with grass carp reovirus (GCRV), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyinosinic:polycytidylic  (poly I:C). The fluorescence of CiGal1-L2-GFP was distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of HEK 293T cells and showed a trend of nuclear translocation after LPS and poly I:C treatment.

Our current understanding of cell wall-mediated resistance is largely based on the degree of pectin methylesterification. However, little is known about the role of pectin acetylesterification in plant . This study describes how one pectin-modifying enzyme, PECTIN ACETYLESTERASE 9 (PAE9), affects the Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome, secondary metabolome and aphid performance. Electro-penetration graphs showed that Myzus persicae aphids established phloem feeding earlier on pae9 mutants. Whole-genome transcriptome analysis revealed a set of 56 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between uninfested pae9-2 mutants and wild-type plants. The majority of the DEGs were enriched for biotic stress responses and downregulated in the pae9-2 mutant, including PAD3 and IGMT2, involved in camalexin and indole glucosinolate biosynthesis, respectively. Relative quantification of more than 100 secondary metabolites revealed decreased levels of several compounds, , including camalexin and oxylipins, in two independent pae9 mutants. In addition, absolute quantification of phytohormones showed that jasmonic  (JA), JA-isoleucine, salicylic , abscisic , and indole-3-acetic  were compromised due to PAE9 loss of function. After aphid infestation, however, pae9 mutants increased their levels of camalexin, glucosinolates and JA, and no long-term effects were observed on aphid fitness. Overall, these data show that PAE9 is required for constitutive upregulation of defense-related compounds, but that it is not required for aphid-induced defenses. The signatures of phenolic antioxidants, phytoprostanes and oxidative stress-related transcripts indicate that the processes underlying PAE9 activity involve oxidation-reduction reactions.{copyright, serif} 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

This study investigated the effect of  DSM25840 or  DSM25841 supplementation on growth, health, , intestinal functionality and microbial profile of post-weaning pigs after enterotoxigenic  (ETEC) F4 challenge.Sixty-four post-weaning piglets (7748 g ± 643 g) were randomly allocated to four groups: control basal diet (CO); CO + 1.28 × 10 CFU/g of  (BAA); CO + 1.28 × 10 CFU/g feed of  (BAS); CO + 1 g colistin/kg of feed (AB). At day (d) 7, animals were challenged with 10 CFU/mL of ETEC F4ac O149 and then followed for fecal score and performance until d 21. Blood was collected at d 6, d 12 and d 21 for immunoglobulins, at d 8 for acute phase proteins, at d 8 and d 21 for metabolomics analysis. Jejunum was sampled for morphometry, quantification of apoptosis, cell proliferation, neutral and  mucine and IgA secretory cells, and microarray analysis at d 21. Jejunum and cecum contents were collected for microbiota at d 21.AB and BAS reduced the fecal score impairment compared to CO ( < 0.05) at d 14. Body weight (BW), average daily weight gain (ADWG), average daily feed intake (ADFI) and gain to feed ratio (G:F) did not differ between  groups and CO. AB improved BW at d 7, d 14 and d 21, ADWG ADFI and G:F from d 0 to d 7 ( < 0.05). At d 8, CO had higher plasma arginine, lysine, ornithine, glycine, serine and threonine than other groups, and higher haptoglobin than AB ( < 0.05). At d 21, CO had lower blood glycine, glutamine and IgA than BAS. Morphology, cells apoptosis and mucins did not differ. BAS and AB increased the villus mitotic index. Transcriptome profile of BAS and AB were more similar than CO. Gene sets related to adaptive immune response were enriched in BAA, BAS and AB. CO had enriched gene set for nuclear structure and RNA processing. CO had a trend of higher Enterobacteriaceae in cecum than the other groups ( = 0.06).

The atypical profilin Arabidopsis AtPRF3 has been reported to cooperate with canonical profilin isoforms in suppressing formin-mediated actin polymerization during plant innate  responses. AtPRF3 has a 37-amino--long N terminal extension (NTE), and its suppressive effect on actin assembly is derived from enhanced interaction with the poly-proline (Poly-P) of the formin AtFH1. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we solved the crystal structures of AtPRF3Δ22 and AtPRF3Δ37, as well as AtPRF2 apo form and in complex with AtFH1 Poly-P at 1.5-3.6 Å resolutions. By combining these structures with molecular modeling, we found that AtPRF3Δ22 NTE has high plasticity, with a primary "closed" conformation that can adopt an open conformation that enables Poly-P binding. Furthermore, using molecular dynamics simulation and free-energy calculations of protein-protein binding, along with experimental validation, we show that the AtPRF3Δ22 binds to Poly-P in an adaptive manner, thereby enabling different binding modes that maintain the interaction through disordered sequences. Together, our structural and simulation results suggest that the dynamic conformational changes of the AtPRF3 NTE upon Poly-P binding modulate their interactions to fine-tune formin-mediated actin assembly.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647987>Thymosin-β12 characteristics and function in Urechis unicinctus.</a></h2><p>β-thymosin family comprise a series of heat-stable multifunctional polypeptides involved in actin regulation, anti-inflammation, wound healing, cell migration, angiogenesis, cardiac protection, antimicrobial processes and antiviral . The roles of Tβ12 (thymosin-β12) in marine invertebrates is still largely unknown, especially in terms of antibacterial . In this study, we cloned the Tβ12 gene with an ORF of 126 bp coding 41 amino  from Urechis unicinctus. Tissue distribution analysis by qRT-PCR used TBP as reference gene showed that Tβ12 was widely expressed in all tissues, and the transcript levels were the highest in the body wall, followed by the coelomic fluid, and the lowest in the intestines and anal sacs. After LPS (lipopolysaccharides) injection, Tβ12 expression in the body was first elevated significantly at 3 h (p < 0.05), indicating that the body wall was the first defense line of the innate immune system; in the coelomic fluid, the Tβ12 mRNA levels increased after LPS injection, with a significant increase occurring at 6 h, showing that coelomic fluid functioned as the second defense line of the innate immune system. In the midgut and anal sacs, a significant increase in the Tβ12 level occurred at 24 h, suggesting that the midgut and anal sacs may act as accessory organs for the innate immune system. Moreover, U. unicinctus Tβ12 recombinants can effectively inhibit the growth of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. These results indicate that U. unicinctus Tβ12 plays important roles in innate antibacterial immune responses, which can deepen our understanding of Tβ12 in marine invertebrates.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD). Probiotics may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative colitis patients, probiotics remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti-inflammatory capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic -induced murine model of colitis. The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of colitis that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of probiotics.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Pigs play a central role in the cross-species reassortment of IAV. Ectodomain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) is the most conserved protective antigen in IAV and can be used to develop nanovaccines through nanoparticles displaying to increase its immunogenicity. However, the high immunogenicity of nanoparticles can cause the risk of off-target immune response, and excess unwanted antibodies may interfere with the protective efficacy of M2e-specific antibodies. Therefore, it is necessary to select reasonable nanoparticles to make full use of antibodies against nanoparticles while increasing the level of M2e-specific antibodies. Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the most susceptible virus in pigs and can promote IAV infection. It is meaningful to develop a vaccine that can simultaneously control swine influenza virus (SIV) and PCV2.In the present study, M2e of different copy numbers were inserted into the capsid (Cap) protein of PCV2 and expressed in  to form self-assembled chimeric virus-like particles (VLPs) nanovaccine. BALB/c mice and pigs were immunized with these nanovaccines to explore optimal anti-IAV and anti-PCV2 .Cap is capable of carrying at least 81 amino  residues (three copies of M2e) at its C-terminal without impairing VLPs formation. Cap-3M2e VLPs induced the highest levels of M2e-specific immune responses, conferring protection against lethal challenge of IAVs from different species and induced specific immune responses consistent with PCV2 commercial vaccines in mice. In addition, Cap-3M2e VLPs induced high levels of M2e-specific antibodies and PCV2-specific neutralizing antibodies in pigs.Cap-3M2e VLP is an economical and promising bivalent nanovaccine, which provides dual protection against IAV and PCV2.© 2019 Ding et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659824>Proteomics Profiling of Swine Serum Following Lipopolysaccharide Stimulation.</a></h2><p>There are no approved animal drugs for management of inflammation in swine due to lack of validated animal models.

Retinoids have multiple actions and play important roles in regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, vision, bone growth, tumor suppression and . The effects of retinoids are thought to be mediated by their binding to and activation of the retinoic  and retinoid X receptors which regulate gene expression, important in normal growth and differentiation. Vitamin A in doses that have medical effects was found to be toxic, particularly when given long term. Modification of the vitamin A structure led to retinoid molecules that had many of its beneficial, but fewer of its adverse effects. Oral retinoids in use in the United States include acitretin for psoriasis and isotretinoin for severe nodular acne. Tretinoin is used topically and several other retinoids have been developed for therapy of uncommon forms of cancer (alitretinoin, bexarotene). The commonly used retinoids have many of the side effects of vitamin A including dry skin, cheilosis and nosebleeds and hair loss, but are not stored in the liver and do not cause the typical form of chronic liver disease associated with excessive vitamin A intake. Both acitretin and isotretinoin are teratogenic and embryotoxic and are contraindicated in women who are or intend to become pregnant. Retinoids have been implicated in causing mild-to-moderate elevations in routine liver tests, but these elevations are usually asymptomatic and transient, resolving spontaneously even with continued therapy. Marked elevations in serum aminotransferase levels during retinoid therapy are uncommon, and dose adjustment or drug discontinuation are rarely required for liver test abnormalities. Nevertheless, laboratory monitoring is recommended with routine liver tests at baseline and one month later, and testing thereafter only if abnormalities were found or symptoms arise. Several retinoids (acitretin, etretinate, retinal acetate) have been associated with a clinically apparent acute liver injury which typically arises during the first 3 months of therapy, has many features of hypersensitivity and can be severe and even fatal. Interestingly, isotretinoin often causes mild serum aminotransferase elevations and is commonly listed as having frequent adverse effects on the liver, but it has not been convincingly linked to instances of severe clinically apparent, acute liver injury with jaundice. Two retinoids used in dermatology, acitretin and isotretinoin, are discussed in this record and their combined references of retinoids are provided at the end of this introductory section.

Here, we describe the identification of an aspartic protease, designated PecA, that removes (part of) this PE domain at the cell surface. Nearly all of the observed PE_PGRS proteins are processed by PecA. Interestingly, the protease itself is also a secreted PE protein and subject to self-cleavage.

The role of this metabolic pathway in macrophage response and function is unknown. We show that the enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) is induced in macrophages infected with pathogenic bacteria through signaling involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/MTOR and the transcription factor SP1. This results in the synthesis of cystathionine, which facilitates the survival of pathogens within myeloid cells. Our data demonstrate that the expression of CTH leads to defective macrophage activation by (i) dysregulation of polyamine metabolism by depletion of -adenosylmethionine, resulting in immunosuppressive putrescine accumulation and inhibition of spermidine and spermine synthesis, and (ii) increased histone H3K9, H3K27, and H3K36 di/trimethylation, which is associated with gene expression silencing. Thus, CTH is a pivotal enzyme of the innate immune response that disrupts host defense. The induction of the reverse transsulfuration pathway by bacterial pathogens can be considered an unrecognized mechanism for immune escape. Macrophages are professional immune cells that ingest and kill microbes. In this study, we show that different pathogenic bacteria induce the expression of cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) in macrophages. This enzyme is involved in a metabolic pathway called the reverse transsulfuration pathway, which leads to the production of numerous metabolites, including cystathionine. Phagocytized bacteria use cystathionine to better survive in macrophages. In addition, the induction of CTH results in dysregulation of the metabolism of polyamines, which in turn dampens the proinflammatory response of macrophages. In conclusion, pathogenic bacteria can evade the host immune response by inducing CTH in macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668391>miR-873-5p targets mitochondrial GNMT-Complex II interface contributing to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a complex pathology in which several dysfunctions, including alterations in metabolic pathways, mitochondrial functionality and unbalanced lipid import/export, lead to lipid accumulation and progression to inflammation and fibrosis. The enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), the most important enzyme implicated in S-adenosylmethionine catabolism in the liver, is downregulated during NAFLD progression. We have studied the mechanism involved in GNMT downregulation by its repressor microRNA miR-873-5p and the metabolic pathways affected in NAFLD as well as the benefit of recovery GNMT expression.miR-873-5p and GNMT expression were evaluated in liver biopsies of NAFLD/NASH patients. Different in vitro and in vivo NAFLD murine models were used to assess miR-873-5p/GNMT involvement in fatty liver progression through targeting of the miR-873-5p as NAFLD therapy.We describe a new function of GNMT as an essential regulator of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain in the mitochondria. In NAFLD, GNMT expression is controlled by miR-873-5p in the hepatocytes, leading to disruptions in mitochondrial functionality in a preclinical murine non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model. Upregulation of miR-873-5p is shown in the liver of NAFLD/NASH patients, correlating with hepatic GNMT depletion. Importantly, NASH therapies based on anti-miR-873-5p resolve lipid accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis by enhancing fatty  β-oxidation in the mitochondria. Therefore, miR-873-5p inhibitor emerges as a potential tool for NASH treatment.GNMT participates in the regulation of metabolic pathways and mitochondrial functionality through the regulation of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain. In NAFLD, GNMT is repressed by miR-873-5p and its targeting arises as a valuable therapeutic option for treatment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

It plays important roles in antiviral  and production of microRNAs. In the present study, a Dicer gene was identified from oyster Crassostrea gigas, and its open reading frame (ORF) encoded a polypeptide (designed as CgDicer) of 1873 amino  containing two conserved ribonuclease III domains (RIBOc) and a double-stranded RNA-binding motif (DSRM). The deduced amino  sequence of CgDicer shared identities ranging from 18.5% to 46.6% with that of other identified Dicers. The mRNA transcripts of CgDicer were detectable in all the examined tissues of adult oysters, with the highest expression in hemocytes (11.21 ± 1.64 fold of that in mantle, p < 0.05). The mRNA expression level of CgDicer in hemocytes was significantly up-regulated (36.70 ± 11.10 fold, p < 0.01) after the oysters were treated with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). In the primarily cultured oyster hemocytes, the mRNA transcripts of CgDicer were significantly induced at 12 h after the stimulation with poly(I:C), which were 2.04-fold (p < 0.05) higher than that in control group. Immunocytochemistry assay revealed that CgDicer proteins were mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of hemocytes. The two most important functional domains of CgDicer, DSRM and RIBOc, were recombinant expressed in Escherichia coli transetta (DE3), and the recombinant DSRM protein displayed significantly binding activity to dsRNA and poly(I:C) in vitro, while the recombinant RIBOc protein exhibited significantly dsRNase activity to cleave dsRNA in vitro. These results collectively suggested that CgDicer functioned as either an intracellular recognition molecule to bind dsRNA or an effector with ribonuclease activity, which might play a crucial role in anti-viral  of oyster.Copyright © 2019.

Cow urine has not been investigated for the presence of these peptides using MALDI-TOF-MS.The aim of this study is to isolate, identify and assess the antimicrobial activity of urinary antimicrobial peptides from healthy normal cycling cows.We analyzed the urine sample using diafiltration, ion exchange chromatography, reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC),  urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (AU-PAGE) coupled with identification through peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The in-vitro antimicrobial effects of purified fractions were assessed using radial diffusion assay (RDA) and microtitre broth dilution assay against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.Proteins corresponding to the peaks were identified using SWISSPROT protein database. This study revealed constitutive expression of β-Defensin-1 (DEFB1), β-Defensin-4A (DFB4A), Neutrophil Defensin-1 (DEF1), Neutrophil Defensin-3 (DEF3) in cow urine. The identified peptides are cationic antimicrobial peptides of the defensin family. The purified fractions exhibited antimicrobial effects in radial diffusion assay and MIC values in the range of 2.93-29.3 µM/L.This study concludes that cow urine, previously unexplored with regard to antimicrobial peptides, would be a promising source of highly potent AMPs and an effective alternative to the resistant antibiotics.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560198>Gold Nanoparticles Coimmobilized with Small Molecule Toll-Like Receptor 7 Ligand and α-Mannose as Adjuvants.</a></h2><p>Adjuvants enhance the immune response during vaccination. Among FDA-approved adjuvants, aluminum salts are most commonly used in vaccines. Although aluminum salts enhance humoral , they show a limited effect for cell-mediated immune responses. Thus, further development of adjuvants that induce T-cell-mediated immune response is needed. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognizing specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns activate innate , which is crucial to shape adaptive . Using TLR ligands as novel adjuvants in vaccines has therefore attracted substantial attention. Among them a small molecule TLR7 ligand, imiquimod, has been approved for clinical use, but its use is restricted to local administration due to unwanted adverse side effects when used systematically. Since TLR7 is mainly located in the endosomal compartment of immune cells, efficient transport of the ligand into the cells is important for improving the potency of the TLR7 ligand. In this study we examined gold nanoparticles (GNPs) immobilized with α-mannose as carriers for a TLR7 ligand to target immune cells. The small molecule synthetic TLR7 ligand, 2-methoxyethoxy-8-oxo-9-(4-carboxy benzyl)adenine (1V209), and α-mannose were coimmobilized via linker molecules consisting of thioctic  on the GNP surface (1V209-αMan-GNPs). The in vitro cytokine production activity of 1V209-αMan-GNPs was higher than that of the unconjugated 1V209 derivative in mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In the in vivo immunization study, 1V209-αMan-GNPs induced significantly higher titers of IgG2c antibody specific to ovalbumin as an antigen than did unconjugated 1V209, and splenomegaly and weight loss were not observed. These results indicate that 1V209-αMan-GNPs could be useful as safe and effective adjuvants for development of vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610823>Dietary phytase and -inositol supplementation are associated with distinct plasma metabolome profile in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>Phytase enzyme is used as a dietary supplement in broiler nutrition to improve phosphorous bioavailability. Phytase deliberates phosphate groups from phytic  and produces myo-inositol after total dephosphorylation. Myo-inositol is a bioactive compound having beneficial modulatory effects on metabolism in humans. However, it is not well understood if and how phytic  degradation products, particularly myo-inositol, can modulate metabolism in broiler chicken. The purpose of this study was to investigate effects of dietary supplements of phytase and myo-inositol on the blood plasma metabolome profile of broiler chickens. Broilers were provided a nutrient-adequate control diet or the same diet supplemented with either 3.5 g myo-inositol or 500, 1500 or 3000 units of phytase, per kilogram of feed (grower diet). Broilers were group-housed in floor pens (eight pens per diet) and provided one of the treatment diets for 22 days. Then, blood was collected from one bird per pen, resulting in eight replicated measurements per diet. A targeted metabolomics approach was applied to the heparin plasma. Body weight of the birds was not significantly affected by the treatments. Plasma myo-inositol concentrations were significantly increased by myo-inositol supplementation and phytase supplementation at 500 and 1500 units/kg. Metabolites generally affected by phytase supplementation belonged to the groups of acyl-carnitines, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidylcholine, biogenic amines and amino . Compared to the control diet, phytase supplements had significantly higher plasma concentrations of kynurenine and creatinine, but lower concentrations of histamine and cis-4-hydroxyproline. Myo-inositol supplementation significantly increased plasma concentrations of dopamine and serotonine. While some metabolites were similarly affected by myo-inositol and phytase supplementation, others were distinctly differently affected. We conclude that myo-inositol, either as a directly added supplement or indirectly released from phytate upon phytase supplementation, can affect specific metabolic pathways. Additional effects found on phytase supplementation may be related to intermediary phytate degradation products. Results are indicative for innovative hypothesis to be tested in future experiments, for instance, with regard to relationships between phytase or myo-inositol supplements and bird  or behaviour.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583765>Why most insects have very low proportions of C20 polyunsaturated fatty : The oxidative stress hypothesis.</a></h2><p>Eicosanoids, a group of C20 oxygenated polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs), mediate various physiological processes, such as , reproduction, excretion, and metabolism in insects. Arachidonic  (AA) is used for the main precursor for the production of various eicosanoids. However, most terrestrial insects possess relatively low AA levels. Insects are presumed to be evolved since the Paleozoic era, at which oxygen levels might be much higher than current conditions. Compared with other animals, they exhibit relatively high metabolic rates with the well-developed tracheal system, which directly supply enough oxygen to active tissues like flight muscles. This might allow insects to be susceptible to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from high oxidative catabolism. Long-chain PUFAs including AA is usually reacted with ROS and become peroxidized. Peroxidized PUFAs cause various cellular damage. Thus, we propose a hypothesis that terrestrial insects minimize AA levels to minimize oxidative stress.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680997>Simulated Weightlessness Perturbs the Intestinal Metabolomic Profile of Rats.</a></h2><p>Recently, disorders of intestinal homeostasis in the space environment have been extensively demonstrated. Accumulating evidence have suggested microgravity and simulated weightlessness could induce dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota, which may contribute to the bowel symptoms during spaceflight. However, the specific responses of intestinal metabolome under simulated weightlessness and its relationship with the intestinal microbiome and immune characteristics remain largely unknown. In the current study, 20 adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into the control group and the simulated weightlessness group using a hindlimb unloading model. The metabolomic profiling of cecal contents from eight rats of each group was investigated by gas chromatography-time of flight/mass spectrometry. The significantly different metabolites, biomarkers, and related pathways were identified. Multivariate analysis, such as principal component analysis and orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis, demonstrated an obvious separation between the control group and the simulated weightlessness group. Significantly different metabolites, such as xylose, sinapinic , indolelactate, and digalacturonic , were identified, which participate in mainly pyrimidine metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and valine, leucine and isoleucine metabolism. Cytidine-5'-monophosphate, 4-hydroxypyridine, and phloretic  were determined as pivotal biomarkers under simulated weightlessness. Moreover, the significantly different metabolites were remarkably correlated with dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and disturbance of immunological characteristics induced by simulated weightlessness. These metabolic features provide crucial candidates for therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders under weightlessness.Copyright © 2019 Jin, Wang, Zhang, Zhou and Zhao.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673770>Mice expressing the variant rs1143679 allele of ITGAM (CD11b) show impaired DC-mediated T cell proliferation.</a></h2><p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and functional genomic analyses have implicated several ITGAM (CD11b) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the development of SLE and other disorders. ITGAM encodes the α chain of the β integrin Mac-1, a receptor that plays important roles in myeloid cell functions. The ITGAM SNP rs1143679, which results in an arginine to histidine change at amino  position 77 of the CD11b protein, has been shown to reduce binding to several ligands and to alter Mac-1-mediated cellular response in vitro. Importantly, however, the potential contribution of this SNP variant to the initiation and/or progression of immune and inflammatory processes in vivo remains unexplored. Herein, we describe for the first time the generation and characterization of a mouse line expressing the 77His variant of CD11b. Surprisingly, we found that 77His did not significantly affect Mac-1-mediated leukocyte migration and activation as assessed using thioglycollate-induced peritonitis and LPS/TNF-α-induced dermal inflammation models. In contrast, expression of this variant did alter T cell , as evidenced by significantly reduced proliferation of ovalbumin (OVA)-specific transgenic T cells in 77His mice immunized with OVA. Reduced antigen-specific T cell proliferation was also observed when either 77His splenic dendritic cells (DCs) or bone marrow-derived DCs were used as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Although more work is necessary to determine how this alteration might influence the development of SLE or other diseases, these in vivo findings suggest that the 77His variant of CD11b can compromise the ability of DCs to induce antigen-driven T cell proliferation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615393>ChromaClade: combined visualisation of phylogenetic and sequence data.</a></h2><p>Studying site-specific amino  frequencies by eye can reveal biologically significant variability and lineage-specific adaptation. This so-called 'sequence gazing' often informs bioinformatics and experimental research. But it is important to also account for the underlying phylogeny, since similarities may be due to common descent rather than selection pressure, and because it is important to distinguish between founder effects and convergent evolution. We set out to combine phylogenetic and sequence data to produce evolutionarily insightful visualisations.We present ChromaClade, a convenient tool with a graphical user-interface that works in concert with popular tree viewers to produce colour-annotated phylogenies highlighting residues found in each taxon and at each site in a sequence alignment. Colouring branches according to residues found at descendent tips also quickly identifies lineage-specific residues and those internal branches where key substitutions have occurred. We demonstrate applications of ChromaClade to human immunodeficiency virus and influenza A virus datasets, illustrating cases of conservative, adaptive and convergent evolution.We find this to be a powerful approach for visualising site-wise residue distributions and detecting evolutionary patterns, especially in large datasets.

The NF-κB activation process includes nuclear translocation, followed by association with basal transcription machinery. These steps are tightly regulated by posttranslational modification of the proteins involved in this pathway. We recently reported that NF-κB transactivation activity is enhanced by knockdown of diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ), which belongs to an enzyme family that phosphorylates lipidic second messenger diacylglycerol to phosphatidic . To investigate details of the regulatory mechanism exerted by DGKζ, we identified DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX5 as a novel DGKζ-interacting protein and examined functional role of DDX5 in NF-κB transactivation activity. Here we show that DDX5 knockdown exerts no significant effect on nuclear translocation, but specifically attenuates Ser311 phosphorylation of p65 subunit. Luciferase reporter assay reveals that the NF-κB transcriptional activity is repressed in DDX5-knockdown cells. Furthermore, we found that DDX5 knockdown selectively downregulates the expression level of Bcl-2 of the NF-κB-inducible anti-apoptotic factors upon TNF-α stimulation. Considering the evidence collectively, we can infer that DGKζ-interacting multi-protein complex modulates the NF-κB transactivation activity in a negative and positive manner under conditions in which the expression level of a component of the complex is altered.Copyright © 2019.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been known as key modulators of gene expression in response to environmental stresses, disease resistance, defense responses, and plant . However, the role of miRNAs in responses to  remains unexplored in tea plant. Therefore, in the present study, six miRNA sequencing data sets and two degradome data sets were generated from -inoculated and control tea leaves. A total of 485 conserved and 761 novel miRNAs were identified. Of those, 239 known and 369 novel miRNAs exhibited significantly differential expression under  stress. One thousand one hundred thirty-four and 596 mRNAs were identified as targets of 389 conserved and 299 novel miRNAs by degradome analysis, respectively. Based on degradome analysis, most of the predicted targets are negatively correlated with their corresponding conserved and novel miRNAs. The expression levels of 12 miRNAs and their targets were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. A negative correlation between expression profiles of five miRNAs (PC-5p-80764_22, csn-miR160c, csn-miR828a, csn-miR164a, and csn-miR169e) and their targets (WRKY, ARF, MYB75, NAC, and NFY transcription factor) was observed. The predicted targets of five interesting miRNAs were further validated through 5'RLM-RACE. Furthermore, Gene Ontology and metabolism pathway analysis revealed that most of the target genes were involved in the regulation of auxin pathway, ROS scavenging pathway, salicylic  mediated pathway, receptor kinases, and transcription factors for plant growth and development as well as stress responses in tea plant against  stress. This study enriches the resources of stress-responsive miRNAs and their targets in  and thus provides novel insights into the miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms, which could contribute to the enhanced susceptibility of  in tea plant.Copyright © 2019 Jeyaraj, Wang, Wang, Liu, Zhang, Wu and Wei.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661176>New insights into the mycobacterial PE and PPE proteins provide a framework for future research.</a></h2><p>The PE and PPE proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been studied with great interest since their discovery.

The molecular mechanism of flavivirus assembly is not well understood. Here, we show that Zika virus (ZIKV) NS2A protein recruits genomic RNA, the structural protein prM/E complex, and the NS2B/NS3 protease complex to the virion assembly site and orchestrates virus morphogenesis. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that ZIKV NS2A binds to prM, E, NS2B, and NS3 (but not C, NS4B, or NS5) in a viral RNA-independent manner, whereas prM/E complex does not interact with NS2B/NS3 complex. Remarkably, a single-amino- mutation (E103A) of NS2A impairs its binding to prM/E and NS2B/NS3 and abolishes virus production, demonstrating the indispensable role of NS2A/prM/E and NS2A/NS2B/NS3 interactions in virion assembly. In addition, RNA-protein pulldown analysis identified a stem-loop RNA from the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome as an "RNA recruitment signal" for ZIKV assembly. The 3' UTR RNA binds to a cytoplasmic loop of NS2A protein. Mutations of two positively charged residues (R96A and R102A) from the cytoplasmic loop reduce NS2A binding to viral RNA, leading to a complete loss of virion assembly. Collectively, our results support a virion assembly model in which NS2A recruits viral NS2B/NS3 protease and structural C-prM-E polyprotein to the virion assembly site; once the C-prM-E polyprotein has been processed, NS2A presents viral RNA to the structural proteins for virion assembly. ZIKV is a recently emerged mosquito-borne flavivirus that can cause devastating congenital Zika syndrome in pregnant women and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. The molecular mechanism of ZIKV virion assembly is largely unknown. Here, we report that ZIKV NS2A plays a central role in recruiting viral RNA, structural protein prM/E, and viral NS2B/NS3 protease to the virion assembly site and orchestrating virion morphogenesis. One mutation that impairs these interactions does not significantly affect viral RNA replication but selectively abolishes virion assembly, demonstrating the specific role of these interactions in virus morphogenesis. We also show that the 3' UTR of ZIKV RNA may serve as a "recruitment signal" through binding to NS2A to enter the virion assembly site. Following a coordinated cleavage of C-prM-E at the virion assembly site, NS2A may present the viral RNA to C protein for nucleocapsid formation followed by envelopment with prM/E proteins. The results have provided new insights into flavivirus virion assembly.Copyright © 2019 Zhang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547135>Hepatitis E Virus Entry.</a></h2><p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is a major cause of acute hepatitis worldwide.

A commonly used model of the plant immune system is divided into a general response triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and a specific response triggered by effectors. The first type of response is known as PAMP triggered  (PTI), and the second is known as effector-triggered  (ETI). To obtain better insight into changes of protein abundance in  reactions, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis of a PTI and two different ETI models (relating to ) in potato. Several proteins showed higher abundance in all immune reactions, such as a protein annotated as sterol carrier protein 2 that could be interesting since  species are sterol auxotrophs. RNA binding proteins also showed altered abundance in the different immune reactions. Furthermore, we identified some PTI-specific changes of protein abundance, such as for example, a glyoxysomal fatty  beta-oxidation multifunctional protein and a MAR-binding protein. Interestingly, a lysine histone demethylase was decreased in PTI, and that prompted us to also analyze protein methylation in our datasets. The proteins upregulated explicitly in ETI included several catalases. Few proteins were regulated in only one of the ETI interactions. For example, histones were only downregulated in the ETI-Avr2 interaction, and a putative multiprotein bridging factor was only upregulated in the ETI-IpiO interaction.

High-throughput small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens provide a systematic approach for the identification of novel host-virus interactions. Here, we report a large-scale screen for host factors important for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), consisting of 6,881 siRNAs. We identified 47 proviral factors and 68 antiviral factors involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including the mediator complex, proteasome function, and mRNA splicing. Focused characterization of one of the hits, asparagine synthetase (ASNS), demonstrated a strict requirement for asparagine for HCMV replication which leads to an early block in virus replication before the onset of DNA amplification. This effect is specific to HCMV, as knockdown of ASNS had little effect on herpes simplex virus 1 or influenza A virus replication, suggesting that the restriction is not simply due to a failure in protein production. Remarkably, virus replication could be completely rescued 7 days postinfection with the addition of exogenous asparagine, indicating that while virus replication is restricted at an early stage, it maintains the capacity for full replication days after initial infection. This study represents the most comprehensive siRNA screen for the identification of host factors involved in HCMV replication and identifies the nonessential amino  asparagine as a critical factor in regulating HCMV virus replication. These results have implications for control of viral latency and the clinical treatment of HCMV in patients. HCMV accounts for more than 60% of complications associated with solid organ transplant patients. Prophylactic or preventative treatment with antivirals, such as ganciclovir, reduces the occurrence of early onset HCMV disease. However, late onset disease remains a significant problem, and prolonged treatment, especially in patients with suppressed immune systems, greatly increases the risk of antiviral resistance. Very few antivirals have been developed for use against HCMV since the licensing of ganciclovir, and of these, the same viral genes are often targeted, reducing the usefulness of these drugs against resistant strains. An alternative approach is to target host genes essential for virus replication. Here we demonstrate that HCMV replication is highly dependent on levels of the amino  asparagine and that knockdown of a critical enzyme involved in asparagine synthesis results in severe attenuation of virus replication. These results suggest that reducing asparagine levels through dietary restriction or chemotherapeutic treatment could limit HCMV replication in patients.Copyright © 2019 Lee et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551352>Identification of lipophilic ligands of Siglec5 and 14 that modulate innate immune responses.</a></h2><p>Sialic -binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) are a family of cell-surface immune receptors that bind to sialic  at terminal glycan residues.

Biochemical approaches revealed that the Siglec ligands are fungal alkanes and triacylglycerols, an unexpected finding that prompted us to search for endogenous lipid ligands of Siglecs. Siglec5 weakly recognized several endogenous lipids, but the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin and the anti-inflammatory lipid 5-palmitic -hydroxy stearic  exhibited potent ligand activity on Siglec5. Further, the hydrophobic stretch in the Siglec5 N-terminus region was found to be required for efficient recognition of these lipids. Notably, this hydrophobic stretch was dispensable for recognition of sialic . Siglec5 inhibited cell activation upon ligand binding, and accordingly, the lipophilic ligands suppressed interleukin-8 (IL-8) production in Siglec5-expressing human monocytic cells.

However, results from epidemiological investigations have been inconsistent, and especially studies using biomarkers for assessment of polyphenol intake have been scant. We aimed to characterize the association between plasma concentrations of 35 polyphenol compounds and low-grade systemic inflammation state as measured by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). A cross-sectional data analysis was performed based on 315 participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort with available measurements of plasma polyphenols and hsCRP. In logistic regression analysis the odds and 95% confidence intervals (CI-s) of elevated serum hsCRP (>3 mg/L) were calculated within quartiles and per standard deviation (SD) higher level of plasma polyphenol concentrations. In multivariable-adjusted model, the sum of plasma concentrations of all polyphenols measured (per SD) was associated with 29% lower odds of elevated hsCRP (95% CI: 50%-1%). In the class of flavonoids, daidzein was inversely associated with elevated hsCRP (OR= 0.66, 95%CI 0.46-0.96).

T cells have distinct energetic and anabolic needs when nascently activated, actively proliferating, in naïveté, or in a resting, memory state. As a consequence, bioenergetics are key for T cells to mount adequate immune responses in health and disease. Solid tumors are particularly hostile metabolic environments, characterized by low glucose concentration, hypoxia, and low pH. These metabolic conditions in the tumor are known to hinder antitumor immune responses of T cells by limiting nutrient availability and energetic efficiency. In such immunosuppressive environments, artificial modulation of glycolysis, mitochondrial respiratory capabilities, and fatty  β-oxidation are known to enhance antitumor performance. Reportedly, costimulatory molecules, such as CD28 and CD137, are important regulators of metabolic routes in T cells. In this sense, different costimulatory signals and cytokines induce diverse metabolic changes that critically involve mitochondrial mass and function. For instance, the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) encompassing costimulatory domains, agonist antibodies to costimulatory receptors, and checkpoint inhibitors depends on the associated metabolic events in immune cells. Here, we review the metabolic changes that costimulatory receptors can promote in T cells and the potential consequences for cancer immunotherapy. Our focus is mostly on discoveries regarding the physiology and pharmacology of IL15, CD28, PD-1, and CD137 (4-1BB).©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540475>Development of Salmonellosis as Affected by Bioactive Food Compounds.</a></h2><p>Infections caused by  serovars are the leading cause of foodborne hospitalizations and deaths in Americans, extensively prevalent worldwide, and pose a considerable financial burden on public health infrastructure and private manufacturing. While a comprehensive review is lacking for delineating the role of dietary components on prevention of Salmonellosis, evidence for the role of diet for preventing the infection and management of Salmonellosis symptoms is increasing. The current study is an evaluation of preclinical and clinical studies and their underlying mechanisms to elaborate the efficacy of bioactive dietary components for augmenting the prevention of  infection. Studies investigating dietary components such as fibers, fatty , amino , vitamins, minerals, phenolic compounds, and probiotics exhibited efficacy of dietary compounds against Salmonellosis through manipulation of host bile , mucin, epithelial barrier, innate and adaptive  and gut microbiota as well as impacting the cellular signaling cascades of the pathogen. Pre-clinical studies investigating synergism and/or antagonistic activities of various bioactive compounds, additional randomized clinical trials, if not curtailed by lack of equipoise and ethical concerns, and well-planned epidemiological studies could augment the development of a validated and evidence-based guideline for mitigating the public health burden of human Salmonellosis through dietary compounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681252>S-Layer Protein of  SBT2171 Promotes Human β-Defensin 2 Expression via TLR2-JNK Signaling.</a></h2><p>Antimicrobial peptides that contribute to innate  are among the most important protective measures against infection in many organisms. Several substances are known to regulate the expression of antimicrobial peptides. In this study, we investigated the factors in lactic  bacteria (LAB) that induce antimicrobial peptide expression in the host. We found that  SBT2171 (LH2171) induced the expression of human β-defensin (hBD)2 in Caco-2 human colonic epithelial cells. Specifically, surface layer protein (SLP) of LH2171 stimulated hBD2 expression by activating c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling via Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 in Caco-2 cells. SLPs extracted from other lactobacilli similarly increased hBD2 expression, suggesting that this stimulatory effect is common feature of  SLPs. Interestingly,  strains that strongly induced hBD2 expression also potently activated JNK signaling. Thus, upregulation of hBD2 induced by TLR2-JNK signaling contributes to protection of the host against infection.Copyright © 2019 Kobatake and Kabuki.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678185>Comparative study of host-associated and commercial probiotic effects on serum and mucosal immune parameters, intestinal microbiota, digestive enzymes activity and growth performance of roach (Rutilus rutilus caspicus) fingerlings.</a></h2><p>The study aimed to isolate host-associated probiotic (HAP) lactic  bacteria from intestine of adult Caspian roach and compare the efficacy of HAP with a commercially available probiotic strain (Pediococcus acidilactici) on the growth and feed utilisation, digestive enzymes and systemic and mucosal immune system of roach fingerling. The HAP strain isolated from roach intestine was Enterococcus faecium strain CGMCC1.2136. The experiment was a simple completely randomized design and lasted for eight weeks. Two hundred and seventy fish with an average weight of 12 g randomly distributed into nine tanks. The trial consisted of three treatments with three respective replications. During the experimental period, fish received basal diet without any bacterial supplementation (as the control group), basal diet enriched with 10 CFU g HAP or 10 CFU g CP. At the end of the experiment, serum immune parameters of those fish fed HAP including alkaline phosphatase activity, total protein content, total immunoglobulin level, lysozyme activity and complement activity (ACH50) were significantly higher that other experimental groups (P < 0.05). Similarly, dietary supplementation of HAP resulted in better mucosal immune parameters in comparison to control group and commercial probiotic administration (P < 0.05). Intestinal heterotrophic bacteria and autochthonous LAB counts of those fish fed HAP were significantly higher than other experimental groups at the end of the experiment as well as 15 days seizing probiotic administrations (P < 0.05). Fish fed with HAP containing diet presented significantly higher amylase, lipase and protease activity in comparison to the CP fed fish and the control group (P < 0.05). Growth indices of those fish fed HAP were significantly higher than other treatments (P < 0.05). The highest carcass protein and ash content along with the lowest body moisture content belonged to those fish received HAP (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the use host-HAP resulted in better immune competence and growth performance and it seems aquaculture sector should probably focus on the development of probiotics isolated from the cultured species instead of using terrestrial probiotics with greatly different requirements and environmental conditions.Copyright © 2019.

Most members of the root microbiome possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens [2]. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host  and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root microbiota, including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [5, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root microbiome. In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic  and its derivative 2-keto gluconic . Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic  and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic -mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root . Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root microbiome, as it facilitates colonization by beneficial root microbiota.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut dysbiosis, OSA and gut dysbiosis, and whether gut dysbiosis is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut dysbiosis." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing gut dysbiosis at an early stage through prebiotics and probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH.

However, little is known about CL-11 in teleosts. In the present study, a CL-11 homolog was identified and characterized from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) (designated as CsCL-11). The full-length cDNA of CsCL-11 is 1220 bp long and includes a 5'untranslated region (5'-UTR) of 180 bp, a 3'-UTR of 218 bp and an open reading frame (ORF) of 819 bp encoding 273 amino . Multiple sequence alignment revealed that the deduced CsCL-11 protein has the typical modular architecture (EPN and WTD) conserved throughout vertebrates, suggesting a conserved function of CsCL-11. Tissue expression profile analysis by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed CsCL-11 to be ubiquitously distributed in tissues and highly expressed in the ovary and liver. A pattern of significant upregulation of CsCL-11 expression was observed in the blood, spleen, head kidney and gill at 6 h, 12h and 24h after infection with Vibrio anguillarum, and western blotting showed that natural CsCL-11 protein levels in the blood were significantly increased after V. anguillarum infection. Moreover, by binding to various bacteria, recombinant CsCL-11 (rCsCL-11) expressed in HEK-293T cells displayed strong antibacterial activity. Taken together, these results suggest that CsCL-11 is a unique C-type lectin that is likely involved in host defense against bacterial infection.

The contribution of humoral , including B cell and antibody responses against HBV, has been investigated for a long time but has attracted increasing attention again in recent years. The anti-HBs antibody was first recognized as a marker of protective  after the acute resolution of the HBV infection (or vaccination) and is now defined as a biomarker for the functional cure of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). In this way, therapies targeting HBV-specific B cells and the induction of an anti-HBs antibody response are essential elements of a rational strategy to terminate chronic HBV infection. However, a high load of HBsAg in the blood, which has been proposed to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance, represents a major obstacle to curing CHB. Long-term antiviral treatment by nucleoside analogs, by targeting viral translation by siRNA, by inhibiting HBsAg release via nucleic  polymers, or by neutralizing HBsAg via specific antibodies could potentially reduce the HBsAg load in CHB patients. A combined strategy including a reduction of the HBsAg load via the above treatments and the therapeutic targeting of B cells by vaccination may induce the appearance of anti-HBs antibodies and lead to a functional cure of CHB.Copyright © 2019 Ma, Zhang, Gao, Xiong and Lu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520948>Digital gene expression analysis in the gills of Ruditapes philippinarum after nitrite exposure.</a></h2><p>Due to the overload of pollutants from highly intensive anthropic activities, nitrite accumulates in offshore seawater and has been a long-lasting pollutant to the healthy aquaculture of the mollusk. In the present study, Ruditapes philippinarum was used as the target bivalve to receive nitrite exposure at environmental concentration for 1 and 7 days. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected and analyzed by a digital gene expression (DGE) approach to describe the toxicity of nitrite on the bivalve at the gene level. In the N1 group, 185 DEGs were generated and enriched in six Gene Ontology (GO) terms, including oxidoreductase activity, heme binding, tetrapyrrole binding, iron ion binding, metal binding and cation binding. The DEGs in the N1 group were also enriched in two Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, e.g., arachidonic  metabolism and ovarian steroidogenesis. In the N7 group, 81 DEGs were generated without any GO enrichment but were enriched in five KEGG pathways, including protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, protein export, prion diseases, thyroid hormone synthesis and arachidonic  metabolism. This suggested that nitrite exposure might cause adverse effects to the clams in several aspects, including oxidative damage, depressed , and disorders in cell proliferation, hormone metabolism and tissue regeneration. Evaluation of oxidative stress indicated that nitrite exposure actually induced redox state imbalance by enhancing the contents of thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARSs) and glutathione (GSH), and the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) but not superoxide dismutase (SOD). These results will provide valuable gene references for further study on the toxicology mechanism of bivalves under environmental nitrite stress.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It does so by acting as a sensor that intercepts antibody-coated viruses that have evaded extracellular neutralization and breached the cell membrane. Upon engagement of the Fc of antibodies bound to viruses, TRIM21 triggers a coordinated effector and signaling response that prevents viral replication while at the same time inducing an anti-viral cellular state. This dual effector function is tightly regulated by auto-ubiquitination and phosphorylation. Therapeutically, TRIM21 has been shown to be detrimental in adenovirus based gene therapy, while it may be favorably utilized to prevent tau aggregation in neurodegenerative disorders.

The purified lectin lysed vertebrate erythrocytes with effective haemolysis of ox red blood cells (RBCs) in an isotonic medium. The degree of haemolytic (HL) activity of the purified cytolytic lectin depended on its concentration, pH, temperature, and calcium ions. It was sensitive to ethylenediaminetetraacetic . The native molecular mass of the C-type lectin was 260 ± 26 kDa, comprising four different polypeptide subunits of 75 kDa (pI ~8), 69 kDa (pI ~7.0), 61 kDa (pI ~5.3), and 55 kDa (pI ~4.6). The association between the C-type lectin and serine protease was confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis that revealed its homology in the same spectral peak as well as the proteases and phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride inhibition of HL activity.

We tested whether lizards would invest more in reproduction or  depending on reproductive stage. Females were given stable isotopes ( N-leucine and  C-1-palmitic ), maintained on a regular diet and given either a cutaneous biopsy or a sham biopsy (control). Stable isotopes were monitored and analyzed in feces and uric , skin biopsies, eggs, and toe clips. We found that lizards deposited both proteins and lipids into their healing wounds (immune-challenged), skin (control), and eggs (all) and that catabolism of proteins exceeded incorporation into tissue during wound-healing. Specifically, we found that healed biopsies of wounded animals had more leucine and palmitic  than the nonregrown skin biopsies taken from unwounded control animals. Earlier in reproduction, lizards invested relatively more labeled proteins into healing their wound tissue, but not into unwounded skin of control animals. Thus, reproduction is sometimes favored over self-maintenance, but only in later reproductive stages. Finally, we documented positive relationships among the amount of palmitic  deposited in the eggs, the amount of food eaten, and the amount of palmitic  excreted, suggesting higher turnover rates of lipids in lizards investing highly in their eggs.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678187>Chinese yam peel enhances the  of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) by improving the gut defence barrier and modulating the intestinal microflora.</a></h2><p>The Chinese yam peel (CYP) is a by-product of yam processing that is rich in various nutrients and a good source for feed additives.

Different groups of experimental fish were fed a normal control diet (NC), a low CYP diet (LYP) and a high CYP diet (HYP) for 8 weeks. After the feeding trial, the fish were assessed for intestinal enzyme activity, intestinal histology, immune-related gene expression, intestinal SCFAs and intestinal microbiota. Our results indicated that the intestinal integrity and antioxidant enzyme (CAT and SOD) activity in the common carp were enhanced following CYP supplementation. The mRNA levels of anti-inflammatory (TGF-β), tight binding protein (occludin and ZO-1) and pathway factor genes (TLR4 and NF-κB) were significantly upregulated in the HYP group (P＜0.05), which was accompanied by an increase in the level of pro-inflammatory IL-1β in the gut (P＜0.05). High-throughput sequencing revealed that Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes bacteria were most abundant in the microbial community in the gut of the common carp. The relative abundances of Bacteroides, Flavobacterium and Lactobacillus were increased, while the abundances of pathogenic microorganisms such as Enterobacteriaceae, Shewanella, Pseudomonas and Vibrio were reduced after treatment with CYP. Furthermore, the concentrations of acetic , propionic , butyric  and total short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) in the gut were also increased (P＜0.05).

To develop an effective yet simple process for enhancing its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, turmeric was gun-puffed at various pressures. Puffed turmeric exhibited an increase in its brown color and porous structures, indicating the occurrence of the Maillard reaction and vaporization during the process. Proximal analysis revealed that puffing did not alter the major constituents, although a very small decrease in crude fat extraction was observed under some circumstances. Total phenolic compounds in the extract were significantly increased after puffing, and subsequent assessment of antioxidant capacity, as determined using independent 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic ) (ABTS), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays, demonstrated enhanced antioxidant capacity in a puffing-pressure-dependent manner.

Despite a global research effort to understand and combat antimicrobial resistance, less work has focused on understanding the nuances in the immunopathogenesis of clinical strains. In particular, there is a surprising gap of knowledge in the literature pertaining to how clinical strains are recognized by dendritic cells (DCs). Here, we show that the activation of DCs is compromised in response to MRSA strains resistant to the last-line antibiotic daptomycin. We found a significant reduction in the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β, as well as decreased expression of CD80 by DCs responding to daptomycin-resistant MRSA. We further demonstrate that this phenotype is coincident with the acquisition of specific point mutations in the cardiolipin synthase gene cls2, and, partly, in the bifunctional lysylphosphatidylglycerol flippase/synthetase gene mprF, which are genes that are often mutated in clinical daptomycin-resistant strains. Therefore, throughout infection and antibiotic therapy, MRSA has the capacity to not only develop further antibiotic resistance, but also develop resistance to immunological recognition by DCs, because of single amino  point mutations occurring under the selective pressures of both host  and antibiotic therapy. Understanding the diversity of clinical MRSA isolates and the nuances in their immune recognition will have important implications for future therapeutics and the treatment of these infections.© 2019 Australian and New Zealand Society for Immunology Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646082>A poly-neoantigen DNA vaccine synergizes with PD-1 blockade to induce T cell-mediated tumor control.</a></h2><p>The combination of immune-stimulating strategies has the potency to improve immunotherapy of cancer. Vaccination against neoepitopes derived from patient tumor material can generate tumor-specific T cell , which could reinforce the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor therapies such as anti-PD-1 treatment. DNA vaccination is a versatile platform that allows the inclusion of multiple neoantigen-coding sequences in a single formulation and therefore represents an ideal platform for neoantigen vaccination. We developed an anti-tumor vaccine based on a synthetic DNA vector designed to contain multiple cancer-specific epitopes in tandem. The DNA vector encoded a fusion gene consisting of three neoepitopes derived from the mouse colorectal tumor MC38 and their natural flanking sequences as 40 amino  stretches. In addition, we incorporated as reporter epitopes the helper and CTL epitope sequences of ovalbumin. The poly-neoantigen DNA vaccine elicited T cell responses to all three neoantigens and induced functional CD8 and CD4 T cell responses to the reporter antigen ovalbumin after intradermal injection in mice. The DNA vaccine was effective in preventing outgrowth of B16 melanoma expressing ovalbumin in a prophylactic setting. Moreover, the combination of therapeutic DNA vaccination and anti-PD-1 treatment was synergistic in controlling MC38 tumor growth whereas individual treatments did not succeed. These data demonstrate the potential of DNA vaccination to target multiple neoepitopes in a single formulation and highlight the cooperation between vaccine-based and checkpoint blockade immunotherapies for the successful eradication of established tumors.© 2019 The Author(s).

Some of these released free fatty  are used to synthesize eicosanoids that mediate various physiological processes in insects. Although a large number of PLAs form a superfamily consisting of at least 16 groups, few PLAs have been identified and characterized in insects. Furthermore, physiological functions of insect PLAs remain unclear. Clustered regularly interspaced short parlindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) has been a useful research tool to validate gene function. This study identified and characterized a secretory PLA (sPLA) from legume pod borer, Maruca vitrata (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), and validated its physiological functions using CRISPR/Cas9. An open reading frame of M. vitrata sPLA (Mv-sPLA) encoding 192 amino  contained signal peptide, calcium-binding domain, and catalytic site. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Mv-sPLA was related to other Group III sPLAs. Mv-sPLA was expressed in both larval and adult stages. It was inducible by immune challenge. RNA interference (RNAi) of Mv-sPLA significantly suppressed cellular  and impaired larval development. Furthermore, RNAi treatment in female adults prevented oocyte development. These physiological alterations were also observed in a mutant line of M. vitrata with Mv-sPLA deleted by using CRISPR/Cas9. Mv-sPLA was not detected in the mutant line from western blot analysis.

We aimed in this study to define the reasons for their low distribution and the sequence of events accompanying their normal thymic development. We found that RORγt+ iNKT cells have higher proliferation potential and a greater propensity to apoptosis than RORγt- iNKT cells. These cells do not likely reside in the thymus indicating that thymus emigration, and higher apoptosis potential, could contribute to RORγt+ iNKT cell reduced thymic distribution. Ontogeny studies suggest that mature HSAlow RORγt+ iNKT cells might develop through developmental stages defined by a differential expression of CCR6 and CD138 during which RORγt expression and IL-17 production capabilities are progressively acquired. Finally, we found that RORγt+ iNKT cells perceive a strong TCR signal that could contribute to their entry into a specific "Th17 like" developmental program influencing their survival and migration. Overall, our study proposes a hypothetical thymic developmental sequence for iNKT17 cells, which could be of great use to study molecular mechanisms regulating this developmental program.© The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2019.

Dectin-2 recognizes high-mannose polysaccharides and plays a central role in the immune response to fungal pathogens. Previously, we demonstrated Dectin-2 was involved in the activation of dendritic cells upon stimulation with C. neoformans, suggesting the existence of a ligand recognized by Dectin-2. In the present study, we examined the cell wall structures of C. neoformans contributing to the Dectin-2- mediated activation of immune cells. In a NFAT-GFP reporter assay of the reported cells expressing Dectin-2, the lysates, but not the whole yeast cells, of an acapsular strain of C. neoformans (Cap67) delivered Dectin-2-mediated signaling. This activity was detected in the supernatant of β-glucanase-treated Cap67 and more strongly in the semi-purified polysaccharides of this supernatant using ConA-affinity chromatography (ConA-bound fraction), in which a large amount of saccharides, but not protein, were detected. Treatment of this supernatant with periodic  and the addition of excessive mannose, but not glucose or galactose, strongly inhibited this activity. The ConA-bound fraction of the β-glucanase-treated Cap67 supernatant was bound to Dectin-2-Fc fusion protein in a dose-dependent manner and strongly induced the production of IL-12p40 and TNF-α by dendritic cells; this was abrogated under the Dectin-2-deficient condition. Finally, 98 kDa mannoprotein (MP98) derived from C. neoformans showed activation of the reporter cells expressing Dectin-2. These results suggested that a ligand with mannose moieties may exist in the cell walls and play a critical role in the activation of dendritic cells during infection with C. neoformans.

Nevertheless, accumulating evidence has shown that tRNAs are closely related to various physiological and pathological processes. The proper functioning of the immune system is the key to human health. The aim of this review is to investigate the relationships between tRNAs and the immune system. We detail the biogenesis and structure of tRNAs and summarize the pathogen tRNA-mediated infection and host responses. In addition, we address recent advances in different aspects of tRNA-associated dysregulation in immune responses and immune diseases, such as tRNA molecules, tRNA modifications, tRNA derivatives and tRNA aminoacylation. Therefore, tRNAs play an important role in immune regulation. Although our knowledge of tRNAs in the context of  remains, for the most part, unknown, this field deserves in-depth research to provide new ideas for the treatment of immune diseases.© 2019 Scandinavian Physiological Society.

Four formulated diets were produced to contain 0.00 g/kg, 0.40 g/kg, 0.80 g/kg and 1.60 g/kg Actigen®, with functional ingredients of MOS, respectively. Accordingly, the experimental diets were named as A0, A4, A8 and A16. After 120-days feeding trial, the best growth performance was observed in A8 group (P < 0.05) and there was no significant difference in A0, A4 and A16 groups. With the increase of dietary MOS, the activity of the total antioxidant capacity in hepatopancreas is increasingly elevated (P < 0.05) while no significant difference was observed on activity of glutathione S-transferase (P > 0.05). The activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were firstly increased and then decreased, with the highest values in A8 group (P < 0.05). Immune-related parameters were significantly affected by dietary MOS inclusion. Specifically, the activities of alkaline phosphatase and  phosphatase in hepatopancreas and serum of abalone fed diets containing MOS were significantly higher than those of control A0 group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the highest values of both enzymes were observed in hepatopancreas of A8 group but in serum of A16 group, respectively. The lysozyme activities in hepatopancreas and serum of A4 group were significantly higher than those of other groups (P < 0.05) and there was no significant difference in A0, A8 and A16 groups (P > 0.05). The activities of cytophagy and respiratory burst in serum of abalone were not significantly affected by dietary MOS content (P > 0.05). The mRNA levels of focal adhesion kinase and integrin-linked kinase were gradually elevated with the increase of dietary MOS, with the highest value recorded in A16 group (P < 0.05). The gene expression of caspse-3 in A8 group was dramatically higher than those of other groups (P < 0.05) and there was no significant difference in A0, A4 and A16 groups (P > 0.05). The mRNA level of nuclear factor-κB was not significantly affected by dietary MOS (P > 0.05). During 56 h of V. Parahemolyticus challenge period, the accumulated mortality rate of abalone fed diets containing MOS were significantly lower than that of control A0 group in each time point (P < 0.05). Overall, the lowest rate was happened in A8 group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, MOS inclusion in diet has obviously positive effect on growth,  and disease resistance capability of abalone, with the optimal level of Actigen® at 0.80 g/kg in diet.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, an APV virus (SD18 strain) was isolated from a diseased psittacine birds breeding facility. The full genome (4981 bp) of SD18 was determined and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis of full genome sequences indicated all the APV strains form two groups. The SD18 strain showed close relationship with APV isolated from Poland, however, the other Chinese strains are located in group II, which suggested different genotypes APVs are co-circulating in China. Compared with the consensus sequence of APV full genome, the SD18 strain contains 13 nucleotide mutations, and 2 unique amino  substitutions (R179M and Q382K) located in VP2/3 and Large T proteins. To explore the pathogenicity of the virus, the SD18 strain was used to challenge 2-week-old budgerigars. All infected birds died no later than 5 days post infection, and virus was detected in multiple organs including brain, heart, ingluvies, liver, and intestine, which indicated that SD18 is fatal and causes systemic infection in young budgerigar. In vitro studies showed that SD18 replicated efficiently in CEF cells and reached the highest viral titers at 9 days post infection. Notably, replication of SD18 stimulated IFN-β response in CEF cells and overexpression of the VP4 or VP4Delta proteins significantly inhibited IFN-β promoter activation, which could be the strategy of APV to escape from the host innate .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Better treatment options for leukemia are required due to large number of side effects associated with current therapeutic regimens. In the present study, we sought to determine the pathway of triggering apoptosis of leukemic cells by Ocimum basilicum plant extract. <P> Materials/Methods: Methanolic extract of the plant material was prepared. Crude extract was fractionated into several fractions through column chromatography using ethyl acetate and n-hexane as eluting solvents. Cell viability of leukemic cells was assessed via Cell titer GLO assay and apoptosis was measured through Annexin V/PI staining. Major Apoptotic markers JNK and Caspases were analyzed through western blotting while pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, CCL2 and CXCL8 using qPCR. Fractions were characterized through LC-MS. <P> Results: The most potent with lowest IC50 values among the fractions were B2 and B3. Cytotoxicity was associated with apoptosis. Apoptosis was found caspase dependent and P-JNK activation was detected sustained. Significant increase in the level of TNF α and decrease in the level of CXCL8 was observed in B2 and B3 fractions treated cells. <P> Conclusion: The fractions of O. basilicum extract were found to kill cells following JNK pathway activation. The excellent results were obtained with B2 and B3 fractions probably due to predominantly Epicatechin and Cinnamic  derivatives in these fractions.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547425>d-amino  in Health and Disease: A Focus on Cancer.</a></h2><p>d-amino , the enantiomeric counterparts of l-amino , were long considered to be non-functional or not even present in living organisms.

The  proteins for two-peptide bacteriocins contain putative transmembrane domains (TMDs) and might therefore be associated with the membrane.

TLR4 is a membrane-bound highly sialylated glycoprotein predominantly having α2,3-linked sialic . It is one of the most important client molecules in the anti-leishmanial innate immune arm. Here, we initiated a comprehensive study on the modulation of TLR4 sialylation in  ()-infected macrophages by a mammalian sialidase/neuraminidase-1 (Neu1) having substrate specificity toward α2,3-linked sialic . We observed reduced membrane-associated Neu1 with its decreased enzyme activity in infected macrophages. Moreover, we demonstrated reduced association of Neu1 with TLR4 leading to enhanced sialylation of TLR4 in these infected cells. Conversely, Neu1 over expression exhibited enhanced association of TLR4 with Neu1 leading to reduced sialylation which possibly linked to increased association of TLR4 with its downstream adaptor protein, MyD88. This, in turn, activated downstream MAP kinase signaling pathway, with enhanced nuclear translocation of NFκB that resulted in increased genetic and protein levels expression of Th1 cytokines and effector molecule nitric oxide secretion which ultimately leads to reduced parasite burden in macrophages. This was further validated by Neu1 silencing in infected macrophages which reversed such a situation. Such events strongly confirm the importance of Neu1 in modulation of TLR4 sialylation during parasite infection resulting in impairment of innate immune response. Furthermore, decreased membrane-bound Neu1 in infected macrophages could be attributed to its reduced tyrosine-phosphorylation as well as diminished association with cathepsin A. Both these phenomenon possibly play significant roles in inhibiting translocation of the sialidase from cytosol to membrane. Taken together, our study first time demonstrated impaired translocation of cytosolic Neu1 to the membrane of -infected macrophages due to impaired phosphorylation of this enzyme. This novel finding establishes a link between enhanced α2,3-linked sialic  on TLR4 and reduced membrane-bound Neu1 which plays a significant role for inhibiting downstream signaling to establish successful infection in the host cells.Copyright © 2019 Karmakar, Roy and Mandal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680316>Vascular Bundle Sheath And Mesophyll Cells Modulate Leaf Water Balance In Response To Chitin.</a></h2><p>Plants can detect pathogen invasion by sensing Microbe-Associated Molecular Patterns (MAMPs). This sensing process leads to the induction of defense responses. Numerous MAMP mechanisms of action have been described in and outside the guard cells. Here, we describe the effects of chitin, a MAMP found in fungal cell walls and insects, on the cellular osmotic water permeability (P ) of the leaf vascular bundle-sheath (BS) and mesophyll cells (MCs), and its subsequent effect on leaf hydraulic conductance (K ). BS is a parenchymatic tissue that tightly encases the vascular system. BS cells (BSCs) have been shown to influence K through changes in their P , for example, after sensing the abiotic stress response-regulating hormone abscisic  (ABA). It was recently reported that, in Arabidopsis, the chitin receptors-like kinases, chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 (CERK1) and LYSINE MOTIF RECEPTOR KINASE 5 (LYK5) are highly expressed in the BS as well as the neighboring mesophyll. Therefore, we studied the possible impact of chitin on these cells. Our results revealed that BSCs and MCs exhibit a sharp decrease in P in response to chitin treatment. In addition, xylem-fed chitin decreased K and led to stomatal closure. However, Atlyk5 mutant showed none of these responses. Complementing AtLYK5 in the BSCs (using the SCARECROW promoter) resulted in the response to chitin that was similar to that observed in the wild type. These results suggest that BS play a role in the perception of apoplastic chitin and in initiating chitin-triggered .© 2019 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668641>Amino  License Kinase mTORC1 Activity and Treg Cell Function via Small G Proteins Rag and Rheb.</a></h2><p>Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical mediators of immune tolerance whose activity depends upon T cell receptor (TCR) and mTORC1 kinase signaling, but the mechanisms that dictate functional activation of these pathways are incompletely understood. Here, we showed that amino  license Treg cell function by priming and sustaining TCR-induced mTORC1 activity. mTORC1 activation was induced by amino , especially arginine and leucine, accompanied by the dynamic lysosomal localization of the mTOR and Tsc complexes. Rag and Rheb GTPases were central regulators of amino -dependent mTORC1 activation in effector Treg (eTreg) cells. Mice bearing RagA-RagB- or Rheb1-Rheb2-deficient Treg cells developed a fatal autoimmune disease and had reduced eTreg cell accumulation and function. RagA-RagB regulated mitochondrial and lysosomal fitness, while Rheb1-Rheb2 enforced eTreg cell suppressive gene signature. Together, these findings reveal a crucial requirement of amino  signaling for licensing and sustaining mTORC1 activation and functional programming of Treg cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, there are substantial variations in the cell surface expression levels of human TCRs, which can impair the function of engineered T cells. Here we demonstrate that substitutions of 3 amino  residues in the framework of the TCR variable domains consistently increase the expression of human TCRs on the surface of engineered T cells.The modified TCRs mediate enhanced T cell proliferation, cytokine production and cytotoxicity, while reducing the peptide concentration required for triggering effector function up to 3000-fold. Adoptive transfer experiments in mice show that modified TCRs control tumor growth more efficiently than wild-type TCRs.

It weakens the immune system by targeting the T-helper cells. Specifically, the severity of the pandemic HIV-1 makes the emergence of an enduring effective vaccine against HIV-1. Therefore, we have applied a series of immunoinformatics approaches to the four conserved domains of HIV-1 integrase (IN) proteins to design an effective multi-epitope based subunit vaccine which might induce a competent  against HIV-1. Therefore, we have selected three peptide fragments that contained all overlapping epitopes (35 CD4, 8 CD8 T-cell epitopes, and 3 B-cell epitopes) where the epitopes had a high conservancy score. The cumulative population coverage for combined CD8 and CD4 T-cell epitopes and their respective HLA-alleles were found as 98.03% in the world which is also followed by East Asia (96.24%), South Asia (96.31%), North Africa (96.14%), North America (98.99%), and Europe (98.80%). The proposed vaccine composed by an adjuvant (β-defensin) at the N-terminal site of the vaccine constructs and three peptide fragments where the adjuvant was fused by EAAAK linker and the peptide fragments were fused by GPGPG linker. The designed final vaccine construct (length: 159 amino ) was found to be antigenic and non-allergic, which indicates its safety. The vaccine construct was found as good antigenic, stable, higher thermostable, and hydrophilic in nature. The codon adaptation and in silico cloning ensured the high expression rate of the vaccine constructs in E. coli K12 with CAI value of 1.0. Finally, the binding affinity of the vaccine constructs with the immune receptor TLR3 was confirmed by the lowest energy score of -1026.8 evaluated by molecular docking. However, the proposed in silico vaccine construct needs experimental validation for assuring the safety and immunogenicity profile which will ensure an active  against HIV-1.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was to determine the miRNA profile in colostrum of overconditioned cows compared with cows of more moderate body condition score (BCS) at calving. Multiparous cows with either high (≥4.0 on a scale of 1 to 5; n = 7) or moderate BCS (2.75 to 3.50; n = 9) in the week before parturition were selected from a commercial dairy herd. Blood and colostrum were sampled within 24 h after calving. Blood serum was analyzed for free fatty  (FFA) concentration. MicroRNA was isolated from colostrum samples after removing milk fat and cells. MicroRNA were sequenced, and reads were mapped to the bovine genome and to the existing database of miRNA at miRBase.org. Two programs, Oasis 2.0 and miRDeep2, were employed in parallel for read alignment, and analysis of miRNA count data was performed using DESeq2. Identification of differentially expressed miRNA from DESeq2 was not affected by the differences in miRNA detected by the 2 mapping programs. Most abundant miRNA included miR-30a, miR-148a, miR-181a, let-7f, miR-26a, miR-21, miR-22, and miR-92a. Large-scale shifts in miRNA profile were not observed; however, colostrum of cows with high BCS contained less miR-486, which has been linked with altered glucose metabolism. Colostrum from cows with elevated serum FFA contained less miR-885, which may be connected to hepatic function during the transition period. Potential functions of abundant miRNA suggest involvement in development and maintenance of cellular function in the mammary gland, with the additional possibility of influencing neonatal tissue and immune system development.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The mechanism of T cell dysfunction in TB is still not clear. In this study we set up a mouse model of T cell dysfunction by persistent  antigen stimulation and investigated the therapeutic role of interleukin 2 (IL-2) in it. C57BL/6 mice were primed with  Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and boosted repeatedly with a combination of  fusion proteins Mtb10.4-HspX (MH) plus ESAT6-Ag85B-MPT64 -Mtb8.4-Rv2626c (LT70) or MH plus ESAT6 and CFP10 with adjuvant of N, N'-dimethyl-N, N'-dioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA) plus polyinosinic-polycytidylic  (Poly I:C).

However, the absence of antigen markers is a bottleneck for developing effective vaccines against fish nocardiosis. In this study, the antigenicity of whole-cell protein of these three pathogenic Nocardia species were profiled by immunoproteomic analysis and 7 common immunogenic proteins were identified as follows: molecular chaperone DnaK (DnaK), molecular chaperone GroEL (GroEL), 30S ribosomal protein S1 (RpsA), TerD family protein (TerD), FHA domain-containing protein (FHA), 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 (RplL) and PspA/IM30 family protein (PspA). Furthermore, the DNA vaccine encoding FHA gene against fish nocardiosis was developed and its efficacy was investigated in hybrid snakehead.

CF is manifested by abnormal accumulation of mucus in the lungs, which serves as fertile ground for the growth of microorganisms leading to recurrent infections and ultimately, lung failure. Mucus in CF patients consists of DNA from dead neutrophils as well as mucins produced by goblet cells. MUC5AC mucin leads to pathological plugging of the airways whereas MUC5B has a protective role against bacterial infection. Therefore, decreasing the level of MUC5AC while maintaining MUC5B intact would in principle be a desirable mucoregulatory treatment outcome. Fenretinide prevented the lipopolysaccharide-induced increase of MUC5AC gene expression, without affecting the level of MUC5B, in a lung goblet cell line. Additionally, fenretinide treatment reversed the pro-inflammatory imbalance of fatty  by increasing docosahexaenoic  and decreasing the levels of arachidonic  in a lung epithelial cell line and primary leukocytes derived from CF patients. Furthermore, for the first time we also demonstrate the effect of fenretinide on multiple unsaturated fatty , as well as differential effects on the levels of long- compared to very-long-chain saturated fatty  which are important substrates of complex phospholipids. Finally, we demonstrate that pre-treating mice with fenretinide in a chronic model of P. aeruginosa lung infection efficiently decreases the accumulation of mucus.

Accumulating evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles, among other functions, regulate innate and adaptive immune responses. We revisit here the effects that extracellular vesicles of various origins have on innate .Extracellular vesicles comprise a heterogeneous group of vesicles with different biogenesis, composition and biological properties, which include exosomes, microvesicles, apoptotic cell-derived extracellular vesicles, and other extracellular vesicles still not well characterized. Extracellular vesicles released by pathogens, leukocytes, nonhematopoietic cells, tumor cells, and likely allografts, can either stimulate or suppress innate  via multiple mechanisms. These include transfer to target leukocytes of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory mediators, membrane receptors, enzymes, mRNAs, and noncoding RNAs; and interaction of extracellular vesicles with the complement and coagulation systems. As a result, extracellular vesicles affect differentiation, polarization, activation, tissue recruitment, cytokine and chemokine production, cytolytic and phagocytic function, and antigen transfer ability, of different types of innate immune cells.The field of intercellular communication via extracellular vesicles is a rapid evolving area and the effects of pathogen-derived and host-derived extracellular vesicles on innate  in particular, have received increasing attention during the past decade.

A critical challenge in using the ICD inducers in cancer immunotherapy is the immunotoxicity accompanying their antiproliferative effects. To alleviate this, a nanocapsule formulation of carfilzomib (CFZ), an ICD-inducing proteasome inhibitor, was developed using interfacial supramolecular assembly of tannic  (TA) and iron, supplemented with albumin coating. The albumin-coated CFZ nanocapsules (CFZ-pTA-alb) attenuated CFZ release, reducing toxicity to immune cells. Moreover, due to the adhesive nature of the TA assembly, CFZ-pTA-alb served as a reservoir of damage-associated molecular patterns released from dying tumor cells to activate dendritic cells. Upon intratumoral administration, CFZ-pTA-alb prolonged tumor retention of CFZ and showed consistently greater antitumor effects than cyclodextrin-solubilized CFZ (CFZ-CD) in B16F10 and CT26 tumor models. Unlike CFZ-CD, the locally injected CFZ-pTA-alb protected or enhanced CD8 T cell population in tumors, helped develop splenocytes with tumor-specific interferon-γ response, and delayed tumor development on the contralateral side in immunocompetent mice (but not in athymic nude mice), supporting that CFZ-pTA-alb contributed to activating antitumor . This study demonstrates that sustained delivery of ICD inducers by TA-based nanocapsules is an effective way of translating local ICD induction to systemic antitumor .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583464>Selection of miRNA reference genes for plant defence studies in rice (Oryza sativa).</a></h2><p>MicroRNAs miR390-5p, miR7694-3p miR1868 and miR1849 were found to be suitable miRNA reference genes for rice, under either infection with the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne graminicola or treatment with BABA. RT-qPCR is a widely used method to investigate the expression levels of genes under certain conditions. A key step, however, to have reliable results is the normalization of expression. For every experimental condition, suitable reference genes must be chosen. These reference genes must not be affected by differences in experimental conditions. MicroRNAs are regulatory RNA molecules, able to direct the expression levels of protein coding genes. In plants, their attributed functions range from roles in development to . In this work, microRNAs (miRNAs) are evaluated for their suitability as reference genes in rice after infection with root-knot nematode Meloidogyne graminicola or after priming with beta-amino butyric . The evaluation was based on their amplification efficiency and their stability estimates according to geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. All tested miRNAs, excluding one, were considered acceptable for normalization. Furthermore, miRNAs were validated using miRNA sequencing data. The set of microRNAs miR390-5p and miR7694-3p was found to be the most stable combination under the tested conditions. Another miRNA set consisting of miR7694-3p, miR1868 and miR1849 also shows potential to be used for miRNA expression normalization under experimental conditions beyond the scope of this study.

Fasciolosis causes a significant economic impact on the agricultural sector and affects human health. Due to the increasing prevalence of triclabendazole resistance in F. hepatica, alternative treatment methods are required. Many protein antigens have been trialled as vaccine candidates with low success, however, the tegument of F. hepatica is highly glycosylated and the parasite-derived glycoconjugate molecules have been identified as an important mediator in host-parasite interactions and as prime targets for the host immune system. Galectin-11 (LGALS-11) and galectin-14 (LGALS-14) are two ruminant-specific glycan-binding proteins, showing upregulation in the bile duct of sheep infected with F. hepatica, which are believed to mediate host-parasite interaction and innate  against internal parasites. For the first known time, this study presents the ligand profile of whole worm and tegument extracts of F. hepatica that interacted with immobilised LGALS-11 and LGALS-14. LGALS-14 interacted with a total of 255 F. hepatica proteins. The protein which had the greatest interaction was identified as an uncharacterised protein which contained a C-type lectin domain. Many of the other proteins identified were previously trialled vaccine candidates including glutathione S-transferase, paramyosin, cathepsin L, cathepsin B, fatty  binding protein and leucine aminopeptidase. In comparison to LGALS-14, LGALS-11 interacted with only 49 F. hepatica proteins and it appears to have a much smaller number of binding partners in F. hepatica. This is, to our knowledge, the first time host-specific lectins have been used for the enrichment of F. hepatica glycoproteins and this study has identified a number of glycoproteins that play critical roles in host-parasite interactions which have the potential to be novel vaccine candidates.Copyright © 2019 Australian Society for Parasitology.

The nature of the host immune response dictates whether the initial Mtb infection is cleared or progresses toward active disease, and is ultimately determined by intricate host-pathogen interactions that are yet to be fully understood. The early immune response to infection is mediated by innate immune cells, including macrophages and neutrophils that can phagocytose Mtb and mount an antimicrobial response. However, Mtb can exploit these innate immune cells for its survival and dissemination. Recently, it has become clear that the immune response and metabolic remodeling are interconnected, which is highlighted by the rapid evolution of the interdisciplinary field of immunometabolism. It has been proposed that the net outcome to Mtb infection-clearance or chronic disease-is likely a result of combined immunologic and metabolic activities of the immune cells. Indeed, host cells activated by Mtb infection have strikingly different metabolic requirements than naïve/non-infected cells. Macrophages activated by Mtb-derived molecules or upon phagocytosis acquire a phenotype similar to M1 with elevated production of pro-inflammatory molecules and rely on glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway to meet their bioenergetic and metabolic requirements. In these macrophages, oxidative phosphorylation and fatty  oxidation are dampened. However, the non-infected/naive, M2-type macrophages are anti-inflammatory and derive their energy from oxidative phosphorylation and fatty  oxidation. Similar metabolic adaptations also occur in other phagocytes, including dendritic cells, neutrophils upon Mtb infection. This metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells during Mtb infection can differentially regulate their effector functions, such as the production of cytokines and chemokines, and antimicrobial response, all of which can ultimately determine the outcome of Mtb-host interactions within the granulomas. In this review, we describe key immune cells bolstering host innate response and discuss the metabolic reprogramming in these phagocytes during Mtb infection. We focused on the major phagocytes, including macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils and the key regulators involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1, mammalian target of rapamycin, the cellular myelocytomatosis, peroxisome proliferator-activator receptors, sirtuins, arginases, inducible nitric  synthase and sphingolipids.Copyright © 2019 Kumar, Singh, Kolloli, Shi, Bushkin, Tyagi and Subbian.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653831>Dietary tryptophan links encephalogenicity of autoreactive T cells with gut microbial ecology.</a></h2><p>The interaction between the mammalian host and its resident gut microbiota is known to license adaptive immune responses. Nutritional constituents strongly influence composition and functional properties of the intestinal microbial communities. Here, we report that omission of a single essential amino  - tryptophan - from the diet abrogates CNS autoimmunity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Dietary tryptophan restriction results in impaired encephalitogenic T cell responses and is accompanied by a mild intestinal inflammatory response and a profound phenotypic shift of gut microbiota. Protective effects of dietary tryptophan restriction are abrogated in germ-free mice, but are independent of canonical host sensors of intracellular tryptophan metabolites. We conclude that dietary tryptophan restriction alters metabolic properties of gut microbiota, which in turn have an impact on encephalitogenic T cell responses. This link between gut microbiota, dietary tryptophan and adaptive  may help to develop therapeutic strategies for protection from autoimmune neuroinflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616439>Interleukin-22 Attenuated Renal Tubular Injury in Aristolochic  Nephropathy via Suppressing Activation of NLRP3 Inflammasome.</a></h2><p>Aristolochic  nephropathy (AAN), as a rapidly progressive interstitial nephropathy due to excessive ingestion of aristolochia herbal medications, has recently raised considerable concerns among clinicians and researchers as its underlying pathogenic mechanisms are largely unclear. In the current study, we identified NLRP3 inflammasome activation as a novel pathological mechanism of AAN. We found that NLRP3 inflammasome was aberrantly activated both  and  after AA exposure. Blockade of IL-1β and NLRP3 inflammasome activation by IL-1Ra significantly attenuated renal tubular injury and function loss in AA-induced nephropathy. Moreover, NLRP3 or Caspase-1 deficiency protected against renal injury in the mouse model of acute AAN, suggesting that the NLRP3 signaling pathway was probably involved in the pathogenesis of AAN. We also found that administration of IL-22 could markedly attenuate renal tubular injury in AAN. Notably, IL-22 intervention significantly alleviated renal fibrosis and dysfunction in AA-induced nephropathy. Furthermore, IL-22 largely inhibited renal activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in AA-induced nephropathy. These results indicated that IL-22 ameliorated renal tubular injury in AAN through suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In summary, this study identified renal activation of NLRP3 inflammasome as a novel mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of AAN, thus providing a potential therapeutic strategy for AAN based on suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.Copyright © 2019 Wang, Fan, Mei, Luan, Li, Zhang, Chen, Wang, Meng and Ju.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624845>CRISPRCasdb a successor of CRISPRdb containing CRISPR arrays and cas genes from complete genome sequences, and tools to download and query lists of repeats and spacers.</a></h2><p>In Archaea and Bacteria, the arrays called CRISPRs for 'clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats' and the CRISPR associated genes or cas provide adaptive  against viruses, plasmids and transposable elements. Short sequences called spacers, corresponding to fragments of invading DNA, are stored in-between repeated sequences.

Recent years have shown increased interest in using lactobacilli for delivery of vaccines, mainly due to their ability to skew the immune system towards pro-inflammatory responses. We have compared the potential of eight Lactobacillus species, L. plantarum, L. brevis, L. curvatus, L. rhamnosus, L. sakei, L. gasseri, L. acidophilus and L. reuteri, as immunogenic carriers of the Ag85B-ESAT-6 antigen from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Surface-display of the antigen was achieved in L. plantarum, L. brevis, L. gasseri and L. reuteri and these strains were further analyzed in terms of their in vitro and in vivo immunogenicity. All strains activated human dendritic cells in vitro. Immunization of mice using a homologous prime-boost regimen comprising a primary subcutaneous immunization followed by three intranasal boosters, led to slightly elevated IgG levels in serum in most strains, and, importantly, to significantly increased levels of antigen-specific mucosal IgA. Cellular  was assessed by studying antigen-specific T cell responses in splenocytes, which did not reveal proliferation as assessed by the expression of Ki67, but which showed clear antigen-specific IFN-γ and IL-17 responses for some of the groups. Taken together, the present results indicate that L. plantarum and L. brevis are the most promising carriers of TB vaccines.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

In this study, we aim to investigate if POR is associated with serum 25(OH) vitamin D (VD) levels and pro-inflammatory immune responses in infertile women with a history of in-vitro fertilization and embryo transfer failures. A retrospective cross-sectional study included 157 women with IVF failures. Study patients were divided into four groups based on serum 25(OH)VD level and ovarian responses during the most recent IVF cycle; low VD (LVD) with POR, LVD with normal ovarian response (NOR), normal VD (NVD) with POR, and NVD with NOR. Serum 25(OH)VD level, cellular- and auto-, and metabolic parameters, including homocysteine and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were investigated. Peripheral blood CD56 NK cell levels (%) and NK cytotoxicity were significantly higher in POR-LVD when compared to the other groups (P < 0.05, respectively). CD19 + B and CD19+/5+ B-1 cell levels were significantly higher in women with POR-LVD as compared with those of NOR-LVD and POR-NVD (P < 0.05, respectively). TNF-α/IL-10 producing Th1/Th2 cell ratio of POR-LVD was significantly higher than those of POR-NVD and NOR-NVD (P < 0.05 respectively). Peripheral blood homocysteine level of POR-LVD was significantly higher than those of NOR-LVD and POR-NVD (P < 0.05 respectively). We conclude that assessment of cellular and autoimmune abnormalities and metabolic factors, such as homocysteine should be considered in women with POR and LVD.

However, little is known about the biological behaviors of Rig-I devoid of viral infection. Herein, we investigated the roles of Rig-I in the regulation of cellular senescence. In comparison to wild-type counterparts,  mice displayed the accelerated loss of hair, less responsiveness to gentle physical stimuli and shorten survival time. Likewise, Rig-I deficiency rendered mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) more susceptible to the serial passages-associated replicative senescence. By performing a transcriptome analysis, we identified integrins at the intersections of biological pathways affected by Rig-I. Among these, integrin β3 was negatively regulated by Rig-I, and significantly upregulated with the occurrence of senescence. Gene silencing of Itgb3 (encoding integrin β3) retarded the progression of cellular senescence in both WT and  MEFs. Notably, this effect was more prominent in  MEFs. Furthermore, p38 MAPK was a key downstream molecule for integrin β3-mediated senescence, and overactivated in senescent  MEFs. Taken together, Rig-I deficiency contributes to cellular senescence through amplifying integrin β3/p38 MAPK signaling. Our findings provide the evidence that Rig-I is a key regulator of cellular senescence, which will be helpful in better understanding its function without viral infection.

Since 2004, lineage 2 WNV strains have been identified in Europe and have been implicated in severe outbreaks, with that of 2018 exceeding the total number from the previous seven years. The aim of this study was to explore the evolutionary process that shapes the genetic diversity of lineage 2 WNV strains (belonging to the Central European/Hungarian subclade) and reconstruct the origin and transmission routes in Europe, and especially in the Balkans. For this purpose, a high number of whole genome sequences (WGSs) were analyzed, along with newly characterized sequences, including strains from the 2018 WNV transmission season in Greece. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods were used to perform the phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses and phylogeographic reconstruction. The majority of the Central European/Hungarian lineage 2 strains are grouped in 2 phylogenetic subgroups (Central/South-West European and Balkan) with bush-like topology. Purifying selection shapes their evolution, however, strong evidence of positive selection was revealed in 7 non-structural protein codons of NS1, NS4B and NS5. Thirty-two amino- substitutions were fixed in different phylogenetic subgroups, indicating that random genetic drift is responsible for the majority of evolutionary changes. Virus migration, followed by subsequent local evolution is responsible for continuously evolving strains throughout Europe. In total, 10 virus transitions between discrete geographical locations, involving virus spread from Central Europe to other regions, were highly supported. Three novel, independent introductions from Hungary and Bulgaria were responsible for the 2018 re-emergence of WNV in Northern Greece, indicating that Hungary remains an important ecological niche for the virus and has a central role for the dissemination of novel strains in the Balkans. In Northern Greece, tMRCA estimations indicated that a 1-to 2-year period of silent enzootic transmission precedes spread to dead-end hosts. Reconstruction of WNV population dynamics, from WGS data, revealed epidemic patterns characterized by 3- to 5-year oscillations in Europe. Future studies are necessary to determine the possible driving factors for these fluctuations i.e. avian herd  and climatic conditions affecting mosquito and bird populations. Maintaining adequate epidemiological surveillance with emphasis on obtaining WGS data, in areas at risk, is crucial for understanding the epidemiology and transmission patterns of WNV. It can further support integrated programs for risk assessment of virus circulation dynamics, aiming to targeted prevention and response measures for veterinary and public health in Europe.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here we identify serine 80 (S80) as a phosphorylation site on the p50 subunit of NF-κB, and IKKβ as a p50 kinase. Transcriptomic analysis of cells expressing a p50 S80A mutant reveals a critical role for S80 in selectively regulating the TNFα inducible expression of a subset of NF-κB target genes including pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. S80 phosphorylation regulates the binding of p50 to NF-κB binding (κB) sites in a sequence specific manner. Specifically, phosphorylation of S80 reduces the binding of p50 at κB sites with an adenine at the -1 position. Our analyses demonstrate that p50 S80 phosphorylation predominantly regulates transcription through the p50:p65 heterodimer, where S80 phosphorylation acts in trans to limit the NF-κB mediated transcription of pro-inflammatory genes. The regulation of a functional class of pro-inflammatory genes by the interaction of S80 phosphorylated p50 with a specific κB sequence describes a novel mechanism for the control of cytokine-induced transcriptional responses.© The Author(s) 2019.

In the present study, Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) were fed with fenofibrate, an agonist of PPARα, for six weeks, and subsequently challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila. The results showed that PPARα was efficiently activated by fenofibrate through increasing mRNA and protein expressions and protein dephosphorylation. PPARα activation increased significantly mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation efficiency, the copy number of mitochondrial DNA and expression of monoamine oxidase (MAO), a marker gene of mitochondria. Meanwhile, PPARα activation also increased significantly the expression of NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1α subcomplex subunit 9 (NDUFA9, complex I) and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (MTCO1, complex IV). The fenofibrate-fed fish had higher survival rate when exposed to A. hydrophila. Moreover, the fenofibrate-fed fish also had higher activities of immune and antioxidative enzymes, and gene expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines, while had lower expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes.

Substantial changes in host hormones, metabolism, and  around the parturition period may be accompanied by alterations in the gut microbiome. However, to our knowledge, changes in the gut microbiome and their contribution to the shifts in host metabolism around parturition have not been investigated in pigs. Furthermore, pigs are an ideal biomedical model for studying the interactions of the gut microbiota with host metabolism, due to the ease of controlling feeding conditions. Here we report dramatic remodeling of the gut microbiota and the potential functional capacity during the late stages of pregnancy (5 days before parturition, LP) to postpartum (within 6 h after delivery, PO) in both experimental and validated populations of sows ( = 107). The richness of bacteria in the gut of both pregnant and delivery sows significantly decreased, whilst the β-diversity dramatically expanded. The ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes, and the relative abundance of Prevotella significantly decreased, whilst the relative abundance of the predominant genus  significantly increased from LP to PO state. The predicted functional capacities of the gut microbiome related to amino  metabolism, the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, and glycan biosynthesis were significantly decreased from LP to PO state. However, the abundance of the functional capacities associated with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were increased. Consistent with these changes, serum metabolites enriched at the LP stage were associated with the metabolism of amino  and vitamins. In contrast, metabolites enriched at the PO stage were related to lipid metabolism. We further identified that the richness and β-diversity of the gut microbiota and the abundance of  accounted for shifts in the levels of bile  metabolites associated with lipid metabolism. The results suggest that host-microbiota interactions during the perinatal period impact host metabolism.

Further studies and reviews are needed regarding the effects of glutamine supplementation on other conditions in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611352>Novel plasmid-mediated (X5) gene conferring resistance to tigecycline, eravacycline and omadacycline in clinical .</a></h2><p>A novel, plasmid-mediated, high-level tigecycline resistance (X) gene variant, (X5), was detected in a clinical  isolate from China in 2017.

For instance, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is reduced during protein malnutrition and is known to be modulated by concentrations of several amino  when in a multiprotein signaling complex that contains regulatory-associated protein of mTOR. We hypothesized that a partial decrease in mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity intrinsic to B-lineage cells would perturb lymphocyte development or function, or both. We show that a cell-intrinsic decrease in mTORC1 activity impacted developmental progression, antigen receptor repertoire, and function along the B lineage. Thus, preimmune repertoires of B-lineage cells were altered in the marrow and periphery in a genetic model of regulatory-associated protein of mTOR haplo-insufficiency. An additional role for mTORC1 was revealed when a B-cell antigen receptor transgene was found to circumvent the abnormal B-cell development: haplo-insufficient B cells were profoundly impaired in responses to antigen . Collectively, our findings indicate that mTORC1 serves as a rheostat that shapes differentiation along the B lineage, the preimmune repertoire, and antigen-driven selection of mature B cells. The findings also reveal a range in the impact of this nutrient sensor on activity-response relationships for distinct endpoints.-Raybuck, A. L., Lee, K., Cho, S. H., Li, J., Thomas, J.

As a result, effective anti-inflammatory drugs have been widely used to reduce pain and inflammation which target key eicosanoid biosynthesis enzymes. Conserved from vertebrates to insects, the use of these eicosanoid pathway inhibitors offer opportunities to evaluate the roles of eicosanoids in less-characterized insect systems. In this study, we examine the potential roles of eicosanoids on malaria parasite survival in the mosquito  Using  oocyst numbers to evaluate parasite infection, general or specific inhibitors of eicosanoid biosynthesis pathways were evaluated. Following the administration of dexamethasone and indomethacin, respective inhibitors of phospholipid A2 (PLA2) and cyclooxygenase (COX), oocyst numbers were unaffected. However, inhibition of lipoxygenase (LOX) activity through the use of esculetin significantly increased oocyst survival. In contrast, 12-[[(tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]dec-1-ylamino)carbonyl]amino]-dodecanoic  (AUDA), an inhibitor of epoxide hydroxylase (EH), decreased oocyst numbers. These experiments were further validated through RNAi experiments to silence candidate genes homologous to EH in An. gambiae to confirm their contributions to Plasmodium development. Similar to the results of AUDA treatment, the silencing of EH significantly reduced oocyst numbers. These results imply that specific eicosanoids in An. gambiae can have either agonist or antagonistic roles on malaria parasite survival in the mosquito host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535317>Distinct evolution of toll-like receptor signaling pathway genes in cetaceans.</a></h2><p>The relatively rapid spread and diversity of marine pathogens posed an initial and ongoing challenge for cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), descendants of terrestrial mammals that transitioned from land to sea approximately 56 million years ago. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play important roles in regulating  against pathogen infections by detecting specific molecular patterns and activating a wide range of downstream signaling pathways. The ever-increasing catalogue of mammalian genomes offers unprecedented opportunities to reveal genetic changes associated with evolutionary and ecological processes.This study aimed to explore the molecular evolution of TLR signaling pathway genes in cetaceans.Genes involved in the TLR signaling pathway were retrieved by BLAST searches using human coding sequences as queries. We tested each gene for positive selection along the cetacean branches using PAML and Hyphy. Physicochemical property changes of amino  at all positively selected residues were assessed by TreeSAAP and visualized with WebLogo. Bovine and dolphin TLR4 was assessed using human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293, which lacks TLR4 and its co-receptor MD-2.We demonstrate that eight TLR signaling pathway genes are under positive selection in cetaceans. These include key genes in the response to Gram-negative bacteria: TLR4, CD14, and LY96 (MD-2). Moreover, 41 out of 65 positively selected sites were inferred to harbor substitution that dramatically changes the physicochemical properties of amino , with most of them situated in or adjacent to functional regions. We also found strong evidence that positive selection occurred in the lineage of the Yangtze finless porpoise, likely reflecting relatively recent adaptions to a freshwater milieu. Species-specific differences in TLR4 response were observed between cetacean and terrestrial species. Cetacean TLR4 was significantly less responsive to lipopolysaccharides from a terrestrial E. coli strain, possibly a reflection of the arms race of host-pathogen co-evolution faced by cetaceans in an aquatic environment.This study provides further impetus for studies on the evolution and function of the cetacean immune system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563555>Litopenaeus vannamei CK2 is involved in shrimp innate  by modulating hemocytes apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Protein kinase CK2 (CK2) is a ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase with multiple cellular functions in vertebrates including apoptosis, differentiation, proliferation, survival, tumorigenesis, signal transduction, immune regulation and inflammation. In the current study, the catalytic and regulatory subunit homologs of Litopenaeus vannamei protein kinase CK2 (LvCK2α and LvCK2β) were cloned and characterized. LvCK2α has a full-length cDNA sequence of 1764 bp with a 1053 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative protein of 351 amino , which contains a typical serine/threonine kinase domain. On the other hand, LvCK2β has a 1394 bp full-length cDNA with an ORF of 663 bp encoding a protein with 221 amino , which contains a Casein kinase II regulatory subunit domain. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that LvCK2 was evolutionary related with the CK2 of invertebrates. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis showed that LvCK2α and LvCK2β transcripts were widely expressed in all shrimp tissues tested, and were both induced in hemocytes and hepatopancreas upon challenge with Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Streptoccocus iniae, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), suggesting their involvement in shrimp immune response. Moreover, RNA interference (RNAi) of LvCK2α resulted in increased hemocytes apoptosis, shown by high caspase 3/7 activity, increased number of apoptotic cells, coupled with an elevation in transcript levels of pro-apoptotic LvCaspase3 and LvCytochrome C, and a reduction in mRNA levels of pro-survival LvBcl2, LvIAP1, and LvIAP2. In addition, LvCK2α knockdown followed by V. parahaemolyticus challenge resulted in higher cumulative mortality of shrimp. Taken together, our current findings suggest that LvCK2 modulates shrimp hemocytes apoptosis as part of the innate immune response to pathogens.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The metabolites were extracted at 15 min, 1 and 4 h following treatment with polymyxin B alone (2 mg/L for FADDI-PA111; 4 mg/L for LESB58), amikacin alone (2 mg/L) and in combination; and analyzed using LC-MS. At 15 min and 1 h, polymyxin B alone induced significant perturbations in glycerophospholipid and fatty  metabolism pathways in FADDI-PA111, and to a lesser extent in LESB58. Amikacin alone at 1 and 4 h induced significant perturbations in peptide and amino  metabolism, which is in line with the mode of action of aminoglycosides. Pathway analysis of FADDI-PA111 revealed that the synergistic effect of the combination was largely due to the inhibition of cell envelope biogenesis which was initially driven by polymyxin B via suppression of key metabolites involved in lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan and membrane lipids (15 min and 1 h) and later by amikacin (4 h). Overall, these novel findings demonstrate that the disruption of the cell envelope biogenesis, central carbohydrate metabolism, decreased levels of amino sugars and a downregulated nucleotide pool are the metabolic pathways associated with the synergistic killing of polymyxin-amikacin combination against  This mechanistic study might help optimizing synergistic polymyxin B combinations in the clinical setting.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621292>Exploiting the Lymph-Node-Amplifying Effect for Potent Systemic and Gastrointestinal Immune Responses  Polymer/Lipid Nanoparticles.</a></h2><p>Parenteral vaccinations are not able to elicit effective systemic and gastrointestinal immune protection simultaneously because the lymphocytes are typically restricted to primed tissues. Although all- retinoic  (RA) was reported to trigger the gut-homing of immunocytes, the bioavailability and systemic immune responses remain limited for use in robust enteric vaccinations. Here, we show that co-delivery of RA, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG), and antigens  engineered polymer/lipid nanoparticles (PLNPs) could exploit the amplifying function of draining lymph nodes (DLNs) for potent gut tropism and immune activations. After intramuscular injection, forming an immune-potentiated environment at the injection site, the PLNPs induced the designated transfer of primed dendritic cells (DCs) to the DLNs instead of the gastrointestinal tissues. Within the DLNs, the immune-potentiated environment markedly amplified the antigen presentation and homing receptor switch among immunocytes, which simultaneously stimulated the preferential dissipation of activated lymphocytes in the peripheral and gastrointestinal tissues, that is, exerted a DLN-amplifying effect. Compared with current RA-containing formulations, the PLNPs not only boosted potent IgG secretions and T cell activations in the peripheral tissue but also provoked robust T cell homing and antigen-specific IgA levels in the gastrointestinal tracts in both ovalbumin and EV71 vaccinations. These data indicate that exploiting DLN amplification can stimulate potent systemic and gastrointestinal responses for more efficient enteric vaccinations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616403>Metabolic Insight of Neutrophils in Health and Disease.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils are the most abundant, short lived, and terminally differentiated leukocytes with distinct tiers of arsenals to counter pathogens.

Furthermore, recent unfolding of metabolic plasticity in neutrophils has challenged the long-standing concept of their sole dependence on glycolytic pathway. Metabolic adaptations and distinct regulations have been identified which are critical for neutrophil differentiation and functions. The metabolic reprogramming of neutrophils by inflammatory mediators or during pathologies such as sepsis, diabetes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, glycogen storage diseases (GSDs), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer are now being explored.

Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammatory regulation plays an important role in pathophysiology and therapeutic mechanism across the major psychiatric disorders. "Inflammation theory" might not be the full answer for the big picture of mental disorders, but it might explain high occurrence of somatic symptoms and comorbidity of physical illness in certain subtypes of the heterogeneous groups. Due to the complexity of clinical manifestations and bio-psycho-social etiology, each single treatment shows only small effectiveness with limited effect sizes when compared with placebo. Unfortunately, clinicians are still struggling with trial-and-error practice without any reliable clinical or biological markers to predict therapeutic responses. Therefore, it is important to open up our minds to integrative approaches such dietary modification and nutraceutical prescription. In this special issue, we included 15 papers discussing the role of nutrition (blueberries, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty , melatonergic agonist, S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine, Cannabidiol and Kratom) in the context of immunoregulation across different psychiatric disorders from depression, bipolar disorders, and schizophrenia to alcohol-induced dementia and anorexia nervosa. Moreover, we also included research in perinatal depression that highlight the role of estradiol and the component of breast milk and the association with the neurodevelopment of the offspring. In addition, several articles focused on the role of microbiota in mental health and pain as recent research has pointed to the gut-brain axis as a main regulator of brain, behaviour and .

Their dominance has been partially explained by the continuous emergence of antigenically distinct variants. To gain insights into the mechanisms of viral emergence and population dynamics of GII.4 noroviruses, we performed large-scale genomics, structural, and mutational analyses of the viral capsid protein (VP1). GII.4 noroviruses exhibited a periodic replacement of predominant variants with accumulation of amino  substitutions. Genomic analyses revealed (i) a large proportion (87%) of conserved residues; (ii) variable residues that map on the previously determined antigenic sites; and (iii) variable residues that map outside the antigenic sites. Residues in the third pattern category formed motifs on the surface of VP1, which suggested extensions of previously predicted and new uncharacterized antigenic sites. The role of two motifs (C and G) in the antigenic makeup of the GII.4 capsid protein was confirmed with monoclonal antibodies and carbohydrate blocking assays. Amino  profiles from antigenic sites (A, C, D, E, and G) correlated with the circulation patterns of GII.4 variants, with three of them (A, C, and G) containing residues (352, 357, 368, and 378) linked with the diversifying selective pressure on the emergence of new GII.4 variants. Notably, the emergence of each variant was followed by stochastic diversification with minimal changes that did not progress toward the next variant. This report provides a methodological framework for antigenic characterization of viruses and expands our understanding of the dynamics of GII.4 noroviruses and could facilitate the design of cross-reactive vaccines. Noroviruses are an important cause of viral gastroenteritis around the world. An obstacle delaying the development of norovirus vaccines is inadequate understanding of the role of norovirus diversity in . Using a population genomics approach, we identified new residues on the viral capsid protein (VP1) from GII.4 noroviruses, the predominant genotype, that appear to be involved in the emergence and antigenic topology of GII.4 variants. Careful monitoring of the substitutions in those residues involved in the diversification and emergence of new viruses could help in the early detection of future novel variants with pandemic potential. Therefore, this novel information on the antigenic diversification could facilitate GII.4 norovirus vaccine design.</p></html>
