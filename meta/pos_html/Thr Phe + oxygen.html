In the present study, the in vitro and cellular free radical scavenging activities of corn peptide fractions (CPFs) were investigated. Results indicated that CPF1 (molecular weight less than 1 kDa) and CPF2 (molecular weight between 1 and 3 kDa) exhibited good hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion radical and 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonicacid) diammonium salt (ABTS) radical scavenging activity and  radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). Meanwhile, the in vitro radical scavenging activity of CPF1 was slightly higher than that of CPF2. Both CPF1 and CPF2 also exhibited significant cytoprotective effects and intracellular reactive  species scavenging activity in Caco-2 cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The amino acid composition analysis revealed that the CPF were rich in hydrophobic amino acids, which comprised of more than 45% of total amino acids. An antioxidant peptide sequence of Tyr--Cys-Leu- (YFCLT) was identified from CPF1 using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF/TOF MS). The YFCLT exhibited excellent ABTS radical scavenging activity with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) value of 37.63 µM, which was much lower than that of Trolox. In conclusion, corn gluten meal might be a good source to prepare antioxidant peptides.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28374069>Mu and kappa opioid receptors of the periaqueductal gray stimulate and inhibit thermogenesis, respectively, during psychological stress in rats.</a></h2><p>The periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) is rich in mu and kappa opioid receptors, and this system is involved in thermoregulation, analgesia, and defensive behaviors. No study approached the involvement of the PAG opioids in body temperature (Tb) regulation during psychological stress such as restraint. Because activation of mu and kappa receptors increases and reduces Tb, respectively, we tested the hypothesis that they exert excitatory and inhibitory modulation, respectively, of the restraint-induced fever in rats. To this end, Tb, heat loss index (HLI, inference for peripheral vasoconstriction/vasodilation), and  consumption (inference for thermogenesis) were monitored in unanesthetized rats, restrained or unrestrained, before and after intra-PAG microinjection of the selective mu opioid receptor antagonist (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH cyclic, CTAP; 1 and 10 μg/100 nL) or the selective kappa opioid receptor antagonist (nor-binaltorphimine dihydrochloride, nor-BNI; 1 and 4 μg/100 nL) or saline (100 nL). CTAP and nor-BNI did not change the Tb or HLI of euthermic animals. During restraint, Tb increased (1.0 ± 0.1 °C) in all groups; however, this effect was lower in those animals treated with CTAP and higher in animals treated with nor-BNI. The HLI decreased during restraint and increased after animals were released, but this response was not affected by any treatment. Restraint stress increased  consumption (35.9 ± 3.9% elevation), but this response was diminished by CTAP and overstimulated by nor-BNI. Confirming our hypothesis, the results indicate that the mu and kappa opioid receptors in the PAG of rats play a pyrogenic and antipyretic role, respectively, during fever induced by restraint by affecting the thermogenic but not the heat conservation effector.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29078103>Ethanol binding sites on proteins.</a></h2><p>This study is on the analysis of ethanol binding sites on 3D structures of nonredundant proteins from the Protein Data Bank. The only one amino acid residue that is significantly overrepresented around ethanol molecules is Tyr. There are usually two or more Tyr residues in the same ethanol binding site, while residues of , Asp and Gln are underrepresented around them. Residues of Ala and Pro are significantly underrepresented in ethanol binding surfaces. Several residues (, Val, Pro, Ala, Arg, His, Ser, Asp) bind ethanol significantly more frequent if they are not included in beta strands. Residues of Ala, Ile and Arg preferably bind ethanol when they are included in an alpha helix. Ethanol molecules often make hydrogen bonds with  and nitrogen atoms from the main chain of a protein. Because of this reason, the binding of ethanol may be associated with the decrease of the length of alpha helices and the disappearance of 3/10 helices. Obtained data should be useful for studies on new targets of the direct action of ethanol on enzymes, receptors, and transcription factors.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The antioxidant capacities were tested by ORAC ( Radical Antioxidant Capacity) and HORAC (Hydroxyl Radical Averting Capacity) methods.All substances expressed significantly higher antioxidant capacity by comparison with galic acid and Trolox. All substances showed considerable antioxidant capacity as well. Compound 2T (D--c(Cys-Tyr-DTrp- Dap-Tle-Cys)--NH2)had the highest antioxidant effect. The compound 4T (D--c(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp- Orn-Tle-Cys)--NH2) displayed antiproliferative effect on HeLa cells with IC50 30 µM. The peptide analog 3T (D--c(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Tle-Cys)--NH2) exerted the most pronounced inhibition on the cell vitality up to 53%, 56% and 65% resp. against MDA-MB-23, Hep G-2, HeLa in the higher tested concentration.The somatostatin analogs showed moderate influence on the vitality of different tumor cells and could be used in changing their pathology.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28635255>Characterization and Immunomodulatory Activity of a Novel Peptide, ECFSTA, from Wheat Germ Globulin.</a></h2><p>A novel peptide was extracted from wheat germ globulin and purified using ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and semi-preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The sequence of the peptide was found to be Glu-Cys--Ser--Ala (ECFSTA). Its immunomodulatory effects were evaluated, and the results showed that ECFSTA could enhance phagocytosis of RAW 264.7 cells and significantly increase their secretion of nitric oxide (NO), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and reactive  species (ROS). ECFSTA activated macrophages mainly through the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and the production of ROS simultaneously stimulated macrophages to produce TNF-α. Thus, ECFSTA could be used as an immunomodulator and might be a promising component of functional foods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28873586>Isolation of a novel calcium-binding peptide from wheat germ protein hydrolysates and the prediction for its mechanism of combination.</a></h2><p>To isolate a novel peptide with specific calcium-binding capacity, wheat germ protein was hydrolyzed. The hydrolysates were purified using ultrafiltration, anion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequence of the purified peptide was determined and confirmed to be FVDVT (-Val-Asp-Val-). The calcium-binding capacity of FVDVT reached 89.94±0.75%, increased by 86.37% compared to the hydrolysates. The chelating mechanism between FVDVT and calcium was further investigated by Ultraviolet-Visible absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and H nuclear magnetic resonances spectroscopy. The results indicated that the  atoms of the carboxy group and the nitrogen atoms of the amido group provided major binding sites. In addition, aspartic acid and threonine show considerable capacity for incorporating with calcium by donating electron pairs. This study provides a feasible approach to isolate calcium-binding peptides and to clarify the possible binding mechanism of calcium and peptide.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The amino acid composition of peptides was also analyzed by amino acid analyzer on the basis of ninhydrin reaction. Three novel peptides with molecular weights of 628.64 Da, 630.71 Da, and 684.1 Da were identified as Asp-His--Lys-Glu (DHTKE), --Glu--His (FFGFN) and Met-Pro-Asp-Ala-His-Leu (MPDAHL), respectively. DHTKE exhibited the best  radical absorbance capacity (P<0.05). The concentration of FFGFN and MPDAHL to scavenge 50% of DPPH radicals was 80 mM and 60mM, respectively. Thus, the three peptides may have potential applications as a functional food, which could also be used as nutraceutical compounds.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p></html>
