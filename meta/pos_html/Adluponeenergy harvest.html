Bananas undergo a rapid ripening process after , resulting in a short shelf. In this study, the mechanism underlying pulp ripening of harvested bananas was investigated using integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analysis. Ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-Seq) revealed that a great number of genes related to transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, cell wall modification, and secondary metabolism were up-regulated during pulp ripening. At the protein level, 84 proteins were differentially expressed during pulp ripening, most of which were associated with  metabolism, oxidation-reduction, cell wall metabolism, and starch degradation. According to partial least squares discriminant analysis, 33 proteins were identified as potential markers for separating different ripening stages of the fruit. In addition to ethylene's central role, auxin signal transduction might be involved in regulating pulp ripening. Moreover, secondary metabolism,  metabolism, and the protein metabolic process also played an important role in pulp ripening. In all, this study provided a better understanding of pulp ripening of harvested bananas.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450636>A High-Voltage -Harvesting Interface for Irregular Kinetic  Harvesting in IoT Systems with 1365% Improvement Using All-NMOS Power Switches and Ultra-low Quiescent Current Controller.</a></h1><p>An -harvesting interface for kinetic  harvesting from high-voltage piezoelectric and triboelectric generators is proposed in this paper. Unlike the conventional kinetic -harvesting interfaces optimized for continuous sinusoidal input, the proposed harvesting interface can efficiently handle irregular and random high voltage  inputs. An N-type mosfet (NMOS)-only power stage design is introduced to simplify power switch drivers and minimize conduction loss. Controller active mode power is also reduced by introducing a new voltage peak detector. For efficient operation with potentially long intervals between random kinetic  inputs, standby power consumption is minimized by monitoring the input with a 43 pW wake-up controller and power-gating all other circuits during the standby intervals. The proposed harvesting interface can   from a wide range of  inputs, 10 s of nJ to 10 s of µJ /pulse, with an input voltage range of 5-200 V and an output range of 2.4-4 V under discontinuous as well as continuous excitation. The proposed interface is examined in two scenarios, with integrated power stage devices (maximum input 45 V) and with discrete power stage devices (maximum input 200 V), and the harvesting efficiency is improved by up to 600% and 1350%, respectively, compared to the case when harvesting is performed with a full bridge rectifier.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690680>Photoferrotrophs Produce a PioAB Electron Conduit for Extracellular Electron Uptake.</a></h1><p>Photoferrotrophy is a form of anoxygenic photosynthesis whereby bacteria utilize soluble or insoluble forms of ferrous iron as an electron donor to fix carbon dioxide using light . They can also use poised electrodes as their electron donor via phototrophic extracellular electron uptake (phototrophic EEU). The electron uptake mechanisms underlying these processes are not well understood. Using  TIE-1 as a model, we show that a single periplasmic decaheme cytochrome , PioA, and an outer membrane porin, PioB, form a complex allowing extracellular electron uptake across the outer membrane from both soluble iron and poised electrodes. We observe that PioA undergoes postsecretory proteolysis of its N terminus to produce a shorter heme-attached PioA (holo-PioA, where PioA represents the C terminus of PioA), which can exist both freely in the periplasm and in a complex with PioB. The extended N-terminal peptide controls heme attachment, and its processing is required to produce wild-type levels of holo-PioA and holo-PioAB complex. It is also conserved in PioA homologs from other phototrophs. The presence of PioAB in these organisms correlate with their ability to perform photoferrotrophy and phototrophic EEU. Some anoxygenic phototrophs use soluble iron, insoluble iron minerals (such as rust), or their proxies (poised electrodes) as electron donors for photosynthesis. However, the underlying electron uptake mechanisms are not well established. Here, we show that these phototrophs use a protein complex made of an outer membrane porin and a periplasmic decaheme cytochrome (electron transfer protein) to  electrons from both soluble iron and poised electrodes. This complex has two unique characteristics: (i) it lacks an extracellular cytochrome , and (ii) the periplasmic decaheme cytochrome  undergoes proteolytic cleavage to produce a functional electron transfer protein. These characteristics are conserved in phototrophs harboring homologous proteins.Copyright © 2019 Gupta et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31329409>Diffusion and Current Generation in Porous Electrodes for Thermo-electrochemical Cells.</a></h1><p>Carbon-based porous electrodes have led to remarkable improvements in the performance of thermochemical cells or thermocells that electrochemically  low-grade waste thermal . However, the output current from the thermocells is hampered by the diffusion effect, which leads to depleted ion concentration as the ions permeate through the porous electrode. Here, we advance a theoretical basis for a quantitative description of the diffusion effect on current generation in such porous electrodes. One single dimensionless parameter of Thiele modulus describes the effect according to the theory adopted from the well-established results in the literature. Experimental results for carbon fiber electrodes are illustrated and quantified by the theory. The theory presented here would provide a basis for the choice and design of porous electrodes for thermocells.

Recent advances in high-throughput MS combined with improved metabolomics techniques and bioinformatic tools provide new opportunities for dietary biomarker development. In September 2018, the NIH organized a 2-d workshop to engage nutrition and omics researchers and explore the potential of multiomics approaches in nutritional biomarker research. The current Perspective summarizes key gaps and challenges identified, as well as the recommendations from the workshop that could serve as a guide for scientists interested in dietary biomarkers research. Topics addressed included study designs for biomarker development, analytical and bioinformatic considerations, and integration of dietary biomarkers with other omics techniques. Several clear needs were identified, including larger controlled feeding studies, testing a variety of foods and dietary patterns across diverse populations, improved reporting standards to support study replication, more chemical standards covering a broader range of food constituents and human metabolites, standardized approaches for biomarker validation, comprehensive and accessible food composition databases, a common ontology for dietary biomarker literature, and methodologic work on statistical procedures for intake biomarker discovery. Multidisciplinary research teams with appropriate expertise are critical to moving forward the field of dietary biomarkers and producing robust, reproducible biomarkers that can be used in public health and clinical research.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128545>Vertical alignment of polyaniline nanofibers on electrode surface for high-performance microbial fuel cells.</a></h1><p>Electrode modifications with conductive and nanostructured polyaniline (PANI) were recognized as efficient approach to improve interaction between electrode surface and electrogenic bacteria for boosting the performance of microbial fuel cell (MFC). However, it still showed undesirable performance because of the challenge to control the orientation (such as vertical alignment) of PANI nanostructure for extracellular electron transfer (EET). In this work, vertically aligned polyaniline (VA-PANI) on carbon cloth electrode surface were prepared by in-situ polymerization method (simply tuning the ratio of tartaric acid (TA) dopant). Impressively, the VA-PANI greatly improved the EET due to the increased opportunity to connect with conductive proteins.

This study aimed to optimize the nutritional and sensory quality of complementary food product through compositing and extrusion of various local ingredients. A constrained D-optimal mixture experiment with 13 runs was designed. Accordingly, 55-65 g/100 g oats, 11-23 g/100 g soybean and 6-11 g/100 g linseed, and a premix of 9.9 g/100 g sugar, 0.6 g/100 g table salt, three g/100 g moringa and 1.5 g/100 g fenugreek were blended and extruded using a co-rotating twin screw extruder with set parameters. Statistical model evaluation and optimization were done using Minitab version 16 software package. There is a statistically significant ( < 0.05) association between the blend of oats and soybean, oats and linseed, soybean and linseed, and the protein, fat, carbohydrate, fiber, ash, β-carotene content as well as aroma, taste, and consistency. On the contrary, there is a no statistically significant ( < 0.05) association between the blends and moisture, , and zinc content together with appearance and overall acceptability. The optimal blending ratio was 55.0 g/100 g oats, 21.0 g/100 g soybean, and 9.0 g/100 g linseed plus 15.0 g/100 g premix.

All the silages were stored at 25 ºC. Parameters such as pH, microorganism and volatile fatty acid contents, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, net gas, metabolizable , organic matter digestibility, dry matter intake and relative feed value were measured to determine fermentation quality, chemical compositions and relative feed value of alfalfa silages.Significant differences were found among the control and treated groups in terms of pH and microorganism contents at all opening times and crude protein, net gas, metabolizable  and organic matter digestibility of final silage. The pH values ranged from 4.70 to 5.52 for all treatments and control silage had the highest value of overall treatments at T75d silages. Volatile fatty acid of silages was not influenced significantly by inoculations. However, lactic acid content of L. bifermentans (LS-65-2-1) was higher than the other treatments. The highest metabolizable  and organic matter digestibility were recorded from L. citerum (L-70-6-1) inoculation.

The obtained physical properties together with theoretical calculations analyzed from these new molecules establish a clear structure-property relationship, in which the feature of central acceptor 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT), naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c']bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NT), and 2,1,3-naphthothiadiazole (NBT) plays the crucial role for governing the physical characteristics. The optimized device configured as ITO/HAT-CN/TAPC/TCTA/TCTA:3P-T2T:5% emitter/3P-T2T/LiF/Al gave a record-high efficiency of orange red (591 nm, 15%), red (647 nm, 10%), and deep-red/NIR (689 nm, 9%) electroluminescent devices. The effective  of triplet excitons with an exciplex-forming system in conjunction with efficient  transfer between the exciplex and the dopant is beneficial for such high device efficiencies. More importantly, the stable exciplex-forming cohost and fast radiative decay rate of DTPNT render this particular device exhibiting high device stability as indicated by the low efficiency roll-off under high current densities (EQE (external quantum efficiency) values of 8.1% at 1000 cd m and 6.8% at 10,000 cd m). These results reveal the potential of employing an exciplex-forming system as cohost for fluorescent dopants to furnish high-efficiency OLEDs with an emission wavelength extending to the red or even the NIR range.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840230>From gut microbiota dysfunction to obesity: could short-chain fatty acids stop this dangerous course?</a></h1><p>Study of the interactions between the gut microbiota and brain-gut axis represents a very appealing approach to increasing our knowledge about the mechanisms leading to obesity and obesity-related diseases. The aim of this review is to focus on the effects of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are the main products of gut microbial fermentation from non-digestible carbohydrates in the colon, on the gut-brain axis. Evidence is accumulating regarding the role of SCFAs in the fine-tuning of the gut-brain axis, a feedback system which is vital not only for the proper maintenance of gastrointestinal and metabolic functions, but also for the regulation of food intake and  expenditure. SCFAs are thought to play a key role in increasing the host capacity to  excess  from the diet. SCFAs, however, can exert their effects on the host metabolism via multiple complementary pathways. Metabolic, inflammatory, and neural pathways can be regulated by SCFAs, which can act by sensing nutritional status, thereby maintaining body  homeostasis. SCFA production from prebiotic consumption is the rationale for targeting intestinal mechanisms to increase  expenditure and thereby reduce obesity risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30892809>An Integrated Approach Toward Renewable  Storage Using Rechargeable Ag@Ni Co S-Based Hybrid Supercapacitors.</a></h1><p>Self-powered charging systems in conjunction with renewable  conversion and storage devices have attracted promising attention in recent years. In this work, a prolific approach to design a wind/solar-powered rechargeable high- density pouch-type hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) is proposed. The pouch-type HSC is fabricated by engineering nature-inspired nanosliver (nano-Ag) decorated Ni Co S forest-like nanostructures on Ni foam (nano-Ag@NCS FNs/Ni foam) as a battery-type electrode and porous activated carbon as a capacitive-type electrode. Initially, the core-shell-like NCS FNs/Ni foam is prepared via a single-step wet-chemical method, followed by a light-induced growth of nano-Ag onto it for enhancing the conductivity of the composite. Utilizing the synergistic effects of forest-like nano-Ag@NCS FNs/Ni foam as a composite electrode, the fabricated device shows a maximum capacitance of 1104.14 mF cm at a current density of 5 mA cm and it stores superior  and power densities of 0.36 mWh cm and 27.22 mW cm , respectively along with good cycling stability, which are higher than most of previous reports.

The great challenge is to optimize trade-offs between carbon  and water use by choosing cultivars that combine low water use with high productivity.Regional scenarios were simulated over a range of willow genotype × environment interactions for the major UK soil × climate variations with the process-based model LUCASS. Soil available water capacity (SAWC) ranged from 51 to 251 mm and weather represented the north-west (wet, cool), north-east (dry, cool), south-west (wet, warm) and south-east (dry, warm) of the UK. Scenario simulations were evaluated for small/open narrow-leaf (NL) versus large/closed broad-leaf (BL) willow canopy phenotypes using baseline (1965-89) and warmer recent (1990-2014) weather data.The low productivity under baseline climate in the north could be compensated by choosing BL cultivars (e.g. 'Endurance'). Recent warmer climate increased average productivity by 0.5-2.5 t ha-1, especially in the north. The modern NL cultivar 'Resolution' had the smallest and most efficient water use. On marginal soils (SAWC <100 mm), yields remained below an economic threshold of 9 t ha-1 more frequently under baseline than recent climate. In the drought-prone south-east, 'Endurance' yielded less than 'Resolution', which consumed on average 17 mm year-1 less water. Assuming a planting area of 10 000 ha, in droughty years between 1.3 and 4.5 × 106 m3 of water could be saved, with a small yield penalty, for 'Resolution'.With an increase in air temperature and occasional water scarcities expected with climate change, high-yielding NL cultivars should be the preferred choice for sustainable use of marginal lands and reduced competition with agricultural food crops.© The Author(s) 2019.

They have attracted a lot of interest for biotechnological applications in light of their eco-friendliness: they indeed oxidize the substrate(s) by coupling the four electron reduction of the final acceptor, molecular oxygen (O), to water. Plant LMCOs represent a still poorly studied, important class of oxidoreductases controlling e.g. the post- quality of fruits and enabling the tailoring of designer  crops. We here sought to identify the LMCOs in Prunus avium L., whose fruits are rich in bioactive molecules, but are also highly perishable. The goal was to analyze them using bioinformatics (phylogenetic and in silico structural analyses) and to perform a targeted expression study on a subset of genes in six ancient varieties from Tuscany, all threatened by genetic erosion.

Recently, radio frequency (RF)  harvesting technologies, which scavenge the ambient RF waves, provided us with a new paradigm for such networks. Without replacement or recharge of batteries, an RF  harvesting wireless sensor network may live an eternal life. Against theoretical expectations, however,  is scarce in practice and, consequently, structural naiveté has to be within a MAC scheme that supports a sensor node to deliver its data to a sink node. Our practical choice for the MAC scheme is a basic one, rooted in ALOHA, in which a sensor node simply repeats harvesting , backing off for a while and transmitting a packet. The basic medium access control (MAC) scheme is not able to perfectly prevent a collision of packets, which in turn deteriorates the throughput. Thus, we derive an exact expression of the throughput that the basic MAC scheme can attain. In various case studies, we then look for a way to enhance the throughput. Using the throughput formula, we reveal that an optimal back-off time, which maximizes the total throughput, is not characterized by the distribution but only by the mean value when the  times are deterministic. Also, we confirm that taking proper back-off times is able to improve the throughput even when the  times are random. Furthermore, we show that shaping the back-off time so that its variance is increased while its mean remains unchanged can help ameliorate the throughput that the basic MAC scheme is able to achieve.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31024582>Exploring Agronomic and Physiological Traits Associated With the Differences in Productivity Between Triticale and Bread Wheat in Mediterranean Environments.</a></h1><p>In Mediterranean climates soil water deficit occurs mainly during the spring and summer, having a great impact on cereal productivity.

For this purpose, two sets of experiments were conducted in order to compare a high yielding triticale (cv. Aguacero) and spring wheat (cvs. Pandora and Domo). The first experiment, aiming to analyze the agronomic performance, was carried out in 10 sites located across a wide range of Mediterranean and temperate environments, distributed between 33°34' and 38°41' S. The second experiment, aiming to identify potential physiological traits linked to the different yields of the two crops, was conducted in two Mediterranean sites (Cauquenes and Santa Rosa) in which crops were grown under well-watered (WW) and water-limited (WL) conditions. The relationship between GY and the environmental index revealed that triticale exhibited a higher regression coefficient (Finlay and Wilkinson slope), indicating a more stable response to the environment, accompanied by higher yields than bread wheat.  index was not significantly different between the two cereals, but triticale had higher kernels per spike (35%) and 1000 kernel weight (16%) than wheat, despite a lower number of spikes per square meter. The higher yield of triticale was linked to higher values of chlorophyll content, leaf net photosynthesis (An), the maximum rate of electron transport (ETRmax), the photochemical quantum yield of PSII [Y(II)] and leaf water-use efficiency. GY was positively correlated with Ci at anthesis and ΔC in both species, as well as with gs at anthesis in triticale, but negatively correlated with non-photochemical fluorescence quenching and quantum yield of non-photochemical  conversion at grain filling in wheat. These results revealed that triticale presented higher photosynthetic rates that contributed to increase plant growth and yield in the different environments, whereas wheat showed higher photoprotection system in detriment of assimilate production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31278079>Spastin joins LDs and peroxisomes in the interorganelle contact ballet.</a></h1><p>Lipid droplets (LDs) store -rich fatty acids (FAs), but to  them, LDs donate FAs to peroxisomes for oxidation.

Hayward fruit is renowned for its micro- and macronutrients, which vary in their levels during berry physiological development and postharvest processing. In this context, we have recently described metabolic pathways/molecular effectors in fruit outer endocarp characterizing the different stages of berry physiological maturation. Here, we report on the kiwifruit postharvest phase through an integrated approach consisting of pomological analysis combined with NMR/LC-UV/ESI-IT-MS- and 2D-DIGE/nanoLC-ESI-LIT-MS/MS-based proteometabolomic measurements. Kiwifruit samples stored under conventional, cold-based postharvest conditions not involving the use of dedicated chemicals were sampled at four stages (from fruit  to pre-commercialization) and analyzed in comparison for pomological features, and outer endocarp metabolite and protein content. About 42 metabolites were quantified, together with corresponding proteomic changes. Proteomics showed that proteins associated with disease/defense, , protein destination/storage, cell structure and metabolism functions were affected at precise fruit postharvest times, providing a justification to corresponding pomological/metabolite content characteristics. Bioinformatic analysis of variably represented proteins revealed a central network of interacting species, modulating metabolite level variations during postharvest fruit storage. Kiwifruit allergens were also quantified, demonstrating in some cases their highest levels at the fruit pre-commercialization stage. By lining up kiwifruit postharvest processing to a proteometabolomic depiction, this study integrates previous observations on metabolite and protein content in postharvest berries treated with specific chemical additives, and provides a reference framework for further studies on the optimization of fruit storage before its commercialization.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621728>Effects of theabrownin on serum metabolites and gut microbiome in rats with a high-sugar diet.</a></h1><p>Evidence has proven that the gut microbiota is an important environmental factor contributing to obesity by altering host   and storage. We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus. The combination also inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group and Tyzzerella. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the obesity-associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of deoxycholic acid, cholic acid, 1H-indole-3-acetic acid, 3-indole acrylic acid and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. 2-Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic acid, l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome. In a high sugar diet mode, theabrownin reduced the body weight and triglycerides and improved insulin resistance mainly by targeting the reproduction of intestinal microorganisms such as BA, Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, Gut_metagenome and so on. A strong correlation between cecal microorganisms and serum metabolites, obesity and insulin resistance was observed. Theabrownin has high potential in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as diabetes and obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31242736>Q  and Q  Absorption Bands for Bacteriochlorophyll a Molecules from LH2 and LH3.</a></h1><p>Light-harvesting systems 2 and 3 (LH2 and LH3) act as antennas for the initial light capture by photosynthetic purple bacteria, thus initiating the conversion of solar  into chemical . The main absorbers are carotenoids and bacteriochlorophylls (BChls), which  different parts of the solar spectrum. The first two optical transitions in BChl produce the Q  and Q  absorption bands. The large size of BChl molecules has prevented accurate computational determination of the electronic structures for the relevant states, until we recently succeeded in obtaining the excitation energies and transition dipole moments of the first (Q ) transition for all BChls in LH2 and LH3 using multi-state multiconfigurational second-order perturbation theory calculations. In this work, we go one step further, compute the corresponding values for the Q  transition, in line with previous work [ J. Am. Chem. Soc . 2017 , 139 , 7558 - 7567 ], and compare and assess our data against excitation energies obtained through time-dependent density functional theory methods. Interestingly, we find that the two transitions respond differently to BChls' geometrical factors, such as the macrocycle ring curvature and the dihedral torsion of the acetyl moiety. These findings will aid the unraveling of structure-function relationships for absorption and  transfer processes in purple bacteria, and once again this demonstrates the viability of multireference quantum chemical methods as computational tools for the photophysics of biomolecules.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312897>The selection of a surfactant for freshwater microalgae harvesting and separation by the foam separation method.</a></h1><p>Collecting microalgae from water with less  and cost is significant to gain economic profit from microalgae harvesting and processing.

Two-dimensional (2D) nanofluidic membranes fabricated with electrically conductive nanosheets have high ion conductivity and voltage-gated ion transport behaviors. However, the voltage-gating effect of the sub-nanometer-sized 2D channel membranes has not been well-investigated. In this work, a high-performance voltage-gated 2D nanofluidic device is constructed by assembling MXene nanosheets into a laminar membrane with sub-1 nm interlayer channels. By applying external voltage to the membrane, the ion conductivity of the device is enhanced by positive voltages and reduced by negative voltages, exhibiting a high voltage-gating on-off ratio of ∼10. The on-off ratio is found to be dependent on ion concentration and ion species. This work demonstrates that 2D membranes with interlayer spacings comparable to those of hydrated ion diameters can achieve high and tunable voltage-gating function, which provides a strategy to construct devices for highly efficient on-demand ion transport.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314772> harvesting based routing protocol for underwater sensor networks.</a></h1><p>Underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) are ad-hoc networks which are deployed at rivers, seas and oceans to explore and monitor the phenomena such as pollution control, seismic activities and petroleum mining etc. The sensor nodes of UWSNs have limited charging capabilities. UWSNs networks are generally operated under two deployment mechanisms i.e localization and non-localization based. However, in both the mechanisms, balanced  utilization is a challenging issue. Inefficient usage of  significantly affects stability period, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, path loss and throughput of a network. To efficiently utilize and  , this paper present a novel scheme called EH-ARCUN ( Harvesting Analytical approach towards Reliability with Cooperation for UWSNs) based on cooperation with  harvesting. The scheme employs Amplify-and-Forward (AF) technique at relay nodes for data forwarding and Fixed Combining Ratio (FCR) technique at destination node to select accurate signal. The proposed technique selects relay nodes among its neighbor nodes based on harvested  level. Most cooperation-based UWSN routing techniques do not exhibit  harvesting mechanism at the relay nodes. EH-ARCUN deploys piezoelectric  harvesting at relay nodes to improve the working capabilities of sensors in UWSNs. The proposed scheme is an extension of our previously implemented routing scheme called ARCUN for UWSNs. Performance of the proposed scheme is compared with ARCUN and RACE (Reliability and Adaptive Cooperation for efficient Underwater sensor Networks) schemes in term of stability period, packet delivery ratio, network throughput and path loss. Extensive simulation results show that EH-ARCUN performs better than both previous schemes in terms of the considered parameters.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31257850>Thiol and Halometallate, Mutually Passivated Quantum Dot Ink for Photovoltaic Application.</a></h1><p>Tunable-band-gap colloidal QDs are a potential building block to  the wide- solar spectrum. The solution-phase surface passivation with lead halide-based halometallate ligands has remarkably simplified the processing of quantum dots (QDs) and enabled the proficient use of materials for the development of solar cells. It is, however, shown that the hallometalate ligand passivated QD ink allows the formation of thick crystalline shell layer, which limits the carrier transport of the QD solids. Organic thiols have long been used to develop QD solar cells using the solid-state ligand exchange approach. However, their use is limited in solution-phase passivation due to poor dispersity of thiol-treated QDs in common solvents. In this report, a joint passivation strategy using thiol and halometallate ligand is developed to prepare the QD ink. The mutually passivated QDs show a 50% reduction in shell thickness, reduced trap density, and improved monodispersity in their solid films. These improvements lead to a 4 times increase in carrier mobility and doubling of the diffusion length, which enable the carrier extraction from a much thicker absorbing layer. The photovoltaic devices show a high efficiency of 10.3% and reduced hysteresis effect. The improvement in surface passivation leads to reduced oxygen doping and improved ambient stability of the solar cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30744716>Effects of ruminal degradability of ensiled whole crop maize varieties on feed intake and milk production of dairy cows.</a></h1><p>The feed value of whole crop maize silage (WCMS) depends on nutrient composition, ruminal degradability and whole tract digestibility. However, as the ruminal degradation rate is involved in physical regulation of feed intake, ruminal degradability of WCMS may also affect feed intake and milk production of dairy cows. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine relationships between nutrient composition, ruminal degradability, and whole tract digestibility of WCMS and feed intake and milk production of dairy cows. Nine varieties were tested in 3 consecutive years. Nutrient composition analyses included proximate analysis and determination of cell wall constituents. Whole tract digestibility was determined in vivo using wethers and ruminal degradability was examined in situ using four rumen-fistulated steers. Feed intake and milk production were measured using nine cows per variety. Cows were fed a ration consisting of 75.0% WCMS, 8.5% hay and 16.5% soya bean meal (dry matter basis) ad libitum. Variety did not influence nutrient composition, except for the concentration of ADF (ADFom), ADL and utilisable CP (uCP). In contrast, variety had a significant effect (P < 0.05) on ruminal degradability of NDF (aNDFom) and on whole tract digestibility of organic matter (OM) and non-fibre carbohydrates. Dry matter intake (DMI) of WCMS tended to be affected by variety (0.05<P < 0.10) whereas no effect on -corrected milk production (ECM) was observed. The year of  had an influence on net  for lactation and uCP concentration, ruminal degradability and whole tract digestibility of nutrients, as well as on DMI and ECM of dairy cows. Whole tract aNDFom digestibility of WCMS was positively correlated with aNDFom concentration (R2 = 0.48) and whole tract OM digestibility (R2 = 0.58). Furthermore, ruminal OM degradability was positively correlated with DMI (R2 = 0.57) and ECM (R2 = 0.49) of dairy cows. The results indicate that ruminal degradability and whole tract digestibility have a greater impact on the feed value of WCMS than nutrient composition and should be focused on to optimise feed intake and milk production of dairy cows. Thus, maize breeders should include ruminal degradability and whole tract digestibility parameters in variety testing programs to increase the informative value of variety descriptions for farmers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31177293>Mapping quantitative trait loci for seed traits in Camelina sativa.</a></h1><p>Genetic dissection of oil content and seed size in Camelina sativa was conducted by QTL mapping using a SNP-based linkage map and a recombinant inbred population. Camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz) is an oilseed crop that has great potential to provide sustainable feedstock for biofuel production and to improve dryland agriculture. A major breeding objective for camelina is to increase seed size and oil content. Understanding the genetics behind variations of seed size and associated traits such as oil content would help breeders develop varieties of increased oil yield that are more robust, easier to plant and , and better for oil processing. In this study, we developed a recombinant inbred population derived from the two camelina accessions, Suneson and Pryzeth, with contrasting traits, especially seed size and oil content. Using 189 lines, a genetic map was constructed containing 2376 single nucleotide polymorphism markers spanning 2034.6 cM of 20 linkage groups with an average density of 1.5 cM per locus. Field trials were conducted for 2 years (2017 and 2018) in two environments (dryland and irrigated) in Bozeman, Montana. The results revealed important correlations of seed size with other associated traits such as oil content, pod size and seed number per pod. Significant QTLs were also discovered for these traits. The results of this study are the first step to isolate genes controlling seed development and oil accumulation and to develop advanced varieties of camelina better adapted to modern agriculture by marker-assisted breeding.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31558736>Metal nanoparticles as effective promotors for Maize production.</a></h1><p>Zero-valent metal nanoparticles (Cu, Fe and Co) were prepared by the reactive method from their oxide with hydrogen.

Phototrophs have discovered clever strategies to  this light  and convert it to chemical  for biomass production. This is achieved in light-harvesting complexes, or antennas, that funnel the exciton  into the reaction centers. Antennas contain an array of chlorophylls, linear tetrapyrroles, and carotenoid pigments spatially controlled by neighboring proteins. This fine-tuned regulation of protein-pigment arrangements is crucial for survival in the conditions of both excess and extreme light deficit. Photomedicine and photodiagnosis have long been utilizing naturally derived and synthetic monomer dyes for imaging, photodynamic and photothermal therapy; however, the precise regulation of damage inflicted by these therapies requires more complex architectures. In this Account, we discuss how two mechanisms found in photosynthetic systems, photoprotection and light harvesting, have inspired scientists to create nanomedicines for more effective and precise phototherapies. Researchers have been recapitulating natural photoprotection mechanisms by utilizing carotenoids and other quencher molecules toward the design of photodynamic molecular beacons (PDT beacons) for disease-specific photoactivation. We highlight the seminal studies describing peptide-linked porphyrin-carotenoid PDT beacons, which are locally activated by a disease-specific enzyme. Examples of more advanced constructs include tumor-specific mRNA-activatable and polyionic cell-penetrating PDT beacons. An alternative approach toward harnessing photosynthetic processes for biomedical applications includes the design of various nanostructures. This Account will primarily focus on organic lipid-based micro- and nanoparticles. The phenomenon of nonphotochemical quenching, or excess  release in the form of heat, has been widely explored in the context of porphyrin-containing nanomedicines. These quenched nanostructures can be implemented toward photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy. Upon nanostructure disruption, as a result of tissue accumulation and subsequent cell uptake, activatable fluorescence imaging and photodynamic therapy can be achieved. Alternatively, processes found in nature for light harvesting under dim conditions, such as in the deep sea, can be harnessed to maximize light absorption within the tissue. Specifically, high-ordered dye aggregation that results in a bathochromic shift and increased absorption has been exploited for the collection of more light with longer wavelengths, characterized by maximum tissue penetration. Overall, the profound understanding of photosynthetic systems combined with rapid development of nanotechnology has yielded a unique field of nature-inspired photomedicine, which holds promise toward more precise and effective phototherapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31358960>Structural basis for  harvesting and dissipation in a diatom PSII-FCPII supercomplex.</a></h1><p>Light-harvesting antenna systems in photosynthetic organisms  solar  and transfer it to the photosynthetic reaction centres to initiate charge-separation and electron-transfer reactions. Diatoms are one of the important groups of oxyphototrophs and possess fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins (FCPs) as light harvesters. The organization and association pattern of FCP with the photosystem II (PSII) core are unknown. Here we solved the structure of PSII-FCPII supercomplexes isolated from a diatom, Chaetoceros gracilis, by single-particle cryoelectron microscopy. The PSII-FCPII forms a homodimer. In each monomer, two FCP homotetramers and three FCP monomers are associated with one PSII core. The structure reveals a highly complicated protein-pigment network that is different from the green-type light-harvesting apparatus. Comparing these two systems allows the identification of  transfer and quenching pathways. These findings provide structural insights into not only excitation- transfer mechanisms in the diatom PSII-FCPII, but also changes of light harvesters between the red- and green-lineage oxyphototrophs during evolution.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669989>Effect of Serratia sp.

This study investigated the potential of Serratia sp. K3 (K3) assisted with straw biogas residue (SBR) or leavening fertilizer (LF) on improving the Cd migration efficiency and micro-environment in soil-vetiveria zizanioides L. system. The results showed that the acid soluble Cd in soil was increased by 2.83-29.79% in treatments compared with control (CK). In addition, Cd accumulation in the roots and shoots of vetiveria zizanioides were significantly enhanced by the combination of K3 and SBR/LF. Especially, the translocation factor of Cd increased by 21.53-62.37% in groups with K3 compared with the groups without K3, correspondingly. Furthermore, SBR/LF effectively changed bacterial community structure, and improved bacterial abundance. Relative abundance of functional genes related with carbohydrate//amino acid metabolism were increased in groups of SBRB/LFB rhizosphere compared with CK. These results provide insight into the change of phytoremediation efficiency and soil bacterial communities in the vetiveria zizanioides rhizosphere after inoculation.

Grass is a potential lignocellulosic biomass which can be utilised for biorefinery-based bioethanol production. Grass biomass is a suitable feedstock for bioethanol production due to its all the year around production, requirement of less fertile land and noninterference with food system. However, the processes involved, i.e. pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation for bioethanol production from grass biomass, are both time consuming and costly. Developing the grass biomass in planta for enhanced bioethanol production is a promising step for maximum utilisation of this valuable feedstock and, thus, is the focus of the present review. Modern breeding techniques and transgenic processes are attractive methods which can be utilised for development of the feedstock. However, the outcomes are not always predictable and the time period required for obtaining a robust variety is generation dependent. Sophisticated genome editing technologies such as synthetic genetic circuits (SGC) or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) systems are advantageous for induction of desired traits/heritable mutations in a foreseeable genome location in the 1st mutant generation. Although, its application in grass biomass for bioethanol is limited, these sophisticated techniques are anticipated to exhibit more flexibility in engineering the expression pattern for qualitative and qualitative traits. Nevertheless, the fundamentals rendered by the genetics of the transgenic crops will remain the basis of such developments for obtaining biorefinery-based bioethanol concepts from grass biomass. Grasses which are abundant and widespread in nature epitomise attractive lignocellulosic feedstocks for bioethanol production. The complexity offered by the grass cell wall in terms of lignin recalcitrance and its binding to polysaccharides forms a barricade for its commercialization as a biofuel feedstock. Inspired by the possibilities for rewiring the genetic makeup of grass biomass for reduced lignin and lignin-polysaccharide linkages along with increase in carbohydrates, innovative approaches for in planta modifications are forging ahead. In this review, we highlight the progress made in the field of transgenic grasses for bioethanol production and focus our understanding on improvements of simple breeding techniques and post- techniques for development in shortening of lignin-carbohydrate and carbohydrate-carbohydrate linkages. Further, we discuss about the designer lignins which are aimed for qualitable lignins and also emphasise on remodelling of polysaccharides and mixed-linkage glucans for enhancing carbohydrate content and in planta saccharification efficiency. As a final point, we discuss the role of synthetic genetic circuits and CRISPR systems in targeted improvement of cell wall components without compromising the plant growth and health. It is anticipated that this review can provide a rational approach towards a better understanding of application of in planta genetic engineering aspects for designing synthetic genetic circuits which can promote grass feedstocks for biorefinery-based bioethanol concepts.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048842>Aspalathin, a natural product with the potential to reverse hepatic insulin resistance by improving  metabolism and mitochondrial respiration.</a></h1><p>Aspalathin is a rooibos flavonoid with established blood glucose lowering properties, however, its efficacy to moderate complications associated with hepatic insulin resistance is unknown. To study such effects, C3A liver cells exposed to palmitate were used as a model of hepatic insulin resistance. These hepatocytes displayed impaired substrate metabolism, including reduced glucose transport and free fatty acid uptake. These defects included impaired insulin signaling, evident through reduced phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase/ protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) protein expression, and mitochondrial dysfunction, depicted by a lower mitochondrial respiration rate. Aspalathin was able to ameliorate these defects by correcting altered substrate metabolism, improving insulin signaling and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Activation of 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) may be a plausible mechanism by which aspalathin increases hepatic  expenditure.

Power supply devices are an essential component of bioelectronics to ensure their robust performance. However, conventional power sources are usually bulky, rigid, and potentially contain hazardous constituent materials.

In developed countries and urban communities, photothermal membrane water treatment can improve the  efficiency during water purification. In these water purification processes, the light absorption and light-to-heat conversion of photothermal materials are important factors in determining the membrane efficacy. Nanomaterials with well-controlled structure and optical properties can increase the light absorption and photothermal conversion of newly developed membranes. This Account introduces our recent work on developing scalable, cost-effective, and highly efficient photothermal membranes for four water purification applications: reverse osmosis (RO), ultrafiltration (UF), solar steam generation (SSG), and photothermal membrane distillation (PMD). By utilizing photothermal materials, first, we have demonstrated how sunlight can be used to improve the membrane's resistance to biofouling in RO and UF processes by photothermally induced inactivation of microorganisms. Second, we have developed novel SSG membranes (i.e., interfacial evaporators) that can  solar , convert it to localized heat, and generate clean water by evaporation. This desalination approach is particularly useful and promising for treatment of highly saline water. These new interfacial evaporators utilized graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (RGO), molybdenum disulfide (MoS), and polydopamine (PDA). The solar conversion efficiency and environmental sustainability of the interfacial evaporators were optimized via (i) novel and versatile bottom-up biofabrication (e.g., incorporation of photothermal materials during bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) growth) and (ii) easy and cost-effective top-down preparation (e.g., modification of natural wood with photothermal materials). Third, we have developed membranes for PMD that incorporate photothermal materials to generate heat under solar irradiation, thus providing a higher transmembrane temperature difference and higher driving force for effective vapor transport, making the membrane distillation process more -efficient. Lastly, this Account compares the photothermal membrane applications, summarizes current challenges for photothermal membrane applications, and offers future directions to facilitate the translation of photothermal membranes from the laboratory to large engineered systems by improving their scalability, stability, and sustainability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148399>Dehulled small millets: The promising nutricereals for improving the nutrition of children.</a></h1><p>Good nutrition during a child's early years lays a strong foundation of health for the rest of its life. Yet in India, there is widespread prevalence of undernourishment among children below 5 years of age. Within the Indian context, small millets have great potential as a healthy food to address this challenge by the virtue of their nutritional qualities. However, there are many problems with the current processing technology for small millets, whereas the use of value-added products was minimal. To address this, an assessment of existing small millet processing machinery was undertaken, and a double chamber centrifugal dehuller was developed, which had higher recovery of dehulled unpolished millets and met requirements at the village and enterprise levels. To demonstrate the health benefits of consuming value-added small millets, a study of supplementation of multi-millet health mix on the nutritional status of primary schoolchildren was conducted in Thondamuthur Block of Coimbatore District, India. Multi-millet health mix was formulated from kodo millet, little millet, foxtail millet, finger millet, and wheat with the inclusion of pulses. It contained 65.45-g carbohydrate, 11.46-g protein, 4.94-g fat, 4.94-g fibre, 4.07-mg iron, 112-mg calcium, 268.52-mg phosphorus, and 349 calories of  per 100 g. The study indicated that there was a significant increase in height, weight, and haemoglobin level of the schoolchildren who regularly consumed the formulated multi-millet health mix.

By comparing the model organism  spp. and microorganisms respiring soluble TEA, we reason that a considerable part of the electron-transport chain of EAM performing direct EET does not contribute to the build-up of proton-motive force and thus, the anode potential does not co-determine the thermodynamic frame. Furthermore, using a modeling platform demonstrates that the influence of anode potential on   is solely a kinetic effect. When facing low anode potentials, NADH is accumulating due to a slow direct EET rate leading to a restricted exploitation of the thermodynamic frame. For anode potentials ≥ 0.2 V (vs. SHE), EET kinetics, NAD/NADH ratio as well as exploitation of the thermodynamic frame are maximized, and a further potential increase does not result in higher  . Considering the limited influence of the anode potential on   of EAM is a prerequisite to improve thermodynamic analyses, microbial resource mining, and to transfer microbial electrochemical technologies (MET) into practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31353729>Protective effects of a mixed plant extracts derived from Astragalus membranaceus and Laminaria japonica on PTU-induced hypothyroidism and liver damages.</a></h1><p>Protective effects of a mixed hot water extracts of Astragalus membranaceus (AWE) and Laminaria japonica (LWE), AWE: LWE 85:15 (g/g; AL mix), were investigated against propylthiouracil (PTU)-induced hypothyroidism in rats. Rats were challenged with PTU, resulting in, increased thyroid gland weight, decreased liver weight and antioxidant activities, reduced serum tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine levels with increased thyroid stimulating hormone levels, and elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase level. However, orally administered AL mix with 100, 200, and 400 mg kg  day , significantly inhibited such abnormalities, dose-dependently. Moreover, PTU-induced abnormal histological architecture of the rat thyroid gland and liver were also significantly ameliorated by an AL mix. The results suggested that, therapeutic use of AL mix for treating hypothyroidism can be characterized by its diversified active ingredients particularly iodine and ferulic acid as confirmed by phytochemical analyses. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The AL mix has synergistic effects in modulating thyroid hormone synthesis and preventing liver damages in PTU-induced hypothyroid rats. These effects of AL mix are mainly related to its richness specifically in iodine and ferulic acid. The growing interests of iodine and ferulic acid in AL mix are principally due to their beneficial effects in releasing sufficient thyroid hormones in hypothyroid conditions and promoting liver-protective functions through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potentials, respectively. Moreover, the results of AL mix are well-matched with the effects of standard drug levothyroxine in the present study. Therefore, appropriate dosage of AL mix will be promising as new medicinal food for preventing thyroid dysfunctions and its related liver damages.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122020>Harvesting Low-Grade Heat via Thermal-Induced Electric Double Layer Redistribution of Nanoporous Graphene Films.</a></h1><p>In this work, a closed thermoelectric cell based on a nanoporous graphene electrode is developed to convert low-grade thermal  to electric .

Here, we present a triboelectric nanogenerator that can work based on the interaction between two pure liquids. A liquid-liquid triboelectric nanogenerator is achieved by passing a liquid droplet through a freely suspended liquid membrane. We investigate two kinds of liquid membranes: a grounded membrane and a pre-charged membrane.

The basic idea is the conversion of light  into electrical  using photosynthetic microorganisms. The microbes will use their photosynthetic apparatus and the incoming light to split the water molecule. The generated protons and electrons are harvested using a bioelectrochemical system. The key challenge is the extraction of electrons from the microbial electron transport chains into a solid-state anode. On the cathode, a corresponding electrochemical counter reaction will consume the protons and electrons, e.g., through the oxygen reduction to water, or hydrogen formation. In this review, we are aiming to summarize the current state of the art and point out some limitations. We put a specific emphasis on cyanobacteria, as these microbes are considered future workhorses for photobiotechnology and are currently the most widely applied microbes in biophotovoltaics research. Current progress in biophotovoltaics is limited by very low current outputs of the devices while a lack of comparability and standardization of the experimental set-up hinders a systematic optimization of the systems. Nevertheless, the fundamental questions of redox homeostasis in photoautotrophs and the potential to directly  light  from a highly efficient photosystem, rather than through oxidation of inefficiently produced biomass are highly relevant aspects of biophotovoltaics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160951>Photon upconversion utilizing  beyond the band gap of crystalline silicon with a hybrid TES-ADT/PbS quantum dots system.</a></h1><p>The recent introduction of inorganic semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) as triplet sensitizers for molecular semiconductors has led to significant interest in harvesting low  photons, which can then be used for photon upconversion (PUC),  triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA). A key goal is the harvesting of photons from below the bandgap of crystalline silicon 1.12 eV (≈1100 nm) and their upconversion into the visible region. In practice, the systems demonstrated so far have been limited to harvesting photons with energies above 1.2 eV (≈1 μm), due to two reasons: firstly the need to use transmitter ligands which allow efficient  harvesting from the QD but introduce an  loss of larger than 200 meV in transmission from the QD to the annihilator, and secondly due to the use of molecules such as tetracene which cannot accept smaller  than 1.2 eV. Here, we introduce a new strategy to overcome these difficulties by using a low  triplet annihilator that also harvests excitations efficiently from QDs. Specifically, we show that 5,11-bis(triethylsilylethynyl)anthradithiophene (TES-ADT, triplet  of 1.08 eV:  1150 nm) functions as a triplet annihilator (20% TTA efficiency) while also rapidly extracting triplet excitons from lead sulfide (PbS) QDs with a rate constant of  =  2 × 10 s with an excitation at 1064 nm. This rate is consistent with an orbital overlap between TES-ADT and PbS QDs, which we propose is due to the thiophene group of TES-ADT, which enables a close association with the PbS surface, allowing this system to function both as annihilator and transmitter. Our results pave the way for the design of triplet annihilators that can closely associate with the QD surface and  low  excitons with minute losses in  during the TET process, with the ultimate goal of efficiently utilizing photon  beyond the bandgap of crystalline silicon.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569566>Experimental In-Field Transfer and Survival of  from Animal Feces to Romaine Lettuce in Salinas Valley, California.</a></h1><p>This randomized controlled trial characterized the transfer of  from animal feces and/or furrow water onto adjacent heads of lettuce during foliar irrigation, and the subsequent survival of bacteria on the adaxial surface of lettuce leaves.

Foliar irrigation can transfer  from feces located in a furrow onto adjacent heads of lettuce, likely due to the kinetic  of irrigation droplets impacting the fecal surface and/or impacting furrow water contaminated with feces, with the magnitude of  enumerated per head of lettuce influenced by the distance between lettuce and the fecal deposit, cumulative application of foliar irrigation, wind aspect of lettuce relative to feces, and time since final irrigation.

Scientific evidence on nutritional adequacy of predominant complementary foods is critical for planning and prioritising interventions. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the quality of complementary foods and the optimality of complementary feeding practices in Southwest Ethiopia.In this cross-sectional study, a stratified multistage sampling procedure was used to sample 433 children, 6-24 months old. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect demographic, socio-economic and dietary data. Dietary diversity score was measured using a 24-h dietary recall. Six customary complementary food types were assayed for proximate composition,  and mineral density using standard methods. Adequacy of the complementary foods in nutrients for complementary feeding purposes was assessed as a ratio between actual composition and recommended composition of complementary foods.Only 16.1% of the children get the minimum dietary diversity. The children were reported to be fed with cereals & grains (68.8%), discretionary calories (53.6%), protein-rich foods (44.6%), oils and fat (40.5%), vegetables (38.5%), dairy products (17.9%) and fruits (28.1%). The sampled foods contained 4.3-24.4%, 0.9-8.5%, 8.2-11.9%, 27.9-162.6 Kcal/100 g, 168.4-250.4 mg/100 g, 1.8-4.1 mg/100 g and 22.5-42.4 mg/100 g of total carbohydrate, crude fat, protein,  content, calcium, zinc and iron, respectively. All the complementary food samples predominantly fed to children were not composed of adequate protein, fat, carbohydrate,  and calcium as recommended for complementary feeding purposes. However, most of the complementary foods are composed of adequate iron and zinc.The nutrient density and diversity of complementary foods of 6-24-month-old children in the study area were found to be sub-optimal.

Oxygenic photosynthesis is often cited as the most important microbial innovation-the emergence of oxygen-evolving photosynthesis, aided by geologic events, is credited with tipping the scale from a reducing early Earth to an oxygenated world that eventually lead to complex life. Anoxygenic photosynthesis predates oxygen-evolving photosynthesis and played a key role in developing and fine-tuning the photosystem architecture of modern oxygenic phototrophs. The release of oxygen as a by-product of metabolic activity would have caused oxidative damage to anaerobic microbiota that evolved under the anoxic, reducing conditions of early Earth. Photosynthetic machinery is particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of oxygen and reactive oxygen species and these effects are compounded by light. As a result, phototrophs employ additional detoxification mechanisms to mitigate oxidative stress and have evolved alternative oxygen-dependent enzymes for chlorophyll biosynthesis. Phylogenetic reconstruction studies and biochemical characterization suggest photosynthetic reactions centers, particularly in Cyanobacteria, evolved to both increase efficiency of electron transfer and avoid photodamage caused by chlorophyll radicals that is acute in the presence of oxygen. Here we review the oxygen and reactive oxygen species detoxification mechanisms observed in extant anoxygenic and oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria as well as the emergence of these mechanisms over evolutionary time. We examine the distribution of phototrophs in modern systems and phylogenetic reconstructions to evaluate the emergence of mechanisms to mediate oxidative damage and highlight changes in photosystems and reaction centers, chlorophyll biosynthesis, and niche space in response to oxygen production. This synthesis supports an emergence of HS-driven anoxygenic photosynthesis in Cyanobacteria prior to the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and underscores a role for the former metabolism in fueling fine-tuning of the oxygen evolving complex and mechanisms to repair oxidative damage. In contrast, we note the lack of elaborate mechanisms to deal with oxygen in non-cyanobacterial anoxygenic phototrophs suggesting these microbes have occupied similar niche space throughout Earth's history.Copyright © 2019 The Author.

Their atomic thickness and large-scale synthesis capability could enable the development of 'smart skin', which could transform ordinary objects into an intelligent distributed sensor network. However, although many important components of such a distributed electronic system have already been demonstrated (for example, transistors, sensors and memory devices based on two-dimensional materials), an efficient, flexible and always-on -harvesting solution, which is indispensable for self-powered systems, is still missing. Electromagnetic radiation from Wi-Fi systems operating at 2.4 and 5.9 gigahertz is becoming increasingly ubiquitous and would be ideal to  for powering future distributed electronics. However, the high frequencies used for Wi-Fi communications have remained elusive to radiofrequency harvesters (that is, rectennas) made of flexible semiconductors owing to their limited transport properties. Here we demonstrate an atomically thin and flexible rectenna based on a MoS semiconducting-metallic-phase heterojunction with a cutoff frequency of 10 gigahertz, which represents an improvement in speed of roughly one order of magnitude compared with current state-of-the-art flexible rectifiers. This flexible MoS-based rectifier operates up to the X-band (8 to 12 gigahertz) and covers most of the unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical radio band, including the Wi-Fi channels. By integrating the ultrafast MoS rectifier with a flexible Wi-Fi-band antenna, we fabricate a fully flexible and integrated rectenna that achieves wireless  harvesting of electromagnetic radiation in the Wi-Fi band with zero external bias (battery-free). Moreover, our MoS rectifier acts as a flexible mixer, realizing frequency conversion beyond 10 gigahertz.

Herein, we have synthesized Ti-C micro particles based on the template-assisted method and subsequently integrated with oxidized carbon nanofiber (f-CNF) through ultrasonication technique. The prepared Ti-C/f-CNF composite was subjected to various structural and morphological characterization techniques including the X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM),  Dispersive X-ray (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The all followed studies confirmed the formation and crystalline nature of prepared Ti-C/f-CNF nanocomposite. Further, the proposed Ti-C/f-CNF composite modified electrode was successfully applied as an electrocatalyst for the electrochemical detection of diphenylamine (DPA) in food. DPA is known as an anti-scald agent used to post  treatment of fruits. However, the higher concentration of DPA causes some hazardous side effects to human. Thus, the detection of DPA is an important concern in healthcare research. Eventually, the proposed Ti-C/f-CNF/SPCE exhibited ultra-low detection limit of (0.003 μM) with a linear range of 0.04-56.82 μM towards the detection of DPA. Moreover, the practicability of the proposed sensor was tested by real sample analysis by using fresh apple extract. Remarkably, the proposed sensor showed an excellent recovery range from 106.8% to 108% for the detection of DPA in spiked apple extract. Finally, we concluded that the integration of f-CNF with Ti-C is significantly enhanced both electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic activity for sensor application.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, field surveys were conducted in the western highlands of Kenya with viral symptomatic leaf samples collected. Subsequently, next-generation sequencing was carried out to gain insights into the molecular evolution and evolutionary relationships of Bean common mosaic necrosis virus (BCMNV) and Cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus (CABMV) present within symptomatic common bean and cowpea. Eleven near-complete genomes of BCMNV and two for CABMV were obtained from western Kenya. Bayesian phylogenomic analysis and tests for differential selection pressure within sites and across tree branches of the viral genomes were carried out. Three well-supported clades in BCMNV and one supported clade for CABMNV were resolved and in agreement with individual gene trees. Selection pressure analysis within sites and across phylogenetic branches suggested both viruses were evolving independently, but under strong purifying selection, with a slow evolutionary rate. These findings provide valuable insights on the evolution of BCMNV and CABMV genomes and their relationship to other viral genomes globally.

In the present study, 4‑week‑old C57BL6 mice were orally administrated with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) or normal saline (control) 4 weeks prior to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). A subset of the mice were sacrificed at 24 h post‑CLP, and the others were used for survival studies. Ileum tissues, blood and fecal samples were collected. The survival rate of septic mice pretreated with LGG was significantly improved compared with untreated mice. The levels of inflammatory cytokines were reduced in LGG‑pretreated septic mice. A decrease of colonic proliferation and epithelial tight junctions and an increase of colonic apoptosis were observed in control septic CLP+saline mice. LGG pretreatment reversed the colonic proliferation, apoptosis and expression of tight junction proteins to the levels of the sham group. LGG pretreatment improved the richness and diversity of intestinal microbiota in septic mice. The principal coordinates analysis clustering plots revealed a significant separate clustering in microbiota structure between three groups. Bacteria associated with  consumption, including Bacteroidetes, with opportunistic infection, including Proteobacteria, Staphylococcaceae and Enterococcaceae, lipopolysaccharide producers, including Enterobacteriaceae, and facultative anaerobes, such as Bacteroidaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae, increased in septic mice. By contrast, bacteria associated with  , including Firmicutes, intestinal barrier function regulators, including Akkermansia, hepatic function regulators, including Coprococcus and Oscillospira, and obligate anaerobes, including Prevotellaceae, decreased in septic mice. With LGG pretreatment, the sepsis‑induced microbiota dysbiosis was reversed. The present results elucidated the potential mechanism of LGG treatment in sepsis, by improving intestinal permeability and modulating microbiota dysbiosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30838713>Management intensification maintains wood production over multiple harvests in tropical Eucalyptus plantations.</a></h1><p>Plantation forestry, in which trees are grown as a crop, must maintain wood production over repeated  cycles (rotations) to meet global wood demands on a limited land area. We analyze 33 yr of Landsat observations across the world's most productive forestry system, Eucalyptus plantations in southeastern Brazil, to assess long-term regional trends in wood production. We apply a simple algorithm to time series of the vegetation index NIRv in thousands of Eucalyptus stands to detect the starts and ends of rotations. We then estimate wood production in each identified stand and rotation, based on a statistical relationship between NIRv trajectories and inventory data from three plantation companies. We also compare Eucalyptus NIRv with that of surrounding native vegetation to assess the relative influence of management and environment on plantation productivity trends. Across more than 3,500 stands with three complete rotations between 1984 and 2016, modeled wood volume decreased significantly between the first and second rotation, but recovered at least partially in the third; mean wood volumes for the three rotations were 262, 228, and 247 m /ha. This nonlinear trend reflects intensifying plantation management, as rotation length decreased by an average of 15% (decreasing wood volume per rotation) and NIRv proxies of tree growth rates increased (increasing volume) between the first and third rotation. However, NIRv also increased significantly over time in unmanaged vegetation around the plantations, suggesting that environmental trends affecting all vegetation also contribute to sustaining wood production. Management inputs will likely continue to be important for maintaining wood production in future harvests.© 2019 by the Ecological Society of America.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31489888>Bidirectional Piezoelectric  Harvester.</a></h1><p>This paper represents a numerical and experimental investigation of the bidirectional piezoelectric  harvester.

The first mass is placed at a free end of the harvester while the second mass is fixed at the joining point of the cantilevers. The piezoelectric  harvester employs the first and the second out of plane bending modes.

We used genetic engineering to improve mineral micronutrient concentrations in cassava. Overexpression of the Arabidopsis thaliana vacuolar iron transporter VIT1 in cassava accumulated three- to seven-times-higher levels of iron in transgenic storage roots than nontransgenic controls in confined field trials in Puerto Rico. Plants engineered to coexpress a mutated A. thaliana iron transporter (IRT1) and A. thaliana ferritin (FER1) accumulated iron levels 7-18 times higher and zinc levels 3-10 times higher than those in nontransgenic controls in the field. Growth parameters and storage-root yields were unaffected by transgenic fortification in our field data. Measures of retention and bioaccessibility of iron and zinc in processed transgenic cassava indicated that IRT1 + FER1 plants could provide 40-50% of the EAR for iron and 60-70% of the EAR for zinc in 1- to 6-year-old children and nonlactating, nonpregnant West African women.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31345411>Trichoderma/pathogen/plant interaction in pre- food security.</a></h1><p>Large losses before crop harvesting are caused by plant pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, oomycetes, fungi, and nematodes. Among these, fungi are the major cause of losses in agriculture worldwide. Plant pathogens are still controlled through application of agrochemicals, causing human disease and impacting environmental and food security. Biological control provides a safe alternative for the control of fungal plant pathogens, because of the ability of biocontrol agents to establish in the ecosystem. Some Trichoderma spp. are considered potential agents in the control of fungal plant diseases. They can interact directly with roots, increasing plant growth, resistance to diseases, and tolerance to abiotic stress. Furthermore, Trichoderma can directly kill fungal plant pathogens by antibiosis, as well as via mycoparasitism strategies. In this review, we will discuss the interactions between Trichoderma/fungal pathogens/plants during the pre- of crops. In addition, we will highlight how these interactions can influence crop production and food security. Finally, we will describe the future of crop production using antimicrobial peptides, plants carrying pathogen-derived resistance, and plantibodies.Copyright © 2019 British Mycological Society.

PBSs consist of highly ordered assemblies of pigmented phycobiliproteins (PBPs) and linker proteins that can account for up to half of the soluble protein in cells. Cyanobacteria adjust to changing environmental conditions by modulating PBS size and number. In response to nutrient depletion such as nitrogen (N) deprivation, PBSs are degraded in an extensive, tightly controlled, and reversible process. In  UTEX 2973, a fast-growing cyanobacterium with a doubling time of two hours, the process of PBS degradation is very rapid, with 80% of PBSs per cell degraded in six hours under optimal light and CO conditions. Proteomic analysis during PBS degradation and re-synthesis revealed multiple proteoforms of PBPs with partially degraded phycocyanobilin (PCB) pigments. NblA, a small proteolysis adaptor essential for PBS degradation, was characterized and validated with targeted mass spectrometry. NblA levels rose from essentially 0 to 25,000 copies per cell within 30 min of N depletion, and correlated with the rate of decrease in phycocyanin (PC). Implications of this correlation on the overall mechanism of PBS degradation during N deprivation are discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31107488>Thermally driven homonuclear-stacking phase of MoS through desulfurization.</a></h1><p>Engineering phase transitions or finding new polymorphs offers tremendous opportunities for developing functional materials. We reveal that the thermally driven desulfurization of single-crystalline MoS2 samples improves transport properties by reducing the band gap and further induces metallization. Semi-desulfurization, i.e., removal of the topmost S layer, results in the placement of the exposed Mo layers directly on top of the following sub-layers, together with the bottom S layer of the top layer. This homonuclear (AA) stacking derived from the AA' stacking of the hexagonal (2H) phase is retained even after further desulfurization of the remaining bottom S layer, i.e., full desulfurization of the top layer. Our findings fundamentally explain why the 2H phase of TMDs is characterized by AA' stacking.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31370294>Comparative Grain Yield, Straw Yield, Chemical Composition, Carbohydrate and Protein Fractions, In Vitro Digestibility and Rumen Degradability of Four Common Vetch Varieties Grown on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.</a></h1><p>Four varieties of common vetch, including three improved varieties (Lanjian No. 1, Lanjian No. 2, and Lanjian No. 3) and one local variety (333A), were evaluated for varietal variations in grain yield, straw yield and straw quality attributes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Crops were harvested at pod maturity to determine grain yield, straw yield,  index, and potential utility index (PUI). Straw quality was determined by measuring chemical composition, carbohydrate and protein fractions, in vitro gas production and in situ ruminal degradability. Results showed a significant effect ( < 0.01) of variety on the grain yield [875.2-1255 kg dry matter (DM)/ha], straw yield (3154-5556 kg DM/ha),  index (15.6-28.7%) and PUI (53.3-63.2%). Variety also had a significant effect on chemical composition, carbohydrate and protein fractions ( < 0.05) except non-structural carbohydrates and rapidly degradable sugars. Significant differences ( < 0.05) were observed among the varieties in potential gas production [188-234 mL/g DM], in vitro organic matter (OM) digestibility (43.7-54.2% of OM), and metabolizable  (6.40-7.92 MJ/kg DM) of straw. Significant differences ( < 0.001) were also observed among the varieties in rapidly degradable DM fraction and effective DM degradability of straw; however, no difference was observed in other DM degradation parameters and neutral detergent fiber degradation parameters. In conclusion, based on straw yield and quality, Lanjian No. 1 has the greatest potential among the tested varieties as a crop for supplementing ruminant diets for smallholder farmers on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31458970>Toward a Rapid-Fabricated Triboelectric Device with a 1,3-Phosphorylated Poly(vinyl alcohol) Polymer for Water Turbulence  Harvesting.</a></h1><p>Electricity generation from coal, nuclear reaction, and shale gas has brought environmental, safety, and health concerns.

The full range of visible color of NBSF could be realized by depositing one-dimensional nano-multilayers of alternating high-index (AlO) and low-index (SiO) films while controlling the thickness of each layer and the number of stacked layers. Particularly, high-purity red, green, and blue (RGB) colors were generated on black CIGSSe cells with minimal  efficiency drop, showing power conversion efficiency (PCE) losses for the red and green CIGSSe cells of 4.2 and 1.2%, respectively, with no reduction in the PCE of the blue CIGSSe cell. The minimal drop in the  efficiency was attributed to the antireflection effect of the NBSF and the low overlap between the reflectance spectrum of NBSFs with a narrow stopband and the absorption spectrum of CIGSSe. The esthetic value could be further enhanced through the color variation of the RGB NBSF with viewing angle, so-called pearl-like colors. The synergetic effect of minimal efficiency loss, full color realization, and the pearl-like color change of the newly developed NBSFs can make CIGSSe cells applicable to building-integrated photovoltaics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336029>Photothermal Conversion Material Derived from Used Cigarette Filters for Solar Steam Generation.</a></h1><p>Solar steam generation by photothermal materials has recently emerged as a new and feasible approach to effectively  solar  in a variety of applications. This work reports an efficient heat localization material based on the renewable cellulose acetate cigarette filters and a reduced graphene oxide coating (RGO-CF) as the light-to-heat conversion layer for solar steam generation. RGO-CF possessed an aligned structure with superhydrophilic nature, lower thermal conductivity (0.0733 Wm  K ), and broad light adsorption (≈100 %). These characteristics enable rapid water transportation and excellent light-to-heat conversion by the resulting RGO-CF with an  conversion efficiency of 94 % under stimulated solar illumination (1 kW m ), which demonstrates that RGO-CF is a promising photothermal conversion material for solar steam generation. Such strategy for preparation of photothermal materials not only reduces the fabrication cost but also provides a fundamental guidance for the practical application of renewable polymer resources from used cigarette filters.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In recent years, the -harvesting triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has attracted increasing attentions due to its sustainability, flexibility, and versatility. However, achieving both high electric output and flexibility at the same time remains to be a challenge. In this work, we reported a corona charging enhanced flexible triboelectric nanogenerator (EF-TENG) to  mechanical  from human motions. The EF-TENG relied on the repeated contacts between a poly(tetrafluoroethylene)/poly(dimethylsiloxane) nanocomposite electret and a nanofibers/AgNWs electrode on arrayed silicone pyramids. When the EF-TENG (3.5 × 3.5 cm) was pressed, the open-circuit voltage ( V), the short-circuit current ( I), and the power density could reach 275 V, 9.5 μA, and 802.31 mW/m, respectively. The V of the EF-TENG was improved by 244% compared to the device of which the electret was not corona charged. Major factors that affected the electric output of the EF-TENG were discussed, including the height of the pyramids, the configuration of the pyramids array, and the properties of the electret nanocomposite.

Trapping for adults was conducted in Italy with novel live (or lethal) traps consisting of aggregation pheromone-baited cylinders with a wind vane, with the upwind end covered by mesh and the downwind end sealed by a removable entry-only mesh cone, admitting the attracted bugs. The novel traps caught up to 15-times more adult  than identically-baited sticky panels in two weeks of daily checking (n = 6 replicates) (the new live traps were, in Run 1, 5-, 9-, 15-, 13-, 4-, 12-, 2-fold; and in Run 2, 7-, 1-, 3-, 7-, 6-, 6-, and 5-fold better than sticky traps, daily). The maximum catch of the new traps was 96 live adults in one trap in 24 h and the average improvement was ~7-fold compared with sticky panels. The rotating live traps, which exploit a mesh funnel facing the plume downwind that proved useful for collecting adults, could also be used to kill bugs. We expect that commercially-available traps could replace the crude prototypes we constructed quickly from local materials, at low cost, as long as the principles of a suitable plume structure were observed, as we discuss. The traps could be useful for the sterile insect technique, supporting rearing colonies, or to kill bugs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30795502>Electrostatic MEMS Vibration  Harvesters inside of Tire Treads.</a></h1><p>An electret electrostatic MEMS vibration  harvester for tire sensors mounted inside of the tire tread is reported.

In this paper, a novel structure with an oblique microrod array is employed to fabricate a high-performance textile-based wearable triboelectric nanogenerator (WTNG). The contact area of WTNGs can be efficiently enhanced when the oblique poly(dimethylsiloxane) microrods are forced to bend uniformly and slide along one direction during the working condition. The oblique microrod structure enables the WTNG to generate a short-circuit current density and an open-circuit voltage reaching 3.24 μA/cm and 1014.2 V, respectively. The maximum peak power density of a WTNG reached 211.7 μW/cm. Meanwhile, 48 red light-emitting diodes were simultaneously lit up by tapping a WTNG. Furthermore, the WTNG can be dressed on an elbow to continuously   from human motions as a sustainable power source. This work develops an efficient approach for enhancing the output performance of triboelectric nanogenerators and paves a promising way to power wearable electronics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30851631>Maturation of the respiratory complex II flavoprotein.</a></h1><p>Respiratory complexes are complicated multi-subunit cofactor-containing machines that allow cells to   from the environment. Maturation of these complexes requires protein folding, cofactor insertion, and assembly of multiple subunits into a final, functional complex. Because the intermediate states in complex maturation are transitory, these processes are poorly understood. This review gives an overview of the process of maturation in respiratory complex II with a focus on recent structural studies on intermediates formed during covalent flavinylation of the catalytic subunit, SDHA. Covalent flavinylation has an evolutionary significance because variants of complex II enzymes with the covalent ligand removed by mutagenesis cannot oxidize succinate, but can still perform the reverse reaction and reduce fumarate. Since succinate oxidation is a key step of aerobic respiration, the covalent bond of complex II appears to be important for aerobic life.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Reverse electrodialysis is one of the most efficient and mature techniques that can  this  from natural estuaries produced by the mixture of seawater and river water. For this, the development of cheap and suitable ion-exchange membranes is crucial for a  profitability  from salinity gradients. In this work, both anion-exchange membrane and cation-exchange membrane based on poly(epichlorohydrin) and polyvinyl chloride, respectively, were synthesized at a laboratory scale (255 c m ) by way of a solvent evaporation technique. Anion-exchange membrane was surface modified with poly(ethylenimine) and glutaraldehyde, while cellulose acetate was used for the cation exchange membrane structural modification. Modified cation-exchange membrane showed an increase in surface hydrophilicity, ion transportation and permselectivity. Structural modification on the cation-exchange membrane was evidenced by scanning electron microscopy. For the modified anion exchange membrane, a decrease in swelling degree and an increase in both the ion exchange capacity and the fixed charge density suggests an improved performance over the unmodified membrane. Finally, the results obtained in both modified membranes suggest that an enhanced performance in blue  generation can be expected from these membranes using the reverse electrodialysis technique.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791597>Analyzing Power Beacon Assisted Transmission with Imperfect CSI in Wireless Powered Sensor Networks.</a></h1><p>This paper proposes the maximal ratio transmission (MRT) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) protocols for the power beacon (PB) assisted wireless powered sensor networks and analyzes the impact of the imperfect channel state information (CSI) on the performance using the Markov chain theory. The wireless powered sensor chooses to transmit information to the destination or   from the PB when its  can or cannot supply a transmission, respectively.

We also optimize the sensor transmit power to maximize the overall ergodic capacity. Our results reveal that the transmit probability and the effective ergodic capacity can be greatly improved with increasing the number of antennas at the PB and the destination, and can also be significantly degraded by decreasing the channel correlation factors.

Magneto-photoluminescence studies reveal that the triplet-to-singlet conversion in exciplexes involves an artificially generated spin-orbital coupling (SOC). The photoinduced electron parametric resonance measurements indicate that the intermolecular charge-transfer occurs with forming electric dipoles (D →A ), providing the ionic polarization to generate SOC in exciplexes. By having different singlet-triplet  differences (ΔE ) in 9,9'-diphenyl-9H,9'H-3,3'-bicarbazole (BCzPh):3',3'″,3'″″-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tris(([1,1'-biphenyl]-3-carbonitrile)) (CN-T2T) (ΔE = 30 meV) and BCzPh:bis-4,6-(3,5-di-3-pyridylphenyl)-2-methyl-pyrimidine (B3PYMPM) (ΔE = 130 meV) exciplexes, the SOC generated by the intermolecular charge-transfer states shows large and small values (reflected by different internal magnetic parameters: 274 vs 17 mT) with high and low external quantum efficiency maximum, EQE (21.05% vs 4.89%), respectively. To further explore the cooperative relationship of spin, , and polarization parameters, different photoluminescence wavelengths are selected to concurrently change SOC, ΔE , and polarization while monitoring delayed fluorescence. When the electron clouds become more deformed at a longer emitting wavelength due to reduced dipole (D →A ) size, enhanced SOC, increased orbital polarization, and decreased ΔE can simultaneously occur to cooperatively operate the triplet-to-singlet conversion.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In recent years, coral health has been severely impacted by environmental stressors brought on by human activity and climate change, threatening the extinction of several major reef ecosystems. Reef damage is mediated by a process called 'coral bleaching' where corals, sea anemones, and other cnidarians lose their photosynthetic algal symbionts (family Symbiodiniaceae) upon stress induction, resulting in drastically decreased host   and, ultimately, coral death. The mechanism by which this critical cnidarian-algal symbiosis is lost remains poorly understood. The larvae of the sea anemone, Exaiptasia pallida (commonly referred to as 'Aiptasia') are an attractive model organism to study this process, but they are large (∼100 mm in length, ∼75 mm in diameter), deformable, and highly motile, complicating long-term imaging and limiting study of this critical endosymbiotic relationship in live organisms. Here, we report 'Traptasia', a simple microfluidic device with multiple traps designed to isolate and image individual, live larvae of Aiptasia and their algal symbionts over extended time courses. Using a trap design parameterized via fluid flow simulations and polymer bead loading tests, we trapped Aiptasia larvae containing algal symbionts and demonstrated stable imaging for >10 hours. We visualized algae within Aiptasia larvae and observed algal expulsion under an environmental stressor. To our knowledge, this device is the first to enable time-lapsed, high-throughput live imaging of cnidarian larvae and their algal symbionts and, in further implementation, could provide important insights into the cellular mechanisms of cnidarian bleaching under different environmental stressors. The 'Traptasia' device is simple to use, requires minimal external equipment and no specialized training to operate, and can easily be adapted using the trap optimization data presented here to study a variety of large, motile organisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31539198>Near-Infrared-Driven Photocatalysts: Design, Construction, and Applications.</a></h1><p>Photocatalysts, which utilize solar  to catalyze the oxidation or reduction half reactions, have attracted tremendous interest due to their great potential in addressing increasingly severe global  and environmental issues.

Moench] is a viable alternative to corn silage (Zea mays L.) in double cropping rotations with forage winter cereals in New York due to a later planting date and potentially earlier  date of forage sorghum than is typical for corn silage. Our objective was to determine whether  of brachytic dwarf brown midrib forage sorghum can take place before the currently recommended soft dough  time while maintaining dry matter (DM) yield, forage nutritive value, and total mixed ration performance. Seven trials were conducted on 2 research farms in central New York from 2014 to 2017. Forage sorghum received 1 of 2 fertilizer N rates at planting (112 and 224 kg of N/ha). Stands were harvested at boot, flower, milk, and soft dough stages. Forage samples were analyzed for nutritive value and substituted for corn silage in a typical dairy total mixed ration at varying amounts using the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System. Timing of  affected yield and forage nutritive value for each individual trial and across trials, and the effects were independent of N fertilizer application rate. Averaged across trials, yield ranged from 10.7 Mg of DM/ha for the boot stage to 13.5, 15.2, and 15.8 Mg of DM/ha for the flower, milk, and soft dough stages, respectively. For individual trials, yield either remained constant with  beyond the flower stage (4 trials), or beyond the milk stage (1 trial), whereas for 2 trials yield increased up to the soft dough stage. At the later  stages, DM, starch, and nonfiber carbohydrates were increased, whereas crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and 30-h neutral detergent fiber digestibility were decreased. Without adjusting for DM intake, substitution of corn silage by forage sorghum harvested at the soft dough stage resulted in stable predicted metabolizable  allowable milk, whereas the reduced starch content of earlier harvested sorghum resulted in less metabolizable  allowable milk with greater substitution of corn silage for sorghum. Forage sorghum can be harvested as early as the flower or milk stage without losing DM yield, allowing for timely planting of forage winter cereal in a double cropping rotation. However,  supplementation in the diet is needed to make up for reduced starch concentrations with  of sorghum at flower and milk growth stages.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Microbial oxidation in unsaturated soils is the only known biological process that removes CH from the atmosphere, but so far, bacteria that can grow on atmospheric CH have eluded all cultivation efforts. In this study, we have isolated a pure culture of a bacterium, strain MG08 that grows on air at atmospheric concentrations of CH [1.86 parts per million volume (p.p.m.v.)]. This organism, named , is globally distributed in soils and closely related to uncultured members of the upland soil cluster α.

However, growth on ambient air was also confirmed for  and , close relatives with a lower specific affinity for CH, suggesting that the ability to utilize atmospheric CH for growth is more widespread than previously believed. The closed genome of  MG08 encodes a single particulate methane monooxygenase, the serine cycle for assimilation of carbon from CH and CO, and CO fixation via the recently postulated reductive glycine pathway. It also fixes dinitrogen and expresses the genes for a high-affinity hydrogenase and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, suggesting that atmospheric CH oxidizers  additional  from oxidation of the atmospheric trace gases carbon monoxide (0.2 p.p.m.v.) and hydrogen (0.5 p.p.m.v.).Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis was applied to assess differences in the transcript levels of genes associated with mannitol metabolism under low-temperature stress. A mannitol solution was added to cultures of  fruiting bodies, and effects on the hypothermic resistance of these organs were explored by evaluating variations in sensory properties during cryogenic storage after . The results suggested that in the initial stage of low-temperature treatment, intracellular mannitol was largely catabolized as an  storage material and the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in synthetic reactions was inhibited. However, low-temperature resistance was induced with further treatment, with activation of mannitol synthesis and inhibition of degradation; the cells accumulated mannitol, leading to osmoregulation. No significant elongation of  fruiting bodies during storage at 4°C was observed, and these organs tended to shrink and collapse.

Although this improves optical device operating spectral range and efficiency, e.g., solar cells, typical UC material conversion efficiency is too low for practical devices. We propose a cross-patterned slot waveguide constructed from UC material embedded in a high index semiconductor layer to improve UC. Since the slot waveguide mode is induced in the low index UC slot, NIR absorption (~970 nm) increased 25-fold compared with film structures. Furthermore, the spontaneous emission enhancement rate at 660 nm increased 9.6-fold compared to the reference film due to resonance excited in the UC slot (Purcell effect). Thus, the proposed UC slot array structure improved UC efficiency 240-fold considering absorption and emission enhancements.

Soil NO fluxes were recorded every 2 weeks using static chambers starting from preconversion in April 2016 and continuing until the end of October 2017. Monthly soil samples were also taken and analysed for nitrate and ammonium. There was no significant difference in NO emissions between the different cultivation methods. However, in comparison with the uncultivated pasture, NO emissions from the cultivated  plots were 550%-819% higher in the first year (April to December 2016) and 469%-485% higher in the second year (January to October 2017). When added to an estimated carbon cost for production over a 10 year crop lifetime (including crop management, , and transportation), the measured NO conversion cost of 4.13 Mg CO-eq./ha represents a 44% increase in emission compared to the base case. This paper clearly shows the need to incorporate NO fluxes during  establishment into assessments of GHG balances and life cycle analysis and provides vital knowledge needed for this process.

Lignocellulosic biomass composition differs depending on several factors, such as plant age,  date, organ type, and genotype. Here, four selected  genotypes (, ,  × ,  ×  hybrid) were grown and harvested, separated into stems and leaves, and characterized for their non-starch polysaccharide composition and structures, lignin contents and structures, and hydroxycinnamate profiles (monomers and ferulic acid dehydrodimers). Polysaccharides of all genotypes are mainly composed of cellulose and low-substituted arabinoxylans. Ratios of hemicelluloses to cellulose were comparable, with the exception of  that showed a higher hemicellulose/cellulose ratio. Lignin contents of  stems were higher than those of  leaves. Considering the same organs, the four genotypes did not differ in their Klason lignin contents, but  ×  showed the highest acetylbromide soluble lignin content. Lignin polymers isolated from stems varied in their S/G ratios and linkage type distributions across genotypes. -Coumaric acid was the most abundant ester-bound hydroxycinnamte monomer in all samples. Ferulic acid dehydrodimers were analyzed as cell wall cross-links, with 8-5-coupled diferulic acid being the main dimer, followed by 8-O-4-, and 5-5-diferulic acid.

Following this target, different calcium carbonate-titania nanostructures were prepared by three different pathways using available raw materials such as limestone as calcium precursor. After characterization of the prepared materials with X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) patterns, Fourier transmission infrared (FT-IR), high resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM), N adsorption-desorption isotherm, UV-vis diffuse reflectance and photoluminance (PL), the materials were applied as novel photocatalysts for desulfurization of dibenzothiophene (DBT) and gas oil using different radiation sources at room temperature. It has been obtained that, 95% desulfurization of DBT was possible under 1 h visible light irradiation with linear halogen lamp (LHL) at catalyst/DBT-solution = 10 g/L, while ultra-clean diesel production (99% removal, 3.47 ppm) could be obtained via normal sunlight photochemical desulfurization of diesel fuel by calcium carbonate titania photocatalyst in presence of HO and acetic acid as oxidizing agents and acetonitrile as a solvent. Here, the followed preparation pathway produced highly active calcium titanate photocatalysts with tunable band gap  (2.05 eV), reduced electrons/hole pairs recombination and stable photocatalytic activity with enhanced visible light removal of organosulfur compounds for economic ultra-clean fuel production, pollution control, and environmental management.Copyright © 2019.

The bcc α-FeMn films are a ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature between 650 K and 750 K, which do not exist in nature can be manipulated through the tensile strain. In this study, γ-FeMn epitaxial films grown on GaAs(001) using molecular beam epitaxy are found to structural transition from the face-centered-cubic (fcc, a = 0.327 nm) γ-phase to the body-centered-cubic (bcc, a = 0.889 nm) α-phase. For α-FeMn epitaxial films, ferromagnetism is accompanied by structural phase transition due to the tensile strain induced by the differences of the thermal expansion between the film and the substrate. Moreover, by realizing in epitaxial films with fcc structure a tensile strain state, phase transitions were introduced Fe-Mn alloy system with bcc structure. These findings are of fundamental importance to understanding the mechanism of phase transition and properties of epitaxial CuAu-I type antiferromagnetic alloy thin films under strain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474111>Rapid Water Harvesting and Nonthermal Drying in Humid Air by N-Doped Graphene Micropads.</a></h1><p>We demonstrate a novel nanotextured graphene micropad that can rapidly  water from air to generate microscale water droplets with the desired size in designated positions on demand by simply applying a negative electric bias of -1.5 to -15 V. More interestingly, the water droplets can be reversibly dried nonthermally with the pad at ambient temperature in humid air (∼85% RH) by applying a positive electric bias of +1.5 to +15 V. The harvesting and drying rates on the glass are 2.7 and 1.5 μm/s under biases of -15 and +15 V, respectively, but no apparent harvesting or drying activities are observed without the bias. The  consumption is minimal as there is no Joule current due to the insulative substrate. It is shown that substrate wettability and ions play an important role in enabling the fast water harvesting and nonthermal drying. Molecular modeling is developed to understand the harvesting and drying mechanisms at the atomic scale.

Baseline population estimates, against which future observations may be compared, are necessary if we are to detect ecological change. Arctic sea ice ecosystems are changing rapidly and we lack baseline population estimates for many ice-associated species. Provided we can detect them, changes in Arctic marine ecosystems may be signaled by changes in indicator species such as ringed seals (Pusa hispida). Ringed seal monitoring has provided estimates of survival and fertility rates, but these have not been used for population-level inference. Using matrix population models, we synthesized existing demographic parameters to obtain estimates of historical ringed seal population growth and structure in Amundsen Gulf and Prince Albert Sound, Canada. We then formalized existing hypotheses about the effects of emerging environmental stressors (i.e., earlier spring ice breakup and reduced snow depth) on ringed seal pup survival. Coupling the demographic model to ice and snow forecasts available from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project resulted in projections of ringed seal population size and structure up to the year 2100. These projections showed median declines in population size ranging from 50% to 99%. Corresponding to these projected declines were substantial changes in population structure, with increasing proportions of ringed seal pups and adults and declining proportions of juveniles. We explored if currently collected, -based data could be used to detect the projected changes in population stage structure. Our model suggests that at a present sample size of 100 seals per year, the projected changes in stage structure would only be reliably detected by mid-century, even for the most extreme climate models. This modeling process revealed inconsistencies in existing estimates of ringed seal demographic rates. Mathematical population models such as these can contribute both to understanding past population trends as well as predicting future ones, both of which are necessary if we are to detect and interpret future observations.© 2019 by the Ecological Society of America.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30682099>Tolerance and dose-response assessment of subchronic dietary ethoxyquin exposure in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.).</a></h1><p>Ethoxyquin (EQ; 6-Ethoxy-2,2,4-trimethyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline) has been used as an antioxidant in feed components for pets, livestock and aquaculture. However, possible risks of EQ used in aquafeed for fish health have not yet been characterized. The present study investigated the toxicity and dose-response of subchronic dietary EQ exposure at doses ranging from 41 to 9666 mg EQ/kg feed in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Feed at concentrations higher than 1173 mg EQ/kg were rejected by the fish, resulting in reduced feed intake and growth performance. No mortality was observed in fish exposed to any of the doses. A multi-omic screening of metabolome and proteome in salmon liver indicated an effect of dietary EQ on bioenergetics pathways and hepatic redox homeostasis in fish fed concentrations above 119 mg EQ/kg feed. Increased  expenditure associated with an upregulation of hepatic fatty acid β-oxidation and induction and carbohydrate catabolic pathways resulted in a dose-dependent depletion of intracytoplasmic lipid vacuoles in liver histological sections, decreasing whole body lipid levels and altered purine/pyrimidine metabolism. Increased GSH and TBARS in the liver indicated a state of oxidative stress, which was associated with activation of the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response and glutathione-mediated detoxification processes. However, no oxidative DNA damage was observed. As manifestation of altered  metabolism, the depletion of liver intracytoplasmic lipid vacuoles was considered the critical endpoint for benchmark dose assessment, and a BMDL10 of 243 mg EQ/kg feed was derived as a safe upper limit of EQ exposure in Atlantic salmon.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309158>Leaf-inspired multiresponsive MXene-based actuator for programmable smart devices.</a></h1><p>Natural leaves, with elaborate architectures and functional components,  and convert solar  into chemical fuels that can be converted into  based on photosynthesis.

The alloy NCs were synthesized by a high-temperature hot injection method and subsequently characterized through high photoluminescence quantum yield, along with larger size compared to binary NCs. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements revealed long-lived charge carriers in the alloy structure due to more structural rigidity and less defect states. Finally, the solar-cell efficiencies of the CdZnS (CdZnSe) NCs were found to be 3.05 % (3.69 %) as compared to 1.23 % (3.12 %) efficiencies for CdS (CdSe) NCs.

However, there are still several barriers that make a global deployment of the IoT difficult. One of these issues is the  dependence, normally limited by the capacitance of the batteries. A promising solution to provide  autonomy to the IoT nodes is to  residual  from ambient sources, such as motion, vibrations, light, or heat. Mechanical  can be converted into electrical  by using piezoelectric transducers. The piezoelectric generators provide an alternating electrical signal that must be rectified and, therefore, needs a power management circuit to adapt the output to the operating voltage of the IoT devices. The bonding and packaging of the different components constitute a large part of the cost of the manufacturing process of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and integrated circuits. This could be reduced by using a monolithic integration of the generator together with the circuitry in a single chip. In this work, we report the optimization, fabrication, and characterization of a vibration-driven piezoelectric MEMS  harvester, and the design and simulation of a charge-pump converter based on a standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Finally, we propose combining MEMS and CMOS technologies to obtain a fully integrated system that includes the piezoelectric generator device and the charge-pump converter circuit without the need of external components.

Hallmarks of male puberty are an increased proliferation activity in the testis and elevated androgen production. Examining transcriptional changes in salmon testis during the transition from immature to maturing testes may help understanding the regulation of puberty, potentially leading to procedures to modulate its start. Since differences in body weight influence, via unknown mechanisms, the chances for entering puberty, we used two feed rations to create body weight differences.Maturing testes were characterized by an elevated proliferation activity of Sertoli cells and of single undifferentiated spermatogonia. Pituitary gene expression data suggest increased Gnrh receptor and gonadotropin gene expression, potentially responsible for the elevated circulating androgen levels in maturing fish. Transcriptional changes in maturing testes included a broad variety of signaling systems (e.g. Tgfβ, Wnt, insulin/Igf, nuclear receptors), but also, activation of metabolic pathways such as anaerobic metabolism and protection against ROS. Feed restriction lowered the incidence of puberty. In males maturing despite feed restriction, plasma androgen levels were higher than in maturing fish receiving the full ration. A group of 449 genes that were up-regulated in maturing fully fed fish, was up-regulated more prominently in testis from fish maturing under caloric restriction. Moreover, 421 genes were specifically up-regulated in testes from fish maturing under caloric restriction, including carbon metabolism genes, a pathway relevant for nucleotide biosynthesis and for placing epigenetic marks.Undifferentiated spermatogonia and Sertoli cell populations increased at the beginning of puberty, which was associated with the up-regulation of metabolic pathways (e.g. anaerobic and ROS pathways) known from other stem cell systems. The higher androgen levels in males maturing under caloric restriction may be responsible for the stronger up-regulation of a common set of (449) maturation-associated genes, and the specific up-regulation of another set of (421) genes. The latter opened regulatory and/or metabolic options for initiating puberty despite feed restriction. As a means to reduce the incidence of male puberty in salmon, however, caloric restriction seems unsuitable.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590126>Adipose tissue as a possible therapeutic target for polyphenols: A case for Cyclopia extracts as anti-obesity nutraceuticals.</a></h1><p>Obesity is a significant contributor to increased morbidity and premature mortality due to increasing the risk of many chronic metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer. Lifestyle modifications such as  restriction and increased physical activity are highly effective first-line treatment strategies used in the management of obesity. However, adherence to these behavioral changes is poor, with an increased reliance on synthetic drugs, which unfortunately are plagued by adverse effects. The identification of new and safer anti-obesity agents is thus of significant interest. In recent years, plants and their phenolic constituents have attracted increased attention due to their health-promoting properties. Amongst these, Cyclopia, an endemic South African plant commonly consumed as a herbal tea (honeybush), has been shown to possess modulating properties against oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and obesity. Likewise, several studies have reported that some of the major phenolic compounds present in Cyclopia spp. exhibit anti-obesity effects, particularly by targeting adipose tissue. These phenolic compounds belong to the xanthone, flavonoid and benzophenone classes. The aim of this review is to assess the potential of Cyclopia extracts as an anti-obesity nutraceutical as underpinned by in vitro and in vivo studies and the underlying cellular mechanisms and biological pathways regulated by their phenolic compounds.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, PZT nanofiber-based nanogenerators were fabricated to test their true piezoelectric performance without the triboelectric effect. Aligned PZT nanofibers were fabricated by a sol-gel electrospinning process. The thickness, area, and orientation of the PZT textile made by electrospinning a PZT solution onto multipair metal wires or metal mesh were controlled to form a composite textile. After the calcination, the PZT textile mixed with polydimethylsiloxane was placed between two flexible indium-doped tin oxide-polyethylene naphthalate substrates. The performance parameters of the nanogenerators were investigated under the bending motion, which excludes the triboelectric effect. An assembled nanogenerator of an area of 8 cm and a thickness of 80 μm could generate an electrical output voltage of 1.1 V and a current of 1.4 μA under the bending strain. The piezoelectric voltage depended on the thickness of the PZT textile, whereas the piezoelectric current depended on both the thickness and the area of the PZT textile. The electrical performance of the device was significantly affected by the orientation of the PZT fiber and the bending direction. The output voltage and the output current were strain-dependent, whereas the total integrated charge was independent of the strain rate. The properties of the flexible nanogenerator could be quantified to verify the pure piezoelectric performance of the device.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015331>Phycobilisomes Harbor FNR in Cyanobacteria.</a></h1><p>Cyanobacterial phycobilisomes (PBSs) are photosynthetic antenna complexes that  light  and supply it to two reaction centers (RCs) where photochemistry starts. PBSs can be classified into two types, depending on the presence of allophycocyanin (APC): CpcG-PBS and CpcL-PBS. Because the accurate protein composition of CpcL-PBS remains unclear, we describe here its isolation and characterization from the cyanobacterium  sp. strain 6803. We found that ferredoxin-NADP oxidoreductase (or FNR), an enzyme involved in both cyclic electron transport and the terminal step of the electron transport chain in oxygenic photosynthesis, is tightly associated with CpcL-PBS as well as with CpcG-PBS. Room temperature and low-temperature fluorescence analyses show a red-shifted emission at 669 nm in CpcL-PBS as a terminal  emitter without APC. SDS-PAGE and quantitative mass spectrometry reveal an increased content of FNR and CpcC2, a rod linker protein, in CpcL-PBS compared to that of CpcG-PBS rods, indicative of an elongated CpcL-PBS rod length and its potential functional differences from CpcG-PBS. Furthermore, we combined isotope-encoded cross-linking mass spectrometry with computational protein structure predictions and structural modeling to produce an FNR-PBS binding model that is supported by two cross-links between K of FNR and the N terminus of CpcB, one component in PBS, in both CpcG-PBS and CpcL-PBS (cross-link 1), and between the N termini of FNR and CpcB (cross-link 2). Our data provide a novel functional assembly form of phycobiliproteins and a molecular-level description of the close association of FNR with phycocyanin in both CpcG-PBS and CpcL-PBS. Cyanobacterial light-harvesting complex PBSs are essential for photochemistry in light reactions and for balancing  flow to carbon fixation in the form of ATP and NADPH. We isolated a new type of PBS without an allophycocyanin core (i.e., CpcL-PBS). CpcL-PBS contains both a spectral red-shifted chromophore, enabling efficient  transfer to chlorophyll molecules in the reaction centers, and an increased FNR content with various rod lengths. Identification of a close association of FNR with both CpcG-PBS and CpcL-PBS brings new insight to its regulatory role for fine-tuning light  transfer and carbon fixation through both noncyclic and cyclic electron transport.Copyright © 2019 Liu et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30837821>Seasonality in associations between dietary diversity scores and nutrient adequacy ratios among pregnant women in rural Malawi - a cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>Dietary diversity scores (DDS) are simple indicators often used as proxies for nutrient adequacy. A 10-food group indicator is proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations as a global standard for measuring dietary diversity among women in low-resource settings. However, its validity as a proxy for nutrient adequacy across different agricultural seasons for pregnant women has not been determined.We studied associations between DDS and nutrient adequacy ratios (NAR) across two different agricultural seasons (pre- and post- seasons) for pregnant women in rural Malawi and assessed whether a 1-day DDS or a 3-day DDS would be the best indicator of nutrient adequacy.Dietary intakes of 330 pregnant women were assessed between gestational weeks 28 and 35. Intakes of , macronutrients, and 11 micronutrients were estimated using three repeated interactive 24-h diet recalls, and DDS were also calculated from these days. Correlation coefficients () between DDS, NAR, and mean adequacy ratio (MAR) of the 11 micronutrients were determined.After  adjustments, we found significant correlations between DDS and MAR with both DDS indicators in the preharvest season ( = 0.22-0.23;  < 0.001) but not in the post- season ( > 0.05). For individual -adjusted NARs, correlations were not consistently significant across the two seasons and the two DDS indicators.Our results suggest that DDS could be used to predict overall nutrient adequacy during the preharvest season. As similar correlations were found using both the 1- and 3-day indicators, we recommend using a 1-day DDS, for simplicity. However, as the indicators are sensitive to seasonality they should be used with care in this study setting.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30952934>The Blue-Green Sensory Rhodopsin SRM from Haloarcula marismortui Attenuates Both Phototactic Responses Mediated by Sensory Rhodopsin I and II in Halobacterium salinarum.</a></h1><p>Haloarchaea utilize various microbial rhodopsins to  light  or to mediate phototaxis in search of optimal environmental niches.

As we head into a new era of civilization, population increase and modernized lifestyles have led to an increasing need for water, , and food. However, severe hydrological precipitation significantly impacts agricultural , and such influence becomes more apparent under the influence of climate change. Meanwhile, the major method of electricity generation (i.e., fossil fuel burning) has a negative impact on the environment. These inevitable threats are crucial and have to be dealt with for a society on the road towards sustainability. In the present study, an integrated evaluation of the WEF nexus was conducted for two areas with different levels of urbanization using empirical multiple linear regression in a simultaneous equation model (SEM). By incorporating the collected data into the SEM, the weighting coefficient of each identified variable was obtained, and the nexus implication was assessed in model simulation at different scenarios considering the population growth, agro-technology advancement,  structure improvement, and available water resources. In the simulated results, three observations were found: (1) the rural area is more sustainable than the urban one; (2) the sustainability for both the investigated areas is significantly subject to their water supply and demand; and (3) food production was found to have a less important effect on the sustainable development of the urban area. This study identified the key factors in the WEF nexus exploration, which are economically and environmentally important for resource allocation. An empirical model was developed to correlate sustainable achievement with WEF management, as well as strategic policies that should be implemented under the pressure of urbanization.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31510486>Optimization of Light Management Layers for Light  of Perovskite Solar Cells.</a></h1><p>Recently, with rapid development of perovskite solar cells, the record efficiency has exceeded 24.2%. However, the research of efficiency improvement never stops. This work introduces an effective approach to remarkably reduce the device reflection loss by using light management (LM) cover layer. A specific model combined with ray and wave optics was built to numerically optimize the texture of the LM layers for light harvesting in photovoltaics cells and explore the optical principles in the light trapping. The LM layer texture is made of 2D periodic triangle structures. Both symmetric and asymmetric triangle structures were investigated. The results indicate that asymmetric structures possess the close performance compared with symmetric ones, and notably, on contrary to the symmetric structures, the light trapping abilities are much more insensitive to the bottom thicknesses of asymmetric structures. It will benefit the practical fabrication, since the precise bottom thickness control can be avoided. From the optimization results, 3 optimal structures are found. With the optimal LM layers, a thin active layer (165nm) device is able to produce the short circuit current intensities (Jsc) of around 21mA/cm, which is approximately equivalent to the Jsc of a thick active layer (800nm) device without LM layers. Meanwhile, about 23% power conversion efficiency (PCE) enhancement is achieved. On the other hand, active layer thickness also makes influence on the light trapping abilities. As the active layer thickness is increased from 165nm to 800nm, the Jsc only improves by about 2.4mA/cm, while the PCE enhancement is dropped from ~23% to ~11%. In consideration of the compromise between total device  output and PCE enhancement, as well as material cost reduction, the active layer with around 165nm should be an optimal thickness.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31275045>Effects of air temperature before  on the concentration of human adiponectin in transgenic strawberry fruits.</a></h1><p>Transgenic ever-bearing strawberry (× Duch.

We investigated the effects of air temperature before  on fruit growth and the concentration of human adiponectin (hAdi) at  in transgenic strawberry. During the different stages of maturity (mature white and immature green stages), hAdi-expressing plants were exposed to four air temperature treatments (15, 20, 25, and 30°C) under 24-h illumination provided by fluorescent lamps. Fruits were harvested at the mature red stage. The number of days to the mature red stage decreased with increasing air temperature, being the least at 30°C. Fruit total soluble protein (TSP) concentration increased with decreasing air temperature, particularly at 15°C, whereas fruit hAdi concentration tended to be higher under the 30°C treatment than under any other of the temperature treatments. There was no significant relationship between fruit fresh weight at  time and hAdi concentration within treatments, nor between the number of days to  and hAdi or TSP concentration. Although there were no significant differences in fruit hAdi content among treatments, hAdi production rate was the highest at 30°C because of the shortest duration to . These results indicate that a higher air temperature promoted fruit maturation and accelerated the production of functional hAdi proteins in the fruit. For hAdi-expressing strawberry plants, exposure to 30°C may reduce  consumption (lighting and air conditioning) for functional protein production under controlled environments.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31265242>Methylammonium Lead Iodide Incorporated Poly(vinylidene fluoride) Nanofibers for Flexible Piezoelectric-Pyroelectric Nanogenerator.</a></h1><p>This work introduces a piezoelectric-pyroelectric nanogenerator (P-PNG) based on methylammonium lead iodide (CHNHPbI) incorporated electrospun poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofibers that are able to  mechanical and thermal energies. During the application of a periodic compressive contact force at a frequency of 4 Hz, an output voltage of ∼220 mV is generated. The P-PNG has a piezoelectric coefficient () of ∼19.7 pC/N coupled with a high durability (60 000 cycles) and quick response time (∼1 ms). The maximum generated output power density (∼0.8 mW/m) is sufficient to charge up a variety of capacitors, with the potential to replace an external power supply to drive portable devices. In addition, upon exposure to cyclic heating and cooling at a temperature of 38 K, a pyroelectric output current of 18.2 pA and a voltage of 41.78 mV were achieved. The fast response time of 1.14 s, reset time of 1.25 s, and pyroelectric coefficient of ∼44 pC/m K demonstrate a self-powered temperature sensing capability of the P-PNG. These characteristics make the P-PNG suitable for flexible piezoelectric-pyroelectric  harvesting for self-powered electronic devices.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982122>Quantifying Ecological Integrity of Terrestrial Systems to Inform Management of Multiple-Use Public Lands in the United States.</a></h1><p>The concept of ecological integrity has been applied widely to management of aquatic systems, but still is considered by many to be too vague and difficult to quantify to be useful for managing terrestrial systems, particularly across broad areas. Extensive public lands in the western United States are managed for diverse uses such as timber , livestock grazing,  development, and wildlife conservation, some of which may degrade ecological integrity. We propose a method for assessing ecological integrity on multiple-use lands that identifies the components of integrity and levels in the ecological hierarchy where the assessment will focus, and considers existing policies and management objectives. Both natural reference and societally desired environmental conditions are relevant comparison points. We applied the method to evaluate the ecological integrity of shrublands in Nevada, yielding an assessment based on six indicators of ecosystem structure, function, and composition, including resource- and stressor-based indicators measured at multiple scales. Results varied spatially and among indicators. Invasive plant cover and surface development were highest in shrublands in northwest and southeast Nevada. Departure from reference conditions of shrubland area, composition, patch size, and connectivity was highest in central and northern Nevada. Results may inform efforts to control invasive species and restore shrublands on federal lands in Nevada. We suggest that ecological integrity assessments for multiple-use lands be grounded in existing policies and monitoring programs, incorporate resource- and stressor-based metrics, rely on publicly available data collected at multiple spatial scales, and quantify both natural reference and societally desired resource conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31424904>Plasmon-Driven Catalysis on Molecules and Nanomaterials.</a></h1><p>As a new class of photocatalysts, plasmonic noble metal nanoparticles with the unique ability to  solar  across the entire visible spectrum and produce effective  conversion have been explored as a promising pathway for the  crisis. The resonant excitation of surface plasmon resonance allows the nanoparticles to collect the  of photons to form a highly enhanced electromagnetic field, and the  stored in the plasmonic field can induce hot carriers in the metal. The hot electron-hole pairs ultimately dissipate by coupling to phonon modes of the metal nanoparticles, resulting in a higher lattice temperature. The plasmonic electromagnetic field, hot electrons, and heat can catalyze chemical reactions of reactants near the surface of the plasmonic metal nanoparticles. This Account summarizes recent theoretical and experimental advances on the excitation mechanisms and  transfer pathways in the plasmonic catalysis on molecules. Especially, current advances on plasmon-driven crystal growth and transformation of nanomaterials are introduced. The efficiency of the chemical reaction can be dramatically increased by the plasmonic electromagnetic field because of its higher density of photons. Similar to traditional photocatalysis,  overlap between the plasmonic field and the HOMO-LUMO gap of the reactant is needed to realize resonant  transfer. For hot-carrier-driven catalysis, hot electrons generated by plasmon decay can be transferred to the reactant through the indirect electron transfer or direct electron excitation process. For this mechanism, the  of hot electrons needs to overlap with the unoccupied orbitals of the reactant, and the particular chemical channel can be selectively enhanced by controlling the  distribution of hot electrons. In addition, the local thermal effect following plasmon decay offers an opportunity to facilitate chemical reactions at room temperature. Importantly, surface plasmons can not only catalyze chemical reactions of molecules but also induce crystal growth and transformation of nanomaterials. As a new development in plasmonic catalysis, plasmon-driven crystal transformation reveals a more powerful aspect of the catalysis effect, which opens the new field of plasmonic catalysis. We believe that this Account will promote clear understanding of plasmonic catalysis on both molecules and materials and contribute to the design of highly tunable catalytic systems to realize crystal transformations that are essential to achieve efficient solar-to-chemical  conversion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415924>Subtopic: Advances in water and wastewater treatment harvesting of Chlorella sp. microalgae using Aspergillus niger as bio-flocculant for aquaculture wastewater treatment.</a></h1><p>Microalgae have been increasingly used to generate biofuel, thus a sustainable technique should be implemented to  the biomass to ensure its existence in the environment. Aspergillus niger was used as bio-flocculant to  microalgae from aquaculture wastewater via flocculation technique over a range of pH and mixing rate. The bio-flocculant showed ability to adapt at a wide range of pH from 3.0 to 9.0 and at a mixing rate of 100-150 rpm, producing a harvesting efficiency of higher than 90%. The treated water possessed low concentration of chlorophyll-a (0.3-0.6 mg L) and cell density (2 × 10-3 × 10 cell mL). These indicate that Aspergillus niger is a promising bio-flocculant to be used in harvesting microalgae, thus promoting the use of flocculation as a green technology in aquaculture wastewater treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The electronic, optical, and charge transport properties were studied using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) approaches. The parameters such as energetic driving force Δ , adiabatic ionization potential , and adiabatic electron affinity  were also calculated at the same level. The calculated results show that the introduction of different groups to the side of DPP backbones in the star-shaped molecules can tune the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs)  of the designed molecules. The designed molecules can provide match well with those of typical acceptors PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) and PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester). Additionally, the absorption wavelengths of the designed molecules show bathochromic shifts compared with that of the original molecule, respectively. The introduction of different groups can extend the absorption spectrum toward longer wavelengths, which is beneficial to  more sunlight. The calculated reorganization energies suggest that the designed molecules are expected to be the promising candidates for ambipolar charge transport materials except molecule with benzo[c]isothiazole group can be used as hole and electron transport material. Moreover, the different substituent groups do not significantly affect the stability of the designed molecules.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650556>Canopy reflectance, stalk sugar and juice yields in specialty corn hybrids as affected by nitrogen management strategies.</a></h1><p>The newly developed sugarcorn is conceived for dual-purpose use as a potential biofuel feedstock and a high- silage crop. Its agronomic traits are, however, not fully appraised under the umbrella of nitrogen (N) management and with canopy reflectance indicator. A three-year field study was conducted to examine the responses of silage biomass, stalk sugar concentration, sugar and juice yields to various N applications; and determine the quantitative relationships between canopy reflectance, expressed as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and stalk sucrose or other sugar measures in a dual-purpose sugarcorn (cv. 'CO384xC103'), in comparison with a commercial leafy silage-specific hybrid (cv. 'Pride A5892G3 EDF').The moderate N rate, 125 kg ha , produced similar stalk sucrose, silage and grain yields, compared to the high rate (250 kg N ha ), regardless of application methods. The NDVI signatures measured at the V8-10 stage exhibited significant (p < 0.01) and exponential relationships with stalk sucrose concentrations, sucrose and juice yields at the R3 stage, and with silage yield at approximately 65% whole-plant moisture, the optimum silage- window.The results indicate that the moderate N rate, 125 kg ha , which is recommended for conventional grain corn production in the region, was likely close to the economic optimum N rate for leafy silage-specific and sugarcorn. Canopy reflectance, measured at the early growth stages, can be used as a potential indicator of sugar and silage production, and this quantitative relationship necessitates further evaluation with more genotypes and under wide environmental conditions.

In higher plants and most eukaryotic algae, the PSII core is surrounded by variable numbers of light-harvesting antenna complex II (LHCII), forming a PSII-LHCII supercomplex. In order to   efficiently at low-light-intensity conditions under water, a complete PSII-LHCII supercomplex (CSMN) of the green alga  (Cr) contains more antenna subunits and pigments than the dominant PSII-LHCII supercomplex (CSM) of plants. The detailed structure and  transfer pathway of the Cr-PSII-LHCII remain unknown. Here we report a cryoelectron microscopy structure of a complete, CSMN-type PSII-LHCII supercomplex from  at 3.37-Å resolution. The results show that the Cr-CSMN supercomplex is organized as a dimer, with 3 LHCII trimers, 1 CP26, and 1 CP29 peripheral antenna subunits surrounding each PSII core. The N-LHCII trimer partially occupies the position of CP24, which is present in the higher-plant PSII-LHCII but absent in the green alga. The M trimer is rotated relative to the corresponding M trimer in plant PSII-LHCII. In addition, some unique features were found in the green algal PSII core.

Feasibility of mixed culture as an inoculum in BES is mainly restricted by methanogenic population. Methanogens compete with electrogens (in bioanodes) or acetogens (in biocathodes) for substrate which results in diminishing Coulombic efficiency. Selection of particular inoculum pretreatment method affects the microbial diversity in anodic/cathodic microenvironments and hence the performance of BES. This review discusses various physical, chemical and biological pretreatment methods for suppressing the growth of methanogens. Selective microbial enrichment in anodic/cathodic biofilm can be promoted with bioaugmentation and/or applied external potential approach to  maximum Coulombs from the substrate. For field application of BES, physical pretreatment methods can be proposed with intermittent addition of chemical inhibitors and conversion of methane to electricity in order to make the process inexpensive along with recovering the maximum .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

These changes can influence the quality and quantity of forage for herbivores that rely on early-seral plants. To evaluate how management of forested landscapes might affect nutrition for Shiras moose (A. a. shirasi) at large spatial scales, we focused on shrubs and evaluated summer diet composition, forage availability, and forage quality across 21 population management units encompassing >36,000 km2 in northern Idaho, USA. We identified 17 shrub species in the diets of moose, 11 of which comprised the bulk of the diets. These forage shrubs varied markedly in both  (mean digestible  for leaves ranged from 9.62 to 12.89 kJ/g) and protein (mean digestible protein for leaves ranged from 1.73 to 7.90%). By adapting established field sampling methods and integrating recent advances in remote sensing analyses in a modeling framework, we predicted approximations of current and past (i.e., 1984) quantities of forage shrubs across northern Idaho. We also created a qualitative index of population trend for moose across population management units using  data. Predicted quantities of forage shrubs varied widely across the study area with generally higher values at more northern latitudes. The quantity of forage shrubs was estimated to have declined over the past 30 years in about half of the population management units, with the greatest declines predicted for high- forage species. The population trend index was correlated with the percent change in availability of moderate- forage shrubs, indicating that availability of forage shrubs and change in availability over time might be affecting population dynamics for moose in northern Idaho. Our study highlights the importance of assessing how changes in forest management across broad spatiotemporal extents could affect wildlife and their habitats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31256885>Glucose and Insulin Response of Horses Grazing Alfalfa, Perennial Cool-Season Grass, and Teff Across Seasons.</a></h1><p>Elevated nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) values in pasture forages can cause adverse health effects in some horses (Equus caballus L.). The objectives of this study were to determine the impact of different forage species on blood glucose and insulin concentrations of horses throughout the grazing season. Research was conducted in July (summer) and September (fall) in St. Paul, MN. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), mixed perennial cool-season grasses (CSG), and teff (Eragrostis tef [Zucc.] Trotter) pastures were grazed by six horses (24 ± 2 years) that were randomly assigned to one of three forage types in a replicated Latin-square design. Jugular catheters were inserted 1 hour before the start of grazing and horses had access to pasture each day from 08:00 to 16:00 hours. Jugular venous blood samples were collected from each horse before being turned out (0 hours) and then at 2-hour intervals following turnout. Plasma and serum samples were collected and analyzed for glucose and insulin, respectively. Corresponding forage samples were taken by hand . Seasons were analyzed separately and data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure in SAS with P ≤ .05. Teff generally had lower (P ≤ .05) equine digestible , crude protein, and NSC compared to the other forages. Differences in peak insulin were observed between horses grazing CSG and teff during the fall grazing (P ≤ .05). These results suggest grazing teff could lower the glucose and insulin response of some horses.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Photoactivatable surfaces that can generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species under exposure to ambient light is a promising approach to inactivation of surface-borne microorganisms. There is growing interest in the use of quantum dots (QDs) as light-harvesting agents for photobactericidal applications, but the cadmium in commonly used QDs will restrict clinical application. Herein, the photobactericidal activity of novel polyurethane substrates containing cadmium-free QDs was tested against clinical multidrug-resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and a carbapenemase-producing strain of Escherichia coli ( E. coli). To enhance the capacity for reactive oxygen species generation, QDs were incorporated into the polymer with a photosensitizing dye, crystal violet. Close proximity between the QD and dye enables electron and  transfer processes leading to generation of cytotoxic singlet oxygen and superoxide radicals. A QD solution in cyclohexane was premixed with a solution of CV in the more polar solvent, dichloromethane, to promote the formation of QD-CV nanocomposite complexes via CV adsorption. This solution was then used to embed the QDs and crystal violet into medical grade polyurethane via swell-encapsulation. The combination of QD and CV elicited significant synergistic antibacterial activity under visible light against MRSA within 1 h (99.98% reduction) and E. coli within 4 h (99.96% reduction). Photoluminescence lifetime and singlet oxygen phosphorescence measurements demonstrated that interaction between the QDs and the crystal violet occurs within the polymer and leads to enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species. Strong inhibition of kill was observed using the superoxide scavenger, superoxide dismutase. The efficacy of these QD-CV polymer substrates, that can  light across the visible spectrum, against multidrug-resistant bacteria demonstrates the feasibility of this approach.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31229103>Riboflavin applications to grapevine leaves and berries blue-light post- treatments modifies grape anthocyanins and amino acids contents.</a></h1><p>Light is an  source and key environmental factor for plants. Out of the different light wavelengths, blue-light is one of the most relevant spectral regions because of its relation to anthocyanins biosynthesis. Among the compounds present in grapes, anthocyanins determine their main organoleptic and healthy properties; while a minimum concentration of ammonium and amino acids is necessary for a desirable development of the alcoholic fermentation. Moreover, amino acids are precursors of several volatile compounds synthetized during the fermentation. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of riboflavin (vitamin B2) applications, at  and one week later,to grapevine leaves in combination with post- blue-light irradiation on Tempranillo (Vitis vinifera L.) grape anthocyanins and amino acidscomposition. The combination of blue-light irradiation and two riboflavin doses as well as theseindividual factors affected both grape anthocyanins and amino acidsconcentrations. After one week of storage, anthocyanins concentration diminished when clusters were irradiated with blue-light; while for amino acids content, the trend to increase or decrease is dependent on the riboflavin dose applied in vines and the storage time.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, in 2014, alternative ready-to-use foods were developed. This trial aimed to assess the acceptability of the novel ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF) as a snack or mixed with borbor (white rice porridge), compared with corn-soy blend plus plus (CSB++) and borbor fortified with micronutrient powder (MNP). The nonblinded, randomised 4 × 4 crossover trial recruited 95 children aged 9-23 months from communities in peri-urban Phnom Penh. Small quantities (100 g for porridges, 42 g for snack) of each food were offered for three consecutive days at testing sites (homes of health volunteers). Main outcomes were children's consumption, caregivers' assessment of children's preferences, and caregivers' ranking of the foods. Median percentage consumed of the test food servings ranged from 21 to 50% (p = 0.003). The odds of children consuming over 50% were greatest for borbor fortified with MNP versus RUSF snack (unadjusted OR = 6.79, CI = 2.80-16.47, p < 0.001). However, the median  children received when consuming the RUSF with borbor (57 kcals) or as a snack (48 kcals) was greater than with CSB++ (15 kcals) or borbor fortified with MNP (18 kcals; p < 0.001). Therefore, although children ate less RUSF, it provided approximately three times more kilocalories. Caregivers reported that their children had the highest preference for borbor fortified with MNP. Caregivers themselves ranked the novel RUSF snack highest. Thus, the innovative RUSF was considered sufficiently acceptable to proceed to an effectiveness trial.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30738259>Corn stover  N and  budgets in central Iowa.</a></h1><p>Harvesting corn stover removes N from the fields, but its effect on subsurface drainage and other N losses is uncertain. We used the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) to examine N losses with 0 (NRR) or 50% (RR) corn residue removal within a corn and soybean rotation over a 10-yr period. In general, all simulations used the same pre-plant or post-emergence N fertilizer rate (200 kg ha yr). Simulated annual corn yields averaged 10.7 Mg ha for the post emergence applications (NRRpost and RRpost), and 9.5 and 9.4 Mg ha yr for NRRpre and RRpre. Average total N input during corn years was 19.3 kg N ha greater for NRRpre compared to RRpre due to additional N in surface residues, but drainage N loss was only 1.1 kg N ha yr greater for NRRpre. Post-emergence N application with no residue removal (NRRpost) reduced average drainage N loss by 16.5 kg ha yr compared to pre-plant N fertilization (NRRpre). The farm-gate net  ratio was greatest for RRpost and lowest for NRRpre (14.1 and 10.4 MJ output per MJ input) while greenhouse gas intensity was lowest for RRpost and highest for NRRpre (11.7 and 17.3 g CO-eq. MJ output). Similar to published studies, the simulations showed little difference in NO emissions between scenarios, decreased microbial immobilization for RR compared to NRR, and small soil carbon changes over the 10-yr simulation. In contrast to several previous modeling studies, the crop yield and N lost to drain flow were nearly the same between NRR and RR without supplemental N applied to replace N removed with corn stover. These results are important to optimizing the  and nitrogen budgets associated with corn stover  and for developing a sustainable bioenergy industry.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We designed two contrast methods to induce nHRS in two wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes released in different decades under pot-culture conditions. Partial root-zone stress (PS) was performed using the method of split-root alternative water supply (one half wetting and the other drying) to induce the continuous operation of nHRS, and full root-zone stress (FS) was subjected to whole root system to periodic operation of nHRS. nHRS-mediated signalling increased abscisic acid (ABA) production and triggered ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation, which, thereby, led to up-regulation of antioxidant defense system. Cytokinin synthesis reduced during drought stress while proline and malodialdehyde (MDA) content were increased. Regardless of drought treatment methods and wheat genotype, a significant decrease in grain yield, root biomass and above-ground biomass (p < 0.05) was observed, without significant changes in root-to-shoot ratio.  index was increased, proposing that more  was allocated to reproductive organs during the action of nHRS. Moreover, higher water use efficiency was witnessed in PS. The data suggest that nHRS triggered ABA accumulation, thereby closing stomata, and reducing water use and also decreases the production of ROS and improves the antioxidant defence enzymes, thus enhancing drought tolerance. This survey of different-decade genotypes suggests that advances in grain yield and drought tolerance would be made by targeted selection for a wheat genetic resource.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Here, we report the highest QY (11.8%) thus far for the conversion of NIR to yellow photons by improving the quality of the PbS NC. This high QY was achieved by using highly purified lead and thiourea precursors. This QY is 2.6 times higher than from NCs prepared with commercially available lead and sulfide precursors. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals two reasons for the enhanced QY: longer intrinsic exciton lifetimes of PbS NCs and the ability to support a longer triplet lifetime for the surface-bound transmitter molecule.

Diets of randomly sampled children aged 12⁻36 months in rural southern Ethiopia ( = 218) were assessed after  during relative food security and 3⁻4 months later during relative food insecurity using 24-h weighed food records. Diets were analyzed for protein adequacy, accounting for protein quality using the protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS) method, and potential improvements from QPM substitution were estimated. Stunting was prevalent (38%) at the first assessment. Across seasons, 95⁻96% of children consumed maize, which provided 59⁻61% of  and 51⁻55% of total protein in 24 h. Dietary intakes decreased in the food insecure season, though children were older. Among children no longer breastfeeding, QPM was estimated to reduce inadequacy of utilizable protein intakes from 17% to 13% in the food secure season and from 34% to 19% in the food insecure season. However, breastfed children had only 4⁻6% inadequate intakes of utilizable protein, limiting QPM's potential impact. Due to small farm sizes, maize stores from home production lasted a median of three months. Young Ethiopian children are at risk of inadequate quality protein intakes, particularly after breastfeeding has ceased and during food insecurity. QPM could reduce this risk; however, reliance on access through home production may result in only short-term benefits given the limited quantities of maize produced and stored.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933809>Regional discrepancies in spatiotemporal variations and driving forces of open crop residue burning emissions in China.</a></h1><p>As a major source of secondary organic aerosol, open crop residue burning (OCB) emits a large number of trace gases and particulates to the atmosphere. Extensive OCB is detected during  seasons in most regions of China. Emissions from OCB have been widely investigated in China, but few studies have focused on regional discrepancies in spatiotemporal variations with a long timescale. In this study, emissions from OCB in three typical regions of China, including Northeast China, Chengdu-Chongqing and Guangdong, from 2003 to 2016, were estimated using a combination of statistical data and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations, and regional discrepancies in spatiotemporal variations and driving forces were analyzed in detail. The results showed that OCB emissions of CO and PM in 2016 were 3.63 × 10 and 6.96 × 10 tons in Northeast China, 9.77 × 10 and 1.36 × 10 tons in Chengdu-Chongqing, and 1.24 × 10 and 1.19 × 10 tons in Guangdong, respectively. The OCB emissions in Northeast China maintained an overall increasing trend, which were mainly dominated by rural economic development and agricultural modernization, with great potential for reduction. In Chengdu-Chongqing, emissions increased until 2013 and then decreased, due to the impact of policies prohibiting OCB. In Guangdong, emissions showed annual fluctuations with a slightly decreasing trend influenced by metrological conditions and related policies. The analysis of the driving forces behind the regional discrepancies among these typical regions indicated that OCB emissions in China were characterized by uneven rural economic development, control policies, and natural conditions, suggesting that region-dependent control measures are needed for reducing OCB emissions. This study provided a better understanding of OCB emission characteristics in the three typical regions and revealed the diversity of OCB emission characteristics in China.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A resonant confinement of a polariton under strong photon-exciton coupling is predicted to exist within the microcavity of the crystal's own natural boundaries. Moreover, the radiative  of a localized exciton falls into the spectrum of confinement. Hence, in the experiment, the spontaneous emission of an excited pigment would undergo a two-step process. It should first decay to an excitonic polariton trapped by the cavity resonance. The intermediate polariton could then funnel the  directly to a doped acceptor, leading to the over 90% transfer efficiency observed at less than 1/1000   acceptor/donor ratio. The proposed mechanism is supported by parameter-free analyses entirely based on experiment data.

Here, we report a novel solar steam generation (SSG) system based on reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/nickel foam. Porous rGO foam acting as a photothermal conversion layer is fabricated by coating the rGO microsheets on the metallic nickel foam. The porous structure shows a rough surface, which can improve the  of light by scattering effect. On the other hand, the porous structure ensures the rapid flow of steam in the evaporation process. This SSG system based on rGO/nickel foam converts the absorbed solar  into heat  at the water-air interface and can effectively evaporate (∼83.4%) under low irradiation of 1 sun (1 kw m).

Some of the benefits they provide are not captured in markets, and therefore represent unaccounted environmental externalities that can lead to inefficient decision making. This study uses a replicable method to integrate market and nonmarket economic values into a comprehensive economic evaluation of fuel treatment and bioenergy production using a case study of ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests in Colorado's wildland-urban interface. Treatment costs and people's willingness to pay for better forest health, lower likelihood of wildfire, improved air quality, and expanded renewable  production are incorporated into techno-economic analysis of biopower production. Results show that fuel treatments are likely to be undervalued when evaluated strictly on a financial basis. Under the standard practice of disposing of treatment residues through pile-burning, net present value (NPV) of fuel treatment on 138,034 ha over 20 years is -$275 million, without consideration of nonmarket benefits. If nonmarket benefits associated with forest health, wildfire likelihood and air quality are included, NPV improves to -$116 million. Without the consideration of nonmarket benefits, when treatment resides are used for biopower production, NPV is -$178 million, with net cost savings compared to pile burning attributable to reduced biomass disposal costs and electricity revenue. Accounting for additional air quality benefits and nonmarket value associated with renewable , the bioenergy scenario improves NPV to -$25 million, with 27.7% of outcomes having positive NPV. The impact of additional nonmarket values and potential revenues from timber  are discussed, and are likely to make mean NPV positive for this scenario.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigated the effect of cassava varieties and their  times on starch liquefaction, saccharification, and fermentation. The genotype correlation of the starch properties was revealed for the most suitable cassava varieties. First, the starch content, amylose content, total reducing sugar from liquefaction and saccharification, pasting properties, and ethanol yields of six cassava varieties (Huay Bong 60, Hanatee, Kasetsart 50, Pirun 1, Pirun 2, and Rayong 11) at 6-, 9-, 12-, and 15-month  times were evaluated. The amylose content increased significantly from the 6th to the 12th month but slightly decreased at the 15th month. It was observed that the starch content contributed to a more substantial influence on the change in peak viscosity than on the amylose content. Ethanol fermentation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae TISTR5606 showed that the Rayong 11 variety at the 15-month  time provided the highest ethanol concentration of 104.7 ± 4.1 g L and an ethanol yield of 0.4 ± 0.1 g ethanol g reducing sugar, which corresponded to 74.5% of the theoretical yield.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30710216>A Tunable Resonance Cantilever for Cardiac  Harvesting.</a></h1><p> harvesting from cardiac motion is an attractive means to avoid the use of batteries in implantable sensors and pacemakers.

Since the discovery of Stöber's silica, followed by the discovery of mesoporous silica materials (MSNs) such as MCM-41 and SBA-15, a surge in the design and synthesis of nanosilica with various sizes, shapes, morphologies and textural properties (surface area, pore size and pore volume) has occurred. Dendritic fibrous nanosilica (DFNS; also known as KCC-1) is one of the recent discoveries in morphology-controlled nanomaterials. DFNS shows exceptional performance in large numbers of fields, including catalysis, gas capture, solar  ,  storage, sensors and biomedical applications. This material possesses a unique fibrous morphology, unlike the tubular porous structure of various conventional silica materials. It has a high surface area to volume ratio, with improved accessibility to the internal surface, tunable pore size and pore volume, controllable particle size and, importantly, improved stability. However, synthesis of DFNS with controllable size, textural properties and fiber density is still tricky because of several of the steps involved. This protocol provides a comprehensive step-wise description of DFNS synthesis and advice regarding how to control size, surface area, pore size, pore volume and fiber density. We also provide details of how to apply DFNS in catalysis and CO capture.

ETCAP simulation model was used to forecast forest development for Pozantı area with 17,603 ha forests in Turkey. Wood production, biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration and water provision were the primary ecosystem services. The species composition, natural composition, key habitats and understory vegetation are maintained and small forest openings were left intact for wildlife. Some forest areas were allowed to develop older to provide better opportunities of biodiversity conservation. The increase of carbon stock was related to age class shifts to older stages due mainly to increasing afforestation areas and productivity. The marginal differences in total carbon balance were related to a smaller increase in volume increment in BAU scenario and a higher allocation of  to  production for the LIM and HIM scenarios. The planning scenarios allowed better production of water runoffs with slight differences among the output of management scenarios. The prevailing variable was the areas of afforestation. The impacts of a forest management scenario on ecosystem services highly depend on the development rate and intensity of management interventions.Copyright © 2019.

Isoprostanes-a family of eicosanoids produced by oxidation of phospholipids by oxygen radicals-are biomarkers of pulmonary oxidative stress. Importantly, 8-isoprostane has been implicated as a key biomarker and mediator of oxidative stress because it is a potent pulmonary vasoconstrictor. Antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables hold promise for preventing or reducing effects of oxidative stress-related diseases including chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Here, we investigated 8-isoP and oxidant production by organic dust-exposed airway epithelial cells and the inhibitory effects of an extract from calyces of the sorrel plant, , on oxidant-producing pathways. Confluent cultures of normal human tracheobronchial epithelial cells were pretreated or not with 1% sorrel extract prior to 5% dust extract (DE) exposure. Following DE treatments, live cells, cell-free supernatants, or cell extracts were evaluated for the presence of 8-isoprostane, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, hydroxyl radical, peroxynitrite, and catalase activity to evaluate sorrel's inhibitory effect on oxidative stress. The well-known radical scavenging antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), was used for comparisons with sorrel. DE exposure augmented the production of all radicals measured including 8-isoprostane ( value < 0.001), which could be inhibited by NAC or sorrel. Among reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generated in response to DE exposure, sorrel had no effect on HO production and NAC had no significant effect on NO production. The observations reported here suggest a possible role for sorrel in preventing 8-isoprostane and oxidant-mediated stress responses in bronchial epithelial cells exposed to hog barn dust. These findings suggest a potential role for oxidative stress pathways in mediating occupational lung diseases and antioxidants within sorrel and NAC in reducing dust-mediated oxidative stress within the airways of exposed workers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30998337>EjHAT1 Participates in Heat Alleviation of Loquat Fruit Lignification by Suppressing the Promoter Activity of Key Lignin Monomer Synthesis Gene EjCAD5.</a></h1><p>Texture attributes such as firmness and lignification are important for fruit quality.

The gold nanocrystal-decorated MoS2 nanosheets facilitate sufficiently enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting in the UV-visible region. Different Au nanostructures, such as Au nanoparticles and nanorods, were modified on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets to promote photoelectrochemical water decomposition. By spin-coating a synthetic gold-modified MoS2 hybrid photoanode on a FTO substrate, the efficiency of photoelectrochemical water oxidation was significantly enhanced, by 2 times (nanorods) and 3.5 times (nanoparticles) in the visible-infrared region; furthermore, the average optical resistance was reduced by a factor of two compared to the MoS2 photoanode without Au, and the photocurrent increases exponentially when the system bias was greater than 0.7 volts. The Au-MoS2 metal-semiconductor interface plays an important role in studying the surface plasmon interactions, charge transfer mechanism, and electric field amplification. This rational design for such a unique hybrid nanostructure explains the plasmon-enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting.

Biorefining of grass-clover occurred right after  in a production-scale twin-screw press. The twin-screw pressing separated the grass-clover into a pulp and a green juice. The green juice was fermented using lactic acid bacteria for protein precipitation and then decanted, and the precipitate was heat dried to constitute the green protein concentrate. From the same field, grass-clover was harvested 6 d later due to rainy weather and was prewilted before ensiling. The pulp and the grass-clover were ensiled in bales without additives. The production trial consisted of an incomplete 6 × 4 Latin square trial (3-wk periods; 12 wk total) including 36 lactating Holstein cows. The trial had 6 treatments in a 2 × 3 factorial design with 2 forage types (grass-clover silage and pulp silage) and 3 protein treatments (low protein, high protein with soybean meal, and high protein with a mixture of soybean meal and green protein). The trial was designed to test silage type, protein type, protein level, and the interaction between protein level and silage type. The forage:concentrate ratio was 55:45 in low protein total mixed rations (TMR) and 51:49 in high protein TMR. Low protein and high protein TMR were composed of 372 and 342 g/kg of DM of experimental silages, respectively, and green protein supplemented TMR was composed of 28.5 g/kg of DM of green protein. Silage type did not affect dry matter intake of cows. The average -corrected milk yield was 37.0 and 33.4 kg/d for cows fed pulp silage and grass-clover silage, respectively, resulting in an improved feed efficiency in the cows receiving pulp silage. Milk fat concentration was greater in milk from cows fed pulp silage, and milk protein concentration was lower compared with milk from cows fed grass-clover silage. The in vivo digestibility of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber was greater for pulp silage diets compared with grass-clover silage diets. Eating rate was greater, whereas daily eating duration was lower, for pulp silage diets compared with grass-clover silage diets. The partial substitution of soybean meal with green protein did not affect dry matter intake, milk yield, or eating behavior. The in vivo digestibility of crude protein in green protein supplemented diets was lower compared with soybean meal diets. The results imply that extraction of protein from grassland plants can increase the value of the fiber part of grassland plants.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

For many years, maintenance  requirements have been assumed to be 20% greater in lactating compared with non-lactating beef cows. While not well established, maintenance  requirements are thought to be greatest in primiparous cows and to decline with age. Consequently, early weaning primiparous cow-calf pairs should improve overall efficiency, particularly in situations where mid-to-late lactation forage or feed nutritive value is low. The objective of this study was to determine the biological efficiency of early weaning and maintenance  requirements of lactating versus non-lactating primiparous cows. Experiments were conducted in two consecutive years using 90 primiparous cows and their calves (48 in yr 1, 42 in yr 2). Pairs were randomly assigned to one of the six pens (8 pairs/pen yr 1, 7 pairs/pen yr 2) and pens were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments; (1) early weaning (130 d ± 15.4; EW, n = 6) and (2) traditional weaning (226 d ± 13.1; TW, n = 6). Late lactation cow and calf performance and feed consumption were measured for 92 d (yr 1) and 100 d (yr 2). Cows were limit-fed to meet maintenance requirements, while calves were offered ad libitum access to the same diet in a creep-feeding area. Calves were not allowed access to the cows' feed. Cow feed intake, body condition score, body weight (BW), milk yield and composition, and calf body weight gain and creep feed intake were recorded. After accounting for lactation and retained , there was a trend for greater maintenance  requirements of lactating primiparous cows (P = 0.07). From the early weaning date to traditional weaning date, calf average daily gain (ADG) was greater (P < 0.01) for TW calves. Feed and  efficiency of the pair was improved for the TW system (P < 0.01). Greater ADG were reported for EW calves during the stocker period (P = 0.03), but there were no differences during the finishing period (P > 0.40). At , BW was greater (P = 0.02) and gain to feed ratio tended (P = 0.06) to be improved for TW calves. The increased TW calf performance offset the additional maintenance costs of their lactating dams, resulting in the TW system converting total feed  to kilograms of calf BW gain more efficiently.© The Author(s) 2019.

Although the initial and final electronic states of spin-flip between the lowest singlet and lowest triplet excited state are self-evident, the exact process and the role of intermediate states through which spin-flip occurs are still far from being comprehensively determined. Here, via experimental photo-physical investigations in solution combined with first-principles quantum-mechanical calculations, we show that efficient spin-flip in multiple donor-acceptor charge-transfer-type organic molecular systems involves the critical role of an intermediate triplet excited state that corresponds to a partial molecular structure of the system. Our proposed mechanism unifies the understanding of the intersystem crossing mechanism in a wide variety of charge-transfer-type molecular systems, opening the way to greater control over spin-flip rates.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673289>Protein hydrolysis and fermentation under methanogenic and acidifying conditions.</a></h1><p>Many kinds of wastewaters contain appreciable quantities of protein. Anaerobic processes are suitable for the treatment of wastewater high in organics to achieve pollution control and recovery of  as methane and hydrogen, or intermediates for production of biofuels and valuable biochemicals. A distinction between protein hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation, especially for dissolved proteins, is needed to target which one is truly rate-limiting and to effectively  bioproducts during anaerobic conversion of these wastewaters. This study explored mesophilic anaerobic hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation of gelatine, as a model for dissolved proteins, at pH 7 and at pH 5.The results showed that at pH 7, protein hydrolysis (first-order rate of 0.15 h) was approximately 5 times faster than acidification of the hydrolysis products (first-order rate of 0.03 h), implying that not hydrolysis but acidification was the rate-limiting step in anaerobic dissolved protein degradation. This was confirmed by (temporary) accumulation of amino acids. Nineteen different amino acids were detected during the first 8 incubation hours of gelatine at neutral pH and the total chemical oxygen demand (COD) of these 19 amino acids was up to approximately 40% of the COD of the gelatine that was added. Protein hydrolysis at pH 5 was 2-25 times slower than at pH 7. Shifting the initial pH from neutral to acidic conditions (pH 5) inhibited protein degradation and changed the volatile fatty acids (VFA) product profile. Furthermore, the presence or absence of methanogenic activity did not affect the rates of protein hydrolysis and acidification.The findings in this study can help to set a suitable solid retention time to accomplish anaerobic degradation of protein-rich wastewaters in continuous reactor systems. For example, if the target is harvesting VFAs, methanogens can be washed-out for a shorter retention time while amino acid fermentation, instead of hydrolysis as assumed previously, will govern the design and solutions to improve the system dealing with dissolved proteins.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443457>Differential Impact of Subtherapeutic Antibiotics and Ionophores on Intestinal Microbiota of Broilers.</a></h1><p>Antimicrobial growth promoters (AGPs) are commonly used in the livestock industry at subtherapeutic levels to improve production efficiency, which is achieved mainly through modulation of the intestinal microbiota. However, how different classes of AGPs, particularly ionophores, regulate the gut microbiota remains unclear. In this study, male Cobb broiler chickens were supplemented for 14 days with or without one of five commonly used AGPs including three classical antibiotics (bacitracin methylene disalicylate, tylosin, and virginiamycin) and two ionophores (monensin and salinomycin) that differ in antimicrobial spectrum and mechanisms. Deep sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that two ionophores drastically reduced a number of rare bacteria resulting in a significant decrease in richness and a concomitant increase in evenness of the cecal microbiota, whereas three antibiotics had no obvious impact. Although each AGP modulated the gut microbiota differently, the closer the antibacterial spectrum of AGPs, the more similarly the microbiota was regulated. Importantly, all AGPs had a strong tendency to enrich butyrate- and lactic acid-producing bacteria, while reducing bile salt hydrolase-producing bacteria, suggestive of enhanced metabolism and utilization of dietary carbohydrates and lipids and improved  , which may collectively be responsible for the growth-promoting effect of AGPs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671358>A review on chemical mechanism of microalgae flocculation  polymers.</a></h1><p>Industrially, harvesting of the microalgal biomass is a techno-economic tailback, which essentially meant for the algal biomass industry.

In this review chemical reactions involved in the flocculation of microalage biomass  various certain principal organic polymers are focused. Besides, it focuses on natural biopolymers as flocculants to  the cultivated microalgae. Commercially, bio-flocculation is suitable and cost-effective in the midst of a range of adopted harvesting techniques and the selection of an appropriate bioflocculant depends on its efficacy on the several microalgae strains like potential biomass fixation, ecological stride and non-perilous nature. The harvesting of toxin free microalgae biomass in large quantity by such flocculants can be considered to be one of the most cost-effective performances towards sustainable biomass recovery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497941>Chemically Bonding NiFe-LDH Nanosheets on rGO for Superior Lithium-Ion Capacitors.</a></h1><p>Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have attracted tremendous interest for applications in   and storage. However, the aggregation of nanosheets compromises the accessible active sites and limits their electrochemical performance, especially at high rates. The present study reports the synthesis of highly dispersed NiFe-LDH nanosheets anchored on reduced graphene oxide (NiFe-LDH/rGO) composites chemically bonded via a facile one-step hydrothermal method. Defect-riched rGO provides abundant active sites for heterogeneous nucleation of NiFe-LDH nanosheets, achieving the much efficient charge transfer between rGO and NiFe-LDH as compared to physically mixed NiFe-LDH + rGO. The crystallite size can effectively reduce to 5.5 nm smaller than 15.1 nm of NiFe-LDH without rGO, beneficial to expose more active surface for fast ion diffusion and redox reactions. NiFe-LDH/rGO as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries shows superior lithium storage capacity with 1202 mAh g after 100 cycles at 100 mA g and high-rate performance with 543 mAh g even at 2000 mA g. The corresponding lithium-ion capacitor with NiFe-LDH/rGO anode and mesoporous carbon microsphere cathode exhibits high  density and power density simultaneously, with 133 Wh kg at 25 W kg and 4016 W kg at 58 Wh kg, showing the great potential for high-performance hybrid  storage systems.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451889>Bt Proteins Exacerbate Negative Growth Effects in Juvenile Rusty (F. rusticus) Crayfish Fed Corn Diet.</a></h1><p>The adoption of genetically modified (GM) crops has occurred rapidly in the United States. The transfer of GM corn byproducts from agricultural fields to nearby streams after  is significant and occurs well into the post- year. These corn leaves, stems, and cobs then become a detrital food source for organisms, such as shredders in the stream ecosystem. Considering that the nontarget effects of Bt corn have been observed in some terrestrial organisms, we assessed whether Bt toxins affect an important aquatic organism, juvenile F. rusticus crayfish. Juvenile crayfish were fed six distinct diet treatments: two varieties of Bt corn, two non-Bt controls of herbicide tolerant corn, and two controls: fish gelatin and river detritus. Juveniles were fed these diets while housed in flow-through artificial streams that received natural stream water from a local source. Specific growth rate and survivorship of the crayfish were measured throughout the study. Juveniles fed corn diets grew significantly less and had reduced survival compared with juveniles fed fish gelatin or river detritus diets. Furthermore, juveniles fed one Bt variety of corn (VT Triple Pro) exhibited significantly less growth than those fed one of the herbicide tolerant varieties (Roundup Ready 2). Our study shows that corn inputs to streams may be detrimental to the growth and survivorship of juvenile crayfish and that certain Bt varieties may exacerbate these negative effects. These effects on crayfish will have repercussions for the entire ecosystem, because crayfish are conduits of  between many trophic levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30962507>Yield stability analysis reveals sources of large-scale nitrogen loss from the US Midwest.</a></h1><p>Loss of reactive nitrogen (N) from agricultural fields in the U.S. Midwest is a principal cause of the persistent hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico. We used eight years of high resolution satellite imagery, field boundaries, crop data layers, and yield stability classes to estimate the proportion of N fertilizer removed in  (NUE) versus left as surplus N in 8 million corn (Zea mays) fields at subfield resolutions of 30 × 30 m (0.09 ha) across 30 million ha of 10 Midwest states. On average, 26% of subfields in the region could be classified as stable low yield, 28% as unstable (low yield some years, high others), and 46% as stable high yield. NUE varied from 48% in stable low yield areas to 88% in stable high yield areas. We estimate regional average N losses of 1.12 (0.64-1.67) Tg N y from stable and unstable low yield areas, corresponding to USD 485 (267-702) million dollars of fertilizer value, 79 (45-113) TJ of , and greenhouse gas emissions of 6.8 (3.4-10.1) MMT CO equivalents. Matching N fertilizer rates to crop yield stability classes could reduce regional reactive N losses substantially with no impact on crop yields, thereby enhancing the sustainability of corn-based cropping systems.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820913>Novel harvesting technique of no-touch saphenous vein graft using THUNDERBEAT.</a></h1><p>The no-touch technique of saphenous vein involves harvesting the vein as a pedicled graft and avoidance of direct contact with the vein or excessive high-pressure expansion.

In study 2, 75 similar mice were fed the LF diet (LF) or the HF diet alone (HF) or in combination with up to 0.2% MGO in water (HFM) and 0.067% (HFM-GL) or 0.2% (HFM-GH) dietary genistein for 18 wk. Anthropometric and metabolic data were obtained in both studies to determine the effects of MGO and genistein on variables indicative of MetS.Body weight gain, fat deposits, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and fatty liver were ameliorated by dietary genistein in both studies. The plasma MGO concentration in VHF-G mice was 52% lower than that in VHF mice. Moreover, the AGE concentrations in plasma, liver, and kidney of VHF-G mice were 73%, 52%, and 49%, respectively, lower than in the VHF group (study 1). Similarly, the concentrations of plasma MGO and AGE in plasma, liver, and kidney of HFM-GH mice were 33.5%, 49%, 69%, and 54% lower than in HFM mice (study 2). Genistein inhibited AGE formation by trapping MGO to form adducts and upregulating the expressions of glyoxalase I and II and aldose reductase in liver and kidney to detoxify MGO in both studies.Our data demonstrate for the first time that genistein significantly lowers MGO and AGE concentrations in 2 mouse MetS models via multiple pathways.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31120934>Opening the tap: Increased riverine connectivity strengthens marine food web pathways.</a></h1><p>Reduction of ecosystem connectivity has long-lasting impacts on food webs. Anadromous fish, which migrate from marine to freshwater ecosystems to complete reproduction, have seen their historically larger ecosystem role undercut by widespread riverine habitat fragmentation and other impacts mainly derived from anthropogenic sources. The result has been extensive extirpations and increased susceptibility to a suite of environmental factors that currently impede recovery. Under this present-day context of reduced productivity and connectivity, aggressive management actions and enforcement of catch limits including bycatch caps and complete moratoria on  have followed. What remains less understood are the implications of changes to food webs that co-occurred. What benefits restoration could provide in terms of ecosystem functioning in relation to economic costs associated with dam removal and remediation is unknown and can limit the scope and value of restoration activities. Here we employ, historical landscape-based biomass estimates of anadromous alosine for the first time in an ecosystem modeling of the Northeast US large marine ecosystem (LME), to evaluate the value of improving connectivity by measuring the increase in  flow and population productivity. We compared a restored alosine model to a contemporary model, analyzing the impacts of the potential increase of connectivity between riverine and oceanic systems. There was the potential for a moderate biomass increase of piscivorous species with high economic value, including Atlantic cod, and for a major increase for species of conservation concern such as pelagic sharks, seabirds and marine mammals. Our study highlights the benefits of increased connectivity between freshwater and ocean ecosystems. We demonstrate the significant role anadromous forage fish could play in improving specific fisheries and overall ecosystem functioning, mainly through the diversification of species capable of transferring primary production to upper trophic levels, adding to benefits associated with their restoration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31376314>Analysis of how compliant layers and encapsulation affect power generated from piezoelectric stacked composites for bone healing medical devices.</a></h1><p>Use of piezoelectric materials to   from human motion is commonly investigated. Traditional piezoelectric materials are inefficient at low frequencies but composite structures can increase efficiency at these frequencies. Compliant layer adaptive composite stack (CLACS) is a new piezoelectric PZT (lead zirconate titanate) structure designed for orthopedic implants to use loads generated during walking to provide electrical stimulation for bone healing. The CLACS structure increases power efficiency and structural properties as compared to PZT alone. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of compliant layer and encapsulation thicknesses on strain-related parameters for CLACS predicted by finite element models. Percent changes in strain as compliant layer thickness increased were compared to percent changes in power experimentally produced by CLACS given similar geometries and loading conditions. Percent changes in PZT z-strain matched the trends for increases in experimental power, but was not directly proportional. PZT z-strain and radial strain increased as compliant layer and top and bottom encapsulation thickness increased. PZT z-strain and radial strain decreased as side encapsulation thickness increased for a normalized distributed force on the PZT. The overall goal of this study was to inform future design decisions regarding CLACS structures specifically for use in orthopedic implants.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30884860>Implementation and Validation of a Two-Stage  Extraction Circuit for a Self Sustained Asset-Tracking System.</a></h1><p>We present a two-stage  extraction circuit for a piezoelectric  harvester, powering an asset-tracking system.

By using the proposed  extraction circuit, the transmission rate could be increased from four to six transmissions per second for sinusoidal excitations with an open-circuit-voltage of 60 V .

Although it is intriguing to shift the fossil-fuel-based economy to a renewable carbon-neutral one, which will alleviate environmental problems, there is still a long way to go before it rivals traditional  sources. Existing solar water-splitting devices can be sorted into three categories: photovoltaic-powered electrolysis, PEC water splitting, and photocatalysis (PC). PEC and PC systems hold the potential to further reduce the cost of devices due to their simple structures in which photoabsorbers and catalysts are closely integrated. PC is expected to be the least expensive approach; however, additional costs and concerns are brought about by the subsequent explosive gas separation. At the heart of all devices, semiconductor photoabsorbers should be efficient, robust, and cheap to satisfy the strict requirements on the market. Therefore, this Review intends to give readers an overview on PEC water splitting, with an emphasis on oxide material-based devices, which hold the potential to support global-scale production in the future.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The main taxa of these algae are the Cryptophytes, Haptophytes, Dinophytes, Chromeridae and the Heterokonts, the latter including diatoms, brown algae, Xanthophyceae and Eustigmatophyceae amongst others. Despite the similarity in Lhc proteins between vascular plants and these algae, pigmentation is significantly different since no Chl b is bound, but often replaced by Chl c, and a large diversity in carotenoids functioning in light harvesting and/or photoprotection is present. Due to the presence of Chl c in most of the taxa the name 'Chl c-containing organisms' has become common, however, Chl b-less is more precise since some harbour Lhc proteins that only bind one type of Chl, Chl a. In recent years huge progress has been made about the occurrence and function of Lhc in diatoms, so-called fucoxanthin chlorophyll proteins (FCP), where also the first molecular structure became available recently. In addition, especially  transfer amongst the unusual pigments bound was intensively studied in many of these groups. This review summarises the present knowledge about the molecular structure, the arrangement of the different Lhc in complexes, the excitation  transfer abilities and the involvement in photoprotection of the different Lhc systems in the so-called Chl c-containing organisms.

The exceptional photosensitivity of chlorophylls allows them to  solar  for photosynthesis, but on the other hand, they also generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. A risk of such phototoxicity of the chlorophyll must become particularly prominent upon dynamic cellular interactions that potentially disrupt the mechanisms that are designed to quench photoexcited chlorophylls in the phototrophic cells. Extensive examination of a wide variety of phagotrophic, parasitic, and phototrophic microeukaryotes demonstrates that a catabolic process that converts chlorophylls into nonphotosensitive 13,17-cyclopheophorbide enols (CPEs) is phylogenetically ubiquitous among extant eukaryotes. The accumulation of CPEs is identified in phagotrophic algivores belonging to virtually all major eukaryotic assemblages with the exception of Archaeplastida, in which no algivorous species have been reported. In addition, accumulation of CPEs is revealed to be common among phototrophic microeukaryotes (i.e., microalgae) along with dismantling of their secondary chloroplasts. Thus, we infer that CPE-accumulating chlorophyll catabolism (CACC) primarily evolved among algivorous microeukaryotes to detoxify chlorophylls in an early stage of their evolution. Subsequently, it also underpinned photosynthetic endosymbiosis by securing close interactions with photosynthetic machinery containing abundant chlorophylls, which led to the acquisition of secondary chloroplasts. Our results strongly suggest that CACC, which allowed the consumption of oxygenic primary producers, ultimately permitted the successful radiation of the eukaryotes throughout and after the late Proterozoic global oxygenation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31455813>The complex structure of bile salt hydrolase from Lactobacillus salivarius reveals the structural basis of substrate specificity.</a></h1><p>The gut bacterial bile salt hydrolase (BSH) plays a critical role in host lipid metabolism and  . Therefore, BSH is a promising microbiome target to develop new therapies to regulate obesity in humans and novel non-antibiotic growth promoters for food animals. We previously reported the 1.90 Å apo crystal structure of BSH from Lactobacillus salivarius (lsBSH). In this study, we soaked the lsBSH crystal with glycocholic acid (GCA), a substrate, and obtained a 2.10 Å structure containing complex of lsBSH bound to GCA and cholic acid (CA), a product. The substrate/product sits in the water-exposed cavity molded by Loops 2 and 3. While the glycine moiety of GCA is exposed into a highly polar pocket, the sterane core of GCA is stabilized by aromatic and hydrophobic interactions. Comparison of product binding with BSH from Clostridium perfringenes reveals a distinct orientation of the sterane core in the binding site. The stability of the substrate-lsBSH complex and the putative catalytic mechanism were explored with molecular dynamics simulations. Site-directed mutagenesis of lsBSH demonstrated that Cys2 and Asn171 are critical for enzymatic activity, while Tyr24, Phe65 and Gln257 contribute to the substrate specificity. Together, this study provides structural insights into BSH-substrate interaction, the mechanism of catalysis and substrate specificity, which facilitate rational design of BSH inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30824023>Current and possible approaches for improving photosynthetic efficiency.</a></h1><p>One of the most important tasks laying ahead today's biotechnology is to improve crop productivity with the aim of meeting increased food and  demands of humankind. Plant productivity depends on many genetic factors, including life cycle,  index, stress tolerance and photosynthetic activity. Many approaches were already tested or suggested to improve either. Limitations of photosynthesis have also been uncovered and efforts been taken to increase its efficiency. Examples include decreasing photosynthetic antennae size, increasing the photosynthetically available light spectrum, countering oxygenase activity of Rubisco by implementing C4 photosynthesis to C3 plants and altering source to sink transport of metabolites. A natural and effective photosynthetic adaptation, the sugar alcohol metabolism got however remarkably little attention in the last years, despite being comparably efficient as C4, and can be considered easier to introduce to new species. We also propose root to shoot carbon-dioxide transport as a means to improve photosynthetic performance and drought tolerance at the same time.

Especially, microreactors have received a plethora of attention due to the increased mass and heat transfer characteristics, the possibility to increase process safety, and the potential to implement automation protocols and process analytical technology. Taking advantage of these aspects, chemists and chemical engineers have capitalized on expanding the chemical space available to synthetic organic chemists using this technology. Electrochemistry has recently witnessed a renaissance in research interests as it provides chemists unique and tunable synthetic opportunities to carry out redox chemistry using electrons as traceless reagents, thus effectively avoiding the use of hazardous and toxic reductants and oxidants. The popularity of electrochemistry stems also from the potential to  sustainable electricity, derived from solar and wind . Hence, the electrification of the chemical industry offers an opportunity to locally produce commodity chemicals, effectively reducing inefficiencies with regard to transportation and storage of hazardous chemicals. The combination of flow technology and electrochemistry provides practitioners with great control over the reaction conditions, effectively improving the reproducibility of electrochemistry. However, carrying out electrochemical reactions in flow is more complicated than just pumping the chemicals through a narrow-gap electrolytic cell. Understanding the engineering principles behind the observations can help researchers to exploit the full potential of the technology. Thus, the prime objective of this Account is to provide readers with an overview of the underlying engineering aspects which are associated with continuous-flow electrochemistry. This includes a discussion of relevant mass and heat transport phenomena encountered in electrochemical flow reactors. Next, we discuss the possibility to integrate several reaction steps in a single streamlined process and the potential to carry out challenging multiphase electrochemical transformations in flow. Due to the high control over mass and heat transfer, electrochemical reactions can be carried out with great precision and reproducibility which provide opportunities to enhance and tune the reaction selectivity. Finally, we detail on the scale-up potential of flow electrochemistry and the importance of small interelectrode gaps on pilot and industrial-scale electrochemical processes. Each principle has been illustrated with a relevant organic synthetic example. In general, we have aimed to describe the underlying engineering principles in simple words and with a minimum of equations to attract and engage readers from both a synthetic organic chemistry and a chemical engineering background.

However, it is still hindered by poor electrochemical stability derived from the bulk/interface structure degradation and side reactions under high working voltage. In this work, fast ion conductor LiV(PO) (LVPO) is adopted to modify the surface of spinel LNMO by a one-step facile method to  the maximum benefit of interface properties. It is found that 1 wt % LVPO-LNMO exhibits the most excellent cycling performances, retaining great capacity retention of 87.8% after 500 cycles at room temperature and 82.4% for 150 cycles at 55 °C. Moreover, the rate performance is also significantly improved (90.4 mAh g under 20C). It is revealed that the LVPO-involved layer could effectively suppress the surface side reactions under high working voltage, which mainly contributes to an improved interface with desirable structural stability and excellent kinetics behavior without sacrificing the surface electrochemical activity in an electrochemical environment. Thus, the dissolution of transition-metal ions is effectively mitigated, avoiding further structure degradation of the bulk material. Especially, it is also established that the vanadium (V) ions in LVPO could be to a certain extent migrated into the surface lattice of LNMO to generate a V-involved transition layer (Li-Ni-Mn-V-O surface solid solution), which greatly co-contributes to the enhanced electrochemical performances owing to the prominently depressed charge-transfer resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337149>Label-Free Proteomic Analysis of Molecular Effects of 2-Methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone on .</a></h1><p> is the principal pathogen causing blue mold of citrus.

Most of the identified DEPs were involved in molecular function (47%), meanwhile 27% DEPs were involved in the cellular component and 26% DEPs were involved in the biological process. Twenty-eight proteins identified for differential metabolic pathways by KEGG were sub-categorized into 60 classifications. Functional characterization by GO and KEGG enrichment results suggests that the DEPs are mainly related to  generation (mitochondrial carrier protein, glycoside hydrolase, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase), NADPH supply (enolase, pyruvate carboxylase), oxidative stress (catalase, glutathione synthetase), and pentose phosphate pathway (ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase and xylulose 5-phosphate). Three of the down-regulated proteins selected randomly the nitro-reductase family protein, mono-oxygenase, and cytochrome P450 were verified using parallel reaction monitoring. These findings illustrated that MNQ may inhibit  by disrupting the metabolic processes, especially in  metabolism and stimulus response that are both critical for the growth of the fungus. In conclusion, based on the molecular mechanisms, MNQ can be developed as a potential anti-fungi agent against .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560511>Room-Temperature Welding of Silver Telluride Nanowires for High-Performance Thermoelectric Film.</a></h1><p>Flexible thermoelectric materials that can  waste heat  have attracted great attention because of the rapid progress of flexible electronics. AgTe nanowires (AgTe NWs) are considered as promising thermoelectric materials to fabricate flexible thermoelectric film and device because of their high Seebeck coefficient, but poor contact between the AgTe NWs results in low electrical conductivity. Generally, hot or cold pressing can increase the electrical conductivity between the AgTe NWs. However, these process tend to destroy the initial morphology of the AgTe NWs and/or cause only physical contact between the AgTe NWs. Herein, we report an approach to the room-temperature welding of AgTe NWs to enhance their contacts by facile combination of vacuum filtration and drop-coating methods. The obtained AgTe NWs film exhibits excellent Seebeck coefficient of -99.48 μV/K and high electrical conductivity of 15 335.05 S/m at room temperature, which gives the power factor of 151.76 μW m K. Surprisingly, an optimal Seebeck coefficient of -154.96 μV/K and electrical conductivity of 14 982.42 S/m can be obtained at 420 K, giving a power factor of 359.76 μW m K. Moreover, the electrical resistance of the AgTe NWs film was only 1.3 times of the initial electrical resistance after 1000 bending cycles, indicating good flexibility of the film. A finger-touch test is conducted by using the AgTe NWs film as thermoelectric power generator, which achieves a stable output voltage of about 0.52 mV, suggesting its great potential applications in self-powered flexible electronic devices.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914068>Metagenomic reconstructions of gut microbial metabolism in weanling pigs.</a></h1><p>The piglets' transition from milk to solid feed induces a succession of bacterial communities, enhancing the hosts' ability to   from dietary carbohydrates. To reconstruct microbial carbohydrate metabolism in weanling pigs, this study combined 16S rRNA gene sequencing (n = 191) and shotgun metagenomics (n = 72).Time and wheat content in feed explained most of the variation of the microbiota as assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing in weanling pigs. De novo metagenomic binning reconstructed 360 high-quality genomes that represented 11 prokaryotic and 1 archaeal phylum. Analysis of carbohydrate metabolism in these genomes revealed that starch fermentation is carried out by a consortium of Firmicutes expressing extracellular α-(1 → 4)-glucan branching enzyme (GH13) and Bacteroidetes expressing periplasmic neopullulanase (GH13) and α-glucosidase (GH97). Fructans were degraded by extracellular GH32 enzymes from Bacteriodetes and Lactobacillus. Lactose fermentation by β-galactosidases (GH2 and GH42) was identified in Firmicutes. In conclusion, the assembly of 360 high-quality genomes as the first metagenomic reference for swine intestinal microbiota allowed identification of key microbial contributors to degradation of starch, fructans, and lactose.Microbial consortia that are responsible for degradation of these glycans differ substantially from the microbial consortia that degrade the same glycans in humans. Our study thus enables improvement of feeding models with higher feed efficiency and better pathogen control for weanling pigs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31516083>A Paper-Based Biological Solar Cell.</a></h1><p>A merged system incorporating paperfluidics and papertronics has recently emerged as a simple, single-use, low-cost paradigm for disposable point-of-care (POC) diagnostic applications. Stand-alone and self-sustained paper-based systems are essential to providing effective and lifesaving treatments in resource-constrained environments. Therefore, a realistic and accessible power source is required for actual paper-based POC systems as their diagnostic performance and portability rely significantly on power availability. Among many paper-based batteries and  storage devices, paper-based microbial fuel cells have attracted much attention because bacteria can  electricity from any type of organic matter that is readily available in those challenging regions. However, the promise of this technology has not been translated into practical power applications because of its short power duration, which is not enough to fully operate those systems for a relatively long period. In this work, we for the first time demonstrate a simple and long-lasting paper-based biological solar cell that uses photosynthetic bacteria as biocatalysts. The bacterial photosynthesis and respiration continuously and self-sustainably generate power by converting light  into electricity. With a highly porous and conductive anode and an innovative solid-state cathode, the biological solar cell built upon the paper substrates generated the maximum current and power density of 65 µA/cm and 10.7 µW/cm, respectively, which are considerably greater than those of conventional micro-sized biological solar cells. Furthermore, photosynthetic bacteria in a 3-D volumetric chamber made of a stack of papers provided stable and long-lasting electricity for more than 5 h, while electrical current from the heterotrophic culture on 2-D paper dramatically decreased within several minutes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161201>The intestinal microbiota and cardiovascular disease.</a></h1><p>The intestinal microbiota of human hosts is the community of microorganisms living in the small and, mainly, the large intestine of humans. This microbial ecosystem has co-evolved with humans across the millennia, has come to play an important interactive role in human physiology and has been aptly called our forgotten organ. Significant properties of the microbiota benefiting its host include   from food sources indigestible by humans, protection from pathogen colonization, and vitamin synthesis. Mounting evidence has linked changes in the composition or metabolic profiles of the microbiota with human disease, including disorders of the cardiovascular spectrum. Although cause and effect mechanisms are as yet essentially unproven in the relevant literature, the established associations point to the importance of the microbiota in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this review, we first summarize key information on the gut microbial communities and the elaborate tools developed to analyse their structure and metabolic functions. Ecological terms are explained and analytical techniques are simplified, to enhance the understanding of published studies. Statistical methods used in microbial analysis are also described in simple terms. We then present published literature on the association of the compositional and functional changes of the microbiota with CVD, including heart failure, hypertension, and atherosclerosis. Each section of the review deals with the underlying pathophysiology of the relevant associations, connecting the observational and mechanistic aspects. Finally, we discuss the challenges that remain to be met before this field of research can generate knowledge which can impact everyday clinical practice.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

The proposed design exhibits an improved RF-DC conversion efficiency over a wide frequency range from 1.2 to 5 GHz. This frequency band is associated with several wireless communication services, for instance, ISM, WLAN, 5G, LTE, and GPS applications. The receiving planar ASDA exhibits circular polarization and has an average measured gain of 4.5 dBi from 1.2 to 5 GHz. To enable a wide operating bandwidth, the rectifier circuit is constituted by two architectures, designated A and B. Each scheme is designed to  power efficiently across a specific bandwidth. The optimal performance of both rectifiers are obtained using the nonlinear harmonic-balance simulations. The antenna⁻rectifier integration yields a compact rectenna with a high-efficiency performance over the intended bandwidth from 1.2 to 5 GHz for an input power of 9 dBm and terminal load resistance of 1 k Ω . The total measured RF-DC conversion efficiency is maintained above 30% across the entire frequency range with a peak value of 61% achieved at 1.2 GHz. In comparison with similar architectures, the proposed rectenna maintains a stable output efficiency despite the wide fluctuations in the input frequency and also has a minimum footprint size (58 × 55 mm 2 ).</p></html>
