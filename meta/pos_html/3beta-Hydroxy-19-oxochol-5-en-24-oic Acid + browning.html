Its inhibitors may be applied to efficiently treat hyperpigmentation and are widely used in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products, food supplements and insecticides. Previous studies have shown that heterocyclic compounds with an amino group can inhibit tyrosinase activity. The present study aims to evaluate the inhibitory effect of some novel 2,6-diamino-4-chloropyrimidine derivatives (1a-e) and 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine (2a-e) including bioactive aniline moiety on the activity of the mushroom tyrosinase.In practice, the azo salt was initially synthesized from aniline derivatives and combined subsequently with the 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine and 2,6-diamino-4 chloropyrimidine followed by crystallization. The structures of resulting compounds were confirmed by FT-IR, C NMR, and H NMR. The derivatives (0-100 µM) were evaluated for their inhibitory effect on tyrosinase activity using l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) as substrate.All compounds showed inhibitory effects against the activity of the enzyme. About 23.72-55.08% inhibition was observed in the presence of 30 µM of each compound. The IC values of the synthesized compounds were measured, and their inhibition properties were also visualized by zymography. Based on the results, the compounds 1a-e and 2a-e showed moderate inhibitory activities. Notably, pyrimidine derivatives 1a (IC=24.68) and 1d (IC=24.45) also exhibited similar inhibitory activities when compared with the positive control, kojic  (IC=25.24 µM). Kinetic studies indicated that the type of inhibition was noncompetitive.All results suggest that pyrimidine derivatives, especially 1d and 1a, can be considered as safe and efficient tyrosinase inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30787348>Nullifying phosphatidic  effect and controlling phospholipase D associated  in litchi pericarp through combinatorial application of hexanal and inositol.</a></h2><p>The role of phospholipid modification initiated by phospholipase D (PLD) in enzymatic  has been revoked through this study. Various alcohols and aldehydes were tried to read out their PLD controlling behaviour. Based on in-vitro results, reagents like hexanal and inositol were used to regulate PLD activity of litchi fruit stored at ambient temperature and their effects on fruit quality and physiological characteristics were also investigated. The results showed that combinatorial chemical treatment was successful in maintaining freshness of fruit through delayed physiological loss in weight and hence maintaining firmness. Combinatorial treated fruit had lower  index than control by day 7. This novel treatment also maintained comparable levels of total phenolics and lowered the level of malondialdehyde. Evaluation of antioxidative enzymatic profile also confirmed the alleviation of oxidative stress of litchi fruit at ambient temperature. Thus, this strategy of enzyme regulation could play a vital role in overall quality maintenance of litchi fruit.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30422002>Antioxidant activity and Neurite outgrowth-enhancing activity of scorbamic  and a red pigment derived from ascorbic .</a></h2><p>L-Ascorbic  (AA), known as vitamin C, can form  products by a non-enzymatic process during storage and the  products cause deterioration of agricultural products. In the  reaction, a red pigment, 2,2´-nitrilodi-2(2´)-deoxy-L-ascorbic  ammonium salt (NDA), is generated from AA via L-scorbamic  (SCA) as an intermediate. However, the biological activities of SCA and NDA have not yet been clarified. In this study, we assayed the antioxidant activities of SCA and NDA using ABTS radical cation and their neurite outgrowth-enhancing activities in PC12 cells. SCA showed stronger radical-scavenging activity than that of AA, while NDA hardly showed any activity. SCA and NDA enhanced the neurite outgrowth induced by dibutyryl cyclic AMP after their incorporation into cells in the same manner as that of AA. The results indicated that SCA has antioxidant activity and that SCA and NDA have neurite outgrowth-enhancing activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31177056>Mediators of cachexia in cancer patients.</a></h2><p>Alterations in amino  and protein metabolism-particularly in skeletal muscle-are a key feature of cancer that contributes to the cachexia syndrome. Thus, skeletal muscle protein turnover is characterized by an exacerbated rate of protein degradation, promoted by an activation of different proteolytic systems that include the ubiquitin-proteasome and the autophagic-lysosomal pathways. These changes are promoted by both hormonal alterations and inflammatory mediators released as a result of the systemic inflammatory response induced by the tumor. Other events, such as alterations in the rate of myogenesis/apoptosis and decreased regeneration potential also affect skeletal muscle in patients with cancer. Mitochondrial dysfunction also contributes to changes in skeletal muscle metabolism and further contributes to the exacerbation of the cancer-wasting syndrome. Different inflammatory mediators-either released by the tumor or by the patient's healthy cells-are responsible for the activation of these catabolic processes that take place in skeletal muscle and in other tissues/organs, such as liver or adipose tissues. Indeed, white adipose tissue is also subject to extensive wasting and "" of some of the white adipocytes into beige cells; therefore increasing the energetic inefficiency of the patient with cancer. Recently, an interest in the role of micromRNAs-either free or transported into exosomes-has been related to the events that take place in white adipose tissue during cancer cachexia.Copyright © 2019.

Recently, an in vitro study showed that supraphysiological concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) had a strong influence on the induction of adipocyte . On the other hand, concentrations in the physiological range, achieved through ketogenic diets and prolonged fasting produce values of 1-3 mM and 4-7 mM, respectively. Herein, we investigated the impact of physiological concentrations of βHB on metabolism, and the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and other  markers in adipose tissues.The effects of βHB on adipocyte  were investigated in vitro, using primary cultures of isolated visceral and subcutaneous fat cells and cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and in vivo.It was determined that βHB failed to induce changes in the oxidative capacity, citrate synthase activity or  gene expression patterns in isolated adipocytes, and did not exert a permissive effect on β-adrenergic agonist-induced . In addition, 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated following βHB treatment exhibited downregulated Ucp1 expression levels, a result that was recapitulated in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of Wistar rats after βHB salt treatment. Rats administered βHB salts also presented reduced brown adipose tissue UCP1 protein expression.The mechanisms underlying ketogenic diet-induced  of adipocytes are not known. The results from the present study indicate that physiological concentrations of βHB are not responsible for this phenomenon, despite the observed βHB-mediated downregulation of UCP1 expression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The goal of this study was to evaluate differences in the brown-like characteristic and proteome among human EAT, PAT, and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) to identify candidate molecules causing CAD. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) and other brown-related proteins were highly expressed in pericardial adipose tissue but was weakly expressed in SAT from the same non-CAD patient. Moreover, pericardial adipose tissues displayed a higher thermogenesis than SAT. However, brown-related genes were lower in CAD pericardial fat. Remarkably, there were lower levels of metabolic enzymes involved in glycolysis, tricarboxylic  cycle, and fatty  metabolism in pericardial adipose tissues of CAD. EAT is an organ adjacent to aortic root without anatomy barriers, which differs from PAT. We found that the expression of ribosomal protein S3A (RPS3A) was decreased in human EAT as well as in mouse perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). Knockdown of RPS3A significantly inhibited adipocyte differentiation in preadipocytes and impaired the function of mitochondria in mature adipocytes. Moreover, RPS3A knockdown in mouse periaortic adipose tissue impaired  of PVAT, accelerated vascular inflammation, and atherosclerosis progression. Mechanistically, RPS3A can migrate to the mitochondria to maintain the function of brown adipocytes. These findings provide compelling evidence that RPS3A was a key factor for modulating the brown fat-specific gene UCP-1 and carbon metabolic enzymes in EAT for preventing CAD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31054659>Effect of eugenol fumigation treatment on chilling injury and CBF gene expression in eggplant fruit during cold storage.</a></h2><p>The effect of eugenol (EUG) on chilling injury (CI) to eggplant fruit (Solanum melongena L.) was investigated. Eggplant fruit were pre-treated with 25 μL/L EUG, and then stored at 4 °C for 12 days. Results showed that EUG fumigation treatment effectively retarded the CI development, reduced pulp , weight loss, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and sustained soluble solids content (SSC) and proline content. Moreover, the activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) were inhibited by EUG. C-repeat/dehydration-responsive element binding factors (CBF) genes are transcription factors playing a critical role in cold acclimation. To illuminate the molecular regulation of EUG on chilling tolerance in eggplant fruit, a 1151 bp SmCBF gene was identified and the effect of EUG on SmCBF expression was determined by RT-qPCR. EUG resulted in a higher SmCBF expression. These findings suggested that EUG treatment had potential effect on alleviating CI in eggplant fruit.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Forty-eight lambs were assigned (n = 16) to either a grain-based diet at moderate (MOD, 42 mg∙kg VitE as all-rac α-tocopheryl acetate) or supranutritional (SUP, 285 mg∙kg of vitE) levels of synthetic VitE or a lucerne hay-based diet (LUC; 37 mg∙kg VitE) for 8 weeks. Meat from the LUC group had lower muscle n-6 and PUFA levels compared to meat from the MOD and SUP groups. Despite a similar VitE intake, muscle VitE was higher for LUC compared to MOD, while SUP lambs showed the highest VitE. Lipid oxidation did not differ between groups. For fresh meat, redness tended to be higher in LUC fed lambs than the other two groups, but brownness formation was only lower than the SUP group. For aged meat colour stability, redness tended to be higher in lambs fed SUP and LUC, whereas highest  occurred in the MOD group.Crown Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Fiori] is a natural source of minerals, fiber, inulin, and polyphenols. A ready-to-cook (RTC) version of this product could improve its commercialization and consumption. In this study, the effects of (i) anti- treatments (citric  0.5% + ascorbic  2%, or cysteine 0.5%, w/v) and (ii) dipping in locust bean gum (LBG) edible coating with or without Foeniculum vulgare essential oil (EO) were evaluated on RTC globe artichoke slices cv. 'Spinoso sardo' during storage (11 days at 4 °C). Fresh weight loss, color, texture, polyphenol oxidase (PPO), microbiological and chemical parameters, antioxidant capacity, and sensory descriptors were determined.The results showed that, despite the antioxidant treatment used, when EO was added to LBG, all microbiological groups underwent an average reduction of 0.50 log CFU g . Cysteine preserved the antioxidant capacity, color, and texture of samples better than citric  and ascorbic , and inhibited PPO; the addition of EO to LBG enhanced these effects. At the end of the storage period, the overall highest sensory attribute score was attained by the coated globe artichoke samples with EO.The marked efficacy of the LBG edible coating with added F. vulgare EO in maintaining microbiological, physical, chemical, and sensory qualities makes it a promising processing tool for the preservation of ready-to-cook Spinoso sardo globe artichoke slices during storage for 11 days at 4 °C. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316571>An Ancient Chinese Herbal Decoction Containing Angelicae Sinensis Radix, Astragali Radix, Jujuba Fructus, and Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens Stimulates the  Conversion of White Adipocyte in Cultured 3T3-L1 Cells.</a></h2><p>Abnormal storage of white adipocyte tissue (WAT) is the major factor causing obesity. The promising strategies for obesity treatment are building up the brown adipocyte tissue (BAT) and/or expedite fatty  catabolism. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) sheds light on preventing obesity. Ginger is one of the most effective herbs for antiobesity by accelerating  WAT. To fortify the antiobesity effect of ginger, an ancient Chinese herbal decoction composed of four herbs, Angelicae Sinensis Radix (ASR), Astragali Radix (AR), Jujuba Fructus (JF), and Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens (ZRR; ginger), was tested here: this herbal formula was written in AD 1155, named as Danggui Buxue Tang (DBT). Therefore, the antiobesity function of this ancient herbal decoction was revealed  by cultured 3T3-L1 cells.The lipid accumulation was detected by Oil Red O staining. Furthermore, the underlying working mechanisms of antiobesity functions of DBT were confirmed in 3T3-L1 cells by confocal microscopy, western blot, and RT-PCR.DBT was able to actuate brown fat-specific gene activations, which included (i) expression of PPAR, UCP1, and PCG1 and (ii) fatty  oxidation genes, i.e., CPT1A and HSL. The increase of  WAT, triggered by DBT, was possibly mediated by a Ca-AMPK signaling pathway, because the application of Ca chelator, BAMPTA-AM, reversed the effect.These findings suggested that the herbal mixture DBT could potentiate the antiobesity functions of ginger, which might have potential therapeutic implications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30675120>Production of Bone Broth Powder with Spray Drying Using Three Different Carrier Agents.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study is to determine the some physicochemical (proximate composition, pH and a values) and reconstitution (wettability, dispersibility and solubility index (SI)) properties of spray-dried bone broth powder (BBP) along with the effects of the addition of different carrier agents. Subsequently, the powdered products were stored to determine the storage stability (pH, lipid oxidation, color,  index) for 3 mon at -18℃. For this purpose, firstly marrow-containing bones ( and ) have been boiled to get the bone broth. Three different emulsions were respectively prepared (1) 20% maltodextrin (MD) added BBP, (2) 20% whey powder isolate (WPI) added BBP and (3) 10% MD and 10% WPI added BBP and the emulsions were dried using a spray-dryer with 185℃ inlet and 95℃ outlet temperature. The proximate composition and reconstitution properties of BBP were found statistically different (p<0.05) depending on the use of different carrier agents. MD added BBP showed uniform and smooth morphology. The color,  index, thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) and pH values of BBP significantly changed (p<0.05) during storage.

Several studies showed that irisin involves in thermogenesis and increases the expression of  markers such as uncoupling protein-1 that in turns induces the conversion of white adipose tissue to brown fat. Resveratrol (Res) and all-trans retinoic  (ATRA) can also upregulate the expression of thermogenesis genes. In the present study, the effects of single and combined treatments of Res and ATRA on fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (FNDC5) gene expression was explored.The mouse myoblasts, C2C12 cells, were seeded in 6-well plastic plates and cultured in DMEM media. After differentiation, in a pilot study, C2C12 myotubes were treated with different concentrations of Res and ATRA for 12 h. The best result was obtained by treatment of 1and 25 μM of Res and 1 μM of ATRA. Then the main study was continued by single and combined treatment of these compounds at chosen concentration. After treatments, total RNA was extracted from C2C12 cells. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated by the cDNA synthesis kit and FNDC5 mRNA expression was evaluated by the real-time PCR method.The FNDC5 gene expression in C2C12 myotubes of alone-treated with 1 μM, 25 μM Res and 10 μM ATRA did not change compared to vehicle group. However, in combination-treated the expression of FNDC5 gene was significantly increased compared to vehicle group.This is the first evidence that Res and ATRA can regulate FNDC5 gene expression in C2C12 myotubes.

Understanding the lipidomic and transcriptomic profiles of WAT upon cold exposure provides insights into the adaptive changes associated with this process.Here, we applied mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to provide a comprehensive resource for describing the lipidomic or transcriptome profiles in cold-induced inguinal WAT (iWAT). We showed that short-term (3-day) cold exposure induces  of iWAT, increases energy expenditure, and results in loss of body weight and fat mass. Lipidomic analysis shows that short-term cold exposure leads to dramatic changes of the overall composition of lipid classes WAT. Notably, cold exposure induces significant changes in the acyl-chain composition of triacylglycerols (TAGs), as well as the levels of glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids in iWAT. RNA-seq and qPCR analysis suggests that short-term cold exposure alters the expression of genes and pathways involved in fatty  elongation, and the synthesis of TAGs, sphingolipids, and glycerophospholipids. Furthermore, the cold-induced lipid dynamics and gene expression pathways in iWAT are contrary to those previously observed in metabolic syndrome, neurodegenerative disorders, and aging, suggesting beneficial effects of cold-induced WAT  on health and lifespan.We described the significant alterations in the composition of glyphospholipids, glycerolipids, and sphingolipids and expression of genes involved in thermogenesis, fatty  elongation, and fatty  metabolism during the response of iWAT to short-term cold exposure. We also found that some changes in the levels of specific lipid species happening after cold treatment of iWAT are negatively correlated to metabolic diseases, including obesity and T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31429928>Escherichia coli "TatExpress" strains export several g/L human growth hormone to the periplasm by the Tat pathway.</a></h2><p>Escherichia coli is a heavily used platform for the production of biotherapeutic and other high-value proteins, and a favored strategy is to export the protein of interest to the periplasm to simplify downstream processing and facilitate disulfide bond formation. The Sec pathway is the standard means of transporting the target protein but it is unable to transport complex or rapidly folding proteins because the Sec system can only transport proteins in an unfolded state. The Tat system also operates to transport proteins to the periplasm, and it has significant potential as an alternative means of recombinant protein production because it transports fully folded proteins. Here, we have tested the Tat system's full potential for the production of biotherapeutics for the first time using fed-batch fermentation. We expressed human growth hormone (hGH) with a Tat signal peptide in E. coli W3110 "TatExpress" strains that contain elevated levels of the Tat apparatus. This construct contained four amino  from TorA at the hGH N-terminus as well as the initiation methionine from hGH, which is removed in vivo. We show that the protein is efficiently exported to the periplasm during extended fed-batch fermentation, to the extent that it is by far the most abundant protein in the periplasm. The protein was shown to be homogeneous, disulfide bonded, and active. The bioassay showed that the yields of purified periplasmic hGH are 5.4 g/L culture whereas an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay gave a figure of 2.39 g/L. Separate analysis of a TorA signal peptide linked to hGH construct lacking any additional amino  likewise showed efficient export to the periplasm, although yields were approximately two-fold lower.© 2019 The Authors.

The addition of TA at 15% (w/w) increased the transparency value of biopolymer films. The highest increment of transparency value was obtained for MC-TA film, increased from 0.572 to 4.73 A/mm. Based on antimicrobial study, the addition of TA improved the antibacterial properties of biopolymers against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The ability of films to preserve both fruits was evaluated in a 14-day preservation study. The application of biopolymer films treated with TA has decreased the weight loss and  index of fruits, as compared to control films. A significant reduction in the weight loss of cherry tomatoes wrapped with chitosan (from 21.3 to 19.6%), gelatin (from 22.1 to 15.5%) and methylcellulose (26.2 to 20.5%) films were obtained following TA treatment. Overall, results obtained from this study highlight the effects of TA on physiochemical properties of biopolymer films and their ability to preserve fruits.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The parameters were determined after left the fruits at 25°C for 2 days. It was found that, in the tissue adjacent to the core, 5.0 mM SA for 2 hr and 0.01 mM MeJA for 3 hr alleviated chilling injury (CI) and maintained color than other treatments. The MeJA immersions lowered CI score, electrolyte leakage, and malondialdehyde content greater than other treatments. SA and MeJA immersions retarded polyphenol oxidase activity, total phenols, and induced antioxidant activity during storage. In the pulp tissue, SA treatment increased ascorbic  and total sugar contents, and MeJA immersions enhanced bioactive compound and antioxidant enzyme activities than SA immersion. Therefore, MeJA immersions could alleviate CI and enhance antioxidant better than other treatments of pineapples during cold storage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Postharvest immersion at the optimum concentration of SA or MeJA can be applied for commercial scale in order to alleviate chilling of "Sawi" pineapple fruit during storage. MeJA treatment enhances antioxidant activity and reduces internal  better than SA treatment in pineapple.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30835453>Unexpected Potential of Iso-oligosaccharides in the Generation of Important Food Odorants.</a></h2><p>The generation of selected Maillard-derived odorants from iso-oligosaccharides (IOSs), namely, from isomaltose, isomaltotriose, isomaltulose, and melibiose, was studied and compared with that from other oligosaccharides (maltose, lactose, and panose) and monosaccharides (glucose, galactose, and fructose).

Phenolic , flavonoids, lignans and other polyphenols were the predominant polyphenols detected with Triple-TOF-LC-MS/MS. The highest concentration of ferulic , didymin, dihydro-p-coumaric , sesaminol and matairesinol isomers were found among all the compounds detected. After HPP treatment, irrespective of the pressures applied, new simple polyphenols like oleuropein, 4-vinylsyringol, isocoumarin, and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde were detected. Both phenomena could be attributed to the release of bounded phenolic compounds after applying HPP, as well as enzymatic degradation and/or condensation.

When used as a therapeutic approach, direct delivery of Cas9 protein and single-guide RNA (sgRNA) could circumvent the safety issues associated with plasmid delivery and therefore represents an attractive tool for precision genome engineering. Gene deletion or editing in adipose tissue to enhance its energy expenditure, fatty  oxidation, and secretion of bioactive factors through a "" process presents a potential therapeutic strategy to alleviate metabolic disease. Here, we developed "CRISPR-delivery particles," denoted CriPs, composed of nano-size complexes of Cas9 protein and sgRNA that are coated with an amphipathic peptide called Endo-Porter that mediates entry into cells. Efficient CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene deletion of ectopically expressed GFP by CriPs was achieved in multiple cell types, including a macrophage cell line, primary macrophages, and primary pre-adipocytes. Significant GFP loss was also observed in peritoneal exudate cells with minimum systemic toxicity in GFP-expressing mice following intraperitoneal injection of CriPs containing -targeting sgRNA. Furthermore, disruption of a nuclear co-repressor of catabolism, the  gene, in white adipocytes by CriPs enhanced adipocyte  with a marked increase of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression. Of note, the CriP-mediated  deletion did not produce detectable off-target effects. We conclude that CriPs offer an effective Cas9 and sgRNA delivery system for ablating targeted gene products in cultured cells and , providing a potential therapeutic strategy for metabolic disease.© 2018 Shen et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208605>Sono-photodynamic inactivation of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in orange juice.</a></h2><p>Efficiency of blue (462 ± 3 nm) light emitting diode (LED) illumination to inactivate Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in the presence of exogenous photosensitizer (curcumin) was studied in freshly squeezed orange juice. Further, the combinational effect of ultrasound (US), photosensitizer (PS) and blue light (BL) on inactivation of microbes was evaluated. The effect of process parameters such as concentration of PS, US and volume of the juice on E. coli and S. aureus inactivation was also investigated. The US alone and PS + BL treatments resulted in 3.02 ± 0.52 and 1.06 ± 0.13 log reduction of E. coli; 0.18 ± 0.14 and 2.34 ± 0.13 log reduction of S. aureus, respectively. The combination of PS + US + BL treatment at optimized conditions resulted in 2.35 ± 0.16 log reduction of S. aureus. An additive effect on the inactivation of E. coli (4.26 ± 0.32 log reduction) was observed with PS + US + BL combination treatment. The US treatment showed significant change in cloud value, colour and  index of orange juice. The combinational non-thermal processes (PS + BL and PS + US + BL) did not have any significant effect on total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, and hesperidin content of the orange juice. However, these processes affected ascorbic  content and antioxidant activity negatively. Thus, this study indicated that photodynamic inactivation of E. coli and S. aureus using LED-based photosensitization in fruit juices could be a potential method for microbial inactivation. Nevertheless, the effect on quality parameters needs to be considered while optimizing the process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of BAIBA on the vascular endothelial cell function.The mRNA levels of proinflammatory molecules, antioxidants, and their related transcription regulators were examined by quantitative RT-PCR in BAIBA-treated human aortic or umbilical vein endothelial cells (HAEC or HUVEC, respectively), with or without tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α stimulation. The protein expression and phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were determined by Western blot analysis.BAIBA pretreatment significantly suppressed the mRNA levels of the adhesion molecules in the TNF-α-stimulated HAEC and HUVEC. BAIBA treatment significantly increased the mRNA levels of antioxidant molecules, catalase, superoxide dismutases, thioredoxin, and gamma-glutamylcysteine ligases, together with mitochondrial biogenesis-related molecules, nuclear respiratory factor 1, and mitochondrial transcription factor A. In addition, BAIBA treatment significantly increased the transcription factors that regulated these genes [i.e., peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-δ, PPAR-γ, estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC)-1β]. Adenovirus-mediated PGC-1β overexpression significantly increased the mRNA levels of all antioxidant molecules. The phosphorylation levels of AMPK and eNOS were unaltered by BAIBA.In vascular endothelial cells, BAIBA had antiatherogenic effects through the PGC-1β-ERRα/PPAR-δ and PPAR-γ pathway. This can explain the beneficial effects of exercise on vascular endothelial function.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

These proteins commonly prevent association of eIF4E with eIF4G or form repressive messenger ribonucleoproteins that exclude the translation machinery. Such gene-regulatory mechanisms in plants, and even the presence of eIF4E-interacting proteins other than eIF4G (and the plant-specific isoform eIFiso4G, which binds eIFiso4E), are unknown. Here, we report the discovery of a plant-specific protein, conserved binding of eIF4E 1 (CBE1). We found that CBE1 has an evolutionarily conserved eIF4E-binding motif in its N-terminal domain and binds eIF4E or eIFiso4E  CBE1 thereby forms cap-binding complexes and is an eIF4E-dependent constituent of these complexes  Of note, plant mutants lacking CBE1 exhibited dysregulation of cell cycle-related transcripts and accumulated higher levels of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in mitosis than did WT plants. Our findings indicate that CBE1 is a plant protein that can form mRNA cap-binding complexes having the potential for regulating gene expression. Because mammalian translation factors are known regulators of cell cycle progression, we propose that CBE1 may represent such first translation factor-associated plant-specific cell cycle regulator.© 2018 Patrick et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30100490>Comparative analysis of phytochemicals and activity of endogenous enzymes associated with their stability, bioavailability and food quality in five Brassicaceae sprouts.</a></h2><p>Five Brassicaceae sprouts (white cabbage, kale, broccoli, Chinese cabbage, arugula) were comparatively analyzed based on phytochemicals (polyphenols, glucosinolates, carotenoids, chlorophylls, ascorbic ) content and accompanying enzymes associated with phytochemical stability and bioavailability (peroxidases, myrosinase, and polyphenol-oxidase) that consequently impact food quality.

However, the contributions of dietary lipids to brain-adipose communication and adipose tissue function are poorly understood. We designed six custom diets that differed only in amount and type of dietary fat, with high or low levels of saturated fatty  (SFA), omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty  (n-6 PUFA) or omega-3 (n-3) PUFA. Mice fed the n-3 PUFA diet for 16 weeks displayed a striking reduction in weight gain accompanied by smaller adipose depots and improved glucose sensitivity. Reduced body weight occurred despite lowered energy expenditure and no difference in food intake. Despite the apparent beneficial effects to whole body physiology, we have demonstrated for the first time that a peroxidized n-3-enriched diet led to lipotoxicity of white adipose tissue, as evidenced by increased fibrosis, lipofuscin, reduced anti-inflammatory markers and loss of proper nerve supply. While healthful, n-3 fats are prone to peroxidation, and we observed peroxidated lipid metabolites in the adipose tissue of mice on these diets. Furthermore, using a lipidomics approach, we have observed that brain, white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue accumulate lipid metabolites differently. The brain remained mostly shielded from changes in dietary fat type and amount, but differences in adipose lipid metabolites across these six diets may have affected metabolic function and brain-adipose communication, as observed in this study.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that pHFD increases the inhibition of DMV neurons by disrupting GABA receptor subunit development. In vivo gastric recordings were made from adult anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats fed a control or pHFD (14 or 60% kcal from fat, respectively) from embryonic  (E13) to postnatal  (P42), and response to brainstem microinjection of benzodiazepines was assessed. Whole cell patch clamp recordings from DMV neurons assessed the functional expression of GABA α subunits, whereas mRNA and protein expression were measured via qPCR and Western blotting, respectively. pHFD decreased basal antrum and corpus motility, whereas brainstem microinjection of L838,417 (positive allosteric modulator of α subunit-containing GABA receptors) produced a larger decrease in gastric tone and motility. GABAergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in pHFD DMV neurons were responsive to L838,417 throughout development, unlike control DMV neurons, which were responsive only at early postnatal timepoints. Brainstem mRNA and protein expression of the GABA α and  subunits, however, did not differ between control and pHFD rats. This study suggests that pHFD exposure arrests the development of synaptic GABA α receptor subunits on DMV neurons and that functional synaptic expression is maintained into adulthood, although cellular localization may differ. The tonic activation of slower GABA α subunit-containing receptors implies that such developmental changes may contribute to the observed decreased gastric motility.  Vagal neurocircuits involved in the control of gastric functions, satiation, and food intake are subject to significant developmental regulation postnatally, with immature GABA receptors expressing slower α-subunits, whereas mature GABA receptor express faster α-subunits. After perinatal high-fat diet exposure, this developmental regulation of dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) neurons is disrupted, increasing their tonic GABAergic inhibition, decreasing efferent output, and potentially decreasing gastric motility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30295036>Formation of Phenolic Compounds from d-Galacturonic .</a></h2><p>Aqueous d-galacturonic  (d-GalA) model systems treated at 130 °C at different pH values show an intense color formation, whereas other reducing sugars, such as d-galactose (d-Gal), scarcely react.

To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying scald resistance, 'Granny Smith' apples after harvest were treated with diphenylamine (DPA) or 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), then cold stored (0 °C for 3 months) and subsequently were ripened at room temperature (20 °C for 8 days). Phenotypic and physiological data indicated that both chemical treatments induced scald resistance while 1-MCP inhibited the ethylene-dependent ripening. A combination of multi-omic analysis in apple skin tissue enabled characterization of potential genes, proteins and metabolites that were regulated by DPA and 1-MCP at pro-symptomatic and scald-symptomatic period. Specifically, we characterized strata of scald resistance responses, among which we focus on selected pathways including dehydroabietic  biosynthesis and UDP-D-glucose regulation. Through this approach, we revealed scald-associated transcriptional, proteomic and metabolic signatures and identified pathways modulated by the common or distinct functions of DPA and 1-MCP. Also, evidence is presented supporting that cytosine methylation-based epigenetic regulation is involved in scald resistance.

In nanocolloids consisting of a dispersion of nanoparticles in solution, colloidal stability is influenced by factors including the particle surface facet and capping layer, and local temperature, chemistry, and acidity. In this paper, we investigate colloidal stability through the real-time manipulation of nanoparticles using in situ liquid cell Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM). In a distribution of uniform iron oxide nanoparticles, we use the electron beam to precisely control the local chemistry of the solution and observe the critical role that surface chemistry plays in nanoparticle stability. By functionalizing the nanoparticle surfaces with charged amino  and peptides, stability can be tuned to promote dissolution, growth, or agglomeration, either permanently or reversibly.

The degradation of antioxidant activity, phenolic compounds, and ascorbic  followed first-order kinetics.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate and predict the quality characteristics of the fruits as affected by processing conditions.

The pathophysiology of cachexia is complex and poorly understood. Many molecular signaling pathways are involved in PC and cachexia. Though our understanding of cancer cachexia is growing, therapeutic options remain limited. Thus, further discovery and investigation of the molecular signaling pathways involved in the pathophysiology of cachexia can be applied to development of targeted therapies. This review focuses on three main pathophysiologic processes implicated in the development and progression of cachexia in PC, as well as their utility in the discovery of novel targeted therapies. Skeletal muscle wasting is the most prominent pathophysiologic anomaly in cachectic patients and driven by multiple regulatory pathways. Several known molecular pathways that mediate muscle wasting and cachexia include transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), myostatin and activin, IGF-1/PI3K/AKT, and JAK-STAT signaling. TGF-β antagonism in cachectic mice reduces skeletal muscle catabolism and weight loss, while improving overall survival. Myostatin/activin inhibition has a great therapeutic potential since it plays an essential role in skeletal muscle regulation. Overexpression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) leads to increased ubiquitination associated proteolysis, inhibition of myogenesis, and decreased muscle mass in PC induced cachexia. IGFBP-3 antagonism alleviates muscle cell wasting. Another component of cachexia is profound systemic inflammation driven by pro-cachectic cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon gamma (INF-γ). IL-6 antagonism has been shown to reduce inflammation, reduce skeletal muscle loss, and ameliorate cachexia. While TNF-α inhibitors are clinically available, blocking TNF-α signaling is not effective in the treatment of cancer cachexia. Blocking the synthesis or action of acute phase reactants and cytokines is a feasible therapeutic strategy, but no anti-cytokine therapies are currently approved for use in PC. Metabolic alterations such as increased energy expenditure and gluconeogenesis, insulin resistance, fat tissue , excessive oxidative stress, and proteolysis with amino  mobilization support tumor growth and the development of cachexia. Current innovative nutritional strategies for cachexia management include ketogenic diet, utilization of natural compounds such as silibinin, and supplementation with ω3-polyunsaturated fatty . Elevated ketone bodies exhibit an anticancer and anticachectic effect. Silibinin has been shown to inhibit growth of PC cells, induce metabolic alterations, and reduce myofiber degradation. Consumption of ω3-polyunsaturated fatty  has been shown to significantly decrease resting energy expenditure and regulate metabolic dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30060980>Progression of Geographic Atrophy in Age-related Macular Degeneration: AREDS2 Report Number 16.</a></h2><p>To analyze the prevalence, incidence, and clinical characteristics of eyes with geographic atrophy (GA) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), including clinical and genetic factors affecting enlargement.Prospective cohort study within a controlled clinical trial.Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) participants, aged 50-85 years.Baseline and annual stereoscopic color fundus photographs were evaluated for GA presence and area.

Of the remaining 6530 eyes at risk, 1099 eyes (17.3%) of 883 participants developed incident GA without prior neovascular disease during mean follow-up of 4.4 years. The Kaplan-Meier rate of incident GA was 19% of eyes at 5 years. In eyes with incident GA, 4-year risk of subsequent neovascular AMD was 29%.

In some fruit, such as tomato, higher anthocyanin concentrations enhance storage and shelf life. In contrast, highly anthocyanic red-fleshed apples ( x ) have an increased incidence of internal  flesh disorder (IBFD). To determine the mechanisms underlying this, 'Royal Gala' cultivar apples over-expressing the anthocyanin-related transcription factor (TF) MYB10 (35S:MYB10), which produces fruit with highly pigmented flesh, were compared with standard 'Royal Gala' Wild Type (WT) grown under the same conditions. We saw no incidence of IBFD in WT 'Royal Gala' but the over-expression of MYB10 in the same genetic background resulted in a high rate of IBDF. We assessed concentrations of potential substrates for IBDF and a comparison of metabolites in these apples showed that anthocyanins, chlorogenic , pro-cyanidins, flavon-3-ols, and quercetin were all higher in the MYB10 lines. For the flavol-3-ols sub-group, epicatechin rather than catechin was elevated in MYB10 lines compared with the control fruit. Internal ethylene concentrations were measured throughout fruit development and were significantly higher in 35S:MYB10 lines, and ethylene was detected at an earlier developmental stage pre-harvest.

However, the role of other neurotransmitters in BAT homeostasis remains largely unknown. Our metabolomic analyses reveal that gamma-aminobutyric  (GABA) levels are increased in the interscapular BAT of mice with dietary obesity.

The glucose treatment increased the hydrogen peroxide (HO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and caused oxidative stress in treated tissues. The lower HO content and oxidative stress was associated with an increased antioxidant enzyme activity in the SA-pretreated samples, which resulted in less membrane damage and improved growth and cell viability under the glucose treatment compared to the control. By reducing the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO), the SA pretreatment reduced the production and oxidation of phenolic compounds under the glucose treatment; this decrease was associated with less  of tissues and higher viability. Increases in taxol (5.1-fold) and total taxanes (3.5-fold) in the SA-pretreated calli cultured on the medium containing 2% glucose, compared to the control, indicated that the two treatments had a significant effect on taxane production in the T. baccata callus culture.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has been shown to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and prevents mitochondrial dysfunction in the progression of obesity-associated diseases. The aim of the study was to evaluate the mechanisms of UDCA during obesity-linked hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction and obesity-associated adipose tissue macrophage-induced inflammation in obese mice. UDCA significantly decreased lipid droplets, reduced free fatty  (FFA) and triglycerides (TG), improved mitochondrial function, and enhanced white adipose tissue  in  mice. This is associated with increased hepatic energy expenditure, mitochondria biogenesis, and incorporation of bile  metabolism (Abca1, Abcg1 mRNA and BSEP, FGFR4, and TGR5 protein). In addition, UDCA downregulated NF-κB and STAT3 phosphorylation by negative regulation of the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 signaling. These changes were accompanied by decreased angiogenesis, as shown by the downregulation of VEGF, VCAM, and TGF-βRII expression. Importantly, UDCA is equally effective in reducing whole body adiposity. This is associated with decreased adipose tissue expression of macrophage infiltration (CD11b, CD163, and CD206) and lipogenic capacity markers (lipofuscin, SREBP-1, and CD36). Furthermore, UDCA significantly upregulated adipose  in association with upregulation of SIRT-1-PGC1-α signaling in epididymis adipose tissue (EWAT). These results suggest that multi-targeted therapies modulate glucose and lipid biosynthesis fluxes, inflammatory response, angiogenesis, and macrophage differentiation. Therefore, it may be suggested that UDCA treatment may be a novel therapeutic agent for obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30100483>Rapid autographic method for detection of enzymatic  inhibitors based on enzyme immobilization.</a></h2><p>This work describes a TLC-coupled bioautographic assay suitable for the separation and detection of apple polyphenol oxidase (PPO) inhibitors from natural extracts. PPO was immobilised in agar containing l-DOPA as substrate and 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone hydrochloride (MBTH) to enhance colour development. The inhibition was detected as white spots on reddish background. Minimum amount of PPO inhibitors detected was 0.0125 µg of 4-hexylresorcinol, 0.025 µg of ascorbic , 0.5 µg of cysteine and 1 µg of kojic . The assay was compatible with normal and reverse phase TLC systems and allows detecting compounds that directly had action on the enzyme as well as agents that could convert quinones back to their reduced form. The chromatographic run evidenced the different nature of enzymatic  inhibitory compounds from garlic and onion extracts. Using natural enzymes will provide a fast and cheap alternative for target specific exploration of natural enzymatic inhibitors.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We carried out a detailed seasonal study of water chemistry, zooplankton diet, and MeHg accumulation in zooplankton in two lakes with contrasting tOM concentrations. Between-lake differences explained 51% of the variability in our water chemistry data, with no observed effect of season or sampling depth, contrary to our expectations. Higher tOM was correlated with higher aqueous Hg concentrations, lower areal pelagic primary productivity, and an increased contribution of terrestrial particles to pelagic particulate organic matter. Based on dietary marker analysis (δC, δN, and fatty  [FA] composition), zooplankton diet was strongly linked to feeding mechanism, with dietary reliance on phytoplankton highest in the selective-feeding calanoid copepods, and lowest in filter feeding cladocerans. Zooplankton dietary reliance on phytoplankton and their concentrations of high-quality lipids, including polyunsaturated fatty , were higher in the clear-water lake than in the brown-water lake, where bacterial and terrestrial food sources were more prevalent. MeHg was highest in zooplankton from the brown-water lake, with highest concentrations in the 200-500 μm zooplankton size fraction for both lakes. Contrary to our expectations, there was no effect of season on zooplankton dietary markers or MeHg. Our results suggest that, overall, higher tOM results in higher MeHg concentrations in water and zooplankton, and reduces zooplankton dietary reliance on phytoplankton. Increased tOM thus leads to a decrease in the nutritional quality of zooplankton (i.e. higher MeHg concentrations, and lower concentrations of essential fatty ), which may cascade up the food web with negative implications for higher trophic levels.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The heated fish protein in absent of glucose was also as controls. The lower glycation extent of fish protein, with a lower  intensity and bound sugar, enhanced the production of acetate and propionate. The formation of indole and ammonia was inhibited by the glycation of fish protein, but less affected by its glycation extent. Compared to FP, the glycation of fish protein significantly increased (p < .05) the relative abundance of genera Lactococcus for GFP24 (47%) and GFP48 (71%), whereas decreased dominant genera Bacteroides for GFP24 (32%) and GFP48 (23%). Compared to GFP24, GFP48 indicated significantly higher relative abundance of Holdemania, Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Lactobacillus, and lower amounts of Parabacteroides (p < .05). In the meantime, the heated treatments in the absent of glucose resulted in the increase of some genera Dialister, Arobacter, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Phascolarctobacterium and Veillonella, and also ammonia production. Furthermore, the correlation analysis confirmed that the glycation of fish protein for the decrease of ammonia and indole production was associated with the changes of some proteolytic bacteria genera, including Bacteroides, Dialister and Parabacteroides. Thus, the glycated fish protein rich in Amadori products greatly change the profiles of fermentation metabolite and gut microbiota, and these changes can have a potential impact on host health.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The blender apple juice showed a darker brown color and 4.5 times higher PPO activity than LSM apple juice. This result suggested that the blender caused severer damage to plastids in cells leading to leakage of PPO into the juice than the LSM juicer. The total polyphenol and flavonoid content of LSM apple juice was approximately 2 times higher than that of blender apple juice because polyphenols and flavonoids can be used as substrates by PPO. The antioxidant activity of LSM juice was higher than that of blender juice. Together, these results suggested that the LSM juicer is superior to the blender for preparation of fresh apple juices due to the minimization of enzymatic oxidation reactions.

Six- to eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were switched to HFD and, at the same time, received orally placebo or PTE (100 mg or 300 mg/kg body weight/day). Body weight, body composition, and food intake were monitored. After 26 days, blood and tissue samples were collected for biochemical, morphological, and gene expression analyses.

IB disorder begins in roots from approx. 90 days after transplanting, and the severity increases significantly with time. IB damage initially occurs in cells around the secondary vascular tissue, and the area per cell occupied by starch grains in this region was larger than in the unaffected region. High levels of reducing sugars, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities, chlorogenic , and hydrogen peroxide (HO) were detected in cells from the IB damaged regions. The content of sugar and polyphenols was higher in disks (transverse sections) with larger amounts of damaged tissues than in disks of sound root. The transcript levels of  invertase (IbAIV) tended to be higher with greater IB severity, whereas fluctuation patterns of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (IbAGPase), granule bound starch synthase (IbGBSS), and starch branching enzyme 1 (IbSBE1) were lower with higher IB severity. These observations suggest that the incidence of IB disorder in sweet potato is largely dependent on the excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells around the secondary vascular tissues due to the abundant accumulation of sugar and/or starch grains during the root maturation period.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The Maillard reaction products (MRPs) are widely produced in foods containing reducing sugars and amino-bearing compounds during thermal processing and storage. MRPs possess excellent antioxidant ability in many food products, through chelation of metal ions, breakdown of radical chains and hydrogen peroxide, and scavenging of reactive oxygen species. This review presents an overview of the antioxidant activity of MRPs in model and real food systems. It also provides the pros and cons of the Maillard reaction, some available antioxidant assays to evaluate the antioxidative ability of MRPs, and parameters influencing their functional properties.

Ingestion of taurine helps to improve obesity and its related metabolic disorders. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the protective role of taurine against obesity is not completely understood. In this study, it was found that intraperitoneal treatment of mice with taurine alleviated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, improved insulin sensitivity, and increased energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis of the mice. Meanwhile, administration of the mice with taurine markedly induced the  of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) with significantly elevated expression of PGC1α, UCP1, and other thermogenic genes in iWAT.  studies indicated that taurine also induced the development of brown-like adipocytes in C3H10T1/2 white adipocytes. Knockdown of PGC1α blunted the role of taurine in promoting the brown-like adipocyte phenotypes in C3H10T1/2 cells. Moreover, taurine treatment enhanced AMPK phosphorylation  and , and knockdown of AMPKα1 prevented taurine-mediated induction of PGC1α in C3H10T1/2 cells. Consistently, specific knockdown of PGC1α in iWAT of the HFD-fed mice inhibited taurine-induced  of iWAT, with the role of taurine in the enhancement of adaptive thermogenesis, the prevention of obesity, and the improvement of insulin sensitivity being partially impaired. These results reveal a functional role of taurine in facilitating the  of white adipose tissue, which depends on the induction of PGC1α.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) mediates production of heat while white adipose tissue (WAT) function in the storage of fat. Roles of BAT in the treatment of obesity and related disorders warrants more investigation. Peroxisome proliferator activator receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) is the master regulator of both BAT and WAT adipogenesis and has roles in glucose and fatty  metabolism. Adipose tissue is the major expression site for PPAR-γ. In this study, the effects of rosiglitazone on the brown adipogenesis and the association of MAPK and PI3K pathways was investigated during the in vitro adipogenic differentiation of telomerase transformed mesenchymal stromal cells (iMSCs). Our data indicate that 2 µM rosiglitazone enhanced adipogenesis by over-expression of PPAR-γ and C/EBP-α. More specifically, brown adipogenesis was enhanced by the upregulation of EBF2 and UCP-1 and evidenced by multilocular fatty droplets morphology of the differentiated adipocytes. We also found that rosiglitazone significantly activated MAPK and PI3K pathways at the maturation stage of differentiation.

Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we show that G protein-coupled bile -activated receptor 1 (GPBAR1) agonism reverses liver and vascular damage in mouse models of NASH. NASH is associated with accelerated vascular inflammation representing an independent risk factor for development of cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular-related mortality. GPBAR1, also known as TGR5, is a G protein-coupled receptor for secondary bile  that reduces inflammation and promotes energy expenditure. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we investigated whether GPBAR1 agonism by 6β-ethyl-3α,7β-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-ol (BAR501) reverses liver and vascular damage induced by exposure to a diet enriched in fat and fructose (HFD-F). Treating HFD-F mice with BAR501 reversed liver injury and promoted the  of white adipose tissue in a Gpbar1-dependent manner. Feeding HFD-F resulted in vascular damage, as shown by the increased aorta intima-media thickness and increased expression of inflammatory genes (IL-6,TNF-α, iNOS, and F4/80) and adhesion molecules (VCAM, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and endothelial selectin) in the aorta, while reducing the expression of genes involved in NO and hydrogen sulfide generation, severely altering vasomotor activities of aortic rings in an ex vivo assay.

Bacteria encode hundreds of transcription factors forming the base-level control of gene regulation. Moreover, highly homologous regulators are assumed to control conserved genes between members within a species that harbor the same genetic targets. We have explored this concept in 2  pathotypes that employ distinct virulence mechanisms that facilitate specification of a different niche within the host. Strikingly, we found that the transcription factor YhaJ actively regulated unique gene sets between intestinal enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC) and extraintestinal uropathogenic  (UPEC), despite being very highly conserved. In EHEC, YhaJ directly activates expression of type 3 secretion system components and effectors. Alternatively, YhaJ enhances UPEC virulence regulation by binding directly to the phase-variable type 1 fimbria promoter, driving its expression. Additionally, YhaJ was found to override the universal GAD  tolerance system but exclusively in EHEC, thereby indirectly enhancing type 3 secretion pleiotropically. These results have revealed that within a species, conserved regulators are actively repurposed in a "personalized" manner to benefit particular lifestyles and drive virulence via multiple distinct mechanisms.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

In this study, we clarified the mechanism of occurrence of the disorder by using two types of cultivars with different IB susceptibility. In cells around the secondary vascular tissue, large size of starch grains accumulated in IB-susceptible cultivar compared with resistant one. Histochemical observation performed on cells around the secondary vascular tissues showed the presence of high levels of polyphenol oxidase activity, chlorogenic , and hydrogen peroxide in cells from the IB-affected regions in IB-susceptible cultivar. Likewise, high levels of starch content, hydrogen peroxide concentration, and polyphenol content were detected in the affected regions of IB-susceptible cultivar. In IB-susceptible cultivar, both the transcript levels of gens related starch and polyphenol biosynthesis were higher at an early stage of root maturation, while the levels in resistant cultivar were low at this stage and thereafter increased relatively more moderately. These observations suggest that the occurrence of IB disorder in sweetpotato largely depends on the morphology and timing of accumulated starch grain in cells around the secondary vascular tissues.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, the mechanisms of acute cold-stimulated beige formation still remain largely unknown. Here, transcriptional analysis of acute cold-stimulated (4 °C for 4 h) subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) was conducted to determine the molecular signatures that might be involved in beige formation. Histological analysis confirmed the appearance of beige adipocytes in acute cold-treated sWAT. The RNA-sequencing data revealed that 714 genes were differentially expressed (-value < 0.05 and fold change > 2), in which 221 genes were upregulated and 493 genes were downregulated. Gene Ontology (GO) analyses showed that the upregulated genes were enriched in the GO terms related to lipid metabolic process, fatty  metabolic process, lipid oxidation, fatty  oxidation, etc. In contrast, downregulated genes were assigned the GO terms of regulation of immune response, regulation of response to stimulus, defense response, etc. The expressions of some  candidate genes were validated in cold-treated sWAT and 3T3-L1 cell  differentiation. In summary, our results illustrated the transcriptional response of sWAT to acute cold exposure and identified the genes, including , , , and , involved in beige adipocyte formation in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30442967>Insights into the Chemistry of Non-Enzymatic  Reactions in Different Ribose-Amino  Model Systems.</a></h2><p>Reactions between sugars and amino  in the Maillard reaction produce a multitude of compounds through interconnected chemical pathways. The course of the pathways changes depending on the nature of the amino  and sugars as well as the processing conditions (e.g. temperature, water activity). Some partial pathways have been elucidated using labelled precursors but the process is very time intensive. Here, we use rapid, non-targeted analysis with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) to deliver the molecular formulae and ion intensities of the compounds generated from reaction of four amino  with ribose (10 h at 100 °C) to study the effect of amino  side chains on the reaction pathways. Using van Krevelen diagrams, known chemical changes during the reaction (e.g. dehydration or decarboxylation) can be studied. Comparison of the data from the four amino  studied, showed a common pathway, which involved 73 Maillard reaction products (MRPs) where the differences were due only to the nature of the amino  side chain. From the more than 1400 different molecular formulae found, pathways unique to the amino  were also identified and the order of reactivity was lysine >cysteine >isoleucine ≈ glycine. While unequivocal identification of the compounds cannot be achieved with FT-ICR-MS, applying known chemical transformations found in the Maillard reaction, not only identifies new and known pathways, but also integrates the MRPs into a general Maillard reaction scheme that better represents the totality of the Maillard reaction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31442469>Effective degradation of the mycotoxin patulin in pear juice by porcine pancreatic lipase.</a></h2><p>Porcine pancreatic lipase (PPL) was used to degrade the mycotoxin patulin (PAT) in pear juice. The dosage of PPL, the initial concentration of PAT, reaction temperature and time were investigated by batch experiments to study the optimal degradation condition. The concentration of PAT in pear juice was determined by high performance liquid chromatography with an ultraviolet detector (HPLC-UV).

The objective of this study was to evaluate protective effects of fermented  extract by  ON188 (ONE) against hepatosteatosis and obesity in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed HFD mixed with ONE for four weeks and its effects on hepatosteatosis and obesity were examined. Although ONE did not change food intake, it reduced body weights of mice at administration dose of 200 mg/kg/day. Activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) as plasma parameters were reduced by ONE in a dose-dependent manner. Hepatic lipid droplets and triglyceride (TG) levels were also reduced by ONE due to upregulation of fatty  oxidizing genes such as carnithine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1) and peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor α(PPARα) mediated by induction of sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2). In epididymal fat tissue, sizes of adipocytes were significantly reduced by ONE in a dose-dependent manner. This is mainly due to suppression of lipogenesis and upregulation of adipocyte  genes. Collectively, these results suggest that fermented ONE can activate fatty  oxidation via SPHK2 in the liver. It can also suppress lipogenesis and activate  in adipose tissue. Thus, ONE might have potential to be used for the development of functional foods against liver dysfunction and obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30173742>Metabolite profiling of Mycoplasma gallisepticum mutants, combined with bioinformatic analysis, can reveal the likely functions of virulence-associated genes.</a></h2><p>Mycoplasma gallisepticum is an economically important pathogen of commercial poultry. An improved understanding of M. gallisepticum pathogenesis is required to develop better control methods. We recently identified a number of M. gallisepticum mutants with defects in colonization and persistence in chickens using signature-tagged transposon mutagenesis. Loss of virulence was associated with mutations in a putative oligopeptide/dipeptide (opp/dpp) ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter (where the transposon was inserted into the MGA_0220 (oppD) gene and two hypothetical proteins (encoded by MGA_1102 and MGA_0588), one of which (MGA_1102) contains a putative peptidase motif. To further characterise the function of these proteins, we compared the metabolome of each transposon mutant with that of wild type bacteria. Two independent LC/MS analyses revealed consistent significant decreases in the abundances of several amino  and the dipeptide alanyl-glycine (Ala-Gly) in the MGA_0220 mutant, consistent with this protein being a peptide transporter. Similarly, lysine and Ala-Gly were significantly decreased in the MGA_1102 mutant, consistent with our bioinformatic analysis suggesting that MGA_1102 encodes a membrane-located peptidase. Few differences were observed in metabolite levels in the MGA_0588 mutant, suggesting that the disrupted protein has a non-metabolic role. Overall, this study indicates that metabolomics is a useful tool in the functional analysis of mutants.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The thermal processing induces many chemical reactions, such as the Maillard reaction, which causes the color change from white to dark brown. Garlic contains a variety of amino , and the effect of each amino  on  is not fully understood. This work investigated the effect and mechanism of free amino  on the  of black garlic using model solutions containing garlic neutral polysaccharide, hydrolyzed garlic neutral polysaccharide, fructose, and free amino .A significant increase in reducing sugar was detected when garlic neutral polysaccharide was heated with glycine. The  intensity of garlic neutral polysaccharide-glycine model solution was obviously higher after heating at 80 °C compared with that of garlic neutral polysaccharide solution. The model solution containing histidine had the greatest  degree. The histidine model has a stable pH value, and almost no 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) was detected.Amino  can promote the breaking of the garlic neutral polysaccharide chain and can react with the fructose generated to form . Histidine has the greatest effect on the , because histidine could eliminate the inhibiting effect of organic  on Maillard reaction due to the buffer ability, and histidine had high reactivity in the late stage of Maillard reaction. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309828>Interaction of Added l-Cysteine with 2-Threityl-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic  Derived from the Xylose-Cysteine System Affecting Its Maillard .</a></h2><p>The Maillard reaction under a stepwise increase of temperature using l-cysteine as the indicator was performed to determine the formation conditions for the preparation of 2-threityl-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic  (TTCA) which was the main Maillard reaction intermediate (MRI) derived from the xylose (Xyl)-cysteine (Cys) model system in aqueous medium.

BAT-dependent non-shivering thermogenesis is attributed to uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)'s disengagement of oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis and dissipates energy as heat. Thus individuals with a substantial amount of BAT are better equipped during cold stress and less likely to become obese. Recently, our laboratory has shown pig adipocytes have no UCP1 protein. The inability of newborn piglets to generate heat contributed to its high death rate. Repairing the genetic defect of UCP1 in pig adipocytes has implications in defending against cold for piglets and developing an alternative treatment for human obesity.Q-PCR, western blotting (WB) and oxygen consumption measurement were used to enable functional UCP1 protein in preadipocytes. Immunoprecipitation (IP), chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP), and dual-luciferase reporter assay system were used to clarify the thermogenesis mechanism of functional UCP1.Only co-overexpressing mice UCP1 and pig PGC-1α increased not only the mitochondrial number but also the uncoupled respiration rate in the transfected pig adipocytes. The functional mice UCP1 increased the pig PGC-1α activity through the AMPK-SIRT1 pathway. The active form PGC-1α interacted with transcription factors Lhx8, Zic1, ERRα, and PPARα to regulate the expression of mitochondrial energy metabolism and adipocytes -related genes.Our data suggest a model in which pig PGC-1α and mice UCP1 work collaboratively to restore uncoupling respiration in pig preadipocytes. These results have great implications for piglet survival and developing an alternative treatment for human obesity in the future.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

Although numerous hydrogel bioinks have been developed, materials are still needed that mimic the cellular microenvironment, have the appropriate viscosity and stabilization for printing, and are cytocompatible. Here, we present a unique gallol-modified extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogel ink that is inspired by rapid fruit  phenomena. The gallol-modification of ECM components (e.g., hyaluronic , gelatin) allowed (i) immediate gelation and shear-thinning properties by dynamic hydrogen bonds on short time-scales and (ii) further auto-oxidation and covalent crosslinking for stabilization on longer time-scales. The gallol ECM hydrogel ink was printable using an extrusion-based 3D printer by exploiting temporal shear-thinning properties, and further showed cytocompatibility (∼95% viability) and on-tissue printability due to adhesiveness of gallol moieties. Printed cell-laden filaments degraded and swelled with culture over 6 days, corresponding to increases in cell density and spreading. Ultimately, this strategy is useful for designing hydrogel inks with tunable properties for 3D bioprinting. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: 3D bioprinting is a promising technique for the fabrication of cell-laden constructs for applications as in vitro models or for therapeutic applications. Despite the previous development of numerous hydrogel bioinks, there still remain challenging considerations in the design of bioinks. In this study, we present a unique cytocompatible hydrogel ink with gallol modification that is inspired by rapid fruit  phenomena. The gallol hydrogel ink has three important properties: i) it shows immediate gelation by dynamic, reversible bonds for shear-thinning extrusion, ii) it allows spontaneous stabilization by subsequent covalent crosslinking after printing, and iii) it is printable on tissues by adhesive properties of gallol moieties. As such, this work presents a new approach in the design of hydrogel inks.Copyright © 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study focused on the biochemical characteristics of PPOs from stored lentil sprouts, providing data that may be directly implemented in improving the consumer quality of sprouts. The purification resulted in approximately 25-fold enrichment of two PPO isoenzymes (PPO I and PPO II). The optimum pH for total PPOs, as well as for PPO I and PPO II isoenzymes, was 4.5-5.5, 4.5-5.0, and 5.5, respectively. The optimal temperature for PPOs was 35 °C. Total PPOs and the PPO I and PPO II isoenzymes had the greatest affinity for catechol ( = 1.32, 1.76, and 0.94 mM, respectively). Ascorbic  was the most effective in the inhibition of dark color formation by total PPOs, and showed ca. 62%, 43%, and 24% inhibition at 20-, 2-, and 0.2-mM concentrations.

Changes in bile  physiology and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling are suspected mediators of postoperative NASH improvement. Recent experimental evidence suggests that upregulation of hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) activity might also impact NASH improvement. As FXR partly regulates PPARα, we compared resolution of NASH and changes in hepatic PPARα and FXR gene expression following Diet and RYGB.We searched the Gene Expression Omnibus database to identify human studies with liver biopsies containing genomic data and histologic NASH features, at baseline and after Diet or RYGB. Microarray data were extracted for PPARα and FXR gene expression analyses using GEOquery R package v.2.42.0.We identified one study (GSE83452) where patients underwent either Diet (n = 29) or RYGB (n = 25). NASH prevalence was similar at baseline (Diet 76% versus RYGB 60%, P = ns). After 1 year, NASH resolved in 93.3% of RYGB but only in 27.3% of Diet (P < 0.001).

Physical exercise stimulates the secretion of myokines, such as b-aminoisobutyric  (BAIBA), which in turn promotes adaptive thermogenesis. White adipocyte conversion to brown cells involves dynamic changes in lipid droplet (LD) dimension and in the transcription of brown-specific marker genes. This study analyzes the effect of different doses of BAIBA and at different days of development on 3T3-L1 cells by evaluating morphological changes in LDs and the expression of  gene markers. Results suggested that the highest concentration of BAIBA after 4 days of differentiation produced the most significant effects. The number of LDs per cell increased in comparison to control cells, whereas the surface area significantly decreased. Brown adipocyte markers were up-regulated, but the effect of treatment was lost at 10 days of differentiation. The thermogenic program induced by BAIBA may reflect a rapid adaptation of adipose tissue to physical exercise. This connection stresses the beneficial impact of physical exercise on metabolic health.

The accumulation of succinate in macrophages is known to activate a pro-inflammatory program; however, the contribution of SUCNR1 to macrophage phenotype and function has remained unclear. Here we found that activation of SUCNR1 had a critical role in the anti-inflammatory responses in macrophages. Myeloid-specific deficiency in SUCNR1 promoted a local pro-inflammatory phenotype, disrupted glucose homeostasis in mice fed a normal chow diet, exacerbated the metabolic consequences of diet-induced obesity and impaired adipose-tissue  in response to cold exposure. Activation of SUCNR1 promoted an anti-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages and boosted the response of these cells to type 2 cytokines, including interleukin-4. Succinate decreased the expression of inflammatory markers in adipose tissue from lean human subjects but not that from obese subjects, who had lower expression of SUCNR1 in adipose-tissue-resident macrophages. Our findings highlight the importance of succinate-SUCNR1 signaling in determining macrophage polarization and assign a role to succinate in limiting inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295637>Effects of melatonin treatment on the enzymatic  and nutritional quality of fresh-cut pear fruit.</a></h2><p>The effects of exogenous melatonin treatment on the enzymatic  and nutritional quality of fresh-cut pear fruit were investigated.

Obesity today is one of the world's greatest health challenges. Little is known about the extent of involvement of the white adipose tissue (WAT) in sepsis and how it is being modified by obesity. We sought to explore the involvement of the WAT in sepsis. We hypothesize that sepsis induces  of the WAT and that obesity alters the response of WAT to sepsis. Six-week-old C57BL/6 mice were randomized to a high-fat diet to induce obesity (obese group) or control diet (nonobese group). After 6 to 11 weeks of feeding, polymicrobial sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Mice were sacrificed at 0, 18, and 72 h after CLP and epididymal WAT (eWAT), inguinal WAT, and brown adipose tissue (BAT) harvested. Both types of WAT were processed for light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy to assess for morphological changes in both obese and nonobese mice. Tissues were processed for immunohistochemistry, image analyses, and molecular analyses. BATs were used as a positive control. Nonobese mice have an extensive breakdown of the unilocular lipid droplet and smaller adipocytes in WAT compared with obese mice after sepsis. Neutrophil infiltration increases in eWAT in nonobese mice after sepsis but not in obese mice. Nonobese septic mice have an increase in mitochondrial density compared with obese septic mice. Furthermore, nonobese septic mice have an increase in uncoupling protein-1 expression. Although the WAT of nonobese mice have multiple changes characteristic of  during sepsis, these changes are markedly blunted in obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30405587>Viability of  on Fresh-Cut Chitosan and Alginate-Coated Apple and Melon Pieces.</a></h2><p>There is an increasing trend toward foods with probiotics; the awareness of healthy diet and wellbeing is the leading cause of this increase. As a result, food producers and stakeholders require new probiotic products. The increased incidence of lactose intolerance and the new lifestyles (vegan and vegetarian styles) have led to a renewed interest in non-dairy probiotic carriers. The use of biopolymeric matrices to develop active food packaging carrying probiotics has been studied and proposed as an alternative method to design new solutions. The main topic of this paper was the design of fresh-cut fruits (apples and melons) as carriers for a promising ; fruit pieces were coated with either alginate or chitosan. Apple (Granny Smith) and melon pieces (, var. ) were preliminary treated with an anti- solution (citric and ascorbic ). Then, fruit pieces were dipped in a solution containing  c19 (9 log cfu/ml) and coated with alginate or chitosan. Samples without probiotic and/or coatings were used as controls. All samples were stored at 4°C for 14 days under air or modified atmosphere (65% N, 30% CO, and 5% O); the following analyses were done: pH, color, O and CO in the head space, microbiology (mesophilic bacteria, lactic  bacteria, yeasts, and molds). The most important results can be summarized as follows: (a) Alginate coating showed better performances than chitosan-coating, as it did not affect the viability of . (b) The inoculation of probiotics in the controls negatively affected the color, but the coating was able to counteract this effect.

Hence, tyrosinase inhibitors are important in the fields of medicine, cosmetics and agriculture. In this study, novel N-(2-morpholinoethyl)cinnamamide derivatives bearing different substituents on phenyl ring were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their tyrosinase diphenolase inhibitory activity. The compounds were found to be better tyrosinase inhibitors (ICs were in micro molar range) than cinnamic . (E)-3-(3-chlorophenyl)-N-(2-morpholinoethyl)acrylamide (B6) exhibited the highest inhibition with IC value of 15.2 ± 0.6 μM which was comparable to that of kojic . The inhibition kinetic analysis of B6 indicated that the compound was a mixed-type tyrosinase inhibitor. In silico ADME prediction indicated that B6 might show more skin penetration than kojic . Molecular docking analysis confirmed that the active inhibitors well accommodated in the mushroom tyrosinase active site and it was also revealed that B6 formed the most stable drug-receptor complex with the target protein. Therefore, cinnamamide B6 could be introduced as a potent tyrosinase inhibitor that might be a promising lead in cosmetics, medicine and food industry.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the contents of nutritional compositions including proteins, fats, carbohydrates, organic , and amino  were determined in SAV samples. The antioxidant compounds and properties of SAV with different aging time were also evaluated. The results showed that the contents of proteins, crude fats, and carbohydrates in SAV were not changed with the aging time. Moreover, Alanine was the main component of amino  in SAV, and the total contents of amino  were increased with the aging time. Acetic  and lactic  were the predominant organic  in SAV. The contents of acetic  and lactic  accounted for more than 90% of the total organic  in SAV, which were increased during the aging process of 5 years.

Nonetheless, the direct correlation between dietary AP and their effects in adipose tissues remained unclear. In this study, male C57BL/6 mice were fed with low-fat diet, HFD with or without 0.04% (w/w) AP for 12 weeks. Dietary AP ameliorated HFD induced body weight gain, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. Energy expenditure was increased with no influence on energy intake, which indicated us that AP prevented obesity by enhancing energy export. Interestingly, AP activated lipolysis (ATGL/FOXO1/SIRT1) without higher cycling free fatty  (FFAs). FFAs were consumed by the upregulation of fatty  oxidation (AMPK/ACC), thermogenesis, and  (UCP-1, PGC-1α). Additionally, adipose tissue metabolic inflammation (NF-кB, MAPK) was also reduced by AP.

Treatment of HUVECs and THP-1 cells with BAIBA inhibited the LPS-induced phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. In HUVECs, expression of adhesion molecules and LPS-stimulated adhesion of THP-1 cells to the endothelium were significantly decreased after BAIBA treatment.

Disrupted GH/GHR actions not only fail growth but also are involved in many metabolic disorders, as shown in murine models with global or tissue-specific Ghr deficiency and clinical observations. Here we constructed an adipose-specific Ghr knockout mouse model Ad-GHRKO and studied the metabolic adaptability of the mice when stressed by high-fat diet (HFD) or cold. We found that disruption of adipose Ghr accelerated dietary obesity but protected the liver from ectopic adiposity through free fatty  trapping. The heat-producing brown adipose tissue burning and white adipose tissue  induced by cold were slowed in the absence of adipose Ghr but were recovered after prolonged cold acclimation. We conclude that at the expense of excessive subcutaneous fat accumulation and lower emergent cold tolerance, down-tuning adipose GHR signaling emulates a healthy obesity situation which has metabolic advantages against HFD.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

We performed both BAT transplantation as well as extirpation experiments in the mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. We carried out immune cell profiling in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) isolated from epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT). BAT transplantation reversed HFD-induced increase in body weight gain and insulin resistance without altering diet intake. Importantly, BAT transplantation attenuated the obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation in terms of decreased pro-inflammatory M1-macrophages, cytotoxic CD8a T-cells and restored anti-inflammatory regulatory T-cells (Tregs) in the eWAT. BAT transplantation also improved endogenous BAT activity by elevating protein expression of  markers (UCP-1, PRDM16 and PGC1α) in it. In addition, BAT transplantation promoted the eWAT expression of various genes involved in fatty  oxidation (such as Elvol3 and Tfam,). In contrast, extirpation of the interscapular BAT exacerbated HFD-induced obesity, insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation (by increasing M1 macrophages, CD8a T-cell and decreasing Tregs in eWAT).

A total of 154 genes were significantly regulated after ABA treatment, with 99 up-regulated and 55 down-regulated, respectively.

Rapid post-harvest pericarp  strictly limits litchi fruit marketing. In the current research, we hypothesized that modification of litchi fruit pericarp anatomy by hormone application may reduce fruit susceptibility to post-harvest pericarp . In this context, we hypothesized that cytokinin treatment, known to induce cell division, may yield fruit with thicker pericarp and reduced susceptibility for fruit surface micro-crack formation, water loss and post-harvest pericarp . Exogenous cytokinin treatment was applied at different stages along the course of litchi fruit development and the effect on fruit pericarp anatomy, fruit maturation and postharvest pericarp  was investigated. Interestingly, cytokinin treatment, applied 4 weeks after full female bloom (WFB), during the phase of pericarp cell division, led to mature fruit with thicker pericarp, reduced rate of post-harvest water loss and reduced susceptibility to post-harvest pericarp , as compared to non-treated control fruit. Histological sections ascribe the difference in pericarp anatomy to increased cell proliferation in the parenchymatic tissue and the highly-lignified brachysclereid cell layer. In contrast, exogenous cytokinin treatment applied 7 WFB, following the phase of pericarp cell division, significantly increased epidermal-cell proliferation but had no significant effect on overall fruit pericarp thickness and only minor affect on post-harvest water loss or pericarp . Interestingly, the late cytokinin treatment also significantly postponed fruit maturation-associated anthocyanin accumulation and chlorophyll degradation, as previously reported, but had no effect on other parameters of fruit maturation, like total soluble sugars and total titratable  typically modified during aril maturation. In conclusion, exogenous cytokinin treatment at different stages in fruit development differentially modifies litchi fruit pericarp anatomy by induction of cell-type specific cell proliferation. Early cytokinin treatment during the phase of pericarp cell division may prolong litchi fruit storage by reducing fruit susceptibility to post-harvest water loss and pericarp .Copyright © 2019.

Our recent study with a gene/stress mouse model provided evidence to support the ability for the maternal supplement of DHA to alleviate autism-associated behavior in the offspring. DHA and arachidonic  (ARA) are substrates of enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions, and lipid peroxidation results in the production of 4-hydroxyhexenal (4-HHE) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), respectively. In this study, we examine whether a maternal DHA-supplemented diet alters fatty  (FAs), as well as lipid peroxidation products in the pup brain, heart and plasma by a targeted metabolite approach. Pups in the maternal DHA-supplemented diet group showed an increase in DHA and a concomitant decrease in ARA in all brain regions examined. However, significant increases in 4-HHE, and not 4-HNE, were found mainly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Analysis of heart and plasma showed large increases in DHA and 4-HHE, but a significant decrease in 4-HNE levels only in plasma. Taken together, the DHA-supplemented maternal diet alters the (n-3)/(n-6) FA ratio, and increases 4-HHE levels in pup brain, heart and plasma. These effects may contribute to the beneficial effects of DHA on neurodevelopment, as well as functional changes in other body organs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30403851>The Changes in Metabolisms of Membrane Lipids and Phenolics Induced by Phomopsis longanae Chi Infection in Association with Pericarp  and Disease Occurrence of Postharvest Longan Fruit.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the changes in metabolisms of membrane lipids and phenolics caused by Phomopsis longanae Chi infection in association with pericarp  and fruit disease occurrence of postharvest longans.

"Xiaobai" and "Daliguang"). The NFT storage temperatures for the "Xiaobai" apricot and "Daliguang" apricot were determined as -1.9 to -2.3°C and -1.2 to -1.6°C, respectively. Storage at NFT significantly improved the storage quality of apricots by suppressing respiration rate, ethylene production, decay rate, internal  index, membrane permeability, and malondialdehyde content. Apricots stored at NFT maintained higher firmness, total soluble solids, titrable , total phenolics, total flavonoids, and ascorbic  content than those stored at 0-1°C. Additionally, NFT storage enhanced the capacity of radical scavenging and metal chelating, antioxidant properties in apricots compared to those stored at 0-1°C. Hence, NFT storage proved to be an effective method to improve the quality and antioxidant attributes of apricots. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study explored the effect of storage at near freezing temperature (NFT) on the postharvest quality of two cultivars of apricot (var. "Xiaobai" and "Daliguang"). We found that storage for 70 days at NFT resulted in better edible quality compared to storage at 0-1°C and 4-6°C. Apricot quality was determined in terms of respiration rate, ethylene production, decay rate, internal  index, membrane permeability, malondialdehyde content, firmness, total soluble solids, titrable , total phenolics, total flavonoids, and ascorbic  content. The antioxidant properties of the fruits were also retained during storage at NFT.

The purpose of the current investigation was to determine if glucagon was required for the effects of cold on WAT . Utilizing whole-body glucagon receptor knockout (Gcgr) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermate controls, we examined the response of inguinal WAT (iWAT) and interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) to an acute (48 h) cold stress or challenge with the β3-adrenergic agonist CL316,243. The effects of glucagon alone on the induction of thermogenic genes in adipose tissue from C57BL6/J mice were also examined. Gcgr mice displayed modest increases in indices of  at room temperature while displaying a blunted induction of Ucp1, Cidea, and Ffg21 mRNA expression in iWAT following cold exposure. Similarly, cold induced increases in mitochondrial DNA copy number, and the protein content of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, UCP1, and PGC1α were attenuated in iWAT from Gcgr mice. In BAT, the induction of thermogenic markers following cold exposure was reduced, but the effect was less pronounced than in iWAT. Glucagon treatment increased the expression of thermogenic genes in both iWAT and BAT of C57BL6/J mice. In response to CL316,243, circulating fatty , glycerol, and the phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase were attenuated in iWAT of Gcgr mice. We provide evidence that glucagon is sufficient for the induction of thermogenic genes in iWAT, and the absence of intact glucagon signaling blunts the cold-induced  of WAT, possibly due, in part, to impaired adrenergic signaling.-Townsend, L.

Numerous research works have provided wide evidence regarding the effects of prebiotics on the protection against different detrimental phenotypes related to cancer, immunity, and features of the metabolic syndrome, among others. Nonetheless, one topic less studied so far, but relevant, relates to the connection between prebiotics and energy metabolism regulation (and the prevention or treatment of obesity), especially by means of their impact on adaptive (non-shivering) thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and in the  of white adipose tissue (WAT). In the present review, a key link between prebiotics and the regulation of adaptive thermogenesis and lipid metabolism (in both BAT and WAT) is proposed, thus connecting prebiotic consumption, microbiota selection (especially gut microbiota), production of microbiota metabolites, and the regulation of energy metabolism in adipose tissue, particularly regarding the effects on  promotion, or on BAT recruitment. In this sense, various types of prebiotics, from complex carbohydrates to phenolic compounds, have been studied regarding their microbiota-modulating role and their effects on crucial tissues for energy metabolism, including adipose tissue. Other studies have analyzed the effects of the main metabolites produced by selected microbiota on the improvement of metabolism, such as short chain fatty  and secondary bile . Here, we focus on state-of-the-art evidence to demonstrate that different prebiotics can have an impact on energy metabolism and the prevention or treatment of obesity (and its associated disorders) by inducing or regulating adaptive thermogenic capacity in WAT and/or BAT, through modulation of microbiota and their derived metabolites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847736>Changes in Bile  Metabolism, Transport, and Signaling as Central Drivers for Metabolic Improvements After Bariatric Surgery.</a></h2><p>We review current evidence regarding changes in bile  (BA) metabolism, transport, and signaling after bariatric surgery and how these might bolster fat mass loss and energy expenditure to promote improvements in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).The two most common bariatric techniques, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), increase the size and alter the composition of the circulating BA pool that may then impact energy metabolism through altered activities of BA targets in the many tissues perfused by systemic blood. Recent reports in human patients indicate that gene expression of the major BA target, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), is increased in the liver but decreased in the small intestine after RYGB. In contrast, intestinal expression of the transmembrane G protein-coupled BA receptor (TGR5) is upregulated after surgery. Despite these apparent conflicting changes in receptor transcription, changes in BAs after both RYGB and VSG are associated with elevated postprandial systemic levels of fibroblast growth factor 19 (from FXR activation) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (from TGR5 activation). These signaling activities are presumed to support fat mass loss and related metabolic benefits of bariatric surgery, and this supposition is in agreement with findings from rodent models of RYGB and VSG. However, inter-species differences in BA physiology limit direct translation and mechanistic understanding of how changes in individual BA species contribute to post-operative improvements of T2D and NAFLD in humans. Thus, details of all these changes and their influences on BAs' biological actions are still under scrutiny. Changes in BA physiology and receptor activities after RYGB and VSG likely support weight loss and promote sustained metabolic improvements.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31140724>Differential Anti-Adipogenic Effects of Eicosapentaenoic and Docosahexaenoic  in Obesity.</a></h2><p>To assess the associations of plasma eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) with body fat in a population-based sample and explore the mechanism of action based on  of white adipose tissue (WAT) in high-fat-diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and 3T3-L1 adipocytes.Plasma EPA and DHA of 1719 adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-2004) are determined by gas chromatography mass spectrometry, while total body fat is measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. DIO mice are fed a high-fat diet supplemented with EPA or DHA (1% wt/wt) for 15 weeks and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes are treated with EPA or DHA during differentiation. Plasma DHA but not EPA is associated with lower body fat mass (p < 0.0001), which persists in overweight/obese subjects (p = 0.02). DHA supplementation reduces inguinal WAT and exhibits a more pronounced thermogenic effect than EPA in DIO mice. In vitro, the  process is induced after 2-day and 6-day treatment with DHA and EPA, respectively.Plasma DHA but not EPA is inversely associated with body fat mass.

The mitochondrial respiratory capacity was higher in CT adipose tissue, particularly at the level of complex II of the electron transport chain (2.2-fold increase; P < 0.01). This higher activity was paralleled by an increase in mitochondrial number (CT compared with control: 784 ± 27 compared with 675 ± 30 mitochondrial DNA molecules per cell; P < 0.05). No evidence for uncoupled respiration or "" of the white adipose tissue was found. In accordance with the mitochondrial differences, CT subjects had a distinct adipose transcriptomic profile [62 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate of 0.1 and log fold change >0.75)], with many differentially expressed genes associating with positive metabolic outcomes.

In order to reduce sugar and maintaining the product quality at the same time, functional ingredients and alternative sweetening agents have to be incorporated. In this study, the sourdough lactic  bacteria Leuconostoc citreum TR116, selected for its ability to produce high amounts of mannitol, was used to produce wheat sourdough and its biochemical characteristics (cell count, pH, TTA, sugar- and  profile, as well as mannitol production) were monitored over 48 h. The so produced sourdough was then incorporated, as a functional ingredient, into a sugar reduced burger bun system and the quality characteristics of the dough and the final product were determined. Sourdough incorporation counteract the negative effects of sugar reduction on dough properties and resulted in the same viscoelastic properties (0.423 ± 0.008) and gluten-network-development (PMT: 160 ± 12.6 s; TM: 44.0 ± 2.6 BU) as the full-sugar control dough. Furthermore, the investigation of specific volume, crumb hardness and chewiness revealed no significant differences between sugar reduced sourdough burger buns and its control. It is noteworthy that sourdough contributed to  reaction resulting in darker crumb and crust colour (-8.2%; -9.6%) and it extended microbial shelf life of the burger buns significantly (+3.5 days). Sensory evaluation showed no significant differences in sweetness and sourness between sugar reduced buns containing sourdough and the full-sugar control. In conclusion, the incorporation of mannitol-rich sourdough fermented by Leuconostoc citreum TR116 represents a novel technological approach in the field of sugar reduction and showed high potential as a functional ingredient to ameliorate the losses of important quality parameters. Especially sourdough containing higher amounts of mannitol and lower amounts of lactate improved significantly the dough and burger bun quality.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Our approach is based on mathematical modeling of reaction data to derive the rate constants of reactions of A-ring quenching vs B-ring electron transfer with caffeic  quinone, by fitting the predicted loss of precursors and the appearance of products (or derivatives) with experimental data collected by LC/MS. The rate constant of the electron transfer reaction of caffeic  quinone towards 4-methyl-catechol was fast (k  = 3.43E-2 mLmolsec) but nucleophilic reactions with afzelechin (k  = 2.53E-3 mLmolsec) or malvidin-3-glucoside (k  = 5.34E-3 mLmolsec), were much slower. No reaction was detected between caffeic  quinone and isorhamnetin. Additionally, the electron transfer reaction rate of catechin and caffeic  quinone was much faster at pH 7 (1.22E-02 mLmolsec) vs pH 3.5 (1.79E-03 mLmolsec). These results help explain why the reaction of catechin and caffeic  quinone favors the formation of  products, and more so at higher pH values. Furthermore, bisulfite reacted with quinones faster than the electron transfer reactions, preventing the  observed in the reaction of catechin with caffeic  quinone in the absence of bisulfite.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Oil yield, oxidative stability index (OSI), radical scavenging activity (RSA), and Maillard reaction products were increased while peroxide value (PV) and conjugated dienes were decreased in oil of peanuts roasted at 180 °C for 10 min. Oils extracted mechanically from roasted peanuts had lower PV while higher OSI and RSA than the solvent-extracted oils. The fatty  composition of oils from roasted peanuts (at 160 and 180 °C for 10 min) changed slightly compared to unroasted peanuts. The level of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and non-enzymatic  index was significantly increased in oil from peanuts roasted at 180 °C for 10 min. FTIR spectra showed a slight change in peak intensities with no observed peak shift in oils extracted from peanuts roasted at 180 °C for 10 min. Based on the results obtained, mechanically extracted oil from peanuts roasted at 180 °C for 10 min improves oil quality characteristics and enhances oxidative stability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31213276>A combined metabolomic and bioinformatic approach to investigate the function of transport proteins of the important pathogen Mycoplasma bovis.</a></h2><p>Mycoplasma bovis is an economically important pathogen of the cattle industry worldwide, and there is an urgent need for a more effective vaccine to control the diseases caused by this organism. Although the M. bovis genome sequence is available, very few gene functions of M. bovis have been experimentally determined, and a better understanding of the genes involved in pathogenesis are required for vaccine development. In this study, we compared the metabolite profiles of wild type M. bovis to a number of strains that each contained a transposon insertion into a putative transporter gene. Transport systems are thought to play an important role in survival of mycoplasmas, as they rely on the host for many nutrients. We also performed C-stable isotope labelling on strains with transposon insertions into putative glycerol transporters. Integration of metabolomic and bioinformatic analyses revealed unexpected results (when compared to genome annotation) for two mutants, with a putative amino  transporter (MBOVPG45_0533) appearing more likely to transport nucleotide sugars, and a second mutant, a putative dicarboxylate/amino :cation (Na or H) symporter (DAACS), more likely to function as a biopterin/folate transporter. This study also highlighted the apparent redundancy in some transport and metabolic pathways, such as the glycerol transport systems, even in an organism with a reduced genome. Overall, this study highlights the value of metabolomics for revealing the likely function of a number of transporters of M. bovis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Interactions between secretory factors from adipose tissues and the nervous system innervating adipose tissues play key roles in maintaining energy metabolism and promoting survival in response to metabolic challenges. It is currently accepted that there are three types of adipose tissues, white (WAT), brown (BAT), and beige (BeAT), all of which play essential roles in maintaining energy homeostasis. WAT mainly stores energy under positive energy balance, while it releases fuels under negative energy balance. Thermogenic BAT and BeAT dissipate energy as heat under cold exposure to maintain body temperature. Adipose tissues require neural and endocrine communication with the brain. A number of WAT adipokines and BAT batokines interact with the neural circuits extending from the brain to cooperatively regulate whole-body lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. We review neuroanatomical, histological, genetic, and pharmacological studies in neuroendocrine regulation of adipose function, including lipid storage and mobilization of WAT, non-shivering thermogenesis of BAT, and  of BeAT. Recent whole-tissue imaging and transcriptome analysis of differential gene expression in WAT and BAT yield promising findings to better understand the interaction between secretory factors and neural circuits, which represents a novel opportunity to tackle obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585271>Synthesis and anti-tyrosinase mechanism of the substituted vanillyl cinnamate analogues.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to synthesize and screen tyrosinase inhibitors for delay fruit . A series of vanillyl cinnamate analogues were designed and synthesized by simple processes, and the inhibitory effects of all the synthesized derivatives on mushroom tyrosinase were evaluated. In the enzymatic activity test, compounds 21, 22, and 26 had significant (P < 0.05) effect on mushroom tyrosinase at a preliminary screening dose (1 mg/mL in vitro). IC analysis showed that the IC values of compounds 21, 22 and 26 were 268.5 μM, 213.2 μM and 413.5 μM, respectively. In the cytotoxicity evaluation, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay showed that compounds 21, 22 and 26 had no significant effect on the proliferation of hepatocyte L02 and B16 melanoma cells at the dosage of 25-200 μM. Inhibition of tyrosinase activity and melanin content in B16 melanoma cells investigations indicated that compounds 21, 22 and 26 inhibited both cellular tyrosinase activity and melanin content dose-dependently and more strongly than the reference standard arbutin. The UV-visible spectra showed compound 22 inhibits the formation of dopamine quinone, further the molecular docking analysis of compound 22 with tyrosinase (PDB: 2Y9X) indicated that compound 22 interacted with the amino  residues of tyrosinase. The results of anti- test showed that compounds 21, 22 and 26 had significant tyrosinase inhibition and anti- effects on fresh-cut apple slices at 4 °C in 48 h.

The aim was to offer the most significant contributions concerning fresh-cut fruit preservation, using 'Shahmive' pear as the fruit model.

However, for hypermetabolic conditions stemming from burn trauma or cancer cachexia,  is thought to contribute to energy wasting and supraphysiological nutritional requirements. Metformin's impact on this phenomenon and underlying mechanisms have not been explored.We used both a murine burn model and human ex vivo adipose explants to assess metformin and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)'s effects on the development of subcutaneous beige adipose. Enzymes involved in fat homeostasis and , as well as mitochondrial dynamics, were assessed to determine metformin's effects.Treatment with the biguanide metformin lowers lipolysis in beige fat by inducing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) independently of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation. Increased PP2A activity catalyzes the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser 79) and hormone sensitive lipase (Ser 660), thus promoting fat storage and the "whitening" of otherwise lipolytic beige adipocytes. Moreover, co-incubation of metformin with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic  countered the anti-lipolytic effects of this biguanide in human adipose. Additionally, we show that metformin does not activate this pathway in the WAT of control mice and that AICAR sustains the  of white adipose, offering further evidence that metformin acts independently of this cellular energy sensor.This work provides novel insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of metformin's therapeutic benefits and potential as an agent to reduce the lipotoxicity associated with hypermetabolism and adipose .Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we investigated the  effect of black raspberry ( Miquel) using in vitro and in vivo models. Black raspberry water extract (BRWE) treatment inhibited lipid accumulation in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and zebrafish. To evaluate the thermogenic activity, BRWE was orally administered for 2 weeks, and then, the mice were placed in a 4 °C environment. As a result, BRWE treatment increased rectal temperature and inguinal WAT (iWAT) thermogenesis by inducing the expression of beige fat specific markers such as PR domain zinc-finger protein 16 (PRDM16), uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α), and t-box protein 1 (TBX1) in cold-exposed mice. Furthermore, ellagic  (EA), a constituent of BRWE, markedly promoted beige specific markers: UCP1, PGC1α, TBX1, and nuclear respiratory factor 1 in beige differentiation media (DM)-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our findings indicate that BRWE can promote beige differentiation/activation, and EA is the active compound responsible for such effect.

Obesity with increased body weight is often associated with white adipose tissue (WAT) hypertrophy and hyperplasia and/or beige/brown adipose tissue atrophy and aplasia, which significantly contribute to the imbalance in lipid metabolism, adipocytokine secretion, free fatty  release, and mitochondria function. In recent studies, hyperactive autophagy in WAT was observed in obese and diabetic patients, and inhibition of adipose autophagy through targeted deletion of autophagy genes in mice improved anti-obesity phenotypes. In addition, active mitochondria clearance through activation of autophagy was required for beige/brown fat whitening - that is, conversion to white fat. However, inhibition of autophagy seemed detrimental in hypermetabolic conditions such as hepatic steatosis, atherosclerosis, thermal injury, sepsis, and cachexia through an increase in free fatty  and glycerol release from WAT. The emerging concept of white fat -conversion to beige/brown fat-has been controversial in its anti-obesity effect through facilitation of weight loss and improving metabolic health. Thus, proper regulation of autophagy activity fit to an individual metabolic profile is necessary to ensure balance in adipose tissue metabolism and function, and to further prevent metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. In this review, we summarize the effect of autophagy in adipose tissue  in the context of obesity prevention and its potential as a promising target for the development of anti-obesity drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31107292>Prospects for pharmacotherapies to treat alcohol use disorder: an update on recent human studies.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to provide an update on medication development efforts for alcohol use disorder (AUD) by reviewing recently published (past 2 years) human studies that evaluated medications' effects on alcohol-related outcomes.Forty-five publications were found suitable for this review. A variety of compounds have been tested in the past 2 years as potential pharmacological options for AUD, including medications that act on multiple targets (topiramate, aripiprazole, quetiapine), calcium channels (gabapentin), gamma-Aminobutyric  receptors (baclofen, diazepam), glutamate receptors (ifenprodil, memantine, glycine), nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (varenicline, mecamylamine), α1 adrenergic receptors (prazosin, doxazosin), neuroendocrine pathways (oxytocin, a vasopressin receptor 1b antagonist, a ghrelin receptor inverse agonist) and others (samidorphan, ibudilast, N-acetylcysteine, citoline). Important findings and limitations regarding the effects of these medications on alcohol-related outcomes are discussed.There is a critical need to increase the armamentarium of medications for AUD.

Some intervention studies have demonstrated that eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) increase systemic concentrations of n-3 PUFA-derived oxylipins and moderately decrease arachidonic -derived oxylipins. There is no information on the dose-response of oxylipin concentrations after n-3 PUFA intake.The aim of this study was to quantify oxylipins in human plasma samples from an intervention study in which participants were randomly assigned to different daily intakes of EPA and DHA for 12 mo.Healthy adult men and women with low habitual fish consumption (n = 121) were randomly assigned to receive capsules providing doses of n-3 PUFAs reflecting 3 patterns of consumption of oily fish [1, 2, or 4 portions/wk with 3.27 g EPA + DHA (1:1.2, wt:wt) per portion] or placebo. Oxylipins were quantified in plasma after 3 and 12 mo. Relative and absolute changes of individual oxylipins were calculated and concentrations were correlated with the dose and the content of EPA and DHA in blood lipid pools.Seventy-three oxylipins, mostly hydroxy-, dihydroxy-, and epoxy-PUFAs, were quantified in the plasma samples. After 3 and 12 mo a linear increase with dose was observed for all EPA- and DHA-derived oxylipins. Cytochrome-P450-derived anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective epoxy-PUFAs increased linearly with n-3 PUFA dose and showed low interindividual variance (r2 > 0.95). Similarly, 5, 12-, and 15-lipoxygenase-derived hydroxy-PUFAs as well as those formed autoxidatively increased linearly. These include the precursors of so-called specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), e.g., 17-hydroxy-DHA and 18-hydroxy-EPA.Plasma concentrations of biologically active oxylipins derived from n-3 PUFAs, including epoxy-PUFAs and SPM-precursors, increase linearly with elevated intake of EPA and DHA.

Poly(ethyl acrylate- co-methacrylic ) microgels were synthesized and functionalized with biotin to enable the formation of microgel multilayers cross-linked with avidin. Microgel functionalization and avidin cross-linking were verified with infrared spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and z-potential measurements, while multilayer formation (up to four layers) was studied with null ellipsometry and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D). Incorporation of the antimicrobial peptide KYE28 (KYEITTIHNLFRKLTHRLFRRNFGYTLR) into the microgel multilayers was achieved either in one shot after multilayer formation or through addition after each microgel layer deposition. The latter was found to strongly promote peptide incorporation. Further, antimicrobial properties of the peptide-loaded microgel multilayers against Escherichia coli were investigated and compared to those of a peptide-loaded microgel monolayer. Results showed a more pronounced suppression in bacterial viability in suspension for the microgel multilayers. Correspondingly, LIVE/DEAD staining showed promoted disruption of adhered bacteria for the KYE28-loaded multilayers. Taken together, cross-linked microgel multilayers thus show promise as high load surface coatings for antimicrobial peptides.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553232>GDF5 Promotes White Adipose Tissue Thermogenesis via p38 MAPK Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>Growth differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) was reported to regulate brown adipogenesis; however, its effects on insulin sensitivity, full metabolic syndrome spectrum, and the thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) have not been elucidated yet. We thus generated fatty -binding protein 4 (Fabp4)-GDF5 transgenic (TG) mice and showed that GDF5 TG mice developed a relative lean phenotype on a high-fat diet (HFD) and showed increased insulin sensitivity. Over expression of GDF5 in adipose tissues greatly promoted the thermogenic process in sWAT after cold or β3-agonist treatment. In TG mice, sWAT showed an important thermogenic effect as the thermogenic gene expression was markedly increased, which was consistent with the typical features of beige adipocytes. Moreover, knockdown of the protein GDF5 impaired  program in sWAT after thermogenic stimuli. Enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) signaling was also identified in sWAT of HFD-fed GDF5 mice, and thermogenesis in mature adipocytes induced by GDF5 protein could be partly blocked by a p38 MAPK inhibitor. Taken together, our data suggest that GDF5 could improve insulin sensitivity and prevent metabolic syndrome, the adaptive thermogenesis in sWAT could mediate the obesity resistance effects of GDF5 in mice and partially resulted in the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30977140>Maillard reaction derived from oil-tea camellia seed through roasting.</a></h2><p>The Maillard reaction products (MRPs) formed after roasting of oil-tea camellia seeds (camellia seeds) were investigated. Camellia seeds are inevitably heated during processing, but the effect of heating or roasting on the physicochemical properties of camellia seed or oil-tea camellia seed oil (camellia oil) has been seldom studied, especially with respect to the Maillard reaction.Changes in reducing sugars, free amino , pH, color,  intensity and MRP (furosine, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and furural) concentrations were examined in camellia seeds during roasting at 120-160 °C for 20-120 min. Results showed that roasting leads first to a decrease and then to a considerable increase in free amino groups and, at the same time, to a reduction in moisture content and decrease in pH. The sucrose content of the seeds decreased, while that of glucose and fructose increased reciprocally during roasting. On the other hand, the observed changes concerning glyoxal were negligible. Furthermore, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural have been found at the end of the roasting process, with maximum values of 572.26 ± 1.91 mg kg dry wt and 0.46 ± 0.003 mg kg dry wt, at 160 °C for 120 min, respectively.This investigation provides the initial groundwork necessary for the development and implementation of green and efficient technology that could be applied to obtain high-quality camellia oil.

Among them, bacterial canker of apricot is exceedingly difficult to control due to a lack of efficient prophylactic measures. Several sources of partial resistance have been identified among genetic resources but the underlying genetic pattern has not been elucidated thus far. In this study, we phenotyped bacterial canker susceptibility in an apricot core-collection of 73 accessions over 4 years by measuring canker and superficial  lengths issued from artificial inoculations in the orchard. In order to investigate the genetic architecture of partial resistance, we performed a genome-wide association study using best linear unbiased predictors on genetic (G) and genetic x year (G × Y) interaction effects extracted from linear mixed models. Using a set of 63,236 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers genotyped in the germplasm over the whole genome, multi-locus and multi-variate mixed models aimed at mapping the resistance while controlling for relatedness between individuals.We detected 11 significant associations over 7 candidate loci linked to disease resistance under the two most severe years. Colocalizations between G and G × Y terms indicated a modulation on allelic effect depending on environmental conditions. Among the candidate loci, two loci on chromosomes 5 and 6 had a high impact on both canker length and superficial , explaining 41 and 26% of the total phenotypic variance, respectively. We found unexpected long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD) between these two markers revealing an inter-chromosomal LD block linking the two underlying genes. This result supports the hypothesis of a co-adaptation effect due to selection through population demography. Candidate genes annotations suggest a functional pathway involving abscisic , a hormone mainly known for mediating abiotic stress responses but also reported as a potential factor in plant-pathogen interactions.Our study contributed to the first detailed characterization of the genetic determinants of partial resistance to bacterial canker in a Rosaceae species.

The systemic increase of free fatty  (FFA) due to burn-induced lipolysis and subsequent organ fatty infiltration may culminate in multiple organ dysfunction and ultimately, death. Thus, reducing WAT lipolysis to diminish the mobilization of FFAs may render an effective means to improve outcomes post-burn. Here, we investigated the metabolic effects of Acipimox, a clinically approved drug that suppresses lipolysis via inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Using a murine model of thermal injury, we show that specific inhibition of HSL with Acipimox effectively suppresses burn-induced lipolysis in the inguinal WAT leading to lower levels of circulating FFAs at 7 days post-burn (p < 0.05). The FFA substrate shortage indirectly repressed the thermogenic activation of adipose tissue following injury, reflected by the decrease in protein expression of key  markers, UCP-1 (p < 0.001) and PGC-1α (p < 0.01). Importantly, reduction of FFA mobilization by Acipimox significantly decreased liver weight and intracellular fat accumulation (p < 0.05), suggesting that it may also improve organ function post-burn. Our data validate the pharmacological inhibition of lipolysis as a potentially powerful therapeutic strategy to counteract the detrimental metabolic effects induced by burn.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042041>Targeted Metabolomics Analysis and Identification of Biomarkers for Predicting  of Fresh-Cut Lettuce.</a></h2><p>The metabolism of phenolic compounds is a key factor in the development of wound-induced enzymatic  of fresh-cut lettuce.

White adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) are the two main forms of adipose tissue in humans. WAT functions as an endocrine organ and serves as a reservoir of energy in the form of triglycerides. The hormones released by WAT are called adipokines. BAT consists of a group of specialized cells with abundant uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in the inner mitochondrial membrane and also fulfills endocrine functions. Following the identification of functional (BAT) in human adults, there has been a great deal of interest in finding out how it is induced, its localization, and the mechanisms by which it regulates thermogenesis. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a key regulator of the differentiation to brown adipocytes. The main mechanisms occur through enhancing UCP1 expression. In addition, following exposure to cold or exercise, FGF21 induces upregulation of local peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator (PGC)-1-alfa and thus promotes thermogenesis in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. FGF21 integrates several pathways allowing the regulation of human energy balance, glucose levels, and lipid metabolism. Such mechanisms and their clinical relevance are summarized in this review.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530905>The key role of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in body fat redistribution.</a></h2><p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are an ideal therapy for type 2 diabetes and, as of recently, for obesity. In contrast to visceral fat, subcutaneous fat appears to be protective against metabolic diseases. Here, we aimed to explore whether liraglutide, a GLP-1RA, could redistribute body fat via regulating lipid metabolism in different fat depots. After being fed a high-fat diet for 8 weeks, 50 male Wistar and Goto-Kakizaki rats were randomly divided into a normal control group, a diabetic control group, low- and high-dose liraglutide-treated groups and a diet-control group. Different doses of liraglutide (400 μg/kg/day or 1200 μg/kg/day) or an equal volume of normal saline were administered to the rats subcutaneously once a day for 12 weeks. Body composition and body fat deposition were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and MRI. Isotope tracers were infused to explore lipid metabolism in different fat depots. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analyses were conducted to evaluate the expression of adipose-related genes. The results showed that liraglutide decreased visceral fat and relatively increased subcutaneous fat. Lipogenesis was reduced in visceral white adipose tissue (WAT) but was elevated in subcutaneous WAT. Lipolysis was also attenuated, and fatty  oxidation was enhanced. The mRNA expression levels of adipose-related genes in different tissues displayed similar trends after liraglutide treatment. In addition, the expression of -related genes was upregulated in subcutaneous WAT. Taken together, the results suggested that liraglutide potentially redistributes body fat and promotes  remodeling in subcutaneous WAT to improve metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285014>Changes in the physicochemical properties and flavour compounds of beef bone hydrolysates after Maillard reaction.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the changes in physicochemical properties and volatile compounds of beef bone hydrolysates during heat treatment as a result of the Maillard reaction (MR). Five beef bone hydrolysates obtained from single (P-Protamex®, B-bromelain, and F-Flavourzyme®) and simultaneous (P + F and B + F) enzymatic hydrolysis treatments were combined with ribose in aqueous solutions and heated at 113 °C to produce Maillard reaction products (MRPs). Total free amino  decreased after heat treatment indicating the occurrence of the MR. MRPs showed a decrease in pH and an increase in  intensity as the degree of hydrolysis of hydrolysates increased. The volatiles compounds generated during heat treatment were evaluated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) sampling. A total of 40 volatile compounds were identified in all MRPs and their concentration were found to increase with increasing degree of hydrolysis. Pyrazines were the most abundant class of compounds produced as a result of the MR. F-MRP showed the highest peak area intensity for 17 volatile compounds in single hydrolysis treatment followed by heat treatment. There was also no significant difference in those major volatile compounds between F-MRP and P + F-MRP or B + F-MRP from simultaneous hydrolysis treatment after heating.

In this study, 2-aminoindane-2-phosphonic  (AIP), an inhibitor of the polyphenol production-required enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), and different antibiotics were tested to control tea explant necrosis and . These compounds were supplemented in the regular plant growth medium together with 6-benzylaminopurine and thidiazuron at different concentrations. Our data indicated that application of 2 µM of AIP was able to effectively inhibit callus , significantly reduce EGC abundance, and greatly improve callus induction and growth. Moreover, the use of 150 mg/L of timentin and 30 mg/L gentamycin resulted in an effective elimination of the surface and endophytic microbes associated with explants of  var. .

The discovery of three different shades of adipose tissues has implications in terms of understanding the pathogenesis and potential interventions for obesity and its related complications. Fat , as well as activation of brown adipocytes and new beige adipocytes differentiated from adipogenic progenitor cells, are emerging as interesting and promising methods to curb obesity because of their unique capacity to upregulate non-shivering thermogenesis. This capacity is due to catabolism of stored energy to generate heat through the best characterized thermogenic effector uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). A variety of phytochemicals have been shown in the literature to contribute to thermogenesis by acting as chemical uncouplers, UCP1 inducers or regulators of fat differentiation and . In this review, we summarize the mechanisms and strategies for targeting adipose-mediated thermogenesis and highlight the role of phytochemicals in targeting adipose thermogenesis to fight against obesity. We also discuss proposed targets for how these phytochemical molecules promote BAT activity, WAT  and beige cell development, thereby offering novel insights into interventional strategies of how phytochemicals may help prevent and manage obesity via adipose thermogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Results showed that 0.3 g L PAS-Na significantly inhibited the development of pericarp  and reduced respiration rate of litchi fruit. PAS-Na inhibited the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased the expression level of senescence-related genes. Additionally, PAS-Na treatment enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX), which might contribute to the scavenging of ROS. Meanwhile, PAS-Na treatment maintained membrane integrity as indicated by reduced relative membrane leakage rate and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, as well as lower activities of membrane lipids-degrading enzymes: lipase and lipoxygenase (LOX). Amino , especially GABA, Glu, Met contents were also significantly affected by PAS-Na treatment. Taken together, we postulated that PAS-Na treatment might be a promising method for controlling postharvest  and prolonging shelf-life of harvested litchi fruit.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A series of veratric  derivatives containing benzylidene-hydrazine moieties with different substitutions were synthesized and their inhibitory effect on mushroom tyrosinase and free radical scavenging activity were evaluated. The results indicated that N'-(4-chlorobenzylidene)-3,4-dimethoxybenzohydrazide (D5) and N'-(2,3-dihydroxybenzylidene)-3,4-dimethoxybenzohydrazide (D12) showed the highest tyrosinase inhibitory activity with IC values of 19.72 ± 1.84 and 20.63 ± 0.79 μM, respectively, that were comparable with the IC value of kojic  (19.08 ± 1.21 μM). D12 was also a potent radical scavenger with EC value of 0.0097 ± 0.0011 mM. The free radical scavenging activity of D12 was comparable with the standard quercetin. The inhibition kinetic analyzed by Lineweaver-Burk plots revealed that compound D5 was a competitive tyrosinase inhibitor. Molecular docking study was carried out for the derivatives demonstrating tyrosinase inhibitory activity. D5 and D12 possessed the most negative estimated free energies of binding in mushroom tyrosinase active site.

Functional deficiency of tyrosinase results in serious dermatological diseases. Tyrosinase also participates in neuromelanin formation in the human brain, which leads to neurodegeneration resulting in Parkinson's disease. In fruits and vegetables, tyrosinase plays a critical role in senescence, causing undesired  that results in faster deterioration and shorter shelf lines. The only commercially available tyrosinase is mushroom tyrosinase and it shows the highest homology to the mammalian tyrosinase. Although kojic  is currently used as a tyrosinase inhibitor, they have serious side effects such as dermatitis, carcinogenesis and hepatotoxicity. Therefore, in order to develop a more active and safer tyrosinase inhibitor, 3D QSAR pharmacophore models were generated based on experimentally known inhibitors. The pharmacophore model, Hypo1, was developed with a large cost difference, high correlation coefficient and low RMS deviation. Hypo1 showed a good spatial arrangement; consisting of five-point features including two hydrogen bond acceptor, one hydrogen bond donor and two hydrophobic features. Hypo1 was further validated by cost analysis, test set and Fisher's randomisation method. Hypo1 was used as a 3D query for screening the in-house drug-like databases, and the hits were further selected by applying ADMET, Lipinski's rule of five and fit value criteria. To identify binding conformations, the obtained hits were subjected to molecular docking. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations revealed the appropriate binding modes of hit compounds. To conclude, we propose the final three hit compounds with new structural scaffolds as a virtual candidate as tyrosinase inhibitors. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

In the surface color measurement, increase in the b* value which is an indicator for Maillard  of the dried squid was mitigated at pH 4.0-6.0 and accelerated at pH 7.5-9.0. Adjusting the pH to 5.5 effectively suppressed increasing of the b* value (p < 0.05). Arginine (Arg) generation involved in the Maillard reaction, was inhibited in the dried squid at pH 5.5 (p < 0.05). Maillard reactivities between ribose and amino  were lower at pH 4.0 than at pH 5.5 (p < 0.05). These results indicate that  of the dried squid is significantly suppressed at pH 5.5.

During the lytic cycle, phage gene transcription is initiated from three promoters: P1 and P2, which control the expression of the early phage genes involved in genome replication and P3, which controls the expression of the late genes responsible for virion maturation and host lysis. Unlike most temperate phages, GIL01 lysogeny is not maintained by a dedicated phage repressor but rather by the host's regulator of the SOS response, LexA. Previously we showed that the lytic cycle was induced by DNA damage and that LexA, in conjunction with phage-encoded protein gp7, repressed P1. Here we examine the lytic/lysogenic switch in more detail and show that P3 is also repressed by a LexA-gp7 complex, binding to tandem LexA boxes within the promoter. We also demonstrate that expression from P3 is considerably delayed after DNA damage, requiring the phage-encoded DNA binding protein, gp6. Surprisingly, gp6 is homologous to LexA itself and, thus, is a rare example of a LexA homologue directly activating transcription. We propose that the interplay between these two LexA family members, with opposing functions, ensures the timely expression of GIL01 phage late genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30807212>Novel regulatory roles of carboxylesterase 3 in lipid metabolism and  in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes.</a></h2><p>The role of carboxylesterase 3 (Ces3) in the lipolysis of adipocytes has been overlooked, as 2 major lipolytic enzymes, hormone-sensitive lipase and adipose triglyceride lipase, play more powerful roles in lipolysis. In this study, we explored the effects of Ces3 in lipid metabolism by activating and inhibiting, as well as silencing, Ces3-encoding gene in 3T3-L1 cell model. Our results demonstrated that activation of Ces3 increased adipogenesis, and attenuated lipogenesis, whereas it promoted lipolysis and fatty  oxidation. In addition, activated Ces3 led to enhanced expression of core fat  marker genes and proteins, suggesting that Ces3 may play a pivotal role in fat  and thermogenesis. In contrast, deficiency of  nullified the  effect in white adipocytes, along with decreased adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Interestingly, the expression pattern of adipose triglyceride lipase was in line with Ces3, whereas hormone-sensitive lipase was independently regulated irrespective of Ces3 expression levels, suggesting that Ces3 may play an important and compensatory role in the breakdown of triglycerides in white adipocytes. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence that activation of Ces3 contributes in the  of white adipocytes, and maintains a balance in lipid metabolism, which could be a potential strategy in fighting against obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31054678>Postharvest hot air and UV-C treatments enhance aroma-related volatiles by simulating the lipoxygenase pathway in peaches during cold storage.</a></h2><p>Hot air (HA) treatment and ultraviolet C (UV-C) irradiation have been demonstrated to control chilling injury in peaches. However, little is known about the effects of HA and UV-C treatments on volatiles changes in peach fruit during cold storage. In this study, peaches were treated with HA at 40 °C for 4 h or irradiated with UV-C lamp (1.5 kJ/m), and then stored at 1 °C for 35 days plus 3 days of shelf life at 20 °C.

Additionally, the effect of combination treatment on juice quality was determined by measuring the changes in color, pH, non-enzymatic  index, and total phenolic content. A mixed cocktail of the three pathogens was inoculated into apple juice, followed by treatment with US (40 kHz) alone, FA (0.05, 0.1, and 0.15%) alone, and a combination of US and FA for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min. Combined US and 0.15% FA treatment for 5 min achieved 5.67, 6.35, and 3.47 log reductions in E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhimurium, and L. monocytogenes, respectively, with the 1.55, 2.37, and 0.57 log CFU reductions attributed to the synergistic effect. Although the pH value slightly decreased as FA increased, there were no significant (P > 0.05) differences in color values,  indices, and phenolic content between untreated and treated samples. To identify the mechanism of this synergistic bactericidal action, membrane integrity, malfunctions in the membrane efflux pump, and intracellular enzyme activity were measured. The analyses confirmed that damage to the cell envelope (membrane integrity and efflux pump) was strongly related to the synergistic microbial inactivation. These results suggest that simultaneous application of US treatment and FA is a novel method for ensuring the microbial safety of apple juice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Ellagic  (EA), located abundantly in plant extracts and fruits, has been shown to modulate formation and differentiation of adipocytes, although its role in the process of  of white adipose tissue (WAT) has not been elucidated. In this study, fifty-six five-week old SD rats were randomly assigned to receive normal diet (ND, 10% lipids) or high-fat diet (HFD, 60% lipid) with or without various dosages of EA for 24 weeks. Our results showed that high fat diet intake triggered overweight, glucose intolerance and white adipocyte hypertrophy, the effects of which were mitigated by EA treatment. Meanwhile, EA supplementation reduced serum resistin levels, improved hepatic steatosis and serum lipid profile in DIO (high fat diet induced obesity) rats. Moreover, EA supplementation significantly decreased mRNA expression of Zfp423 and Aldh1a1, the key determinants of WAT plasticity. EA also increased mRNA expression of brown adipocyte markers including UCP1, PRDM16, Cidea, PGC1α, Ppar-α; beige markers including CD137and TMEM26; mitochondrial biogenesis markers including TFAM in inguinal WAT (iWAT) when compared to their counterparts. EA treatment significantly improved mitochondrial function, as measured by citrate synthase activity. More importantly, EA markedly elevated the expression of UCP1 in iWAT, which is a specific protein of brown adipocyte. In conclusion, our results provided evidence that EA improved obesity-induced dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis in DIO rats via  of iWAT through suppressing white adipocyte maintaining genes and promoting expression of key thermogenic genes.

Thermodynamic parameters of enzymes, including the melting point (T ) and ∆G values, were obtained from thermal and chemical denaturation curves. Complexes I and II showed a competitive inhibitory effect on MT with K values of 0.45 and 0.29 mM, respectively. The T values were calculated as 328.6, 322.4, and 318 K and the ∆G values as 62.8, 52.9, and 47.1 KJ mol for the enzyme alone and its interaction with complexes I and II, respectively. Intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence techniques showed structural instability of the enzyme in concomitance with a decrease in the regular secondary structure acquired using CD spectrometry. This data clearly prove that the new derivatives show a stronger inhibitory effect than the separate compounds. Molecular docking analysis showed that the best possible interaction condition was achieved for chrysin with n-6. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: MT is a suitable model in medicine for the investigation of melanogenesis, skin disorders, and hyperpigmentation because of its accessibility and close structural similarity to mammalian tyrosinase. In recent years, the designing of tyrosinase inhibitors from natural substances for prevention of hyperpigmentation in medicine, skin cosmetics, and undesired  in agriculture and food industry has risen sharply.

Here, we examined the physiological and metabolic effects of the deficiency of these two bile  receptors on hepatic metabolism and injury in mice. Fxr/Tgr5 double knockout mice (DKO) were generated for metabolic phenotyping. Male DKO mice fed a chow diet had reduced liver lipid levels but increased serum cholesterol levels. Liver cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) activity and sterol 12α-hydroxylase mRNA levels were induced, while ileum FXR target genes were suppressed in DKO mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Bile  pool size was increased in DKO mice, with increased taurocholic  and decreased tauromuricholic . RNA sequencing analysis of the liver transcriptome revealed that bile  synthesis and fibrosis gene expression levels are increased in chow-fed DKO mice compared to WT mice and that the top regulated pathways are involved in steroid/cholesterol biosynthesis, liver cirrhosis, and connective tissue disease. Cholestyramine treatment further induced Cyp7a1 mRNA and protein in DKO mice and increased bile  pool size, while cholic  also induced Cyp7a1 in DKO mice, suggesting impaired bile  feedback regulation. A Western diet containing 0.2% cholesterol increased oxidative stress and markers of liver fibrosis but not hepatic steatosis in DKO mice. Conclusion: FXR and TGR5 play critical roles in protecting the liver from inflammation and fibrosis, and deficiency of both of these bile  receptors in mice increased cholic  synthesis and the bile  pool, liver fibrosis, and inflammation; FXR and TGR5 DKO mice may be a model for liver fibrosis.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30951282>Interaction of Laponite with Membrane Components-Consequences for Bacterial Aggregation and Infection Confinement.</a></h2><p>The antimicrobial effects of Laponite nanoparticles with or without loading of the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 was investigated along with their membrane interactions. The study combines data from ellipsometry, circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, particle size/ζ potential measurements, and confocal microscopy. As a result of the net negative charge of Laponite, loading of net positively charged LL-37 increases with increasing pH. The peptide was found to bind primarily to the outer surface of the Laponite nanoparticles in a predominantly helical conformation, leading to charge reversal. Despite their net positive charge, peptide-loaded Laponite nanoparticles did not kill Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria or disrupt anionic model liposomes. They did however cause bacteria flocculation, originating from the interaction of Laponite and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Free LL-37, in contrast, is potently antimicrobial through membrane disruption but does not induce bacterial aggregation in the concentration range investigated. Through LL-37 loading of Laponite nanoparticles, the combined effects of bacterial flocculation and membrane lysis are observed. However, bacteria aggregation seems to be limited to Gram-negative bacteria as Laponite did not cause flocculation of Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis bacteria nor did it bind to lipoteichoic  from bacterial envelopes. Taken together, the present investigation reports several novel phenomena by demonstrating that nanoparticle charge does not invariably control membrane destabilization and by identifying the ability of anionic Laponite nanoparticles to effectively flocculate Gram-negative bacteria through LPS binding. As demonstrated in cell experiments, such aggregation results in diminished LPS-induced cell activation, thus outlining a promising approach for confinement of infection and inflammation caused by such pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30108210>Non-linear response of summertime marine productivity to increased meltwater discharge around Greenland.</a></h2><p>Runoff from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is thought to enhance marine productivity by adding bioessential iron and silicic  to coastal waters. However, experimental data suggest nitrate is the main summertime growth-limiting resource in regions affected by meltwater around Greenland. While meltwater contains low nitrate concentrations, subglacial discharge plumes from marine-terminating glaciers entrain large quantities of nitrate from deep seawater. Here, we characterize the nitrate fluxes that arise from entrainment of seawater within these plumes using a subglacial discharge plume model. The upwelled flux from 12 marine-terminating glaciers is estimated to be >1000% of the total nitrate flux from GrIS discharge. This plume upwelling effect is highly sensitive to the glacier grounding line depth. For a majority of Greenland's marine-terminating glaciers nitrate fluxes will diminish as they retreat. This decline occurs even if discharge volume increases, resulting in a negative impact on nitrate availability and thus summertime marine productivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31379744>A Possible Mechanism: Genistein Improves Metabolism and Induces White Fat  Through Modulating Hypothalamic Expression of , and .</a></h2><p>Bioactive food components have gained growing attention in recent years. Multiple studies demonstrated that genistein had beneficial effects on metabolism. However, the exact mechanism by which genistein improves metabolism remains unclear, especially the central regulation. This study was designed to evaluate whether addition of genistein to the high-fat diet could counter metabolic disorders and whether these alterations were associated with gene expression in hypothalamus. C57BL/6 mice were fed either a high-fat diet (HF), high-fat diet with genistein (0.25 g/kg diet) (HFG) or a normal control diet (CON) for 8 weeks. Body weight was assessed during the study. After 8-week intervention, content of inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), perirenal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) were weighed. Glucose tolerance test, the serum levels of insulin and lipid were assessed. The mRNA of  marker was detected in the white fat. The hypothalamus was collected for whole transcriptome sequencing and reverse transcription quantitative PCR validation. The results demonstrated that mice fed HFG diet had lower body weight and SAT mass, decrease levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and free fatty , higher  marker of  and  in WAT and an improvement in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity compared with those in HF group. Transcriptome sequencing showed that there were three differentially expressed genes in hypothalamus among the three groups, including , and , which were significantly correlated with the  markers in WAT and insulin sensitivity. Thus, regulating gene expressions in hypothalamus is a potential mechanism for genistein improving metabolism and inducing WAT , which may provide a novel target for the precaution and treatment of T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30857341>Effects of a Lysine-Involved Maillard Reaction on the Structure and In Vitro Activities of Polysaccharides from Longan Pulp.</a></h2><p>The effects of amino -involved Maillard reactions (MRs) on the structure and activities of longan pulp polysaccharides (LPs), which were heteropolysaccharides mainly composed of glucose, galactose, mannose, rhamnose, glucuronic , ribose, and galacturonic , were investigated. The changes of  degree and molecular weight () distribution in the MR systems containing LPs and amino  (lysine, proline, or glycine) indicated that lysine was more active in conjugating with LPs. The MR-modified LPs (MLPs) obtained via a 4 h MR between LPs and lysine showed obvious structural differences from LPs. Specifically, particle-like LPs contained 94% fractions with a  less than 7.07 kDa, by contrast, network-like MLPs contained 45% fractions with a  larger than 264.1 kDa. Moreover, MLPs showed stronger radical scavenging abilities and macrophage immunostimulating effects, but weaker cancer cell growth-inhibitory abilities.

Whereas chronically elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in adipose tissue contribute to insulin resistance, transient ROS elevation stimulates physiological processes such as adipogenesis. Here, using a combination of biochemical and cell and molecular biology-based approaches, we studied whether ROS or antioxidant treatment affects β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR) stimulation-induced adipose tissue . We found that β3-AR stimulation increases ROS levels in cultured adipocytes, but, unexpectedly, pretreatment with different antioxidants (-acetylcysteine, vitamin E, or GSH ethyl ester) did not prevent this ROS increase. Using fluorescent probes, we discovered that the antioxidant treatments instead enhanced β3-AR stimulation-induced mitochondrial ROS production. This pro-oxidant effect of antioxidants was, even in the absence of β3-AR stimulation, associated with decreased oxygen consumption and increased lactate production in adipocytes. We observed similar antioxidant effects in WT mice: -acetylcysteine blunted β3-AR stimulation-induced  of white adipose tissue and reduced mitochondrial activity in brown adipose tissue even in the absence of β3-AR stimulation. Furthermore, -acetylcysteine increased the levels of peroxiredoxin 3 and superoxide dismutase 2 in adipose tissue, indicating increased mitochondrial oxidative stress. We interpret this negative impact of antioxidants on oxygen consumption  and adipose tissue   as essential adaptations that prevent a further increase in mitochondrial ROS production. In summary, these results suggest that chronic antioxidant supplementation can produce a paradoxical increase in oxidative stress associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in adipocytes.© 2019 Peris et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611815>Acute Aerobic Exercise Leads to Increased Plasma Levels of R- and S-β-Aminoisobutyric  in Humans.</a></h2><p>Recently, it was suggested that β-aminoisobutyric  (BAIBA) is a myokine involved in  of fat. However, there is no evidence for an acute effect of exercise supporting this statement and the metabolic distinct enantiomers of BAIBA were not taken into account. Concerning these enantiomers, there is at this point no consensus about resting concentrations of plasma R- and S-BAIBA. Additionally, a polymorphism of the alanine - glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 (AGXT2) gene (rs37369) is known to have a high impact on baseline levels of total BAIBA, but the effect on the enantiomers is unknown. Fifteen healthy recreationally active subjects, with different genotypes of rs37369, participated in a randomized crossover trial where they exercised for 1 h at 40% of P or remained at rest. Plasma samples were analyzed for R- and S-BAIBA using dual column HPLC-fluorescence. The plasma concentration of baseline R-BAIBA was 67 times higher compared to S-BAIBA (1734 ± 821 vs. 29.3 ± 7.8 nM). Exercise induced a 13 and 20% increase in R-BAIBA and S-BAIBA, respectively. The AGXT2 rs37369 genotype strongly affected baseline levels of R-BAIBA, but did not have an impact on baseline S-BAIBA. We demonstrate that BAIBA should not be treated as one molecule, given (1) the markedly uneven distribution of its enantiomers in human plasma favoring R-BAIBA, and (2) their different metabolic source, as evidenced by the AGXT2 polymorphism only affecting R-BAIBA. The proposed function in organ cross talk is supported by the current data and may apply to both enantiomers, but the tissue of origin remains unclear.Copyright © 2019 Stautemas, Van Kuilenburg, Stroomer, Vaz, Blancquaert, Lefevere, Everaert and Derave.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670192>The effect of amino  on non-enzymatic  of glucosamine: Generation of butterscotch aromatic and bioactive health compounds without detectable levels of neo-formed alkylimidazoles.</a></h2><p>A mixture of glucosamine (GlcN, 15% w/v) and different amino  in 1:1 M ratio was incubated at 70 °C for 12 h.

Acquisition of brown-like features (browning) in perivascular white adipose tissue (PVAT) may protect against obesity/cardiovascular disease. Most browning studies are performed in rodents, but translation to humans would benefit from a closer animal model. Therefore, we studied the browning response of ferret thoracic aortic PVAT (tPVAT) to cold. We performed global transcriptome analysis of tPVAT of 3-month-old ferrets acclimatized 1 week to 22 or 4°C, and compared the results with those of inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Immunohistochemistry was used to visualize browning. Transcriptome data revealed a stronger cold exposure response of tPVAT, including increased expression of key brown/brite markers, compared to subcutaneous . This translated into a clear white-to-brown remodeling of tPVAT, with the appearance of multilocular highly UCP1-stained adipocytes. The pathway most affected by cold exposure in tPVAT was immune response, characterized by down-regulation of immune-related genes, with cardio protective implications. On the other hand, subcutaneous  responded to cold by increasing energy  based on increased expression of fatty  oxidation and tricarboxylic  cycle genes, concordant with lower inguinal adipose tissue weight in cold-exposed animals. Thus, ferret tPVAT responds to cold acclimation with a strong induction of browning and immunosuppression compared to subcutaneous . Our results present ferrets as an accessible translational animal model displaying functional responses relevant for obesity and cardiovascular disease prevention.Copyright © 2019 Reynés, van Schothorst, Keijer, Ceresi, Oliver and Palou.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31353553>Postharvest application of antibrowning chemicals modulates oxidative stress and delays pericarp  of controlled atmosphere stored litchi fruit.</a></h2><p>Litchi fruit were treated with methionine [(0.25%) MN] and cysteine [(025%) CN] alone or in combination, and kept under 1% O + 5% CO controlled atmosphere (CA) at 5 ± 1ºC for 28 days. Among different treatments, CN was most effective to inhibit , than MN and CN + MN under CA conditions. Application of 0.25% CN significantly delayed  index, reduced disease incidence, weight loss, malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, electrolyte leakage, hydrogen peroxide (H O ), superoxide anion (O  ) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) activities with higher contents of total anthocyanins under CA-storage.

Therefore, 0.25% CN pre-treatment could be considered a promising way for managing , and conserving litchi fruit quality under CA-storage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Litchi fruit are highly perishable due to rapid pericarp  having limited postharvest market potential. The  takes place due to enzymatic reactions and phenolic oxidation. However, it can be delayed by exogenous antibrowning treatments and suitable storage environment.

To accomplish that, rats were acclimated to cold (4°C for 7 days). Subsequently, interscapular and aortic brown adipose tissues (iBAT and aBAT, respectively), epididymal (Epid), and Sc Ing WAT were used for adipocyte isolation. In BAT adipocytes, cold acclimation increased UCP1 content and palmitate oxidation either in the absence or presence of oligomycin, whereas in Sc Ing adipocytes glucose and palmitate oxidation were not affected, although multilocular adipocytes were formed and UCP1 content increased upon cold acclimation in the WAT. Furthermore, isoproterenol-stimulated cold Sc Ing adipocytes exhibited significantly lower rates of palmitate oxidation than control cells when exposed to oligomycin. These findings provide evidence that, despite increasing UCP1 levels, cold acclimation essentially reduced mitochondrial uncoupling-mediated fat oxidation in Sc Ing adipocytes. Conversely, glycerol kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase levels, isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, as well as glycerol and palmitate incorporation into lipids significantly increased in these cells. Therefore, instead of UCP1-mediated mitochondrial uncoupling, cold acclimation increased the capacity of Sc Ing adipocytes to export fatty  and enhanced key components of the triacylglycerol resynthesis pathway in the Sc Ing WAT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474567>Tanycytes Regulate Lipid Homeostasis by Sensing Free Fatty  and Signaling to Key Hypothalamic Neuronal Populations via FGF21 Secretion.</a></h2><p>The hypothalamus plays a key role in the detection of energy substrates to regulate energy homeostasis. Tanycytes, the hypothalamic ependymo-glia, are located at a privileged position to integrate multiple peripheral inputs. We observed that tanycytes produce and secrete Fgf21 and are located close to Fgf21-sensitive neurons. Fasting, likely via the increase in circulating fatty , regulates this central Fgf21 production. Tanycytes store palmitate in lipid droplets and oxidize it, leading to the activation of a reactive oxygen species (ROS)/p38-MAPK signaling pathway, which is essential for tanycytic Fgf21 expression upon palmitate exposure. Tanycytic Fgf21 deletion triggers an increase in lipolysis, likely due to impaired inhibition of key neurons during fasting. Mice deleted for tanycytic Fgf21 exhibit increased energy expenditure and a reduction in fat mass gain, reminiscent of a  phenotype. Our results suggest that tanycytes sense free fatty  to maintain body lipid homeostasis through Fgf21 signaling within the hypothalamus.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Insects for food/feed uses are currently slowly killed through freezing by most insect rearing companies, and typically, enzymatic  takes place in the insect proteins fractions. However, very little is known about the influence of these enzymatic reactions on the protein physical, chemical, nutritional and technological properties. In this work a metabolomics and proteomic study was conducted on Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens) prepupae, killed by two different methods: freezing (commonly used), and blanching (with the aim to inhibit the enzymatic activities). Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H NMR) metabolomics demonstrated that slow killing method by freezing, compared with blanching, elicits the activation of several enzymatic pathways, among them melanisation with tyrosine consumption, energetic metabolism and lipolysis. These metabolic changes have an impact also on protein nutritional quality, with a loss of cysteine and lysine, likely involved in the process of melanisation and enzymatic . A strong effect was also observed on protein extractability: proteins from prepupae killed by blanching were found to be more extractable in milder conditions by chemical methods, and more prone to enzymatic digestion (97% of proteins released in solution upon proteolysis) than proteins from prepupae killed by freezing. All these data indicate that killing by blanching inhibits the  reaction and other enzymatic changes occurring during slow killing by freezing, increasing the extractability of proteins in aqueous solutions, avoiding essential amino  loss, and improving enzymatic digestibility.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of maqui on the onset and development of the obese phenotype and insulin resistance was investigated in high fat diet-induced obese mice supplemented with a lyophilized maqui berry. Maqui-dietary supplemented animals showed better insulin response and decreased weight gain but also a differential expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis, fatty  oxidation, multilocular lipid droplet formation and thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT).

Inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) can undergo robust brown remodeling with appropriate stimuli and is therefore widely considered as a representative beige fat depot. However, adipose tissues residing in different anatomic depots exhibit a broad range of plasticity, raising the possibility that better beige fat depots with greater plasticity may exist. Here we identified and characterized a novel, naturally-existing beige fat depot, thigh adipose tissue (tAT). Unlike classic WATs, tAT maintains beige fat morphology at room temperature, whereas high-fat diet (HFD) feeding or aging promotes the development of typical WAT features, namely unilocular adipocytes. The brown adipocyte gene expression in tAT is consistently higher than in iWAT under cold exposure, HFD feeding, and rosiglitazone treatment conditions. Our molecular profiling by RNA-Seq revealed up-regulation of energy expenditure pathways and repressed inflammation in tAT relative to eWAT and iWAT. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the master fatty  oxidation regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α is dispensable for maintaining and activating the beige character of tAT. Therefore, we have identified tAT as a natural beige adipose depot in mice with a unique molecular profile that does not require peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α.© 2019 Chan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797341>Effect of infrared roasting on antioxidant activity, phenolic composition and Maillard reaction products of Tartary buckwheat varieties.</a></h2><p>The effect of infrared roasting (130, 150 and 170 °C for 10 min) on antioxidant activity, total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), Maillard reaction products (MRP) and phenolic profile in eight Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) varieties were investigated.

A. pullulans applied before final frying changes the free amino  composition of potatoes, decreasing the content of free asparagine by 16% and reducing acrylamide by 83% in fried potatoes. Potato  was also reduced by yeast treatment without negative drawbacks on chip taste. This yeast, commonly used in fruit postharvest disease control, can therefore also be applied in potato and bakery industries to reduce food acrylamide content.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We characterized the phytochemical profile of extracts from coffee husk, coffee silverskin, and cocoa shell and evaluated their in vitro biological activity in RAW264.7 macrophages and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Pearson correlations and principal component regressions were performed to find the contribution of phytochemicals and underlying mechanisms of action. Coffee husk and silverskin extracts were mainly composed of caffeine and chlorogenic . Major components in cocoa shell included theobromine and protocatechuic . Both coffee and cocoa by-product extracts effectively reduced inflammatory markers in macrophages and adipocytes (NO, PGE, TNF-α, MCP-1, and IL-6) and the production of reactive oxygen species (21.5-66.4%). Protocatechuic and chlorogenic , together with caffeine, were suggested as main contributors against inflammation and oxidative stress. Furthermore, extracts reduced lipid accumulation (4.1-49.1%) in adipocytes by regulating lipolysis and inducing adipocyte . Gallic and chlorogenic  were associated with reduced adipogenesis, and caffeine with adipocyte . Extracts from coffee and cocoa by-products also modulated the phosphorylation of insulin receptor signaling pathway and stimulated GLUT-4 translocation (52.4-72.9%), increasing glucose uptake. The insulin-sensitizing potential of the extracts was mainly associated with protocatechuic . For the first time, we identified the phytochemicals from coffee and cocoa by-products and offered new insights into their associations with biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, adipogenesis, and insulin resistance in vitro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30415846>Lactobacillus casei expressing methylglyoxal synthase causes  and heterocyclic amine formation in Parmesan cheese extract.</a></h2><p>Undesired  of Parmesan cheese can occur during the latter period of ripening and cold storage despite the relative absence of reducing sugars and high temperatures typically associated with Maillard . Highly reactive α-dicarbonyls such as methylglyoxal (MG) are products and accelerants of Maillard  chemistry and can result from the microbial metabolism of sugars and AA by lactic  bacteria. We demonstrate the effects of microbially produced MG in a model Parmesan cheese extract using a strain of Lactobacillus casei 12A engineered for inducible overexpression of MG synthase (mgsA) from Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum HG-8. Maximum induction of plasmid-born mgsA led to 1.6 mM MG formation in Parmesan cheese extract and its distinct discoloration. The accumulation of heterocyclic amines including β-carboline derivatives arising from mgsA expression were determined by mass spectrometry. Potential MG-contributing reaction mechanisms for the formation of heterocyclic amines are proposed. These findings implicate nonstarter lactic  bacteria may cause  and influence nutritional aspects of Parmesan by enzymatic conversion of triosephosphates to MG. Moreover, these findings indicate that the microbial production of MG can lead to the formation of late-stage Maillard reaction products such as melanoidin and β-carbolines, effectively circumventing the thermal requirement of the early- and intermediate- stage Maillard reaction. Therefore, the identification and control of offending microbiota may prevent late-stage  of Parmesan. The gene mgsA may serve as a genetic biomarker for cheeses with a propensity to undergo MG-mediated .Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The selected proteases were able to inactivate PPO at pH 4.5, with the degree of inactivation proportional to incubation time and protease concentration. Papain was the most effective protease, with 50 μg completely inactivating PPO in less than one hour. AA prevented  reactions that occur before or during PPO inactivation by protease. The combinations of AA/proteases were highly effective  where 2 mM AA/500 μg proteases inhibited PPO activity completely over 24 h. The combination of AA/proteases was also effective , as treated apricot purees preserved their color ( < 0.0001, compared to untreated samples after 10 days of storage). The results demonstrate that AA/proteases combinations constitute a promising practical anti- method with feasible application in the food industry.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31339170>Myricanol modulates skeletal muscle-adipose tissue crosstalk to alleviate high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Skeletal muscle is the predominant site for glucose disposal and fatty  consumption. Emerging evidence indicates that the crosstalk between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle is critical in maintaining insulin sensitivity and lipid homeostasis. The current study was designed to investigate whether myricanol improves insulin sensitivity and alleviates adiposity through modulating skeletal muscle-adipose tissue crosstalk.The therapeutic effect of myricanol was evaluated on palmitic  (PA)-treated C2C12 myotubes and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. The crosstalk between myotubes and adipocytes was evaluated using Transwell assay. The cellular lipid content was examined by Nile red staining. The mitochondrial content was assessed by MitoTracker Green staining and citrate synthase activity, and the mitochondrial function was examined by Seahorse assay. Expression of mitochondria-related and insulin signalling pathway proteins was analysed by Western blot, and the irisin level was determined by elisa kit.Myricanol increased mitochondrial quantity and function through activating AMP-activated protein kinase, resulting in reduced lipid accumulation and enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, in PA-treated C2C12 myotubes. Furthermore, myricanol stimulated irisin production and secretion from myotubes to reduce lipid content in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In HFD-fed mice, myricanol treatment alleviated adiposity and insulin resistance through enhancing lipid utilization and irisin production in skeletal muscle and inducing  of inguinal fat.Myricanol modulates skeletal muscle-adipose tissue crosstalk, to stimulate  of adipose tissue and improve insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. Myricanol might be a potential candidate for treating insulin resistance and obesity.© 2019 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31119557>Effects of ascorbic  on patulin in aqueous solution and in cloudy apple juice.</a></h2><p>Degradation of the mycotoxin patulin (PAT) and the generation of (less toxic) breakdown products, such as (E/Z)-ascladiol (ASC-E/Z) and desoxypatulinic  (D-PAT), can occur due to chemical, physical and biological treatments. Our study focused on the chemical degradation of PAT in the presence of ascorbic  (AA) both for pure PAT standard in acidified aqueous solution and for PAT-contaminated cloudy apple juice (CAJ) (obtained via addition of apple mash produced from apples inoculated with Penicillium expansum). Within this framework, different concentrations of AA were evaluated, as well as the presence/absence of oxygen and different storage temperatures. In order to do so, an in-house methodology allowing a good separation of PAT from its reaction and breakdown products was optimized first. The highest PAT reduction (60%) in CAJ with an initial PAT concentration of 100 μg/kg and 0.25% (w/v) AA was achieved after 6 days of incubation at 22 °C in the presence of oxygen. It was also found that the treatment by AA resulted in the generation of degradation products less toxic than PAT (such as (E/Z)-ASC). In conclusion, AA used to improve numerous product quality aspects (e.g. colour (less ), nutritional value, etc.) and considered as a safe food additive (Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (1999)) has an effect on PAT degradation. It was shown that such degradation generated less toxic compounds in the presence of oxygen. In view of consumers' safety, fortification of apple juice (and possibly apple-based products) with AA could be helpful within an integrated system to ensure products with low levels of patulin. The optimum conditions for such an approach within a legal and practical point of view need to be further explored.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31247444>Exogenous proline has favorable effects on growth and  suppression in rice but not in tobacco.</a></h2><p>Proline is one of the amino  that compose proteins and has various roles under non-stress and stress conditions. In this study, we investigated the effect of proline on the growth and  of two plants, tobacco and rice, by exogenous application and endogenous increase of proline. Exogenous proline had a different effect on the growth and  between tobacco and rice: proline affected negatively the growth of tobacco seedlings and favorably that of rice seedlings. In addition, proline prevented  only in rice cultured cells, consistent with the increase of proline contents, but not in tobacco BY-2 cells. These results might be due to the difference of exogenous proline uptake activity in these cells. From the Lineweaver-Burk plots, proline inhibited polyphenol oxidase activity in vitro, which is a major factor of enzymatic  in plants, by affecting the enzyme-substrate complex. Proline could suppress the  of the plant callus by inhibition of PPO activity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Using a pilot-scale PEF system, MH juice, pre-heated at 55 °C, was PEF-treated at 19 kV/cm of electric field and 170 kJ/L of specific energy and the juice, pre-heated at 70 °C, was PEF-treated at 16 kV/cm and 100 kJ/L or 12 kV/cm and 150 kJ/L. H-PEF processing at 70 °C-16 kV/cm-100 kJ/L reduced the aerobe, yeast/mold, and coliform counts of MH juice by 3.9, 4.3, and 0.8 log CFU/mL, respectively, without affecting the ascorbic  concentration and antioxidant capacity of juice. H-PEF processing changed juice color and  degree ( < 0.05), but not total soluble solid content or pH. By controlling initial juice temperature and electric field strength, H-PEF processing can be an effective pasteurization method for mixed juice with minimal changes in quality.</p></html>
