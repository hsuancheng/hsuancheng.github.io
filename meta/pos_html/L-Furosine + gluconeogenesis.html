However, there have not been any reports concerning its anti-diabetic potential until now. Therefore, we evaluated the anti-diabetic potential of didymin via inhibition of α-glucosidase, protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), rat lens aldose reductase (RLAR), human recombinant AR (HRAR), and advanced glycation end-product (AGE) formation inhibitory assays. Didymin strongly inhibited PTP1B, α-glucosidase, HRAR, RLAR, and AGE in the corresponding assays. Kinetic study revealed that didymin exhibited a mixed type inhibition against α-glucosidase and HRAR, while it competitively inhibited PTP1B and RLAR. Docking simulations of didymin demonstrated negative binding energies and close proximity to residues in the binding pocket of HRAR, RLAR, PTP1B and α-glucosidase, indicating that didymin have high affinity and tight binding capacity towards the active site of these enzymes. Furthermore, we also examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-diabetic effects of didymin in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells which significantly increased glucose uptake and decreased the expression of PTP1B in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. In addition, didymin activated insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 by increasing phosphorylation at  895 and enhanced the phosphorylations of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and glycogen synthasekinase-3(GSK-3). Interestingly, didymin reduced the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase, two key enzymes involved in the  and leading to a diminished glucose production. The results of the present study clearly demonstrated that didymin will be useful for developing multiple target-oriented therapeutic modalities for treatment of diabetes, and diabetes-associated complications.© 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11390373>Dual action of eicosapentaenoic acid in hepatoma cells: up-regulation of metabolic action of insulin and inhibition of cell proliferation.</a></h2><p>Exogenous administration of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves insulin sensitivity, but its precise mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that EPA stimulates the intracellular insulin signaling pathway in hepatoma cells. Exposure of these cells to EPA caused up-regulation of several insulin-induced activities including  phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, insulin receptor substrate-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and its downstream target Akt kinase activity as well as down-regulation of . In contrast, EPA decreased mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and inhibited cell proliferation.

We detected two major signalling pathways (ion channels and the ERBB signalling family of  kinases) that could be replicated across independent GWA studies meta-analyses. To investigate the significance of these pathways for sleep modulation, we performed transcriptome analyses of short sleeping flies' heads (knockdown for the ABCC9 gene homolog; dSur). We found significant alterations in gene-expression in the short sleeping knockdowns versus controls flies, which correspond to pathways associated with sleep duration in our human studies. Most notably, the expression of Rho and EGFR (members of the ERBB signalling pathway) genes was down- and up-regulated, respectively, consistently with the established role of these genes for sleep consolidation in Drosophila. Using a disease multifactorial interaction network, we showed that many of the genes of the pathways indicated to be relevant for sleep duration had functional evidence of their involvement with sleep regulation, circadian rhythms, insulin secretion,  and lipogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26655661>Metabolomics reveals energetic impairments in Daphnia magna exposed to diazinon, malathion and bisphenol-A.</a></h2><p>(1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics was used to study the response of Daphnia magna to increasing sub-lethal concentrations of either an organophosphate (diazinon or malathion) or bisphenol-A (BPA). Principal component analysis (PCA) of (1)H NMR spectra were used to screen metabolome changes after 48h of contaminant exposure. The PCA scores plots showed that diazinon exposures resulted in aberrant metabolomic profiles at all exposure concentrations tested (0.009-0.135 μg/L), while for malathion the second lowest (0.08μg/L) and two highest exposure concentrations (0.32μg/L and 0.47μg/L) caused significant shifts from the control. Individual metabolite changes for both organophosphates indicated that the response to increasing exposure was non-linear and described perturbations in the metabolome that were characteristic of the severity of exposure. For example, intermediate concentrations of diazinon (0.045μg/L and 0.09μg/L) and malathion (0.08μg/L) elicited a decrease in amino acids such as leucine, valine, arginine, glycine, lysine, glutamate, glutamine, phenylalanine and , with concurrent increases in glucose and lactate, suggesting a mobilization of energy resources to combat stress. At the highest exposure concentrations for both organophosphates there was evidence of a cessation in metabolic activity, where the same amino acids increased and glucose and lactate decreased, suggesting a slowdown in protein synthesis and depletion of energy stocks. This demonstrated a similar response in the metabolome between two organophosphates but also that intermediate and severe stress levels could be differentiated by changes in the metabolome. For BPA exposures, the PCA scores plot showed a significant change in metabolome at 0.1mg/L, 1.4mg/L and 2.1mg/L of exposure. Individual metabolite changes from 0.7 to 2.1mg/L of BPA exposure showed increases in amino acids such as alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, arginine, phenylalanine and . These metabolite changes were correlated with decreases in glucose and lactate. This pattern of response was also seen in the highest organophosphate exposures and suggested a generalized stress response that could be related to altered energy dynamics in D. magna. Through studying increasing exposure responses, we have demonstrated the ability of metabolomics to identify discrete differences between intermediate and severe stress, and also to characterize how systemic stress is manifested in the metabolome.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Considering that  production is gradually shifting to microbial production method, its production from acetate can be attempted to further improve the economic feasibility of its production.Here, we engineered a previously reported strain, SCK1, for efficient production of  from acetate. Initially, the acetate uptake and gluconeogenic pathway were amplified to maximize the flux toward . As flux distribution between glyoxylate and TCA cycles is critical for efficient precursor supplementation, the activity of the glyoxylate cycle was precisely controlled by expression of isocitrate lyase gene under different-strength promoters. Consequently, the engineered strain with optimal flux distribution produced 0.70 g/ with 20% of the theoretical maximum yield which are 1.6-fold and 1.9-fold increased values of the parental strain. production from acetate requires precise tuning of the glyoxylate cycle and we obtained substantial improvements in production titer and yield by synthetic promoters and 5' untranslated regions (UTRs). This is the first demonstration of  production from acetate. Our strategies would be widely applicable to the production of various chemicals from acetate in future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26674644>RUNX1-Evi-1 fusion gene inhibited differentiation and apoptosis in myelopoiesis: an in vivo study.</a></h2><p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 1-Evi-1 is a chimeric gene generated by the t (3; 21) (q26; q22) translocation, which leads into malignant transformation of hematopoietic stem cells by unclear mechanisms. This in vivo study aimed to establish a stable line of zebrafish expressing the human RUNX1-Evi-1 fusion gene under the control of a heat stress-inducible bidirectional promoter, and investigate its roles in hematopoiesis and hematologic malignancies.We introduced human RUNX1-Evi-1 fusion gene into embryonic zebrafish through a heat-shock promoter to establish Tg(RE:HSE:EGFP) zebrafish. Two males and one female mosaic F0 zebrafish embryos (2.1%) were identified as stable positive germline transgenic zebrafish.The population of immature myeloid cells and hematopoietic blast cells were accumulated in peripheral blood and single cell suspension from kidney of adult Tg(RE:HSE:EGFP) zebrafish. RUNX1-Evi-1 presented an intensive influence on hematopoietic regulatory factors. Consequently, primitive hematopoiesis was enhanced by upregulation of gata2 and scl, while erythropoiesis was downregulated due to the suppression of gata1. Early stage of myelopoiesis was flourishing with the high expression of pu.1, but it was inhibited along with the low expression of mpo. Microarray analysis demonstrated that RUNX1-Evi-1 not only upregulated proteasome, cell cycle, /gluconeogenesis,  metabolism, drug metabolism, and PPAR pathway, but also suppressed transforming growth factor β, Jak-STAT, DNA replication, mismatch repair, p53 pathway, JNK signaling pathway, and nucleotide excision repair. Interestingly, histone deacetylase 4 was significantly up-regulated. Factors in cell proliferation were obviously suppressed after 3-day treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitor, valproic acid. Accordingly, higher proportion of G1 arrest and apoptosis were manifested by the propidium iodide staining.RUNX1-Evi-1 may promote proliferation and apoptosis resistance of primitive hematopoietic cell, and inhibit the differentiation of myeloid cells with the synergy of different pathways and factors. VPA may be a promising choice in the molecular targeting therapy of RUNX1-Evi-1-related leukemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27076444>The Regulation of Fatty Acid Oxidation in Human Preeclampsia.</a></h2><p>Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy disorder characterized by high blood pressure, placental oxidative stress, and proteinuria. In a GeneFishing experiment using human preeclamptic placenta, expression of acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase very long chain (ACADVL), which is involved in fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO), was detected. To investigate the correlation between PE and FAO, this study subjected in vitro BeWo cells and in vivo pregnant mice to oxidative stress induced by hypoxia. Hypoxic condition, which oxygen supply is insufficient in cells and placenta, created a similar state to placental oxidative stress in PE, as evidenced by increased hypoxic (oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1, hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha subunit) and preeclamptic markers (soluble fms-like  kinase 1) both in vitro and in vivo. Increased expression of FAO-related genes (ACADVL, enoyl-coenzyme A hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase) was observed in these models as well as in cases of preeclamptic preterm labor. In the in vivo liver model, messenger RNA expression of gluconeogenesis-related genes increased. Consequently, these results suggest that expression of FAO-related genes is regulated by hypoxic conditions and onset time of PE and affects maternal gluconeogenesis during pregnancy in patients with PE.© The Author(s) 2016.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2894228>[Autogenic regulation of the sensitivity of liver cells to glucocorticoids during prolonged hormonal stimulation].</a></h2><p>The mechanisms of reversible decrease of hormone-dependent induction of  aminotransferase (TAT) by rat liver cells after prolonged administration of the glucocorticoid was studied. It was shown that the main links of the glucocorticoid action mechanism (i.e., the formation of a cytoplasmic hormone-receptor complex and the hormone accumulation in the nuclei) do not change under these conditions. It was found also that one of the necessary prerequisites for the decrease of the hormone-dependent induction of TAT is the constant production by liver cells of large amounts of TAT irrespective of whether this process is induced by the glucocorticoid or by a non-hormonal inducer, e.g., tryptophan. Using the dot-hybridization technique, it was demonstrated that the inhibition of hormone-dependent induction of TAT is correlated with the reduction of mRNA TAT. It was supposed that the main links in the mechanism of inhibition of the hormone-dependent induction are the formation of a large excess of the inducible protein--TAT--in the cells as well as the accumulation of end products of the TAT-catalyzed transamination reaction which cause a feed-back repression of the de novo synthesis of TAT. Studies with cell cultures of Morris hepatoma which is known to be sensitive to glucocorticoids revealed the ability of glucose, the end product of  reactions, to provide for selective inhibition of the hormone-induced accumulation of mRNA TAT in hepatoma cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9395482>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) gene transcription and hyperglycemia are regulated by glucocorticoids in genetically obese db/db transgenic mice.</a></h2><p>The molecular mechanisms underlying increased hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene transcription and  in type II diabetes are largely unknown. To examine the involvement of glucocorticoids and the cis-acting insulin response sequence (IRS, -416/-407) in the genetically obese db/db mouse model, we generated crosses between C57BL/KsJ-db/+ mice and transgenic mice that express -460 or -2000 base pairs of the rat PEPCK gene promoter containing an intact or mutated IRS, linked to a reporter gene. Transgenic mice expressing the intact PEPCK(460)-CRP (C-reactive protein) transgene bred to near homozygosity at the db locus were obese, hyperinsulinemic, and developed fasting hyperglycemia (389 +/- 26 mg/100 ml) between 4 and 10 weeks of age. Levels of CRP reporter gene expression were increased 2-fold despite severe hyperinsulinemia compared with non-diabetic non-obese transgenic mice. Reporter gene expression was also increased 2-fold in transgenic obese diabetic db/db mice bearing a mutation in the IRS, -2000(IRS)-hGx, compared with non-obese non-diabetic transgenic 2000(IRS)-hGx mice. Treatment of obese diabetic db/db transgenic mice with the glucocorticoid receptor blocker RU 486 decreased plasma glucose by 50% and reduced PEPCK, GLUT2, glucose-6-phosphatase,  aminotransferase, CRP, and hGx reporter gene expression to levels similar to those of non-obese normoglycemic transgenic mice. Taken together, these results establish that -460 bp of 5'-flanking sequence is sufficient to mediate the induction of PEPCK gene transcription in genetically obese db/db mice during the development of hyperglycemia. The results further demonstrate that the mechanism underlying increased expression of gluconeogenic enzymes in the db/db mouse requires the action of glucocorticoids and occurs independently of factors acting through the PEPCK IRS (-416/-407) promoter binding site.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25808216>Resveratrol treatment restores peripheral insulin sensitivity in diabetic mice in a sirt1-independent manner.</a></h2><p>Mice with deletion of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 2 develop hyperglycaemia, impaired hepatic insulin signaling and elevated . Protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibition by resveratrol improves peripheral insulin sensitivity of these mice. Although resveratrol activates Sirtuin1 (Sirt1), the mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects are not totally elucidated. In this study, we have investigated whether Sirt1 mediates the effects of resveratrol in controlling insulin resistance in diabetic mice.We attempted to ameliorate peripheral insulin resistance in two diabetic models, Irs2-deficient (Irs2(-/-)) mice and streptozotocin (STZ)-injected mice by resveratrol treatment or Sirt1 overexpression. Resveratrol improved systemic insulin sensitivity of Irs2-deficient mice. Irs2-deficient mice are characterized by high levels of PTP1B expression in liver and muscle. Interestingly, resveratrol decreased PTP1B in both tissues, thereby restoring IRS1-mediated insulin signaling. Moreover, resveratrol also restored insulin sensitivity and hepatic insulin signaling in STZ-diabetic mice. In contrast, moderate overexpression of Sirt1 neither normalized PTP1B levels nor restored insulin signaling in Irs2-deficient mice or STZ-diabetic mice.Resveratrol improves peripheral insulin signaling independently of Sirt1 in diabetic mice in association with the inhibition of PTP1B and, therefore, this polyphenol could be an effective adjuvant for the treatment of diabetes.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate is a necessary cofactor for the reductase activity of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (EC 1.1.1.146), which converts hormonally inactive cortisone to active cortisol (in rodents, 11-dehydrocorticosterone to corticosterone). Mice with targeted inactivation of hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase lack 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 reductase activity, whereas dehydrogenase activity (corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone) is increased. We now report that both glucose output and glucose use are abnormal in these mice. Mutant mice have fasting hypoglycemia. In mutant primary hepatocytes, glucose output does not increase normally in response to glucagon. Mutant animals have lower hepatic glycogen content when fed and cannot mobilize it normally when fasting. As assessed by RT-PCR, responses of hepatic enzymes to fasting are blunted; enzymes involved in  (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase,  aminotransferase) are not appropriately up-regulated, and expression of glucokinase, an enzyme required for glycolysis, is not suppressed. Corticosterone has attenuated effects on expression of these enzymes in cultured mutant primary hepatocytes. Mutant mice have increased sensitivity to insulin, as assessed by homeostatic model assessment values and by increased glucose uptake by the muscle. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is also abnormal. Circulating ACTH, deoxycorticosterone, and corticosterone levels are increased in mutant animals, suggesting decreased negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Comparison with other animal models of adrenal insufficiency suggests that many of the observed abnormalities can be explained by blunted intracellular corticosterone actions, despite elevated circulating levels of this hormone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11724768>Ghrelin modulates the downstream molecules of insulin signaling in hepatoma cells.</a></h2><p>Ghrelin was identified in the stomach as an endogenous ligand specific for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R). GHS-R is found in various tissues, but its function is unknown. Here we show that GHS-R is found in hepatoma cells. Exposure of these cells to ghrelin caused up-regulation of several insulin-induced activities including  phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), association of the adapter molecule growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 with IRS-1, mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, and cell proliferation. Unlike insulin, ghrelin inhibited Akt kinase activity as well as up-regulated .

As: (i) in addition to liver, kidney is an important source of glucose in mammals and (ii) the action of this drug on renal  has not yet been studied, the aim of the present investigation was to estimate the influence of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine metabolism on glucose formation in isolated kidney-cortex tubules incubated with various gluconeogenic substrates. The data indicate that a rapid intracellular degradation of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and tyramine (at 100 and 200 microM concentrations) is accompanied by 25-40% decrease in glucose production from pyruvate, alanine + glycerol + octanoate and dihydroxyacetone due to augmented generation of hydrogen peroxide via monoamine oxidase B, resulting in a decline of glutathione redox state by 40%. Moreover, following inhibition of monoamine oxidase B by deprenyl or substitution of pyruvate by aspartate + glycerol + octanoate both L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and tyramine affect neither the rate of  nor glutathione redox state. In view of: (i) L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine- and tyramine-induced changes in intracellular levels of gluconeogenic intermediates, and (ii) a significant decline of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity by 500 microM oxidized glutathione, it is likely that L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine- and tyramine-evoked disturbances in the glutathione redox state might diminish flux through phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and in consequence decrease glucose formation in renal tubules, suggesting a new potential side-action of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3032541>Mechanisms of hormonal regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism.</a></h2><p>Acute hormonal regulation of liver carbohydrate metabolism mainly involves changes in the cytosolic levels of cAMP and Ca2+. Epinephrine, acting through beta 2-adrenergic receptors, and glucagon activate adenylate cyclase in the liver plasma membrane through a mechanism involving a guanine nucleotide-binding protein that is stimulatory to the enzyme. The resulting accumulation of cAMP leads to activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which, in turn, phosphorylates many intracellular enzymes involved in the regulation of glycogen metabolism, , and glycolysis. These are (1) phosphorylase b kinase, which is activated and, in turn, phosphorylates and activates phosphorylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for glycogen breakdown; (2) glycogen synthase, which is inactivated and is rate-controlling for glycogen synthesis; (3) pyruvate kinase, which is inactivated and is an important regulatory enzyme for glycolysis; and (4) the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase bifunctional enzyme, phosphorylation of which leads to decreased formation of fructose 2,6-P2, which is an activator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase and an inhibitor of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, both of which are important regulatory enzymes for glycolysis and . In addition to rapid effects of glucagon and beta-adrenergic agonists to increase hepatic glucose output by stimulating glycogenolysis and  and inhibiting glycogen synthesis and glycolysis, these agents produce longer-term stimulatory effects on  through altered synthesis of certain enzymes of /glycolysis and amino acid metabolism. For example, P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase is induced through an effect at the level of transcription mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase.  amino-transferase, serine dehydratase, tryptophan oxygenase, and glucokinase are also regulated by cAMP, in part at the level of specific messenger RNA synthesis. The sympathetic nervous system and its neurohumoral agonists epinephrine and norepinephrine also rapidly alter hepatic glycogen metabolism and  acting through alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. The primary response to these agonists is the phosphodiesterase-mediated breakdown of the plasma membrane polyphosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol 4,5-P2 to inositol 1,4,5-P3 and 1,2-diacylglycerol. This involves a guanine nucleotide-binding protein that is different from those involved in the regulation of adenylate cyclase. Inositol 1,4,5-P3 acts as an intracellular messenger for Ca2+ mobilization by releasing Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3689172>In vitro maintenance of terminal-differentiated state in hepatocytes entrapped within calcium alginate.</a></h2><p>In cultured hepatocytes entrapped within Ca-alginate, liver-specific functions such as induction of  aminotransferase and serine dehydratase were stimulated by increasing the cell density.

Extensive studies about the effects of Cd on human health have been reported, however, a systematic investigation on the molecular mechanisms of the effects of Cd on central nervous system is still needed. In this paper, the neuronal PC-12 cells were treated with a series of concentrations of CdCl for 48h. Then the cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The IC value (15% inhibiting concentration) was selected for further mechanism studies. After PC-12 cells incubated with CdCl at a dose of IC for 48h, the intracellular and extracellular metabolites were profiled using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS)-based cell metabolomics approach. As found, the effects of the heavy metal Cd produced on the PC-12 cell viability were dose-dependent. The metabolic changes were involved in the glycolysis and , biopterin metabolism, tryptophan metabolism,  metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and fatty acids beta-oxidation. These could cause the perturbation of cell membrane, redox balance, energy supply, cellular detoxification, further affecting the cellular proliferation and apoptosis and other cellular activities.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This regulation is mediated via a cAMP-response element (CRE). This report addresses the role of cAMP in the physiological activation of a subset of liver-specific genes which are perinatally activated. The  aminotransferase (TAT) gene and other genes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxyquinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase, involved in , belong to this category. CRE elements derived from the rat TAT-3.6 kb enhancer have been positioned in chimeric constructs, such that the activity of the reporter gene LacZ is dependent on cAMP. The tissue-specificity of these constructs is guaranteed by the presence of the liver-specific enhancers of the alpha fetoprotein gene. These constructs have been tested in cells and transgenic mice demonstrating cAMP regulation, liver-specific expression and perinatal activation of the reporter gene. The CRE is recognized by a number of related proteins of which the cAMP-response element-binding factor (CREB) has been best studied. To assess the role of CREB in the in vivo transduction of cAMP signalling, mice deficient in CREB protein have been generated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Homozygous mutant mice, although recovering at a lower ratio than expected, do not display impairment of growth or development.

During glucagon deficiency, produced by intravenous infusion of somatostatin (0.5 mg/h) and insulin (5 mU/kg per h), amino acid concentration (sum of 21 amino acids) rose from 2,607 +/- 76 to 2,922 +/- 133 microM after 4 h (P less than 0.025). The largest increases occurred in lysine (+26%), glycine (+24%), alanine (+23%), and arginine (+23%) concentrations. During glucagon excess produced by intravenous infusion of somatostatin (0.5 mg/h), insulin (5 mU/kg per h), and glucagon (60 ng/kg per h), amino acid concentration decreased from 2,774 +/- 166 to 2,388 +/- 102 microM at 8 h (P less than 0.01). The largest decreases occurred in citrulline (-37%), proline (-32%), ornithine (-30%),  (-23%), glycine (-20%), threonine (-21%), and alanine (18%) concentrations. Urinary urea nitrogen and total nitrogen excretions were lower during glucagon deficiency than during glucagon excess (3.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 6.3 +/- 2.3 g/8 h, P less than 0.05 and 4.8 +/- 1.0 vs 7.0 +/- 2.6 g/8 h, respectively, P less than 0.05).

Amino acid concentration (sum of 18 amino acids) increases occurred in arginine (+42%), alanine (+28%), glutamine (+25%), and glycine (+16%) concentrations. The data show that small changes (-66 pg/ml and +50 pg/ml) in basal glucagon concentrations cause plasma amino acid concentrations to change in opposite directions. The finding that urinary excretion of nitrogen and urea nitrogen was greater during glucagon excess than during glucagon deficiency suggested alterations in the rate of  from amino acids as one mechanism by which glucagon controls blood amino acid levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21744875>Metabolic signatures of lung cancer in biofluids: NMR-based metabonomics of blood plasma.</a></h2><p>In this work, the variations in the metabolic profile of blood plasma from lung cancer patients and healthy controls were investigated through NMR-based metabonomics, to assess the potential of this approach for lung cancer screening and diagnosis. PLS-DA modeling of CPMG spectra from plasma, subjected to Monte Carlo Cross Validation, allowed cancer patients to be discriminated from controls with sensitivity and specificity levels of about 90%. Relatively lower HDL and higher VLDL + LDL in the patients' plasma, together with increased lactate and pyruvate and decreased levels of glucose, citrate, formate, acetate, several amino acids (alanine, glutamine, histidine, , valine), and methanol, could be detected. These changes were found to be present at initial disease stages and could be related to known cancer biochemical hallmarks, such as enhanced glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and , together with suppressed Krebs cycle and reduced lipid catabolism, thus supporting the hypothesis of a systemic metabolic signature for lung cancer. Despite the possible confounding influence of age, smoking habits, and other uncontrolled factors, these results indicate that NMR-based metabonomics of blood plasma can be useful as a screening tool to identify suspicious cases for subsequent, more specific radiological tests, thus contributing to improved disease management.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29624009>The concentration of free amino acids in blood serum of dairy cows with primary ketosis.</a></h2><p>Ketosis is a common condition found in the initial stages of lactation in high-yielding dairy cows. The major cause of ketosis is a negative energy balance. During the energy deficiency, proteolysis processes develop parallel to lipolysis. During proteolysis, muscle tissue can be used as a source of amino acid. To date, the participation of amino acids in  (glucogenic amino acids) and ketogenesis (ketogenic amino acids) has not been determined in detail. This paper presents the study on determination of the parameters of protein and free amino acid metabolism in blood serum of dairy cows with primary ketosis compared to healthy cows. This study contributes to better understanding of the role of amino acids in pathogenesis of ketosis. A total of 30 cows, divided into two groups: experimental (15 cows with ketosis) and control (15 healthy cows), were included in the study. The concentrations of glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate, total protein, albumin, urea, and free amino acids were determined in peripheral blood. Statistically significantly higher concentrations of glutamine, glutamic acid, isoleucine (p≤0.001), and  (p≤0.05) were found in cows with primary ketosis compared to healthy cows. Significant decrease in the concentrations of asparagine, histidine, methionine, and serine (p≤0.001), alanine, leucine, lysine and proline (p≤0.05) was observed. Significant increase of total ketogenic and glucogenic amino acids (p≤0.05), and an increased ratio of total ketogenic and glucogenic amino acids to total amino acids (p≤0.001) were noted in cows with ketosis. In our study, the changes, in particular observed in amino acid concentration in cows with primary ketosis, indicate its intensive use in both ketogenesis and  processes. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the role that amino acids play in  and ketogenesis will improve ketosis diagnostics and monitoring the course of a ketosis episode. Perhaps, the prevention of this disease is possible by balancing the appropriate feed ration in terms of amino acid content.Copyright© by the Polish Academy of Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535578>Suhuai suckling piglet hindgut microbiome-metabolome responses to different dietary copper levels.</a></h2><p>Unabsorbed copper accumulates in the hindgut of pigs that consume high levels of dietary copper, which enhances the coselection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and is considered detrimental to the environment and to porcine health. In our study, a combination of 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and nontargeted metabolomics was used to investigate the microbiome-metabolome responses to dietary copper levels in the hindgut of suckling piglets. The results showed that the dietary copper level affected the abundance of several Clostridia genera and that the relative abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Coprococcus, Roseburia, and Acidaminococcus, was reduced in the 300 mg kg (high) Cu group. Metabolomic analysis revealed that dietary copper levels affected protein and carbohydrate metabolites, protein biosynthesis, the urea cycle, galactose metabolism, , and amino acid metabolism (including the metabolism of arginine, proline, β-alanine, phenylalanine, , and methionine). Furthermore, Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the abundance levels of Coprococcus (family Lachnospiraceae) and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) 18 (family Ruminococcaceae) were positively correlated with energy metabolism pathways (, glycolysis, and the pentose phosphate pathway). The abundance of Streptococcus was negatively correlated with amino acid metabolism pathways (protein biosynthesis, glycine, serine, threonine, methionine, phenylalanine, and  metabolism), and OTU583 and OTU1067 (family Rikenellaceae) were positively correlated with amino acid metabolism pathways. These results suggest that the copper levels consumed by LC (low-copper group) versus HC (high-copper group) animals alter the composition of the gut microbiota and modulate microbial metabolic pathways, which may further affect the health of suckling piglets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12118006>Epigallocatechin gallate, a constituent of green tea, represses hepatic glucose production.</a></h2><p>Herbs have been used for medicinal purposes, including the treatment of diabetes, for centuries. Plants containing flavonoids are used to treat diabetes in Indian medicine and the green tea flavonoid, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), is reported to have glucose-lowering effects in animals. We show here that the regulation of hepatic glucose production is decreased by EGCG. Furthermore, like insulin, EGCG increases  phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and it reduces phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene expression in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent manner. EGCG also mimics insulin by increasing phosphoinositide 3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and p70(s6k) activity. EGCG differs from insulin, however, in that it affects several insulin-activated kinases with slower kinetics. Furthermore, EGCG regulates genes that encode gluconeogenic enzymes and protein- phosphorylation by modulating the redox state of the cell. These results demonstrate that changes in the redox state may have beneficial effects for the treatment of diabetes and suggest a potential role for EGCG, or derivatives, as an antidiabetic agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4049384>The effects of phenobarbital, atropine, L-alpha-methyldopa, and DL-propranolol on dieldrin-induced hyperglycemia in the adult rat.</a></h2><p>The hyperglycemic response of adult male Wistar rats given dieldrin (63 mg/kg, po) and either phenobarbital (40 mg/kg, ip), atropine (4 mg/kg, sc), L-alpha-methyldopa (200 mg/kg, ip), or DL-propranolol (8 mg/kg, sc) was studied. The hyperglycemia was maximal (73% above control values) 2 hr after exposure to dieldrin alone. Phenobarbital reduced the hyperglycemia by 41% and abolished dieldrin-induced convulsions. It also prevented the increases that dieldrin causes in hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activity. These results suggest that the dieldrin-induced hyperglycemia is mediated via the CNS. Atropine prevented the hyperglycemia for 2 hr and delayed the attainment of maximal glucose concentrations for another 2 hr. However, additional atropine 4, 8, 12, and 18 hr after the dieldrin had no effect. Atropine also increased (125%) the time to the onset of dieldrin-induced convulsions. It did not alter hepatic PEPCK activity. L-alpha-Methyldopa decreased (24%) the hyperglycemic response in the first 2 hr after dieldrin treatment. It caused similar reductions in blood glucose when given during the peak hyperglycemic response. L-alpha-Methyldopa also reduced (49%) the dieldrin-effected increase in hepatic PEPCK activity. DL-Propranolol did not alter the effects of dieldrin. Thus these data suggest that the dieldrin-induced hyperglycemia is mediated by the CNS, primarily via enhanced cholinergic activity and secondarily by increased alpha-adrenergic activity. It is suggested that the pancreas responds to the cholinergic outflow by increasing the secretion of glucagon while simultaneously responding to the alpha-adrenergic outflow by decreasing insulin secretion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27350164>GC-TOF/MS-based metabolomics approach to study the cellular immunotoxicity of deoxynivalenol on murine macrophage ANA-1 cells.</a></h2><p>Gas chromatography-time of fly/mass spectrum (GC-TOF/MS) based complete murine macrophage ANA-1 cell metabolome strategy, including the endo-metabolome and the exo-metabolome, ANA-1 cell viability assays and apoptosis induced by diverse concentrations of DON were evaluated for selection of an optimized dose for in-depth metabolomic research. Using the optimized chromatography and mass spectrometry parameters, the metabolites detected by GC-TOF/MS were identified and processed with multivariate statistical analysis, including principal componentanalysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) analysis. The data sets were screened with a t-test (P) value < 0.05, VIP value > 1, similarity value > 500, leaving 16 exo-metabolite variables and 11 endo-metabolite variables for further pathway analysis. Implementing the integration of key metabolic pathways, the metabolism pathways were categorized into two dominating types, metabolism of amino acid and glycometabolism. Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis and phenylalanine metabolism were the significant amino acids affected by the metabolic pathways, indicating statistically significant fold changes including pyruvate, serine, glycine, lactate and threonine.  or gluconeogenesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, and galactose metabolism, belonging to glycometabolism, were the pathways that were found to be primarily affected, resulting in abnormal metabolites such as glucose-1P, Glucose, gluconic acid, myo-inositol, sorbitol and glycerol.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To define the relationship between these two signaling pathways in the regulation of liver metabolism, we used genetic and pharmacological approaches to study the effects of inhibiting PTP1B on hepatic insulin signaling and expression of gluconeogenic enzymes in IRS2(-/-) mice.We analyzed glucose homeostasis and insulin signaling in liver and isolated hepatocytes from IRS2(-/-) and IRS2(-/-)/PTP1B(-/-) mice. Additionally, hepatic insulin signaling was assessed in control and IRS2(-/-) mice treated with resveratrol, an antioxidant present in red wine.In livers of hyperglycemic IRS2(-/-) mice, the expression levels of PTP1B and its association with the insulin receptor (IR) were increased. The absence of PTP1B in the double-mutant mice restored hepatic IRS1-mediated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/Akt/Foxo1 signaling. Moreover, resveratrol treatment of hyperglycemic IRS2(-/-) mice decreased hepatic PTP1B mRNA and inhibited PTP1B activity, thereby restoring IRS1-mediated PI 3-kinase/Akt/Foxo1 signaling and peripheral insulin sensitivity.By regulating the phosphorylation state of IR, PTB1B determines sensitivity to insulin in liver and exerts a unique role in the interplay between IRS1 and IRS2 in the modulation of hepatic insulin action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31460269>Rubrofusarin as a Dual Protein  Phosphate 1B and Human Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitor: An in Vitro and in Silico Study.</a></h2><p>A number of nature-derived biologically active compounds comprise glycosides. In some cases, the glycosidic residue is needed for bioactivity; however, in other cases, glycosylation just improves some pharmacokinetic/dynamic parameters. The patterns of protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and human monoamine oxidase A (hMAO-A) inhibition by rubrofusarin 6--β-d-glucopyranoside (), rubrofusarin 6--β-d-gentiobioside (), rubrofusarin triglucoside (), and cassiaside B2 () were compared with the aglycone, rubrofusarin, isolated from  seeds. Rubrofusarin showed potent inhibition against the PTP1B enzyme (IC; 16.95 ± 0.49 μM), and its glycosides reduced activity (IC; 87.36 ± 1.08 μM for  and >100 μM for -) than did the reference drug, ursolic acid (IC; 2.29 ± 0.04 μM). Similarly, in hMAO-A inhibition, rubrofusarin displayed the most potent activity with an IC value of 5.90 ± 0.99 μM, which was twice better than the reference drug, deprenyl HCl (IC; 10.23 ± 0.82 μM). An enzyme kinetic and molecular docking study revealed rubrofusarin to be a mixed-competitive inhibitor of both these enzymes. In a western blot analysis, rubrofusarin increased glucose uptake significantly and decreased the PTP1B expression in a dose-dependent manner in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, increased the expression of phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt) and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (p-IRS1) (Tyr 895), and decreased the expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), key enzymes of . Our overall results show that glycosylation retards activity; however, it reduces toxicity. Thus,  seed as functional food and rubrofusarin as a base can be used for the development of therapeutic agents against comorbid diabetes and depression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6142867>Shift of metabolism in rats with ventromedial hypothalamic lesions with respect to changes in daily rhythms of enzyme activity.</a></h2><p>Metabolic alterations in ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH)-lesioned rats were investigated by examining daily changes of enzyme activities and urea concentrations three weeks after the operation. VMH-lesions in female adult rats caused a significant elevation in the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the liver and parametrial adipose tissue. These changes suggest an increased lipogenesis. VMH-lesions also elicited an increase in activities of glucokinase (GK), pyruvate kinase (PK) and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), and a decrease in activities of phosphofructokinase (PFK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in the liver. The apparently inconsistent changes in activities of key glycolytic enzymes, GK, PK and PFK, and key gluconeogenic enzymes, G6Pase, PEPCK and FBPase in the liver may be explained by the fact that they were favorable for glucose oxidation through pentose phosphate cycle and provide NADPH for lipogenesis in the liver. Furthermore, VMH-lesions induced an increase in urea contents of the liver and serum, and elicited an increase in activity of liver  aminotransferase (TAT) and a decrease in activity of liver histidase. These changes suggest an accelerated amino acid and protein catabolism, and favor an increment in the supply of the substrate for lipogenesis. Daily rhythms of TAT, histidase activities and serum urea concentration observed in the control rats were abolished by VMH-lesions. These findings suggest that VMH-lesions elicit the loss of these daily rhythms, probably through the disturbance of the circadian rhythm of feeding behavior at this dynamic phase (three weeks after operation) of obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14769918>Liver-specific deletion of negative regulator Pten results in fatty liver and insulin hypersensitivity [corrected].</a></h2><p>In the liver, insulin controls both lipid and glucose metabolism through its cell surface receptor and intracellular mediators such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and serine-threonine kinase AKT. The insulin signaling pathway is further modulated by protein  phosphatase or lipid phosphatase. Here, we investigated the function of phosphatase and tension homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway, by targeted deletion of Pten in murine liver. Deletion of Pten in the liver resulted in increased fatty acid synthesis, accompanied by hepatomegaly and fatty liver phenotype. Interestingly, Pten liver-specific deletion causes enhanced liver insulin action with improved systemic glucose tolerance. Thus, deletion of Pten in the liver may provide a valuable model that permits the study of the metabolic actions of insulin signaling in the liver, and PTEN may be a promising target for therapeutic intervention for type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2606590>Influence of endurance training on plasma amino acid concentrations in humans at rest and after intense exercise.</a></h2><p>The influence of exercise training on plasma amino acid concentrations at rest and after exercise was examined in a highly trained group of humans and compared with the response of a control group of nontrained healthy humans. After a bout of intense exercise at the same relative work load, the trained group exhibited significantly (28%) higher plasma concentrations of alanine compared with the nontrained group (nontrained = 313.4 microM, trained = 401.3 microM). Other differences in plasma amino acid concentrations after exercise were related to initial differences present at rest before exercise. At rest, the trained group exhibited significantly higher plasma concentrations of leucine, isoleucine, and . Post-exercise ammonia and lactate levels were not significantly different between the two groups when any pre-exercise differences were statistically accounted for. Alanine plays a central role as a primary gluconeogenic substrate and as an ammonia carrier. Therefore, in light of the results presented here, we propose that the higher alanine levels observed in the endurance-trained athletes after exercise may play a physiologically relevant role in accommodation to the metabolic demands of exercise.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28132446>[Insulin-mimetic property of vanadium compounds].</a></h2><p>Vanadium is a transition metal which creates a number of inorganic and organic derivatives with various organic substances. Some of these compounds have pharmaceutical significance, e.g. vanadyl cation, vanadate and bis(maltolato) oxovanadium(IV). Vanadium compounds are competence inhibitors of protein  phosphatases (PTP). They have anti-tumor properties, capable of inhibiting cell proliferation at the concentrations of several micromoles. They also display insulin-mimetic and hypoglycemic properties. As they can increase the activity of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor, they stimulate glycogen synthesis, increase the number of GLUT-4 transporters in the cell membrane and impair . In addition to their effects on sugar metabolism, vanadium compounds increase the synthesis of fatty acids, reducing the concentration of glucose in the blood. Thanks to their mitotic properties, low concentrations of vanadium compounds are also able to induce β cell regeneration. Clinical tests have shown that vanadium compounds may be used as antidiabetic drugs with low toxicity. However, the range of therapeutic concentrations is very narrow; at concentrations as low a several micromoles vanadium compounds inhibit cell proliferation and cause apoptosis, necrosis and inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11739098>Elevated basal PI 3-kinase activity and reduced insulin signaling in sucrose-induced hepatic insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Sucrose feeding reduces the ability of insulin to suppress glucose production and hepatic . The present study examined the effect of a high-sucrose diet on early insulin-signaling steps in the liver. Rats were provided a high-starch (STD, control diet) or high-sucrose diet (HSD) for 3 wk. On the day of study, overnight-fasted rats were anesthetized and injected with either saline (n = 5/diet group) or insulin (2 mU/kg, n = 5/diet group) via the portal vein. Portal venous blood and liver tissue were harvested 2 min after injections. Portal vein plasma glucose levels were not significantly different among groups, pooled average 147 +/- 12 mg/dl. Western blot analysis revealed no significant differences in the amount of insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrates-1 and -2 (IRS-1, IRS-2), and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. In contrast, the amount of the p110beta subunit of PI 3-kinase was increased approximately 2-fold in HSD vs. STD (P < 0.05). After saline injection,  phosphorylation (pY) of IR, IRS-1, and IRS-2 was not significantly different between groups. However, PI 3-kinase activity associated with phosphorylated proteins was increased approximately 40% in HSD vs. STD (P < 0.05). After insulin injection, pY of the IR was not different between groups, whereas pY of IRS-1 and IRS-2 was reduced (P < 0.05) in HSD vs. STD. In addition, association of IRS-1 and IRS-2 with p85 was significantly reduced in HSD vs. STD. These data demonstrate that an HSD impairs insulin-stimulated early postreceptor signaling (pY of IRS proteins, IRS interaction with p85). Furthermore, the increased amount of p110beta and increased basal PI 3-kinase activity suggest a diet-induced compensatory response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15561958>Metformin prevents the development of acute lipid-induced insulin resistance in the rat through altered hepatic signaling mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Metformin reduces the incidence of progression to type 2 diabetes in humans with obesity or impaired glucose tolerance. We used an animal model to investigate whether metformin could prevent acute lipid-induced insulin resistance and the mechanisms involved. Metformin or vehicle was administered to rats daily for 1 week. Rats were studied basally, after 3.75 h of intralipid-heparin or glycerol infusion, or after 5 h of infusion with a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp between 3 and 5 h. Metformin had no effect on plasma triacylglycerol or nonesterified fatty acid concentrations and did not alter glucose turnover or gluconeogenic enzyme mRNA after lipid infusion. However, metformin normalized hepatic glucose output and increased liver glycogen during lipid infusion and clamp. Basal liver (but not muscle or fat) AMP-activated protein kinase activity was increased by metformin (by 310%; P < 0.01), associated with increased phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase. Postclamp liver but not muscle phosphorylated/total Akt protein was increased, whereas basal c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-1 and -2 protein expression were reduced (by 39 and 53%, respectively; P < 0.05). Metformin also increased hepatic basal IkappaBalpha levels (by 260%; P < 0.001) but had no effect on  phosphorylation or expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). In summary, metformin opposes the development of acute lipid-induced insulin resistance in the liver through alterations in multiple signaling pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25724108>Palmitic acid induces central leptin resistance and impairs hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in male mice.</a></h2><p>The consumption of diets rich in saturated fat largely contributes to the development of obesity in modern societies. A diet high in saturated fats can induce inflammation and impair leptin signaling in the hypothalamus. However, the role of saturated fatty acids on hypothalamic leptin signaling, and hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism remains largely undiscovered. In this study, we investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of a saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid (PA, C16:0), on central leptin sensitivity, hypothalamic leptin signaling, inflammatory molecules and hepatic energy metabolism in C57BL/6J male mice. We found that the icv administration of PA led to central leptin resistance, evidenced by the inhibition of central leptin's suppression of food intake. Central leptin resistance was concomitant with impaired hypothalamic leptin signaling (JAK2-STAT3, PKB/Akt-FOXO1) and a pro-inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL1-β, IL-6 and pIκBa) in the mediobasal hypothalamus and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei. Furthermore, the pre-administration of icv PA blunted the effect of leptin-induced decreases in mRNA expression related to  (G6Pase and PEPCK), glucose transportation (GLUT2) and lipogenesis (FAS and SCD1) in the liver of mice. Therefore, elevated central PA concentrations can induce pro-inflammatory responses and leptin resistance, which are associated with disorders of energy homeostasis in the liver as a result of diet-induced obesity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Two groups of aminoacids were considered: (1) the essential aminoacids (phenylalanine, , isoleucine, lysine, leucine, valine, arginine, histidine and methionine); (2) the non-essential aminoacids (aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid, glutamine, alanine, glycine, serine, threonine and proline). Some of the first group tended to decrease, and those of the second group to increase, immediately after partial hepatectomy. Few ketogenic aminoacids are probably oxidized to provide energy. The flux of aminoacids for  is minutely controlled, therefore, those of the second group being spared at first and set aside for protein synthesis, which increases on the second and third days after partial hepatectomy. Plasma and urinary urea, oxypurines, uric acid and allantoin did not show any significant variations after partial hepatectomy. The conclusion emerging from the present research is that, although variations in aminoacid composition and metabolism and in purine nucleotide metabolism have been demonstrated to occur in the regenerating liver, the overall nitrogen catabolism, as reflected by the principal end products, does not undergo substantial variations. The remaining liver is able to fulfil this function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30060014>Protein.</a></h2><p>Proteins are polymers of amino acids linked via α-peptide bonds. They can be represented as primary, secondary, tertiary, and even quaternary structures, but from a nutritional viewpoint only the primary (amino acid) sequence is of interest. Similarly, although there are many compounds in the body that can be chemically defined as amino acids, we are only concerned with the 20 canonical amino acids encoded in DNA, plus 5 others-ornithine, citrulline, γ-aminobutyrate, β-alanine, and taurine-that play quantitatively important roles in the body. We consume proteins, which are digested in the gastrointestinal tract, absorbed as small peptides (di- and tripeptides) and free amino acids, and then used for the resynthesis of proteins in our cells. Additionally, some amino acids are also used for the synthesis of specific (nonprotein) products, such as nitric oxide, polyamines, creatine, glutathione, nucleotides, glucosamine, hormones, neurotransmitters, and other factors. Again, such functions are not quantitatively important for most amino acids, and the bulk of amino acid metabolism is directly related to protein turnover (synthesis and degradation). For an individual in nitrogen balance, an amount of protein equal to that of the daily protein (nitrogen) intake is degraded each day with the nitrogen being excreted as urea and ammonia (with limited amounts of creatinine and uric acid). The carbon skeletons of the amino acids degraded to urea and ammonia are recovered through  or ketone synthesis, or oxidized to carbon dioxide. Of the 20 amino acids present in proteins, 9 are considered nutritionally indispensable (essential) in adult humans because the body is not able to synthesize their carbon skeletons. These 9 amino acids are leucine, valine, isoleucine, histidine, lysine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine. In addition, 2 others are made from their indispensable precursors: cysteine from methionine, and  from phenylalanine. Although arginine is needed in neonates, it appears that adults, with the possible exceptions of pregnancy in females and spermatogenesis in males, can synthesize sufficient arginine to maintain a nitrogen balance. The others, glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, asparagine, serine, glycine, proline, and alanine, can all be synthesized from glucose and a suitable nitrogen source. Under some conditions, glutamine, glutamate, glycine, proline, and arginine may be considered as conditionally indispensable, meaning that the body is not capable of synthesizing them in sufficient quantities for a specific physiologic or pathologic condition (1). Thus, any discussion of dietary protein must consider not only quantity but also quality (ratio of indispensable amino acids).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19966174>Net flux of amino acids across the portal-drained viscera and liver of the ewe during abomasal infusion of protein and glucose.</a></h2><p>The objective of the study was to measure net AA flux rates across the portal-drained viscera (PDV) and liver in the presence and absence of abomasal glucose infusion. Decreasing the fraction of AA metabolized by the mucosal cells may increase the fraction of AA being released into the blood. A potential mechanism to reduce AA catabolism by mucosal cells is to provide an alternative source of energy. We hypothesized that increasing glucose flow to the small intestine would increase net appearance of AA across the PDV. Eighteen mature ewes with sampling catheters were placed on study. The experimental design was a split-plot with a complete randomized design on the whole-plot and a Latin-square subplot with 5 periods and incremental levels of protein infusion. One-half of the ewes received abomasal glucose infusions (3.84 g/h), and all ewes received each of 5 protein abomasal infusion levels over 5 periods (0, 2.6, 5.2, 7.8, and 10.5 g/h). Net PDV release of isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, aspartate, glutamate, glutamine, proline, serine, and  increased linearly with increased protein infusion, and net PDV release of histidine, lysine, threonine, valine, alanine, and glycine did not differ with protein infusion. Net hepatic glucose release decreased with glucose infusion. With the exception of histidine, phenylalanine, and valine, net hepatic AA uptake increased linearly with increased delivery of AA to the liver. Glucose infusion increased the hepatic lysine and valine uptake and decreased phenylalanine uptake. Based on the observations in the current study, we reject our hypothesis that glucose can spare AA metabolism by PDV tissue. Our findings suggest that hepatic  can be increased in the presence of increased AA delivery to the liver and that hepatic  can be decreased with increased absorption of dietary glucose. Our findings support the concept that for most AA, hepatic transport of AA can be described by mass action kinetics; however, the rates of hepatic uptake of specific AA are upregulated directly or indirectly by elevated glucose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30993872>Metabolomics reveals tepotinib-related mitochondrial dysfunction in MET-activating mutations-driven models.</a></h2><p>Genetic aberrations in the hepatocyte growth factor receptor  kinase MET induce oncogenic addiction in various types of human cancers, advocating MET as a viable anticancer target. Here, we report that MET signaling plays an important role in conferring a unique metabolic phenotype to cellular models expressing MET-activating mutated variants that are either sensitive or resistant toward MET small molecule inhibitors. MET phosphorylation downregulated by the specific MET inhibitor tepotinib resulted in markedly decreased viability and increased apoptosis in tepotinib-sensitive cells. Moreover, prior to the induction of MET inhibition-dependent cell death, tepotinib also led to an altered metabolic signature, characterized by a prominent reduction of metabolite ions related to amino sugar metabolism, , glycine and serine metabolism, and of numerous TCA cycle-related metabolites such as succinate, malate, and citrate. Functionally, a decrease in oxygen consumption rate, a reduced citrate synthase activity, a drop in membrane potential, and an associated misbalanced mitochondrial function were observed exclusively in MET inhibitor-sensitive cells. These data imply that interference with metabolic state can be considered an early indicator of efficient MET inhibition and particular changes reported here could be explored in the future as markers of efficacy of anti-MET therapies.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15166226>Mechanism of hepatic insulin resistance in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Short term high fat feeding in rats results specifically in hepatic fat accumulation and provides a model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in which to study the mechanism of hepatic insulin resistance.

Hepatic insulin resistance could be attributed to impaired insulin-stimulated IRS-1 and IRS-2  phosphorylation. These changes were associated with activation of PKC-epsilon and JNK1. Ultimately, hepatic fat accumulation decreased insulin activation of glycogen synthase and increased . Treatment of the FF group with low dose 2,4-dinitrophenol to increase energy expenditure abrogated the development of fatty liver, hepatic insulin resistance, activation of PKC-epsilon and JNK1, and defects in insulin signaling. In conclusion, these data support the hypothesis hepatic steatosis leads to hepatic insulin resistance by stimulating  and activating PKC-epsilon and JNK1, which may interfere with  phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 and impair the ability of insulin to activate glycogen synthase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29336564>Benzophenone-4 Promotes the Growth of a Pseudomonas sp. and Biogenic Oxidation of Mn(II).</a></h2><p>Interactions between microbes and micropollutants (MPs) play a crucial role in water purification or treatment. Current studies have generally focused on the direct degradation or cometabolism of MPs. Considering the increasing interest in and importance of the roles of MPs in microbial metabolism, we adopted an Mn(II)-oxidizing Pseudomonas sp. QJX-1 using  (Tyr) as the sole carbon and nitrogen source to investigate the effects of seven MPs on its growth and function. Six MPs exhibited an inhibition effect on bacterial growth and Mn(II) oxidation. Only benzophenone-4 (BP-4) promoted the growth of QJX-1 and biogenic oxidation Mn(II), but its concentration was not directly coupled to growth, which was unexpected. RNA-seq data suggested that the addition of BP-4 did not significantly change the basic metabolic function of QJX-1, but stimulated the upregulation of the pyruvate and  metabolic pathways of Tyr for QJX-1 growth. Furthermore, protein identification and extracellular superoxide detection indicated that Mn(II) oxidation was largely driven by the formation of superoxide in response to Tyr starvation; the acceleration of superoxide production, due to BP-4 accelerating Tyr consumption, was responsible for the promotion effect of BP-4 on QJX-1 Mn(II) oxidation. Our findings highlight the dual effects that MPs can have on the growth and function of a single strain in aquatic ecosystem, i.e., the coexistence of inhibition and promotion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6143561>Morphine inhibition of the insulin-inducible form of hepatic  aminotransferase.</a></h2><p>Morphine treatment in normal intact rats caused a dose-dependent increase in hepatic  aminotransferase (TAT) activity, as demonstrable up to 2 hr of exposure to the opioid alkaloid. However, such increase in TAT activity was invariably preceded by a prior decline in the enzyme level, as observed after 15 min of morphine treatment. Such an initial decline in activity was not demonstrable in diabetic animals. Further studies indicate that morphine inhibited the insulin-induced increase in TAT activity, a phenomenon which could be reversed by the opioid antagonist naloxone. The results suggest an opioid control mechanism in the regulation of the insulin-inducible form of TAT and indicate the possibilities of a trophic role of endogenous opiates in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17805585>Action mechanism of bis(allixinato)oxovanadium(IV) as a novel potent insulin-mimetic complex: regulation of GLUT4 translocation and FoxO1 transcription factor.</a></h2><p>Bis(allixinato)oxovanadium(IV), VO(alx)(2) (alx is 3-hydroxy-5-methoxy-6-methyl-2-pentyl-4-pyrone), has been reported to act as an antidiabetic agent in streptozotocin-induced type-1-like and obesity-linked KKA(y) type 2 diabetic model mice. VO(alx)(2) is also proposed as a candidate agent for treating metabolic syndromes in animals. However, its functional mechanism is yet to be clarified. In this study, we examined whether VO(alx)(2) contributes to both the activation of the insulin signaling cascade that activates glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation and the regulation of the forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) transcription factor that controls the gene transcription of  genes. The following three important results were obtained: (1) intracellular vanadium concentration in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is higher after treatment with VO(alx)(2) than with VOSO(4); (2) VO(alx)(2) stimulates the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane following activation of the  phosphorylation of the insulin receptor beta-subunit (IRbeta) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) as well as Akt kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes; and (3) the mechanism of inhibition of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) catalytic subunit gene expression by vanadium is due to disruption of FoxO1 binding with the G6Pase promoter, which indicates that FoxO1 is phosphorylated by VO(alx)(2)-stimulated Akt in HepG2 cells. On the basis of these results, we propose that the critical functions of VO(alx)(2) involve the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling through the enhancement of  phosphorylation of IRbeta and IRS, which in turn transmits the signal to activate GLUT4 translocation, and the regulation of the DNA binding activity of the FoxO1 transcription factor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23352912>The insulin-mimetic effect of Morin: a promising molecule in diabetes treatment.</a></h2><p>Type-2 diabetes is a worldwidely diffuse disease characterized by insulin resistance that arises from alterations of receptor and/or post-receptor events of insulin signalling. Studies performed with PTP1B-deficent mice demonstrated that PTP1B is the main negative regulator of insulin signalling. Inhibition or down regulation of this enzyme causes enhanced insulin sensitivity. Hence this enzyme represents the most attractive target for development of innovative anti-diabetic drugs.Selection of new PTP1B inhibitors among an in house library of polyphenolic compounds was carried out screening their activity. The inhibition mechanism of Morin was determined by kinetic analyses. The cellular action of Morin was assayed on HepG2 cells. Analyses of the insulin signalling pathways was carried out by Western blot methods, glycogen synthesis was estimated by measuring the incorporation of [(3)H]-glucose,  rate was assayed by measuring the glucose release in the cell medium. Cell growth was estimated by cell count. Docking analysis was conducted with SwissDock program.We demonstrated that Morin: i) is a non-competitive inhibitor of PTP1B displaying a Ki in the μM range; ii) increases the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and Akt; iii) inhibits  and enhances glycogen synthesis. Morin does not enhance cell growth.We have identified Morin as a new small molecular non-competitive inhibitor of PTP1B, which behaves as an activator and sensitizer of the insulin receptor stimulating the metabolic pathways only.Our study suggests that Morin is a useful lead for development of new low Mr compounds potentially active as antidiabetic drugs.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

PGG has been known to have anti-tumor, anti-angiogenic and anti-diabetic activities. The present study revealed another underlying molecular target of PGG in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by using Illumina Human Ref-8 expression BeadChip assay. Through the Beadstudio v3 micro assay program to compare the identified genes expressed in PGG-treated MDA-MB-231 cells with untreated control, we found several unique genes that are closely associated with pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis/ and  metabolism, including PC, ACSS2, ACACA, ACYP2, ALDH3B1, FBP1, PRMT2 and COMT. Consistent with microarray data, real-time RT-PCR confirmed the significant down-regulation of these genes at mRNA level in PGG-treated MDA-MB-231 cells.

To understand the molecular basis of this cell type-specific and coordinate control, we analyzed the cis-regulatory elements of the  aminotransferase gene, which confer liver cell-specific expression in dependence of these hormones. The cAMP-responsive element (CRE) of the TAT gene is an essential element within a liver-specific enhancer and is recognized by the CRE-binding protein (CREB) in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The glucocorticoid response is mediated by a complex regulatory unit comprised of the glucocorticoid receptor and other transcription factor-binding sites. Here, we show that both the cAMP- and glucocorticoid-inducible enhancers are targets for the antagonistic effects of insulin. The insulin-responsive sequences coincide with the CREB-binding site of the cAMP-responsive enhancer and a hepatocyte nuclear factor-3-binding site within the glucocorticoid-responsive unit. This design of the hormone-dependent enhancers reflects the molecular mechanism underlying the onset of  aminotransferase expression at birth when insulin levels decrease and concentrations of glucagon and glucocorticoids increase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12507516>DYRK1 is a co-activator of FKHR (FOXO1a)-dependent glucose-6-phosphatase gene expression.</a></h2><p>Expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), one of the rate-limiting enzymes of hepatic , has recently been shown to be transactivated by the transcription factor FKHR. One of the proteins known to directly interact with FKHR is the nuclear protein kinase DYRK1A. In order to study the effects of DYRK1A on G6Pase gene expression, we generated a H4IIEC3 rat hepatoma cell line stably expressing DYRK1A by retroviral infection. Overexpression of DYRK1A increased the expression of G6Pase about threefold, as determined by Northern blotting. In transiently transfected HepG2 cells, co-expression of DYRK1A and a G6Pase promoter construct increased G6Pase promoter activity about twofold. This effect of DYRK1A was independent of its kinase activity, since a kinase-dead DYRK1A mutant as well as a point mutant of the phosphorylation site of DYRK1A in FKHR (Ser329Ala) failed to affect the effect of DYRK1A on the G6Pase expression. The effect of DYRK on the G6Pase promoter activity was produced by the isoforms DYRK1A and DYRK1B, which are localized in the nucleus, but not by DYRK2. Mutations of the FKHR-binding sites in the G6Pase promoter markedly reduced the effect of DYRK1 on the G6Pase promoter activity. In summary, the data suggest that DYRK1 is a specific co-activator of FKHR, independent of its kinase activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16199199>Metabolic derangements in deficiency of citrin, a liver-type mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier.</a></h2><p>Citrin, encoded by SLC25A13, is a liver-type mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier (AGC), of which deficiency, in autosomal recessive trait, causes neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis (NICCD) and adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). NICCD patients have jaundice, hypoproteinemia, hypoglycemia, galactosemia, growth retardation, fatty liver and multiple aminoacidemia including citrulline, methionine, threonine and . Some of the neonates who have experienced NICCD suffer from severe CTLN2 more than 10 years or several decades later. In CTLN2, neuropsychotic symptoms such as disorientation, aberrant behavior, coma and death are observed. Laboratory findings reveal hyperammonemia, citrullinemia, fatty liver and liver-specific decrease in a urea cycle enzyme, argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS). In some cases, hyperlipidemia, pancreatitis and hepatoma are accompanied with CTLN2. Citrin as a liver-type AGC plays a role in supplying aspartate to the cytosol for urea, protein and nucleotide synthesis by exchanging mitochondrial aspartate for cytosolic glutamate and proton, and transporting cytosolic NADH reducing equivalent to mitochondria as a member of malate aspartate shuttle essential for aerobic glycolysis. AGC is also important for  from lactate. Although it is difficult to explain pathogenesis of the symptoms such as cholestasis in NICCD and liver-specific decrease of ASS protein in CTLN2 from the functions of the AGC, some are understandable by the loss of citrin functions. Many CTLN2 patients have been treated with a low protein and high carbohydrate diet and glycerol at the hyperammonemic coma. We argue that those treatments may result in fatty liver, hyperlipidemia, hyperammonemia and even death due to loss of the citrin functions. Loss of citrin first cause deficiency of aspartate in the cytosol, which results in an increase in cytosolic NADH/NAD(+) ratio and then activation of fatty acid synthesis pathway to compensate the aberrant ratio. This follows inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. The peculiar fondness for food of CTLN2 patients who like protein and dislike carbohydrate and sweets may be related to their metabolic requirements.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11115349>Signaling mechanisms of altered cellular responses in trauma, burn, and sepsis: role of Ca2+.</a></h2><p>Alterations in cellular responses in various organ systems contribute to trauma-, burn-, and sepsis-related multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Such alterations in muscle contractile, hepatic metabolic, and neutrophil and T-cell inflammatory-immune responses have been shown to result from cell-signaling modulations and/or impairments in the respective cell types. Altered Ca(2+) signaling would seem to play an important role in the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle contractile dysfunction in the injury conditions; Ca(2+)-linked signaling derangement also plays a crucial role in sepsis-induced altered skeletal muscle protein catabolism and resistance to insulin-mediated glucose use. The injury-related increased hepatic  and acute-phase protein response could also be caused by a pathophysiologic up-regulation of hepatocyte Ca(2+)-signal generation. The increased oxidant production by neutrophil, a potentially detrimental inflammatory response in early stages after burn or septic injuries, seems to result from an up-regulation of both the Ca(2+)-dependent as well as Ca(2+)-independent signaling pathways. The injury conditions would seem to cause an inappropriate up-regulation of Ca(2+)-signal generation in the skeletal myocyte, hepatocyte, and neutrophil, while they lead to a down-regulation of Ca(2+) signaling in T cells. The crucial signaling derangement that causes T-cell proliferation suppression seems to be a decrease in the activation of protein  kinases, which subsequently down-regulates Ca(2+) signaling. The delineation of cell-signaling derangements in trauma, burn, or sepsis conditions can lead to development of therapeutic interventions against the disturbed cellular responses in the vital organ systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16126724>Dual specificity MAPK phosphatase 3 activates PEPCK gene transcription and increases  in rat hepatoma cells.</a></h2><p>Insulin is a key hormone that controls glucose homeostasis. In liver, insulin suppresses  by inhibiting the transcriptions of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) genes. In insulin resistance and type II diabetes there is an elevation of hepatic , which contributes to hyperglycemia. To search for novel genes that negatively regulate insulin signaling in controlling metabolic pathways, we screened a cDNA library derived from the white adipose tissue of ob/ob mice using a reporter system comprised of the PEPCK promoter placed upstream of the alkaline phosphatase gene. The mitogen-activated dual specificity protein kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP-3) was identified as a candidate gene that antagonized insulin suppression on PEPCK gene transcription from this screen. In this study, we showed that MKP-3 was expressed in insulin-responsive tissues and that its expression was markedly elevated in the livers of insulin-resistant obese mice. In addition, MKP-3 can activate PEPCK promoter in synergy with dexamethasone in hepatoma cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of MKP-3 in hepatoma cells by adenoviral infection increased the expression of PEPCK and G6Pase genes and led to elevated glucose production. Taken together, our data strongly suggests that MKP-3 plays a role in regulating gluconeogenic gene expression and hepatic . Therefore, dysregulation of MKP-3 expression and/or function in liver may contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type II diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16456236>Insulin signal mimicry as a mechanism for the insulin-like effects of vanadium.</a></h2><p>Among several metals, vanadium has emerged as an extremely potent agent with insulin-like properties. These insulin-like properties have been demonstrated in isolated cells, tissues, different animal models of type I and type II diabetes as well as a limited number of human subjects. Vanadium treatment has been found to improve abnormalities of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and of gene expression in rodent models of diabetes. In isolated cells, it enhances glucose transport, glycogen and lipid synthesis, and inhibits  and lipolysis. The molecular mechanism responsible for the insulin-like effects of vanadium compounds have been shown to involve the activation of several key components of insulin-signaling pathways that include the mitogen-activated-protein kinases (MAPKs) extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38MAPK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/protein kinase B (PKB). It is interesting that the vanadium effect on these signaling systems is independent of insulin receptor protein  kinase activity, but it is associated with enhanced  phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1. These actions seem to be secondary to vanadium-induced inhibition of protein  phosphatases. Because MAPK and PI3-K/PKB pathways are implicated in mediating the mitogenic and metabolic effects of insulin, respectively, it is plausible that mimicry of these pathways by vanadium serves as a mechanism for its insulin-like responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12172480>Inflammatory status and insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>The inflammatory response is essential in the response to pathogens. TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6 are key mediators of the response. They initiate metabolic changes to provide nutrients for the immune system, from host tissues. These changes include hyperlipidemia and increased . Insulin resistance and disordering of lipid metabolism occur in obesity, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis. This review examines recent research that links inflammation to insulin insensitivity.Population studies show a strong association between indices of inflammation, and abnormal lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, obesity and atherosclerosis. TNF-alpha is produced, by cells of the immune system and by adipocytes. It may provide the link between inflammation and insulin sensitivity. TNF-alpha results in insulin insensitivity, indirectly by stimulating stress hormone production and directly by sustained induction of SOCS-3 which decreases insulin-induced insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1)  phosphorylation and its association with the p85, regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase; and by negative regulation of PPAR gamma. Adipose tissue produces both TNF-alpha and leptin. Production of the latter relates positively to adipose tissue mass and through its actions on immune function exerts a pro-inflammatory influence.Recent studies on diseases which involve insulin insensitivity (e.g. obesity, type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis) also show increased cytokine production and markers of inflammation. Evidence at present favours chronic inflammation as a trigger for chronic insulin insensitivity, rather than the reverse situation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6201410>Re-expression of hepatic functions in mouse hepatoma X rat hepatoma hybrids.</a></h2><p>Neonatal hepatic functions are selectively extinguished in hybrids between mouse hepatoma cells, that express only fetal hepatic functions, and rat hepatoma cells expressing neonatal as well as fetal functions. A search for hybrid cells reexpressing these neonatal functions was undertaken to determine; (1) whether the selective extinction of neonatal functions is reversible and at what frequency, and (2) whether the re-expression of neonatal functions would be accompanied by modifications in the expression of fetal functions. The criterion used to obtain hybrids showing re-expression was glucose-free medium (G) where growth requires the presence of the extinguished gluconeogenic enzymes. Even though the parental cells are of the same histotype it proved difficult to obtain re-expression. Survivors in G- were obtained only from hybrids containing a greater than 1s complement of rat chromosomes; they reexpress not only gluconeogenic enzymes but also basal  aminotransferase activity, and the fetal hepatic function alpha-fetoprotein continues to be expressed in most of the clones. All survivors in G- display a significant loss of chromosomes and this loss concerns essentially mouse chromosomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24996005>Toxic effects of chronic low-dose exposure of thioacetamide on rats based on NMR metabolic profiling.</a></h2><p>Thioacetamide (TAA) is a well-known toxicant and its long term exposure could induce liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. A liver fibrosis rat model was established by consecutive injection of TAA solution for 7 weeks. Serum and urine samples were collected weekly for NMR based metabolomic study. Clinical biochemistry of serum samples revealed liver impairment and fibrosis. Histopathological inspections disclosed severe liver fibrosis and cirrhosis formation, and pathological changes in kidney by long-term TAA administration. Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was applied on serum and urine samples to excavate differential metabolites associated with TAA induced impairment and explore the time-dependent metabolic event associated with this xenobiotic perturbation. Integration of metabolomics results with serum biochemical revealed several potential biomarkers for liver fibrosis (2-hydroxybutyrate, 3-hydroxybutyrate and adipate in urine, and phenylalanine, N,N-dimethyl glycine, O-acetyl glycoprotein, N-acetyl glycoprotein and choline in serum). Pathway analysis revealed disturbed pathways concerning tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, pyruvate metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism,  or gluconeogenesis, degradation of ketone bodies, butanoate metabolism, and biosynthesis of BCAAs (valine, leucine and isoleucine) and AAAs (phenylalanine,  and tryptophan).

Furthermore, glycogen synthase in muscle biopsies was studied in one patient with regard to enzyme activity, immunoreactive protein and mRNA levels. The patients had fasting hyperinsulinaemia, and the rate of total glucose disposal was severely impaired, primarily due to a decreased non-oxidative glucose metabolism. In the patient studied with muscle biopsy, the expected activation of glycogen synthase by insulin did not occur. In both patients there was severely increased hepatic glucose output in the basal state, suggesting a failure of insulin to suppress hepatic . During insulin infusion a substantially elevated rate of lipid oxidation remained in the patients, in contrast to the almost completely suppressed lipid oxidation in the controls. It is concluded that patients with congenital generalized lipodystrophy may present severe insulin resistance with regard to hepatic glucose production as well as muscle glycogen synthesis and lipid oxidation. The results suggest a postreceptor defect in the action of insulin in congenital generalized lipodystrophy. The further localization of such a defect is hampered by the still incomplete understanding of the pathways that link insulin-stimulated  phosphorylation to the ultimate action of insulin upon target cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28564652>Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Improves Hepatic Glucose Metabolism Involving Down-Regulation of Protein  Phosphatase 1B in Obese Rats.</a></h2><p>This study was initiated to investigate the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery on hepatic glucose metabolism and hepatic expression of protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) in obese rats.Body weight, glucose, intraperitoneal glucose, insulin, and pyruvate tolerance tests were performed pre- and postoperatively, and plasma lipid, insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) were measured.

The intracellular localization of PTP1B and hepatic glycogen deposition was also observed.RYGB surgery-treated rats showed persistent weight loss, significantly improved glucose tolerance, pyruvate tolerance, and dyslipidemia, as well as increased insulin sensitivity, hepatic glycogen deposition and increased plasma GLP-1 in obese rats. RT-PCR analyses showed Pepck, G6Pase, and Gsk-3β mRNA to be significantly decreased, and Gys-2 mRNA to be significantly increased in liver tissue in the RYGB group (p < 0.05 vs. high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD + sham group); in addition, the expression of PTP1B were significantly decreased and insulin signaling were improved in the RYGB group (p < 0.05 vs. HFD or HFD + sham group).RYGB can improve hepatic glucose metabolism and down-regulate PTP1B in obese rats.

The low affinity neurotrophin receptor p75 is a clock component directly regulated by the transcriptional factor Clock:Bmal1 complex. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is expressed in the brain and plays a key role in coordinating metabolic interactions between neurons and astrocytes. BDNF transduces signals through TrkB and p75 receptors. This review highlights a novel molecular mechanism by which BDNF via circadian control of p75 leads to daily resetting of glucose and glycogen metabolism in brain astrocytes to accommodate their functional interaction with neurons. Astrocytes store glycogen as an energy reservoir to provide active neurons with the glycolytic metabolite lactate. Astrocytes predominantly express the truncated receptor TrkB.T1 which lacks an intracellular receptor  kinase domain. TrkB.T1 retains the capacity to regulate cell morphology through regulation of Rho GTPases. In contrast, p75 mediates generation of the bioactive lipid ceramide upon stimulation with BDNF and inhibits PKA activation. As ceramide directly activates PKCζ, we discuss the importance of the TrkB.T1-p75-ceramide-PKCζ signaling axis in the stimulation of glycogen and lipid synthesis and activation of RhoA. Ceramide-PKCζ-casein kinase 2 signaling activates Nrf2 to support oxidative phosphorylation via upregulation of antioxidant enzymes. In the absence of p75, TrkB.T1 functionally interacts with adenosine AR and dopamine D1R receptors to enhance cAMP-PKA signaling and activate Rac1 and NF-κB c-Rel, favoring glycogen hydrolysis,  and aerobic glycolysis. Thus, diurnal changes in p75 levels in astrocytes resets energy metabolism via BDNF to accommodate their metabolic interaction with neurons.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Neither blood flow nor O2 consumption across the portal-drained viscera (PDV) and liver was significantly altered by infusion. Similarly, there were no effects on net absorption, or hepatic removal, of acetate, propionate, butyrate or NH3. Glucose PDV appearance was unchanged but hepatic glucose production increased (P = 0.032) by 0.2 mumol/min per mumol/min of AA infused. Additional extraction of alanine, glycine (both infused) and glutamine (not infused) by the liver was sufficient to account for most of the extra C required for glucose synthesis. The N that would be liberated from these glucogenic AA would also account for a large proportion of the increase in urea-N produced in response to the AA infusion. This supports the concept of a correlation between  and ureagenesis. Furthermore, the amide-N liberated from the extracted glutamine would contribute up to 0.17 of hepatic NH3 flux and assist in balancing N inputs into the carbamoyl phosphate and arginosuccinate entry points of the ornithine cycle. Rates of fractional extraction of the various AA by the liver were best fitted by linear equations, indicating that even at the highest rates of administration (approximately twice maximal physiological absorption) the transport systems were not saturated. Hepatic fractional extractions of infused essential AA were highest for methionine (0.83) and phenylalanine (0.87) with the lowest proportion removed observed for valine (0.25), leucine (0.30), lysine (0.31) and isoleucine (0.49). For the non-essential AA, the highest apparent fractional extractions were for glycine (0.73), arginine (0.79) and  (0.63) followed by alanine (0.54), proline (0.47) and serine (0.37). Hepatic removal of AA-N exceeded the increase in urea-N formation such that, at the highest rate of infusion, approximately 10 mmol/min of the extracted AA was apparently available for hepatic anabolism, more than is required to account for assumed increases in liver mass and export protein synthesis. Similarly, the amount of AA available for peripheral tissue protein gain, when assessed against phenylalanine supply as the limitation, would be the equivalent of a maximum of 0.5 g protein retained/min (6 mmol AA-N/min). This would provide sufficient AA for replenishment of peripheral (muscle) protein stores plus support of the placenta and fetus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29205863>(-)-Epicatechin and the Colonic 2,3-Dihydroxybenzoic Acid Metabolite Regulate Glucose Uptake, Glucose Production, and Improve Insulin Signaling in Renal NRK-52E Cells.</a></h2><p>(-)-Epicatechin (EC) and main colonic phenolic acids derived from flavonoid intake, such as 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DHPAA), 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (HPPA), and vanillic acid (VA), have been suggested to exert beneficial effects in diabetes, although the mechanism for their actions remains unknown. In this study, the modulation of glucose homeostasis and insulin signaling by the mentioned compounds on renal proximal tubular NRK-52E cells is investigated.Levels of the glucose transporters SGLT-2 and GLUT-2, as well as glucose uptake, glucose production, and key proteins of the insulin pathways, namely insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and PI3K/AKT pathway are analyzed. EC (5-20 μm) and DHBA (20 μm) reduced both renal glucose uptake and production. Interestingly, EC and DHBA did not modify the levels of SGLT-2 and GLUT-2, and modulated the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase via AKT leading to a diminished glucose production. EC and DHBA also enhanced the  phosphorylation and total IR and IRS-1 levels, and activated the PI3K/AKT pathway in NRK-52E cells.EC and DHBA regulate the renal glucose homeostasis by modulating both glucose uptake and production, and strengthen the insulin signaling by activating key proteins of that pathway in NRK-52E cells.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the presence of PAA, in vitro capacitation of dog spermatozoa suffered alterations, which translated into changes in capacitation functional markers, like the increase in the percentage of altered acrosomes, a distinct motion pattern, decrease or even disappearance of capacitation-induced  phosphorylation, and increased heterogeneity of the chlorotetracycline pattern in capacitated cells. Thus, this is the first report indicating the existence of a functional glyconeogenesis in mammalian spermatozoa. Moreover, -linked glycogen metabolism seems to be of importance in the maintenance of a correct in vitro capacitation in dog sperm in the absence of hexoses in the medium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20801894>Dietary protein deprivation upregulates insulin signaling and inhibits  in rat liver.</a></h2><p>This study was undertaken to elucidate the effects of dietary protein deprivation on glucose metabolism and hepatic insulin signaling in rats. The results of glucose and pyruvate tolerance tests in rats fed with a 12% casein diet (12C) and a protein-free diet (PF) indicated that protein deprivation enhanced clearance of blood glucose and suppressed . Correspondingly, the mRNA level of hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, a key gluconeogenic enzyme, was suppressed by dietary protein deprivation. In PF-fed rats, total  phosphorylation of insulin receptor (IR) in the liver induced by insulin injection was enhanced compared with 12C pair-fed rats due to an increase in IR protein level. In addition, protein deprivation caused an increase in protein levels of IR substrate 1 (IRS1) and IRS2, leading to the marked enhancement of insulin-induced  phosphorylation of IRS2 and its binding to the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Based on these results, we conclude that protein deprivation suppresses  by a mechanism primarily mediated by the enhancement of the insulin signals through the IR/IRS/PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 pathway in the liver. Taken together with our previous report, these findings suggest that tissue-specific potentiation of insulin action in the liver and the skeletal muscle plays important roles in maintaining glucose homeostasis even when energy usage is reduced by dietary protein deprivation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19665995>Curcumin activates AMPK and suppresses gluconeogenic gene expression in hepatoma cells.</a></h2><p>Curcumin, the bioactive component of curry spice turmeric, and its related structures possess potent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Several lines of evidence suggest that curcumin may play a beneficial role in animal models of diabetes, both by lowering blood glucose levels and by ameliorating the long-term complications of diabetes. However, current understanding of the mechanism of curcumin action is rudimentary and is limited to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study we examine potential anti-diabetic mechanisms of curcumin, curcumin C3 complex), and tetrahydrocurcuminoids (THC). Curcuminoids did not exert a direct effect on receptor  kinase activity, 2-deoxy glucose uptake in L6-GLUT4myc cells, or intestinal glucose metabolism measured by DPP4/alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity. We demonstrate that curcuminoids effectively suppressed dexamethasone-induced phosphoenol pyruvate carboxy kinase (PEPCK) and glucose6-phosphatase (G6Pase) in H4IIE rat hepatoma and Hep3B human hepatoma cells. Furthermore, curcuminoids increased the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in H4IIE and Hep3B cells with 400 times (curcumin) to 100,000 times (THC) the potency of metformin. These results suggest that AMPK mediated suppression of hepatic  may be a potential mechanism mediating glucose-lowering effects of curcuminoids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28512464>Insights into the Mechanism of Proliferation on the Special Microbes Mediated by Phenolic Acids in the  Rhizosphere under Continuous Monoculture Regimes.</a></h2><p>As potent allelochemicals, phenolic acids are believed to be associated with replanting disease and cause microflora shift and structural disorder in the rhizosphere soil of continuously monocultured .

To test whether leptin interferes directly with insulin signaling, we perfused isolated rat livers with leptin (0.1, 0.5, 5, and 25 nmol/liter), leptin + insulin (5 nmol/liter + 10 nmol/liter), insulin (10 nmol/liter), or vehicle (control). Leptin reduced L-lactate-(10 mmol/liter)-stimulated glucose production by 39-66% (P < 0.006 vs. control) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activity by 22-52% (P < 0.001). Physiological leptin concentrations (0.1-5 nmol/liter) stimulated the  phosphorylation (pY) of insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) (280-954%; P < 0.05) and its associated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activity (122-621%; P < 0.003). Leptin (0.5-25 nmol/liter) inhibited IRS-1 pY and its associated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activity (20-89%; P < 0.03) but stimulated janus kinase-2 pY (272-342%; P < 0.001). Leptin also down-regulated its short receptor isoform in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (28-54%; P < 0.05). Exposure to leptin + insulin additively reduced glucose production and PEPCK activity (approximately 50%; P < 0.001 vs. control) and doubled IRS-2 pY (P < 0.01 vs. insulin). However, leptin + insulin decreased IRS-1 pY by 57% (P < 0.01 vs. insulin). Insulin alone (P < 0.01), but not leptin, increased autophosphorylation of nonreceptor  kinases (pp59(Lyn) + pp125(Fak)). In conclusion, leptin both alone and in combination with insulin reduces hepatic glucose production by decreasing the synthesis of the key enzyme of , PEPCK, which results mainly from the stimulation of the IRS-2 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16613706>[A difficult and complicated case study: neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency].</a></h2><p>Neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD) is a kind of inborn errors of metabolism, with the main clinic manifestations of jaundice, hepatomegaly, and abnormal liver function indices. As a mitochondrial solute carrier protein, citrin plays important roles in aerobic glycolysis, , urea cycle, and protein and nucleotide syntheses. Therefore citrin deficiency causes various and complicated metabolic disturbances, such as hypoglycemia, hyperlactic acidemia, hyperammonemia, hypoproteinemia, hyperlipidemia, and galactosemia. This paper reported a case of NICCD confirmed by mutation analysis of SLC25A13, the gene encoding citrin. The baby (male, 6 months old) was referred to the First Affiliated Hospital with the complaint of jaundice of the skin and sclera, which it had suffered from for nearly 6 months. Physical examination showed obvious jaundice and a palpable liver 5 cm below the right subcostal margin. Liver function tests revealed elevated enzymatic activities, like GGT, ALP, AST, and ALT, together with increased levels of TBA, bilirubin (especially conjugated bilirubin), and decreased levels of total protein/albumin and fibrinogen. Blood levels of ammonia, lactate, cholesterol, and triglyceride were also increased, and in particular, the serum AFP level reached 319,225.70 microg/L, a extremely elevated value that has rarely been found in practice before. Tandem mass analysis of a dried blood sample revealed increased levels of free fatty acids and , methionine, citrulline, and threonine as well. UP-GC-MS analysis of the urine sample showed elevated galactose and galactitol. The baby was thus diagnosed with suspected NICCD based on the findings. It was then treated with oral arginine and multiple vitamins (including fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K), and was fed with lactose-free and medium-chain fatty acids enriched formula instead of breast feeding. After half a month of treatment, the jaundice disappeared, and the laboratory findings, including liver function indices, blood levels of ammonia, lactate and AFP, were returned to normal level. The baby was followed up for 6 months. It developed well, and the abnormal laboratory findings, including MS-MS and UP-GC-MS analysis results, have been corrected, except a slightly elevated lactate level sometimes. SLC25A13 gene mutation analysis for the patient revealed a compound heterozygote of mutation 851del4 and 1638ins23 and therefore NICCD was definitely diagnosed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29712668>TCPTP Regulates Insulin Signaling in AgRP Neurons to Coordinate Glucose Metabolism With Feeding.</a></h2><p>Insulin regulates glucose metabolism by eliciting effects on peripheral tissues as well as the brain. Insulin receptor (IR) signaling inhibits AgRP-expressing neurons in the hypothalamus to contribute to the suppression of hepatic glucose production (HGP) by insulin, whereas AgRP neuronal activation attenuates brown adipose tissue (BAT) glucose uptake. The  phosphatase TCPTP suppresses IR signaling in AgRP neurons. Hypothalamic TCPTP is induced by fasting and degraded after feeding. Here we assessed the influence of TCPTP in AgRP neurons in the control of glucose metabolism. TCPTP deletion in AgRP neurons (-Cre; ) enhanced insulin sensitivity, as assessed by the increased glucose infusion rates, and reduced HGP during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, accompanied by increased [C]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake in BAT and browned white adipose tissue. TCPTP deficiency in AgRP neurons promoted the intracerebroventricular insulin-induced repression of hepatic  in otherwise unresponsive food-restricted mice, yet had no effect in fed/satiated mice where hypothalamic TCPTP levels are reduced. The improvement in glucose homeostasis in -Cre; mice was corrected by IR heterozygosity (-Cre; ; ), causally linking the effects on glucose metabolism with the IR signaling in AgRP neurons. Our findings demonstrate that TCPTP controls IR signaling in AgRP neurons to coordinate HGP and brown/beige adipocyte glucose uptake in response to feeding/fasting.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11369167>Metabolic effects of intraportal nutrition in humans.</a></h2><p>We investigated the metabolic effects of intravenous nutrition through a portal (PN) or systemic (SN) peripheral vein.Twenty patients were randomized to receive PN or SN nutrition after colorectal surgery.

Acute neurological crisis is also a cause of death. Traditionally the treatment has been with diet, but for a decade liver transplantation has been the ultimate treatment. The continuous production of the pathological metabolites in the kidneys after transplantation appears to be without significance. Introduction of the enzyme inhibitor NTBC in the treatment of tyrosinaemia has reduced the need for liver transplants. Neonatal screening may be justified as efficient treatment has become available. The complex phenotype of lethal albino mice, with severe alterations in gene expression, has been shown to be caused by fumarylacetoacetase deficiency. Prolonged hypoglycaemia in otherwise adequately treated tyrosinaemia patients may result from depressed expression of genes coding for enzymes in , as seen in the mouse model.

Though the metabolic effects of insulin are well established, the components linking insulin signal transduction to a metabolic response are not as well understood. Here, we show that Cdc2-like kinase 2 (Clk2) is an insulin-regulated suppressor of hepatic  and glucose output. Clk2 protein levels and kinase activity are induced as part of the hepatic refeeding response by the insulin/Akt pathway. Clk2 directly phosphorylates the SR domain on PGC-1alpha, resulting in repression of gluconeogenic gene expression and hepatic glucose output. In addition, Clk2 is downregulated in db/db mice, and reintroduction of Clk2 largely corrects glycemia. Thus, we have identified a role for and regulation of the Clk2 kinase as a component of hepatic insulin signaling and glucose metabolism.2010 Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2434517>Phosphorylation of glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes by the insulin receptor kinase.</a></h2><p>Various glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes were tested as substrates for the insulin receptor kinase. Phosphofructokinase and phosphoglycerate mutase were found to be the best substrates. Phosphorylation of these enzymes was rapid, stimulated 2- to 6-fold by 10(-7) M insulin and occurred exclusively on  residues. Enolase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, lactate dehydrogenases in decreasing order, were also subject to insulin-stimulated phosphorylation but to a smaller extent than that for phosphofructokinase or phosphoglycerate mutase. The phosphorylation of phosphofructokinase was studied most extensively since phosphofructokinase is known to catalyze a rate-limiting step in glycolysis. The apparent Km of the insulin receptor for phosphofructokinase was 0.1 microM, which is within the physiologic range of concentration of this enzyme in most cells.  phosphorylation of phosphofructokinase paralleled autophosphorylation of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor with respect to time course, insulin dose response (half maximal effect between 10(-9) and 10(-8) M insulin), and cation requirement (Mn2+ greater than Mg2+ much greater than Ca2+).

As part of a systematic study of the structural features of the chymostatin molecule that are responsible for this inhibitory activity, a series of fifteen di- and tripeptide analogues of chymostatin were tested for their ability to suppress protein degradation in isolated primary hepatocytes. Protein degradation was assessed in two ways: by the release of radiolabel from proteins prelabelled in vivo (to which both lysosomal and non-lysosomal processes contribute) and by the rate of inactivation of  aminotransferase, a process that is exclusively non-lysosomal. All inhibitors were relatively non-toxic and did not affect the intracellular ATP levels, although some suppression of  was observed in the presence of leupeptin, chymostatin or the analogues. Tripeptide phenylalanine aldehydes or semicarbazones were at least as effective as chymostatin in reducing protein degradation, whereas peptide alcohols were relatively ineffective. Replacement of the basic capreomycidine moiety in chymostatin with an arginine residue improved the inhibitory activity but equally, substitution of the arginine residue with an uncharged norleucine residue was without significant effect. The structural features that are optimal for inhibition of chymotrypsin or other serine proteinases (previously defined) are not as critical for inhibition of protein degradation in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8779972>In vivo amino acid metabolism of gut and liver during short and prolonged starvation.</a></h2><p>During starvation, splanchnic organs are proportionally more affected by protein loss than other organs.

To study in vivo phenylalanine and  membrane transport and protein turnover in splanchnic organs, a primed continuous infusion of L-[2,6-3H]phenylalanine was given to control rats (postabsorptive) and after short (40 h) and prolonged (112 h) starvation.

Inward and outward amino acid plasma-tissue membrane transport rates in both the liver and gut were upregulated after prolonged starvation. Metabolic shunting of phenylalanine and  increased in the gut but decreased to zero in the liver after prolonged starvation. In conjunction with this, gut and liver protein turnover increased after prolonged starvation. In the liver the net uptake of gluconeogenic precursors also increased, indicative for increased . The observed changes in amino acid metabolism in both splanchnic organs after prolonged starvation may reflect an adaptation of the gut and liver to nutritional deprivation and could be of benefit during refeeding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7792824>Molecular genetic analysis of glucocorticoid signaling during mouse development.</a></h2><p>Glucocorticoids are important in a number of developmental processes in mammals around birth. The pathway of  is activated in liver shortly after birth due to the combined effects of glucocorticoids and glucagon. We have defined the essential cis-regulatory elements directing hormone-dependent liver-specific expression of the gene for  aminotransferase, a key gluconeogenic enzyme. The hormone response elements synergize with cell-type specific elements. In the case of glucocorticoids, the glucocorticoid-dependent enhancer is composed of the glucocorticoid response element and binding sites for liver cell-enriched transcription factors, in particular hepatocyte nuclear factor-3. The dependence of the respective enhancer motifs on each other restricts the hormonal activation of the  aminotransferase gene in liver in response to a hormonal signal. To further understand the role of glucocorticoid signaling via the type II glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the perinatal period and earlier during development, we have studied the expression of the mouse GR gene. Expression of the gene is controlled by at least three promoters, one of which is only active in T-lymphocytes. Expression of GR mRNA has been detected as early as day 9.5 of mouse development. To specifically address the role of glucocorticoid signaling via the GR during development, we have disrupted the GR gene by homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells. The majority of GR mutants die shortly after birth and analysis so far has revealed defects in lung, liver, and adrenal function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2906528>Liver functions in hepatocytes entrapped within calcium alginate.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16443359>Compendium of the antidiabetic effects of supranutritional selenate doses. In vivo and in vitro investigations with type II diabetic db/db mice.</a></h2><p>In recent years, a number of investigations on the antidiabetic effects of supranutritional selenate doses have been carried out. Selenate (selenium oxidation state +VI) was shown to possess regulatory effects on glycolysis,  and fatty acid metabolism, metabolic pathways which are disturbed in diabetic disorders. An enhanced phosphorylation of single components of the insulin signalling pathway could be shown to be one molecular mechanism responsible for the insulinomimetic properties of selenate. In type II diabetic animals, a reduction of insulin resistance could be shown as an outcome of selenate treatment. The present study with db/db mice was performed to investigate the antidiabetic mechanisms of selenate in type II diabetic animals. Twenty-one young adult female db/db mice were randomly assigned to three experimental groups (selenium deficient=0Se, selenite-treated group=SeIV and selenate-treated group=SeVI) with seven animals each. Mice of all groups were fed a selenium-deficient diet for 8 weeks. The animals of the groups SeIV and SeVI were supplemented with increasing amounts of sodium selenite or sodium selenate up to 35% of the LD50 in week 8 in addition to the diet by tube feeding. Selenate treatment reduced insulin resistance significantly and reduced the activity of liver cytosolic protein  phosphatases (PTPs) as negative regulators of insulin signalling by about 50%. In an in vitro inhibition test selenate (oxidation state +VI) per se did not inhibit PTP activity. In this test, however, selenium compounds of the oxidation state +IV were found to be the actual inhibitors of PTP activity. Selenate administration in vivo further led to characteristic changes in the selenium-dependent redox system, which could be mimicked in an in vitro assay and provided further evidence for the intermediary formation of SeIV metabolites. The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), another important factor in the context of insulin resistance and lipid metabolism, was significantly increased by selenate application. In particular, liver  and lipid metabolism were influenced strongly by selenate treatment. In conclusion, our results showed that supranutritional selenate doses influenced two important mechanisms involved in insulin-resistant diabetes, namely, PTPs and PPARgamma, which, in turn, can be assumed as being responsible for the changes in intermediary metabolism, e.g.,  and lipid metabolism. The initiation of these mechanisms thereby seems to be coupled to the intermediary formation of the selenium oxidation state +IV (selenite state) from selenate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2690816> kinase activity of liver insulin receptor is inhibited in rats at term gestation.</a></h2><p>Late gestation is associated with insulin resistance in rats and humans. It has been reported that rats at term gestation show active hepatic  and glycogenolysis, and diminished lipogenesis, despite normal or mildly elevated plasma insulin concentrations, indicating a state of resistance to the hormone action. Since autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor has been reported to play a key role in the hormone signal transduction, we have partially purified plasma-membrane liver insulin receptors from virgin and 22-day-pregnant rats and studied their binding and kinase activities. (1) Insulin binding to partially purified receptors does not appear to be influenced by gestation, as indicated by the observed KD and Bmax. values. (2) The rate of autophosphorylation and the maximal 32P incorporation into the receptor beta-subunit from pregnant rats at saturating concentrations of insulin are markedly decreased with respect to the corresponding values for virgin rats. (3) The diminished autophosphorylation rate was due to a decreased responsiveness of the kinase activity to the action of insulin. (4) Phosphorylation of the exogenous substrates casein and poly(Glu80Tyr20) by insulin-receptor kinase was also less when receptors from pregnant rats were used. These results show the existence of an impairment at the receptor kinase level of the insulin signalling mechanism that might be related to the insulin-resistant state characteristic of term gestation in rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24026800>Grape seed proanthocyanidins and metformin act by different mechanisms to promote insulin signaling in rats fed high calorie diet.</a></h2><p>Key pathways like insulin signaling, AMP activated kinase (AMPK) activation and inflammatory signaling are involved in the complex pathological network of hepatic insulin resistance. Our aim is to investigate whether grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSP) and metformin (MET) target any of these pathways in insulin resistant rat liver. Albino Wistar rats were rendered insulin resistant by feeding a high fat-fructose diet (HFFD). Either GSP (100 mg/kg b.w), MET(50 mg/kg b.w) or both were administered to insulin resistant rats as therapeutic options. HFFD-feeding caused hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, increased , decreased  phosphorylation of insulin receptor-β(IR-β) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. The association of p85α subunit of phosphotidyl inositol 3 kinase(PI3K) with IRS-1 and subsequent Akt phosphorylation were reduced while the expression of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) were increased in HFFD rats. Both MET and GSP reduced hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia and improved glycolysis,  phosphorylation of IR-β and IRS-1, IRS-1-PI3K association and Akt activation. However, activation of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, leptin and suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 and reduction in adiponectin caused by chronic HFFD feeding were reversed by GSP better than by MET. Activation of AMPK by GSP was much less compared to that by MET. These findings suggest that GSP might activate PI3K pathway and promote insulin action by reducing serine kinase activation and cytokine signaling and MET by targeting AMPK. The beneficial effects were enhanced during combination therapy. Thus, combination therapy with MET and GSP may be considered for the management of metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1820332>Mechanism of action of ochratoxin A.</a></h2><p>Ochratoxin A has a number of toxic effects in mammals, the most notable of which is nephrotoxicity. It is also immunosuppressive, teratogenic and carcinogenic. The biochemical and molecular aspects of its action were first studied in bacteria. The appearance of 'magic spots' (ppGpp and pppGpp) pointed to inhibition of the charging of transfer ribonucleic acids (tRNA) with amino acids. This suggestion was confirmed by the demonstration that ochratoxin A inhibits bacterial, yeast and liver phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases. The inhibition is competitive to phenylalanine and is reversed by an excess of this amino acid. As a consequence, protein synthesis is inhibited, as shown with hepatoma cells in culture, with Madin Darby canine kidney cells (which are much more sensitive) and in vivo in mouse liver, kidney and spleen, the inhibition being more effective in the latter two organs. An excess of phenylalanine also prevents inhibition of protein synthesis in cell cultures and in vivo. Analogues of ochratoxin A in which phenylalanine has been replaced by other amino acids have similar inhibitory effects on the respective amino acid-specific aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. 4R-Hydroxyochratoxin A, a metabolite of ochratoxin A, has a similar action, whereas ochratoxin alpha (the dihydroisocoumarin moiety) and ochratoxin B (ochratoxin A without chlorine) have no effect. Ochratoxin A might act on other enzymes that use phenylalanine as a substrate. We showed recently that it inhibits phenylalanine hydroxylase. In addition, the phenylalanine moiety of ochratoxin A is partially hydroxylated to  by incubation with hepatocytes and in vivo. This competitive action with phenylalanine might explain why this amino acid prevents the immuno-suppressive effect of ochratoxin A and partially prevents its teratogenic and nephrotoxic actions. The effect of ochratoxin A on protein synthesis is followed by an inhibition of RNA synthesis, which might affect proteins with a high turnover. Ochratoxin A also lowers the level of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, a key enzyme in ; this inhibition is reported to be due to a specific degradation of mRNA that codes for this enzyme. Recently, ochratoxin A was also found to enhance lipid peroxidation both in vitro and in vivo. This inhibition might have an important effect on cell or mitochondrial membranes and be responsible for the effects on mitochondria that have been shown by several authors. Finally, the recent results of Pfohl-Leszkowicz et al. (this volume), who showed the formation of DNA adducts mainly in kidney but also in liver and spleen, explain the DNA single-strand breaks observed previously in mice and rats after acute and chronic treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29932826>Proteomic determination of the lysine acetylome and phosphoproteome in the rat native inner medullary collecting duct.</a></h2><p>Phosphorylation and lysine (K)-acetylation are dynamic posttranslational modifications of proteins. Previous proteomic studies have identified over 170,000 phosphorylation sites and 15,000 K-acetylation sites in mammals. We recently reported that the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD), which functions in the regulation of water-reabsorption, via the actions of vasopressin, expresses many of the enzymes that can modulated K-acetylation. The purpose of this study was to determine the K-acetylated or phosphorylated proteins expressed in IMCD cells. Second we questioned whether vasopressin V2 receptor activation significantly affects the IMCD acetylome or phosphoproteome? K-acetylated or serine-, threonine-, or -phosphorylated peptides were identified from native rat IMCDs by proteomic analysis with four different enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin, ASP-N, or Glu-C) to generate a high-resolution proteome. K-acetylation was identified in 431 unique proteins, and 64% of the K-acetylated sites were novel. The acetylated proteins were expressed in all compartments of the cell and were enriched in pathways including glycolysis and vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption. In the vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption pathway, eight proteins were acetylated, including the novel identification of the basolateral water channel, AQP3, acetylated at K282; 215 proteins were phosphorylated in this IMCD cohort, including AQP2 peptides that were phosphorylated at four serines: 256, 261, 264, and 269. Acute dDAVP did not significantly affect the IMCD acetylome; however, it did significantly affect previously known vasopressin-regulated phosphorylation sites. In conclusion, presence of K-acetylated proteins involved in metabolism, ion, and water transport in the IMCD points to multiple roles of K-acetylation beyond its canonical role in transcriptional regulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1848501>Increased insulin action in cultured hepatocytes from rats with diabetes induced by neonatal streptozotocin.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown that Wistar rats injected at birth (n0) with STZ (n0-STZ) develop as adults a noninsulin-dependent diabetic state characterized by a lack of insulin response to glucose in vivo, a mild basal hyperglycemia, and an impaired glucose tolerance. Our former in vivo studies using the insulin-glucose clamp technique revealed an increased insulin action upon hepatic glucose production in these animals. We have now cultured hepatocytes from these mildly diabetic rats in parallel with hepatocytes from control rats, to examine more closely basal and insulin-regulated glucose production and glucose incorporation into glycogen. In addition, we extended our investigation to other hepatic functions such as lipid synthesis and amino acid transport, which could not be studied in vivo. Although glucose production from glycogenolysis or  in absence or presence of glucagon was identical in the two cell populations, glucagon-stimulated glycogenolysis was more sensitive to insulin action in diabetic hepatocytes. Similarly, insulin action on glucose incorporation into glycogen, lipogenesis, and amino acid transport were enhanced in diabetic hepatocytes. The hormone effect was manifested by an increase in the sensitivity and/or in the responsiveness, reflecting the multiplicity of the pathways whereby the insulin signal is transduced through the insulin receptor to multiple postreceptor sites. To gain insight into the possible mechanism of these disturbances, we evaluated the initial insulin receptor interaction and the kinase activity of the receptor beta-subunit. In accordance with our previous study on intact livers, we found no alteration in either of these parameters in n0-STZ rat hepatocytes. Thus, the present study clearly demonstrates that these diabetic rats exhibit a postreceptor hyperresponsiveness to insulin at the cellular level. It strengthens the notion that a beta-cell deficiency with glucose intolerance does not necessarily lead to a hepatic insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20085730>Clking on PGC-1alpha to inhibit .</a></h2><p>The link between Akt activation and gluconeogenic repression remains unclear, despite many years of investigation and remarkable progress.

Metabonomics and chemical profile were integrated in combination with the multivariate statistical analysis (MVA) to discover the chemical constituents which contribute to the antidepressant effect of CSGS. Based upon the difference between CSGS and QZ (CSGS without Zhi-Qiao) extracts in the chemical profiles and the regulations of metabolic disturbances induced by CUMS, synephrine, naringin, hesperidin, and neohesperidin were recognized as the active constituents of CSGS from Zhi-qiao responsible for those missing regulations of CSGS when Zhi-Qiao was subtracted from the whole formula. They participated in the regulations of the deviated metabolites 2-4, 10-14, and 22-25, involved in metabolic pathways of ketone bodies synthesis, phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis, valine, aspartate, glutamate metabolism, and glycolysis/. Furthermore, the assay of MAO-A activity confirmed the potential antidepressant effect of naringin and its active sites on the MAO-A was inferred by molecular docking study.

The objective of this study was to characterize the species composition as well as functional potential of the bacteriome associated with OSCC. DNA obtained from 20 fresh OSCC biopsies (cases) and 20 deep-epithelium swabs (matched control subjects) was sequenced for the V1-V3 region using Illumina's 2 × 300 bp chemistry. High quality, non-chimeric merged reads were classified to species level using a prioritized BLASTN-algorithm. Downstream analyses were performed using QIIME, PICRUSt, and LEfSe. Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum was the most significantly overrepresented species in the tumors followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Campylobacter sp. Oral taxon 44, while Streptococcus mitis, Rothia mucilaginosa and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were the most significantly abundant in the controls. Functional prediction showed that genes involved in bacterial mobility, flagellar assembly, bacterial chemotaxis and LPS synthesis were enriched in the tumors while those responsible for DNA repair and combination, purine metabolism, phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis, ribosome biogenesis and glycolysis/ were significantly associated with the controls. This is the first epidemiological evidence for association of F. nucleatum and P. aeruginosa with OSCC.

Numerous studies give evidence that chromium picolinate can modulate blood glucose and insulin resistance. The main ingredient of Tianmai Xiaoke (TMXK) Tablet is chromium picolinate. In China, TMXK Tablet is used to treat type 2 diabetes. This study investigated the effect of TMXK on glucose metabolism in diabetic rats to explore possible underlying molecular mechanisms for its action.Diabetes was induced in rats by feeding a high-fat diet and subcutaneously injection with a single dose of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg, tail vein). One week after streptozotocin-injection, model rats were divided into diabetic group, low dose of TMXK group and high dose of TMXK group. Eight normal rats were used as normal control. After 8 weeks of treatment, skeletal muscle was obtained and was analyzed using Roche NimbleGen mRNA array and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Fasting blood glucose, oral glucose tolerance test and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index were also measured.The authors found that the administration of TMXK Tablet can reduce the fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin level and HOMA-IR index. The authors also found that 2 223 genes from skeletal muscle of the high-dose TMXK group had significant changes in expression (1 752 increased, 471 decreased). Based on Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis, the most three significant pathways were "insulin signaling pathway", "glycolysis/" and "citrate cycle (TCA)". qPCR showed that relative levels of forkhead box O3 (FoxO3), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (Pck2), and protein  phosphatase 1B (Ptp1b) were significantly decreased in the high-dose TMXK group, while v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (Akt1) and insulin receptor substrate 2 (Irs2) were increased.Our data show that TMXK Tablet reduces fasting glucose level and improves insulin resistance in diabetic rats.

We found that chronic leucine supplementation increased insulin sensitivity together with increased body weight in rats on HFD, but had no effect on insulin sensitivity in rats on normal chow diet. The increased insulin sensitivity by leucine supplementation was not associated with altered ectopic fat accumulation in liver and muscle, plasma levels of lipids and cytokines, but is associated with reduced oxidative stress and improved insulin signaling. Chronic leucine supplementation did not enhance insulin receptor substract-1 (IRS-1) phosphorylation on serine 302, but elevated basal IRS-1 phosphorylation on  632 and improved insulin-stimulated protein kinase B (Akt) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation in liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue of rats on HFD rats, indicating leucine supplementation prevented HFD-induced insulin resistance in insulin-target tissues.Chronic leucine supplementation can increase insulin sensitivity and body weight likely by reducing oxidative stress and improving insulin signaling pathway in rats on HFD.© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Cocoa has anti-diabetic effects by lowering glucose levels. However, whether cocoa exerts beneficial effects on the renal cortex glucose homeostasis and the molecular mechanisms responsible for this possible protective activity remain largely unknown. Thus, the potential anti-diabetic properties of cocoa on insulin signalling, glucose transporters and gluconeogenic enzymes were evaluated in the renal cortex of Zucker Diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Male ZDF rats were fed a control or cocoa-rich diet (10%), and Zucker Lean animals received the control diet. ZDF rats supplemented with cocoa (ZDF-Co) showed decreased body weight gain, glucose and insulin levels, improved glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and structural alterations in renal cortex. Moreover, cocoa-rich diet ameliorated insulin resistance by reverting decreased -phosphorylated-insulin receptor levels and by preventing the inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3/glycogen synthase pathway (GSK-3/GS) in the renal cortex of ZDF-Co rats. Cocoa antihyperglycaemic effect also appeared to be mediated through the diminution of phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase), sodium-glucose-co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2), and glucose-transporter-2 (GLUT-2) levels in ZDF-Co rat's renal cortex.

The functions of EETs in hepatocytes are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of 14,15-EETs treatment on the insulin signal transduction pathway in hepatocytes. We report that chronic treatment, not acute treatment, with 30 μM 14,15-EETs prevents palmitate induced insulin resistance and potentiates insulin action in cultured HepG2 hepatocytes. 14,15-EETs increase Akt phosphorylation at S473, activating Akt, in an insulin dependent manner in HepG2 cells. Under insulin resistant conditions induced by palmitate, 14,15-EETs restore the insulin response by increasing S473-phosphorylated Akt. 8,9-EETs and 11,12-EETs demonstrated similar effects to 14,15-EETs. Furthermore, 14,15-EETs potentiate insulin-suppression of  in cultured H4IIE hepatocytes. To elucidate the mechanism of EETs function, we analyzed the insulin signaling factors upstream of Akt. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) with LY294002 attenuated the 14,15-EETs-induced activating phosphorylation of Akt. 14,15-EETs reduced palmitate-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 on S312 and phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) at threonine 183 and  185 residues. The regulation of insulin sensitivity in cultured hepatocytes by chronic 14,15-EETs treatment appears to involve the JNK-IRS-PI3K pathway.

Its function is primarily controlled by the anabolic hormone insulin and its counterparts glucagon, catecholamines and glucocorticoids. Dysregulation of this homeostatic system is a major cause for development of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The features of the underlying dynamic molecular network that coordinates systemic nutrient homeostasis are less clear. But recently, considerable progress has been made in elucidating molecular pathways and potential factors involved in the regulation of energy and lipid metabolism and affected in diabetic states. In this review we will focus on important stations in the complex network of molecules that control the balance between glucose production, glucose utilization and regulation of lipid metabolism. Special attention will be paid to the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins with the two major isoforms IRS-1 and IRS-2 as a critical node in hepatic insulin signalling. IRS proteins act as docking molecules to connect  kinase receptor activation to essential downstream kinase cascades, including activation of the PI-3 kinase or MAPK cascade. IRS-1 and IRS-2 are complementary key players in the regulation of hepatic insulin signalling and expression of genes involved in , glycogen synthesis and lipid metabolism. The function of IRS proteins is regulated by their expression levels and posttranslational modifications. This regulation within the dynamic molecular network that coordinates systemic nutrient homeostasis will be outlined in detail under the following conditions: after feeding, during fasting and during exercise. Dysfunction of IRS proteins initially leads to post-prandial hyperglycemia, increased hepatic glucose production, and dysregulated lipid synthesis and is discussed as major pathophysiological mechanism for the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Understanding the molecular regulation and the pathophysiological modifications of IRS proteins is crucial in order to identify new sites for potential intervention to treat or prevent hepatic insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934933>Comparative Analysis of the Liver Transcriptome among Cattle Breeds Using RNA-seq.</a></h2><p>Global gene expression in liver transcriptome varies among cattle breeds. The present investigation was aimed to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), metabolic gene networks and metabolic pathways in bovine liver transcriptome of young bulls. In this study, we comparatively analyzed the bovine liver transcriptome of dairy (Polish Holstein Friesian (HF);  = 6), beef (Hereford;  = 6), and dual purpose (Polish-Red;  = 6) cattle breeds. This study identified 895, 338, and 571 significant ( < 0.01) differentially expressed (DE) gene-transcripts represented as 745, 265, and 498 hepatic DE genes through the Polish-Red versus Hereford, Polish-HF versus Hereford, and Polish-HF versus Polish-Red breeds comparisons, respectively. By combining all breeds comparisons, 75 hepatic DE genes ( < 0.01) were identified as commonly shared among all the three breed comparisons; 70, 160, and 38 hepatic DE genes were commonly shared between the following comparisons: (i) Polish-Red versus Hereford and Polish-HF versus Hereford; (ii) Polish-Red versus Hereford and Polish-HF versus Polish-Red; and (iii) Polish-HF versus Hereford and Polish-HF versus Polish-Red, respectively. A total of 440, 82, and 225 hepatic DE genes were uniquely observed for the Polish-Red versus Hereford, Polish-HF versus Hereford, and Polish-Red versus Polish-HF comparisons, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) analysis identified top-ranked enriched GO terms ( < 0.01) including 17, 16, and 31 functional groups and 151, 61, and 140 gene functions that were DE in all three breed liver transcriptome comparisons. Gene network analysis identified several potential metabolic pathways involved in glutamine family amino-acid, triglyceride synthesis, , p38MAPK cascade regulation, cholesterol biosynthesis (Polish-Red versus Hereford); IGF-receptor signaling, catecholamine transport, lipoprotein lipase,  kinase binding receptor (Polish-HF versus Hereford), and PGF-receptor binding, (Polish-HF versus Polish-Red). Validation results showed that the relative expression values were consistent to those obtained by RNA-seq, and significantly correlated between the quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and RNA-seq (Pearson's r  > 0.90).

However, the molecular mechanism regulating IRTK activity in the liver remains poorly understood. Here, we show that phosphoinositide 3-kinase enhancer A (PIKE-A) is a new insulin-dependent enhancer of hepatic IRTK. Liver-specific Pike-knockout (LPKO) mice display glucose intolerance with impaired hepatic insulin sensitivity. Specifically, insulin-provoked phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signalling is diminished in the liver of LPKO mice, leading to the failure of insulin-suppressed  and hyperglycaemia.

Its clinical efficacy requires the presence of insulin and involves several therapeutic effects. Of these effects, some are mediated via increased insulin action, and some are not directly insulin dependent. Metformin acts on the liver to suppress  mainly by potentiating the effect of insulin, reducing hepatic extraction of certain substrates (e.g. lactate) and opposing the effects of glucagon. In addition, metformin can reduce the overall rate of glycogenolysis and decrease the activity of hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into skeletal muscle is enhanced by metformin. This has been attributed in part to increased movement of insulin-sensitive glucose transporters into the cell membrane. Metformin also appears to increase the functional properties of insulin- and glucose-sensitive transporters. The increased cellular uptake of glucose is associated with increased glycogen synthase activity and glycogen storage. Other effects involved in the blood glucose-lowering effect of metformin include an insulin-independent suppression of fatty acid oxidation and a reduction in hypertriglyceridaemia. These effects reduce the energy supply for  and serve to balance the glucose-fatty acid (Randle) cycle. Increased glucose turnover, particularly in the splanchnic bed, may also contribute to the blood glucose-lowering capability of metformin. Metformin improves insulin sensitivity by increasing insulin-mediated insulin receptor  kinase activity, which activates post-receptor insulin signalling pathways. Some other effects of metformin may result from changes in membrane fluidity in hyperglycaemic states. Metformin therefore improves hepatic and peripheral sensitivity to insulin, with both direct and indirect effects on liver and muscle. It also exerts effects that are independent of insulin but cannot substitute for this hormone. These effects collectively reduce insulin resistance and glucotoxicity in type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17078986>Blood concentrations of amino acids, glucose and lactate during experimental swine dysentery.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to examine blood concentrations of amino acids, glucose and lactate in association with experimental swine dysentery. Ten pigs (approximately 23kg) were orally inoculated with Brachyspira hyodysenteriae. Eight animals developed muco-haemorrhagic diarrhoea with impaired general appearance, changes in white blood cell counts and increased levels of the acute phase protein Serum Amyolid A. Blood samples were taken before inoculation, during the incubation period, during clinical signs of dysentery and during recovery. Neither plasma glucose nor lactate concentrations changed during the course of swine dysentery, but the serum concentrations of gluconeogenic non-essential amino acids decreased during dysentery. This was mainly due to decreases in alanine, glutamine, serine and . Lysine increased during dysentery and at the beginning of the recovery period, and leucine increased during recovery. Glutamine, alanine and  levels show negative correlations with the numbers of neutrophils and monocytes. In conclusion, swine dysentery altered the blood concentrations of amino acids, but not of glucose or lactate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15698539>Selective glucocorticoid receptor nonsteroidal ligands completely antagonize the dexamethasone mediated induction of enzymes involved in  and glutamine metabolism.</a></h2><p>Glucocorticoids (GCs) are vital multi-faceted hormones with recognized effects on carbohydrate, protein and lipid metabolism.

In this study, the modulation of insulin signalling by EC and a cocoa phenolic extract (CPE) on hepatic HepG2 cells was investigated by analysing key proteins of the insulin pathways, namely insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1 and 2, PI3K/AKT and 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), as well as the levels of the glucose transporter GLUT-2 and the hepatic glucose production.EC and CPE enhanced the  phosphorylation and total insulin receptor, IRS-1 and IRS-2 levels and activated the PI3K/AKT pathway and AMPK in HepG2 cells. CPE also enhanced the levels of GLUT-2. Interestingly, EC and CPE modulated the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, a key protein involved in the , leading to a diminished glucose production.

Accordingly, genes for hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes exhibit daily expression rhythms, whose detailed regulations under nutritional variations remain elusive. As a first step, we performed general systematic characterization of daily expression profiles of gluconeogenic enzyme genes for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), cytosolic form (Pck1), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), catalytic subunit (G6pc), and  aminotransferase (TAT) (Tat) in the mouse liver. On a standard diet fed ad libitum, mRNA levels of these genes showed robust daily rhythms with a peak or an elevation phase during the late sleep-fasting period in the diurnal feeding/fasting (wake/sleep) cycle. The rhythmicity was preserved in constant darkness, modulated with prolonged fasting, attenuated by Clock mutation, and entrained to varied photoperiods and time-restricted feedings. These results are concordant with the notion that gluconeogenic enzyme genes are under the control of the intrinsic circadian oscillator, which is entrained by the light/dark cycle, and which in turn entrains the feeding/fasting cycle and also drives systemic signaling pathways such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. On the other hand, time-restricted feedings also showed that the ingestion schedule, when separated from the light/dark cycle, can serve as an independent entrainer to daily expression rhythms of gluconeogenic enzyme genes. Moreover, nutritional changes dramatically modified expression profiles of the genes. In addition to prolonged fasting, a high-fat diet and a high-carbohydrate (no-protein) diet caused modification of daily expression rhythms of the genes, with characteristic changes in profiles of glucoregulatory hormones such as corticosterone, glucagon, and insulin, as well as their modulators including ghrelin, leptin, resistin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Remarkably, high-protein (60% casein or soy-protein) diets activated the gluconeogenic enzyme genes atypically during the wake-feeding period, with paradoxical up-regulation of glucagon, which frequently formed correlation networks with other humoral factors. Based on these results, we propose that daily expression rhythms of gluconeogenic enzyme genes are under the control of systemic oscillator-driven and nutrient-responsive hormones.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11380073>The effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor on insulin signal transduction in the liver of diabetic mice.</a></h2><p>We previously reported that repeated subcutaneous or intracerebroventricular injection of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) reduces blood glucose concentrations in obese diabetic C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. In this study, we assessed the effects of BDNF on insulin action in peripheral tissues of diabetic mice.First, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (20 mg/kg) was subcutaneously given to male db/db mice for 14 days and then the insulin-stimulated  phosphorylation of insulin receptors and insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity in peripheral tissues was assessed. Second, we examined the effects of a single subcutaneous or intracerebroventricular brain-derived neurotrophic factor injection on insulin responsiveness in liver and skeletal muscle of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Third, the effects of brain-derived neurothrophic factor on insulin action were also examined in cultured cells.Repeated injection of BDNF to db/db mice for 14 days enhanced insulin-stimulated  phosphorylation of insulin receptors in liver and insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity in liver, skeletal muscle and interscapular brown adipose tissue. We then examined the rapid effect of BDNF on insulin signalling in vivo. A single subcutaneous or intracerebroventricular injection of BDNF rapidly increased insulin-stimulated  phosphorylation of insulin receptors and PI 3-kinase activity in liver of STZ-mice. No direct effect of brain-derived neurothrophic factor was observed on insulin signalling in primary cultured hepatocytes, L6 muscle cells or 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Brain-derived neurothrophic factor did not affect either glucose uptake or  in these cells.These data indicate that brain-derived neurothrophic factor rapidly enhances insulin signal transduction in liver and shows hypoglycaemic action in diabetic mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28861402> Tick Cells Control  Infection by Increasing the Synthesis of Phosphoenolpyruvate from .</a></h2><p>The obligate intracellular pathogen, , is the causative agent of life-threatening diseases in humans and animals.  is an emerging tick-borne pathogen in the United States, Europe, Africa and Asia, with increasing numbers of infected people and animals every year. It is increasingly recognized that intracellular pathogens modify host cell metabolic pathways to increase infection and transmission in both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Recent reports have shown that amino acids are central to the host-pathogen metabolic interaction. In this study, a genome-wide search for components of amino acid metabolic pathways was performed in , the main tick vector of  in the United States, for which the genome was recently published. The enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation pathways of the twenty amino acids were identified. Then, the available transcriptomics and proteomics data was used to characterize the mRNA and protein levels of  amino acid metabolic pathway components in response to  infection of tick tissues and ISE6 tick cells. Our analysis was focused on the interplay between carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism during  infection in ISE6 cells. The results showed that tick cells increase the synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) from  to control  infection. Metabolic pathway analysis suggested that this is achieved by (i) increasing the transcript and protein levels of mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-M), (ii) shunting  into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to increase fumarate and oxaloacetate which will be converted into PEP by PEPCK-M, and (iii) blocking all the pathways that use PEP downstream  (i.e.,  serine synthesis pathway (SSP), glyceroneogenesis and ).

Pre-treatment with propranolol (β-adrenergic receptor antagonist) and phentolamine (α-adrenergic receptor antagonist) were effective in abrogating monocrotophos-induced hyperglycemia. Interestingly, while propranolol offered partial protection against hyperglycemia, phentolamine completely abolished the same. However, monocrotophos-induced hyperlactacidemia was completely abolished by propranolol. Both the adrenoreceptor antagonists, however, failed to attenuate the stressogenic potential of monocrotophos. Hyperglycemia and hyperlactacidemia induced by monocrotophos were abolished by pre-treatment with atropine. Exogenous epinephrine was associated with hyperglycemia and hyperlactacidemia. The impact of adrenergic antagonists on epinephrine-induced hyperglycemia and hyperlactacidemia were remarkably similar to that of monocrotophos-induced hyperglycemia and hyperlactacidemia. Further, hydrazine sulfate (a  inhibitor) abolished hyperglycemia in monocrotophos-treated rats. From our data, it can be hypothesized that excessive stimulation of adrenoreceptors, probably elicited by increased plasma epinephrine, mediates hyperglycemic outcomes induced by monocrotophos. Pattern of changes in plasma lactate suggests that β-adrenergic activation mediates monocrotophos-induced hyperlactacidemia, while α-adrenergic receptor mediates lactate utilization, leading to hyperglycemia. Induction of liver TAT activity is attributable to glucocorticoid receptor activation as a result of hypercorticosteronemia.Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Based on these results, we have explored the molecular mechanisms underlying circadian oscillation and phase response to light of the master clock located in the dorsomedial subdivision of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and found various proteins closely related to phase response such as BIT/SHPS-1 and those of circadian oscillation, some of which are involved in protein- phosphorylation.On the other hand, we have presented several lines of evidence that the ventrolateral subdivision of the SCN includes not only the control center of energy supply to the brain, but also that of homeostasis such as blood glucose, blood pressure, water balance, and body temperature. We have also shown that besides these functions, the latter subdivision is involved in the regulations of hormone secretions such as insulin, glucagon, corticosterone and vasopressin. It has been also shown by electrophysiological means that light exposure to rat eye enhances sympathetic nerve activity, whereas it depresses parasympathetic nerve activity. Thus, environmental light is implicated not only in the phase-shift through the retinohypthalamic tract (RHT), but also control of autonomic nerve activities through the RHT, It is also discussed in this review how the two divisions are interconnected and how environmental light is involved in this interconnection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27126605>Nutritional mitigation of winter thermal stress in gilthead seabream: Associated metabolic pathways and potential indicators of nutritional state.</a></h2><p>A trial was carried out with gilthead seabream juveniles, aiming to investigate the ability of an enhanced dietary formulation (diet Winter Feed, WF, containing a higher proportion of marine-derived protein sources and supplemented in phospholipids, vitamin C, vitamin E and taurine) to assist fish in coping with winter thermal stress, compared to a low-cost commercial diet (diet CTRL). In order to identify the metabolic pathways affected by WF diet, a comparative two dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) analysis of fish liver proteome (pH 4–7) was undertaken at the end of winter. A total of 404 protein spots, out of 1637 detected, were differentially expressed between the two groups of fish. Mass spectrometry analysis of selected spots suggested that WF diet improved oxidative stress defense, reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress, enhanced metabolic flux through methionine cycle and phenylalanine/ catabolism, and induced higher aerobic metabolism and gluconeogenesis. Results support the notion that WF diet had a positive effect on fish nutritional state by partially counteracting the effect of thermal stress and underlined the sensitivity of proteome data for nutritional and metabolic profiling purposes. Intragroup variability and co-measured information were also used to pinpoint which proteins displayed a stronger relation with fish nutritional state.Winter low water temperature is a critical factor for gilthead seabream farming in the Mediterranean region, leading to a reduction of feed intake, which often results in metabolic and immunological disorders and stagnation of growth performances. In a recent trial, we investigated the ability of an enhanced dietary formulation (diet WF) to assist gilthead seabream in coping with winter thermal stress, compared to a standard commercial diet (diet CTRL). Within this context, in the present work, we identified metabolic processes that are involved in the stress-mitigating effect observed with diet WF, by undertaking a comparative analysis of fish liver proteome at the end of winter. This study brings information relative to biological processes that are involved in gilthead seabream winter thermal stress and shows that these can be mitigated through a nutritional strategy, assisting gilthead seabream to deal better with winter thermal conditions. Furthermore, the results show that proteomic information not only clearly distinguishes the two dietary groups from each other, but also captures heterogeneities that reflect intra-group differences in nutritional state. This was exploited in this work to refine the variable selection strategy so that protein spots displaying a stronger correlation with “nutritional state” could be identified as possible indicators of gilthead seabream metabolic and nutritional state. Finally, this study shows that gel-based proteomics seems to provide more reliable information than transmissive FT-IR spectroscopy, for the purposes of nutritional and metabolic profiling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1532777>Pathogenesis of NIDDM. A balanced overview.</a></h2><p>Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) results from an imbalance between insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. Both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that the earliest detectable abnormality in NIDDM is an impairment in the body's ability to respond to insulin. Because the pancreas is able to appropriately augment its secretion of insulin to offset the insulin resistance, glucose tolerance remains normal. With time, however, the beta-cell fails to maintain its high rate of insulin secretion and the relative insulinopenia (i.e., relative to the degree of insulin resistance) leads to the development of impaired glucose tolerance and eventually overt diabetes mellitus. The cause of pancreatic "exhaustion" remains unknown but may be related to the effect of glucose toxicity in a genetically predisposed beta-cell. Information concerning the loss of first-phase insulin secretion, altered pulsatility of insulin release, and enhanced proinsulin-insulin secretory ratio is discussed as it pertains to altered beta-cell function in NIDDM. Insulin resistance in NIDDM involves both hepatic and peripheral, muscle, tissues. In the postabsorptive state hepatic glucose output is normal or increased, despite the presence of fasting hyperinsulinemia, whereas the efficiency of tissue glucose uptake is reduced. In response to both endogenously secreted or exogenously administered insulin, hepatic glucose production fails to suppress normally and muscle glucose uptake is diminished. The accelerated rate of hepatic glucose output is due entirely to augmented . In muscle many cellular defects in insulin action have been described including impaired insulin-receptor  kinase activity, diminished glucose transport, and reduced glycogen synthase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. The abnormalities account for disturbances in the two major intracellular pathways of glucose disposal, glycogen synthesis, and glucose oxidation. In the earliest stages of NIDDM, the major defect involves the inability of insulin to promote glucose uptake and storage as glycogen. Other potential mechanisms that have been put forward to explain the insulin resistance, include increased lipid oxidation, altered skeletal muscle capillary density/fiber type/blood flow, impaired insulin transport across the vascular endothelium, increased amylin, calcitonin gene-related peptide levels, and glucose toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9319410>Metabolic effects of cortisol treatment in a marine teleost, the sea raven</a></h2><p>Sea raven (Hemitripterus americanus) given intraperitoneal implants of coconut oil containing cortisol (50 mg kg-1) and sampled 5 days later had plasma cortisol, glucose and urea concentrations higher than in a sham-implanted group. No differences in plasma ammonia, free amino acid or fatty acid concentrations were apparent between the cortisol- and sham-treated groups. There was no change in hepatic glycogen content, whereas glutamine synthetase, allantoicase, arginase, aspartate aminotransferase,  aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase activities were higher in the cortisol-treated fish liver compared with the sham-implanted fish. On the basis of these general increases in enzyme activities, our results suggest that cortisol stimulates nitrogen metabolism in the sea raven. Amino acid catabolism may be a major source of substrate for  and/or oxidation, while fatty acid mobilization may provide the fuel for endogenous use by the liver in cortisol-treated sea raven. These results further support the hypothesis that cortisol plays a role in the regulation of glucose production in stressed fish.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14576184>Cell-specific pituitary gene expression profiles after treatment with leukemia inhibitory factor reveal novel modulators for proopiomelanocortin expression.</a></h2><p>Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) mediates the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal stress response. Transgenic mice overexpressing LIF in the developing pituitary have altered pituitary differentiation with expansion of corticotropes, maintenance of Rathke's cleft cysts, and suppression of all other pituitary cell types. Affymetrix GeneChips were used to identify modulators of LIF effects in corticotrope (AtT-20) and somatolactotrope (GH(3)) cells. In addition to genes known to respond to LIF in corticotrope cells [e.g. suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3), signal transducer and activator of transcription-3, SH2 domain-containing  phosphatase-1, and proopiomelanocortin (POMC)], corticotrope-specific changes were also observed for genes involved in glycolysis and , transcription factors, signaling molecules, and expressed sequence tags. Two transcription factors identified, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-inducible factor (GIF), dose-dependently induced expression of the rat POMC promoter when overexpressed in AtT-20 cells. LIF further induced POMC transcription with C/EBPbeta, but not with GIF. C/EBPbeta also induced expression of the SOCS-3 promoter that was further enhanced by cotreatment with LIF. However, GIF did not affect SOCS-3 expression. These results indicate that C/EBPbeta and GIF are downstream effectors of LIF corticotrope action. LIF also stimulates the expression of inhibitors of its actions, such as SOCS-3 and SH2 domain-containing  phosphatase-1. alpha(2)-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG)/fetuin, a secreted protein that antagonizes bone TGFbeta/bone morphogenic protein signaling, was induced by LIF in a signal transducer and activator of transcription-3-dependent fashion. Pretreatment with AHSG/fetuin blocked LIF-induced expression of the POMC promoter independently of SOCS-3. Thus, using GeneChips, C/EBPbeta and GIF have been identified as novel mediators and AHSG/fetuin as an inhibitor of LIF action in corticotropes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23463119>Diabetes and infections-hepatitis C: is there type 2 diabetes excess in hepatitis C infection?</a></h2><p>Individual epidemiologic studies as well as the pooled analysis of observational studies have indicated the association between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hepatitis C virus infection (HCV). Whether HCV infection is the cause of diabetes or diabetic patients are more prone to get HCV infection is still in question. The objective of the present review was to provide answers to this issue, based on available evidence from epidemiologic, molecular, experimental and therapeutic studies. Our current understanding of how chronic HCV infection could induce T2D is incomplete, but it seems twofold based on both direct and indirect roles of the virus. HCV may directly induce insulin resistance (IR) through its proteins. HCV core protein was shown to stimulate suppressor of cytokine signaling, resulting in ubiquitination and degradation of  kinase phosphorylated insulin receptor substrates (IRS1/2) in proteasomes. HCV-nonstructural protein could increase protein phosphatase 2A which has been shown to inactivate the key enzyme Akt by dephosphorylating it. Insulin signaling defects in hepatic IRS-1  phosphorylation and PI3-kinase association/activation may contribute to IR, which leads to the development of T2D in patients with HCV infection. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are also implicated. PPARα/γ, together with their obligate partner RXR, are the main nuclear receptors expressed in the liver. PPARα upregulates glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycerol kinase, and glycerol transport proteins, which allows for glucose synthesis during fasting states. Decreased activity of PPARs could attribute to HCV-induced IR. Immune-mediated mechanisms may be involved in the indirect role of HCV in inducing IR. It is speculated that TNF-alpha plays a major role in the pathogenesis of IR through lowering IRS1/2. Furthermore, HCV infection- triggered ER stress could lead to the activation of PP2A, which inhibits both Akt and the AMP-activated kinase, the regulators of . In summary, we illustrate that HCV infection is accompanied by multiple defects in the upstream insulin signaling pathway in the liver that may contribute to the observed prevalence of IR and diabetes. Future studies are needed to resolve this issue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8700908>Prevention of diabetic alterations in transgenic mice overexpressing Myc in the liver.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that the overexpression of the c-myc gene in the liver of transgenic mice leads to an increase in both utilization and accumulation of glucose in the liver, suggesting that c-Myc transcription factor is involved in the control of liver carbohydrate metabolism in vivo. To determine whether the increase in c-Myc might control glucose homeostasis, an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed. Transgenic mice showed lower levels of blood glucose than control animals, indicating that the overexpression of c-Myc led to an increase of blood glucose disposal by the liver. Thus, the increase in c-Myc might counteract diabetic hyperglycemia. In contrast to control mice, transgenic mice treated with streptozotocin showed normalization of concentrations of blood glucose, ketone bodies, triacylglycerols and free fatty acids in the absence of insulin. These findings resulted from the normalization of liver metabolism in these animals. While low glucokinase activity was detected in the liver of diabetic control mice, high levels of both glucokinase mRNA and enzyme activity were noted in the liver of streptozotocin-treated transgenic mice, which led to an increase in intracellular levels of glucose 6-phosphate and glycogen. The liver of these mice also showed an increase in pyruvate kinase activity and lactate production. Furthermore, normalization of both the expression of genes involved in the control of  and ketogenesis and the production of glucose and ketone bodies was observed in streptozotocin-treated transgenic mice. Thus, these results suggested that c-Myc counteracted diabetic alterations through its ability to induce hepatic glucose uptake and utilization and to block the activation of  and ketogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12941762>Molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance in IRS-2-deficient hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>To assess the role of insulin receptor (IR) substrate (IRS)-2 in insulin action and resistance in the liver, immortalized neonatal hepatocyte cell lines have been generated from IRS-2(-/-), IRS-2(+/-), and wild-type mice. These cells maintained the expression of the differentiated liver markers albumin and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, as well as bear a high number of IRs. The lack of IRS-2 did not result in enhanced IRS-1  phosphorylation or IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity on insulin stimulation. Total insulin-induced PI 3-kinase activity was decreased by 50% in IRS-2(-/-) hepatocytes, but the translocation of PI-3,4,5-trisphosphate to the plasma membrane in these cells was almost completely abolished. Downstream PI 3-kinase, activation of Akt, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 (alpha and beta isoforms), Foxo1, and atypical protein kinase C were blunted in insulin-stimulated IRS-2(-/-) cells. Reconstitution of IRS-2(-/-) hepatocytes with adenoviral IRS-2 restored activation of these pathways, demonstrating that IRS-2 is essential for functional insulin signaling in hepatocytes. Insulin induced a marked glycogen synthase activity in wild-type and heterozygous primary hepatocytes; interestingly, this response was absent in IRS-2(-/-) cells but was rescued by infection with adenoviral IRS-2. Regarding , the induction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase by dibutyryl cAMP and dexamethasone was observed in primary hepatocytes of all genotypes. However, insulin was not able to suppress gluconeogenic gene expression in primary hepatocytes lacking IRS-2, but when IRS-2 signaling was reconstituted, these cells recovered this response to insulin. Suppression of gluconeogenic gene expression in IRS-2-deficient primary hepatocytes was also restored by infection with dominant negative Delta 256Foxo1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448714>Systemic and characteristic metabolites in the serum of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats at different stages as revealed by a (1)H-NMR based metabonomic approach.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus is a typical heterogeneous metabolic disorder characterized by abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Investigating the changes in metabolic pathways during the evolution of diabetes mellitus may contribute to the understanding of its metabolic features and pathogenesis. In this study, serum samples were collected from diabetic rats and age-matched controls at different time points: 1 and 9 weeks after streptozotocin (STZ) treatment. (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR)-based metabonomics with quantitative analysis was performed to study the metabolic changes. The serum samples were also subjected to clinical chemistry analysis to verify the metabolic changes observed by metabonomics. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) demonstrated that the levels of serum metabolites in diabetic rats are different from those in control rats. These findings indicate that the metabolic characteristics of the two groups are markedly different at 1 and 9 weeks. Quantitative analysis showed that the levels of some metabolites, such as pyruvate, lactate, citrate, acetone, acetoacetate, acetate, glycerol, and valine, varied in a time-dependent manner in diabetic rats. These results suggest that serum metabolites related to glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, , fatty acid β-oxidation, branched-chain amino acid metabolism, and the  metabolic pathways are involved in the evolution of diabetes. The metabolic changes represent potential features and promote a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the development of diabetes mellitus. This work further suggests that (1)H NMR metabonomics is a valuable approach for providing novel insights into the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and its complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17488287>A GAPDH mutant defective in Src-dependent  phosphorylation impedes Rab2-mediated events.</a></h2><p>Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) has multiple intracellular activities in addition to its role in . Indeed, we have reported that GAPDH is required for Rab2-mediated retrograde transport from vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs). These diverse GAPDH activities are the result of posttranslational modifications that confer a new function to the enzyme. In that regard, GAPDH is  phosphorylated by Src. To establish the functional significance of this modification for GAPDH activity in Rab2-dependent events, an amino acid substitution was made at  41 (GAPDH Y41F). The inability of Src to phosphorylate purified recombinant GAPDH Y41F was confirmed in an in vitro kinase assay. The mutant was then employed in a quantitative membrane-binding assay that measures Rab2 recruitment of soluble components to VTCs. As we observed with GAPDH wild type, Rab2 promoted GAPDH Y41F binding to membranes in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that GAPDH  phosphorylation is not required for VTC association. However, GAPDH was  phosphorylated on VTCs. Importantly, GAPDH Y41F blocked vesicular stomatitis virus-G transport in an assay that reconstitutes endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi trafficking, indicating that phosphorylation of  41 is essential for GAPDH activity in the early secretory pathway. The block in transport is because of the decreased binding of atypical protein kinase C iota/lambda to GAPDH Y41F, which reduces beta-coat protein association with the VTC and subsequent formation of Rab2-mediated retrograde vesicles. Our results suggest that Src plays a pivotal role in regulating the interaction of Rab2 effectors on the VTC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2902627>Coordinate regulation of two genes encoding gluconeogenic enzymes by the trans-dominant locus Tse-1.</a></h2><p>Tissue-specific extinguisher-1 (Tse-1) is a mouse genetic locus that can repress liver-specific  aminotransferase gene expression in trans. To search for other Tse-1-responsive genes, hepatoma microcell hybrids retaining mouse chromosome 11 or human chromosome 17, containing murine Tse-1 and human TSE1, respectively, were screened for expression of liver-specific mRNAs. While most liver gene activity was unaffected in such hybrids, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and  aminotransferase gene expression was coordinately repressed in these clones. Extinction of both genes was apparently mediated by a single genetic locus that resides on human chromosome 17.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1644288>Deficiency of an enzyme of  metabolism underlies altered gene expression in newborn liver of lethal albino mice.</a></h2><p>Mice homozygous for albino deletions encompassing the locus alf/hsdr-1 die shortly after birth. Lethality is thought to be the consequence of hypoglycemia, which results from the failure to activate hormone-dependent genes in liver and kidney encoding enzymes important for . Within the region in which alf/hsdr-1 has been defined by physical mapping, we identified the gene encoding fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), an enzyme of  metabolism. Lack of FAH activity should lead to accumulation of toxic  metabolites. In man, genetically determined FAH deficiency is the primary defect in tyrosinemia type I, a fatal liver disease of infants. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of mouse tissues showed that the cell types that normally express FAH correspond to those that exhibit a phenotype in alf/hsdr-1 deletion mice. Moreover, we could mimic aspects of the alf/hsdr-1 deletion phenotype in vitro by treating primary hepatocyte cultures with an intermediate of  metabolism. These findings strongly suggest that alf/hsdr-1 encodes FAH and that absence of FAH is responsible for neonatal lethality in albino deletion mice. Mechanisms by which this metabolic defect might bring about alterations in gene expression characteristic of the alf/hsdr-1 deletion phenotype are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29777991>Co-evolutionary associations between root-associated microbiomes and root transcriptomes in wild and cultivated rice varieties.</a></h2><p>The plants and root-associated microbiomes are closely related. Plant metabolic substances can serve as a nutrient source for the microbiome, and in return, the microbiome can regulate the production of plant metabolic substances. Wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), as the ancestor of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa), has changed several metabolic pathways and root-associated microbiome during evolution. Thus, the study of the different associations between metabolic pathways and root-associated microbiomes in wild and cultivated rice varieties is important for rice breeding. In this article, the co-evolutionary association between metabolic pathways, which are based on transcriptome data, and root-associated microbiomes, which are based on 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) amplicon data, in wild and cultivated rice was studied. The results showed that the enriched pathways were differentially correlated with the enriched microbiomes in wild and cultivated rice varieties. Pathways for 'Glutathione metabolism', 'Plant-pathogen interaction', 'Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum' and ' metabolism' were positively associated with the improved relative abundance of bacterial and fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in wild rice. On the other hand, 'Glycolysis/', 'Brassinosteroid biosynthesis', 'Carbon metabolism', 'Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis' and 'Caffeine metabolism' were positively correlated with the improved relative abundance of bacterial and fungal OTUs in cultivated rice. Redundancy analysis showed that certain bacterial and fungal species could positively and significantly affect plant gene expression; for instance, Streptomyces, with 8.7% relative abundance in bacterial community, significantly affected plant gene expression in wild rice. This study can provide the theoretical basis for recognizing the associations between root-associated microbiomes and root transcriptomes in wild and cultivated rice varieties, and can provide practical significance for developing useful bacterial and fungal resources in wild rice.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Although the clinical success of IM set a new paradigm in molecular-targeted therapy, the emergence of IM resistance is a clinically significant problem. In an effort to obtain new insights into the mechanisms of adaptation and tolerance to IM, as well as the signaling pathways potentially affected by this drug, we performed a two-dimensional electrophoresis-based quantitative- and phospho-proteomic analysis in the eukaryotic model Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We singled out proteins that were either differentially expressed or differentially phosphorylated in response to IM, using the phosphoselective dye Pro-Q(®) Diamond, and identified 18 proteins in total. Ten were altered only at the content level (mostly decreased), while the remaining 8 possessed IM-repressed phosphorylation. These 18 proteins are mainly involved in cellular carbohydrate processes (glycolysis/), translation, protein folding, ion homeostasis, and nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. Remarkably, all 18 proteins have human functional homologs. A role for HSP70 proteins in the response to IM, as well as decreased glycolysis as a metabolic marker of IM action are suggested, consistent with findings from studies in human cell lines. The previously-proposed effect of IM as an inhibitor of vacuolar H(+)-ATPase function was supported by the identification of an underexpressed protein subunit of this complex. Taken together, these findings reinforce the role of yeast as a valuable eukaryotic model for pharmacological studies and identification of new drug targets, with potential clinical implications in drug reassignment or line extension under a personalized medicine perspective.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15606684>Insulino-mimetic and anti-diabetic effects of vanadium compounds.</a></h2><p>Compounds of the trace element vanadium exert various insulin-like effects in in vitro and in vivo systems. These include their ability to improve glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance in animal models of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition to animal studies, several reports have documented improvements in liver and muscle insulin sensitivity in a limited number of patients with Type 2 diabetes. These effects are, however, not as dramatic as those observed in animal experiments, probably because lower doses of vanadium were used and the duration of therapy was short in human studies as compared with animal work. The ability of these compounds to stimulate glucose uptake, glycogen and lipid synthesis in muscle, adipose and hepatic tissues and to inhibit , and the activities of the gluconeogenic enzymes: phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase in the liver and kidney as well as lipolysis in fat cells contributes as potential mechanisms to their anti-diabetic insulin-like effects. At the cellular level, vanadium activates several key elements of the insulin signal transduction pathway, such as the  phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B activation. These pathways are believed to mediate the metabolic actions of insulin. Because protein  phosphatases (PTPases) are considered to be negative regulators of the insulin-signalling pathway, it is suggested that vanadium can enhance insulin signalling and action by virtue of its capacity to inhibit PTPase activity and increase  phosphorylation of substrate proteins. There are some concerns about the potential toxicity of available inorganic vanadium salts at higher doses and during long-term therapy. Therefore, new organo-vanadium compounds with higher potency and less toxicity need to be evaluated for their efficacy as potential treatment of human diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24954415>Hepatic oxidative stress promotes insulin-STAT-5 signaling and obesity by inactivating protein  phosphatase N2.</a></h2><p>Hepatic insulin resistance is a key contributor to the pathogenesis of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Paradoxically, the development of insulin resistance in the liver is not universal, but pathway selective, such that insulin fails to suppress  but promotes lipogenesis, contributing to the hyperglycemia, steatosis, and hypertriglyceridemia that underpin the deteriorating glucose control and microvascular complications in T2D. The molecular basis for the pathway-specific insulin resistance remains unknown. Here we report that oxidative stress accompanying obesity inactivates protein- phosphatases (PTPs) in the liver to activate select signaling pathways that exacerbate disease progression. In obese mice, hepatic PTPN2 (TCPTP) inactivation promoted lipogenesis and steatosis and insulin-STAT-5 signaling. The enhanced STAT-5 signaling increased hepatic IGF-1 production, which suppressed central growth hormone release and exacerbated the development of obesity and T2D. Our studies define a mechanism for the development of selective insulin resistance with wide-ranging implications for diseases characterized by oxidative stress.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In the acute phase of stroke (within 24h), rats with permanent cerebral ischemia developed higher fasting blood glucose and insulin levels in association with up-regulation of hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. In addition, hepatic -associated positive regulators, such as FoxO1, CAATT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs), and cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB), were up-regulated. For insulin signaling transduction, phosphorylation of insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) at the  residue, Akt, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), were attenuated in the liver, while negative regulators of insulin action, including phosphorylation of p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) at the serine residue, were increased. In addition, the brains of rats with stroke exhibited a reduction in phosphorylation of IRS1 at the  residue and Akt. Circulating cortisol, glucagon, C-reactive protein (CRP), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), and resistin levels were elevated, but adiponectin was reduced.

Disruption of the interplay between interleukin 6 (IL-6) and glucocorticoids (GCs), the peripheral mediators of inflammation and stress, respectively, may lead to side-effects associated with the pharmacological use of GCs. The current study investigated the interplay between IL-6 and GCs in a hepatoma cell line (BWTG3) at protein (protein activity assays, Western blotting, and ELISA) and mRNA (qPCR) levels. Specifically, the action of dexamethasone (Dex), a known antiinflammatory drug and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist, is compared to that of Compound A (CpdA), a selective glucocorticoid receptor agonist (SEGRA). CpdA, like IL-6, but unlike Dex, increases GR binding and decreases the metabolic enzymes,  aminotransferase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and gamma glutamyltransferase, at protein or mRNA level. Like Dex, both CpdA and IL-6 increase the positive APPs, serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein, and decrease the negative APP, corticosteroid binding globulin. The study shows that the GC, Dex, and IL-6 generally have divergent effects on the GR and metabolic enzymes, while their functions are convergent on the APPs. In contrast to Dex, CpdA has effects convergent to that of IL-6 on the GR, metabolic enzymes, and APPs. Thus these findings suggest that CpdA, like Dex, modulates APPs, leading to effective control of inflammation, while, in contrast to Dex, it is less likely to lead to GC-induced side-effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8103668>Perinatal activation of a  aminotransferase fusion gene does not occur in albino lethal mice.</a></h2><p>To investigate developmental expression of the rat  aminotransferase (TAT) gene in normal and in albino lethal mice we generated transgenic mice carrying a fusion gene of TAT 5'-sequences (11 kb) and the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene.

RNA analyses on a high-expressing line showed that transgenic expression follows expression of mouse TAT mRNA: it is inducible by glucocorticoids and activated perinatally. This perinatal activation of transgene expression does not occur in lethal albino mice (c14CoS/c14CoS) which are characterized by reduced mRNA levels of several liver-specific enzymes involved in . In conclusion, the data show that the 5'-flanking region of the rat TAT gene contains elements specifying regulated expression and establish that the 5'-flanking region of the TAT gene is responsive to the enzyme deficiency characteristic of the albino lethal mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9525995>Bidirectional modulation of insulin action by amino acids.</a></h2><p>Amino acids have been shown to stimulate protein synthesis, inhibit proteolysis, and decrease whole-body and forearm glucose disposal. Using cultured hepatoma and myotube cells, we demonstrate that amino acids act as novel signaling elements in insulin target tissues. Exposure of cells to high physiologic concentrations of amino acids activates intermediates important in the initiation of protein synthesis, including p70 S6 kinase and PHAS-I, in synergy with insulin. This stimulatory effect is largely due to branched chain amino acids, particularly leucine, and can be reproduced by its transamination product, ketoisocaproic acid. Concurrently, amino acids inhibit early steps in insulin action critical for glucose transport and inhibition of , including decreased insulin-stimulated  phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, decreased binding of grb 2 and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to IRS-1 and IRS-2, and a marked inhibition of insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that amino acids act as specific positive signals for maintenance of protein stores, while inhibiting other actions of insulin at multiple levels. This bidirectional modulation of insulin action indicates crosstalk between hormonal and nutritional signals and demonstrates a novel mechanism by which nutritional factors contribute to insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11597575>Inhibition of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene expression by troglitazone: a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma)-independent, antioxidant-related mechanism.</a></h2><p>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) is the rate-limiting enzyme of . Enhanced expression of the PEPCK gene in liver is present in most models of diabetes, and is thought to contribute to the increased hepatic glucose output seen in this disease. Recently, we showed that troglitazone, the first thiazolidinedione (TZD) used clinically, inhibits expression of the PEPCK gene in isolated hepatocytes. We have pursued the molecular mechanism whereby troglitazone exerts this inhibition. TZDs are known to bind and activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), a nuclear receptor, which regulates expression of target genes. Initially, we examined the abilities of three other TZDs (rosiglitazone, englitazone, and ciglitazone) to inhibit expression of the PEPCK gene. Despite the fact that these agents are ligands for PPARgamma, they displayed little if any inhibitory activity on the expression of this gene. GW1929 [N-(2-benzoyl phenyl)-], another potent PPARgamma ligand that is unrelated structurally to TZDs, had no inhibitory effect on PEPCK gene expression, while a natural PPARgamma ligand, the prostaglandin metabolite 15-PGJ2 (15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2), displayed only modest inhibitory activity. Treatment of hepatocytes with ligands for other isoforms of PPAR also had no significant effect on PEPCK gene expression. Troglitazone has an alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) moiety that is not present in other TZDs, and treatment of hepatocytes with vitamin E led to an inhibition of PEPCK gene expression. These observations support the conclusion that troglitazone inhibits the expression of the PEPCK gene by a PPARgamma-independent, antioxidant-related mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1439591>[The therapeutic effect of diazepam in dichlorvos poisoning].</a></h2><p>In order to study the influence of diazepam on both cholinergistic and non-cholinergistic (stressogenic) effects of phosphororganic insecticide dichlorovos, both the activity of cholinesterase in selected organs and blood as well as biochemical markers of stress (plasma corticosterone,  aminotransferase activity in the liver) have been applied. Comparing the course of diazepam-treated and untreated dichlorovos intoxication, cholinesterases showed greater increase in inhibition in the first case. There was smaller decrease in activity of acetylcholinesterase in CNS and diaphragm compared with untreated intoxication. Although the changes of plasma corticosterone level were entirely corresponding to those of untreated intoxication, there was still greater increase in activity of  aminotransferase when compared with untreated intoxication. A marked increase in activity of  aminotransferase is more convenient for an intoxicated organism, because  aminotransferase stimulates . Even in absence of a complete elimination of cholinergistic and stressogenic effects of dichlorovos, diazepam, as a drug, influenced markedly their course. Thus its significance of component of a complexive atropine-oxime therapy of the intoxication with organophosphates appears to be undiscussible and wider than stressed usually.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1601263>Metabolic actions of glucagon and dexamethasone in liver of the ureogenic teleost Opsanus beta.</a></h2><p>Injection with pharmacological doses of dexamethasone (5 mg/kg) and/or bovine glucagon (1 mg/kg) exerts pronounced effects on toadfish liver compared with vehicle-treated control fish. Affected parameters include hepatic levels of glycogen and the activities of glutamate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, malate dehydrogenase, and enzymes involved in NADPH generation as well as the kinetics of pyruvate kinase. Activities of  aminotransferase, however, a prime target for hormonal induction in mammals, remain unchanged in Opsanus. In subsequently isolated toadfish hepatocytes, metabolite concentrations and flux through  are altered as are in vitro responses to epinephrine and catfish glucagon in previously injected fish. Contrary to existing mammalian models, short-term regulation of urea cycle activity can be ruled out for toadfish, since hormone treatments fail to influence the activity of two ornithine-urea cycle enzymes or the rate of hepatocyte-urea synthesis. Treatment-dependent increases in hepatic glutamine synthetase, the unique feeder enzyme for ammonia "nitrogen" in fish urea cycle, indicate a potentially pivotal role for this enzyme in longer-term regulation of ureogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29027136>Oligonol promotes glucose uptake by modulating the insulin signaling pathway in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells via inhibiting protein  phosphatase 1B.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance and protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) overexpression are strongly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which is characterized by defects in insulin signaling and glucose intolerance. In a previous study, we demonstrated oligonol inhibits PTP1B and α-glucosidase related to T2DM. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-diabetic effects of oligonol in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. Glucose uptake was assessed using a fluorescent glucose tracer, 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxyglucose, and the signaling pathway was investigated by western blotting. Oligonol significantly increased insulin-provoked glucose uptake and decreased PTP1B expression, followed by modulation of ERK phosphorylation. In addition, oligonol activated insulin receptor substrate 1 by reducing phosphorylation at serine 307 and increasing that at  895, and enhanced the phosphorylations of Akt and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Interestingly, it also reduced the expression of two key enzymes of  (glucose 6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), attenuated oxidative stress by scavenging/inhibiting peroxynitrite, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and augmented the expression of nuclear factor kappa B. These findings suggest oligonol improved the insulin sensitivity of insulin-resistant HepG2 cells by attenuating the insulin signaling blockade and modulating glucose uptake and production. Furthermore, oligonol attenuated ROS-related inflammation and prevented oxidative damage in our in vitro model of type 2 diabetes. These result indicate oligonol has promising potential as a treatment for T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2819014>The influence of rumen volatile fatty acids on protein metabolism in growing lambs.</a></h2><p>The effect of acetic or propionic acid rumen fermentation patterns on whole-body protein turnover, tissue protein synthetic rates and body composition was investigated in growing lambs. Protein turnover was assessed using a continuous intravenous infusion of [2,3-3H] and tissue protein fractional synthetic rates (FSR) from the specific activities of plasma free, intracellular free and tissue bound . Only the FSR of muscle tissue approached significance. The high FSR in the propionic group was attributed to the high plasma insulin concentration. Values for whole-body protein synthesis, corrected for  oxidation, were similar to those obtained by summating protein synthesis in individual tissues, confirming that  oxidation should be measured accurately if reliable whole-body protein synthesis values are required.  oxidation and flux were high in the acetic acid group, suggesting that amino acids are used for . The high protein turnover rate probably ensures an adequate supply of gluconeogenic amino acids and that the penalty of mobilizing body proteins for gluconeogenic amino acids is minimal. In the propionic acid group, high plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were associated with a low protein turnover rate, high ratio of deposited: synthesized protein and a high body fat content. It is concluded that changing the proportion of ruminal volatile fatty acids influences protein turnover, protein synthesis and the efficiency of protein retention. Such factors probably contribute, indirectly, to the observed differences in body composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23341697>Maternal protein restriction induces alterations in insulin signaling and ATP sensitive potassium channel protein in hypothalami of intrauterine growth restriction fetal rats.</a></h2><p>It is well recognized that intrauterine growth restriction leads to the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus in adulthood. To investigate the mechanisms behind this "metabolic imprinting" phenomenon, we examined the impact of maternal undernutrition on insulin signaling pathway and the ATP sensitive potassium channel expression in the hypothalamus of intrauterine growth restriction fetus. Intrauterine growth restriction rat model was developed through maternal low protein diet. The expression and activated levels of insulin signaling molecules and K(ATP) protein in the hypothalami which were dissected at 20 days of gestation, were analyzed by western blot and real time PCR. The  phosphorylation levels of the insulin receptor substrate 2 and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase p85α in the hypothalami of intrauterine growth restriction fetus were markedly reduced. There was also a downregulation of the hypothalamic ATP sensitive potassium channel subunit, sulfonylurea receptor 1, which conveys the insulin signaling. Moreover, the abundances of  enzymes were increased in the intrauterine growth restriction livers, though no correlation was observed between sulfonylurea receptor 1 and  enzymes. Our data suggested that aberrant intrauterine milieu impaired insulin signaling in the hypothalamus, and these alterations early in life might contribute to the predisposition of the intrauterine growth restriction fetus toward the adult metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9727068>CCAAT enhancer- binding protein beta is required for normal hepatocyte proliferation in mice after partial hepatectomy.</a></h2><p>After two-thirds hepatectomy, normally quiescent liver cells are stimulated to reenter the cell cycle and proliferate to restore the original liver mass. The level of bZIP transcription factor CCAAT enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) increases in the liver during the period of cell proliferation. The significance of this change in C/EBP expression is not understood. To determine the role of C/EBPbeta in the regenerating liver, we examined the regenerative response after partial hepatectomy in mice that contain a targeted disruption of the C/EBPbeta gene. Posthepatectomy, hepatocyte DNA synthesis was decreased to 25% of normal in C/EBPbeta -/- mice. The reduced regenerative response was associated with a prolonged period of hypoglycemia that was independent of expression of C/EBPalpha protein and gluconeogenic genes. C/EBPbeta -/- livers showed reduced expression of immediate-early growth-control genes including the Egr-1 transcription factor, mitogen-activated protein kinase protein  phosphatase (MKP-1), and HRS, a delayed-early gene that encodes an mRNA splicing protein. Cyclin B and E gene expression were dramatically reduced in C/EBPbeta -/- livers whereas cyclin D1 expression was normal. The abnormalities in immediate-early gene expression in C/EBPbeta -/- livers were distinct from those seen in IL-6 -/- livers. These data link C/EBPbeta to the activation of metabolic and growth response pathways in the regenerating liver and demonstrate that C/EBPbeta is required for a normal proliferative response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25986657>Arachidonic acid impairs hypothalamic leptin signaling and hepatic energy homeostasis in mice.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological evidence suggests that the consumption of a diet high in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is associated with the development of leptin resistance and obesity. We aim to examine the central effect of n-6 PUFA, arachidonic acid (ARA) on leptin sensitivity and leptin-regulated hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. We found that intracerebroventricular injection of ARA (25 nmol/day) for 2.5 days reversed the effect of central leptin on hypothalamic JAK2, pSTAT3, pAkt, and pFOXO1 protein levels, which was concomitant with a pro-inflammatory response in the hypothalamus. ARA also attenuated the effect of central leptin on hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism by reversing the mRNA expression of the genes involved in  (G6Pase, PEPCK), glucose transportation (GLUT2), lipogenesis (FAS, SCD1), and cholesterol synthesis (HMG-CoA reductase). These results indicate that an increased exposure to central n-6 PUFA induces central cellular leptin resistance with concomitant defective JAK2-STAT3 and PI3K-Akt signaling.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Evidences indicate that (-)-epicatechin (EC) and colonic metabolites derived from flavonoid intake could possess antidiabetic effects, but the mechanisms for their preventive activities related to glucose homeostasis and insulin signalling in the kidney remain largely unknown. This work is aimed to investigate the effect of EC and main colonic phenolic acids derived from flavonoid intake, i.e. 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic-acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic-acid (DHPAA) and 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic-acid, on insulin signalling, and glucose production and uptake in renal tubular proximal NRK-52E cells treated with high glucose. Pre-treatment with EC or DHPAA prevented the decreased -phosphorylated and total levels of IR caused by high glucose. EC and DHPAA pre-treatment also avoided the inactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and AMPK, and the elevation of PEPCK levels induced by high glucose. Additionally, EC and DHPAA pre-treatment alleviated the altered glucose uptake and production caused by high glucose, although this protective effect was abrogated when AKT and AMPK were inhibited. These results suggest EC and DHPAA prevent or delay a potential dysfunction of NRK-52E cells treated with high glucose through the attenuation of the insulin signalling blockade and the modulation of glucose homeostasis via AKT and AMPK.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The mechanism by which hepatic STAT3 is regulated by nutritional or hormonal status has remained unknown, however. Here, we show that an increase in the plasma insulin concentration, achieved either by glucose administration or by intravenous insulin infusion, stimulates  phosphorylation of STAT3 in the liver. This effect of insulin was mediated by the hormone's effects in the brain, and the increase in hepatic IL-6 induced by the brain-insulin action is essential for the activation of STAT3. The inhibition of hepatic glucose production and of expression of gluconeogenic genes induced by intracerebral ventricular insulin infusion was impaired in mice with liver-specific STAT3 deficiency or in mice with IL-6 deficiency. These results thus indicate that IL-6-STAT3 signaling in the liver contributes to insulin action in the brain, leading to the suppression of hepatic glucose production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22124607>T cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP) deficiency in muscle does not alter insulin signalling and glucose homeostasis in mice.</a></h2><p>Insulin activates insulin receptor protein  kinase and downstream phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling in muscle to promote glucose uptake. The insulin receptor can serve as a substrate for the protein  phosphatase (PTP) 1B and T cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP), which share a striking 74% sequence identity in their catalytic domains. PTP1B is a validated therapeutic target for the alleviation of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. PTP1B dephosphorylates the insulin receptor in liver and muscle to regulate glucose homeostasis, whereas TCPTP regulates insulin receptor signalling and  in the liver. In this study we assessed for the first time the role of TCPTP in the regulation of insulin receptor signalling in muscle.We generated muscle-specific TCPTP-deficient (Mck-Cre;Ptpn2(lox/lox)) mice (Mck, also known as Ckm) and assessed the impact on glucose homeostasis and muscle insulin receptor signalling in chow-fed versus high-fat-fed mice.Blood glucose and insulin levels, insulin and glucose tolerance, and insulin-induced muscle insulin receptor activation and downstream PI3K/Akt signalling remained unaltered in chow-fed Mck-Cre;Ptpn2(lox/lox) versus Ptpn2(lox/lox) mice. In addition, body weight, adiposity, energy expenditure, insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis were not altered in high-fat-fed Mck-Cre;Ptpn2(lox/lox) versus Ptpn2(lox/lox) mice.These results indicate that TCPTP deficiency in muscle has no effect on insulin signalling and glucose homeostasis, and does not prevent high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance. Thus, despite their high degree of sequence identity, PTP1B and TCPTP contribute differentially to insulin receptor regulation in muscle. Our results are consistent with the notion that these two highly related PTPs make distinct contributions to insulin receptor regulation in different tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31065987>Comparison of metabolomic responses of earthworms to sub-lethal imidacloprid exposure in contact and soil tests.</a></h2><p>Eisenia fetida earthworms were exposed to sub-lethal levels of imidacloprid for 48 h via contact filter paper tests and soil tests. After the exposure, H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics was used to measure earthworm sub-lethal responses by analyzing the changes in the polar metabolite profile. Maltose, glucose, malate, lactate/threonine, myo-inositol, glutamate, arginine, lysine, , leucine, and phenylalanine relative concentrations were altered with imidacloprid exposure in soil. In addition to these metabolites (excluding leucine and phenylalanine), fumarate, ATP, inosine, betaine, scyllo-inositol, glutamine, valine, tryptophan, alanine, , and isoleucine relative concentrations shifted with imidacloprid exposure during contact tests. Metabolite changes in E. fetida earthworms exposed to imidacloprid showed a non-linear concentration response and an upregulation in . Overall, imidacloprid exposure in soil induces a less pronounced response in metabolites glucose, maltose, fumarate, adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP), inosine, scyllo-inositol, lactate/threonine, and  in comparison to the response observed via contact tests. Thus, our study highlights that tests in soil can result in a different metabolic response in E. fetida and demonstrates the importance of different modes of exposure and the extent of metabolic perturbation in earthworms. Our study also emphasizes the underlying metabolic disruption of earthworms after acute sub-lethal exposure to imidacloprid. These observations should be further examined in different soil types to assess the sub-lethal toxicity of imidacloprid to soil-dwelling earthworms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2863382>Complete complementary DNA of rat  aminotransferase messenger RNA.

Among peripheral tissues, the liver controls glucose homeostasis due to its ability to consume and produce glucose. The molecular mechanism underlying hepatic insulin resistance is not completely understood; however, it involves the impairment of the insulin signalling network. Among the critical nodes of hepatic insulin signalling, insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) and protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) modulate the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/Akt/Foxo1 pathway that controls the suppression of gluconeogenic genes. In this review, we will focus on recent findings regarding the molecular mechanism by which IRS2 and PTP1B elicit opposite effects on carbohydrate metabolism in the liver in response to insulin. Finally, we will discuss the involvement of the critical nodes of insulin signalling in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20966023>You deserve what you eat: lessons learned from the study of the melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-deficient mice.</a></h2><p>Diet plays a crucial role in the development of obesity and insulin resistance via multiple mechanisms. Saturated fatty acids can directly trigger tissue specific proinflammatory pathways via Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4)-dependent mechanisms. Moreover, diet can change the gut microbiome and increase gut permeability. However, very few studies have addressed the obesity-independent role of diet. Dissecting the effects of diet from those of obesity per se will enhance our understanding of the underlying pathogenesis, and, at the translational level, advance our treatment approaches for obesity and its co-morbidities.Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is an important regulator of appetite and energy balance. MCH-deficient mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity, primarily due to increased locomotor activity. We took advantage of the unique phenotype of these mice to examine the metabolic and inflammatory consequences of a 15-week consumption of a diet high in saturated fat.MCH-deficient mice chronically exposed to a high-fat diet gain less weight compared to their wild-type littermates, despite similar food intake, and are protected from hepatosteatosis. They also lack obesity-associated upregulation of serum leptin and insulin levels and have improved total body insulin sensitivity. Nevertheless, we found indistinguishable liver-specific innate immune responses in both genotypes associated with high-fat feeding, which involved activation of TLR4 and its downstream effectors, MyD88, p38 MAP kinase and STAT-3.Our findings indicate that high-fat feeding is deleterious to the liver, independently of the obesity status. They also suggest that MCH is not necessary for the TLR4-dependent immune response triggered by the high-fat diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10206484>Irreversibility of nutritionally induced NIDDM in Psammomys obesus is related to beta-cell apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Psammomys lapses into fully fledged diabetes when maintained on a high-energy diet. Progression to diabetes has been classified into stage A of normoglycemia and normoinsulinemia (<120 mg/ml and 100 mU/L, respectively); stage B of hyperinsulinemia (100-300 mU/L) with marked insulin resistance in the face of normoglycemia; stage C of pronounced hyperinsulinemia with hyperglycemia < or =500 mg/ml; stage D at 6-10 weeks after stage C, featuring further hyperglycemia and loss of insulin. Insulin resistance expressed in Psammomys at stages B and C was demonstrated by nonsuppression of the hepatic  enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by the endogenous hyperinsulinemia and by the reduced capacity of insulin to activate muscle and liver  kinase of the insulin receptor. Diabetes at stage C, but not at stage D, was fully reversed to stage A by restricting the food ration of animals by half (from 14 to 7 g/day) for 10-14 days. We examined islet beta cells of Psammomys in the four stages of progression to diabetes by staining for insulin as well as for apoptosis by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and visualizing the biotin-labeled cleavage sites. Psammomys in stage A had insulin-laden beta cells. In stage B, a hypertrophy and partial insulin depletion of beta cells was evident with negative TUNEL staining. In stage C, beta cells were markedly depleted of insulin, and their number within the islets decreased, but the TUNEL staining was virtually negative. In stage D, beta cells were markedly diminished within the islets, almost void of insulin, showing distinct TUNEL staining of beta cells. These results indicate that prolonged exposure of islets to in vivo hyperglycemia with beta-cell overtaxation induces nuclear disintegration with irreversible damage to the insulin-secretion apparatus. This precludes the return to normalcy by restricting the food intake of Psammomys. The appearance of cells with TUNEL-positive staining may serve as a marker of impending irreversibility of nutritionally induced diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804231>Fructose 1,6-phosphatase: getting the message across.</a></h2><p>Fructose 1,6-phosphatase (FBPase) is a key enzyme in . It is a potential drug target in the treatment of type II diabetes. The protein is also associated with a rare inherited metabolic disease and some cancer cells lack FBPase activity which promotes glycolysis facilitating the Warburg effect. Thus, there is interest in both inhibiting the enzyme (for diabetes treatment) and restoring its activity (in relevant cancers). The mammalian enzyme is tetrameric, competitively inhibited by Fructose 2,6-phosphate and negatively allosterically regulated by AMP. This allosteric regulation requires information transmission between the AMP binding site and the active site of the enzyme. A recent paper by Topaz et al. ( (2019) , pii:BSR20180960) has added additional detail to our understanding of this information transmission process. Two residues in the AMP binding site (Lys and Tyr) were shown to be involved in initiating the message between the two sites. This  residue has recently be shown to be important with protein's interaction with the antidiabetic drug metformin. A variant designed to increase metal ion affinity (M248D) resulted in a five-fold increase in enzymatic activity. Interestingly alterations of two residues at the subunit interfaces (Tyr and Met) resulted in increased responsiveness to AMP. Overall, these findings may have implications in the design of novel FBPase inhibitors or activators.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6133774>Biochemistry of liver development in the perinatal period.</a></h2><p>Just before birth, changes occur in the metabolic capacities of rat liver so that the animal can adapt to changes in the substrate supply. In utero, glucose is the main energy-generating fuel and the liver metabolism is directed towards glucose degradation. The activities of the rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis, hexokinase and phosphofructokinase, are high. In preparation for post-natal life, when the continuous glucose supply from the mother is interrupted, very large amounts of glycogen are stored in the late fetal liver. With the intake of the fat-rich and carbohydrate-poor milk diet, the animal develops the ability to synthesize glucose de novo from non-carbohydrate precursors. During suckling, metabolic energy is derived mainly from the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, which in turn is an essential prerequisite for the high rate of , by yielding acetyl-CoA for the activation of pyruvate carboxylase and by generating a high NADH/NAD ratio for the shift of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction in the direction of glucose formation.--The developmental adaptation of metabolism and the process of enzymatic differentiation are closely connected with the maturation of the endocrine system and the changes in the concentration of circulating hormones. The neonatal regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and of  aminotransferase by variations in the hormonal milieu around birth, and also the interaction of hormonal and nutritional factors in the induction of serine dehydratase and glucokinase at the end of the suckling period, will be discussed in detail.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8100835>Vanadate treatment restores the expression of genes for key enzymes in the glucose and ketone bodies metabolism in the liver of diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Oral administration of vanadate to diabetic streptozotocin-treated rats decreased the high blood glucose and D-3-hydroxybutyrate levels related to diabetes. The increase in the expression of the P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene, the main regulatory enzyme of , was counteracted in the liver and the kidney after vanadate administration to diabetic rats. Vanadate also counteracted the induction in  aminotransferase gene expression due to diabetes and was able to increase the expression of the glucokinase gene to levels even higher than those found in healthy animals. Similarly, an induction in pyruvate kinase mRNA transcripts was observed in diabetic vanadate-treated rats. These effects were correlated with changes on glucokinase and pyruvate kinase activities. Vanadate treatment caused a decrease in the expression of the liver-specific glucose transporter, GLUT-2. Thus, vanadate was able to restore liver glucose utilization and block glucose production in diabetic rats. The increase in the expression of the mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCoAS) gene, the key regulatory enzyme in the ketone bodies production pathway, observed in diabetic rats was also blocked by vanadate. Furthermore, a similar pattern in the expression of PEPCK, GLUT-2, HMGCoAS, and the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha genes has been observed. All of these results suggest that the regulation of the expression of genes involved in the glucose and ketone bodies metabolism could be a key step in the normalization process induced by vanadate administration to diabetic rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11795521>Calorie restriction enhances the expression of key metabolic enzymes associated with protein renewal during aging.</a></h2><p>Our studies show that dietary caloric restriction (CR) alters the expression of key metabolic enzymes in a manner consistent with an increased rate of extrahepatic protein turnover and renewal during aging. Of the key hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme genes affected by CR, glucose 6-phosphatase mRNA increased 1.7- and 2.3-fold in young and old CR mice. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA increased 2-fold in young mice, and its mRNA and activity increased 2.5- and 1.7-fold in old mice. These changes indicate that CR enhances the enzymatic capacity for . The carbon required for  appears to be generated from peripheral protein turnover. Muscle glutamine synthetase mRNA increased 1.3- and 2.1-fold in young and old CR mice, suggesting increased disposal of nitrogen and carbon derived from protein catabolism for energy. mRNA for the key liver nitrogen disposal enzymes glutaminase, carbamyl phosphate synthase I, and  aminotransferase were increased by 2.4-, 1.8-, and 1.8-fold in CR mice. Consistent with increased hepatic nitrogen disposal, hepatic glutamine synthetase mRNA and activity were each decreased about 40% in CR mice. Together, these and our other published data suggest that CR enhances and maintains protein turnover, and thus protein renewal, into old age. These effects are likely to resist the well-documented decline in whole body protein renewal with age. Enhanced renewal may reduce the level of damaged and toxic proteins that accumulate during aging, contributing to the extension of life span by CR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9491639>[Molecular endocrinology of hereditary obesity].</a></h2><p>The hypothalamic disorders of obesity include hyperphagia, a low central orthosympathetic tone (with reduced thermogenesis), vagal hyperinsulinism, low serotonin efficacy, a hyperactive hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenal axis, a hypoactive GHRH-GH-IGF axis and hypogonadism of central origin. Hyperlipogenesis, glucose intolerance and excessive  are secondary features. Most frequently the hypothalamic ARC reacts poorly to the leptin hypersecreted by adipose tissue, so that the local synthesis of NPY is unchecked. Fortunately, two prostaglandins derived from dietary arachidonic acid bind fat cell PPAR gamma and hepatic PPAR alpha. Both nuclear proteins are phosphorylated through an insulin pathway, thereby inhibiting the expression of genes favoring obesity and stimulating that of genes accelerating fatty acid oxidation. The array of dietetic and pharmacologic tools considered today is analyzed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27349515>In vitro studies on the pleotropic antidiabetic effects of zinc oxide nanoparticles.</a></h2><p>Our earlier study demonstrated antidiabetic activity of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZON) in diabetic rats.

Exposure of these cells to leptin, at concentrations comparable with those present in obese individuals, caused attenuation of several insulin-induced activities, including  phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), association of the adapter molecule growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 with IRS-1, and down-regulation of .

Vanadium species may be possible deterrents for the growth of the Leishmania parasite, which causes the sometimes deadly diseases known as leishmaniasis. The current studies focus specifically on decavanadate V(10)O(28)(6-) (V10), which has a potential to be a potent effector for disease treatment. The X-ray structure of a new solvate salt of V10, namely (NH(4))(6)V(10)O(28)·5H(2)O, is also reported. Other vanadium complexes with imidazole carboxylate, anthranilate, or picolinate were also evaluated. The yellow-orange oxoanion, used as the (NH(4))(6)V(10)O(28)·6H(2)O salt, was tested (at 1-100 μM) directly with two strains of Leishmania tarentolae promastigotes in culture to evaluate the effect on cell viability. Vanadium coordination complexes are known effective inhibitors of phosphatases. Using the artificial phosphatase substrate para-nitrophenylphosphate in the presence of a bovine calf intestine alkaline phosphatase enzyme, V10 (from 5 to 100 μM) was shown to be a mixed inhibitor for this enzyme and decreased the activity of the other two phosphatases tested. The effect of V10 and the other vanadium complexes on the activity of phosphoglycerate mutase B (PGAM), an important enzyme in glycolysis and , was also evaluated. At 10 μM, V10 was the most potent inhibitor of PGAM, with an apparent reduction of about 50%. Taken together, we speculate that V10 could have a role in treating Leishmania diseases.Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Oral administration of acephate (140mg/kg b.w.) caused reversible hyperglycemia as evidenced by peak increase in blood glucose at 2h after the administration (87% over control) followed by trend of normalization. In further experiment carried out to understand the etiology of the induced hyperglycemia, we observed that 2h exposure to acephate caused significant increase in blood glucose, plasma corticosterone (78%) and activities of two  enzymes in liver viz., glucose-6-phosphatase (91%) and  aminotransferase (84%) compared to that in control. When rats were exposed to acephate for 6h, decrement was observed in elevated levels of blood glucose, plasma corticosterone and the  enzymes of the liver. Adrenal cholesterol levels in acephate-exposed rats were significantly depleted. While the glycogen content in liver of 2-h exposure group was comparable to control, a tremendous increase in liver glycogen content ( approximately 3.5 folds) was observed in rats of the 6-h exposure group.

Herein, comparative metabolomics was adopted to analyze the variations in the hemolymph metabolites of different resistant silkworm strains following BmNPV inoculation using a H NMR method. Trehalose, as an instant source of energy, plays a crucial role in the response to pathogen infections in insects. The level of trehalose was persistently upregulated in the hemolymph of the resistant silkworm strain YeA following infection with BmNPV, compared to that of the susceptible strain YeB, indicating that trehalose metabolism plays a vital role in the response to BmNPV infection. The significant upregulation of TCA cycle relevant metabolites, including malate, fumarate, citrate, succinate, and α-ketoglutarate, was identified at 0 h, 12 h, 48 h, and 96 h post-infection in YeA hemolymph, whereas a significant upregulation in YeB hemolymph was only detected at an early stage of infection (0 h-24 h). The expression level of selected key metabolic enzymes, determined using RT-qPCR, validated the differences in trehalose and TCA cycle relevant metabolite levels. The variations in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) pathway relevant metabolites in resistant silkworm strains following BmNPV infection showed a regular undulation at different times after infection. A significant accumulation of phenylalanine and  was observed in YeA following BmNPV infection compared to YeB. The glycolysis and  pathways showed a relatively low activity in YeA following BmNPV infection. Moreover, the levels of other metabolites related to fat metabolism, transamination, energy metabolism, and glycometabolism, such as glycine, threonine, glutamine, and glutamate, were unstable in the two silkworm strains following BmNPV infection. Thus, our study provides an overview of the metabolic response of the silkworm in response to BmNPV infection, which lays the foundation for clarifying the mechanism of silkworm resistance to BmNPV infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study tests the hypothesis that free radical metabolism of low chronic exposure to bromodichloromethane (BDCM), a disinfection byproduct of drinking water, causes nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), mediated by cytochrome P450 isoform CYP2E1 and adipokine leptin. Using diet-induced obese mice (DIO), mice deficient in CYP2E1, and mice with spontaneous knockout of the leptin gene, we show that BDCM caused increased lipid peroxidation and increased  nitration in DIO mice, events dependent on reductive metabolism by CYP2E1. DIO mice, exposed to BDCM, exhibited increased hepatic leptin levels and higher levels of proinflammatory gene expression and Kupffer cell activation. Obese mice exposed to BDCM also showed profound hepatic necrosis, Mallory body formation, collagen deposition, and higher alpha smooth muscle actin expression, events that are hallmarks of NASH. The absence of CYP2E1 gene in mice that were fed with a high-fat diet did not show NASH symptoms and were also protected from hepatic metabolic alterations in Glut-1, Glut-4, phosphofructokinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene expressions (involved in carbohydrate metabolism), and UCP-1, PGC-1α, SREBP-1c, and PPAR-γ genes (involved in hepatic fat metabolism). Mice lacking the leptin gene were significantly protected from both NASH and metabolic alterations following BDCM exposure, suggesting that higher levels of leptin induction by BDCM in the liver contribute to the development of NASH and metabolic alterations in obesity. These results provide novel insights into BDCM-induced NASH and hepatic metabolic reprogramming and show the regulation of obesity-linked susceptibility to NASH by environmental factors, CYP2E1, and leptin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20484139>T-cell protein  phosphatase attenuates STAT3 and insulin signaling in the liver to regulate .</a></h2><p>Insulin-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling and interleukin-6 (IL-6)-instigated JAK/STAT3-signaling pathways in the liver inhibit the expression of gluconeogenic genes to decrease hepatic glucose output. The insulin receptor (IR) and JAK1  kinases and STAT3 can serve as direct substrates for the T-cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP). Homozygous TCPTP-deficiency results in perinatal lethality prohibiting any informative assessment of TCPTP's role in glucose homeostasis.

The reduced hepatic glucose output coincided with decreased expression of the gluconeogenic genes G6pc and Pck1 and enhanced hepatic STAT3 phosphorylation and PI3K/Akt signaling in the fasted state. Insulin-induced IR-beta-subunit Y1162/Y1163 phosphorylation and PI3K/Akt signaling and IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation were also enhanced in isolated Ptpn2+/- hepatocytes.

Low energy states activate the intracellular energy sensor AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). AMPK activation by the AMP mimetic AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside) has been shown to inhibit hepatic . We used transcriptional profiling to search for AICAR-regulated genes in hepatocyte cell lines. We report that a dual specificity phosphatase, Dusp4, is induced by AMPK in AML12, H4IIE, and Fao cells at both mRNA and protein levels. AMPK also induces the immediate early transcription factor Egr1 (early growth response 1), a known transcriptional activator of Dusp4, and it directly binds the Dusp4 promoter at its known binding site. Both reporter gene assays and real time PCR demonstrate that exogenous DUSP4 inhibits the promoter activity and expression of both glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc-6-P) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pepck) to an extent similar to both AICAR and constitutively active AMPK. Conversely, depletion of EGR1 or DUSP4 using siRNA not only partially abrogates the inhibition of Pepck expression by AICAR, but also importantly affects glucose production by Fao cells. In Fao cells, small interfering RNA targeted EGR1 also depletes DUSP4 expression following treatment with AICAR, further supporting a direct link between EGR1 and DUSP4 activation. Expression of a constitutively active form of p38, a known effector of cAMP-mediated , rescues the DUSP4-mediated repression of PEPCK.

Insulin signaling plays a key role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. In this study, we test the hypothesis that rapid alteration of insulin signaling pathways could be a potential contributor to acute hyperglycemia after MI. Male rats were used to produce MI by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Plasma glucose and insulin levels were significantly higher in MI rats than those in controls. Insulin-stimulated  phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) was reduced significantly in the liver tissue of MI rats compared with controls, followed by decreased attachment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) p85 subunit with IRS1 and Akt phosphorylation. However, insulin-stimulated signaling was not altered significantly in skeletal muscle after MI. The relative mRNA levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and G6Pase were slightly higher in the liver tissue of MI rats than those in controls. Rosiglitazone (ROSI) markedly restored hepatic insulin signaling, inhibited  and reduced plasma glucose levels in MI rats. Insulin resistance develops rapidly in liver but not skeletal muscle after MI, which contributes to acute hyperglycemia. Therapy aimed at potentiating hepatic insulin signaling may be beneficial for MI-induced hyperglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8809577>[Metabolic evaluation of cultured porcine hepatocyte monolayers in human plasma from hepatic failure patients--basic study on development of a bioreactor in hybrid artificial liver].</a></h2><p>In order to develop a functional bioreactor for hybrid artificial liver, function of cultured porcine hepatocyte monolayers in human plasma from hepatic failure patients (group III, n = 5) was investigated. Culture media, Leibovitz L-15 medium (group I, n = 7) and normal human plasma (group II, n = 3), were used as controls. Morphologically, no degeneration of porcine hepatocytes in hepatic failure plasma was observed for 5 days in culture. Levels of ureogenesis showed no significant difference against the controls at day 1, 2, 5 in culture, but the level at day 3 was significantly higher than that of group II. Levels of  showed a close tendency as those of ureogenesis, but the level at day 3 was significantly lower than that of group I. Levels of intracellular DNA contents, showing between 1.85 +/- 0.39 and 1.35 +/- 0.05 microgram/cm2, were compatible with those of controls during first three days in culture, but level of group III at day 5 was significantly higher than that of group I.

The animals were treated with either 6 IU synthetic ACTH or 5 ml physiological saline (control) administered intravenously via a jugular vein catheter. Blood was withdrawn 60 and 5 min pretreatment (baseline), and 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, and 420 min post-treatment. A rapid positive response (P < 0.05) in plasma cortisol occurred within 10 min of administration of 6 IU ACTH. The maximum increase in plasma cortisol concentration occurred at 1 h post-ACTH treatment and plasma cortisol returned to baseline 4 h later. Until 7 d after ACTH administration, no effect on milk yield was recorded. In comparison with the saline-treated group, the ACTH-treated group exhibited a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the plasma concentrations of 3-methylhistidine, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, valine, and glucose. In contrast, the concentrations of alanine, aspartate, glutamate, glutamine and proline decreased significantly (P < 0.05) after ACTH treatment. Hormone administration had no effect on the plasma arginine, asparagine, methionine, phenylalanine, serine, threonine, , and urea.

Higher level of PEPCK mRNA was observed in spherical rat primary hepatocytes on EHS-gel than monolayer hepatocytes on TIC (type I collagen). We found that PB directly suppressed PEPCK gene expression in spherical hepatocytes on EHS-gel, but not in those on TIC. PB strongly suppressed cAMP-dependent induction of PEPCK gene expression.  aminotransferase (TAT), another gluconeogenic enzyme, was induced by cAMP, but not suppressed by PB. Chronic administration of PB reduced hepatic PEPCK mRNA in streptozotocin-induced diabetic and nondiabetic rats, and PB reduced blood glucose level in diabetic rats. Increased TAT mRNA in diabetic rats was not suppressed by PB. These results indicated that PB-dependent reduction is specific to PEPCK. From pyrvate challenge test, PB suppressed the increased gluconeogenesis in diabetic rats. PEPCK gene promoter activity was suppressed by PB in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, we found that spherical hepatocytes cultured on EHS-gel are capable to respond to PB to suppress PEPCK gene expression. Moreover, our results indicate that hypoglycemic action of PB result from transcriptional repression of PEPCK gene and subsequent suppression of gluconeogenesis.Copyright © 2015.

However, it is unclear whether or not marein, a major compound of C. tinctoria, could improve insulin resistance. Here we investigate the effect and mechanism of action of marein on improving insulin resistance in HepG2 cells.We investigated the protective effects of marein in high glucose-induced human liver carcinoma cell HepG2. In kinase inhibitor studies, genistein, LY294002, STO-609 and compound C were added to HepG2 cells 1h before the addition of marein. Transfection with siRNA was used to knock down LKB1, and 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl) amino)-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG), an effective tracer, was used to detect glucose uptake.The results showed for the first time that marein significantly stimulates the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the Akt substrate of 160kDa (AS160) and enhanced the translocation of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) to the plasma membrane. Further study indicated that genistein (an insulin receptor  kinase inhibitor) altered the effect of marein on glucose uptake, and both LY294002 (a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) and compound C (an AMP-activated protein kinase inhibitor) significantly decreased marein-stimulated 2-NBDG uptake. Additionally, marein-stimulated glucose uptake was blocked in the presence of STO-609, a CaMKK inhibitor; however, marein-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation was not blocked by LKB1 siRNA in HepG2 cells. Marein also inhibited the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) at Ser 612, but inhibited GSK-3β phosphorylation and increased glycogen synthesis. Moreover, marein significantly decreased the expression levels of FoxO1, G6Pase and PEPCK.Consequently, marein improved insulin resistance induced by high glucose in HepG2 cells through CaMKK/AMPK/GLUT1 to promote glucose uptake, through IRS/Akt/GSK-3β to increase glycogen synthesis, and through Akt/FoxO1 to decrease .

Insulin resistance is the key in this process because of the inability of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose production, thereby allowing an unopposed glucagon effect. Glyburide, one of the second-generation sulfonylureas, decreases glucose production and enhances insulin action in the liver. Available data suggest that glyburide: (1) enhances glycogen synthesis in the liver by increasing glycogen synthase; (2) inhibits glycogenolysis by decreasing phosphorylase alpha activity; and (3) decreases  and stimulates glycolysis by decreasing A-kinase activity, which results in increased fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, one of the key regulators of carbohydrate metabolism in the liver.

In addition, the most commonly occurring PTMs involve similar residues in proteins such as acetylation, ubiquitylation, methylation and sumoylation at the lysine residue and phosphorylation and O-GlcNAc modification at serine/threonine residues. Thus, the possibility of modification sites where two such PTMs may occur in a mutually exclusive manner (ME-PTM) is much higher than known. A recent surge in the identification and the mapping of the commonly occurring PTMs in proteins has revealed that this is indeed the case. However, in what way such ME-PTM sites are regulated and what could be their relevance in the coordinated network of protein function remains to be known. To gain such potential insights in a biological context, we analyzed two most prevalent PTMs on the lysine residue by acetylation and ubiquitylation along with the most abundant PTM in proteins by phosphorylation among enzymes involved in glucose metabolism, a fundamental process in biology. The analysis of the PTM data sets has revealed two important clues that may be intrinsically associated with their regulation and function. First, the most commonly occurring PTMs by phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitylation are widespread and clustered in most of the enzymes involved in glucose metabolism; and the prevalence of phosphorylation sites correlates with the number of acetylation and ubiquitylation sites including the ME-modification sites. Second, the prevalence of ME-acetylation/ubiquitylation sites is exceptionally high among enzymes involved in glucose metabolism and have distinct pattern among the subset of enzymes of glucose metabolism such as glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glycogen synthesis, and the irreversible steps of . We hypothesize that phosphorylation including  phosphorylation plays an important role in the regulation of ME-acetylation/ubiquitylation sites and their similar pattern among the subset of functionally related proteins allows their coordinated regulation in the normal physiology. Similarly their coordinated dysregulation may underlie the disease processes such as reprogrammed metabolism in cancer, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Our hypothesis provides an opportunity to understand the regulation of ME-PTMs in proteins and their relevance at the network level and is open for experimental validation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3316916>Protein degradation during endurance exercise and recovery.</a></h2><p>During endurance exercise, there is a net breakdown of body protein and the amino acids so mobilized are available for increased rates of oxidation and .

The rate of degradation of contractile proteins is decreased during exercise but is increased during the recovery period if the exercise is of high intensity and of long duration. Preliminary evidence suggests that the rate of degradation of non-contractile proteins in muscle may be increased at the same time that contractile protein degradation is decreased.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3085650>Amino acid catabolism by perfused rat hindquarter. The metabolic fates of valine.</a></h2><p>Hindquarters from starved rats were perfused with plasma concentrations of amino acids, but without other added substrates. Release of amino acids was similar to that previously reported, but, if total amino acid changes were recorded, alanine and glutamine were not formed in excess of their occurrence in muscle proteins. In protein balance (excess insulin) there was no net formation of either alanine or glutamine, even though the branched-chain amino acids and methionine were consumed. If [U-14C]valine was present, radiolabelled 3-hydroxyisobutyrate and, to a lesser extent, 2-oxo-3-methylbutyrate accumulated and radiolabel was incorporated into citrate-cycle intermediates and metabolites closely associated with the citrate cycle (glutamine and glutamate, and, to a smaller extent, lactate and alanine). If a 2-chloro-4-methylvalerate was present to stimulate the branched-chain oxo acid dehydrogenase, flux through this step was accelerated, resulting in increased accumulation of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, decreased accumulation of 2-oxo-3-methylbutyrate, and markedly increased incorporation of radiolabel (specific and total) into all measured metabolites formed after 3-hydroxyisobutyrate. It is concluded that: amino acid catabolism by skeletal muscle is confined to degradation of the branched-chain amino acids, methionine and those that are interconvertible with the citrate cycle; amino acid catabolism is relatively minor in supplying carbon for net synthesis of alanine and glutamine; and partial degradation products of the branched-chain amino acids are quantitatively significant substrates released from muscle for hepatic . For valine, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate appears to be quantitatively the most important intermediate released from muscle. A side path for inter-organ disposition of the branched-chain amino acids is proposed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29503615>Metabolomics Based Profiling of Dexamethasone Side Effects in Rats.</a></h2><p>Dexamethasone (Dex) is a synthetic glucocorticoid that has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects and is used in several conditions such as asthma and severe allergy. Patients receiving Dex, either at a high dose or for a long time, might develop several side effects such as hyperglycemia, weight change, or osteoporosis due to its  non-selectivity. Herein, we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based comprehensive targeted metabolomic profiling as well as radiographic imaging techniques to study the side effects of Dex treatment in rats. The Dex-treated rats suffered from a ∼20% reduction in weight gain, hyperglycemia (145 mg/dL), changes in serum lipids, and reduction in total serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (∼600 IU/L). Also, compared to controls, Dex-treated rats showed a distinctive metabolomics profile. In particular, serum amino acids metabolism showed six-fold reduction in phenylalanine, lysine, and arginine levels and upregulation of  and hydroxyproline reflecting perturbations in  and protein catabolism which together lead to weight loss and abnormal bone metabolism. Sorbitol level was markedly elevated secondary to hyperglycemia and reflecting activation of the polyol metabolism pathway causing a decrease in the availability of reducing molecules (glutathione, NADPH, NAD). Overexpression of succinylacetone (4,6-dioxoheptanoic acid) suggests a novel inhibitory effect of Dex on hepatic fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase. The acylcarnitines, mainly the very long chain species (C12, C14:1, C18:1) were significantly increased after Dex treatment which reflects degradation of the adipose tissue. In conclusion, long-term Dex therapy in rats is associated with a distinctive metabolic profile which correlates with its side effects. Therefore, metabolomics based profiling may predict Dex treatment-related side effects and may offer possible novel therapeutic interventions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30101382>Transcriptome analysis in Malus halliana roots in response to iron deficiency reveals insight into sugar regulation.</a></h2><p>Iron (Fe) deficiency is a frequent nutritional problem limiting apple production in calcareous soils. The utilization of rootstock that is resistant to Fe deficiency is an effective way to solve this problem. Malus halliana is an Fe deficiency-tolerant rootstock; however, few molecular studies have been conducted on M. halliana. In the present work, a transcriptome analysis was combined with qRT-PCR and sugar measurements to investigate Fe deficiency responses in M. halliana roots at 0 h (T1), 12 h (T2) and 72 h (T3) after Fe deficiency stress. Total of 2473, 661, and 776 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the pairs of T2 vs. T1, T3 vs. T1, and T3 vs. T2, respectively. Several DEGs were enriched in the photosynthesis, glycolysis and ,  metabolism and fatty acid degradation pathways. The glycolysis and photosynthesis pathways were upregulated under Fe deficiency. In this experiment, sucrose accumulated in Fe-deficient roots and leaves. However, the glucose content significantly decreased in the roots, while the fructose content significantly decreased in the leaves. Additionally, 15 genes related to glycolysis and sugar synthesis and sugar transport were selected to validate the accuracy of the transcriptome data by qRT-PCR. Overall, these results indicated that sugar synthesis and metabolism in the roots were affected by Fe deficiency. Sugar regulation is a way by which M. halliana responds to Fe deficiency stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8330686>Glucose metabolism in transgenic mice containing a chimeric P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase/bovine growth hormone gene.</a></h2><p>Transgenic mice, containing the chimeric gene obtained by linking the promoter-regulatory region of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene to the bovine growth hormone structural gene (bGH), were used to investigate the long-term effects of bGH on glucose metabolism. Expression of the PEPCK/bGH gene was markedly enhanced by feeding a diet high in protein and inhibited by a high carbohydrate diet. All transgenic mice had normal levels of blood glucose but were hyperinsulinemic, indicating that they were insulin resistant. The glycogen synthase activity ratios in the muscle and liver of transgenic mice were lower than noted for control animals, and remained unchanged in liver after feeding a standard high carbohydrate or a high protein diet. Similar effects were detected in the activity of glycogen phosphorylase, except that a high carbohydrate diet activated this enzyme in the liver. The activation of glycogen phosphorylase in both muscle and liver correlated with the expression of their genes. These animals had a significant content of glycogen and glucose 6-phosphate, which was related to the levels of glucokinase mRNA in the liver. The concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate in the liver of all fed transgenic mice was lower than noted in livers from fed animals. In addition, a decrease in the hepatic expression of the endogenous genes for PEPCK,  aminotransferase (TAT), and the glucose transporter GLUT-2 was observed and directly correlated with the expression of bGH. Thus, bGH can control glucose metabolism in vivo, at least in part, by modifying the expression of several genes coding for proteins of importance in carbohydrate metabolism. Taken together, these results indicate a state of insulin resistance caused by chronic exposure of the animals to an elevated concentration of bGH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15118319>Inverse correlation between the nitrogen balance and induction of rat liver serine dehydratase (SDH) by dietary protein.</a></h2><p>Rats of different ages (3 to 15-wk-old) were fed on a 25% casein diet for one week, and the nitrogen balance and liver serine dehydratase (SDH, EC 4.2.1.13) activity were then determined. The value for nitrogen balance decreased with the age of the rats, while the liver SDH activity increased. A statistical analysis showed clear inverse correlation between the two factors (R(2) = 0.7372, p < 0.01). This result suggests that SDH was induced by response to the amount of surplus amino acids from dietary protein taken beyond the body's requirement. The increase in SDH activity was accompanied by an increase in the level of SDH mRNA. Since the half-life of this mRNA did not change significantly, the induction was mainly controlled at the level of transcription. In addition, the induction seems not to be related to , since the mRNA levels of  aminotransferase (TAT) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), other gluconeogenic enzymes, were not changed under these experimental conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11181544>Comprehensive messenger ribonucleic acid profiling reveals that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma activation has coordinate effects on gene expression in multiple insulin-sensitive tissues.</a></h2><p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) agonists, including the glitazone class of drugs, are insulin sensitizers that reduce glucose and lipid levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. To more fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying their therapeutic actions, we have characterized the effects of the potent, -based PPAR gamma ligand GW1929 on serum glucose and lipid parameters and gene expression in Zucker diabetic fatty rats. In time-course studies, GW1929 treatment decreased circulating FFA levels before reducing glucose and triglyceride levels. We used a comprehensive and unbiased messenger RNA profiling technique to identify genes regulated either directly or indirectly by PPAR gamma in epididymal white adipose tissue, interscapular brown adipose tissue, liver, and soleus skeletal muscle. PPAR gamma activation stimulated the expression of a large number of genes involved in lipogenesis and fatty acid metabolism in both white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue. In muscle, PPAR gamma agonist treatment decreased the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, which represses oxidative glucose metabolism, and also decreased the expression of genes involved in fatty acid transport and oxidation. These changes suggest a molecular basis for PPAR gamma-mediated increases in glucose utilization in muscle. In liver, PPAR gamma activation coordinately decreased the expression of genes involved in . We conclude from these studies that the antidiabetic actions of PPAR gamma agonists are probably the consequence of 1) their effects on FFA levels, and 2), their coordinate effects on gene expression in multiple insulin-sensitive tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24960264>Cyclosporine A enhances gluconeogenesis while sirolimus impairs insulin signaling in peripheral tissues after 3 weeks of treatment.</a></h2><p>Cyclosporine A (CsA) and sirolimus (SRL) are immunosuppressive agents (IA) associated with new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT). This study aims to evaluate the effects of 3-weeks of treatment with either CsA (5 mg/kg BW/day) or SRL (1 mg/kg BW/day) on insulin signaling and expression of markers involved in glucose metabolism in insulin-sensitive tissues, in Wistar rats. Although no differences were observed in fasting glucose, insulin or C-peptide levels, both treated groups displayed an impaired glucose excursion during both glucose and insulin tolerance tests. These results suggest glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. An increase in glucose-6-phosphatase protein levels (68%, p < 0.05) and in protein- phosphatase 1B (163%, p < 0.05), a negative regulator of insulin was observed in the CsA-treated group in the liver, indicating enhanced gluconeogenesis and increased insulin resistance. On the other hand, glucokinase protein levels were decreased in the SRL group (35%, p < 0.05) compared to vehicle, suggesting a decrease in glucose disposal. SRL treatment also reduced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 alpha protein expression in muscle (~50%, p < 0.05), while no further protein alterations were observed in muscle and perirenal adipose tissue nor with the CsA treatment. Moreover, the phosphorylation of key proteins of the insulin signaling cascade was suppressed in the SRL group, but was unchanged by the CsA treatment. Taken together, these data suggest that CsA treatment enhances gluconeogenic factors in liver, while SRL treatment impairs insulin signaling in peripheral tissues, which can contribute to the development of insulin resistance and NODAT associated with immunosuppressive therapy.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, moderated milk replacer restriction during the artificial rearing period might negatively affect feed efficiency during the postweaning phases in dairy ewes. The aim of this work was to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes by RNA sequencing and differentially accumulated proteins using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in the liver of artificially reared Assaf lambs to identify modified metabolic pathways as a consequence of milk replacer restriction in order to find possible solutions to correct any detrimental effect caused by this factor. Forty female Assaf lambs were used in this experiment. The animals were penned individually and assigned randomly to 1 of 2 treatments groups (n = 20 per treatment). The first group of lambs was fed ad libitum (AL), whereas the second (restricted, RES) only received approximately 62.5% of the level of intake measured in the AL group. Eight 35-d-old lambs from each group (16 lambs in total) were harvested and a piece of liver of 8 lambs (4 AL and 4 RES lambs) was excised for transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Differential gene expression analysis identified 386 DE genes [198 of them being annotated genes in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway], with 176 downregulated and 210 upregulated in the early feed-restricted group relative to the AL group. A total of 26 spots were also differentially accumulated proteins in the liver of the 2 groups of lambs, 10 of them being down-accumulated whereas the other 16 evolved in the opposite way in the liver of RES relative to AL lambs. Collectively, both the transcriptomic and proteomic approaches revealed an upregulation of genes participating in oxidation of fatty acids in the early feed-restricted lambs. The expression of many genes involved in the degradation of several AA (e.g. alanine, valine, isoleucine, ) was also modified in the RES lambs, probably to render substrates for . Moreover, other genes involved in apoptosis, inflammation, or hepatic oxidative pathways were upregulated in these lambs. Finally, the expression of genes implicated in oxidative phosphorylation was modified in RES animals. Altogether all these modifications suggest that the partitioning and utilization of nutrients in the early feed-restricted lambs might have been modified, being partially responsible for changes during the replacement phase later in life.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The mechanisms involved in hyperglycemia induced by CPF were studied. A single dose of CPF (50 mg kg(-1), subcutaneous, s.c.) was administered to overnight-fasted rats. Glucose and corticosterone levels, lipid status and paraoxonase (PON1) activity were determined in plasma of rats. Cardiovascular risk factors and the atherogenic index were calculated. Glycogen levels,  aminotransferase (TAT) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activities were determined in livers of rats. Cerebral acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was also determined. CPF caused an increase in glucose and glycogen levels as well as in TAT and G6Pase activities. The CPF exposure caused an increase in corticosterone levels, an inhibition of AChE activity and a reduction of PON1 activity. Regarding the lipid status, CPF induced an increase in triglycerides (TG) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL) levels and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels associated with an increase of cardiovascular risk factors and the atherogenic index. The present study demonstrated that a single CPF administration caused hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in rats. The activation of the  pathway, probably elicited by hypercorticosteronemia, is involved in the hyperglycemic effect of CPF in rats.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Hepatocytes were isolated by two-step perfusion of livers, using collagenase with hyaluronidase; fructose and trypsin inhibitor were included to reduce cell loss. Yields from a single liver average 4 X 10(9) cells with viabilities of 90.8 +/- 5.7%. Cells, plated on collagen substrates, were assessed for changes in morphology and various marker enzyme activities over a period of 7 d in culture. Cells exhibited a morphology similar to that observed for this species in vivo; little change in attached and spread cells was observed over the length of time monitored. Enzyme activities for catalase, succinate dehydrogenase, and  aminotransferase were observed to decrease significantly (though considerable activity remained), whereas acid phosphatase and 5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase remained unchanged. Activity of cytochrome P-450 reductase was observed to increase slightly for the first 2 d, then decrease to about 60% of initial levels. Activity of alpha-mannosidase was stable for 4 d but was observed to be increased at Day 7. Cells were observed to retain metabolic responsiveness, demonstrated by glucose production by both  and glycogenolysis in response to glucagon stimulation.

We have recently reported that FFA can induce  in hepatocytes through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38). In this study, we have investigated the role of p38 in oleate-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Our results show that a prolonged treatment of primary hepatocytes with oleate blunted insulin suppression of hepatic , and decreased insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt in a p38-dependent manner. Reduction of the insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation by oleate correlated with activation of p38. In the presence of p38 inhibition, prolonged exposure of hepatocytes to oleate failed to reduce insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt. An siRNA against p38alpha prevented oleate suppression of the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt. Furthermore, a prolonged exposure of hepatocytes to oleate decreased insulin-induced  phosphorylation of IRS1/2, while slightly increasing serine phosphorylation of IRS. The decrease of insulin-stimulated  phosphorylation of IRS1/2 in hepatocytes by oleate was reversed by the inhibition of p38. We further show that a prolonged exposure of primary hepatocytes to oleate elevated the protein level of the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) gene in a p38-dependent manner, but had no effect on the mRNA level of PTEN. Knocking down the PTEN gene prevented oleate to inhibit insulin activation of Akt and insulin suppression of .

Protein kinetics, nitrogen balance, tumor kinetics, fractional synthetic rates of individual tissues, and albumin synthesis were compared in male Sprague-Dawley rats (125-145 g) that had either s.c. Yoshida sarcoma (n = 15) or sham implantations (n = 18). Ten days postinjection, rats were randomly assigned to 2 diet groups and given parenteral infusions of 4 days at 170 kcal/kg.body wt.day as dextrose and 2 g N/kg.body wt.day as either 19 or 50% branched chain amino acid-enriched diet. During the last 4 h of feeding, protein kinetic values were studied using a constant infusion of [14C]. Plasma  appearance, synthesis, and breakdown were unchanged by branched chain amino acid infusion. Percentage of  flux oxidized and  oxidation decreased (P less than 0.05) and net  balance improved (P less than 0.05) in rats receiving the branched chain amino acid-enriched diet. Greater nitrogen balance and lower tumor growth rates were also found in branched chain amino acid-infused rats although not statistically significant. Tumor intracellular specific activity was significantly higher in tumor animals receiving crystalline infusions, suggesting greater tumor protein breakdown with branched chain amino acid-enriched infusion. Fractional synthetic rates of liver, muscle, and tumor were unchanged. Hence, branched chain amino acid-enriched total parenteral nutrition increases amino acid utilization for net protein synthesis principally by reducing oxidation without stimulating tumor growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2858200>Effects of cyclic AMP, glucocorticoids and insulin on the activities of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase,  aminotransferase and glycerol kinase in isolated rat hepatocytes in relation to the control of triacylglycerol synthesis and .</a></h2><p>Rat hepatocytes were incubated in monolayer culture in modified Leibovitz L-15 medium containing either 10% (v/v) newborn-calf serum or 0.2% (w/v) fatty-acid-poor bovine serum albumin. The addition of 100 nM-dexamethasone increased the activities of both phosphatidate phosphohydrolase and  aminotransferase by about 3.5-fold after 8h, and these activities continued to rise until at least 24h. Incubating the hepatocytes in the albumin-containing medium with 10 microM- or 100 microM-8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate increased the activities of the phosphohydrolase and aminotransferase by 2.6- and 3.4-fold respectively after 8h. These increases were blocked by actinomycin D. The increases in the activities that were produced by the cyclic AMP analogue and dexamethasone were independent and approximately additive. Insulin when added alone did not alter the phosphohydrolase activity, but it increased the aminotransferase activity by 34%. The dexamethasone-induced increase in the phosphohydrolase activity was completely blocked by 7-144 microM-insulin, whereas that of the aminotransferase was only partly suppressed. Insulin had no significant Effects on the increases in the activities of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase and  aminotransferase that were produced by the cyclic AMP analogue, but this may be because the analogue is fairly resistant to degradation by the phosphodiesterase. The activity of glycerol kinase was not significantly changed by incubating the hepatocytes with insulin, dexamethasone and the cyclic AMP analogue alone or in combinations. It is proposed that high concentrations of cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids increase the total activity of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase in the liver and provide it with an increased capacity for synthesizing triacylglycerols and very-low-density lipoproteins, which is expressed when the availability of fatty acids is high. There appears to be a co-ordinated hormonal control of triacyglycerol synthesis and  in diabetes and in metabolic stress to enable the liver to supply other organs with energy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1981025>Characterization of immobilized hepatocytes as liver support.</a></h2><p>Hepatocytes isolated from rat liver were immobilized within Ca-alginate. Immobilized hepatocytes could remove ammonia and other toxic substances causing hepatic coma, such as indole, phenol, bilirubin, and short chain fatty acids. Although free hepatocytes lost those activities within 2 days, immobilized hepatocytes maintained those activities for more than 7 days. Immobilized hepatocytes induced  aminotransferase (TAT) in the presence of dexamethasone and dibutyryl-cAMP and retained the ability to induce TAT for more than 7 days. Biologically active form of coagulation factor II, prothrombin could be synthesized and secreted into medium by immobilized hepatocytes. Moreover, immobilized hepatocytes produced glucose from lactate, alanine, fructose, and galactose. Like adult rat liver, growth-related function and liver-specific function in immobilized hepatocytes were reciprocally controlled by cell density. There are both alpha-, and beta-adrenergic receptors in membrane of liver cells, and the adrenergic action of epinephrine is alpha-predominant in adult rat liver. Monolayer-cultured hepatocytes can not maintain alpha-adrenergic response. However, immobilized hepatocytes maintained alpha-adrenergic response as shown in vivo. Those characteristics of immobilized and three-dimensionally cultured hepatocytes are regarded almost the same as liver cells in vivo. Furthermore, therapeutic effect of immobilized hepatocytes on the hepatic failure were confirmed in the experiment using hepatocytes damaged with D-galactosamine. Therefore, it is suggested that immobilized hepatocytes could be applied to a hybrid artificial liver support.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25206547>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor inhibits glucose intolerance after cerebral ischemia.</a></h2><p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor is associated with the insulin signaling pathway and glucose tabolism. We hypothesized that expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and its receptor may be involved in glucose intolerance following ischemic stress. To verify this hypothesis, this study aimed to observe the changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor and  kinase B receptor expression in glucose metabolism-associated regions following cerebral ischemic stress in mice. At day 1 after middle cerebral artery occlusion, the expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor were significantly decreased in the ischemic cortex, hypothalamus, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. The expression levels of  kinase B receptor were decreased in the hypothalamus and liver, and increased in the skeletal muscle and pancreas, but remained unchanged in the cortex. Intrahypothalamic administration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (40 ng) suppressed the decrease in insulin receptor and -phosphorylated insulin receptor expression in the liver and skeletal muscle, and inhibited the overexpression of gluconeogenesis-associated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase in the liver of cerebral ischemic mice. However, serum insulin levels remained unchanged. Our experimental findings indicate that brain-derived neurotrophic factor can promote glucose metabolism, reduce gluconeogenesis, and decrease blood glucose levels after cerebral ischemic stress. The low expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor following cerebral ischemia may be involved in the development of glucose intolerance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2661933>Effect of chronic caloric restriction on hepatic enzymes of intermediary metabolism in the male Fischer 344 rat.</a></h2><p>It is well established that caloric restriction extends life span and significantly retards the rate of occurrence of most age-associated degenerative disease processes. A paucity of data exists relative to the mechanisms by which caloric restriction accomplishes these events. We have examined the effect of caloric restriction in rats on several hepatic enzymes of intermediary metabolism. The activities of glycolytic and supporting enzymes including lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase were all decreased in response to caloric restriction. Fructose 1-phosphate aldolase and creatine phosphokinase were not altered. Likewise, enzymes associated with lipid metabolism (malic enzyme and glycerokinase) were reduced (fatty acid synthetase was reduced, but not to a statistically significant degree). Activities of enzymes supporting  (glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase,  aminotransferase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, glutamate dehydrogenase, amino acid oxidase, malate dehydrogenase, and glucose 6-phosphatase) were either unchanged or increased significantly by caloric restriction. Glucagon levels were decreased. Comparisons between young ad libitum fed and older calorically restricted rats revealed similar but not identical metabolic activity. These results suggest that caloric restriction produces an effect on intermediary metabolism, favoring the role of glucagon and glucose synthesis; but limiting the role of insulin and glucose catabolism in the liver. The former observation provides for the efficient support of peripheral tissues and the latter a level of energy production necessary only for self maintenance. Limited lipid metabolism suggests decreased potential for fatty acid epoxide formation and free radical damage to cellular macromolecules. Additionally, caloric restriction may delay the progressive age associated changes in the activities of some of the enzymes investigated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555535>LC-MS proteomics analysis of the insulin/IGF-1-deficient Caenorhabditis elegans daf-2(e1370) mutant reveals extensive restructuring of intermediary metabolism.</a></h2><p>The insulin/IGF-1 receptor is a major known determinant of dauer formation, stress resistance, longevity, and metabolism in Caenorhabditis elegans. In the past, whole-genome transcript profiling was used extensively to study differential gene expression in response to reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling, including the expression levels of metabolism-associated genes. Taking advantage of the recent developments in quantitative liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based proteomics, we profiled the proteomic changes that occur in response to activation of the DAF-16 transcription factor in the germline-less glp-4(bn2);daf-2(e1370) receptor mutant. Strikingly, the daf-2 profile suggests extensive reorganization of intermediary metabolism, characterized by the upregulation of many core intermediary metabolic pathways. These include glycolysis/, glycogenesis, pentose phosphate cycle, citric acid cycle, glyoxylate shunt, fatty acid β-oxidation, one-carbon metabolism, propionate and  catabolism, and complexes I, II, III, and V of the electron transport chain. Interestingly, we found simultaneous activation of reciprocally regulated metabolic pathways, which is indicative of spatiotemporal coordination of energy metabolism and/or extensive post-translational regulation of these enzymes. This restructuring of daf-2 metabolism is reminiscent to that of hypometabolic dauers, allowing the efficient and economical utilization of internal nutrient reserves and possibly also shunting metabolites through alternative energy-generating pathways to sustain longevity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9163566>Lack of effect of calcitonin gene-related peptide and amylin on major markers of glucose metabolism in hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Effects of amylin and calcitonin gene-related peptide on several processes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were investigated in rat hepatocytes, non-parenchymal cells (Kupffer, Ito and endothelial cells) and alveolar macrophages. In hepatocytes, cAMP levels were increased 25-fold by glucagon (10 nM), less than 2-fold by calcitonin gene-related peptide (100 nM) and not at all by amylin (100 nM). In non-parenchymal cells and cultured alveolar macrophages, calcitonin gene-related peptide potently, and amylin weakly, stimulated cAMP levels. In hepatocytes neither amylin nor calcitonin gene-related peptide affected glycogen phosphorylase activity, glucose output, lactate uptake, glycogen synthesis, glycogen mass or  aminotransferase activity. The density of calcitonin gene-related peptide specific binding sites in parenchymal cells was 10-fold less then seen in non-parenchymal cells. We found no significant evidence of specific amylin binding sites. These results are consistent with the notion that amylin does not exert a direct effect in hepatocytes.

Dasatinib increased PGC-1α mRNA expression up to 6-fold in 3T3-F442A adipocytes, primary adipocytes, and epididymal white adipose tissue from lean and diet-induced obese mice. Importantly, gene expression translated into increased PGC-1α protein content analyzed in melanoma cells and isolated mitochondria from adipocytes. However, dasatinib treatment had adverse effect on glucose tolerance in diet-induced obese and Ob/Ob mice. This correlated with increased hepatic PGC-1α expression and the  genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase. In conclusion, we show that dasatinib is a potent inducer of PGC-1α mRNA and protein in adipose tissue. However, despite beneficial effects of increased PGC-1α content in adipose tissue, dasatinib significantly impaired glucose tolerance in obese but not lean mice. As far as we are aware, this is the first study to show that dasatinib regulates PGC-1α and causes glucose intolerance in obese mice. This should be considered in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307473>Metabolomic signatures and microbial community profiling of depressive rat model induced by adrenocorticotrophic hormone.</a></h2><p>Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-treatment rat model has been utilized as a widely accepted model of treatment-resistant depression. Metabolomic signatures represent the pathophysiological phenotype of diseases. Recent studies in gut microbiota and metabolomics analysis revealed the dramatic role of microbiome in psychoneurological system diseases, but still, the mechanisms underlying gut microbiome-host interaction remain unclear.Male Wistar rats were s.c. injection of ACTH fragment 1-24 for 14 days to induce treatment-resistant depression. Depression-related behavioral tests, analysis of serum monoamine neurotransmitters and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis-related hormones were determined for assessment of ACTH-induced depression rat model. A gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometer based urinary metabolomic signatures integrated 16S rRNA sequence analysis based gut microbial profiling was performed, as well as Spearman's correlation coefficient analysis was used to manifest the covariation between the differential urinary metabolites and gut microbiota of genus level.Chronic injection of ACTH-induced depression-like phenotype (increased immobility time in forced swimming test and tail suspension test) was accompanied by peripheral serotonin down-regulation and HPA axis overactivation (ACTH and corticosterone up-regulation). Urinary metabolomics analysis indicated that pyruvic acid, L-threonine, mannitol, D-gluconic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, D-arabitol, myo-inositol and ascorbic acid levels were reduced in ACTH-treated rats' urine, while hippurate level was elevated. In addition, microbial community profiling revealed bacterial enrichment (e.g. Ruminococcus, Klebsiella) and reduction (e.g. Akkermansia, Lactobacillus) in the ACTH-induced depression rat model. Correlation analysis showed that Akkermansia and Lactobacillus were closely relevant to metabolites myo-inositol and hippurate, which were included in host inositol phosphate metabolism, and phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis.Depression rat model induced by ACTH is associated with disturbance of pyruvate metabolism, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, and glycolysis or , as well as changes in microbial community structure. Gut microbiota may participate in the mediation of systemic metabolomic changes in ACTH-induced depression model. Therefore, integrated metabolomic signatures and gut microbial community profiling would provide a basis for further studies on the pathogenesis of depression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22124464>Endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibits STAT3-dependent suppression of hepatic  via dephosphorylation and deacetylation.</a></h2><p>In the liver, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) plays an important role in the suppression of gluconeogenic enzyme expression. While obesity-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been shown to increase hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme expression, the role of ER stress in STAT3-dependent regulation of such expression is unclear. The current study aimed to elucidate the effect of ER stress on the STAT3-dependent regulation of hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme expression. Genetically obese/diabetic db/db mice and db/db mouse-derived isolated hepatocytes were used as ER stress models. A  phosphatase inhibitor, a deacetylation inhibitor, and an acetylated mutant of STAT3 were used to examine the effect of ER stress on hepatic STAT3 action. ER stress inhibited STAT3-dependent suppression of gluconeogenic enzyme gene expression by suppressing hepatic Janus kinase (JAK)2 and STAT3 phosphorylation. A  phosphatase inhibitor restored ER stress-induced suppression of JAK2 phosphorylation but exhibited no improving effect on suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation. STAT3 acetylation is known to correlate with its phosphorylation. ER stress also decreased STAT3 acetylation. An acetylated mutant of STAT3 was resistant to ER stress-induced inhibition of STAT3-phosphorylation and STAT3-dependent suppression of hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, ameliorated ER stress-induced inhibition of STAT3 acetylation and phosphorylation. The current study revealed that ER stress inhibits STAT3-dependent suppression of hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes via JAK2 dephosphorylation and HDAC-dependent STAT3 deacetylation, playing an important role in the increase of hepatic glucose production in obesity and diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2785525>Epidermal growth factor binding, stimulation of phosphorylation, and inhibition of  in rat proximal tubule.</a></h2><p>Epidermal growth factor and insulin share many biological activities, including stimulation of cell proliferation, ion flux, glycolysis, fatty acid and glycogen synthesis, and activation of receptor-linked  kinase activity. In the kidney, insulin has been shown to regulate transport processes and inhibit  in the proximal tubule. Since the kidney represents a major source of EGF, the present studies investigated whether proximal tubule contained EGF receptors, whether EGF receptors were localized to apical or basolateral membranes, and whether EGF receptor activation participated in the regulation of an important proximal tubule function, . Specific EGF receptors were demonstrated in the basolateral membrane of proximal tubule. Following incubation with 125I EGF, basolateral membranes demonstrated equilibrium binding at 4 degrees C and 23 degrees C. There was 78 +/- 2% specific binding (n = 13). The dissociation constant (Kd) was 1.5 x 10(-9) M and maximal binding was 44 fmol/mg protein. There was ninefold more specific binding to proximal tubule basolateral membrane than to brush border membrane. In basolateral, but not brush border membranes, EGF induced phosphorylation of the  residues of intrinsic membrane proteins, including a 170 kDa protein, corresponding to the EGF receptor. In the presence of the gluconeogenic substrates, alanine, lactate, and succinate, proximal tubule suspensions synthesized glucose. EGF inhibited glucose production in a concentration-dependent manner over a concentration range of 3 x 10(-11) to 3 x 10(-9) M. In addition, EGF inhibited angiotensin II-stimulated glucose production in the proximal tubule suspensions. EGF did not significantly increase net glucose metabolism nor decrease cellular ATP concentrations. Therefore, these studies demonstrated that rat proximal tubule contained specific receptors for EGF that were localized to the basolateral membrane and linked to  kinase activity. EGF significantly inhibited proximal tubule glucose production without significantly increasing net glucose consumption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24444799>Subunit interactions in pig-kidney fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase: binding of substrate induces a second class of site with lowered affinity and catalytic activity.</a></h2><p>Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, a major enzyme of , is inhibited by AMP, Fru-2,6-P2 and by high concentrations of its substrate Fru-1,6-P2. The mechanism that produces substrate inhibition continues to be obscure.Four types of experiments were used to shed light on this: (1) kinetic measurements over a very wide range of substrate concentrations, subjected to detailed statistical analysis; (2) fluorescence studies of mutants in which phenylalanine residues were replaced by tryptophan; (3) effect of Fru-2,6-P2 and Fru-1,6-P2 on the exchange of subunits between wild-type and Glu-tagged oligomers; and (4) kinetic studies of hybrid forms of the enzyme containing subunits mutated at the active site residue -244.The kinetic experiments with the wild-type enzyme indicate that the binding of Fru-1,6-P2 induces the appearance of catalytic sites with lower affinity for substrate and lower catalytic activity. Binding of substrate to the high-affinity sites, but not to the low-affinity sites, enhances the fluorescence emission of the Phe219Trp mutant; the inhibitor, Fru-2,6-P2, competes with the substrate for the high-affinity sites. Binding of substrate to the low-affinity sites acts as a "stapler" that prevents dissociation of the tetramer and hence exchange of subunits, and results in substrate inhibition.Binding of the first substrate molecule, in one dimer of the enzyme, produces a conformational change at the other dimer, reducing the substrate affinity and catalytic activity of its subunits.Mimics of the substrate inhibition of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase may provide a future option for combatting both postprandial and fasting hyperglycemia.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the activities of gluconeogenic and transaminase enzymes in the livers of old and young mice fed either control or calorie-restricted diets. Livers were sampled 48 h after the last scheduled feeding time. Old mice on CR showed significant increases in the activities of pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase when compared with controls, indicating increased . Increased activities of , tryptophan, histidine, phenylalanine, alanine and aspartate transaminases, as well as of malate and glutamate dehydrogenases were also observed, while branched-chain amino acid transaminase was unchanged. Young mice on CR showed a significant increase only in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity in the gluconeogenic pathway, while transaminases were increased significantly, except for tryptophan and branched-chain amino acid transaminases. Glutamate dehydrogenase also showed increased activity but malate dehydrogenase was unchanged. Increases in the level of acetyl-CoA and [Acetyl-CoA]/[CoA] ratio were observed only in the old CR mice. Our results demonstrate increased gluconeogenic activity in CR mice and are consistent with a state of increased hepatic  and protein turnover during CR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26239150>In vitro effects of estrogen and progesterone containing drugs on human erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase I and II isozymes in women smokers and nonsmokers.</a></h2><p>Carbonic anhydrases (CAs), a group of metalloenzymes, are involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes such as acid-base balance, , lipogenesis, ureagenesis, electrolyte secretion in various tissues, bone resorption and calcification, and tumorigenicity. In the current study, we aimed to determine and compare possible alterations in the activity of carbonic anhydrase I (CA I) and carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) isozymes by using estrogens and progestagens in female smokers and nonsmokers.Blood samples from 30 smoker and 30 nonsmoker volunteers were drawn after obtaining informed consent. The blood samples were centrifuged to separate the plasma and erythrocytes. Thereafter, hemolysate was prepared from the red cells. CA I and CA II were purified from human erythrocytes with a simple one-step procedure using Sepharose 4B--sulfonamide affinity column. CAI and CA II isozymes were treated with estrogen and progesterone-containing drugs, after which the inhibition or activation of the enzyme was determined.CA I and CA II enzyme activity was observed to be increased in female smokers. The results of this study show that dienogest is the most effective inhibitor for human erythrocytes CA I when compared with micronized progesterone, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, estradiol valerate, and estradiol hemihydrate in both female smokers and nonsmokers. All active ingredients have been shown to have a stronger inhibition in smokers than nonsmokers for CA I activity. Additionally, estradiol valerate and hydroxyprogesterone caproate have stronger inhibition against CA II enzyme activity in women who smoke.The results of the current study provide important information to clinicians about how to consider the possible adverse effects of these drugs which are produced as a result of inhibition of CA I and CA II enzyme. Clinicians should take into consideration the side effects caused by CA I and CA II enzyme inhibition when prescribing these drugs in the treatment of different clinical conditions, especially in women who smoke.Copyright © 2015.

The number of diabetics is increasing by 4-5% per year with an estimated 40-45% of individual's over the age of 65 years having either type II diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. Since the signs of diabetes are not immediately obvious, diagnosis can be preceded by an extended period of impaired glucose tolerance resulting in the prevalence of beta-cell dysfunction and macrovascular complications. In addition to increased medical vigilance, diabetes is being combatted through aggressive treatment directed at lowering circulating blood glucose and inhibiting postprandial hyperglycemic spikes. Current strategies to treat diabetes include reducing insulin resistance using glitazones, supplementing insulin supplies with exogenous insulin, increasing endogenous insulin production with sulfonylureas and meglitinides, reducing hepatic glucose production through biguanides, and limiting postprandial glucose absorption with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. In all of these areas, new generations of small molecules are being investigated which exhibit improved efficacy and safety profiles. Promising biological targets are also emerging such as (1) insulin sensitizers including protein  phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), (2) inhibitors of  like pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDH) inhibitors, (3) lipolysis inhibitors, (4) fat oxidation including carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) I and II inhibitors, and (5) energy expenditure by means of beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists. Also important are alternative routes of glucose disposal such as Na+-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors, combination therapies, and the treatment of diabetic complications (eg. retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy). With may new opportunities for drug discovery, the prospects are excellent for development of innovative therapies to effectively manage diabetes and prevent its long term complications.

Elevating dietary Se intake (0.4 to 3.0mg/kg of diet) above the nutrient requirements, similar to overproduction of selenoproteins, led to insulin resistance and/or diabetes-like phenotypes in mice, rats, and pigs. Although its diabetogenic mechanism remains unclear, high Se intake elevated activity or production of selenoproteins including GPx1, MsrB1, SelS, and SelP. This upregulation diminished intracellular reactive oxygen species and then dysregulated key regulators of β cells and insulin synthesis and secretion, leading to chronic hyperinsulinemia. Overscavenging intracellular H2O2 also attenuated oxidative inhibition of protein  phosphatases and suppressed insulin signaling. High Se intake might affect expression and/or function of key regulators of glycolysis, , and lipogenesis. Future research is needed to find out if certain forms of Se metabolites in addition to selenoproteins and if mechanisms other than intracellular redox control mediate the diabetogenic effects of high Se intake. Furthermore, a potential interactive role of high Se intake in the interphase of carcinogenesis and diabetogenesis should be explored to make optimal use of Se in human nutrition and health.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

When 5 U of insulin/hr were added to the infusate, arterial insulin levels rose significantly from 39.7 +/- 4.1 microU/ml to approximately the pretrauma levels (74.6 +/- 7.7 microU/ml). Despite this normalization of insulin levels, excretion of nitrogen and 3-methylhistidine and the efflux of amino acids from forearm muscle fell but did not return to pretraumatic levels, suggesting some insulin resistance. Visceral  from amino acids appeared to decrease, since insulin infusion decreased the efflux of alanine from skeletal muscle with no change in its arterial level. Insulin also significantly reduced the efflux of isoleucine, , phenylalanine, glutamine, and total amino acid nitrogen from forearm muscle. These findings, along with the partial reduction in the excretion of 3-methylhistidine and nitrogen, suggest that insulin, in combination with infused calories and protein, decreases the loss of muscle protein after trauma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17068137>Developmental switch from prolonged insulin action to increased insulin sensitivity in protein  phosphatase 1B-deficient hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a negative regulator of insulin signaling and a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the differences in insulin sensitivity between neonate and adult hepatocytes lacking PTP1B. Immortalized neonatal hepatocytes and primary neonatal and adult hepatocytes have been generated from PTP1B(-/-) and wild-type mice. PTP1B deficiency in immortalized neonatal hepatocytes prolonged insulin-induced  phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR) and IR substrates (IRS) -1, -2 compared with wild-type control cells. Endogenous IR and IRS-2 were down-regulated, whereas IRS-1 was up-regulated in PTP1B(-/-) neonatal hepatocytes and livers of PTP1B(-/-) neonates. Insulin-induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway was prolonged in PTP1B(-/-) immortalized neonatal hepatocytes. However, insulin sensitivity was comparable to wild-type hepatocytes. Rescue of PTP1B in deficient cells suppressed the prolonged insulin signaling, whereas RNA interference in wild-type cells promoted prolonged signaling. In primary neonatal PTP1B(-/-) hepatocytes, insulin prolonged the inhibition of gluconeogenic mRNAs, but the sensitivity to this inhibition was similar to wild-type cells. By contrast, in adult PTP1B-deficient livers, p85alpha was down-regulated compared with the wild type. Moreover, primary hepatocytes from adult PTP1B(-/-) mice displayed enhanced Akt phosphorylation and a more pronounced inhibition of gluconeogenic mRNAs than wild-type cells. Hepatic insulin sensitivity due to PTP1B deficiency is acquired through postnatal development. Thus, changes in IR and IRS-2 expression and in the balance between regulatory and catalytic subunits of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase are necessary to achieve insulin sensitization in adult PTP1B(-/-) hepatocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22974764>Knockout of SOD1 alters murine hepatic glycolysis, , and lipogenesis.</a></h2><p>We previously observed a stronger effect of knockout of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) than that of Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) on murine body weight and glucose homeostasis. Two experiments were conducted to determine how hepatic lipid profiles and key metabolic regulators were correlated with this difference. SOD1(-/-) and GPX1(-/-) mice and their respective wild-type (WT) littermates (n=6 or 7/group, male) were fed a Se-adequate Torula yeast-sucrose diet and killed at 6 months of age to collect liver samples. In Experiment 1, fasted SOD1(-/-) mice displayed pyruvate intolerance and a 61% decrease (P<0.05) in liver glycogen compared with their WT littermates. The former had lower (P<0.05) activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, total protein phosphatase, and protein phosphatase 2A, but a higher (P<0.05) activity of glucokinase in the liver than the latter. In contrast, hepatic concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and nonesterified fatty acids were increased by 11 to 100% (P<0.05) in the SOD1(-/-) mice. Meanwhile, these mice had elevated (P<0.05) hepatic protein levels of sterol-regulatory element binding proteins 1 and 2, p53 MAPK, total and phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase α1 protein, protein  phosphatase 1B, and protein phosphatase 2B. In Experiment 2, GPX1(-/-) mice and their WT littermates were compared, but showed no difference in any of the measures. In conclusion, knockout of SOD1, but not GPX1, led to a decreased liver glycogen storage synchronized with pyruvate intolerance and elevated hepatic lipid profiles in adult mice. This striking comparison was possibly due to unique impacts of these two knockouts on intracellular tone of H(2)O(2) and key regulators of liver , glycolysis, and lipogenesis.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Careful selection of most relevant data in terms of dosage prompted this original review, largely devoted to the drug action at the cell level and whose hypotheses/conclusions are tentatively interpreted according to corresponding basic scientific knowledge. Metformin interferes with several processes linked to HGP (, glycogenolysis and their regulatory mechanisms), lowering glucose production and resensitizing the liver to insulin. The hepatic drug effect is largely favoured by prevailing glycemia. In peripheral tissues, metformin potentiates the effects of both hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Increase in glucose-mediated glucose transport is mainly mediated by an improvement in the glucose transporter's intrinsic activity. Potentiation of the hormone effect relates to an increase in insulin receptor  kinase activity. Both mechanisms (insulin signalling and glucose transport) result in the activation of glycogen synthase, a limiting enzyme in the causal defects of NIDDM. Exciting findings show that, conversely, priming cells with very low insulin concentrations also leads to full expression of metformin's antidiabetic activity. Specific investigations confirm a working hypothesis defining the site of action as the cell membrane level. Indeed metformin corrects membrane fluidity and protein configuration disturbed by the diabetic state and which interfere with normal protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions required for proper functioning of the processes regulating glucose transport/metabolism. It is proposed that membrane changes largely represent a common denominator explaining metformin effects on various systems involved in receptor signalling and related functions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27001617>System-based proteomic and metabonomic analysis of the Df(16)A mouse identifies potential miR-185 targets and molecular pathway alterations.</a></h2><p>Deletions on chromosome 22q11.2 are a strong genetic risk factor for development of schizophrenia and cognitive dysfunction. We employed shotgun liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) proteomic and metabonomic profiling approaches on prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampal (HPC) tissue from Df(16)A mice, a model of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Proteomic results were compared with previous transcriptomic profiling studies of the same brain regions. The aim was to investigate how the combined effect of the 22q11.2 deletion and the corresponding miRNA dysregulation affects the cell biology at the systems level. The proteomic brain profiling analysis revealed PFC and HPC changes in various molecular pathways associated with chromatin remodelling and RNA transcription, indicative of an epigenetic component of the 22q11.2DS. Further, alterations in /gluconeogenesis, mitochondrial function and lipid biosynthesis were identified. Metabonomic profiling substantiated the proteomic findings by identifying changes in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS)-related pathways, such as changes in ceramide phosphoethanolamines, sphingomyelin, carnitines,  derivates and panthothenic acid. The proteomic findings were confirmed using selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry, validating decreased levels of several proteins encoded on 22q11.2, increased levels of the computationally predicted putative miR-185 targets UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-peptide N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 110 kDa subunit (OGT1) and kinesin heavy chain isoform 5A and alterations in the non-miR-185 targets serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2B catalytic subunit gamma isoform, neurofilament light chain and vesicular glutamate transporter 1. Furthermore, alterations in the proteins associated with mammalian target of rapamycin signalling were detected in the PFC and with glutamatergic signalling in the hippocampus. Based on the proteomic and metabonomic findings, we were able to develop a schematic model summarizing the most prominent molecular network findings in the Df(16)A mouse. Interestingly, the implicated pathways can be linked to one of the most consistent and strongest proteomic candidates, (OGT1), which is a predicted miR-185 target. Our results provide novel insights into system-biological mechanisms associated with the 22q11DS, which may be linked to cognitive dysfunction and an increased risk to develop schizophrenia. Further investigation of these pathways could help to identify novel drug targets for the treatment of schizophrenia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115741>RNA-seq and microRNA-seq analysis of Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) larvae treated by thyroid hormones.</a></h2><p>Flatfish pigmentation is a complex process, affected by environmental factors including light, nutrients, and hormones. Of those, the thyroid hormone has been reported to increase the albinism rate of Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine, and thiourea were introduced into P. olivaceus larvae from 16 to 57 days after hatching (DAH). By comparison of albinism rate, T3 treatment and control larvae of 42 DAH were chosen for mRNA and miRNA high-throughput sequencing analyses. A total of 337 miRNAs were identified via miRNA-seq, and 12 miRNAs exhibited significantly differential expression patterns in D42_T3 versus D42_Con (TPM > 10, fold change ≥ 1.5 or ≤ 0.67 and q ≤ 0.05). These differentially expressed miRNAs targeted 3658 putative genes, which further enriched to 10 GO terms (q < 0.05). RNA-seq identified 146 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in D42_T3 versus D42_Con (|log fold change| > 1 and q < 0.005), including pigmentation-related genes such as the receptor -protein kinase erbB-3, pro-opiomelanocortin A, and melanotransferrin, and the growth-related gene somatotropin. These DEGs were significantly enriched to 15 GO terms and 8 KEGG pathways (q < 0.05), which included several sugar metabolic pathways (glycolysis/ and the pentose phosphate pathway). Integrated analysis revealed that 26 overlapping genes between DEGs and mRNAs were targeted by miRNAs. Furthermore, seven mRNA-miRNA pairs exhibited reversed regulation patterns. This provides important clues to understand the role of thyroid hormones in flatfish pigmentation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26122708>Mechanisms of activation of the transcription factor Nrf2 by redox stressors, nutrient cues, and energy status and the pathways through which it attenuates degenerative disease.</a></h2><p>Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates the basal and stress-inducible expression of a battery of genes encoding key components of the glutathione-based and thioredoxin-based antioxidant systems, as well as aldo-keto reductase, glutathione S-transferase, andquinone oxidoreductase-1 drug-metabolizing isoenzymes along with multidrug-resistance-associated efflux pumps. It therefore plays a pivotal role in both intrinsic resistance and cellular adaptation to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and xenobiotics. Activation of Nrf2 can, however, serve as a double-edged sword because some of the genes it induces may contribute to chemical carcinogenesis by promoting futile redox cycling of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites or confer resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs by increasing the expression of efflux pumps, suggesting its cytoprotective effects will vary in a context-specific fashion. In addition to cytoprotection, Nrf2 also controls genes involved in intermediary metabolism, positively regulating those involved in NADPH generation, purine biosynthesis, and the β-oxidation of fatty acids, while suppressing those involved in lipogenesis and . Nrf2 is subject to regulation at multiple levels. Its ability to orchestrate adaptation to oxidants and electrophiles is due principally to stress-stimulated modification of thiols within one of its repressors, the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which is present in the cullin-3 RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complex CRLKeap1. Thus modification of Cys residues in Keap1 blocks CRLKeap1 activity, allowing newly translated Nrf2 to accumulate rapidly and induce its target genes. The ability of Keap1 to repress Nrf2 can be attenuated by p62/sequestosome-1 in a mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent manner, thereby allowing refeeding after fasting to increase Nrf2-target gene expression. In parallel with repression by Keap1, Nrf2 is also repressed by β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP), present in the Skp1-cullin-1-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex SCFβ-TrCP. The ability of SCFβ-TrCP to suppress Nrf2 activity is itself enhanced by prior phosphorylation of the transcription factor by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) through formation of a DSGIS-containing phosphodegron. However, formation of the phosphodegron in Nrf2 by GSK-3 is inhibited by stimuli that activate protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt. In particular, PKB/Akt activity can be increased by phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mTORC2, thereby providing an explanation of why antioxidant-responsive element-driven genes are induced by growth factors and nutrients. Thus Nrf2 activity is tightly controlled via CRLKeap1 and SCFβ-TrCP by oxidative stress and energy-based signals, allowing it to mediate adaptive responses that restore redox homeostasis and modulate intermediary metabolism. Based on the fact that Nrf2 influences multiple biochemical pathways in both positive and negative ways, it is likely its dose-response curve, in terms of susceptibility to certain degenerative disease, is U-shaped. Specifically, too little Nrf2 activity will lead to loss of cytoprotection, diminished antioxidant capacity, and lowered β-oxidation of fatty acids, while conversely also exhibiting heightened sensitivity to ROS-based signaling that involves receptor  kinases and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1. By contrast, too much Nrf2 activity disturbs the homeostatic balance in favor of reduction, and so may have deleterious consequences including overproduction of reduced glutathione and NADPH, the blunting of ROS-based signal transduction, epithelial cell hyperplasia, and failure of certain cell types to differentiate correctly. We discuss the basis of a putative U-shaped Nrf2 dose-response curve in terms of potentially competing processes relevant to different stages of tumorigenesis.Copyright © 2015.
