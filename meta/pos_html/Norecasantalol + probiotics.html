However, the safety of  is not guaranteed, although the increasing widespread use of  with excellent overall safety records. Here, we performed a systematic evaluation of the safety of commercial Bacillus  intended for usage in humans, animals, plants, aquaculture and environment in China. Nearly half of the 65 isolated Bacillus spp. strains from these commercial probiotic products were capable of producing hazardous toxins. Infections with the representative isolates could cause sepsis, intestinal inflammation and liver injury in different mouse models. Additionally, these isolates harbor multiple antimicrobial resistance genes coupled with mobile genetic elements. Collectively, the capability for producing various toxins and harboring mobile antimicrobial resistance genes in Bacillus  indicates a potential risk for One Health.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, there is a need to strictly examine the biosafety as well as health benefits of  in vivo model system.In this study, two lactic acid bacterial (LAB) cultures Lactobacillus fermentum NCMR 2826 and FIX proven for their in vitro probiotic properties were investigated for their in vivo safety in Wistar rats. Acute toxicity study (14 days) with high dose of biomass (10  CFU/mL), followed by sub-chronic test for 13 weeks with oral feeding of the probiotic cultures in three different doses viz; 10, 10 and 10  CFU/mL on daily basis revealed the safety of the L. fermentum cultures. The probiotic feeding had no toxic effects on the survival, body weight, food consumption, with either of the dosage used throughout the treatment period. No statistically significant changes in relative organ weight, serum biochemical and hematological indices were found among the control and the probiotic fed animals. In addition to the safety attributes, the two L. fermentum cultures fed rats showed reduced serum cholesterol levels, macrovesicular steatosis and hepatocyte ballooning compared to control animals. Further, quantification of intestinal microbiota using real-time PCR analysis from animal feces indicated a significant increase and stability of Lactobacillus and bifidobacterial counts but a decrease of E. coli numbers.This study of safety and beneficial features highlight the use of the two native L. fermentum isolates as potential probiotic food supplements.

Treatment with  DSM 17938 (LR), a probiotic with immunomodulatory functions, significantly increases regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the intestinal mucosa of newborn suckling rats. In humans, treatment with LR of infants with colic reduces crying optimally if the infants are breast-fed. Therefore, we examined the effects of human breast milk (HBM) on LR-associated immune modulation.Newborn rats were divided into 8 feeding groups, including dam-fed ± LR (10 CFU/kg bw/day, daily), formula-fed ± LR, formula with 20% (v/v) HBM-fed ± LR, and HBM-fed ± LR. Pups were fed by gavage from d1 to d3 of age. Subsequently, we measured intestinal immune cell profiles, including Tregs and tolerogenic dendritic cells (tDCs) by flow cytometry. We also measured inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels of interleukin (IL)-1β and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattratant (CINC)-1 in intestinal tissue lysates by ELISA.(1) Formula feeding increased intestinal CD3+ T cells, CD4+ helper T (TH) cells and CD11c+ DCs, pro-inflammatory effects which were reversed by HBM. (2) When comparing HBM-fed with formula-fed newborns, HBM supplementation produced a lower percentage of CD4+ TH cells and a higher percentage of CD8+ (cytotoxic) T cells, while reducing protein levels of IL-1β and CINC-1 in the intestine. (3) Probiotic LR feeding maximally stimulated the percentage of intestinal Tregs and tDCs when the pups were fed HBM. In conclusion, HBM reduced formula-induced intestinal gut immune activation, and the addition of LR further promoted immune tolerance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555570>Effect of Synbiotic on the Treatment of Jaundice in Full Term Neonates: A Randomized Clinical Trial.</a></h2><p>Jaundice accounts for most hospital admissions in the neonatal period.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of  on the treatment of hyper-bilirubinemia in full-term neonates.In this randomized clinical trial, 83 full-term neonates, who were admitted to the hospital to receive phototherapy in the first 6 months of 2015, were randomly divided into two groups: synbiotic (SG, n=40) and control (CG, n=43). Both groups received phototherapy but the SG also received 5 drops/day of synbiotics. Serum bilirubin, urine, stool, feeding frequency, and weight were measured daily until hospital discharge. A -value<0.05 was considered statistically significant.The mean total serum bilirubin in the SG was lower than that in the CG (9.38±2.37 and 11.17±2.60 mg/dL, respectively). The urine and stool frequency in the SG was significantly higher than that in the CG (<0.05). The duration of hospitalization in the SG was shorter than that in the CG.Use of synbiotics as an adjuvant therapy had a significant treatment effect on jaundice in full-term neonates.

Probiotic administration has been suggested as a safe therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiometabolic disorders. This study was designed to assess the effects of probiotic Lactobacillus (L.) fermentum 296, a fruit-derived bacteria strain, against cardiometabolic disorders induced by HF diet.Male Wistar rats were divided into control diet (CTL); HF diet; and HF diet treated with Lactobacillus fermentum 296 (HF + Lf 296). The L. fermentum 296 strain at 1 × 10 colony forming units (CFU)/ml were daily administered by oral gavage for 4 weeks. The results showed that rats fed with HF diet displayed insulin resistance, reduced Lactobacillus spp. counts in feces, serum lipids, and oxidative profile. Rats fed on HF diet also demonstrated augmented blood pressure associated with sympathetic hyperactivity and impaired baroreflex control. The administration of L. fermentum 296 for 4 weeks recovered fecal Lactobacillus sp. counts and alleviated hyperlipidemia, sympathetic hyperactivity, and reduced systolic blood pressure in HF rats without affecting baroreflex sensibility.Our results suggest the ability of L. fermentum 296 improve biochemical and cardiovascular parameters altered in cardiometabolic disorders.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

In a systematic review of meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we considered nutritional interventions aimed at reducing the rates of infections, NEC, or mortality in very preterm infants. The overall effects of particular interventions were presented as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. In RCTs, pasteurized human donor milk, as opposed to formula, reduced NEC but not infections or mortality. No differences emerged between infants receiving human or bovine milk-based fortifiers. Pooled data of small trials and a recent large RCT suggested that bovine lactoferrin reduced rates of fungal sepsis without impact on other infections, NEC, or mortality. Pooled data of RCTs assessing the use of prebiotic oligosaccharides found reduced infection but not mortality. Enteral L-glutamine (six RCTs) lowered infection rates, and enteral L-arginine (three RCTs) reduced NEC. A meta-analysis sensitivity approach found multiple-strain (but not single-strain)  to be highly effective in reducing NEC and mortality.

However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in lipid metabolism that liver is the main site of lipid synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut microbiota and fat synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined  (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal microbiota diversity, altered short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed lipogenesis. In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. GLP-1 suppressed lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut microbiota on hepatic lipogenesis in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554647>Changes in the gut microbiota during and after commercial helium-oxygen saturation diving in China.</a></h2><p>The influence of commercial helium-oxygen saturation diving on divers' gut microbiotas was assessed to provide dietary suggestion.Faecal samples of 47 divers working offshore were collected before (T1), during (T2) and after (T3) saturation diving. Their living and excursion depths were 55-134 metres underwater with a saturation duration of 12-31 days and PaO of 38-65 kPa. The faecal samples were examined through 16S ribosomal DNA amplicon sequencing based on the Illumina sequencing platform to analyse changes in the bacteria composition in the divers' guts.Although the α and β diversity of the gut microbiota did not change significantly, we found that living in a hyperbaric environment of helium-oxygen saturation decreased the abundance of the genus , an obligate anaerobe, from 2.43%±3.83% at T1 to 0.79%±1.23% at T2 and 0.59%±0.79% at T3. Additionally, the abundance of some short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, such as , rectale group and , showed a decreased trend in the order of before, during and after diving.

Administration of  and prebiotics has been proposed as a convenient and effective treatment. Our study aims to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of  N1115 (N1115) and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) by examining the histopathogenesis and underlying molecular events of NAFLD.An NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding C57BL/6 mice with a high-fat diet (HFD). N1115, FOS and synbiotics were administered for 16 weeks.N1115, FOS and synbiotics alleviated HFD-induced hepatic steato-sis and release of tumor necrosis factor-α, and slowed the progression of cirrhosis. Compared to the HFD group, these dietary supplements reduced serum total triglyceride and cholesterol, and appeared to decrease the fasting blood glucose and insulin. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and real-time PCR showed that the regimens could overcome insulin resistance. These findings were associated with the transcriptional repression of inflammatory factors such as lipopolysaccharides, Toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor-κB. Lastly, N1115, FOS, and synbiotics improved the intestinal barrier functions and histologic integrity. This was accompanied by the restoration of the p38 MAPK pathway and in-creased expression of the tight junction components occludin-1 and claudin-1.N1115, FOS and synbiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.

Gliclazide is a drug characterized by large inter-individual differences in therapeutic response; however, the causes of these differences are not fully explained and may be the outcome of microbial biotransformation. Recently, great attention has been paid to studies on bile acid (BA) interactions with gut microflora and the role of BAs in the modification of drug transport through biological membranes.  Considering the assumption of gliclazide-probiotic-BAs interactions, the aim of the study was to investigate the transport and biotransformation of gliclazide in probiotic bacteria, as well as the effects of deoxycholic acid (DCA) on gliclazide transport into bacterial cells.   were incubated with gliclazide with or without DCA for 24 h at 37°C. The intracellular and extracellular concentrations of gliclazide were determined at seven time points by high-performance liquid chromatography. Gliclazide biotransformation by the enzymatic activity of probiotic bacteria was examined using appropriate software packages.  During the 24 h incubation with probiotic bacteria, significantly lower extracellular concentrations of gliclazide were observed at all time points compared to controls, while in the group with DCA, the decrease in concentration was noticed only at 24 h. The total concentration of gliclazide throughout the whole period was significantly lower compared to control. Proposed pathways of gliclazide biotransformation by probiotic bacteria involve reactions of hydrolysis and hydroxylation.  Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that there are interactions of gliclazide--DCA, at both the level of active and passive transport into the cells, and at the level of drug biotransformation by enzymatic activity of probiotic bacteria. The effect of these interactions on the final therapeutic response of gliclazide should be further studied and confirmed in  conditions.Copyright © 2019 Ðanić, Stanimirov, Pavlović, Vukmirović, Lazić, Al-Salami and Mikov.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587409>Transplant associated infections-The role of the gastrointestinal microbiota and potential therapeutic options.</a></h2><p>Infectious complications are common following kidney transplantation and rank in the top five causes of death in patients with allograft function.

In addition, neurobehavioral and emotional deficits following OP exposure have been reported. It would be of great value to discover a therapeutic strategy which produces a protective effect against these neurotoxic compounds. Moreover, a growing body of preclinical data suggests that the microbiota may affect metabolism and neurotoxic outcomes through exposure to OPs. The human gut is colonised by a broad variety of microorganisms. This huge number of bacteria and other microorganisms which survive by colonising the gastrointestinal tract is defined as "gut microbiota". The gut microbiome plays a profound role in metabolic processing, energy production, immune and cognitive development and homeostasis. The effects are not only localized in the gut, but also influence many other organs, such as the brain through the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Therefore, given the gut microbiota's key role in host homeostasis, this microbiota may be altered or modified temporarily by factors such as antibiotics, diet and toxins such as pesticides. The aim of this review is to examine scientific articles concerning the impact of microbiota in OP toxicity. Studies focussed on the possible contribution the microbiota has on variable host pharmacokinetic responses such as absorption and biotransformation of xenobiotics will be evaluated.

Antagonistic strains were identified by mass spectrometry, and the16S rDNAs were sequenced, and their best bacteriostatic concentrations and antagonistic spectra for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter Baumanii, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pyogenes were evaluated.Of 300 isolated α-hemolytic bacterial clones, four exhibited bacteriostatic activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Mass spectrometric analyses revealed that two of them were Streptococcus mitis and two others were Streptococcus parasanguinis strains. Further tests showed that all 4 antagonistic strains also had bacteriostatic effects on Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter cloacae, and Acinetobacter Baumanii, and the mode of action was not mediated by lactic acid production.Four antagonistic Streptococcus strains derived from oropharyngeal microbiotas showed bacteriostatic effects on pathogens and may be involved in pharyngeal microbiome homeostasis.© 2019 The Authors.

At present, albendazole and benzimidazole are the most commonly used therapeutic drugs for the clinical treatment of trichinellosis, but they have many side effects. Sanguinarine is a benzophenanthridine alkaloid that has biological activity, such as antibacterial, antitumour and antiparasitic activities. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the anti-Trichinella effect of sanguinarine in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that sanguinarine had a lethal effect on muscle larvae, adults and new-borne larvae in vitro. The damage to adults treated with sanguinarine was observed by scanning electron microscopy. Sanguinarine could significantly reduce the burden of worms in mice during the pre-adult, migrating larva and encysted larva stages. The ratio of intestinal villus to crypt (V/C) in mice treated with sanguinarine was significantly higher than that in non-treated control mice. Compared with the non-treated control group, the sanguinarine-treated group exhibited a significantly increased number of small intestine goblet cells. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the serum of mice treated with sanguinarine was significantly higher than that of the control group mice in the pre-adult and encysted larva stages. This study suggests that sanguinarine is a potential drug against trichinellosis.Copyright © 2019.

Moreover, FMT consists of a broad mixture, which could be beneficial, because at this moment it is not known what type of changes in the microbiome are needed. However, except from a few cases no clinical data in PD is available yet. There is some indication that FMT might be beneficial in severe constipated patients, but the clinical data to support this are very scarce. So, actually there are no good data in the public domain to support FMT at this moment in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. FMT at this moment is a black box with too many unanswered questions, also with respect to safety concerns. Administration of species of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium over a time period of four to twelve weeks has repeatedly proven to be effective in treating constipation in PD. However, no solid clinical data are available about the possible effects of probiotic treatment on motor symptoms or progression of PD. Therefore, also probiotic treatments in PD should wait until better clinical data become available, in order to select the right target populations and to have good estimates of the clinical effects to be expected.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572693>The Need to Focus on Therapy Instead of Associations.</a></h2><p>Molecular analyses of the vaginal microbiota have uncovered a vast array of organisms in this niche, but not so far changed what has been known for a long time: lactobacilli are dominant in health, and the diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic bacterial vaginosis is sub-optimal, and has not changed for over 40 years. While the lowering cost of DNA sequencing has attracted more researchers to the field, and bioinformatics, and statistical tools have made it possible to produce large datasets, it is functional and actionable studies that are more urgently needed, not more microbial abundance, and health or disease-associative data. The triggers of dysbiosis remain to be identified, but ultimately treatment will require disrupting biofilms of primarily anaerobic bacteria and replacing them with the host's own lactobacilli, or health-promoting organisms. The options of using probiotic strains to displace the biofilms and for prebiotics to encourage resurgence of the indigenous lactobacilli hold great promise, but more researchers need to develop, and test these concepts in humans. The enormity of the problem of vaginal dysbiosis cannot be understated. It should not take another 40 years to offer better management options.Copyright © 2019 Reid.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659451>Anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047 on high-fat and high-fructose diet mice base on inflammatory response alleviation and gut microbiota regulation.</a></h2><p>The objective of the study was to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047, and illustrate the potential functional mechanism about the alleviation of high fat and high fructose diet (HFFD) induced obesity and related metabolic abnormalities.C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a standard or HFFD with or without supplementation of L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 for 10 weeks. Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two  can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613203> strains of dairy-product origin adhere to mucin and survive digestive juices.</a></h2><p> There is an ever present need to isolate and characterize indigenous bacterial strains with potential probiotic health benefits for humans.  of dairy origin was focused because of its propensity to adhere to the intestinal glycoprotein, mucin. The lactobacillus strains were screened for mucin adhesion, resistance to low pH and bile, autoaggregation, hydrophobicity, and survival in an  digestion model. The cholesterol-lowering and oxalate-degrading effects of selected strains were also determined. Safety was assessed for haemolytic, mucinolytic and gelatinase activity, biogenic amine production, antibiotic resistance and phenol resistance. Expression of the 32-mmub adhesion-related gene was also measured following strain exposure to simulated gastrointestinal tract (GIT) digestion. The selected mucin-adhesive strains were tolerant to acid (pH 3.0) and bile (0.25 %) and demonstrated >85 % survival following simulated human digestion in the presence of milk. The digestive treatment did not affect the adhesive potential of PL20, and PL27, regardless of the food matrix. The simulated digestion had less effect on their adhesion than on the type strain and it also did not correlate with the mmub gene expression level as determined by qPCR. The selected strains exhibited cholesterol removal (36-44 %) and degraded oxalate (66-55 %). Neither of these strains exhibited undesirable characteristics. These preliminary findings suggest a functionality in the two strains of  with high colonization potential on GIT mucosal membranes and possible health-promoting effects. This prima facie evidence suggests the need for further studies to test these probiotic candidates as live biotherapeutic agents .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563774>Bacillus coagulans R11 maintained intestinal villus health and decreased intestinal injury in lead-exposed mice by regulating the intestinal microbiota and influenced the function of faecal microRNAs.</a></h2><p>Lead contamination is an environmental problem, especially in developing countries; due to the nondegradable characteristics of lead, it is easily deposited in human and animal bodies by the food chain.  are regarded as a good tool to remove lead ions in the intestine and maintain gut health conditions, but previous studies failed to elucidate the relationship among , the host and the gut microbiota. In the present study, B. coagulans R11 was employed as the "lead removal tool" in lead-exposed mouse, and the effects of B. coagulans R11 on intestinal cells, the microbiota and faecal microRNAs were tested. The results indicated that B. coagulans R11 had no negative effects on mouse intestine model cells and helped keep cells in a normal proliferation ratio and reduce the reactive oxygen species and apoptosis ratios under lead exposure conditions. An in vivo mouse experiment also showed that B. coagulans R11 feeding could reduce the intestinal villi damage caused by lead through adjusting the microbiota structure and function, such as increasing the genus abundance of Akkermansia and Alistipes, decreasing the genus abundance of Alloprevotella, Lachnospiraceae, Parabacteroides and Ruminiclostridium, and keeping the protein dltD existing. Host faecal microRNAs may be influenced by lead and B. coagulans R11, which may change the microbiota structure. Thus, B. coagulans R11 has the potential to be developed and considered as the probiotic that protects the host gut against villi damage and gut microbiota structure and function disorders during lead exposure.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Subsequently, microcapsules were dried by freeze drying. The encapsulation efficiency, morphology, thermal resistance, gastrointestinal simulation and storage stability were analysed for wet and dry forms. The treatments offered high encapsulation efficiency (68.20-97.72%). Transglutaminase maintained the structure rounded, multinucleate and homogeneous distribution of  in the microcapsules. In relation to the thermal resistance, in general, microencapsulation was effective in protecting and crosslinked microcapsules demonstrated greater protection for , obtaining viable cell counts of up to 10 log CFU g, approximately. On exposure to the simulated gastrointestinal tract, microencapsulation coupled to crosslinking demonstrated good results and the dry form was more efficient in the protection and the treatment with greater amount of transglutaminase was highlighted (9.07 log CFU g). As for storage, probiotic viability was maintained for up to 60 days in freezing temperature, with counts of up to 9.59 log CFU g.

Notably, factors such as excessive food consumption, a sedentary way of life, high sugar consumption, a fat-rich diet, and a certain genetic profile may lead to obesity. The present review brings together recent advances regarding the significance of interventions involving intestinal gut bacteria and host metabolic phenotypes. We assess important biological molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of gut microbiota on hosts including bile salt metabolism, short-chain fatty acids, and metabolic endotoxemia. Some previous studies have shown a link between microbiota and obesity, and associated disease reports have been documented. Thus, this review focuses on obesity and gut microbiota interactions and further develops the mechanism of the gut microbiome approach related to human obesity. Specifically, we highlight several alternative diet treatments including dietary changes and supplementation with . The future direction or comparative significance of fecal transplantation, synbiotics, and metabolomics as an approach to the modulation of intestinal microbes is also discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604151>Lactobacillus fermentum and/or ferulic acid improved the immune responses, antioxidative defence and resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) fingerlings.</a></h2><p>This study investigates the possible effects of using Lactobacillus fermentum (LF) and/or ferulic acid (FA) in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) on some immunological parameters as well as resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila. Four diets were prepared including control diet and three diets supplemented with LF (10 CFU/g), FA (100 mg kg) or LF + FA (10 CFU/g + 100 mg kg). After 8 weeks, fish fed LF or/and FA had significantly higher final body weight, weight gain, and specific growth rate when compared to control group (P < 0.05). The feed conversion ratio of fish fed LF or/and FA were noticeably lower than control (P < 0.05). No alterations were observed in case of haematological parameters except red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), hemoglobin (Hb), and hematocrit (HCT) which were significantly (P < 0.05) increased in fish fed FA or those fed both LF and FA. Also, the WBCs of fish treated with LF or/and FA were noticeably higher than control (P < 0.05). Feeding on LF and FA notably increased the serum total protein and albumin levels (P < 0.05). The serum respiratory burst and lysozyme activity were also enhanced (P < 0.05) in fish fed both LF or/and FA. In addition, evaluation of the serum antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD)) activity showed significant (P < 0.05) increase in fish fed FA or both LF and FA as compared to the control. Fish fed LF and FA supplemented diet had highest survival rate after experimental challenge with pathogenic A. hydrophila. The obtained results revealed that LF and/or FA can be used as beneficial feed additive to improve the immune responses and disease resistance in early stages of common carp culture.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Perioperative  can decrease length of stay and lower rates of infectious complications. We assessed whether perioperative  decrease major complications among patients undergoing high-risk gastrointestinal operations in a pragmatic randomized trial.This double-blind trial randomized 135 patients undergoing elective major gastrointestinal operations to perioperative oral probiotic VSL#3 taken just before operation and twice daily up to 15 total doses (n = 67) or placebo (n = 68). The primary outcomes measure was 30-day composite end point of death, unplanned readmission, or any infection.Primary end point occurred among 17 patients in the placebo group (25.0%) vs 22 patients in the probiotic group (32.8%; p = 0.315). Thirty-day mortality was 2 (2.9%) in the placebo group compared with 1 (1.5%) in the probiotic group (p = 1.000). The placebo group patients experienced lower 30-day readmission rate (3 of 68 [4.4%]) compared with the probiotic group (11 of 67 [16.4%]; p = 0.022).

For many years, the lung was considered a sterile environment, and only recently, with the use of more sophisticated techniques, has it been demonstrated that colonization by a complex population of microorganisms in lower airways also occurs in healthy subjects; a predominance of some species of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes phyla and with a peculiar composition in some disease conditions, such as asthma, have been noted. Lung microbiota derives mainly from the higher airways microbiota. Although we have some information about the role of gut microbiota in modulation of immune system, less it is known about the connection between lung microbiota and local and systemic immunity. There is a correlation between altered microbiota composition and some diseases or chronic states; however, despite this correlation, it has not been clearly demonstrated whether the lung microbiota dysbiosis could be a consequence or a cause of these diseases. We are far from a scientific approach to the therapeutic use of  in airway diseases, but we are only at the starting point of a knowledge process in this fascinating field that could reveal important surprises, and randomized prospective studies in future could reveal more about the clinical possibilities for controlling lung microbiota.

This work aimed to study the impact of the addition of two probiotic lactobacilli (L. rhamnosus GG and L. acidophilus LA5), either individually or combined, on the physicochemical and sensory characteristics of pasta filata soft cheeses and to evaluate the immunomodulating capacity of the product using an in vivo model. Four cheese types were produced: CC (control cheese); L-C (added with L. acidophilus LA5); GG-C (added with L. rhamnosus GG) and GGL-C (added with both ). No differences in gross composition were found. An increase in secondary proteolysis was observed in GGL-C cheeses which correlated with a greater bitter and aftertaste. On the contrary, the L-C cheese received the highest overall quality score. The translocation assay was negative. Moreover, the three experimental cheeses were able to modulate the immune system of mice by reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the intestine, downregulating the levels of interleukin (IL)-10 and increasing the secretion of Secretory Immunoglobulin A (S-IgA).

The uses and benefits of Lactobacilli as , particularly the regulation of immune system, are dependent on the strain used and a comprehensive understanding of their effects on the host. Several factors have been identified in Lactobacilli that influence the immune response, such as exopolysaccharides and proteins. The current study was designed to investigate the serum immunoreactivity of healthy women against common vaginal Lactobacilli immunoreactive proteins. Three common vaginal Lactobacillus strains (L. crispatus L1, L. gasseri L9, and L. fermentum L2) were compared for immune response. The ELISA results showed that the levels of total immunoglobulin (Ig-total) antibody for L. crispatus L1, L. fermentum L2, and L. gasseri L9 were 47%, 45% and 29%, respectively. Regarding the lower prevalence of L. fermentum L2 in comparison with the other two strains, the approximately equal levels of Ig-total compared to L. crispatus L1 and more than L. gasseri L9 indicate that L. fermentum L2 has the greater antigenicity ability. Accordingly, the immunoreactive proteins of L. fermentum L2 were identified using MALDI-TOF-MS detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. These proteins included 30s ribosomal protein S4 and 50s ribosomal protein L5. Antigenic epitopes on the 3D structure of these proteins was also predicted using bioinformatics analysis. The presence of antibody in serum of healthy pre-menopausal women indicates that Lactobacilli (normal flora) proteins can stimulate host immune response. Purification and further studies of the proteins may allow their potential use as an adjuvant to improve the efficacy of vaccines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613980>[The Role of Gut Microbiota in Autism Spectrum Disorder].</a></h2><p>Human microbiota are colonies of microorganisms located in different parts of the human body with diverse functions. Healthy gut microbiota comprises differing ratios of microoganisms wholly contributing to metabolic and other molecular reactions in a healthy, functioning body. After the demonstration of the bidirectional interaction between the central nervous system and gut microbiota through neuroendocrine, neuroimmune, and autonomic nervous mechanisms, investigations have been started on the microbiota-gut-brain axis in psychiatric disorders. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is a neurodevelopmental disorder of early childhood, is one of these disorders. Most of such studies were cross-sectional and mainly investigated the bacterial species. Changes in gut microbiota composition and the leaky gut syndrome are some of the hypotheses proposed to explain the core symptoms and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms of ASD. , prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, diet have been proposed as treatment options. However, the role of microbiota in diagnosis, followup, and treatment is not yet clear. The bidirectional interaction between central nervous system and intestinal microbiota makes it difficult to establish the cause-effect relationship.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of probiotic supplement on one or more of the following in GDM were included: pregnancy outcome (the primary outcome), glycemic control, blood lipid profile, and inflammation and oxidative stress. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in studies. Meta-analysis was conducted by using the fixed effects model unless substantial heterogeneity was found among studies.Eleven randomized trials involving 719 participants were included for analysis. Eight of the trials were from Iran.  were given alone in eight trials and synbiotics in three trials. Though the components of  varied, Lactobacillus was included in all trials and Bifidobacterium in all except one. The duration of intervention ranged from 4 to 8 weeks. Almost all trials (10/11) had a low risk of bias. Probiotic supplementation reduced the risk of a newborn's hyperbilirubinemia by 74% and improved four biomarkers for glycemic control (fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance, and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index), two biomarkers for lipid profile (triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol), and four biomarkers for inflammation and oxidative stress (total glutathione, malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, and total antioxidant capacity). But significant heterogeneity was observed in the meta-analyses on the four biomarkers related to glycemic control and on triglycerides, which could not be explained by prespecified subgroup analyses according to the mean age of participants and intervention type (i.e.,  or synbiotics). The effects on the risk of preterm delivery, macrosomia and a newborns' hypoglycemia, gestational age, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol were not statistically significant.Probiotic supplementation seemed to be able to reduce the risk of a newborn's hyperbilirubinemia and improve glycemic control, blood lipid profiles and inflammation and oxidative stress in pregnant women with GDM. However, due to the heterogeneity among existing studies, the surrogate nature of outcomes, and/or the fact that most studies were from Iran, the clinical significance and generalizability of the above findings remain uncertain. Further studies are warranted to address the limitations of existing evidence and better inform the management of GDM.Copyright © 2019 Jiayue Zhang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614427> Can Cure Oral Aphthous-Like Ulcers in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Review of the Literature and a Working Hypothesis.</a></h2><p>Dysbiosis has been associated with the onset of several chronic autoimmune or inflammatory pathologies (e.g., inflammatory bowel diseases-IBD), because of its primary role in the establishment of a chronic inflammatory process leading to tissue damage. Inflammatory bowel diseases can even involve areas far away from the gut, such as the extraintestinal manifestations involving the oral cavity with the onset of aphthous-like ulcers (ALU). Studies carried out on animal models have shown that intestinal dysbiosis may be related to the development of autoimmune diseases, even if the mechanisms involved are not yet well known. The aim of this paper is to verify the hypothesis that in inflammatory bowel diseases patients, aphthous-like ulcers are the result of the concomitance of intestinal dysbiosis and other events, e.g., the microtraumas, occurring in the oral mucosa, and that  therapy with  can be employed to modify the natural course of the aphthous-like ulcers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566009>Naturopathic Oncology Care for Pediatric Cancers: A Practice Survey.</a></h2><p> The majority of pediatric oncology patients report use of complementary and alternative medicine. Some naturopathic doctors (NDs) provide supportive pediatric oncology care; however, little information exists to formally describe this clinical practice. A survey was conducted with members of the Oncology Association of Naturopathic Physicians (OncANP.org) to describe recommendations across four therapeutic domains: natural health products (NHPs), nutrition, physical medicine, and mental/emotional support.  We had 99 respondents with a wide variance of clinical experience and aptitude to treat children with cancer. Of the majority (52.5%) of respondents who choose not to treat these children, the three primary reasons for this are lack of public demand (45.1%), institutional or clinic restrictions (21.6%), and personal reasons/comfort (19.6%). The 10 most frequently considered NHPs by all NDs are fish-derived omega-3 fatty acid (83.3%), vitamin D (83.3%),  (82.1%), melatonin (73.8%), vitamin C (72.6%), homeopathic Arnica (69.0%), turmeric/curcumin (67.9%), glutamine (66.7%),  (64.3%), and  (polysaccharide K) extracts (61.9%). The top 5 nutritional recommendations are anti-inflammatory diets (77.9%), dairy restriction (66.2%), Mediterranean diet (66.2%), gluten restriction (61.8%), and ketogenic diet (57.4%). The top 5 physical modality interventions are exercise (94.1%), acupuncture (77.9%), acupressure (72.1%), craniosacral therapy (69.1%), and yoga (69.1%). The top 5 mental/emotional interventions are meditation (79.4%), art therapy (77.9%), mindfulness-based stress reduction (70.6%), music therapy (70.6%), and visualization therapy (67.6%).  The results of our clinical practice survey highlight naturopathic interventions across four domains with a strong rationale for further inquiry in the care of children with cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566046>Gut microbiota and health.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602222>Efficacy of electroacupuncture combined with  for depression and chronic diarrhea in patients and effect on serum inflammatory cytokines, NE and BDNF.</a></h2><p>Efficacy of electroacupuncture combined with  for depression and chronic diarrhea in patients, and its effect on the levels of serum inflammatory cytokines, norepinephrine (NE) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were investigated. A total of 104 patients with depression and chronic diarrhea admitted to The First Clinical Faculty, Guangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine from July 2014 to June 2018 were randomly divided into the observation group (n=56) and the control group (n=48). The observation group was treated with electroacupuncture combined with , and the control group was given conventional drugs for depression and chronic diarrhea. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score and the abdominal symptom score were evaluated before treatment and at 3 weeks after treatment. Changes in the levels of serum inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α] as well as the levels of NE and BDNF in the two groups of patients before and after treatment were determined using radioimmunoassay. Compared with those in the control group, the symptoms of depression and diarrhea in the observation group were remarkably alleviated (p<0.05). After treatment, the serum cytokine levels in the two groups of patients were decreased, and the decreased level of serum inflammatory cytokines in the observation group was not obviously different from that in the control group. Besides, the serum BDNF level in the observation group was also reduced (p<0.05). The overall efficacy of the observation group was superior to that of the control group, showing a statistical difference.

Ltd., Sapporo, Japan). BB536 and AHCC may modulate T cell and dendritic cell (DC) phenotypes, and cytokine profiles to favour anti-inflammatory responses following antibiotic ingestion. We tested the hypothesis that orally administered BB536 and/or AHCC, results in modulation of immune effector cells with polarisation towards anti-inflammatory responses following antibiotic usage. Forty healthy male volunteers divided into 4 equal groups were randomised to receive either placebo, BB536, AHCC or a combination for 12 days in a double-blind manner. After 7 days volunteers also received 250 mg azithromycin for 5 days. Cytokine profiles from purified CD3+ T cells stimulated with PDB-ionomycin were assessed. CD4+ CD25+ forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) expression and peripheral blood DC subsets were assessed prior to treatment and subsequently at 7 and 13 days. There was no difference in cytokine secretion from stimulated CD3+ T cells between treatment groups. Compared with baseline, Foxp3 expression (0.45 ± 0.1 vs. 1.3 ± 0.4;  = 0.002) and interferon-gamma/interleukin-4 (IFN-γ/IL-4) ratios were increased post-treatment in volunteers receiving BB536 ( = 0.031), although differences between groups were not significant. For volunteers receiving combination BB536 and AHCC, there was an increase in myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) compared with plasmacytoid DC (pDC) counts (80% vs. 61%;  = 0.006) at post treatment time points. mDC2 phenotypes were more prevalent, compared with baseline, following combination treatment (0.16% vs. 0.05%;  = 0.002).

Information was collected on family history of allergic diseases, household size, socioeconomic status, delivery mode, antibiotic and probiotic use, exposure to fermented and unpasteurised milk, antihelminth treatment, sunlight exposure, pet and farm animal exposure, cigarette smoke and household cooking and heating fuels. Antenatal exposures to pets, livestock and cigarette smoke was assessed. A subsection completed questions on consumption of fruit/vegetables, fast foods, soft drinks/fruit juices and fried/microwaved meat.Risk and protective factors differed between urban and rural settings. Exposure to farm animals in infants and their mothers during pregnancy was protective against allergic outcomes in the rural population. Consumption of unpasteurised milk is uncommon in this group of rural children and is unlikely to be an important factor in rural protection. In urban children birth by caesarean section is associated with food allergy and consumption of fermented milk products is associated with reduced asthma and atopic dermatitis. In both cohorts antenatal maternal smoking and environmental smoking exposure were predominantly associated with asthma and consumption of fast foods and fried meat were associated with allergy.In this rural environment exposure to livestock is the strongest protective factor. In urban communities, where animal contact is rare, risk factors include caesarian section and protective factors include consumption of fermented milk products. Modifiable risk factors urgently require interventions to prevent increasing allergies in countries undergoing rapid urbanization.Copyright © 2019.

We conducted a meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety associated with probiotic treatment for BV.We searched multiple databases covering up to 1 March 2018. Studies published as blinded randomized controlled trials (RCTs), comparing treatment using probiotic versus active or placebo control in BV patients were included, with at least one-month follow-up. Random effects model and trial sequential analysis (TSA) were applied.Ten studies ( = 2321) were included. Compared with placebo, the -only therapy resulted in a beneficial outcome both in clinical cure rate at the 30th day (risk ratio, RR = 2.57; 95% confidential interval, 95% CI: 1.96 to 3.37), and Nugent score (mean difference, MD = -2.71; 95% CI: 3.41 to -2.00). This effect decreased but remained significant after eight weeks. -post-antibiotics therapy had a decreased effect only for a short term and possibly among studies with a mostly black study population. No extra adverse events were observed. The TSA suggested a larger sample size for effective evaluation of the  as a supplementary remedy.Probiotic regimes are safe and may exhibit a short-term and long-term beneficial effect for BV treatment.

Frequent acute exacerbations of COPD are sudden worsening of symptoms, the nature of which is associated with bacterial or viral infections. However, one-third of exacerbations remain of undetermined origin. Although it is largely discussed and controversial, current guidelines recommend treatment of exacerbations with bronchodilators, antibiotics, and systemic corticosteroids; this is despite being associated with limited benefits in term of reducing mortality, side effects and without paying attention to the heterogeneity of these exacerbations. Increasing evidence suggests that the lung microbiota plays an important role in COPD and numerous studies have reported differences in the microbiota between healthy and disease states, as well as between exacerbations and stable COPD, leading to the hypothesis that frequent acute exacerbation is more likely to experience significant changes in lung microbiota composition. These findings will need further examination to explain the causes of lung dysbiosis, namely microbial composition, the host response, including the recruitment of eosinophils, lifestyle, diet, cigarette smoking and the use of antibiotics and corticosteroids. It is now important to assess: 1) Whether alterations in the lung microbiota contribute to disease pathogenesis, especially in exacerbations of unknown origin; 2) The role of eosinophils; and 3) Whether the microbiota of the lung can be manipulated therapeutically to improve COPD exacerbation event and disease progression. In summary, we hypothesize that the alterations of the lung microbiota may explain the undetermined origins of exacerbations and that there is an urgent need to facilitate the design of intervention studies that aim at conserving the lung microbial flora.Copyright 2019, Toraldo et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645008>Pretreatment of Pennisetum sinese silages with ferulic acid esterase-producing lactic acid bacteria and cellulase at two dry matter contents: Fermentation characteristics, carbohydrates composition and enzymatic saccharification.</a></h2><p>The impact of Lactobacillus plantarum A1 producing ferulic acid esterase and Acremonium cellulase on Pennisetum sinese silages was investigated at two dry matter contents by studying the ensiling characteristics, lignocellulosic degradation and enzymatic saccharification properties.

PD involves degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNPC) with deficiency of dopamine. Genetic factors like SNCA, PARK-2, PARK-7, PINK-1 and LRRK-2 as well as environmental toxins enhance alpha-synuclein, amyloid β (beta) and τ (tau) proteins aggregation. Moreover, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunctioning, neuroinflammation, prion like phenomena, excitotoxicity, mutations etc are known to cause pathological insult in PD. Recently, facts indicates strong correlation between gut-brain axis and PD. The communication between the gastrointestinal system (GIT) and central nervous system is bidirectional and it is hypothesized that PD arises in the gut and spreads to brain via vagus nerve that helps to propagate the alpha-synuclein that target brain. The Lewy bodies are found in olfactory bulb, dorsal motor vagal nerve and the ENS of the gut indicate peripheral and central correlation. The alteration of gut microbial flora leads to GIT disturbance which cause neuroinflammation by prion alpha-synuclein expression and produces PD like symptoms. Persistent gut inflammation with spontaneous neuroinflammation is yet need to confirm but increased intestinal permeability and disrupt function of GIT is known to produce non-motor symptoms of PD. The present review is aimed to explore mechanistic approach for gut associated PD symptoms as well as use of  and prebiotics as therapeutic approach to retain gut microbial flora and prevent PD like symptoms.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

At the genus level, abundance levels of Desulfovibrionaceae sp., Oscillospira, and Bacteroides were high in mice fed the CT diet. At the operational taxonomic unit level, Bacteroides acidifaciens- and Bacteroides caecimuris-like bacteria were highly abundant in mice fed the CT diet. Faecalibaculum rodentium- and Allobaculum stercoricanis-like bacteria were highly abundant in the mice fed the Egg diet. These sets of taxa were assumed to be estimates of casein-tallow SIBs and egg SIBs, respectively, in the gut microbiome. Among the SIBs, B. caecimuris and F. rodentium could be isolated using blood and liver agar. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: B. caecimuris and F. rodentium are regarded as casein-tallow and/or egg SIBs in mice. It is possible to demonstrate functionality with orally administered food ingredients.

The diversity of human gut microbiota has been correlated with aging, which was characterized by different abundance of bacteria in various age groups. In the literature, most of the previous studies of age-related gut microbiota changes focused on individual species in the gut community with supervised methods. Here, we aimed to examine the underlying aging progression of the human gut microbial community from an unsupervised perspective.We obtained raw 16S rRNA sequencing data of subjects ranging from newborns to centenarians from a previous study, and summarized the data into a relative abundance matrix of genera in all the samples. Without using the age information of samples, we applied an unsupervised algorithm to recapitulate the underlying aging progression of microbial community from hosts in different age groups and identify genera associated to this progression. Literature review of these identified genera indicated that for individuals with advanced ages, some beneficial genera are lost while some genera related with inflammation and cancer increase.The multivariate unsupervised analysis here revealed the existence of a continuous aging progression of human gut microbiota along with the host aging process. The identified genera associated to this aging process are meaningful for designing  to maintain the gut microbiota to resemble a young age, which hopefully will lead to positive impact on human health, especially for individuals in advanced age groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654515>Human microbiome and allergic diseases in children: pathogenetic role and therapeutic options.</a></h2><p>The recent and extensive study of the microbiome has provided an enormous amount of data concerning the type and possible functions of microorganisms present in the gut, airways, genital tract, and skin. These data showed interpersonal differences in the composition of the microbiome and these differences suggest a link between the microbiome, the immune modulation, and the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. This research is particularly relevant in paediatrics, since allergic diseases are constantly increasing and there is evidence in the paediatric age that shows that the composition of the microbiome in the foetal and neonatal period plays a key role in the development of the immune system: vaginal delivery, breastfeeding, childhood spent in rural environments and/or in contact with animals result in a greater biodiversity of the microbiome with the presence of protective species that reduce the activation of Th2 lymphocytes, involved in allergic reactions. Further studies are necessary to better understand the microbiota role in the pathogenesis of atopy in order to understand if specific  and prebiotics, administered orally or topically, can affect the microbiota composition and modulate immune system functions, producing a therapeutic effect in the treatment of allergic diseases. This narrative review analysed the available literature regarding the correlation between the microbiome and the development of allergic diseases and with special focus on paediatric studies. The skin, gut or lung dysbiosis can be a cofactor in the pathogenesis of allergies and the remodulation of the microbiome becomes an important therapeutic challenge.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615039>Effect of  on Oral Candidiasis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>Oral candidiasis (OC) is an increasing health problem due to the introduction of new drugs, population aging, and increasing prevalence of chronic illness.

This study assessed the effects of different concentrations of quercetin (QUE) and resveratrol (RES) on the ability of six potentially probiotic  strains to tolerate different pH values and bile salt concentrations, to autoaggregate, coaggregate with and antagonize pathogens and survive the exposure to simulated gastrointestinal conditions. QUE and RES presented low inhibitory effects on all tested  strains, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 512 to >1024 μg/mL. In most cases, QUE and RES at all tested concentrations (i.e., MIC, 1/2 MIC, and 1/4 MIC) did not affect the tolerance of the  strains to acidic pH and bile salts. QUE increased cell surface hydrophobicity of most of the tested  strains and increases or decreases in cell surface hydrophobicity varied in the presence of different RES concentrations among some strains. QUE and RES increased the ability of tested  strains to autoaggregate and coaggregate with pathogens. QUE and RES did not negatively affect the antagonistic activity of the tested  strains against pathogens and did not decrease their survival rates when exposed to  gastrointestinal conditions. In a few cases, the ability of some tested  strains to antagonize pathogens, as well as to survive specific steps of the  digestion was increased by QUE and RES. QUE exerted overall better protective effects on the measured  properties of tested  strains than RES, and  and  strains presented better responses when treated with QUE or RES. These results showed that probiotic  strains could present low susceptibility to QUE and RES. Combined use of QUE and RES with probiotic  could improve their functionalities on the host; however, the concentration of these polyphenols should be carefully selected to achieve the desirable effects and vary according to the selected probiotic strain.Copyright © 2019 dos Santos, de Albuquerque, de Brito Alves and de Souza.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661976>Effects of phytogenic feed additives,  and mannan-oligosaccharides on performance, blood metabolites, meat quality, intestinal morphology, and microbial population of Japanese quail.</a></h2><p>1.

A total of 375 one-day-old Japanese quail were randomly allocated into five treatment groups with five replicates of 15 birds each for a 42 d feeding experiment. The dietary treatments were a basal diet (control) or the same diet supplemented with PRO (0.15 g/kg feed), MOS (2 g/kg feed), AEO (0.25 g/kg feed) or DEO (0.25 g/kg feed).3. AEO, MOS, and PRO supplementation increased weight gain, while diets supplemented with AEO decreased FI, and improved feed conversion ratio from d 1 to 21 (P<0.05). The relative weight of the gizzard was higher in birds supplemented with AEO compared to control group, while the birds fed MOS diet had the longest intestine (P<.05). Ceca length was greater in control, MOS and PRO groups (P<.05). Both essential oils decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration of breast meat and percentage of cooking loss in quail (P<.05). The villus length (VL) was greater in birds fed diet supplemented with MOS, AEO, and DEO (P<.05).The population of  decreased in Japanese quail fed MOS, while . count was increased in the MOS group (P<.05).4. In conclusion, AEO, MOS, and PRO supplementation exhibited a positive effect on growth performance, while lipid peroxidation of the meat decreased in birds fed AEO and DEO diets. The intestinal morphometric indices increased in quail fed the AEO, MOS, and DEO diets.

GG, which is a representative commercial probiotic, was used as a comparative sample. Regarding probiotic properties,  KCCM 12203P was resistant to 0.3% pepsin with a pH of 2.5 for 3 h and 0.3% oxgall solution for 24 h, having approximately a 99% survival rate. It also showed strong adhesion activity (6.84%) onto HT-29 cells and did not produce β-glucuronidase but produced high quantities of leucine arylamidase, valine arylamidase, β-galactosidase, and -acetyl-β-glucosaminidase. For antioxidant activity, it appeared that viable cells had higher radical scavenging activity in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assay, while in the 2-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) assay, heat-killed cells had higher antioxidant activity. Additionally,  KCCM 12203P showed higher lipid oxidation inhibition ability than  GG; however, there was no significant difference ( < 0.05) between heat-killed cells and control cells. Furthermore, heat-killed  KCCM 12203P activated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells without cytotoxicity at a concentration lower than 10 CFU/ml and promoted higher gene expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 than  GG. These results suggest that noble  KCCM 12203P could be used as a probiotic or applied to functional food processing and pharmaceutical fields for immunocompromised people.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649546>Inflammation in Renal Diseases: New and Old Players.</a></h2><p>Inflammation, a process intimately linked to renal disease, can be defined as a complex network of interactions between renal parenchymal cells and resident immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, coupled with recruitment of circulating monocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. Once stimulated, these cells activate specialized structures such as Toll-like receptor and Nod-like receptor (NLR). By detecting danger-associated molecules, these receptors can set in motion major innate immunity pathways such as nuclear factor ĸB (NF-ĸB) and NLRP3 inflammasome, causing metabolic reprogramming and phenotype changes of immune and parenchymal cells and triggering the secretion of a number of inflammatory mediators that can cause irreversible tissue damage and functional loss. Growing evidence suggests that this response can be deeply impacted by the crosstalk between the kidneys and other organs, such as the gut. Changes in the composition and/or metabolite production of the gut microbiota can influence inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, thus offering opportunities to positively manipulate the composition and/or functionality of gut microbiota and, consequentially, ameliorate deleterious consequences of renal diseases. In this review, we summarize the most recent evidence that renal inflammation can be ameliorated by interfering with the gut microbiota through the administration of , prebiotics, and postbiotics. In addition to these innovative approaches, we address the recent discovery of new targets for drugs long in use in clinical practice. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, NF-ĸB inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and antimetabolic drugs can reduce renal macrophage infiltration and slow down the progression of renal disease by mechanisms independent of those usually attributed to these compounds. Allopurinol, an inhibitor of uric acid production, has been shown to decrease renal inflammation by limiting activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. So far, these protective effects have been shown in experimental studies only. Clinical studies will establish whether these novel strategies can be incorporated into the arsenal of treatments intended to prevent the progression of human disease.Copyright © 2019 Andrade-Oliveira, Foresto-Neto, Watanabe, Zatz and Câmara.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586210>Therapeutic Delivery of Ang(1-7) Via Genetically Modified Probiotic: A Dosing Study.</a></h2><p>In recent years a number of beneficial health effects have been ascribed to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that extend beyond lowering blood pressure, primarily mediated via the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2)/angiotensin (1-7) or Ang(1-7)/MAS receptor axis. Moreover, once thought as merely a systemic effector, RAS components exist within tissues. The highest tissue concentrations of ACE2 mRNA are located in the gut making it an important target for altering RAS function. Indeed, genetically engineered recombinant  are promising treatment strategies offering delivery of therapeutic proteins with precision. An Ang(1-7) secreting Lactobacillus paracasei (LP) or LP-A has been described for regulation of diabetes and hypertension; however, we are the first to our knowledge to propose this paradigm as it relates to aging. In this Research Practice manuscript, we provide proof of concept for using this technology in a well-characterized rodent model of aging: the Fisher344 x Brown Norway Rat (F344BN). Our primary findings suggest that LP-A increases circulating levels of Ang(1-7) both acutely and chronically (after 8 or 28 treatment days) when administered 3 or 7x/week over 4 weeks. Our future preclinical studies will explore the impact of this treatment on gut and other age-sensitive distal tissues such as brain and muscle.© The Author(s) 2019.

The objective of the present study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and effects of the consumption of a milk formula during the first year of life that is supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 or Bifidobacterium breve CECT7263, two strains originally isolated from breast milk.A randomized, double blind, controlled, parallel group study including healthy, formula-fed infants was conducted. Two hundred and thirty-six 1-month-old infants were selected and randomly divided into three study groups according to a randomization list. Infants in the control group received a standard powdered infant formula until 12 months of age. Infants in the probiotic groups received the same infant formula but supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 Lc40 or B. breve CECT7263. Main outcome was weigh-gain of infants as safety marker.One hundred and eighty-nine infants completed the eleven months of intervention (61 in control group, 65 in Lf group and 63 in Bb group). The growth of infants in the three groups was consistent with standards. No significant differences were observed in the main outcome, weight-gain (Control group: 5.77 Kg ± 0.95, Lf group: 5.77 Kg ± 1.31, Bb group: 5.58 Kg ± 1.10; p = 0.527). The three milk formulae were well tolerated, and no adverse effects were related to the consumption of any of the formula. Infants receiving B. breve CECT7263 had a 1.7 times lower risk of crying than the control group (OR = 0.569, CI 95% 0.568-0.571; p = 0.001). On the other hand, the incidence of diarrhoea in infants receiving the formula supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 was a 44% lower than in infants receiving the control formula (p = 0.014). The consumption of this Lactobacillus strain also reduced the duration of diarrhoea by 2.5 days versus control group (p = 0.044).The addition of L. fermentum CECT5716 Lc40 or B. breve CECT7263, two probiotic strains naturally found in breast milk, to infant formulae is safe and induces beneficial effects on the health of infants.The trial was retrospectively registered in the US Library of Medicine ( www.clinicaltrial.gov ) with the number  .

KB290 forms unique rugose colonies inside an agar medium; this characteristic is useful for detecting and enumerating KB290 in the gut or feces. However, the genetic elements associated with this morphology remain unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate the relation between the plasmid eps genes and rugose colony morphology in KB290. The plasmid-cured mutants formed smooth colonies, and the rugose colony morphology was restored after complementation with the eps genes. The eps genes were successfully cloned and expressed in other L. brevis and L. plantarum strains. In these transformant strains, the presence of the EPS, consisting of glucose and N-acetylglucosamine, correlated with rugose colonies, indicating that EPS is responsible for rugose colony formation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report identifying the genetic factors influencing rugose colonies in Lactobacillus strains. This rugose colony formation may serve as a useful selective marker for KB290 in routine laboratory and research settings and can be used to detect the spontaneous loss of plasmids in this strain.© 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650413>In Vitro Evaluation of Probiotic Potential of Selected Lactic Acid Bacteria Strains.</a></h2><p>Research of human microbiome demonstrates that in order to develop next generation of probiotic agents, it is necessary to choose bacterial strains featured by special properties, such as the ability of the cells to attach to intestinal walls, resistance to bile and acids, bacteriocin synthesis, antioxidative and antipathogenic activity, and survivability in intestines. Thirty-three strains of lactic acid bacteria of Lactobacillus and Lactococcus genera from the Lomonosov Moscow State University Collection of Microorganisms (CM MSU) have been tested for important probiotic properties which assist these bacteria to settle effectively in intestines: cell adhesion, ability to form biofilms, agglutination with lectin (concanavalin A), and antimicrobial activity. The results of experiments clearly demonstrate that all these properties can be classified as strain characteristics and differ even within the same species. Besides the cultures of Lactobacillus with good agglutination ability with concanavalin A (Lact. caucasicus CM MSU 155, Lact. brevis CM MSU 521), we also discovered strains with high adhesion properties (Lact. acidophilus CM MSU 146-89% affinity for hexadecane; Lact. paracasei CM MSU 527-85%; Lact. plantarum CM MSU 508-78%; Lact. caucasicus CM MSU 155-70%; and Lact. delbrueckii CM MSU 571-57%), biofilm formation ability with a hydrophobic carrier (Lact. plantarum CM MSU 588-OD of crystal violet extracts = 1.336; Lact. brevis CM MSU 521-OD = 1.207; and Lact. brevis CM MSU 535-OD = 1.151), and with high antimicrobial activity specially to Staphylococcus aureus.

Inulin is one of the most common prebiotics that exhibit twisted hydrocolloidal properties in dairy products. The present study was designed to develop a synbiotic yogurt by incorporation of  and inulin at 1%, 1.5%, and 2% (w/v), comparing with the probiotic and control plain yogurts. Microrheological, microstructural, microbiological, sensory properties, and volatile compounds of the yogurt samples were evaluated. Microrheological analysis showed that addition of inulin to yogurt slightly reduced the values of G' and G″, while solid-liquid balance (SLB) values confirmed more solid properties of the synbiotic yogurt (0.582~0.595) than the plain yogurt (0.503~0.518). A total of 18 volatile compounds were identified in the synbiotic yogurt, while only five and six compounds were identified in plain and probiotic yogurts, respectively. Physiochemical parameters such as pH, acidity, and protein content were in the normal range (as with the control), while fat content in the synbiotic yogurt decreased significantly. Addition of 1% inulin not only reduced syneresis but also maintained viability of  after 28 days of storage. Microstructural and microrheological studies confirmed the dense, compressed, homogeneous structure of the synbiotic yogurt. Thus, addition of inulin improved the textural and sensory properties of the synbiotic yogurt, as well as survival of  with viable count above 6.0 log CFU/g in yogurt, as generally required for .

It is transmitted zoonotically and may lead to chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised individuals. We evaluated if the major antigen of HEV, the capsid protein, can be used in combination with immunobiotic bacterium-like particles (IBLP) for oral vaccination in a mouse model. We have cloned and expressed the RGS-His-tagged HEV GT3 capsid protein (ORF2) in E. coli and purified it by NiNTA. IBLP were obtained from two immunobiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains acid- and heat-treated. ORF2 and the IBLP were orally administered to Balb/c mice. After three oral immunizations (14-day intervals), blood, intestinal fluid, Peyer´s patches, and spleen samples were drawn. IgA- and IgG-specific antibodies were determined by ELISA. Mononuclear cell populations from Peyer's patches and spleen were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the cytokine profiles were determined by ELISA to study cellular immunity. Orally administered recombinant ORF2 and IBLP from two L. rhamnosus strains (CRL1505 and IBL027) induced both antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. IBLP027 was more effective in inducing specific secretory IgA in the gut. IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-4 were produced by Peyer's plaques lymphocytes stimulated with ORF2 ex vivo suggesting a mixed Th1/Th2-type adaptive immune response in immunized mice. Oral vaccines are not invasive, do not need to be administered by specialized personal, and elicit both systemic and local immune responses at the port of entry.

We attempted to validate the hypothesis that low bacterial diversity increases the risk of mortality. MATERIAL AND METHODS All patients with septic shock seen at 2 medical center from 2016 through 2019 were included in this cohort study. Total DNA was isolated from stool, and high-throughput sequencing was performed. Clinical data were extracted from patient medical records and hospital databases. Patients were grouped by gut microbiota bacterial diversity (measured by Shannon diversity index) on presentation. We used logistic regression analysis to evaluate the risk of 28-day mortality in septic patients with low Shannon diversity index. RESULTS Of the 150 patients enrolled in this study, low bacterial diversity (Shannon index <3.0) was found in 80 patients and normal diversity (Shannon index ≥3.0) was found in 70 patients. Low diversity was associated with a higher unadjusted mortality risk, compared to those with normal diversity (odds ratio [OR] 2.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-2.83). However, this result became non-significant after adjusting the confounding factors such as age, sex, severity of disease, comorbid status, usage of , enteral nutrition, and antimicrobial drugs (OR 1.93, 95% CI 0.55-2.69).

Cell viability was assessed using MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2-tetrazolium, inner salt) assays, whereas apoptosis was monitored through RT-qPCR analysis of Bax, Bak, Noxa, and Bid mRNA expressions in addition to flow cytometry analysis of  cell-free supernatant (LCFS) treatment. Our results showed that the anti-cancer effect of LCFS on cell viability was pronouncedly enhanced in 3D-cultured HCT-116 cells, which was linked to the increased level of cleaved caspase 3. Additionally, upregulation of apoptotic marker gene mRNA transcription was dramatically increased in 3D cultured cells compared to 2D systems. In conclusion, this study suggests that LCFS enhances the activation of intrinsic apoptosis in HCT-116 cells and the potential anti-cancer effects of Lactobacilli mixtures in 3D culture systems.

The aim of this narrative review was to investigate the effect of anti-inflammatory nutrients, foods, and diets on inflammatory markers and fatigue in various patient populations. Next to observational and epidemiological studies, a total of 21 human trials have been evaluated in this work. Current available research is indicative, rather than evident, regarding the effectiveness of individuals' use of single nutrients with anti-inflammatory and fatigue-reducing effects. In contrast, clinical studies demonstrate that a balanced diet with whole grains high in fibers, polyphenol-rich vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acid-rich foods might be able to improve disease-related fatigue symptoms.

This reciprocal interaction is established through the vascular route of the portal vein that carries gut-derived products directly to the liver, and the liver feed-back route of bile and antibody secretion to the intestine. The intestinal mucosal and vascular barrier is the functional and anatomical structure that serves as a playground for the interactions between the gut and the liver, limiting the systemic dissemination of microbes and toxins while allowing nutrients to access the circulation and to reach the liver. The control of microbial communities is critical to maintain homeostasis of the gut-liver axis, and as part of the two-way communication the liver shapes intestinal microbial communities. Alcohol disrupts the gut-liver axis at multiple interconnected levels, including the gut microbiome, mucus, epithelial barrier and antimicrobial peptides production, which increases the microbial exposure and the pro-inflammatory environment of the liver. Growing evidences indicate the pathogenetic role of microbe-derived metabolites, such as trimethylamine, secondary bile acids, SCFA and ethanol, in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Cirrhosis by itself is associated to profound alterations in gut microbiota and damage at the different levels of defense of the intestinal barrier, including the epithelial, the vascular and the immune barriers. The relevance of the severe disturbance of the intestinal barrier in cirrhosis has been linked to translocation of live bacteria, bacterial infections and disease progression. The identification of the elements of the gut-liver axis primarily damaged in each chronic liver disease offers possibilities to intervention. Beyond antibiotics, upcoming therapies centered in the gut include new generations of , bacterial metabolites (postbiotics), fecal microbial transplantation, and carbon nanoparticles. FXR-agonists target both the gut and the liver and are currently being tested in different liver diseases. Finally, synthetic biotic medicines, phages that target specific bacteria or therapies that create physical barriers between the gut and the liver offer new approaches of treatment.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

However, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells 786-0 and OS-RC-2 were resistant to TRAIL. The present study examines the potential of combining polyphenolic compound resveratrol (RES) with TRAIL. We found that RES can sensitize RCC cells to TRAIL-induced death. Electron microscopy analyses showed that RES plus TRAIL can induce both autophagy and apoptosis in RCC cells. It was proved that the apoptosis is caspase-dependent and the activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 was involved in this process. Besides, we also found that XIAP expression was significantly inhibited after RES plus TRAIL treatment in RCC cells. Furthermore, a fiber-modified replication-deficient adenovirus Ad5/35-TRAIL was generated to test the synergistic effect of RES and TRAIL in vivo.

Low-dose antibiotics have historically been used to modulate food production animals and their microbiome. Identifying alternatives to antibiotics conferring similar modulatory properties has been elusive. The purpose of this study was to determine if a host-tailored probiotic could recapitulate effects of a low-dose antibiotic on host response and the developing microbiome. Over 13 days of life, turkey poults were supplemented continuously with a low-dose antibiotic or oral supplementation of a prebiotic with or without two different  (8 cage units,  = 80 per group). Gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal communities of poults were characterized by 16S rRNA gene and ITS2 amplicon sequencing. Localized and systemic host gene expression was assessed using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), kinase activity was assessed by avian-specific kinome peptide arrays, and performance parameters were assessed. We found that development of the early-life microbiome of turkey poults was tightly ordered in a tissue- and time-specific manner. Low-dose antibiotic and turkey-tailored probiotic supplementation, but not nontailored probiotic supplementation, elicited similar shifts in overall microbiome composition during development compared to controls. Treatment-induced bacterial changes were accompanied by parallel shifts in the fungal community and host gene expression and enhanced performance metrics. These results were validated in pen trials that identified further additive effects of the turkey-tailored probiotic combined with different prebiotics. Alternative approaches to low-dose antibiotic use in poultry are feasible and can be optimized utilizing the indigenous poultry microbiome. Similar approaches may also be beneficial for humans. Alternative approaches are greatly needed to reduce the need for antibiotic use in food animal production. This study utilized a pipeline for the development of a host-tailored probiotic to enhance performance in commercial turkeys and modulate their microbiota, similar to the effects of low-dose antibiotic administration. We determined that a host-tailored probiotic, developed in the context of the commercial turkey gut microbiome, was more effective at modulating these parameters than a nontailored probiotic cocktail. Furthermore, the host-tailored probiotic mimicked many of the effects of a low-dose antibiotic growth promoter. Surprisingly, the effects of the antibiotic growth promoter and host-tailored probiotic were observed across kingdoms, illustrating the coordinated interkingdom effects of these approaches. This work suggests that tailored approaches to probiotic development hold promise for modulating the avian host and its microbiota.Copyright © 2019 Ward et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623229> Prevents Sensitization to Oral Antigen and Subsequent Increases in Intestinal Tight Junction Permeability in Juvenile-Young Adult Rats.</a></h2><p>Increased intestinal permeability is thought to underlie the pathogenesis of food allergy.

Hence, P2 was selected for quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay by isothermal annealing and extension reaction at high temperature of 70°C resulting in linearity for its DNA sequences ranging from 102 to 107 target copy numbers per assay, and displaying a detection limit of 6.17 log cfu/g of cecal digesta. Using spike testing, this system was able to detect 7.88 ± 0.06 to 11.78 ± 0.06 log copy number/g of digesta, higher than cultivation assay at about 1 log cfu/g, with good correlation of 0.99.

Of the numerous host-microbiome-disease systems of study, the emergence of chytridiomycosis (caused by , hereafter ) has been implicated in ongoing declines and extinction events of amphibians worldwide. Interestingly, there has been differential survival among amphibians in resisting  infection and subsequent disease. One factor thought to contribute to this resistance is the host-associated cutaneous microbiota.

Forty rats were randomly divided into 4 groups. The sham (control and prevention) group received intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of artificial cerebrospinal fluid, the Alzheimer group received ICV injection of Aβ(1-42), and the probiotic+Alzheimer group received 500 mg  daily (15×10 colony-forming unit) by gavage for 4 weeks before and 2 weeks after injection of Aβ(1-42). The Morris water maze test was performed for evaluation of spatial learning and memory. LTP and PPF ratios were measured to evaluate longterm synaptic plasticity and pre-synaptic mechanisms, respectively. The results showed that probiotic supplementation significantly improved learning, but not memory impairment, and increased PPF ratios compared to those in the Alzheimer group. Both Aβ(1-42) injection and probiotic supplementation alone did not significantly effect plasma level of NO. Probiotic supplementation of rats in the probiotic (6 weeks)+Alzheimer group decreased serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, and very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol significantly compared to the Alzheimer group. The results of this study suggest that probiotic supplementation may positively impact learning capacity and LTP in rats with AD, most likely via the release of neurotransmitters via presynaptic mechanisms or via a protective effect on serum lipid profiles.Copyright © 2019 by The Korean Society of Food Science and Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623188>Adjuvant Strategies for Lactic Acid Bacterial Mucosal Vaccines.</a></h2><p>Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are Gram-positive, acid-tolerant bacteria that have long been used in food fermentation and are generally recognized as safe (GRAS). LAB are a part of a normal microbiome and act as , improving the gastrointestinal microbiome and health when consumed. An increasing body of research has shown the importance of the microbiome on both mucosal immune heath and immune response to pathogens and oral vaccines. Currently, there are few approved mucosal vaccines, and most are attenuated viruses or bacteria, which necessitates cold chain, carries the risk of reversion to virulence, and can have limited efficacy in individuals with poor mucosal health. On account of these limitations, new types of mucosal vaccine vectors are necessary. There has been increasing interest and success in developing recombinant LAB as next generation mucosal vaccine vectors due to their natural acid and bile resistance, stability at room temperature, endogenous activation of innate and adaptive immune responses, and the development of molecular techniques that allow for manipulation of their genomes. To enhance the immunogenicity of these LAB vaccines, numerous adjuvant strategies have been successfully employed. Here, we review these adjuvant strategies and their mechanisms of action which include: Toll-like receptor ligands, secretion of bacterial toxins, secretion of cytokines, direct delivery to antigen presenting cells, and enterocyte targeting. The ability to increase the immune response to LAB vaccines gives them the potential to be powerful mucosal vaccine vectors against mucosal pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644891>Heat-killed probiotic regulates the body's regulatory immunity to attenuate subsequent experimental autoimmune arthritis.</a></h2><p>Administration of inactivated  has been proved to enhance host immunity. Herein, we aim to explore their potential in modulating systemic autoimmune disorders. The bovine type II collagen (CII)-induced arthritis (CIA) and CII antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) mice model was used in this study. Heat-killed Lactobacillus reuteri (h-L. reuteri) was administered before or after the induction of CIA. The results indicated that the severity of CIA was alleviated and the prevalence of CIA was decreased in the mice pre-treated with h-L. reuteri. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, we found that decreased serum CII-specific IgG antibody IL-6 and CXCL1 but the increased level of IL-10 was found in h-L. reuteri-treated cohort. Moreover, h-L. reuteri treatment decreased the severity and incidence of arthritis in the CAIA model which is associated with a early decrease of IL-6. Systematic supplement of exogenous IL-6 reversed h-L. reuteri-induced CIA suppression. For regulatory immune responses, the frequency of Tregs and CD4+IL-10+ cells was increased in the draining lymph of joint of h-L. reuteri-treated mice after second immunization. Parallelly, we found that if CIA was induced, CD103+ dendritic cells in mesenteric lymph nodes and α4β7+ Tregs in the spleen were increased in h-L. reuteri-treated mice, suggesting h-L. reuteri might affect the peripheral migration of Tregs to modulating CIA. Finally, the mice with progressive CIA were treated with h-L. reuteri after the second immunization. No alleviation of CIA severity, as well as an increase of splenic α4β7+ Tregs, was observed in these mice. This study indicates that pre-administration of h-L. reuteri can alleviate the CIA in mice and may serve as a promising strategy for autoimmune disease prevention.Copyright © 2019.

The influence of the microbiome in drug response has only been investigated in detail for the last 10 years. The human microbiome is a complex and highly dynamic system, which varies dramatically between individuals, yet there exists a common core microbiome that is heritable and can be transmitted to progeny. Here, we review the role of the human microbiome, which is now widely accepted as a major factor that drives the interpersonal variation in therapeutic response. We describe examples in which the microbiome modifies drug action. Despite its complexity, the microbiome can be readily altered, with the potential to increase the benefits and reduce the toxicity and side-effects associated with pharmaceutical drugs. The potential of new microbiome-based strategies, such as Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT),  and phage therapy as promising medical therapeutics are outlined. We also suggest a combination reductionist and system-level approaches that could be applied to further investigate the role of microbiota in drug metabolism modulation of drug response. Finally, we emphasize the importance of combining microbiome and pharmacology studies, as a novel means to treat disease and reduce side effects.© 2019 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics © 2019 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581750>Supplementation with  Increases the Maximal Oxygen Consumption and Maximal Aerobic Speed Attained by Rats Subjected to an Incremental-Speed Exercise.</a></h2><p>Benefits to the host metabolism resulting from  (Sb) supplementation have been described; however, no study has investigated the effects of this supplementation on aerobic metabolism and performance during physical exercise. Thus, in the present study, we addressed the effects of Sb supplementation on the rate of oxygen consumption (VO), mechanical efficiency (external work divided by VO), and aerobic performance of rats subjected to fatiguing, incremental-speed exercise. Twenty-six male Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups: (1) non-supplemented, in which rats received 0.1 mL of a saline solution, and (2) Sb-supplemented, in which rats received 0.1 mL of a suspension containing 8.0 log colony-forming units. The rats received the treatments by gavage for 10 consecutive days; they were then subjected to fatiguing treadmill running. Sb supplementation did not change the VO values or mechanical efficiency during submaximal exercise intensities. In contrast, at fatigue, VO was increased by 12.7% in supplemented rats compared with controls ( = 0.01). Moreover, Sb improved aerobic performance, as evidenced by a 12.4% increase in maximal running speed attained by the supplemented rats ( < 0.05).

Now, almost a century later, the adverse consequences of these highly effective drugs have become evident in the form of antibiotic-resistant infections, which are on the rise around the world. The search for solutions to this problem has involved both the introduction of newer types of antibiotics and, increasingly, the development of alternative strategies to prevent infections due to multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this article, we review the pathophysiological connection between the use of antibiotics and the occurrence of such infections.

Randomized controlled trials have shown positive effects of  on clinical outcomes in these commonly occurring RTIs. Two meta-analyses published by the York Health Economics Consortium (YHEC) and Cochrane reported the efficacy of  in reducing incidence and duration of RTIs, number of antibiotic courses, and days absent from work. The aim of this study was to assess the potential health-economic impact of  on RTI-associated events and expenses in the US primary care setting. A state-transition microsimulation model reproduced a study population representative of the US national demographics for age and gender (1/1,000 sample). RTI incidence was based on the influenza-like illness outpatient consultation rate reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) FluView. Data on vaccination, on factors that negatively impact RTI outcomes, on resource utilization, and on productivity loss were obtained from US national databases. Analyses were performed for both meta-analyses independently. Outcomes included cost savings for the health care payer, related to a reduced number of RTI episodes, less outpatient consultations, and decreased medical prescriptions as well as cost savings from a broader societal perspective related to productivity loss. The analysis showed that generalized probiotic intake in the US population for 2017-2018 would have allowed cost savings for the health care payer of 4.6 million USD based on the YHEC scenario and 373 million USD for the Cochrane scenario, by averting 19 million and 54.5 million RTI sick days, respectively, compared to no . Antibiotic prescriptions decreased with 1.39-2.16 million courses, whereas absence from work decreased by 3.58-4.2 million days when applying the YHEC and Cochrane data, respectively. When productivity loss is included, total savings for society represented 784 million or 1.4 billion USD for the YHEC and Cochrane scenarios, respectively. Subgroup analyses demonstrated an incremental benefit of  in at-risk groups, which might be of relevance for targeted interventions.

While bacteria-derived products can induce aversive responses and influence pain perception, recent work suggests that "abnormal" microbiota is associated with neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here we review how the gut microbiota modulates afferent sensory neurons function and pain, highlighting the role of the microbiota/gut/brain axis in the control of behaviors and neurological diseases. We outline the changes in gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis, and their influence on painful gastrointestinal disorders. Furthermore, both direct host/microbiota interaction that implicates activation of "pain-sensing" neurons by metabolites, or indirect communication via immune activation is discussed.

Despite decades of work developing and testing prevention strategies, ICU-acquired pneumonia remains stubbornly pervasive. Pneumonia prevention studies are difficult to interpret because all are at risk of bias due to the subjectivity and poor specificity of pneumonia definitions. Interventions associated with improvements in objective outcomes in addition to pneumonia, such as length of stay or mortality, should therefore be prioritized. Avoiding intubation, minimizing sedation, implementing early extubation strategies, and mobilizing patients do appear to improve some of these objective outcomes. Many of our other assumptions about how best to prevent ICU-acquired pneumonia, however, have recently been challenged. Elevating the head of the bed is supported by very little randomized trial data. Early reports suggested that subglottic secretion drainage may decrease time to extubation and ICU length of stay, but more recent analyses refute these findings. Novel endotracheal tube cuff designs do not clearly lower pneumonia rates. A large randomized trial of selective digestive decontamination in ICUs with high baseline rates of antimicrobial resistance did not identify any benefit. Oral care with chlorhexidine may increase mortality risk and stress ulcer prophylaxis may facilitate pneumonia. Early data on  suggest a possible effect but there is no clear signal yet that they shorten duration of mechanical ventilation or lower mortality. Ventilator bundles on balance do appear to be beneficial but it is not clear which components are most important nor how best to implement them.

It affects the production quality, damages the liver, and increases mortality in broilers. The present study is focused to explore appropriate utilization of Selenium (Se) as a feed additive in broiler chickens against high temperature.Day-old male broiler chickens (Ross 308) ( = 200) were grouped according to the supplements used in their basal diets such as: corn-soybean basal diet as control (Con), a basal diet containing sodium selenite, basal diet with , and a basal diet containing selenium-enriched  (SP). At the end of the experimental period of 42 days, the liver was isolated and was used to determine the antioxidant capacity through a spectrophotometer. Inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines production in the liver was measured through a real-time polymerase chain reaction.Hepatic analyses revealed the decreased level of malondialdehyde, whereas glutathione, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and superoxide dismutase levels were increased in the SP group. Furthermore, supplementation of SP significantly up-regulated the mRNA expression of glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1), GPx4, IL6, and IL10 and down-regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.It is thus concluded that SP as a potential nutritive supplement may facilitate hepatic protection by suppressing hepatic oxidation, inflammation, and necrosis during the high ambient temperature of summer.Copyright: © Journal of Advanced Veterinary and Animal Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591781>Letter: ?

Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria models ( (Moro) Hansen and Mocquot (ATCC® 4356™) and  S17, respectively) have been successfully encapsulated for the first time in pH-independent microparticulate polymethacrylates (i.e., Eudraguard biotic) used for the targeted delivery of nutraceuticals to the colon. These bacteria have also been encapsulated within the mucoadhesive polymethacrylate Eudragit RS 100 widely used as targeted release formulation for active pharmaceutical ingredients. The enteric microparticles remained unaltered under simulated gastric conditions and released the contained viable microbial cargo under simulated intestinal conditions. Buoyancies of 90.2% and 57.3% for Eudragit and Eudraguard microparticles, respectively, and long-term stability (5 months) for the encapsulated microorganisms were found. Cytotoxicity of the microparticles formulated with both polymers was evaluated (0.5-20 mg/mL) on Caco-2 cells, showing high cytocompatibility. These results underline the suitability of the synthesized materials for the successful delivery of probiotic formulations to the target organ, highlighting for the first time the potential use of Eudraguard biotic as an effective enteric coating for the targeted delivery of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606256>The effect of  on the incidence of Clostridioides difficile: Retrospective cohort analysis.</a></h2><p>Conflicting evidence exists regarding  and the incidence of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). This study evaluates whether  are efficacious for CDI prophylaxis in patients receiving antibiotics.A retrospective cohort analysis of patients admitted to NYU Winthrop Hospital who received at least 1 dose of antibiotics considered high risk of inducing CDI. Patients were grouped according to probiotic use; association between probiotic use and incident CDI was examined. A model for incident CDI adjusting for known CDI risk factors was estimated.Of 3,267 patients, 4.6% had CDI within 12 weeks of antibiotics initiation. A total of 5.1% received  within 24 hours of initiation, and 6.6% initiated  during the 12-week follow-up. Of those taking  within 24 hours of antibiotics, 9.6% had CDI, and of those not taking  4.2% had CDI (relative risk, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.4, 3.7). In time-dependent Cox models accounting for probiotic initiation and adjusting for potential confounders, a positive association between  and CDI remained significant (hazard ratio, 2.7; P < .001).Patients who received antibiotics with concurrent  were more likely to have an incident of CDI compared with those who did not receive . Additional risk factors were histamine 2 receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, and administration of multiple antibiotics simultaneously.The present study, because of its large population and inclusion of multiple variables playing a role in CDI, serves as a valuable resource when considering efficacy of  as CDI prophylaxis.Copyright © 2019 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

The experimental diets were: fishmeal (FM) containing 10% fishmeal (without rapeseed meal), and rapeseed meal (RM) containing 50% rapeseed meal (without fishmeal), and two semi-purified diets either without (T0) or with 1.25% (T1) supplemental hydrolysable tannin. The approximate content of tannin in the RM diet was 1.31%, which was close to that of T1, while the tannin content of FM was close to that of T0. The weight gain rate of grass carp of the RM group was significantly lower than that of the FM group, while the feeding conversion ratio and the feeding rate were significantly higher in the T1 group than in T0. The muscle lipid content was significantly lower in RM than in FM, while T1 was lower than T0. Intestinal activities of trypsin and α-amylase were significantly higher in T1 and RM groups compared with the other treatments. The hepatic activities of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were lower in T1 and RM groups compared with the other treatments, while hepatic glycogen, and malonaldehyde were significantly higher in T1 and RM groups. In serum, the total protein and globulin contents were significantly higher in T1 and RM groups, while albumin was significantly lower in the RM group compared to the FM group. High-throughput sequencing showed that Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla among groups. The intestinal microbial diversity was higher in T1 and RM. Redundancy analysis showed that tannin, rapeseed meal, and intestinal trypsin activity were positively or negatively correlated with the relative abundance of several different intestinal microbiota at phylum and/or genus levels. The results indicated that 1.25% tannin could not be the main reason for the poor growth of grass carp of the RM group; however, the protein metabolism was disturbed, the absorption of carbohydrate was improved, and the accumulation of lipid had decreased. Furthermore, tannin and rapeseed meal supplementations modulated the intestinal microbiota, and may sequentially regulate the intestinal function by fermenting dietary nutrition, producing digestive enzymes, and modulating .Copyright © 2019 Yao, Chen, Ringø, Zhang, Huang and Hua.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575764>Deleterious Effects of Neonicotinoid Pesticides on Drosophila melanogaster Immune Pathways.</a></h2><p>Neonicotinoid insecticides are common agrochemicals that are used to kill pest insects and improve crop yield. However, sublethal exposure can exert unintentional toxicity to honey bees and other beneficial pollinators by dysregulating innate immunity. Generation of hydrogen peroxide (HO) by the dual oxidase (Duox) pathway is a critical component of the innate immune response, which functions to impede infection and maintain homeostatic regulation of the gut microbiota. Despite the importance of this pathway in gut immunity, the consequences of neonicotinoid exposure on Duox signaling have yet to be studied. Here, we use a  model to investigate the hypothesis that imidacloprid (a common neonicotinoid) can affect the Duox pathway. The results demonstrated that exposure to sublethal imidacloprid reduced HO production by inhibiting transcription of the  gene. Furthermore, the reduction in  expression was found to be a result of imidacloprid interacting with the midgut portion of the immune deficiency pathway. This impairment led to a loss of microbial regulation, as exemplified by a compositional shift and increased total abundance of  and  spp. (dominant microbiota members) found in the gut. In addition, we demonstrated that certain probiotic lactobacilli could ameliorate Duox pathway impairment caused by imidacloprid, but this effect was not directly dependent on the Duox pathway itself. This study is the first to demonstrate the deleterious effects that neonicotinoids can have on Duox-mediated generation of HO and highlights a novel coordination between two important innate immune pathways present in insects. Sublethal exposure to certain pesticides (e.g., neonicotinoid insecticides) is suspected to contribute to honey bee () population decline in North America. Neonicotinoids are known to interfere with immune pathways in the gut of insects, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We used a  model to understand how imidacloprid (a common neonicotinoid) interferes with two innate immune pathways-Duox and Imd. We found that imidacloprid dysregulates these pathways to reduce hydrogen peroxide production, ultimately leading to a dysbiotic shift in the gut microbiota. Intriguingly, we found that presupplementation with probiotic bacteria could mitigate the harmful effects of imidacloprid. Thus, these observations uncover a novel mechanism of pesticide-induced immunosuppression that exploits the interconnectedness of two important insect immune pathways.Copyright © 2019 Chmiel et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583780>Contrasting Strategies: Human Eukaryotic Versus Bacterial Microbiome Research.</a></h2><p>Most discussions of human microbiome research have focused on bacterial investigations and findings.

The test group received two 3-month-long administrations of L. reuteri (2 lozenges/day after brushing) with a 3-month washout period, while the control one received a placebo. Outcome measures were tooth survival, complications and adverse events, change in probing pockets depth (PPD), change in probing attachment level (PAL), presence of bleeding on probing (BOP) and patient's evaluation of treatment. Measurements were collected at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.At 1 year, no dropout, tooth loss, complications or adverse event were recorded. Mean PPD and mean PAL and percentages of sites with BOP were statistically improved (p < 0.05) compared with baseline in both groups, while more PPD reduction at all time points (p < 0.05) and more PAL gain at 6 months and more BOP reduction at 6 and 9 months were found in the probiotic group (p < 0.05).Within the limitation of the study, the use of L. reuteri  lozenges improved some clinical outcomes in treated GPIII-IVC patients during maintenance therapy.

Both probiotic provision and donor milk availability varied between 0%-100% among networks whereas feeding initiation and advancement rates were similar in most networks. The 9792 infants included in the cohort study to link survey results and cohort outcomes, revealed similar baseline characteristics but considerable differences in factors associated with NEC between networks. 397 (4.1%) neonates underwent NEC surgery, ranging from 2.4%-8.4% between networks. Standardised ratios for surgical NEC were lower for Australia/New Zealand, higher for Spain, and comparable for the remaining six networks.The variation in implementation of NEC prevention practices and in factors associated with NEC in literature could not be associated with the variation in surgical NEC incidence.

Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD).  may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative colitis patients,  remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti-inflammatory capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced murine model of colitis. The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β.

The aggregation of transgenic granulocyte neutrophils in zebrafish from a normal environment and from a sterile environment was calculated, and the anti-inflammatory activity of SEP was evaluated. To evaluate the anti-ulcerative colitis activity of SEP, DSS-induced colitis mice were given SEP, salicylazosulfapyridine (SASP), or SASP + SEP. Then, the concentrations of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α in the serum were detected, the HE-stained colon tissue was examined by microscopy the species composition and abundance distribution of the intestinal flora was analyzed. The results showed that 500 μg/mL SEP treatment significantly alleviated neutrophil granulocyte aggregation in the zebrafish inflammation model; Diarrhea, hematochezia and body weight loss were alleviated to a certain extent in mice gavaged with SEP and SASP, and the combination of SASP with SEP was the most effective in mice. The damage to villi in the intestine was completely repaired, and the levels of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α, which are associated with inflammation, were all reduced.

Thus, the current study investigates the effect of constipation symptoms on gut functionality following the modulation of gut microbiota and metabolites via dietary fiber intervention.Constipation causes a significantly reduced short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production and a higher level of iso-butyrate. The feces of constipated people are characterized with inhibited Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcaceae and Roseburia abundance. Desulfovibrionaceae is identified to be an important endotoxin producer in constipated patients, and a butyrate-enriched SCFAs profile achieved by dietary fiber supplement accelerates gastrointestinal transit and increases the thickness of the mucosal layer, possibly through triggering the secretion of colonic hormones and enhancing the expression of tight junction proteins for maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. More importantly, an interacting regulatory mechanism among SCFAs, in particular butyrate and propionate, may be involved in signaling between the microbiome and host cells in the colon.Gut microbiota, characterized with enriched butyrate-producing and depressed Desulfovibrionaceae bacteria, attenuates constipation symptoms through promoting intestinal hormones secretion and maintaining gut barrier integrity.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Here we employed a mouse model of concurrent exposure of CA and PM5S-induced liver injury and determined the effects of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in the prevention of the bile acid disorders and liver injury. Mice challenged with CA + PM5S had significantly increased levels of serum and hepatic bile acids and bilirubin and liver enzyme. Pretreatment with LGG significantly reduced bile acid and bilirubin levels associated with reduced liver enzyme level and mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We also showed that the beneficial effects of LGG is likely mediated by hepatic FXR activation and bile salt export pump (BSEP) upregulation. In conclusion, our results provide a rationale for the application of  in the management of ICP through gut microbiota-mediated FXR activation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Bismuth-containing quadruple therapy has recently been the first-line regimen recommended in many European countries but has limited efficacy in ASEAN especially Thailand. This study was aim to evaluate efficacy of high dose PPI Bismuth-containing quadruple therapy with  supplement for H. pylori eradication.In this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study, H. pylori infected patients were randomized to receive 7-or 14-day high dose PPI- bismuth-containing quadruple therapy with or without  supplement. Probiotic was 37.5 mg Lactobacillus reuteri (Biogaia®) in tablet twice daily. CYP2C19 genotyping and antibiotic susceptibility tests were also done. H. pylori eradication was defined as a negative 13C-urea breath test at least 4 weeks after treatment.100 subjects were enrolled (72 females, 28 males, mean age=54 years). Antibiotic resistance was 15.6% for clarithromycin, 34.1% for metronidazole. CYP2C19 genotyping was performed in both group and revealed 13%, 50% and 37% for poor, intermediate and rapid metabolizers, respectively. Overall eradication rates of 7-day and 14-day regimens with probiotic were 68% and 96%; P value=0.027. The eradication rate for all patients with poor and rapid metabolizers were 100% with 14-day regimen. 14-day regimen with  can provide 100% eradication with clarithromycin resistance, metronidazole resistance or dual clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance group. Furthermore, the incidence of nausea and vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and bitter taste were significantly lower in patients with  group compared with placebo (6%vs.26%, P=0.002,OR=0.126,95% CI=0.03-0.53; 4%vs.18.0%, P=0.017, OR= 0.155,95% CI=0.03-0.81 and 4%vs.26%, P= 0.001,OR= 0.08, 95%CI= 0.016-0.41, respectively).The 14-day high dose PPI- bismuth-containing quadruple therapy with probiotic can provide an excellent cure rate for H. pylori infection as first line treatment irrespective of CYP2C19 and antibiotic resistance pattern. Adding probiotic also significantly reduced treatment-related adverse events and improve the patients’ compliance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627123>Prebiotics and  as potential therapy for cognitive impairment.</a></h2><p>Cognitive functions, such as learning and memory, may be impaired during aging. Age-related cognitive impairment is associated with selective neuronal loss, oxidative changes that lead to microglia activation and neuroinflammation. In addition, it is associated to alteration reduction in trophic factors affecting neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. In recent years, attention has been paid to the relationship between gut microbiota and brain. In aging, there is an alteration in microbiota, gut microbiota diversity is perturbed with an increase in pathogenic bacteria at the expense of beneficial ones. Dysbiosis may lead to chronic inflammation, and a decrease in bacteria metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids which have been related to an upregulation of neurotrophic factors. Supplementation with prebiotics and  can modulate gut microbiota, returning it to a more physiological state; thus, they may be considered as a possible treatment for age-related cognitive impairment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Nowadays, the presence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens in foods is becoming an increasingly public health concern worldwide due to the overuse of antimicrobial drugs in animal feed. MDR pathogens can enter the food chain by posing a significant risk to both animals and consumers. MDR pathogens causing infections are untreatable due to their resistance to various antibiotics, primarily cephalosporin and carbapenems and to their extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing capability. In addition, foods of animal origin and food-related environments can be likely vehicles for spreading of multi-drug resistance genes, which accelerates the thriving of global antibiotic resistance. This paper reviews the role of foods of animal origin as a vehicle for MDR pathogens, stressing the contribution of food processes, environments, and storage conditions in dissemination and reduction of antimicrobial resistances (AMRs). Controlling the growth of MDR microorganisms and limiting the transmission/expression of AMR genes in food ecosystems could be an effective mitigation strategy, putting the focus on food processes as a part of the solution for AMR in foods. Bioprotective cultures are also a promising and environmentally friendly technology to reduce the incidence of MDR pathogens, though caution is taken as microbial starters and  can also carry AMR. Finally, applying Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and predictive microbiology, within a Risk Assessment framework, is key to get insight into those mechanisms and conditions along the food chain favoring or reducing AMR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621235>[Effects of different grasses cultivation on apple orchard soil microbial community].</a></h2><p>Taking naturally growing grass (NG) as comparison, high-throughput sequencing technique was adopted to examine the effects of Lolium perenne (LP), Trifolium repens (TR), Vulpia myuros (VM), and Vicia villosa (VV) cultivation on soil microbial community in apple orchard of Yanggu County, Shandong Province, and the correlations of soil microbial community with soil nutrient and physicochemical property. The results showed that LP increased the relative abundance of Alternaria and Aspergillus in soil, TR increased that of Gibberella, VM increased Aureobasidium and Chaetomium, and VV increased  such as Nitrososophaera and Metarhizium. However, the quantity of pathogenic bacteria Ralstonia was improved in NG treatment. Results from Spearman correlation analysis showed that the abundance of Bacillus was significantly positively correlated with the concentration of soil organic matter. The abundance of Aspergillus was significantly negatively correlated with available phosphorus, available potassium, CEC, and organic matter. The abundance of Metarhizium was significantly positively correlated with soil pH and CEC.

Recent evidence has shown a significant connection between gut microbiota and brain function, as butyrate production by microorganisms is believed to activate the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). To investigate whether modification of intestinal microbiota could impact cognitive decline in the aging brain, Romo-Araiza . conducted a study to test how probiotic and prebiotic supplementation impacted spatial and associative memory in middle-aged rats. Their results showed that rats supplemented with the symbiotic (both probiotic and prebiotic) treatment performed significantly better than other groups in the spatial memory test, though not in that of associative memory. Their data also reported that this improvement correlated with increased levels of BDNF, decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and better electrophysiological outcomes in the hippocampi of the symbiotic group. Thus, the results indicated that the progression of cognitive impairment is indeed affected by changes in microbiota induced by  and prebiotics. Potential future applications of these findings center around combatting neurodegeneration and inflammation associated not only with aging but also with the damaging posttraumatic effects of ischemic stroke.Copyright: © 2019 Brain Circulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563280>Effect of  on depressive symptoms: A meta-analysis of human studies.</a></h2><p>Accumulating data show that  may be beneficial in reducing depressive symptoms.

This study thus aims to evaluate the ability to survive under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and impact of Torulaspora delbrueckii B14 and Kluyveromyces lactis B10 as single and mixed inocula for cheese production. These two yeast strains were subjected to simulated gastrointestinal tracts and tested for self-aggregation, hydrophobicity, pathogen inhibition, antibiotic resistance, and β-galactosidase production. The yeast strains were also assessed for their ability to survive in different NaCl concentrations (2.5%, 5%, and 10% w/v), multiple temperatures (4 °C and 40 °C), and used as single and mixed starter cultures for cheese production. Yeasts population levels were monitored by YPD plating and MALDI-TOF and metabolites were analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS over the course of the 21 days cheese maturation process. T. delbrueckii B14 and K. lactis B10 both showed >80% viability after the passage through the simulated gastrointestinal tract, had self-aggregation rates >90%, and displayed β-galactosidase activities of 0.35 U/g and 0.53 U/g, respectively. Both yeasts survived at 2.5%, 5%, and 10% NaCl for 21 days and showed growth at 4 °C. In cheese, the single inoculum of K. lactis B10 and mixed inoculum showed the highest levels of lactose consumption. HS-SPME GC-MS analysis of cheese samples allowed the identification of 38 volatile compounds. The highest concentrations of most of these compounds were observed after 21 days of maturation for the cheese produced with mixed inoculum. The most abundant acids detected were hexanoic and decanoic acid; the most abundant alcohols were 2,3-butanediol, 2-phenylethanol and isoamyl alcohol, and the most prevalent ester compounds were isoamyl acetate and phenethyl acetate. Our results therefore show that T. delbrueckii B14 and K. lactis B10 are interesting yeasts for further studies in the context of  and positively impact the composition of desirable volatile compounds in cheeses, particularly when used as mixed inoculum.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We used two large datasets published by the American Gut Project (AGP) and a gut metagenomic dataset (NBT) to analyze the relationship between these two genera and the community structure of the gut microbiota. The meta-analysis showed that Bifidobacterium, but not Lactobacillus, is among the dominant genera in the human gut microbiota. The relative abundance of Bifidobacterium was elevated when Lactobacillus was present. Moreover, these two genera showed a positive correlation with some butyrate producers among the dominant genera, and both were associated with alpha diversity, beta diversity, and the robustness of the gut microbiota. Additionally, samples harboring Bifidobacterium present but no Lactobacillus showed higher alpha diversity and were more robust than those only carrying Lactobacillus. Further comparisons with other genera validated the important role of Bifidobacterium in the gut microbiota robustness. Multivariate analysis of 11,744 samples from the AGP dataset suggested Bifidobacterium to be associated with demographic features, lifestyle, and disease.

We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut dysbiosis." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension.

There are no large-scale international studies on drug use in neonatal units. Objective We aimed to describe drug use in European neonatal units and characterize its associations with geographic region and gestational age. Setting A one-day point prevalence study was performed as part of the European Study of Neonatal Exposure to Excipients from January to June 2012. Method All neonatal prescriptions and demographic data were registered in a web-based database. The impact of gestational age and region on prescription rate were analysed with logistic regression. Main outcome measure The number and variety of drugs prescribed to hospitalized neonates in different gestational age groups and geographic regions. Results In total, 21 European countries with 89 neonatal units participated. Altogether 2173 prescriptions given to 726 neonates were registered. The 10 drugs with the highest prescription rate were multivitamins, vitamin D, caffeine, gentamicin, amino acids for parenteral nutrition, phytomenadione, ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, fat emulsion for parenteral nutrition and . The six most commonly prescribed ATC groups (alimentary tract and metabolism, blood and blood-forming organs, systemic anti-infectives, nervous, respiratory and cardiovascular system) covered 98% of prescriptions. Gestational age significantly affected the use of all commonly used drug groups. Geographic region influenced the use of alimentary tract and metabolism, blood and blood-forming organs, systemic anti-infectives, nervous and respiratory system drugs. Conclusion While gestational age-dependent differences in neonatal drug use were expected, regional variations (except for systemic anti-infectives) indicate a need for cooperation in developing harmonized evidence-based guidelines and suggest priorities for collaborative work.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645830>: A Friend or Foe in ICU (A Case Report with Solution).</a></h2><p> or , also known as baker's yeast or brewer's yeast, is normally a nonpathogenic microbe.

The effect of in-feed  on L. intracellularis infection dynamics was evaluated. In brief, 70 2.5-week-old-pigs were randomly divided into six groups with 10-20 pigs each. All pigs were fed an age appropriate base ration for the duration of the study, which was supplemented with one of three Bacillus strains including B. amyloliquefaciens (T01), B. licheniformis (T02) and B. pumilus (T03). Another group was orally vaccinated with a commercial live L. intracellularis vaccine (VAC) at 3 weeks of age. At 7 weeks of age, T01-LAW, T02-LAW, T03-LAW, VAC-LAW and the POS-CONTROL groups were challenged with L. intracellularis while the NEG-CONTROL pigs were not challenged. All pigs were necropsied 16 days later. By the time of inoculation, all VAC-LAW pigs had seroconverted and at necropsy 10-65% of the pigs in all other challenged groups were also seropositive. The results indicate a successful L. intracellularis challenge with highest bacterial DNA levels in POS-CONTROL pigs, VAC-LAW pigs and T01-LAW pigs. There was a delay in onset of shedding in T02-LAW and T03-LAW groups, which was reflected in less severe macroscopic and microscopic lesions, reduced intralesional L. intracellularis antigen levels and a lower area under the curve for bacterial shedding. Under the study conditions, two of the  tested suppressed L. intracellularis infection. The obtained findings show the potential of  in achieving antibiotic-free control of L. intracellularis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635441> S1 Improves Colitis induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid by the Inhibition of NF-κB Signaling in Mice.</a></h2><p> S1 strongly inhibits the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in lipopolysaccharide-induced peritoneal macrophages for the mechanism that lactic acid bacteria from kimchi inhibit tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was isolated. The protective effect of this strain on the colitis mouse model induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) was further evaluated. TNBS significantly elevated myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression, macroscopic scores, and colon shortening. Oral  S1 administration resulted in reduction of TNBS-induced loss in body weight, colon shortening, MPO activity, expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB).  S1 inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, induced by TNBS, but enhanced IL-10 expression.  S1 showed resistance to artificial digestive juices and adherence to intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells. Thus,  S1 may inhibit the NF-κB pathway and be used as functional food to treat colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640545>Symbiotic bacteria motivate the foraging decision and promote fecundity and survival of Bactrocera dorsalis (Diptera: Tephritidae).</a></h2><p>The gut bacteria of tephritid fruit flies play prominent roles in nutrition, reproduction, maintenance and ecological adaptations of the host. Here, we adopted an approach based on direct observation of symbiotic or axenic flies feeding on dishes seeded with drops of full diet (containing all amino acids) or full diet supplemented with bacteria at similar concentrations to explore the effects of intestinal bacteria on foraging decision and fitness of Bactrocera dorsalis.The results show that intestinal  elicit beneficial foraging decision and enhance the female reproduction fitness and survival of B. dorsalis (symbiotic and axenic), yet preferences for probiotic diets were significantly higher in axenic flies to which they responded faster compared to full diet. Moreover, females fed diet supplemented with Pantoea dispersa and Enterobacter cloacae laid more eggs but had shorter lifespan while female fed Enterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella oxytoca enriched diets lived longer but had lower fecundity compared to the positive control. Conversely, flies fed sugar diet (negative control) were not able to produce eggs, but lived longer than those from the positive control.These results suggest that intestinal bacteria can drive the foraging decision in a way which promotes the reproduction and survival of B. dorsalis.

However, there have not been but a few studies on the clinical benefits of oral probiotic therapy.  Dental records of 60 patients that were enrolled in an Institutional Review Board approved study were reviewed as to current caries activity status with measurement of the Decayed Missing Filled Teeth index and by Caries Management By Risk Assessment (CAMBRA) determination. The current oral health status was compared to the prior-to-study enrollment status and then analyzed in respect to published national norms. The data (without any identifiers) had a statistical analysis by a blinded biostatistician. The data was subjected to statistical analysis (Statsgraphic) before and after the probiotic therapy.  Of the 53 subjects available for follow up, only 4 had remained caries active with a grand total of 27 carious lesions being detected and subsequently restored in this group. Of the original total of 60 patients with 292 initial carious lesions, after probiotic therapy and dental restoration, 78 total restorations were placed in the subject group over the following three years. Approximately half of these restorations were required in teeth that had initially presented with smaller lesions and had been placed in a "watch" category. Two of the patients that developed further carious lesions had been randomly assigned to the probiotic PerioBalance, while the other two caries active patients were assigned EvoraKids probiotic. Of the original group of caries active patients, 24 did not present with any further carious involvement. Another 25 could be categorized as caries static, as the restorations required were substantially less than before probiotic therapy had been begun. The F-ratio, which in this case equals 51.3313, is a ratio of the between-group estimate to the within-group estimate. Since the P-value of the F-test is less than 0.05, there is a statistically significant difference between the means of the 4 variables at the 95.0% confidence level.  The tested probiotic supplements had a statistically significant effect on the caries experience of the enrolled subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31558007>Recent Advances in Anti-Aging Medicine.</a></h2><p>A rapidly aging population in Korea has led to increased attention in the field of anti-aging medicine. The purpose of anti-aging medicine is to slow, stop, or reverse the aging process and its associated effects, such as disability and frailty. Anti-aging medicine is emerging as a growing industry, but many supplements or protocols are available that do not have scientific evidence to support their claims. In this review, the mechanisms of action and the clinical implications of anti-aging interventions were examined and explained. Calorie restriction mimetics define compounds that imitate the outcome of calorie restriction, including an activator of AMP protein kinase (metformin), inhibitor of growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis (pegvisomant), inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (rapamycin), and activator of the sirtuin pathway (resveratrol). Hormonal replacement has also been widely used in the elderly population to improve their quality of life. Manipulating healthy gut microbiota through prebiotic/ or fecal microbiota transplantation has significant potential in anti-aging medicine. Vitamin D is expected to be a primary anti-aging medicine in the near future due to its numerous positive effects in the elderly population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612820>Plant- and nutraceutical-based approach for the management of diabetes and its neurological complications: a narrative review.</a></h2><p>Diabetes is an important metabolic disease affecting many organs and systems in the body. Nervous system is one of the body systems affected by diabetes and neuropathic complications are troublesome in diabetic patients with many consequences. As diabetes has deleterious influences almost on bodily systems, integrative approach seems to be necessary accepting body as whole and integrating body systems with lifestyle and living environment. Like some traditional health systems such as Ayurveda, integrative approach includesadditional modalities to overcome both diabetes and diabetic complications. In general, these modalitiesconsist of nutraceuticals and plant products. Prebiotics and  are two types of nutraceuticals having active ingredients, such as antioxidants, nutrient factors, microorganisms, etc. Many plants are indicated for the cure of diabetes. All of these may be employed in the prevention and in the non-pharmacological management of mild-to-moderate diabetes. Severe diabetes should require appropriate drug selection. Being complementary, prebiotics, , plants and exercise may be additive for the drug therapy of diabetes. Similarly, there are complementary approaches to prevent and cure neurological and/or behavioral manifestations of diabetes, which may be included in therapy and prevention plans. A scheme is given for the prevention and therapy of comorbid depression, which is one of the most common behavioral complications of diabetes. Within this scheme, main criteria for the selection of modalities is the severity of diseases, so that personalized managementmay be developed for diabetic patients using prebiotics and  in their diets, plants and drugs avoiding possible interactions.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656736>Characterization and probiotic properties of  from human breast milk.</a></h2><p>Several studies have reported a complex microbial community in human breast milk.

Patients with CKD also develop other comorbidities, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemias, liver and cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal problems, and cognitive deterioration, which worsens their health. Therapy includes reducing comorbidities or using replacement therapy, such as peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, and organ transplant. Health care systems are searching for alternative treatments for CKD patients to mitigate or retard their progression. One new topic is the study of uremic toxins (UT), which are excessively produced during CKD as products of food metabolism or as a result of the loss of renal function that have a negative impact on the kidneys and other organs. High urea concentrations significantly modify the microbiota in the gut also, cause a decrease in bacterial strains that produce anti-inflammatory and fuel molecules and an increase in bacterial strains that can metabolize urea, but also produce UT, including indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate. UT activates several cellular processes that induce oxidative environments, inflammation, proliferation, fibrosis development, and apoptosis; these processes mainly occur in the gut, heart, and kidney. The study of the microbiota during CKD allowed for the implementation of therapy schemes to try to reduce the circulating concentrations of UT and reduce the damage. The objective of this review is to show an overview to know the main UT produced in end-stage renal disease patients, and how prebiotics and  intervention acts as a helpful tool in CKD treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608448>Postnatal  and allergic disease in very preterm infants: sub-study to the ProPrems randomized trial.</a></h2><p>Probiotic supplementation to mothers and/or their term-born infants has been suggested to prevent allergic disease, in particular eczema; however, no studies have investigated  for prevention of allergic diseases in very preterm infants. We evaluated the effect of a postnatal probiotic combination on development of allergic diseases in very preterm infants.This sub-study was an a priori secondary outcome of the ProPrems multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial (ANZCTR:12607000144415). ProPrems randomized 1099 very preterm infants to receive a probiotic combination or placebo from soon after birth until discharge from hospital or term corrected age (CA), whichever was earlier. Allergic disease (eczema, atopic eczema, food allergy, wheeze, atopic sensitization) was assessed in a subgroup of ProPrems infants (n=281) as close to 12 months CA as possible by questionnaire, clinical examination and skin prick tests to common allergens.There was no difference in eczema incidence between the probiotic and placebo group (35[30%] of 118 infants vs 37[27%] of 137 infants, respectively, absolute difference 2.65%, 95% CI -8.45 to 13.75).

To explore the biological function of the porcine STC-1 gene, the effects of changes in stanniocalcin expression on cellular metabolism and mitochondrial function were studied. A vector overexpressing the STC-1 gene and an siRNA silencer of the STC-1 gene were transfected into porcine kidney epithelial PK15 cells. After the STC-1 gene expression level was induced to change, STC-1 protein- and mitochondrial function-related proteins such as PMP70, OPA, DRP, Mfn and STC-1-related acetylated protein were detected by Western blotting. Cell apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ATP were detected using flow cytometry methods. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the changes in mitochondrial structure and morphology. The results showed that overexpression of the STC-1 gene could significantly upregulate the levels of PMP70, OPA, DRP and Mfn. STC-1 gene expression, which could decrease the apoptosis rate and reactive oxygen species production to significantly increase the cell membrane potential and reduce the formation of intracellular ATP, which also affected the morphology and number of mitochondria. The results were reversed when the STC-1 gene expression was silenced. The results suggested that the porcine STC-1 gene is closely related to cell growth metabolism and mitochondrial function, which influence the mitochondrial function-related proteins. The present study is useful for further understanding STC-1 gene function and provides a theoretical basis for improving the production characteristics of domestic pigs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this context, fish health and antiviral response were also investigated. A 12-week feeding trial was conducted in a flow-through rearing system involving 6 weeks in freshwater and 6 weeks in seawater. Fish received a control and probiotic diet. The composition of the salmon gut bacterial communities was determined by high-throughput sequencing of digesta and mucosa samples from both the freshwater and seawater stage. The main phyla detected during both freshwater and seawater stages were , , , and . Significant differences were observed between the intestinal microbiota in the digesta and the mucosa. Both probiotic supplementation and the seawater transfer (SWT) had a substantial impact on the microbial communities, with most pronounced changes detected in the mucosal communities after SWT. This last finding together with a significantly higher antiviral response ( and  gene expression) in the distal intestine of fish fed the probiotic diet suggest a causal link between the microbiota modulation and activation of antiviral response. Feeding  during the freshwater stage did not significantly increase survival after infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) challenge after SWT, although higher survival was observed in one out of two replicate challenge tanks. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that both dietary probiotic supplementation and transfer from freshwater to seawater have an important role in modulating the bacterial communities in the distal intestine of Atlantic salmon. Furthermore, supplementation of the diet with  MA18/5M can modulate antiviral response.Copyright © 2019 Jaramillo-Torres, Rawling, Rodiles, Mikalsen, Johansen, Tinsley, Forberg, Aasum, Castex and Merrifield.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571251>Probiotic LGG prevents liver fibrosis through inhibiting hepatic bile acid synthesis and enhancing bile acid excretion in mice.</a></h2><p>Cholestatic liver disease is characterized by gut dysbiosis and excessive toxic hepatic bile acids (BAs). Modification of gut microbiota and repression of BA synthesis are potential strategies for the treatment of cholestatic liver disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects and to understand the mechanisms of the probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), on hepatic bile acid synthesis, liver injury and fibrosis in bile-duct ligation (BDL) and Mdr2 mice. Global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors were used to dissect the role of FXR. LGG treatment significantly attenuated liver inflammation, injury and fibrosis with a significant reduction of hepatic BAs in BDL mice. Hepatic concentration of T-βMCA, an FXR antagonist, was markedly increased in BDL mice and reduced in LGG-treated mice, while chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), an FXR agonist, was decreased in BDL mice and normalized in LGG-treated mice. LGG treatment significantly increased the expression of serum and ileum FGF15 and subsequently reduced hepatic CYP7A1 and BA synthesis in BDL and Mdr2 mice. At the molecular level, these changes were reversed by global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors in BDL mice. In addition, LGG treatment altered gut microbiota, which was associated with increased BA de-conjugation and increased fecal and urine BA excretion both in BDL and Mdr2 mice. In vitro studies showed that LGG suppressed the inhibitory effect of T-βMCA on FXR and FGF19 expression in Caco-2 cells. Conclusion: LGG supplementation decreases hepatic BA by increasing intestinal FXR/FGF15 signaling pathway-mediated suppression of BA de novo synthesis and enhances BA excretion, which prevents excessive BA-induced liver injury and fibrosis in mice.© 2019 The Authors.

Several members of the  genus are purported to exert various health-promoting effects at local and systemic levels, e.g., limiting pathogen colonization/invasion, influencing gut homeostasis, and influencing the immune system through changes in innate and/or adaptive immune responses. This has promoted extensive research efforts to shed light on the precise mechanisms by which bifidobacteria are able to stimulate and interact with the host immune system. These studies uncovered a variety of secreted or surface-associated molecules that act as essential mediators for the establishment of a bifidobacteria-host immune system dialogue, and that allow interactions with mucosa-associated immune cells. Additionally, the by-products generated from bifidobacterial carbohydrate metabolism act as vectors that directly and indirectly trigger the host immune response, the latter by stimulating growth of other commensal microorganisms such as propionate- or butyrate-producing bacteria. This review is aimed to provide a comprehensive overview on the wide variety of strategies employed by bifidobacteria to engage with the host immune system.Copyright © 2019 Alessandri, Ossiprandi, MacSharry, van Sinderen and Ventura.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648369>Review article: fungal alterations in inflammatory bowel diseases.</a></h2><p>Emerging data suggest that alterations in gut fungi may be associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In healthy individuals, gut commensal fungi act synergistically with other members of the microbiota to maintain homeostasis but their role in IBD is less clear.To review the role of gut fungi and their trans-kingdom interactions with bacteria in IBD METHODS: A literature search was conducted on Ovid and Pubmed to select relevant animal and human studies that have reported fungi and IBD.There is an increased total fungal load particularly of Candida and Malassezia species in the faeces and mucosa of Crohn's disease patients, and a lower fungal diversity in the faeces of ulcerative colitis patients. Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein (CARD)-9 polymorphism in Crohn's disease patients favours Malassezia colonisation that worsens gut inflammation. Diet high in carbohydrates increased the total abundance of Candida species, whereas protein-rich diet had the opposite effect. Anti-fungal therapies are mostly used to treat Candida albicans or Histoplasma capsulatum infections in IBD, whereas pilot studies of supplementing fungal  Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, Saccharomyces boulardii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 strain showed therapeutic effects in IBD.Gut fungi are altered in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

In this study, we propose a promising strategy for cancer treatment using modulation of oxidative stress by suppression of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), a typical antioxidant enzyme. siRNA which can be applied to the development of nucleic acid drugs, enabling them to eliminate unwanted side effects, increase specificity, and avoid the problem of drug resistance, was employed for GSTP-silencing at the transcriptional level. The silencing of the pi class of GST (GSTP) that displayed the most characteristic expression profile in 13 kinds of cancer cell lines has shown significant impairment in the growth of cancer cells due to oxidative stress caused by excess ROS accumulation. Comparative proteomics between normal cells and GSTP-silenced pancreatic cancer cell PANC-1 suggested that GSTP-silencing facilitated the mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings show promise for the development of strategies toward cancer therapy based on the mechanism that allows genetic silencing of GSTP to promote oxidative stress through mitochondria dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619913>: A Potential Immunotherapeutic Approach for the Treatment of Schizophrenia.</a></h2><p> are in use for physiological boosting, health supplement, and for treatment since historical time.

Most diarrheal pathogens have developed resistance against the major classes of antibiotics commonly used for assuaging diarrheal symptoms. Antimicrobial resistance develops when pathogens acquire antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) through genetic recombination from commensals and pathogens. These are the constituents of the complex microbiota in all ecological niches. The recombination events may occur in the environment or in the gut. Containment of AMR can be achieved through a complete understanding of the complex and diverse structure and function of the microbiota. Its taxonomic entities serve as focal points for the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genetic determinants. Molecular methods complemented with culture-based diagnostics have been historically implemented to document these natural events. However, the advent of next-generation sequencing has revolutionized the field of molecular epidemiology. It has revolutionized the method of addressing relevant problems like diagnosis and surveillance of infectious diseases and the issue of antimicrobial resistance. Metagenomics is one such next-generation technique that has proved to be a monumental advancement in the area of molecular taxonomy. Current understanding of structure, function and dysbiosis of microbiota associated with antimicrobial resistance was realized due to its conception. This review describes the major milestones achieved due to the advent and implementation of this new technique in the context of antimicrobial resistance. These achievements span a wide panorama from the discovery of novel microorganisms to invention of translational value.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662387>Effects of a probiotic treatment () and open-label placebo on symptoms of allergic rhinitis: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Several studies suggest that gut microbiota may play an important role in allergic diseases.

Effects of this probiotic on the immune system have been reported by several studies, but the majority of the previous trials were animal studies. In addition, it is well known that symptoms in allergic rhinitis are prone to exhibit high placebo responses. Moreover, recent studies report that even placebos without deception (open-label placebos) are highly effective in reducing symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Our study design combines both new approaches to assess effects on allergic symptoms in patients. The objective of this study is to compare the effects of a probiotic treatment () with effects seen by open-label placebo, concealed placebo treatment and no treatment control.A total of 120 patients with allergic rhinitis will be randomly assigned to one of four different groups: a double-blind probiotic/placebo group (groups 1 and 2), an open-label placebo group (group 3) and a no-treatment group (group 4) to control for spontaneous variation of symptoms.

The balanced composition of the intestinal microflora can be easily disturbed and any changes caused by diet, stress, obesity, diseases of the digestive system or medication may lead to pro-inflammatory immune responses and initiation of disease processes, including cancer. Maintaining intestinal microflora homeostasis is therefore extremely important for human health. In order to restore it, it is most often used to take specimens with appropriate bacterial cultures, i. e. . Due to the fact that yoghurts are a source of probiotic bacteria, their regular consumption may be a strong point in the prevention of various types of diseases, including civilization diseases and cancer. This article reviews the literature in the area of using yogurt bacteria in the prevention of cancer. Issues addressed in the article relate to the characteristics of yogurt bacteria, beneficial effects of  on human health, anti-cancer properties of yogurt bacteria and their metabolites, i. e. immunoregulation, prevention of bacterial infections, maintenance of cellular connections in the intestine and anti-cancer activity of bacterial metabolites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592594>Impact of Phytobacterial Agent on the Toxic Damage to the Liver and Ileum of White Rats.</a></h2><p>Numerous pharmaceutical agents can induce adverse reactions in the human body, including toxicity to the liver and the inflammation of intestines. Therefore, nowadays one of the most urgent problems in modern medical science is the prevention and restoration of morphological and dysbiosis disorders caused by numerous medications. With this background in mind, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of phytobacteria on toxic damage to the structure and function of the liver and ileum, as well as the composition of the large intestine microflora in white rats with intestinal dysbacteriosis due to carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and ampicillin trihydrate. In order to prevent toxic damage to the liver and ileum of experimental animals, a phytobacterial agent was used. This test agent was composed of a mixture of commercial lactobacteria Lactobacillus helveticus with a water-soluble extract of thyme (Thymus Serpyllum L.) on a sterile milk basis. Our results showed that the introduction of phytobacterial agent led to reduced inflammation, accelerated regeneration of the ileum mucous membrane, and a positive effect on the damaged intestine. The phytobacterial agent increased the resistance of the body to potentially pathogenic microorganisms and toxic compounds by restoring the microflora of the large intestine. It was established that the phytobacterial remedy resulted in the normalization of the intestinal microflora of white rats, which had toxic damage to the liver and ileum caused by CCl4 and ampicillin trihydrate administration. Moreover, the usage of phytobacteria was correlated with improvement in the structure and function of the liver and ileum.Copyright © 2019, Archives of Razi Institute.

Traditionally, probiotic food research has heavily focused on the genera  and , along with their benefits for gut health. Recently with the identification of new probiotic strains specifically intended for oral health applications, the development of probiotic foods for oral health benefits has garnered interest, with a renewed focus on identifying new food formats for delivering . The development of novel oral probiotic foods is highly complex, as the composition of a food matrix dictates: (1) bacterial viability during production and shelf life and (2) how bacteria partition with components within a food matrix and subsequently adhere to oral cavity surfaces. At present, virtually no information is available on oral probiotic strains such as ; specifically, how orally-derived strains survive under different food parameters. Furthermore, limited information exists on the partition behavior of  with food components, governed by physico-chemical interactions and adhesion phenomena. This review aspires to examine this framework by providing a foundation with existing literature related to the common probiotic genera, in order to inform and drive future attempts of designing new oral probiotic food formats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560460>The influence of the newly isolated Lactobacillus plantarum LUHS135 and Lactobacillus paracasei LUHS244 strains on blood and faeces parametersin endurance horses.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the newly isolated Lactobacillus plantarum LUHS135 and Lactobacillus paracasei LUHS244 strains grown in potato juice (with a cell count of 8.0-9.0 log10 CFU/ml) on the blood and faeces parameters of exercising horses. The horses were classified into four different groups: a control group (which received no ); the first group (which received 200 ml of L. plantarum culture in potato juice); the second group (which received 200 ml of L. paracasei culture in potato juice); and the third group (which received an L. plantarum and L. paracasei mix (with the mix consisting of 100 ml of each). Indices for the blood and faeces microflora were obtained before and after treatment of horses (on days zero and thirty). It was observed that the count for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the faeces was significantly higher on day thirty, whereas it was lower when it came to the total enterobacteria count (TCE). Despite the ambiguous influence of any treatment on blood parameters, the L. plantarum × L. paracasei mixture increased the concentration of HGB and O2 saturation in blood samples which were taken from the horses. L. paracasei significantly decreased the lactate concentration levels in horse blood samples.

Research on novel  related therapies has evoked much attention. In our previous study, both Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and LGG cell-free supernatant (LGGs) were found to protect against alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis; however, the effects of LGG and LGGs on cardiac tissues of obese mice exposed to IH have not been determined. Here we exposed high-fat high-fructose diet (HFHFD)-induced obese mice to IH, to establish a model of obesity with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Mice were divided into four groups: (1) HFHFD for 15 weeks; (2) HFHFD for 15 weeks with IH in the last 12 weeks (HFHFD/IH); (3) and (4) HFHFD/IH plus oral administration of either LGG (10 CFU bacteria/day) or LGGs (dose equivalent to 10 CFU bacteria/day) over the 15 weeks, respectively. Compared to HFHFD mice, HFHFD/IH-mice showed heart dysfunction with significant cardiac remodeling and inflammation; all these pathological and functional alterations were prevented by treatment with both LGG and LGGs (no significant difference between LGG and LGGs in this respect). The cardioprotective effect of LGG and LGGs against IH/HFHFD was associated with up-regulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant pathways. Our findings suggest a cardioprotective effect of LGG and LGGs in obese mice with OSA.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637019>Demystifying the manipulation of host immunity, metabolism, and extraintestinal tumors by the gut microbiome.</a></h2><p>The trillions of microorganisms in the gut microbiome have attracted much attention recently owing to their sophisticated and widespread impacts on numerous aspects of host pathophysiology. Remarkable progress in large-scale sequencing and mass spectrometry has increased our understanding of the influence of the microbiome and/or its metabolites on the onset and progression of extraintestinal cancers and the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.

Dogs were clinically healthy, with normal physical examination findings, blood, urine, and fecal analyses and ultrasonographic examinations.In this blinded, controlled study E. faecium SF68 was administered to the probiotic group for 14 days. Blood samples were taken from all dogs at days 0, 14, and 28. Serum ALT and ALP activity and total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were determined on these 3 days.The probiotic induced no significant changes in mean ALT and ALP activity. Mean cholesterol concentration did not change during probiotic administration but a significant decrease was seen on day 28 (P < .01). Mean triglyceride concentration increased progressively, becoming significant at day 28 (P < .05), with 1 dog developing hypertriglyceridemia.E. faecium SF68 would not create confusion when monitoring dogs with hepatobiliary disease because ALT and ALP activity did not change significantly. A significant decrease in cholesterol and significant increase in triglyceride concentrations were seen at day 28 but were not clinically relevant, with 1 dog showing hypertriglyceridemia. A longer trial is warranted to assess if the probiotic effects could be clinically relevant and to assess its potential use in hypertriglyceridemic dogs.© 2019 The Authors.

This study aims to investigate the protective effects and molecular mechanisms of  such as Clostridium tyrobutyricum (C. tyrobutyricum) on Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)-induced endometritis. The results showed that S. aureus infection significantly induced the pathological damage of the uterus, increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β, and attenuated the expression of tight junction proteins of uterine tissues. However, C. tyrobutyricum pretreatment obviously reduced the inflammatory response and reversed the changes of tight junction proteins of the uterus induced by S. aureus. Together, the data showed that C. tyrobutyricum also inhibited the expression of the TLR2/NF-κB signaling pathway and HDAC induced by S. aureus. In addition, the treatment of mice with live C. tyrobutyricum, spent culture supernatants (SCS) from C. tyrobutyricum, rather than inactive C. tyrobutyricum, inhibited the inflammatory response induced by S. aureus. Through further research, we found that the levels of butyrate in both blood and uterine tissues of mice treated with C. tyrobutyricum were significantly increased. These findings underscore the protective effect of C. tyrobutyricum on endometritis by enhancing the uterus barrier integrity and inhibiting the inflammatory response. The anti-inflammatory mechanism may occur through the regulation of the expression of TLR2/NF-κB and HDAC, and C. tyrobutyricum can be a potentially therapeutic candidate for the treatment of endometritis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660551>Study of gastrointestinal tract viability and motility via modulation of serotonin in a zebrafish model by .</a></h2><p>The relationship between bacterial strains and serotonin regulation was studied via the in vitro screening of the strains. Using the transparent visibility of zebrafish, the strains for intestinal peristalsis were quickly screened. The methods and results were as follows: (1) 18 strains with outstanding gastrointestinal viability via their surface hydrophobicity, self-aggregation ability, acid tolerance, bile tolerance, simulated gastric digestion and intestinal fluid tolerance were determined from 54 unpublished strains. (2) 5dpf zebrafish were randomly selected and divided into 22 groups with 12 tails in each group. The intestinal peristalsis frequency of each group within 1 min was calculated after immersing the model zebrafish in a 108 CFU mL-1 strain solution, with 5 effective strains obtained. (3) The serotonin in zebrafish was measured by Elisa and fluorescence immunization. The regulation mechanism of serotonin by Bifidobacterium animalis F1-7 was revealed by RT-PCR and the results show that this most effective strain promotes intestinal peristalsis in zebrafish via the modulation of serotonin release and key genes for serotonin synthesis in zebrafish.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560502>[Sepsis due to Lactobacillus reuteri in an extreme preterm newborn: case report].</a></h2><p>The use of  in the neonatal population has contributed to a decrease in morbidity and mortality in this population through the reduction in the incidence of entities such as necrotizing enterocolitis, infections associated with health care and neonatal sepsis.

Lactococcus lactis and Schizochytrium limacinum are commonly used as immunostimulants due to their health benefits for the aquatic organisms. In the present study, we assessed the effects of dietary supplementation with L. lactis HNL12 combined with S. limacinum algal meal on the growth performances, innate immune response, and disease resistance of C. altivelis against Vibrio harveyi. The results showed that fish fed with a combination diet of L. lactis and S. limacinum exhibited significantly higher final weight, percent weight gain, and specific growth rate compared with groups fed with them alone. A bacterial challenge experiment indicated that the group fed with the L. lactis combined with S. limacinum diet achieved the highest relative percent of survival value (68.63%), suggesting that L. lactis and S. limacinum significantly improved the disease resistance against V. harveyi after a 4-week feeding trial. Moreover, the respiratory burst activity of macrophages of fish fed with a L. lactis combined with S. limacinum diet was significantly higher than that of fish fed the control diet after 1, 2, and 3 weeks of feeding. The serum superoxide dismutase of fish fed with a L. lactis combined with S. limacinum diet significantly increased compared to those fed the control diet after 1 and 2 weeks of feeding, while the serum alkaline phosphatase of fish fed with a L. lactis combined with S. limacinum diet after 2 and 4 weeks was significantly increased, compared to the control group. The serum lysozyme activities of fish fed with a L. lactis combined with S. limacinum diet significantly increased compared to the control group after 2 weeks of feeding. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing of the C. altivelis head kidney was conducted to explore the immune-regulating effects of the L. lactis combined with S. limacinum diet on C. altivelis. A total of 86,919 unigenes, annotated by at least one of the reference databases (Nr, Swiss-Prot, GO, COG, and KEGG), were assembly yielded by de novo transcriptome. In addition, 157 putative differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the L. lactis combined with S. limacinum group and the control group. For pathway enrichment, the DEGs were categorized into nine KEGG pathways, which were mainly related to infective diseases, antigen processing and presentation, digestive system, and other immune system responses. The findings of this study suggest that the L. lactis combined with S. limacinum diet can induce positive effects on the growth, immunity, and disease resistance of C. altivelis against V. harveyi.

In recent years, many changes in the bacterial composition of the intestinal microflora have been reported in colorectal cancer, suggesting the involvement of the intestinal microflora in the development and progression of colorectal cancer. Along with these reports, research on lactic acid bacteria that have a beneficial effect on the human body for the purpose of improving the intestinal environment and treating intestinal diseases has advanced.

In in vitro experiments, the extract derived from  06CC2 significantly suppressed the proliferation of Caco2 colorectal cancer cells in comparison to control and non-cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that endoplasmic reticulum stress and the JNK/p38 MAPK signaling system are involved in the induction of apoptosis.

There are no basic criteria regarding differentiation of early-onset sepsis (EOS) versus late-onset sepsis (LOS). Stratification used in studies on neonatal sepsis also rarely includes the general condition of the newborn according to unambiguous assessment at birth, which hampers the establishment of a clear, uniform epidemiological description of neonatal sepsis. We aim to review the published data about the epidemiology and microbiology of sepsis in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Data was also collected on sepsis prevention programs that can be implemented in neonatal units. The outcomes of interest were incidence or incidence density of EOS and LOS, microbiology of EOS and LOS, and data on the methodology of the research, in particular the criteria for inclusion and exclusion of newborns from the study. Pubmed, EMBASE, LILACS Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar were used. For the preselection step, inclusion criteria included: "bloodstream infection" or "neonatal sepsis" (MesH), "very low birth weight", and "country" full-text studies, human, and English language. Exclusion criteria included: studies published in languages other than English and studies available only as an abstracts. For proper selection, inclusion criteria included: information about epidemiology or microbiology bloodstream infection (BSI), study population and case definitions, exclusion criteria, narrative reviews, commentaries, case studies, pilot studies, study protocols, pediatric studies, and only clinical data (without microbiology or epidemiology) or studies with only one etiological factor analysis. The data review indicated the lack of an unequivocal, unified definition and no unambiguous basic criteria with regard to differentiation of EOS versus LOS. Among infants <1500 g, studies reported an EOS rate from 7% to 2%. For studies using other definitions (mostly all inborn babies), the rate of EOS ranged from 1% to 3%. The LOS incidences were much more varied among countries; the highest rates were in the multicenter studies focused on very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. The main pathogens in EOS are GBS and Gram-negative bacteria in LOS. Our review data shows that LOS microbiology is very diverse and that Gram-positive cocci, especially staphylococci, predominate versus Gram-negative rods. Unfortunately, the lack of uniform, international prevention programs results in high newborn morbidity and insufficient postnatal prevention of late-onset infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647500>Association of Dietary Fiber and Yogurt Consumption With Lung Cancer Risk: A Pooled Analysis.</a></h2><p>Dietary fiber (the main source of prebiotics) and yogurt (a probiotic food) confer various health benefits via modulating the gut microbiota and metabolic pathways. However, their associations with lung cancer risk have not been well investigated.To evaluate the individual and joint associations of dietary fiber and yogurt consumption with lung cancer risk and to assess the potential effect modification of the associations by lifestyle and other dietary factors.This pooled analysis included 10 prospective cohorts involving 1 445 850 adults from studies that were conducted in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Data analyses were performed between November 2017 and February 2019. Using harmonized individual participant data, hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for lung cancer risk associated with dietary fiber and yogurt intakes were estimated for each cohort by Cox regression and pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Participants who had a history of cancer at enrollment or developed any cancer, died, or were lost to follow-up within 2 years after enrollment were excluded.Dietary fiber intake and yogurt consumption measured by validated instruments.Incident lung cancer, subclassified by histologic type (eg, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma).The analytic sample included 627 988 men, with a mean (SD) age of 57.9 (9.0) years, and 817 862 women, with a mean (SD) age of 54.8 (9.7) years. During a median follow-up of 8.6 years, 18 822 incident lung cancer cases were documented. Both fiber and yogurt intakes were inversely associated with lung cancer risk after adjustment for status and pack-years of smoking and other lung cancer risk factors: hazard ratio, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.91) for the highest vs lowest quintile of fiber intake; and hazard ratio, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.87) for high vs no yogurt consumption. The fiber or yogurt associations with lung cancer were significant in never smokers and were consistently observed across sex, race/ethnicity, and tumor histologic type. When considered jointly, high yogurt consumption with the highest quintile of fiber intake showed more than 30% reduced risk of lung cancer than nonyogurt consumption with the lowest quintile of fiber intake (hazard ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.61-0.73] in total study populations; hazard ratio 0.69 [95% CI, 0.54-0.89] in never smokers), suggesting potential synergism.Dietary fiber and yogurt consumption was associated with reduced risk of lung cancer after adjusting for known risk factors and among never smokers.

This review covers the current concepts of the etiology of Crohn´s disease and ulcerative colitis by focusing on an unbalanced interaction between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosal barrier. Understanding these issues is of paramount importance for the development of targeted therapies aiming at the disease cause. : Gut microbiota alterations and a dysfunctional intestinal mucosa are associated with IBD. Here we focus on specific defense structures of the mucosal barrier, namely antimicrobial peptides and the mucus layer, which keep the gut microbiota at a distance under healthy conditions and are defective in IBD. : The microbiology of both forms of IBD is different but characterized by a reduced bacterial diversity and richness. Abundance of certain bacterial species is altered, and the compositional changes are related to disease activity. In IBD the mucus layer above the epithelium is contaminated by bacteria and the immune reaction is dominated by the antibacterial response. Human genetics suggest that many of the basic deficiencies in the mucosal response, due to Paneth cell, defensin and mucus defects, are primary.

The experiment was conducted on three hundred sixty, one-day-old female Ross 308 chicks, which were randomly selected from 20,000 birds and divided into three treatment groups (n = 120) with ten replicates per treatment. The control group (C) was fed a commercial diet, the probiotic group (PRO) was fed the same diet with an added 1% of the probiotic Lavipan® (Lactococcus lactis, Carnobacterium divergens, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and the synbiotic group (SYN) was fed the commercial diet with an added synbiotic: 0.8% of the prebiotic RFO (extracted from lupin seeds) and 1% Lavipan®. According to the manufacturer's data, apart from the typical probiotic action,microorganisms contained in the preparation release anti-bacterial substances (hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins) and, therefore, are antagonistic towards pathogenic bacteria present in the gut of animals. Supplementation took place in the first seven days of rearing, and all birds had ad libitum access to water and feed during the 42 days of the experiment. On the last day, all birds were slaughtered and samples from three segments of the small intestine were taken. Villi area, height, width and crypt depth ratios were read using Multiscan software. Synbiotic supplementation increased the BWG of broilers from first to tenth day of rearing, compared to the control group. The PRO group had improved villi morphometric parameters of the duodenum. In the jejunum and ileum, both bioactive substances improved villus width and villus surface area. Crypts were deeper in the small intestine of birds supplemented with bioactive substances, which allows greater renewal of the villi. As expected, the intestinal morphometric parameters of broiler chickens benefited from bioactive substance supplementation.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598135>Effects of  on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become prevalent in recent decades, especially in developed countries, and approaches for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD are not clear.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving , prebiotics, or synbiotics for middle-aged or older adults were employed for meta-analysis by using RevMan 5.3, and heterogeneity and risk of bias assessment were performed.A total of eight studies, involving 564 participants, were included. , prebiotics, or synbiotics supplementation was able to significantly elevate serum calcium levels (0.52 mg/dl, 95% CI [0.38, 0.66]), heterogeneity: p = .13, I  = 44%), while the results of meta-analysis failed to support the effects of this supplementation on the parameters related to bone health in middle-aged and older adults, including BMD, parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase., prebiotics, or synbiotics supplementation exerts a facilitating influence on the level of serum calcium, while the present study has not yet supported the beneficial effects of such interventions on bone health. Therefore, further studies with high-quality RCTs are required to determine the effects of , prebiotics, or synbiotics supplementation on middle-aged and older adults.© 2019 Sigma Theta Tau International.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631492>Re: Lactobacilli-containing vaginal  to cure or prevent bacterial or fungal vaginal dysbiosis: a systematic review and recommendations for future trial designs.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600934>Hypnotic Effects of  PS150 on Pentobarbital-Induced Sleep in Mice.</a></h2><p>The bidirectional communication between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system appears to be functionally linked to the intestinal microbiome, namely the microbiome-gut-brain axis (MGBA).  with health benefits on psychiatric or neurological illnesses are generally called psychobiotics, and some of them may also be able to improve sleep by targeting the MGBA. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a psychobiotic strain,  PS150 (PS150), on sleep improvement by using a pentobarbital-induced sleep mouse model. Compared with the vehicle control group, the oral administration of PS150, but not the other  strains, significantly decreased the sleep latency and increased the sleep duration of mice, suggesting strain-specific sleep-improving effects of PS150. Moreover, the ingestion of diphenhydramine, an antihistamine used to treat insomnia, as a drug control group, only increased the sleep duration of mice. We also found that the sleep-improving effects of PS150 are time- and dose-dependent. Furthermore, the oral administration of PS150 could attenuate a caffeine-induced sleep disturbance in mice, and PS150 appeared to increase the expression of the gene encoding the adenosine 1 receptor in the hypothalamus of mice, as assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Taken together, our results present a potential application of PS150 as a dietary supplement for sleep improvement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640120>Comprehensive Understanding of the Bacterial Populations and Metabolites Profile of Fermented Feed by 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.</a></h2><p>The comprehensive bacterial populations and metabolites profile in fermented feed is unclear, which may have significant effects on the stability of fermented feed quality and animal gut health. In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to explore the bacterial populations and metabolites profile in the fermented feed incubated with  (MF) or without  (SF). The  were a combination of ,  and . The pH and lactic acid levels were higher in MF than in SF ( 0.05), while the total volatile fatty acid content was lower ( 0.05). Interestingly, after fermentation, the most abundant bacterial genus in MF was , rather than the added   or .  and a few potential pathogens ( and ) were dominant in SF ( 0.05). Metabolomics analysis identified 32 different metabolites in the two types of fermented feed. These metabolites enriched in MF, such as maleic acid, phenylacetic acid, ethyl linoleate, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, and L-theanine had potential antimicrobial activities. Conclusively, the addition of  enriched a few potentially beneficial microbes and small molecular compounds with antimicrobial activities, and inhibited the potential pathogens in fermented feed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615096>Potential Mechanisms of  Action in the Prevention and Treatment of Colorectal Cancer.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer is one of the most common and most diagnosed cancers in the world. There are many predisposing factors, for example, genetic predisposition, smoking, or a diet rich in red, processed meat and poor in vegetables and fruits.  may be helpful in the prevention of cancer and may provide support during treatment. The main aim of this study is to characterize the potential mechanisms of action of , in particular the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. ' potential mechanisms of action are, for example, modification of intestinal microbiota, improvement of colonic physicochemical conditions, production of anticancerogenic and antioxidant metabolites against carcinogenesis, a decrease in intestinal inflammation, and the production of harmful enzymes. The prevention of colorectal cancer is associated with favorable quantitative and qualitative changes in the intestinal microbiota, as well as changes in metabolic activity and in the physicochemical conditions of the intestine. In addition, it is worth noting that the effect depends on the bacterial strain, as well as on the dose administered.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632359>Probiotic  Attenuates Oxidative Stress- Induced Intestinal Injury via p38-Mediated Autophagy.</a></h2><p> have been widely used in maintaining intestinal health and one of their benefits is to enhance host antioxidant capacity. However, the involved molecular mechanisms require further investigated. Autophagy is a self-protection process in response to diverse stresses. We hypothesized that  could modulate intestinal autophagy to alleviate oxidative stress. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were orally administered  SC06 or SC08 daily for 24 days and thereafter received an intraperitoneal injection of diquat (DQ) to induce oxidative stress. We found that rats administered  SC06 showed more significant intestinal tissue repair and antioxidant properties than those administered SC08, which suggests a strain-specific effect of . Moreover, SC06 alleviated apoptosis by regulating the expression of Bcl2, Bax and cleaved caspase-3. Further investigations revealed that SC06 triggered autophagy, indicated by the upregulation of LC3 and Beclin1 and the degradation of p62 in rat jejunum and IEC-6 cells. Preincubation with autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) significantly aggravated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptotic cell formation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), not AKT (alpha serine/threonine kinase)/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), was involved in SC06-induced autophagy. Taken together,  SC06 can alleviate oxidative stress-induced disorders and apoptosis via p38-mediated autophagy. The above findings highlight a novel mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of  as functional food and provide a new perspective on the prevention and treatment of oxidative damages.Copyright © 2019 Wu, Wang, Xu, Tang, Li, Gong, Wang and Li.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602305>Effects of dietary mixture of protease and  on growth performance, blood constituents, and carcass characteristics of growing-finishing pigs.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary mixture of protease and  on growth performance, blood constituents, and carcass characteristics of growing-finishing pigs.

In the context of ageing, which is characterized by several physiological alterations leading to a low grade inflammatory status called inflammageing, evidences suggest a potential prolongevity role of . Unraveling the mechanisms underlying anti-ageing effects requires the use of simple model systems. To this respect, the nematode  represents a suitable model organism for the study of both host-microbe interactions and for ageing studies, because of conserved signaling pathways and host defense mechanisms involved in the regulation of its lifespan. Therefore, this review analyses the impact of  on  age-related parameters, with particular emphasis on oxidative stress, immunity, inflammation and protection from pathogen infections. The picture emerging from our analysis highlights that several probiotic strains are able to exert anti-ageing effects in nematodes by acting on common molecular pathways, such as insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IIS) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). In this perspective,  appears to be advantageous for shedding light on key mechanisms involved in host prolongevity in response to  supplementation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664902>Analysis of the fecal microbiota of fast- and slow-growing rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).</a></h2><p>Diverse microbial communities colonizing the intestine of fish contribute to their growth, digestion, nutrition, and immune function. We hypothesized that fecal samples representing the gut microbiota of rainbow trout could be associated with differential growth rates observed in fish breeding programs. If true, harnessing the functionality of this microbiota can improve the profitability of aquaculture. The first objective of this study was to test this hypothesis if gut microbiota is associated with fish growth rate (body weight). Four full-sibling families were stocked in the same tank and fed an identical diet. Two fast-growing and two slow-growing fish were selected from each family for 16S rRNA microbiota profiling. Microbiota diversity varies with different DNA extraction methods. The second objective of this study was to compare the effects of five commonly used DNA extraction methods on the microbiota profiling and to determine the most appropriate extraction method for this study. These methods were Promega-Maxwell, Phenol-chloroform, MO-BIO, Qiagen-Blood/Tissue, and Qiagen-Stool. Methods were compared according to DNA integrity, cost, feasibility and inter-sample variation based on non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (nMDS) clusters.Differences in DNA extraction methods resulted in significant variation in the identification of bacteria that compose the gut microbiota. Promega-Maxwell had the lowest inter-sample variation and was therefore used for the subsequent analyses. Beta diversity of the bacterial communities showed significant variation between breeding families but not between the fast- and slow-growing fish. However, an indicator analysis determined that cellulose, amylose degrading and amino acid fermenting bacteria (Clostridium, Leptotrichia, and Peptostreptococcus) are indicator taxa of the fast-growing fish. In contrary, pathogenic bacteria (Corynebacterium and Paeniclostridium) were identified as indicator taxa for the slow-growing fish.DNA extraction methodology should be carefully considered for accurate profiling of the gut microbiota. Although the microbiota was not significantly different between the fast- and slow-growing fish groups, some bacterial taxa with functional implications were indicative of fish growth rate. Further studies are warranted to explore how bacteria are transmitted and potential usage of the indicator bacteria of fast-growing fish for development of  that may improve fish health and growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611620>Isolation, characterization and identification of antigenotoxic and anticancerous indigenous  and their prophylactic potential in experimental colon carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer, the third most commonly diagnosed cancer, is a lifestyle disease where diet and gut microbiome contribute intricately in its initiation and progression. Prophylactic bio-interventions mainly  offer an alternate approach towards reducing or delaying its progression. Therefore, the present study was designed wherein a robust protocol for the isolation, characterization, and identification of indigenous  having antigenotoxic and anticancerous activity was followed along with their prophylactic potential assessment in early experimental colorectal carcinogenesis. Among forty-six isolated lactic acid bacterial strains, only three were selected on the basis of antigenotoxicity against N,N-Dimethyl dihydrazine dihydrochloride and 4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide and probiotic attributes. All three selected probiotic strains exhibited anticancerous potential as is evident by the reduced Aberrant Crypt Foci, reduced fecal pH, enhanced fecal lactic acid bacteria and altered fecal enzymes (β-glucuronidase, nitroreductase, β-glucosidase) that modulated gut microbiota and microenvironment resulting into restored histoarchitecture of the colon. The results are a clear indicator of the prophylactic potential of selected indigenous  which may be used as an alternative prophylactic biological therapy against colon carcinogenesis particularly in highly susceptible individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602728>A polyphasic approach to characterize Weissella cibaria and Weissella confusa strains.</a></h2><p>To study Weissella cibaria and Weissella confusa strains, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) members naturally present in food products, but not yet included in Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) list of European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).We carried out a comparative genome analysis of 23 sequenced W. cibaria and 7 W. confusa genomes, in parallel with a physiological and functional characterization of several strains previously isolated from sourdough-like maize bran fermentation. The genome analysis revealed the absence of dedicated pathogenicity factors. Some putative virulence genes found in Weissella genomes were also present in other LAB strains, considered safe by EFSA and commonly used as . The physiological tests carried out on our strains corroborated the genomic results. Moreover, the following functional traits of interest to application in the food sector were identified: the majority of tested strains displayed high acidification rate, high reducing ability, production of exopolysaccharides (EPS), arabinoxylan degradation ability, growth in the presence of fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), bile and gastric juice tolerance, and antifungal activity.These results provide evidence for the possible use of selected strains of W. cibaria and W. confusa in the food sector.This polyphasic study adds to the body of knowledge on the functional and applicable characteristics of these controversial species of LAB.

This is a clinical case report of a 52-year-old female patient with 30 years history of left-sided chronic ulcerative colitis controlled with standard of care (mesalamine and azathioprine) which subsequently relapsed and developed into active refractory ulcerative colitis. The patient became unresponsive to her medications including different forms of mesalamines and did not respond favorably to any of the other current therapies. Numerous attempts to stabilize her condition with immunosuppressants, steroids, , antibiotics, mesalamines, and various biologic agents failed to improve her clinical symptoms, and the patient was being considered for colectomy. As the last resort, modified therapy was prescribed with ustekinumab, a non-selective, anti-IL12/23 p40 monoclonal antibody. This medication has not been yet approved for use in ulcerative colitis patients. In this clinical case we report the efficacy of ustekinumab to rapidly induce and maintain remission of the severe chronic ulcerative colitis in the patient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of utilizing ustakinamub therapy for rapid induction in an active refractory ulcerative colitis patient resulting in complete remission for over one year.</p></html>
