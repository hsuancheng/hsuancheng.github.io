As a chronic metabolic disease, it is important to find new potential therapeutic targets and locate a sensitive time window for intervention. In this study, we focus on the early stage of a high-fat diet mouse model: a short-term 3-week treatment. Our results showed that this short-term 3-week HFD can already induce significant body weight gain, increased adipocyte size and surprisingly, anxiety-like behavior of the animals. Then we tried the early intervention with metformin, already reported for its effects in long-term HFD induced . For a short-term 3-week co-treatment, metformin alleviated the HFD-induced increase in body weight, the increase in adipocyte size and furthermore, the anxiety-like behavior. Differences were noted among the normal diet (ND), HFD, and HFD with metformin co-treatment groups in gut microbiota, including its composition and diversity. The possible involvement of gut microbiota cannot be ruled out. Intense phospho-AMPK staining was found in the metformin treatment group in the habenular nuclei, hippocampus and basal ganglia of the brain compared with the HFD group, implying that the anxiolytic effect of metformin could be due to the direct activation of the AMPK pathway in the anxiety-related brain nuclei.Copyright © 2019 Ji, Wang and Li.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678062>Gastric bypass versus sleeve gastrectomy in patients with type 2 diabetes (Oseberg): a single-centre, triple-blind, randomised controlled trial.</a></h1><p>For patients with  and type 2 diabetes, weight loss improves insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, and can induce remission of diabetes. The comparative efficacy of various bariatric procedures for the remission of type 2 diabetes has not been fully elucidated. We aimed to compare the effects of the two most common bariatric procedures, gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, on remission of diabetes and β-cell function.We conducted a single-centre, triple-blind, randomised trial at Vestfold Hospital Trust (Tønsberg, Norway), in which patients (aged ≥18 years) with type 2 diabetes and  were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy (the Oseberg study). Randomisation was performed with a computerised random number generator and a block size of 10. Treatment allocation was masked from participants, study personnel, and outcome assessors and was concealed with sealed opaque envelopes. Surgeons used identical skin incisions during both surgeries and were not involved in patient follow-up. The primary clinical outcome was the proportion of participants with complete remission of type 2 diabetes (HbA of ≤6·0% [42 mmol/mol] without the use of glucose-lowering medication) at 1 year after surgery. The primary physiological outcome was disposition index (a measure of β-cell function) at 1 year after surgery, as assessed by an intravenous glucose tolerance test. Primary outcomes were analysed in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. This trial is ongoing and closed to recruitment, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, .Between Oct 15, 2012, and Sept 1, 2017, 1305 patients who were preparing for bariatric surgery were screened, of whom 319 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes were assessed for eligibility. 109 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to gastric bypass (n=54) or sleeve gastrectomy (n=55). 107 (98%) of 109 patients completed 1-year follow-up, with one patient in each group withdrawing after surgery (per-protocol population). In the intention-to-treat population, diabetes remission rates were higher in the gastric bypass group than in the sleeve gastrectomy group (risk difference 27% [95% CI 10 to 44]; relative risk [RR] 1·57 [1·14 to 2·16], p=0·0054); results were similar in the per-protocol population (risk difference 27% [95% CI 10 to 45]; RR 1·57 [1·14 to 2·15], p=0·0036). In the intention-to-treat population, disposition index increased in both groups (between-group difference 55 [-111 to 220], p=0·52); results were similar in the per-protocol population (between-group difference 21 [-214 to 256], p=0.86). In the gastric bypass group, ten of 54 participants had early complications and 17 of 53 had late side-effects. In the sleeve gastrectomy group, eight of 55 participants had early complications and 22 of 54 had late side-effects. No deaths occurred in either group.Gastric bypass was found to be superior to sleeve gastrectomy for remission of type 2 diabetes at 1 year after surgery, and the two procedures had a similar beneficial effect on β-cell function. The use of gastric bypass as the preferred bariatric procedure for patients with  and type 2 diabetes could improve diabetes care and reduce related societal costs.Morbid  Centre, Vestfold Hospital Trust.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

There was a difference in PA (mesor) between groups of women who lost weight compared to those who gained weight ( = 0.007). There was a relationship between IS and PA parametres mesor: p0.001; and the most active 10 h of a day (M10):  < 0.001 - the more stable were women in their rhythm, the more PA they have. Besides confirming a relationship between PA and WL, we also found a relation between WL and CP based on acrophase. Although no direct relationship was found for the indicators of rhythm stability (IS), they can be considered very important variables because of their close connection to PA - a main factor that contributes to the success of the WL programme.According to the results of the study, screening of the CP and its stability may be beneficial in the creation of an individualized WL plan.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675433>Simultaneous angiotensin receptor blockade and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor activation ameliorate albuminuria in obese insulin-resistant rats.</a></h1><p>Insulin resistance increases renal oxidant production by up-regulating NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) expression contributing to oxidative damage and ultimately albuminuria. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and activation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor signaling may reverse this effect. However, whether angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1) blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation improve oxidative damage and albuminuria through different mechanisms is not known. Using insulin resistant Otsuka Long Evan Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, we tested the hypothesis that simultaneous blockade of AT1 and activation of GLP-1r additively decrease oxidative damage and urinary albumin excretion (U V) in the following groups: (1) untreated, lean LETO (n=7), (2) untreated, obese OLETF (n=9), (3) OLETF + angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB; 10 mg olmesartan /kg/d; n=9), (4) OLETF + GLP-1 mimetic (EXE; 10 ug exenatide/kg/d; n=7), and (5) OLETF + ARB + exenatide (Combo; n=6). Mean kidney Nox4 protein expression and nitrotyrosine (NT) levels were 30% and 46% greater, respectively, in OLETF compared to LETO. Conversely, Nox4 protein expression and NT were reduced to LETO levels in ARB and EXE, and Combo reduced Nox4, NT, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal levels by 21%, 27%, and 27%, respectively. At baseline, U V was nearly double in OLETF compared to LETO, and increased to nearly 10-fold greater levels by the end of the study. While ARB (45%) and EXE (55%) individually reduced U V, the combination completely ameliorated the albuminuria. Collectively, these data suggest that AT1 blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation reduce renal oxidative damage similarly during insulin resistance, while targeting both signaling pathways provides added benefit in restoring and/or further ameliorating albuminuria in a model of diet-induced .© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675427>Effect of Metabolic Traits on the Risk of Cirrhosis and Hepatocellular Cancer in Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the most common liver condition. Predicting its progression could help clinicians manage and potentially prevent complications. We evaluated the independent and joint effects of metabolic traits on the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with NAFLD. We assembled a retrospective cohort of patients with NAFLD diagnosed at 130 facilities in the Veterans Administration between 1/1/2004 and 12/31/2008 with follow-up through 12/31/2015. We performed competing risk, adjusted cause-specific Cox models to evaluate the effects of metabolic traits (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, ) as additive or combined indicators on time to develop cirrhosis or HCC or a composite endpoint of both. Of the 271,906 patients, 22,794 developed cirrhosis, and 253 developed HCC during a mean of 9 years follow up. At baseline, the mean BMI was 31.6 (SD, 5.6), 28.7% had diabetes, 70.3% hypertension, and 62.3% had dyslipidemia with substantial overlap among the these traits. The risk of progression was the lowest in patients with only one or no metabolic trait. There was a stepwise increase in risk with each additional metabolic trait. Compared to patients with no metabolic trait, patients with both hypertension and dyslipidemia had 1.8-fold higher risk of progression to cirrhosis/HCC (hazard ratio (HR) =1.8, 95% CI=1.59-2.06); the risk was 2.6-fold higher in patients with diabetes, , dyslipidemia and hypertension (HR=2.6, 95% CI=2.3,2.9). These associations were stronger for HCC. Diabetes had the strongest association with HCC in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Each additional metabolic trait increased the risk of cirrhosis and HCC in patients with NAFLD. Diabetes conferred the highest risk of progression to HCC. Diabetic patients with co-existing hypertension and  may be important targets for secondary prevention.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672599>Heptamethoxyflavone inhibits adipogenesis via enhancing PKA signaling.</a></h1><p>3,5,6,7,8,3',4'-heptamethoxyflavone (HMF), a naturally occurring polymethoxyflavone found in citrus peel, is known to have neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. However, the effects of HMF on adipogenesis remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that HMF inhibits the early stage of adipogenesis and maturation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. HMF treatment during preadipocyte differentiation for 8 days reduced lipid accumulation in a dose-dependent manner, and the expression levels of key adipogenic transcription factors (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα)) and the lipogenic transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP1), were lower after the initial 4 days of the differentiation. Moreover, PPARγ expression level was lower even after the initial 2 days, but C/EBPα and SREBP1 expression was not. HMF upregulated the phosphorylation of protein kinase A catalytic subunit α (PKACα), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in 3T3-L1 cells. The phosphorylation of ACC leads to the inhibition of adipogenesis. Furthermore, the induction of phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC by HMF was abolished by RNA interference targeting PKACα. Taken together, our results suggest that HMF might inhibit the early stage of adipogenesis via the activation of PKA signaling in 3T3-L1 cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study evaluated the prevalence and prognostic significance of sarcopenia and its association with survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who underwent radiotherapy (RT) to the primary site.  Between January 2009 and November 2016, 156 patients with HCC that underwent RT to the liver were retrospectively studied. Sarcopenia was defined as an L3 skeletal muscle index of <49 cm/m for men and <41 cm/m for women as proposed by Korean-specific cut-off value. Sarcopenia was identified pre- and post-RT (within 3 months from the end of RT).  Pre-RT sarcopenia occurred in 99 (63.5%) patients and was significantly associated with higher levels of protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II), lower percentage of overweight/ (body-mass index), higher percentage of previous systemic chemotherapy, and lower total RT dose. At a median follow-up of 9.3 months, median overall survival (OS) was significantly lower in patients with pre-RT sarcopenia than in those without (7.1 vs. 15.3 months,  < 0.001). In multivariate analysis [reporting hazard ratio (HR): 95% confidence interval (CI)], albumin-bilirubin score (2.35: 1.33-4.17;  = 0.003), total dose (0.44: 0.27-0.71;  = 0.001), and pre-RT sarcopenia (2.38: 1.53-3.70;  < 0.001) were independent OS prognostic factors. Among patients without pre-RT sarcopenia, 20 newly developed sarcopenia after RT and showed significantly lower OS compared to those without sarcopenia after RT ( = 35) (median 14.1 vs. 17.5 months,  = 0.018). Multivariate logistic regression analysis [reporting odds ratio (OR)] demonstrated older age (310.190;  = 0.007), Child-Pugh classification B or C (15.239;  = 0.047), higher alpha-fetoprotein (128.486;  = 0.008), higher PIVKA-II (118.536;  = 0.027), and larger planning target volume (51.310;  = 0.026) as significant factors for newly developed post-RT sarcopenia.  Newly developed sarcopenia after RT, as well as pre-RT sarcopenia, were associated with poor survival for HCC patients who underwent RT to the liver. This result suggests the possibility that early intervention such as nutritional support and exercise therapies before and during RT could prevent muscle wasting and may be effective in improving the prognosis of HCC patients.Copyright © 2019 Lee, Cho, Park, Kim and Lee.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672028>Rivaroxaban Versus Warfarin for Stroke Prevention and Venous Thromboembolism Treatment in Extreme  and High Body Weight.</a></h1><p> Limited clinical data exist describing the use of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with body mass index (BMI) >40 kg/m or body weight >120 kg. Thus, DOAC therapy in this population remains controversial.  To investigate rivaroxaban as a safe and effective alternative to warfarin for venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment and prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation identified as extremely obese or of high body weight.  A retrospective chart review was performed at 2 academic medical centers in patients ≥18 years old and BMI >40 kg/m or weight >120 kg, newly initiated on warfarin or rivaroxaban for atrial fibrillation or VTE treatment. The primary end point was incidence of clinical failure, defined as VTE recurrence, stroke incidence, and mortality, within 12 months of initiation. Secondary end points included length of stay (LOS) and bleeding complications.  A total of 176 patients were included, with 84 and 92 patients in the rivaroxaban and warfarin arms, respectively. Clinical failure was lower in the rivaroxaban group but did not reach statistical significance when compared with warfarin (5% vs 13%;  = 0.06). LOS was significantly shorter in the rivaroxaban arm (2 days [1-3] vs 4 days [2-7],  < 0.0001). Percentage of bleeding complications was higher in the rivaroxaban arm but not statistically significant (8% vs 2%,  = 0.06).  Although not statistically significant, rivaroxaban trended toward a lower incidence of clinical failure while demonstrating a significantly shorter LOS when compared with warfarin for VTE treatment or atrial fibrillation in morbidly obese or high-body-weight patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678061>Bariatric surgery and type 2 diabetes: a step closer to defining an optimal approach.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671737>Browning Effects of a Chronic Pterostilbene Supplementation in Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet.</a></h1><p> and related comorbidities are a major health concern. The drugs used to treat these conditions are largely inadequate or dangerous, and a well-researched approach based on nutraceuticals would be highly useful. Pterostilbene (Pt), i.e., 3,5-dimethylresveratrol, has been reported to be effective in animal models of , acting on different metabolic pathways. We investigate here its ability to induce browning of white adipose tissue. Pt (5 µM) was first tested on 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes, and then it was administered (352 µmol/kg/day) to mice fed an obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) for 30 weeks, starting at weaning. In the cultured adipocytes, the treatment elicited a significant increase of the levels of Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1) protein-a key component of thermogenic, energy-dissipating beige/brown adipocytes. In vivo administration antagonized weight increase, more so in males than in females. Analysis of inguinal White Adipose Tissue (WAT) revealed a trend towards browning, with significantly increased transcription of several marker genes (, , , , , and ) and an increase in UCP1 protein levels, which, however, did not achieve significance. Given the lack of known side effects of Pt, this study strengthens the candidacy of this natural phenol as an anti- nutraceutical.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677232>Five-year cumulative incidence of overweight and , and longitudinal change in body mass index in Japanese workers: The Japan Epidemiology Collaboration on Occupational Health Study.</a></h1><p>The present study aimed to estimate cumulative incidence of overweight and  and describe 5-year longitudinal changes in body mass index (BMI) in a large occupational cohort in Japan.Participants were 55 229 Japanese employees, who were aged 20-59 years and attended at all subsequent annual health check-ups between 2009 and 2014.

N = 412 patients underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) to assess the presence and characteristics of coronary atherosclerosis. A CTA score, combining extent, severity, composition, and location of plaques was computed.Patients were divided according to PCSK9 quartiles: I (< 136 ng/mL), II-III (136-266 ng/mL), and IV quartile (> 266 ng/mL). Compared with patients in quartile IV, patients in quartile I had a higher prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and higher values of body mass index. LDL- and HDL-cholesterol were significantly lower in patients in the quartile I than in those in quartile IV. Coronary CTA documented normal vessels in 30% and obstructive CAD in 35% of cases without differences among PCSK9 quartiles. Compared with patients with the highest levels, patients with the lowest PCSK9 levels had a higher CTA score mainly due to higher number of mixed non-obstructive coronary plaques. At multivariable analysis including clinical, medications, and lipid variables, PCSK9 was an independent predictor of the CTA score (coefficient - 0.129, SE 0.03, P < 0.0001), together with age, male gender, statins, interleukin-6, and leptin.In patients with stable CAD, low PCSK9 plasma levels are associated with a particular metabolic phenotype (low HDL cholesterol, the metabolic syndrome, , insulin resistance and diabetes) and diffuse non-obstructive coronary atherosclerosis.

We investigated how hypoxia interacted with adipocyte-macrophage crosstalk and inflammatory cytokine release, using co-culture and conditioned media (CM). Murine primary adipocytes from lean or obese mice were cultured under normoxic (21% O) or hypoxic (1% O) conditions. RAW264.7 macrophages were incubated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions with or without adipocyte conditioned media. Macrophage and adipocyte-macrophage co-culture CM were also collected. We found hypoxia did not elicit direct cytokine release from macrophages. However, adipocyte CM or adipocyte co-culture, synergistically stimulated TNFα and MCP-1 release from macrophages that was not further impacted by hypoxia. Exposure of muscle cells to elevated cytokines led to reduced insulin and muscle stress/inflammatory signaling. We conclude hypoxia or  induces release of inflammatory TNFα and MCP-1 from mice primary adipocytes but the two environmental conditions do not synergize to worsen macrophage signal transduction or insulin responsiveness.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The prevalence of MetS was high (44.9%), and higher among women (46.1%) than men (44.2%) (p<0.001). The prevalence increased significantly with increasing age and body mass index (BMI) in both genders (p<0.001). However, metabolically obese but normal weight individuals (MONW) (8.4%) were also identified, with a slight increase among women (9.4%) compared with men (7.5%) (p=0.56). MetS was more likely to be prevalent among participants with increased fasting blood sugar (5.8 times), increased triglyceride (7.4 times), increased blood pressure (4.5 times) and BMI ≥25 (19.9 times) (p<0.001). The prevalence of MetS was higher among rural (50.3%) vs urban (39.3%) residents and refugees (33.8%).With increasing age and , clustering of MetS components increased remarkably in both genders. Effective prevention and treatment strategies for MetS and its risk factors should be developed targeting different ages and genders.© The Author(s) 2019.

This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and disability, severity, frequency and duration of headaches in female migraine patients.This cross-sectional study was designed to address the characteristics of migraine attacks (duration of each attack, frequency, and severity) and MIDAS (Migraine Disability Assessment) score in female migraineurs. The diagnosis of migraine was based on ICHD-3 beta criteria. Verbal rating scale (VRS) was used for headache severity. Height and weight were measured to calculate the BMI. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for comparison of means, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) test was used for adjustment of the confounding factors.In the current study, 170 female migraine patients with a mean (±SD) age of 34.0 ± 8.0 years were enrolled. There were significant differences between the three groups (18.5 ≤ BMI< 25, 25 ≤ BMI < 30 and 30 ≤ BMI) in terms of headache frequency, duration and severity as well as total MIDAS score (P<0.001). These differences remained significant after adjustment for age.This study revealed that migraineurs with higher BMI experienced higher headache frequency, severity and duration as well as higher disability score.© 2019 The Author(s).

Metabolic activation of WAT may ascribe to this tissue characteristics of BAT, namely non-shivering thermogenesis and ATP production. Recent data indicate that apolipoproteins E (APOE) and A1 (APOA1) regulate WAT mitochondrial metabolic activation. Here, we investigated the functional cross-talk between natural human APOE2 and APOE4 isoforms with APOA1 in this process, using Apoe2 and Apoe4 mice. At baseline when Apoe2 and Apoe4 mice express both APOE and Apoa1, the Apoe2 strain appears to have higher mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation levels and non-shivering thermogenesis in WAT compared to Apoe4 mice. When mice were switched to a high-fat diet for 18 weeks, circulating levels of endogenous Apoa1 in Apoe2 mice became barely detectable though significant levels of APOE2 were still present. This change was accompanied by a significant reduction in WAT mitochondrial Ucp1 expression while BAT Ucp1 was unaffected. Ectopic APOA1 expression in Apoe2 animals potently stimulated WAT but not BAT mitochondrial Ucp1 expression providing further evidence that APOA1 potently stimulates WAT non-shivering thermogenesis in the presence of APOE2. Ectopic expression of APOA1 in Apoe4 mice stimulated BAT but no WAT mitochondrial Ucp1 levels, suggesting that in the presence of APOE4, APOA1 is a trigger of BAT non-shivering thermogenesis. Overall, our data identified a tissue-specific role of the natural human APOE2 and APOE4 isoforms in WAT- and BAT-metabolic activation respectively, that appears dependent on circulating APOA1 levels.Copyright © 2019.

In the pediatric population, diagnosis of CD is rare and cyclic presentations of the disease are not adequately understood or described. Moreover, prepubertal patients usually do not present with the typical signs and symptoms of CD, which can obscure or delay diagnosis. In this paper, we report a case of cyclic CD in a prepubertal age girls whose etiology was a pituitary corticotropinoma.  A Caucasian 7.8 year old girl was admitted to pediatric endocrinology for the evaluation of short stature and prior . The patient remained overweight despite significant lifestyle modifications, resulting in 6 kg weight loss during the prior 6 months. The physical exam was notable for precocious adrenarche and thelarche, but difficult to differentiate from steatomastia. Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis diagnostics, including single diurnal excretion of urinary cortisol, morning ACTH, and serum cortisol levels, were all within normal limits, and MRI of the pituitary gland showed no deviations at this time. Because of the clinical suspicion of cyclic hypercortisolemia, she was referred to our outpatient clinic for follow-up. After 6 months, the patient returned with rapid weight gain, accompanied by nocturnal anxiety, exacerbation of depressive behavior, insomnia and excessive sweating, and was readmitted to the ward for testing. Standard diagnostics confirmed CD and repeat MRI at 8.6 years old showed a microadenoma of 3 × 4 mm in the right side of the anterior pituitary gland. Histopathologic examination described an atypical, densely-granulated pituitary corticotroph adenoma with Ki-67 expression above 3%.  Cyclic presentations of CD in the prepubescent age group could cause difficulties in diagnosis because of atypical signs and symptoms, which can be absent in the remission phase. Decreases in height percentiles and velocities obtained from the growth chart, as well as fluctuations in weight, and signs of androgenization can allow the clinician to suspect cycling CD in prepubertal patients. Confirmation of cyclic CD diagnosis is only possible during periods of relapse (hypercortisolemic state) and should be investigated according to the current diagnostic standard.Copyright © 2019 Wȩdrychowicz, Hull, Kalicka-Kasperczyk, Zieliński and Starzyk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680091>Correlates of diabetic retinopathy: A case study.</a></h1><p>Prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing worldwide particularly in developing countries as according to International Diabetes Federation, globally a rise from 451 million diabetic people in 2017 to 693 million in 2045 is expected. Diabetic retinopathy is one of the major consequences of diabetes mellitus, so knowing its risk factors can be very helpful. For identifying the risk factors of the Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) in Faisalabad and to determine whether DR is more caused by type 1 or type 2 diabetes, a cross-sectional study was conducted at major hospitals in Faisalabad district during February-July 2016. Descriptive statistics were used for initial screening of the significant variables. Then binary logistic regression was applied to measure the influence of different factors on likelihood of DR. Using Odds Ratio (OR) from logistic regression as measure of influence, the problem of DR was found to be higher among males (OR=1.913; 95% C.I, 1.072~3.413), married patients (OR=5.678; 95% C.I=2.206~14.616), patients with type 1 diabetes (OR=2.195; 95% C.I=1.205~3.997), patients with  (OR=25.736; 95% C.I=11.033~60.031), patients using insulin treatment (OR=6.678; 95% C.I=2.330~10.138). The study demonstrated a high prevalence of DR in Faisalabad. Eye examination, social status of patients and duration of diabetes were also found as significant variables affecting DR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673045>Hepatic Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 deficiency-mediated activation of mTORC1- PGC-1α axis regulates ER stress during high-carbohydrate feeding.</a></h1><p>Stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is a key enzyme in lipogenesis as it catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), mainly oleate (18:1n9) and palmitoleate (16:1n7) from saturated fatty acids (SFA), stearate (18:0) and palmitate (16:0), respectively. Studies on SCD1 deficiency in mouse models demonstrated beneficial metabolic phenotypes such as reduced adiposity and improved glucose tolerance. Even though, SCD1 represents a potential target to resolve  related metabolic diseases; SCD1 deficiency causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activates unfolded protein response (UPR). The induction of ER stress in response to SCD1 deficiency is governed by the cofactor, PGC-1α. However, the mechanism by which SCD1 deficiency increases PGC-1α and subsequently induces ER stress still remains elusive. The present study demonstrates that despite reduced lipogenesis, liver specific SCD1 deficiency activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) along with induction of PGC-1α and ER stress. Further, mTORC1 inhibition attenuates SCD1 deficiency-mediated induction of both PGC-1α and ER stress. Similar observations were seen by restoring endogenously synthesized oleate, but not palmitoleate, suggesting a clear mTORC1-mediated regulation of ER stress during SCD1 deficiency. Overall, our results suggest a model whereby maintaining adequate levels of hepatic oleate is required to suppress mTORC1-mediated ER stress. In addition, the activation of mTORC1 by SCD1 deficiency reveals an important function of fatty acids in regulating different cellular processes through mTORC1 signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682731>Environmental, social, and economic factors related to the intersection of food security, dietary quality, and : an introduction to a special issue of the Translational Behavioral Medicine journal.</a></h1><p>This special issue of Translational Behavioral Medicine solicited papers focusing on the intersection of food security, dietary quality, and . Specifically, the special issue seeks to highlight research that provides actionable takeaways related to policy, systems, and environmental (PSE) approaches for practitioners and policymakers. The purpose of this introduction was to summarize relevant background literature and then briefly introduce topics covered by the articles included in the special issue. There are economic, environmental, and social factors that create systemic barriers that drive persistent poverty in communities and underlay the intersection of food security, dietary quality, and . Although equitable healthful food access is needed, the issue is exceedingly complicated. Understanding and operationalizing effective and efficient PSE approaches is in its infancy. More research is needed to better understand how to appropriately measure determinants of health (and how they relate to the conditions that ultimately promote  through food insecurity and compromises to dietary quality), implement deliberate interventions that address the underlying factors, and disseminate that information to policymakers and practitioners in the field. This special issue of Translational Behavioral Medicine includes articles that relay practical findings, measurement methods, and lessons learned related to PSE approaches such as federal food assistance programs (e.g., National School Lunch Program), systems-based interventions (e.g., clinic-community connections), and environmental modifications(e.g., food retail marketing). Although much more practical and action-oriented research is needed in this area, these articles will contribute to the evidence base supporting better future assessment and PSE interventions that address food security, dietary quality, and .© Society of Behavioral Medicine 2019.

Specifically, Translator team members self-organized and worked together to conceptualize and execute, over a five-day period, a multi-institutional clinical research study that aimed to examine, using open clinical data sources, relationships between sex, , diabetes, and exposure to airborne fine particulate matter among patients with severe asthma. The goal was to develop a proof of concept that this new model of collaboration and data sharing could effectively produce meaningful scientific results and generate new scientific hypotheses. Three Translator Clinical Knowledge Sources, each of which provides open access (via Application Programming Interfaces) to data derived from the electronic health record systems of major academic institutions, served as the source of study data. Jupyter Python notebooks, shared in GitHub repositories, were used to call the knowledge sources and analyze and integrate the results. The results replicated established or suspected relationships between sex, , diabetes, exposure to airborne fine particulate matter, and severe asthma. In addition, the results demonstrated specific differences across the three Translator Clinical Knowledge Sources, suggesting cohort- and/or environment-specific factors related to the services themselves or the catchment area from which each service derives patient data. Collectively, this special communication demonstrates the power and utility of intense, team-oriented hackathons and offers general technical, organizational, and scientific lessons learned.Copyright © 2019.

It is of utmost importance to accurately and objectively assess the efficiency of a healthcare system and to note the key indicators, where resources are lost, and possibilities for improvement. This paper evaluates the efficiency of health systems in 38 countries, mainly members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, using data envelopment analysis (DEA). In the first stage, bootstrapped Ivanovic distance is used to generate weights for the indicators, thus taking into consideration different country's goals, but not to the extent of reducing the possibility of comparison. The analysis shows that human resources are the most important health system resource and countries should pay special attention to developing and employing competent medical workers. The reorganization of human resources and the funds allocated to them could also increase efficiency. The second stage examines environmental indicators to find the causes of inefficiency. No proof is found that any one basic health system funding model produces better health outcomes than the others.  is identified as a major issue.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681211>Cross-Regional View of Functional and Taxonomic Microbiota Composition in  and Post- Treatment Shows Country Specific Microbial Contribution.</a></h1><p>Gut microbiota has been shown to have an important influence on host health. The microbial composition of the human gut microbiota is modulated by diet and other lifestyle habits and it has been reported that microbial diversity is altered in obese people.  is a worldwide health problem that negatively impacts the quality of life. Currently, the widespread treatment for  is bariatric surgery. Interestingly, gut microbiota has been shown to be a relevant factor in effective weight loss after bariatric surgery. Since that the human gut microbiota of normal subjects differs between geographic regions, it is possible that rearrangements of the gut microbiota in dysbiosis context are also region-specific. To better understand how gut microbiota contribute to , this study compared the composition of the human gut microbiota of obese and lean people from six different regions and showed that the microbiota compositions in the context of  were specific to each studied geographic location. Furthermore, we analyzed the functional patterns using shotgun DNA metagenomic sequencing and compared the results with other -related metagenomic studies, we observed that microbial contribution to functional pathways were country-specific. Nevertheless, our study showed that although microbial composition of obese patients was country-specific, the overall metabolic functions appeared to be the same between countries, indicating that different microbiota components contribute to similar metabolic outcomes to yield functional redundancy. Furthermore, we studied the microbiota functional changes of obese patients after bariatric surgery, by shotgun metagenomics sequencing and observed that changes in functional pathways were specific to the type of  treatment. In all, our study provides new insights into the differences and similarities of obese gut microbiota in relation to geographic location and  treatments.Copyright © 2019 Medina, Li, Thomson, Artacho, Pérez-Brocal and Moya.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678111>Heat shock response to exercise in pancreatic islets of obese mice.</a></h1><p>Chronic  imposes an organismal state of low-grade inflammation because the physiological resolution of inflammation is progressively repressed giving rise to cellular senescence and its accompanying Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), which avoids apoptosis but perpetuates the relay of inflammatory signals from adipose tissue toward the rest the body. Conversely, resolution of inflammation depends on the integrity of heat shock response (HSR) pathway that leads to the expression of cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory protein chaperones of the 70 kDa family (HSP70). However, chronic exposure to the aforementioned injuring factors leads to SASP, which, in turn, suppress the HSR. A main metabolic tissue severely jeopardized by -related dysfunctions is the endocrine pancreas, particularly β-cells of the islets of Langerhans. Because exercise is a powerful inducer of HSR and predicted to alleviate negative health outcomes of , we sought whether  influence HSP70 expression in pancreatic islets and other metabolic tissues (adipose tissue and skeletal muscle) of adult B6.129SF2/J mice fed on a high-fat diet (HFD) for 13 weeks since the weaning and whether acute exercise as well as moderate-intensity exercise training (8 weeks) could interfere with this scenario. We showed that acute exercise of moderate intensity protects pancreatic islets against cytokine-induced cell death. In addition, acute exercise challenge time-dependently increased islet HSP70 that peaked at 12 h post-exercise in both trained and untrained mice fed on a control diet, suggesting an adequate HSR to exercise training. Unexpectedly, however, neither exercise training nor acute exercise challenges were able to increase islet HSP70 contents in trained mice submitted to HFD, but only in untrained HFD animals. In parallel, HFD disrupted glycemic status which is accompanied by loss of muscular mass resembling sarcopenic  that could not be rescued by exercise training. These results suggest that exercise influences HSR in pancreatic islets but  undermines islet, muscle and adipose tissue HSR, which is associated with metabolic abnormalities observed in such tissues.Copyright © 2019.

A progressively higher number of children and adolescents is affected by this syndrome worldwide, mainly as a consequence of the constant increase of the prevalence of  and sedentary habits. As , the chance that the metabolic syndrome traks into adulthood is high. Moreover, the evidence of an association between the duration of the exposition to metabolic risk factors and morbidity and mortality justifies early treatment and prevention of the metabolic syndrome in both children and adolescents. Treatment includes behavioral interventions, adequate nutrition and physical activity, and, if necessary, pharmacological treatments aimed at reducing excessive weight, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and glucose impairments. A multidisciplinary and staged approach to treatment, which includes pediatrician, mental health practitioner, dietician, and nurses, is crucial. Usually, the reduction of fat mass promotes an overall improvement of all the components of the metabolic syndrome. Nevertheless, every single component of the metabolic syndrome should be treated as quickly as possible, by using the best current practice. Drugs may be necessary for treating hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia.

SOD3 expression and release were evaluated in adipocytes differentiated from primary human preadipocytes and murine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. The regulatory role for SOD3 was determined by SOD3 lentivirus knockdown in human adipocytes and global SOD3 KO mice. SOD3 was expressed at high levels in white adipose tissue and adipocytes were the main cells expressing SOD3 in adipose tissue. SOD3 expression was significantly elevated in adipose tissue of HFD-fed mice. Moreover, SOD3 expression and release were markedly increased in differentiated human adipocytes and adipocytes differentiated from mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells compared to undifferentiated cells. In addition, SOD3 silencing in human adipocytes increased expression of genes involved in lipid metabolic pathways such as PPARγ and SREBP1c and promoted the accumulation of triglyceride. Finally, global SOD3 KO mice were more obese and insulin resistant with enlarged adipose tissue and increased triglyceride accumulation.Our data showed that SOD3 is secreted from adipocytes and regulates lipid metabolism in adipose tissue.

It is therefore recommended to inform women with a breech presentation at term that ECV should be attempt (Professional consensus). ECV attempt should be performed with immediate access to an operating room for emergency cesarean (Professional consensus). The ECV attempt before 37 weeks, compared to ECV attempt after 37 weeks, increases the rate of cephalic presentation at birth (LE2) but with a small increase risk of moderate prematurity (LE2). ECV attempt should be performed from 36SA (Professional consensus). The main factors associated with successful ECV attempt are multiparity (LE3) and no maternal  (LE3). Parenteral tocolysis (β mimetic or atosiban) for ECV attempt at term is associated with a higher success rate (LE2), higher rate of achieved cephalic presentation in labor (LE2) and a lower cesarean section rate (LE2). It is recommended to use parenteral tocolysis for ECV attempt at term in order to increase its success rate (Grade B). The ECV attempt is associated with an increase in transient FHR abnormalities (LE3), it is therefore recommended that cardiotocography should be performed prior and during 30 minutes after the procedure (Professional consensus). There is no argument for recommending the practice of delayed cardiotocography after ECV attempt (Professional consensus). The risk of significant positivity (> 30mL) of the Kleihauer test after ECV attempt is low (<0.1%) (LE3), it is not recommended to systematically perform a Kleihauer test after ECV attempt (Professional consensus). In case of RH-1 negative women, it is recommended to ensure systematic RH-1 prophylaxis (Professional consensus). In case of breech presentation at term, acupuncture, moxibustion and postural methods are not effective in reducing breech presentation at birth (LE2), and are therefore not recommended (Grade B).According to the clear benefits and the low risks of ECV attempt, all women with a breech presentation at term should be informed that ECV should be attempted to decrease breech presentation at birth and cesarean section.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We evaluated SC function by assessing IB and AMH levels at baseline and after three months of each treatment in ten dysmetabolic obese subjects with low T levels. In all subjects,the influence of the clinical characteristics, metabolic and hormonal baseline parameters on SC and Leydig (LC) function, evaluated respectively with AMH, IB, FSH and T levels, were tested.No significant changes were observed for IB and AMH concentrations after each treatment period. Whereas T and estradiol (E2) levels were shown to be significantly higher in the CC plus metformin phase (CC/Met) only. No clinical, metabolic or hormonal parameters showed significant effects on serum AMH at baseline or after treatments. However, baseline T, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) andE2 positively affected IB levels during CC/Met therapy (P=0.003, P=0.038 and P=0.049 respectively). Baseline leptin, and FSH had a negative (P=0,031) and positive (P=0.048) respectively role on T levels during CC/Met, as they were statistically significant compared to the placebo period (Plac/Met).Unlike the LC activity, CC was unable to influence SC function, as shown by the lack of IB and AMH serum modifications, thus suggesting an intrinsic non-reversible defect of SC cells in patients with dysmetabolic conditions.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672576>Performance of a selective screening strategy for diagnosis of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy as defined by IADPSG/WHO criteria.</a></h1><p>Our study evaluated the performance of a selective screening strategy for hyperglycaemia in pregnancy (HIP) based on the presence of risk factors (RFs; body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m², age ≥ 35 years, family history of diabetes, personal history of HIP or macrosomia) to diagnose HIP and to predict HIP-related events.Women with no known diabetes who had undergone complete universal screening (early, before 22 weeks of gestation or, if not, in the second part of pregnancy) at our department (2012-2016) were selected, resulting in four groups of women according to the presence of HIP and/or RFs, with a predefined composite endpoint (preeclampsia or large-for-gestational-age infant or shoulder dystocia).Included were 4518 women: 23.5% had HIP and 71.1% had at least one RF.

Incidence of the composite endpoint differed significantly (P < 0.0001) across groups [HIP-/RF- 6.3%; HIP-/RF+ 13.2%; HIP+/RF- 8.6%; and HIP+/RF+ 17.1% (HIP effect: P < 0.05; RF effect: P < 0.001; interaction HIP * RF: P = 0.94)] and significantly increased with the number of RFs (no RF: 6.3%, 1 RF: 10.8%, 2 RFs: 14.7%, 3 RFs: 28.0%, 4-5 RFs: 25.0%; P < 0.0001).RFs are predictive of HIP, although 15.4% of women with HIP have no RFs. Also, irrespective of HIP status, RFs are predictive of HIP-related events, suggesting that overweight/, the only modifiable RFs, could be targets of interventions to improve pregnancy prognosis.Copyright © 2019.

In rodents 11βHSD1 converts inert 11-dehydrocorticosterone (11-DHC), to the active form, corticosterone (CORT). A sensitive, specific liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was sought to simultaneously quantify total 11-DHC and total and free CORT in murine plasma for simple assessment of 11βHSD1 activity in murine models.Mass Spectrometry parameters were optimised and the chromatographic separation of CORT and 11-DHC was developed. Murine plasma was prepared by 10:1 chloroform liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) for analysis. Limits of Quantitation (LOQs), linearity and other method criteria were assessed, according to bioanalytical method validation guidelines.Reliable separation of 11-DHC and CORT was achieved, using an ACE Excel 2 C18-AR (2.1 x 150 mm; 2 󠇆μm) fused core column at 25 C, with an acidified water; acetonitrile gradient over 10 minutes. Analytes were detected by multiple reaction monitoring after positive electrospray ionization (m/z 345.1.1➔ 121.2, m/z 347.1➔121.1 for 11-DHC and CORT, respectively). The LOQs were 0.25 and 0.20 ng/mL for 11-DHC and CORT, respectively.This LC/MS method is suitable for the reliable analysis of 11-DHC and CORT following simple LLE of murine plasma, bringing preclinical analysis in line with recommendations for clinical endocrinology and biochemistry.This article is protected by copyright.

This overview outlines and discusses the impaired insulin responses to GIP as well as the effect of GIP on glucagon secretion and the potential involvement of GIP in  and bone disease associated with type 2 diabetes. As outlined in this review, it is unlikely that impaired insulinotropic effects of GIP occur as a primary event in the development of type 2 diabetes, but rather develop once the diabetic state is present and beta cells are unable to maintain normoglycemia. In various models, GIP has effects on glucagon secretion, bone and lipid homeostasis, but whether these effects contribute substantially to the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes is at present controversial. The review also discusses the substantial uncertainty surrounding the translation of preclinical data relating to the GIP system and outline future research directions.Copyright © 2019.

This study was designed to assess the prevalence of food exclusions as well as the reasons for such exclusions in a large group of IBS patients.In this cross-sectional study, data on 3846 Iranian adults, 828 of whom were patients with IBS, working in 50 different health centers were examined. A 106-item self-administered Dish-based Semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (DSFFQ) which was designed and validated specifically for Iranian adults was used for assessing dietary intake. IBS was assessed using a modified Persian version of the Rome III questionnaire.The whole prevalence of IBS was 21.5% (n = 828) in the total population (23.9% in women and 18.6% in men). Mean age of patients with IBS was 36.26 ± 7.91 years and for subjects without IBS, it was 36.52 ± 8.12 years. IBS patients had a greater probability to avoid consumption of ketchup (90% vs 33%, P = 0.005), Dough (100% vs 1%, P = 0.003), Gaz (50% vs. 1%, P = 0.035), grapes (33% vs. 7%, P = 0.034), fresh berries (56% vs. 14%, P = 0.036) and butter (100% vs. 60%, P = 0.02) due to gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms compared with healthy individuals. Although, the exclusion of plum (1% vs. 26%, P = 0.006), pickles (39% vs. 67%, P = 0.004), lemon juice (21% vs 35%, P = 0.027), egg (5% vs. 25%, P = 0.011), fresh fig (19% vs. 44%, P = 0.038) and cake (25% vs. 100%, P = 0.028) due to GI symptoms in IBS patients were lower than non-IBS participants.The present study showed that IBS patients were more likely to avoid consumption of ketchup, Dough, Gaz, grapes, fresh berries and butter due to GI symptoms compared with healthy individuals. Further studies are required to confirm these findings.© 2019 The Author(s).

In obese non-diabetic adolescents, we investigated if the OGTT-time-to-glucose-peak also reflects incretin and free fatty acid (FFA) responses besides insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, measured by the clamp.Obese adolescents (n=278) were categorized according to their OGTT-time-to-glucose-peak by Early-peak (at 30 min) vs. Late-peak (>30 min) groups. Body composition, visceral adipose tissue, oral disposition index (oDI) and OGTT-area under the curve (AUC) were examined. A subset of 102 participants had both hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps to measure in vivo insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity.Compared with the Early-peak group, the Late-peak group had impaired β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity, lower glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)-AUC, and higher FFA-AUC despite higher insulin and C-peptide-AUC. They also had lower hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity despite similar percent body fat and visceral adipose tissue, and had higher prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (all P<0.05).In obese non-diabetic youth, those with a Late-peak vs. an Early-peak glucose during an OGTT showed diminished β-cell function, blunted incretin secretion, and lower insulin sensitivity of glucose and FFA metabolism. It remains to be determined if Late-peak glucose predicts the future development of type 2 diabetes in these high-risk youth. This article is protected by copyright.

Machine learning algorithms have been shown to effectively analyze well characterized datasets.In this study, we used machine learning algorithms to determine top predictors of non-calcified coronary burden by CCTA in psoriasis.The analysis included 263 consecutive patients with 62 available variables from the Psoriasis Atherosclerosis Cardiometabolic Initiative. The random forest algorithm was utilized to determine top predictors of non-calcified coronary burden by CCTA. We evaluated our results using linear regression models.Using the random forest algorithm, the top 10 predictors of non-calcified coronary burden were: body mass index, visceral adiposity, total adiposity, apolipoprotein A1, high-density lipoprotein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, subcutaneous adiposity, small low-density lipoprotein particle and cholesterol efflux capacity. Linear regression of non-calcified coronary burden yielded results consistent with our machine learning output.We were unable to provide external validation and did not study cardiovascular events.Machine learning methods identified top predictors of non-calcified coronary burden in psoriasis. These factors were related to , dyslipidemia, and inflammation demonstrating that these are important targets to treat comorbidities in psoriasis.Copyright © 2019.

Thus, based on the different opinions on the efficaciousness of morbid  treatments, the aim of the present study was to estimate the association of serum ghrelin and Met-enkephalins (native, five amino acids and cryptic, precursor of enkephalin) concentrations with BMI value in bariatric patients within 30 postoperative days.Study were performed on 38 female patients divided into two groups: I.BMI lower than 40 kg/m2 (n=18) and II. BMI higher than 40 kg/m2 (n=20). Blood was taken before (-24h), 72 h and 30 days after the sleeve gastrectomy. Routine hematologic, anthropometric and metabolic parameters as well as TSH, ghrelin and Met-enkephalins values were measured in all patients.There were statistically significant differences between two groups before the surgery in terms of TSH, both forms of Met-enkephalin, triglycerides concentrations, activity of ALT, GGTP and CRP. After 72 h, the serum levels of cryptic Met-enkephalin, CRP and activity of enzymes varied between the two groups of patients. Thirty days after the surgery, some metabolic and immune parameters were still different in both female groups in favour of patients with lover BMI. However, significant differences were noticed in the levels of ghrelin (increase), native (decrease) and cryptic Met-enkephalins (increase).The activity of endogenous peptides in bariatric patients is connected with the  degree. Ghrelin level increases are negatively correlated with native Met-enkephalin changes shortly after bariatric surgery.

Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) was performed by 1 surgeon, and data were collected by 1 researcher. Demographics, medical history, number of deliveries, and type of bariatric surgery (SG or RYGB) were collected at baseline. At the 1-year follow-up consultation, postoperative complications, percentage of total body weight loss (TWL) and percentage excess weight loss were assessed. Questionnaires were given at baseline and at 1-year follow-up.Postoperative complications and total weight loss were measured at the 1-year follow-up. Sexual activity, using the PISQ-IR, and pelvic organ prolapse, urinary incontinence, and anal incontinence, using the urinary symptom profile and PFDI (Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory) 20, were compared before surgery and at 1-year follow-up.72 patients were included at baseline, 54 (75%) were considered for final analysis (30 RYGB and 24 SG), and 51 patients were considered for PISQ-IR. The mean preoperative body mass index was 41 ± 5.4 kg/m, and mean age was 43 ± 11.8 years. Both procedures induced an important weight loss (mean TWL of 33%) and had a similar percentage of TWL for each procedure: 31 (15-46) for SG vs 34 (9-51) for RYGB. 9 patients (17 [6%]) became sexually active 1 year after surgery. For the sexually inactive population after 1 year, there was no differences in the PISQ-IR in the follow-up. When body mass index loss was >13 kg/m, a higher percentage of the sexually active population improved their different scores, and there were significant results for both global quality of life and desire (P = .026 and .046).

Although laboratory studies have established that sleep loss is associated with increased caloric intake, the critical question of how habitual at-home sleep duration influences total caloric and macronutrient intake during subsequent total sleep deprivation remains largely unexplored.At-home sleep patterns were monitored via wrist actigraphy for at least one week before a 29-h in-laboratory total sleep deprivation (TSD) session (N = 45). Participants had ad-libitum access to food, which was measured at 6-h intervals throughout the in-laboratory session.Short habitual sleep duration was significantly associated with increased caloric and macronutrient intake during the last 6 h of TSD (06:00-12:00).Short habitual sleep increases the risk for morning overeating after acute sleep deprivation. Early identification and behavioral intervention of those at risk of overeating may help reduce the likelihood of long-term health consequences.Copyright © 2019 National Sleep Foundation.

An increasing number of environmental factors from nutrition to toxicants have been shown to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. Previous observations have demonstrated that the agricultural fungicide vinclozolin and pesticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) induce transgenerational sperm epimutations involving DNA methylation, ncRNA, and histone modifications or retention. These two environmental toxicants were used to investigate the impacts of parent-of-origin outcross on the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. Male and female rats were collected from a paternal outcross (POC) or a maternal outcross (MOC) F4 generation control and exposure lineages for pathology and epigenetic analysis. This model allows the parental allelic transmission of disease and epimutations to be investigated. There was increased pathology incidence in the MOC F4 generation male prostate, kidney, , and multiple diseases through a maternal allelic transmission. The POC F4 generation female offspring had increased pathology incidence for kidney,  and multiple types of diseases through the paternal allelic transmission. Some disease such as testis or ovarian pathology appear to be transmitted through the combined actions of both male and female alleles. Analysis of the F4 generation sperm epigenomes identified differential DNA methylated regions (DMRs) in a genome-wide analysis. Observations demonstrate that DDT and vinclozolin have the potential to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and sperm epimutations to the outcross F4 generation in a sex specific and exposure specific manner. The parent-of-origin allelic transmission observed appears similar to the process involved with imprinted-like genes.Copyright © 2019.

The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the energy status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by insulin and amino acid availability, and its metabolic actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing resistance to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive inflammation and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino acid supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; 2) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To evaluate the joint effects of long-term PM (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 1.0 μm) exposure and  on children's lung function, a cross-sectional sample of 6740 children (aged 7-14 years) was enrolled across seven northeastern Chinese cities from 2012 to 2013. Weight and lung function, including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and maximal mid-expiratory flow (MMEF), were measured according to standardized protocols. Average PM, PM, PM and nitrogen dioxide (NO) exposure levels were estimated using a spatiotemporal model, and sulphur dioxide (SO) and ozone (O) exposure were estimated using data from municipal air monitoring stations. Two-level logistic regression and general linear models were used to analyze the joint effects of body mass index (BMI) and air pollutants.

Data were collected and analyzed from May 23, 2016, through November 13, 2017, based on intention to treat.All participants were advised to weigh themselves daily, with a goal of 6 or more days per week, and received text messaging feedback on their performance. Incentive group participants were eligible for a lottery-based incentive worth an expected value of $3.98 in week 1 that escalated by $0.43 each week they achieved their self-weighing goal during months 1 to 6 (phase 1), followed by no incentives during months 7 to 12 (phase 2).The primary outcome was weight change at the end of phase 1. Secondary outcomes included weight change at the end of phase 2 and changes in self-reported physical activity and eating behaviors.A total of 258 participants (128 in the incentive group and 130 in the control group) had a mean (SD) age of 48.0 (10.5) years and mean (SD) body mass index of 32.1 (3.9); 225 (87.2%) were women; 235 (91.1%) were white; and 102 (39.5%) had an annual income of at least $100 000. Weight measurement was transmitted by 250 participants (96.9%) at 6 months and 227 (88.0%) at 12 months. The percentage of weeks that incentive and control participants achieved a mean self-weighing of at least 6 times was 85.3% vs 75.8%, respectively (P = .002) in phase 1 and 37.7% vs 50.2%, respectively (P = .009) in phase 2. Mean weight changes at the end of phase 1 were -1.1 (95% CI, -2.1 to -0.1) kg in the incentive group and -1.9 (95% CI, -2.9 to -0.8) kg in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.7 (95% CI, -0.7 to 2.2) kg (P = .30 for comparison). At the end of phase 2, mean weight changes were 0.2 (95% CI, -1.2 to 1.7) kg in the incentive group and -0.6 (95% CI, -2.0 to 0.8) kg in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.8 (95% CI, -1.2 to 2.8) kg (P = .41 for comparison).Compared with an active control condition of weekly messages, escalating lottery-based incentives transiently increased rates of self-weighing but did not significantly enhance weight loss maintenance.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679650>Multivariate Genome-Wide Association Analysis of a Cytokine Network Reveals Variants with Widespread Immune, Haematological, and Cardiometabolic Pleiotropy.</a></h1><p>Cytokines are essential regulatory components of the immune system, and their aberrant levels have been linked to many disease states. Despite increasing evidence that cytokines operate in concert, many of the physiological interactions between cytokines, and the shared genetic architecture that underlies them, remain unknown. Here, we aimed to identify and characterize genetic variants with pleiotropic effects on cytokines. Using three population-based cohorts (n = 9,263), we performed multivariate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for a correlation network of 11 circulating cytokines, then combined our results in meta-analysis. We identified a total of eight loci significantly associated with the cytokine network, of which two (PDGFRB and ABO) had not been detected previously. In addition, conditional analyses revealed a further four secondary signals at three known cytokine loci. Integration, through the use of Bayesian colocalization analysis, of publicly available GWAS summary statistics with the cytokine network associations revealed shared causal variants between the eight cytokine loci and other traits; in particular, cytokine network variants at the ABO, SERPINE2, and ZFPM2 loci showed pleiotropic effects on the production of immune-related proteins, on metabolic traits such as lipoprotein and lipid levels, on blood-cell-related traits such as platelet count, and on disease traits such as coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Human Genetics.

Low socioeconomic status has been associated with a higher body mass index. However, the pathways underlying this complex relationship are poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the possible mediation and/or moderation effects of complexity of knowledge about healthy eating, and self-regulation processes towards healthy eating, in the association between family's income and weight of elementary school age children. The results showed that complexity of knowledge does not mediate the relationship between socioeconomic status and weight. Still, whenever the levels of complexity of knowledge and self-regulation are high, there is a moderation effect of complexity of knowledge on the relationship between family's income and weight, conditioned by self-regulation scores. These promising findings support the idea that knowledge about healthy eating in isolation could be insufficient for practicing a healthy diet and underline the relevance of combining transmission of knowledge with training in specific competences (e.g., self-regulation strategies). Considering that complexity of knowledge about healthy eating and self-regulation strategies are interrelated and can be both improved, future preventive interventions could consider incorporating both in their design to mitigate childhood .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679693>Identification of isotschimgine as a novel farnesoid X receptor agonist with potency for the treatment of  in mice.</a></h1><p> and its associated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have become epidemic medical problems worldwide; however, the current available therapeutic options are limited. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) has recently emerged as an attractive target for  treatment. Here we demonstrate that isotschimgine (ITG), a constituent in genus Ferula, as a novel FXR agonist with anti- and anti-hepatic steatosis effects. The results showed that ITG activated the FXR transactivity and bound with the ligand binding dormain (LBD) of FXR with gene reporter assays and AlphaScreen assays. In high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, ITG lowered body weight and fat mass, improved insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Mechanistic studies showed that ITG altered the expression levels of FXR downstream genes, lipid synthesis and energy metabolism genes in the liver of mice. Our findings suggest that ITG is a novel FXR agonist and may be a potential therapeutic choice for  associated with NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Food items collected through two 24-h recalls were classified according to the NOVA system. The contribution of each NOVA food group and their subgroups to total energy intake was determined by age group. Mean free sugar content in diet fractions made up exclusively of ultra-processed foods, or of processed foods, or of a combination of un/minimally processed foods and culinary ingredients (which includes table sugar and honey) were compared. Across quintiles of the energy contribution of ultra-processed foods, differences in the intake of free sugars, as well as in the prevalence of excessive free sugar intake (≥ 10% of total energy) were examined.Ultra-processed foods had the highest energy contribution among children, adolescents and adults in Australia, with older children and adolescents the highest consumers (53.1% and 54.3% of total energy, respectively). The diet fraction restricted to ultra-processed items contained significantly more free sugars than the two other diet fractions. Among all age groups, a positive and statistically significant linear association was found between quintiles of ultra-processed food consumption and both the average intake of free sugars and the prevalence of excessive free sugar intake.Ultra-processed food consumption drives excessive free sugar intake among all age groups in Australia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682151>Parent Food-Related Behaviors and Family-Based Dietary and Activity Environments: Associations with BMI z-Scores in Low-Income Preschoolers.</a></h1><p> In early childhood, the family dietary and activity environment and parent food-related practices have been found to be important predictors of children's weight. However, few studies account for both of these factors, or the interaction between the 2, when assessing BMI in early childhood. This study aims to examine the association between the family-based dietary and activity environment (including intake, physical activity, and structure) and children's BMI z-scores in the context of parent food-related behaviors in low-income families during the preschool years.  Parents ( = 111) completed questionnaires assessing the family-based dietary and activity environment, including diet, physical activity, screentime and sleep, and their use of parent food-related behaviors including parent-centered (, controlling) and child-centered (, autonomy supportive) practices. Children's BMI z-scores were calculated from researcher-measured height and weight.  Parent-centered food-related behaviors were directly related to children's BMI z-scores and moderated the association between the family-based dietary and activity environment and children's BMI z-scores. Family-based behaviors were associated with lower BMI only when parents used fewer parent-centered behaviors.  Findings indicate that programs working with low-income families to prevent child  should stress both the creation of a healthy home environment and the use of positive parent food-related behaviors with preschool aged children.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672329>From mitochondria to healthy aging: The role of branched-chain amino acids treatment: MATeR a randomized study.</a></h1><p>Malnutrition often affects elderly patients and significantly contributes to the reduction in healthy life expectancy, causing high morbidity and mortality. In particular, protein malnutrition is one of the determinants of frailty and sarcopenia in elderly people.To investigate the role of amino acid supplementation in senior patients we performed an open-label randomized trial and administered a particular branched-chain amino acid enriched mixture (BCAAem) or provided diet advice in 155 elderly malnourished patients. They were followed for 2 months, assessing cognitive performance by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), muscle mass measured by anthropometry, strength measure by hand grip and performance measured by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the 30 s Chair Sit to Stand (30-s CST) test and the 4 m gait speed test. Moreover we measured oxidative stress in plasma and mitochondrial production of ATP and electron flux in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Both groups improved in nutritional status, general health and muscle mass, strength and performance; treatment with BCAAem supplementation was more effective than simple diet advice in increasing MMSE (1.2 increase versus 0.2, p = 0.0171), ATP production (0.43 increase versus -0.1, p = 0.0001), electron flux (0.50 increase versus 0.01, p < 0.0001) and in maintaining low oxidative stress. The amelioration of clinical parameters as MMSE, balance, four meter walking test were associated to increased mitochondrial function.Overall, our findings show that sustaining nutritional support might be clinically relevant in increasing physical performance in elderly malnourished patients and that the use of specific BCAAem might ameliorate also cognitive performance thanks to an amelioration of mitochondria bioenergetics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

These compounds have been widely screened for their pharmacological effects. Polyphenols, such as soy-derived isoflavones, also called phytoestrogens, have been extensively studied due to their ability to inhibit carcinogenesis. These compounds are chemically similar to 17β-estradiol, and mimic the binding of estrogens to its receptors, exerting estrogenic effects in target organs. Genistein is an isoflavone derived from soy-rich products and accounts for about 60% of total isoflavones found in soybeans. Genistein has been reported to exhibit several biological effects, such as anti-tumor activity (inhibition of cell proliferation, regulation of the cell cycle, induction of apoptosis), improvement of glucose metabolism, impairment of angiogenesis in both hormone-related and hormone-unrelated cancer cells, reduction of peri-menopausal and postmenopausal hot flashes, and modulation of antioxidant effects. Additionally, epidemiological and clinical studies have reported health benefits of genistein in many chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis, and aid in the amelioration of typical menopausal symptoms, such as anxiety and depression. Although the biological effects are promising, certain limitations, such as low bioavailability, biological estrogenic activity, and effects on target organs, have limited the clinical applications of genistein to some extent. Moreover, studies report that modification of its molecular structure may eliminate the biological estrogenic activity and its effects on target organs. In this review, we summarize the potential benefits of genistein on menopause symptoms and menopause-related diseases like cardiovascular, osteoporosis, , diabetes, anxiety, depression, and breast cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677709>Early markers of endocrinometabolic disease in newborns with delayed intrauterine growth.</a></h1><p>The adjustments to malnutrition in growth restricted fetus (GRF) that lead to , insulin resistance, diabetes and cardiovascular disease in adulthood are not well known. The most feasible explanation for this association is the hypothesis of catch up. Some studies postulate a greater influence of catch up growth than the low birth weight itself in developing metabolic and cardiovascular disease.This is a prospective cohort study of newborns with intrauterine growth restriction (defined as weight percentile at birth less than 10th) born during a one-year period. Clinical data of patients were recorded (gender, gestational age, data about breastfeeding and anthropometry during follow-up every 3 months). Some details of pregnancy and characteristics of the mother were also registered. Serum biochemical parameters (IGF-1, IGF-BP3, insulin, glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, DLD cholesterol, triglycerides, HOMA) were collected at birth from cord blood, 9 and 12 months. Two main comparative groups were established: those GRF who made a catch-up growth (increase in weight Z score higher than 0,67) during the follow-up and those who did not get it.126 GRF children were born in the study period. 125 accepted the inclusion in the study and 67 of them completed the full monitoring for a year; 47 of them made recovery growth and 20 did not. A significant difference between both groups was found in glucose in umbilical cord and triglycerides at 12 months: GRF children with catch up growth showed lower glucose levels (p = 0.03) and higher levels of triglycerides (p = 0.03). There were no statistically significant differences in the rest of laboratory parameters analyzed (IGF-1, IGF-BP3, insulin, glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, DLD cholesterol, HOMA at 9 and 12 months or triglycerides at 9 months).Those GRF with catch up growth during the first year of life have early changes in the triglycerides at the end of that period with higher levels than those GRF children without catch up growth. This finding could be useful to develop a tool for early detection of GRF children with higher metabolic risk in order to prevent future pathology.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

We hypothesized that MetS confers an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in severely injured trauma patients.We performed a retrospective review of trauma patients from 2014 through 2018, excluding patients <16 years of age, ISS <16, and with incomplete height and/or weight documentation. MetS was defined as the presence of diabetes, hypertension, and a BMI ≥30 kg/m. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS), complications, discharge location, and mortality.There were 4,491 patients meeting criteria of which 100 (2.2%) had MetS. Patients with MetS were older (64.0 vs 38.6 years, p<.0001) but similar in ISS (22 vs 22, p=.70). Hospital LOS was significantly longer with MetS (16.5 vs 11 days, p <.0001) as was ICU LOS (9 vs 5 days, p=.0002). MetS correlated with higher rates of AKI (19% vs 3.6%,p<.0001), ARDS (11.0% vs 4.6%, p=.01), cardiac arrest (10.0% vs 4.0%, p=.01), MI (2.0% vs 0.3%, p=.05), severe sepsis (8.0% vs 3.3%, p=.03), unplanned intubation (11.0% vs 5.0%, p=.02), unplanned ICU admission (13.0% vs 6.1%, p=.02), and non-home discharge (51.0% vs 30.2%, p=.0007). After controlling for age, GCS, ISS, gender, and mechanism, MetS remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.33-4.7, p=.004).MetS occurs infrequently in our severely injured trauma population but is strongly associated with increasing LOS as well as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, and renal complications. MetS also significantly and independently predicts death and should be identified early to facilitate prompt multidisciplinary treatment.Copyright © 2019.

Existing evidence on the sociocultural context remains unconsolidated. In this qualitative research synthesis, we aggregate research literature on contextual factors that potentially predispose adult women and adolescent girls to overweight and  to inform research, policies and programs over the life course.PubMed, CINAHL, PsychInfo, ProQuest Central, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched to locate qualitative research articles conducted in SSA countries beginning in the year 2000. After assessment for eligibility and critical appraisal, 17 studies were included in the synthesis. Textual data and quotes were synthesized using meta-aggregation methods proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute.The synthesized studies were conducted in South Africa, Ghana, Kenya and Botswana. The three overarching themes across these studies were body size and shape ideals, barriers to healthy eating, and barriers to physical activity, with cultural and social factors as cross-cutting influences within the major themes. Culturally, the supposedly ideal African woman was expected to be overweight or obese, and voluptuous, and this was associated with their identity. Although being overweight or obese was not acceptable to adolescent girls, they desired to be voluptuous. Healthy food choices among women and adolescent girls were hampered by several factors including affordability of nutritious foods and peer victimization. Both adult women and adolescent girls experienced ageism as a barrier to physical activity.This is the first qualitative research synthesis to amplify the voices of women and girls in SSA countries highlighting the challenges they face in maintaining a healthy body weight. Sociocultural, institutional and peer-related factors were powerful forces shaping body size preferences, food choices and participation in physical activity.

Reported here is our characterization of its therapeutic profiles in three mouse models with distinctive pathological features of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Our results firstly showed that AF alleviated high fat (HF) induced  and associated glucose intolerance, suggesting its therapeutic efficacy for MetS. In the type 2 diabetes (T2D) model induced by a combination of HF and low doses of streptozotocin, AF lowered hyperglycaemia and improved insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. In the non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-like model resulting from a HF and high cholesterol (HF-HC) diet, AF reversed the increased liver triglyceride and cholesterol, plasma aspartate aminotransferase, and liver TNFα mRNA levels. Consistent with its effect in promoting glucose disposal in HF-fed mice, AF stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane in L6 myotubes. However, these effects were unlikely to be associated with activation of insulin, AMPK, ER, or cellular stress signalling cascades. Further studies revealed that AF increased the whole-body energy expenditure and physical activity. Taken together, our findings indicate that AF exerts a therapeutic potential for MetS and related diseases possibly by promoting physical activity associated whole-body energy expenditure and glucose uptake in muscle. These effects are possibly mediated by a new mechanism distinct from other therapeutics derived from Chinese medicine.Copyright © 2019 Zhou, Fouda, Zeng, Li, Zhang, Xu and Ye.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682346> and Taxation - Is Australia Ready?</a></h1><p> is a growing epidemic spreading across the developed world, including Australia.

Many studies have demonstrated the role of MCH-R1 in feeding and energy homeostasis. It has been proven that oral administration of small molecule MCH-R1 antagonists significantly reduces food intake and causes a dose-dependent weight loss. In this study, two ligand-based pharmacophores were developed and validated based on recently published MCH-R1 antagonists with diverse structures. Successful pharmacophores had one hydrogen bond acceptor, one positive ionizable, one ring aromatic and two or three hydrophobic groups. These 3D-QSAR models were used for virtual screening of the ZINC chemical database resulting in the identification of nine compounds with more than 50% displacement of radiolabeled MCH at a 20 μM concentration. Moreover, four of these compounds showed antagonistic activities in Aequorin functional assay, including MH-3 which is the first MCH-R1 antagonist based on a diazaspiro[4.5]decane scaffold. The most active compounds were also docked into our previously published MCH-R1 homology model to gain insights into their binding determinants.

The latter favors a chronic low-grade inflammatory state and an over-activation of the innate immune system, which contribute to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Physical exercise is a powerful preventive tool and treatment for several diseases as it induces metabolic and immune effects that provide health benefits. Exercise is known to reduce inflammation; however, the underlying mechanisms responsible are not fully elucidated. One proposed mechanism is a reduced expression and/or activation of pro-inflammatory toll-like receptors (TLRs) on innate immune cells after exercise, which could contribute to the protective effect of exercise against insulin resistance and the prevention of the development of metabolic diseases. The aim of the present study is therefore to review the current evidence about the anti-inflammatory effects of exercise and toll-like receptors regulation on immune cells in humans. Key PointsObesity leads to a low-grade chronic inflammatory state and an over-activation of the innate immune system that is directly involved in the develop metabolic syndrome.The anti-inflammatory effect of exercise has been previously suggested through the reduction of the expression and/or activation of pro-inflammatory toll-like receptors (TLRs) in innate immune cells, which represent one of the main inflammatory responses triggered by obesityThe underlying mechanisms in which toll-like receptors expression modulate the reduction of chronic inflammation are not fully elucidated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672462>iNOS as a metabolic enzyme under stress conditions.</a></h1><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical acting as a cellular signaling molecule in many different biochemical processes. NO is synthesized from l-arginine through the action of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) family of enzymes, which includes three isoforms: endothelial NOS (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS). iNOS-derived NO has been associated with the pathogenesis and progression of several diseases, including liver diseases, insulin resistance,  and diseases of the cardiovascular system. However, transient NO production can modulate metabolism to survive and cope with stress conditions. Accumulating evidence strongly imply that iNOS-derived NO plays a central role in the regulation of several biochemical pathways and energy metabolism including glucose and lipid metabolism during inflammatory conditions.

Initially healthy weight adolescents (Study 1 N = 162; Study 2 N = 135) completed different fMRI paradigms and had their body mass measured annually over 3 years. Adolescents with the AA or AT genotypes showed less precuneus and superior parietal lobe response and greater cuneus and prefrontal cortex response to milkshake receipt and less putamen response to anticipated milkshake receipt than those with the TT genotype in separate analyses of each sample. Groups did not differ in response to palatable food images, and receipt and anticipated receipt of money, or in weight gain over 3-year follow-up.

The objective of the study was to verify the association between body mass index (BMI) and severity of CAD, its risk factors and surgical and percutaneous treatment in patients hospitalized in cardiological units.An ambispective, cross-sectional study was performed with patients older than 18 years attended by nutrition in the cardiology units, who underwent coronary angiography. The severity of CAD was categorized into two distinct classifications (CAD Class I and II), considering the presence of CAD as lesions ≥50% and ≥70%. The nutritional status of the patient was established based on BMI according to the World Health Organization (WHO) for the total sample and group of adults, and according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) for the elderly. Age, gender, presence of associated comorbidities, history of smoking, and performed procedures were collected in patients' records. For statistical analysis Kruskal Wallis and Chi-square tests were used, and Hodges-Lehmann estimate was used for the median. Comparisons and associations were considered significant when p < 0.05.A total of 703 patients were included, of which 495 had arterial lesions ≥70% and 513 patients' lesions ≥50%.

In patients diagnosed with CAD the increase in BMI was positively associated with the presence of DM (p < 0.001), DSLP (p < 0.001) and HTN (p < 0.001), and negatively with age (p = 0.007). Patients with  III, were diagnosed with CAD, in average, 11 years earlier than patients with normal BMI (p = 0.05). Therefore, the higher the BMI, the lower the age at the moment of the examination in the total sample, and in the group of elderly, and this association was not found in adults. There was no significant association of BMI with the severity of CAD, or with PCI and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The greater severity of CAD was positively associated with the presence of DM (p = 0.012 and p = 0.001), HTN (p = 0.033 and p = 0.003) and older age (p = 0.005 and p = 0.015).

This study aimed to assess whether the  susceptibility was associated with genetic variation in vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene by conducting a meta-analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were screened for all relevant articles published up to October 2018. The pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated using STATA 13.0 software for 4 polymorphisms in the VDR gene (ApaI, BsmI, FokI and TaqI). RESULTS Seven case-control studies, including 1188 obese patients and 1657 healthy controls, were recruited. The pooled findings showed that there were no associations between  risk and the VDR polymorphisms in ApaI, BsmI and TaqI loci overall.

Since high glucose levels are as toxic as lipids for hepatic metabolism, we hypothesize that altered response to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is associated to more severe NAFLD with significant/advanced liver damage.We studied 90 subjects with morbid  (73F/17M, BMI = 43.2 ± 5,9 kg/m) undergoing bariatric surgery and intraoperative liver biopsy, and measured HbA1c, HOMA-IR (fasting Glucose x Insulin/22.5), OGTT glucose and insulin profile, and calculated OGIS (muscle insulin sensitivity), hepatic-IR (glucose [AUC] x insulin [AUC]) during OGTT, insulin response as (insulin [dAUC]/glucose [dAUC] or Insulinogenic Index (IGI = (I-I)/(G-G)). Patients were divided in 3 groups according to liver biopsy: A (no-NAFLD, 23%), B (simple steatosis (SS), 53%) and C (NASH, 24%) with similar age, gender and BMI. Diabetes was 0% in no-NAFLD, 13% in SS, 35% in NASH. During OGTT, OGIS decreased from A to C (422 vs 360 vs 338, p < 0.01). Increased insulin concentrations, HbA1c, HOMA-IR and OGIS, not Hep-IR, were strongly associated to hepatic steatosis (p = 0.03, p = 0.0001 and p = 0.01 respectively). Hepatic fibrosis stage was mild as most of the patients had fibrosis grade-1 (69% vs. 8% no fibrosis) and associated to fasting insulin, HbA1c and HOMA-IR. dAUC-I/dAUC-G was similar in the 3 groups, while only AUC-I was strongly associated to steatosis (r = 0.35, p = 0.005), but not to fibrosis.In morbid  indexes of IR, and not of insulin response, are markers of histological severity of liver disease.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

All three components can be measured generically by the basic systolic and diastolic dimension measures of LV wall length, wall thickness and diameter. In this observational study we aimed to study the relations of normal generic strains to age, body size and gender, as well as the interrelations between the three strain components.Generic strains derived from dimension measures by longitudinal and cross-sectional M-mode in all three dimensions were measured in 1266 individuals without heart disease from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study.The mean ε was -16.3%, ε was -22.7% and ε was 56.5%. Normal values by age and gender are provided. There was a gradient of ε from the endocardial, via the midwall to the external level, lowest at the external. All strains decreased in absolute values by increasing body surface area (BSA) and age, relations were strongest for ε. Gender differences were mainly a function of BSA differences. The three strain components were strongly interrelated through myocardial incompressibility.Global systolic strain is the total deformation of the myocardium; the three strain components are the spatial coordinates of this deformation, irrespective of the technology used for measurement. Normal values are method-dependent and not normative across methods. Interrelation of strains indicates a high degree of myocardial incompressibility and that longitudinal strain carries most of the total information.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-c, and apolipoproteins A-I and B were measured on automated equipment using commercially available kits, in addition to the tests of antioxidant capacity of HDL and the enzymatic activity of Paraoxonase 1.After statistical analysis, it was found that BMI, WC, fat (%), triglycerides, ApoB/ApoA-I ratio and Vmax were higher in Brazilians, while HDL-c, ApoA-I, Lag Time, Vmax and PON1 activity were higher in Africans. In Brazilians, the ApoB/ApoA-I ratio was related to  factors and lipid profile, but in Africans it was related only to lipids. The antioxidant capacity of HDL and PON1 activity was better in Africans. Through independence testing, we observed an association with moderate risk of myocardial infarction with gender in Africans.

Two important hubs have emerged, the placenta/prenatal period and the postnatal gut, with alterations in mitochondria functioning crucial in both.Factors acting to regulate mitochondria functioning in ASD across development are reviewed in this article.Decreased vitamin A, and its retinoic acid metabolites, lead to a decrease in CD38 and associated changes that underpin a wide array of data on the biological underpinnings of ASD, including decreased oxytocin, with relevance both prenatally and in the gut. Decreased sirtuins, poly-ADP ribose polymerase-driven decreases in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), hyperserotonemia, decreased monoamine oxidase, alterations in 14-3-3 proteins, microRNA alterations, dysregulated aryl hydrocarbon receptor activity, suboptimal mitochondria functioning, and decreases in the melatonergic pathways are intimately linked to this. Many of the above processes may be modulating, or mediated by, alterations in mitochondria functioning. Other bodies of data associated with ASD may also be incorporated within these basic processes, including how ASD risk factors such as maternal  and preeclampsia as well as more general prenatal stressors modulate the likelihood of offspring ASD.Such an integrated model of the pathophysiology of ASD has important preventative and treatment implications.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677054>The association of the decline in glomerular filtration rate with aggressive endometrial cancers.</a></h1><p>Most site-specific cancer incidence is increased with the decrease of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We analyzed endometrial cancers depending on different type, staging, and histology grades. We hypothesized that patients with lower GFR levels have an increased risk for higher staging and histology grades of endometrial cancers.Patients were divided into two subgroups regarding GFR; the first group with GFR < 60 ml/min and the second group with GFR > 60 ml/min and regarding different histology grades and cancer stages. Cancers were also divided by stages (1-4). Patients were followed up during 1 year through regular controls in the outpatient clinic and during that time cancer recurrence was recorded.GFR was the strongest predictor for higher cancer histology grade and higher cancer staging. Patients with reduced GFR had OR for higher histology grade and higher staging of 1.06 and 1.06. Traditional risk factors for endometrial cancer development were not associated with higher histology grade or higher cancer staging.Higher staging and histology grades in patients with endometrial cancers are associated with reduced GFR. Patients with mild-to-moderate CKD had significantly higher number of cancers with higher histology grades and higher stages than patients with mild or normal GFR category.

However, to date, no studies have directly compared the effects of these two drugs on the components of the metabolic syndrome in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).The Comparison of Canagliflozin vs. Teneligliptin against Basic Metabolic Risks in Patients with T2DM (CANTABILE) study aims to examine whether the DPP-4 inhibitor (teneligliptin) or the SGLT2 inhibitor (canagliflozin) is the more effective drug for reducing metabolic risk factors as a composite in Japanese patients with T2DM.The CANTABILE study is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel-group comparison study. A total of 200 patients with T2DM treated with metformin alone or without glucose-lowering agents will be enrolled if they have one or more of the metabolic risk factors, such as , borderline high blood pressure, and dyslipidemia. They will then will be randomized into the Teneligliptin group or the Canagliflozin group and treated for 24 weeks.

Many techniques for operative repair have been proposed, most commonly performed as the Broström or modified Broström procedure. In patients with failed primary repair, hereditary collagen disorders, strenuous work activity, , or ligamentous laxity, the Broström repair is less likely to be successful, and anatomic or nonanatomic reconstruction should be considered. The purpose of this study was to compare the functional outcomes and patient satisfaction between anatomic and nonanatomic reconstruction of the lateral ankle ligament complex for lateral ankle instability using a retrospective cohort study. We evaluated 64 ankles in 62 patients who underwent either a split peroneus brevis tendon (n = 36) or semitendinosus allograft tendon reconstruction (n = 28) for lateral ankle instability performed by the same surgeon. Postoperative American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (p = .943) and patient satisfaction (p = .279) found no significant difference between either technique. Our results suggest that both split peroneus brevis and semitendinosus allograft may be viable alternatives for lateral ankle instability when primary ligamentous repair is not attainable.Copyright © 2019 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

Data were extracted from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1998-2001 to 2016-2017; n=25,893). Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was defined as a hepatic steatosis index >36 in the absence of any other evidence of CLD. The definition of alcoholrelated liver disease (ALD) was excessive alcohol consumption (≥210 g/week for men and ≥140 g/week for women) and an ALD/NAFLD index >0. The prevalence of NAFLD increased from 18.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.8-19.5%) in 1998-2001 to 21.5% (95% CI, 20.6-22.6%) in 2016-2017. During the same time period, increases were observed in the prevalence of  (27.0 vs. 35.1%), central  (29.4 vs. 36.0%), diabetes (7.5 vs. 10.6%), and excessive drinking (7.3 vs.10.5%).

The present study aims to assess the impact of a high fat diet on tuberculosis progression and microbiota composition in an experimental animal model using a C3HeB/FeJ mouse strain submitted to single or multiple consecutive aerosol infections. These models allowed us to study the protection induced by Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination as well as by the natural immunity induced by chemotherapy after a low dose  infection. Our results show that a high fat diet is able to trigger a pro-inflammatory response, which results in a faster progression toward active tuberculosis and an impaired protective effect of BCG vaccination, which is not the case for natural immunity. This may be related to dysbiosis and a reduction in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the gut microbiota caused by a decrease in the abundance of the Porphyromonadaceae family and, in particular, the  genus. It should also be noted that a high fat diet is also related to an increase in the genera , and , which have previously been related to dysbiotic processes.

In the experiment I, allopurinol and benzbromarone significantly reduced serum uric acid at 8 wk. Adipose RAS overactivation, adipose inflammatory responses and the development of  hypertension were all effectively prevented by hyperuricemia inhibition. In the experiment II, 6-wk treatment with allopurinol and benzbromarone significantly decreased serum uric acid, downregulated adipose RAS, abolished adipose inflammation and improved  hypertension.In conclusion, urate-lowering therapy protects rats against fructose-induced  hypertension. The mechanisms appear to be via downregulated adipose RAS and reduced inflammation in adipose tissue.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673982>Global Implementation of  Prevention Policies: a Review of Progress, Politics, and the Path Forward.</a></h1><p>This review describes policy and regulatory strategies to prevent  and summarizes worldwide progress and impediments to scaling up strategies globally.While there is considerable variation in the breadth and depth of uptake of recommended strategies, the adoption of effective  prevention policies has been slow and inconsistent. There is broad consensus that strong government, corporate, and consumer actions, including regulatory measures, are needed to advance  prevention policies. Governments have lacked sufficient will to take necessary action, the food industry has actively worked to thwart policies to protect its commercial interests, and consumers have not exerted sufficient influence or demand to produce change. Advancing  prevention will require the use of effective strategies to shape and influence the information environments and political environments towards messages and actions to support public health. Greater emphasis is needed on reducing the influence of commercial interests, mobilizing civil society, and targeting vulnerable populations through equity-focused frameworks.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671603>Glucagon Regulation of Energy Expenditure.</a></h1><p>Glucagon's ability to increase energy expenditure has been known for more than 60 years, yet the mechanisms underlining glucagon's thermogenic effect still remain largely elusive.

Increasing evidence, however, demonstrates that LDs fulfill a pleiotropy of additional functions. Among them is the modulation of protein as well as lipid homeostasis. Under unfavorable pro-oxidative conditions, proteins can form aggregates which may exceed the overall proteolytic capacity of the proteasome. After stress termination LDs can adjust and support the removal of these aggregates. Additionally, LDs interact with mitochondria, specifically take over certain proteins and thus prevent apoptosis. LDs, which are loaded with these harmful proteins, are subsequently eliminated via lipophagy. Recently it was demonstrated that this autophagic process is a modulator of longevity. LDs do not only eliminate potentially dangerous proteins, but they are also able to prevent lipotoxicity by storing specific lipids. In the present study we used the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae to compare the proteome as well as lipidome of mitochondria and LDs under different conditions: replicative aging, stress and apoptosis. In this context we found an accumulation of proteins at LDs, supporting the role of LDs in proteostasis. Additionally, the composition of main lipid classes such as phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylinositols, phosphatidylglycerols, triacylglycerols, ceramides, phosphatidic acids and ergosterol of LDs and mitochondria changed during stress conditions and aging.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677448>Effect of hormone replacement therapy on atherogenic lipid profile in postmenopausal women.</a></h1><p>Women develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) approximately 7-10 years later than men, but progress with similar risk after menopause. Recent studies suggest that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is cardioprotective when initiated early after menopause, but the mechanisms involved are still unclear.In the current study, we aimed to examine the effects of HRT treatment on the plasma atherogenicity in postmenopausal women. We studied the total lipid profile in blood samples collected in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial of women with a history of venous thrombosis (VT), the EVTET study.One-hundred and forty postmenopausal women <70 years were included in EVTET and randomized either to active treatment (one tablet of 2 mg estradiol and 1 mg norethisterone acetate daily) (n = 71) or placebo (n = 69). Blood samples were taken at baseline and after 3 months and subjected to routine assessment of hemostatic factors and lipids.Our study show that HRT compared to placebo significantly reduced plasma levels of Lp(a), ApoA1, ApoB, total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, LDL-C, TC/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio at 3 months. No effect was observed on ApoB/ApoA1 ratio or triglycerides. The change in Lp(a) was significantly and inversely correlated with the change in estradiol (r = -0.32; P = 0.001) and positively correlated to the change in lipids, tissue factor pathway inhibitor activity and antigen, protein C and fibrinogen (r between 0.26 and 0.45, p < 0.01).In sum, this study confirms a strong effect of HRT on atherogenic lipids with a large reduction in the pro-thrombotic Lp(a), suggesting an overall favorable effect on thrombogenicity after HRT replacement therapy in post-menopausal women at risk of VT.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

The aim of this study was to investigate whether a weight loss intervention before primary total knee replacement would improve quality of life, knee function, mobility, and body composition 1 year after surgery.Patients scheduled for total knee replacement due to osteoarthritis of the knee and  were randomized to a control group receiving standard care or to an intervention group receiving 8-week low-energy diet before total knee replacement. Patient-reported quality of life, 6-Min Walk Test, and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were assessed before intervention for the diet group, and within 1 week preoperatively for both groups, and the changes in outcome from baseline to 1 year after total knee replacement were compared between groups. The number of participants was lower than planned, which might introduce a type-2 error and underestimate the trend for a better outcome after weight loss.The analyses are based on a total of 76 patients, 38 in each group. This study showed major improvement in both study groups in quality of life and knee function, though no statistically significant differences between the groups were observed 1 year after total knee replacement. The average weight loss after 8-week preoperative intervention was 10.7 kg and consisted of a 6.7 kg reduction in fat mass. One year after total knee replacement, the participants in the diet group managed to maintain the weight reduction, whereas there was no change in the control group.The results suggest that it is feasible and safe to implement an intensive weight loss program shortly before total knee replacement.

Measurements used in the study were collected 6 times between kindergarten and fifth grade (Early Childhood Longitudinal Studies, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999) and 8 times between kindergarten through fourth grade (Early Childhood Longitudinal Studies, Kindergarten Class of 2010-2011).Among children with  at kindergarten entry, within 6 months, the risk of developing  was 73% and 76% lower for boys with late adiposity rebound than their classmates without late adiposity rebound (hazard ratio 0.27 and 0.24). Six months after entering kindergarten, similar association was observed for both boys and girls. Among children without  at kindergarten entry, within 12 months, the probability of reversing  was 52% and 54% higher for boys with late adiposity rebound than their peers without late adiposity rebound (hazard ratio 1.52 and 1.54). Twelve months after entering kindergarten, the probability of reversing  among both sexes with late adiposity rebound was 6-8 times that among children without late adiposity rebound.Late adiposity rebound was significantly associated with a decreased risk of developing  and an increased probability of reversing  among kindergarteners.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The current study sought to isolate changes in reward that may occur after the onset of diet-induced  by characterizing the economic demand for caloric (sucrose) and non-caloric (saccharin) reinforcers in a preclinical model of diet-induced  (DIO). We utilized economic demand analysis to measure baseline demand intensity (Q) and demand elasticity (α) for sucrose and saccharin reinforcers in rats. After baseline measures were collected, rats were assigned randomly to a high-fat (HF) diet or low-fat (LF) control diet. After 8-weeks of diet exposure, HF rats were divided into -resistant (OR) or -prone (OP) groups based on weight after the 8-week HF diet exposure. Post-DIO demand data for each reinforcer were reassessed. At baseline, rats had higher demand intensity and lower elasticity for sucrose compared to saccharin. After 8-weeks of the high-fat diet, OP rats had significantly greater weight gain and lower demand elasticity for sucrose and saccharin and higher demand intensity for saccharin. The changes in sucrose and saccharin elasticity suggest that DIO-induced changes in food-related behavior are associated with changes in reward processes. The changes in demand intensity for saccharin suggest that demand intensity, as a measure of 'set point', is not directly linked to metabolic processes. The current study shows that microeconomic theory and demand analysis is able to isolate independent aspects of diet-induced reward changes related to caloric and non-caloric reinforcers.Copyright © 2019.

The Swedish National Board of Health introduced the 2013 WHO criteria in 2015 as a recommendation for initiation of treatment for hyperglycaemia during pregnancy. With variation in GDM screening and diagnostic practice across the country, it was agreed that the shift to new guidelines should be in a scientific and structured way. The aim of the Changing Diagnostic Criteria for Gestational Diabetes (CDC4G) in Sweden ( www.cdc4g.se/en ) is to evaluate the clinical and health economic impacts of changing diagnostic criteria for GDM in Sweden and to create a prospective cohort to compare the many long-term outcomes in mother and baby under the old and new diagnostic approaches.This is a stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial, comparing pregnancy outcomes before and after the switch in GDM criteria across 11 centres in a randomised manner. The trial includes all pregnant women screened for GDM across the participating centres during January-December 2018, approximately two thirds of all pregnancies in Sweden in a year. Women with pre-existing diabetes will be excluded. Data will be collected through the national Swedish Pregnancy register and for follow up studies other health registers will be included.The stepped wedge RCT was chosen to be the best study design for evaluating the shift from old to new diagnostic criteria of GDM in Sweden. The national quality registers provide data on the whole pregnant population and gives a possibility for follow up studies of both mother and child. The health economic analysis from the study will give a solid evidence base for future changes in order to improve immediate pregnancy, as well as long term, outcomes for mother and child.CDC4G is listed on the ISRCTN registry with study ID ISRCTN41918550 (15/12/2017).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675936>Associations of tobacco smoking with body mass distribution; a population-based study of 65,875 men and women in midlife.</a></h1><p>Studies indicate an effect of smoking toward abdominal , but few assess hip and waist circumferences (HC and WC) independently.

Analysis of associations were adjusted for confounding by socioeconomic position, health indicators, and additionally for BMI.Compared with never-smokers, when adjusting for confounders and in addition for BMI, mean HC remained lower while mean WC and waist-hip-ratio (WHR) were higher in current smokers. The finding of a lower HC and higher WHR level among smokers was consistent by sex and in strata by levels of education and physical activity, while the finding of higher WC by smoking was less consistent. Among current smokers, BMI-adjusted mean HC decreased whereas WC and WHR increased by volume smoked. Compared with current smokers, former smokers had higher BMI-adjusted HC, lower WHR and among women WC was lower.The main finding in this study was the consistent negative associations of smoking with HC. In line with the hypothesis that lower percentage gluteofemoral fat is linked with higher cardiovascular risk, our results suggest that smoking impacts cardiovascular risk through mechanisms that reduce the capacity of fat storage in the lower body region.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680834>Gender and the Body Size Aftereffect: Implications for Neural Processing.</a></h1><p>Prolonged exposure to wide (thin) bodies causes a perceptual aftereffect such that subsequently viewed bodies appear thinner (wider) than they actually are. This phenomenon is known as visual adaptation. We used the adaptation paradigm to examine the gender selectivity of the neural mechanisms encoding body size and shape. Observers adjusted female and male test bodies to appear normal-sized both before and after adaptation to bodies digitally altered to appear heavier or lighter. In Experiment 1, observers adapted simultaneously to bodies of each gender distorted in opposite directions, e.g., thin females and wide males. The direction of resultant aftereffects was contingent on the gender of the test stimulus, such that in this example female test bodies appeared wider while male test bodies appeared thinner. This indicates at least some separation of the neural mechanisms processing body size and shape for the two genders. In Experiment 2, adaptation involved either wide females, thin females, wide males or thin males. Aftereffects were present in all conditions, but were stronger when test and adaptation genders were congruent, suggesting some overlap in the tuning of gender-selective neural mechanisms. Given that visual adaptation has been implicated in real-world examples of body size and shape misperception (e.g., in anorexia nervosa or ), these results may have implications for the development of body image therapies based on the adaptation model.Copyright © 2019 Brooks, Baldry, Mond, Stevenson, Mitchison and Stephen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672446>Predictive value of gastrointestinal hormones on weight loss.</a></h1><p>Bariatric surgery leads to profound and sustainable weight loss. Gastrointestinal hormones are involved in energy and glucose homeostasis, thus postoperative changes of their circulating levels may be mediating future weight loss. To investigate how the circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones change in response to the most common types of bariatric operation and whether these changes can predict future weight loss.We measured circulating GLP-1, GLP-2, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon, major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), ghrelin, GIP, PYY after overnight fasting and/or after a mixed meal test (MMT) in: a) 14 subjects that have undergone either an adjustable gastric banding [AGB] (n = 9) or a Roux-en-Y bypass (RYGB) (n = 5) (Pilot study 1), b) 28 subjects that have undergone either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 17) or a RYGB (n = 11) before and three, six and twelve months after surgery.In addition to the expected associations with GLP-1, the most robust increases were observed in postprandial levels of oxyntomodulin and glicentin three months after VSG or RYGB (but not after AGB) and are associated with degree of weight loss. Oxyntomodulin and glicentin levels at the third and sixth month postoperative visit are positively associated with feeling of satiety which may be underlying the observed associations with future weight loss.Beyond GLP-1, early postprandial changes in circulating oxyntomodulin and glicentin are predictors of weight loss after bariatric surgery, possibly through regulation of satiety. Further studies should focus on underlying mechanisms, and their potential as attractive therapeutic tools against  and related comorbidities.Copyright © 2019.

A total of 320 children aged 4-12 years participated in intervention program; 203 under Treatment 1 (PAHEPI program) and 117, only from Mestizo groups, under Treatment 2 (PAHEPI+ school meals). For Body Mass Index (BMI), cardiovascular and diabetes factors, pairwise comparisons of values at baseline and after treatments were done using Wilcoxon signed rank test. Generalized linear models were applied to assess the intervention effect by age, sex and nutritional status in relation to ethnicity and treatment.We observed improvements on BMI in children with overweight- and in triglycerides in the three ethnic groups. The Mestizo ethnic group showed the largest improvements under Treatment 2.

The diet quality was evaluated by score, which was obtained with a food frequency questionnaire.The diet quality comparison was made among the group with weight loss (GL; n = 22) and the group that maintained or gained weight during the nutritional treatment (GG; n = 22) showed that both groups had improvement in their diet quality scores from pre-treatment to post-treatment. Nevertheless, the GG had higher sugar consumption than the GL in the pre-treatment (p = 0.02) and in the post-treatment (p 0.01) periods. In the post-treatment, GL increased their scores for leafy vegetables (0.013), fruit (0.004), sweets (p 0.03), and soft drinks (p 0.02). GL improved their scores for fried food (p 0.01) and sweets (p 0.008).This indicates that in the weight loss treatment special attention should be given to the incentive to the fruit and leafy vegetables consumption and, to reduce the consumption of sweets.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

This insufficiency is mostly post-ischaemic in nature, but other aetiologies are possible in this high-risk population. In patients with DT2, diabetic cardiomyopathy is a recognized cause of cardiac insufficiency secondary to chronic hyperglycaemia and myocardial lipotoxicity, which promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (and, frequently, apoptosis of these cells), interstitial fibrosis and a decrease in myocardial contractile performance. Several studies have shown that diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with modifications to the intestinal microbiota, and changes in the synthesis of bacterial metabolites and their diffusion into the host, some of which appear to have direct deleterious effects on cardiac contractility. These findings open up new perspectives for pathophysiological studies by establishing the presence of a 'microbiota-myocardium' axis and raising the possibility of innovative new treatments. Correction of intestinal dysbiosis in patients with cardiac insufficiency could, therefore, constitute an innovative therapeutic approach to cases of this disease with a poor prognosis.Copyright © 2019.

Findings indicate sports sponsorship is widely used to promote unhealthy foods through professional and community sport, prompting increased awareness and preference for sponsor products. Most studies assessed self-reported responses to sponsorship, with a lack of behavioural data on food purchasing and consumption. Sports sponsorship by unhealthy food brands achieves vast population reach and exposure, promoting increased brand awareness and preference for sponsor products.

Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type 2 diabetes, in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and insulin-mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human , and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte metabolism. In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed 5-fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in , reduced levels after surgery-induced weight loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate measures of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte ipolysis and insulin signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.5-2-fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in  and insulin resistance, which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, relationship between the catecholamine level and plasma leptin in  has not yet been investigated. Moreover, whether pharmacological blockade of the adrenergic overdrive in  by the third-generation beta-blocker agents such as carvedilol could help to prevent metabolic disorders is controversial and remains to be determined. Using the high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model, we found that basal plasma norepinephrine, the principal catecholamine as an index of SNS activity, was persistently elevated and highly correlated with plasma leptin concentration during  development. Targeting the adrenergic overdrive from this chronic norepinephrine excess in HFD-induced  with carvedilol, a third-generation beta-blocker with vasodilating action, blunted the HFD-induced hepatic glucose over-production by suppressing the induction of gluconeogenic enzymes, and enhanced the muscular insulin signaling pathway. Furthermore, carvedilol treatment in HFD-induced obese mice decreased the enlargement of white adipose tissue and improved the glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity without affecting body weight and blood glucose levels. Our results suggested that catecholamine excess in  might directly link to the hyperleptinemic condition and the therapeutic targeting of chronic adrenergic overdrive in  with carvedilol might be helpful to attenuate -related metabolic disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682171>Urological Complications of  and Diabetes in Males and Females of Three Mouse Models: Temporal Manifestations.</a></h1><p>Diabetic bladder dysfunction is a frequent complication of diabetes.

Akita mice had insulin pellets implanted subcutaneously every 3 months to mimic poorly controlled type 1 diabetes in humans. Mice were hyperglycemic by 48 days following implants. Female mice exhibited no bladder dysfunction at any age up to 20 months and gained weight normally. In contrast, by seven months, male Akita developed a profound polyuria and failed to show normal weight gain. There were no observable signs of bladder dysfunction in either gender. DIO mice on high/low fat diets for 16 months, exhibited mild hyperglycemia in the females (not in males), mild weight gain and no evidence of bladder dysfunction.  mice were followed for eight months and became extremely obese. Males and females were glucose intolerant, insulin intolerant and hyperinsulinemic at four months. By eight months, their metabolic status had improved but was still abnormal. Urine volume increased in males, but not in females. Bladder dysfunction was observed in the spotting patterns of females at four and six months of age, resolving by eight months.

The incidence of hypertension is about 10.4% in well-nourished children, but when associated with  or overweight, this can rise to 38% and 68%, respectively. To assess the influence of physical activity on the blood pressure of children who are overweight or obese.This randomised clinical trial (RCT) was carried out in Granada (Spain), from October 2015 to June 2016. The sample consisted of 98 children, all of whom were overweight or obese. The intervention group (n=49) practised physical activity and received nutritional advice, while the control group (n=49) only received theoretical-practical sessions on nutrition. Body composition was measured, a nutritional assessment was made and blood pressure was determined (in percentiles, to avoid the misclassification of children who are located at the extremes of normal growth).Before the physical activity intervention, 85.7% of the children in the intervention group (with overweight/) were in the 95th or higher percentile for blood pressure, a situation representative of high blood pressure (hypertension). However, by the end of the study period, this value had decreased significantly (p=0.001), to 16.13%.Childhood  is a risk factor for hypertension. Physical activity, together with nutritional advice, effectively reduces blood pressure in children who are overweight or obese. The use of percentiles, according to age, weight and height, is an effective means of measuring blood pressure.© American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2019. All rights reserved.

After fasting, nearly half of the 264 subjects with FLI ≥ 60 (highest risk category) shifted to a lower category. The improvement of FLI correlated with the number of fasting days (r = -0.20,  < 0.0001) and with the magnitude of BMI reduction (r = 0.14,  = 0.0001). Periodic fasting with concomitant weight reduction leads to significant rapid improvement of FLI in subjects with and without T2DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679857>Green spaces, excess weight and  in Spain.</a></h1><p>The epidemiological evidence on green spaces and  is inconsistent.To study the association of access to green spaces and surrounding greenness with  in Spain.We enrolled 2354 individuals 20-85 years from urban areas of seven provinces of Spain between 2008-13.

We geocoded current residences and defined exposures in a buffer of 300 m around them: i) access to green space, identified using Urban Atlas, and ii) levels of surrounding greenness, measured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. We examined excess weight/ as binary outcomes based on body mass index and waist-hip ratio. We examined effect modification by genetic factors, sex and individual socio-economic status and mediation by physical activity and concentrations of PM and NO. To assess potential effect modification by genetic factors, we used a polygenic risk score based on  polymorphisms detected in genome-wide association studies. We used logistic mixed-effects models with a random effect for catchment area adjusted for potential confounders.Access to green space was associated with a reduced risk of excess weight/ after adjusting for confounders [excess weight: OR (95%CI) = 0.82 (0.63, 1.07), p-value = 0.143; abdominal : OR (95%CI) = 0.68 (0.45, 1.01), p-value = 0.057].

Once heart failure develops, the quality of life and longevity are dramatically affected. It is critical to prevent it. We evaluated the predictive ability of readily available clinical information to identify those likely to develop heart failure.We used a CART model to determine the top predictors for heart failure incidence using the NHANES Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS). The identified predictors were hypertension, diabetes, , and myocardial infarction (MI). We evaluated the relationship between these variables and incident heart failure by the product-limit method and Cox models. All analyses incorporated the complex sample design to provide population estimates.We analyzed data from 14,407 adults in the NHEFS. Participants with diabetes, MI, hypertension, or  had a higher incidence of heart failure than those without risk factors, with diabetes and MI being the most potent predictors. Individuals with multiple risk factors had a higher incidence of heart failure as well as a higher hazard ratio than those with just one risk factor. Combinations that included diabetes and MI had the highest incidence rates of heart failure per 1000 person years and the highest hazard ratios for incident heart failure.Having diabetes, MI, hypertension or  significantly increased the risk for incident heart failure, especially combinations including diabetes and MI. This suggests that individuals with these conditions, singly or in combination, should be prioritized in efforts to predict and prevent heart failure incidence.Copyright © 2019.

Quercetin occurs as a glycoside (with linked sugars) or as an aglycone (without linked sugars). Although quercetin has many different forms in nature, the form found in plants is quercetin-3-O-glucoside, which generally functions as a pigment that gives color to a multitude of fruits and vegetables. The recent literature has been reviewed using PubMed, Science Direct, and Embase databases. In this article, we reviewed quercetin with respect to chemical properties, absorption mechanism, metabolism, bioavailability, food sources, bioactivities, and possible health-promoting mechanisms. Quercetin is known as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, and anti- compound. It is thought to be beneficial against cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, neurological diseases, , allergy asthma, and atopic diseases. Further clinical studies with large sample sizes are needed to determine the appropriate dose and form of quercetin for preventing diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678208>Farnesol abrogates epithelial to mesenchymal transition process through regulating Akt/mTOR pathway.</a></h1><p>Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) refers to a phenomenon through which epithelial cells develop the metastatic and invasive potential, which are closely related to carcinogenesis. Farnesol (FOH) obtained from the oils of diverse plants can exhibit significant therapeutic actions against , diabetes, inflammatory conditions and cancers. Here, we evaluated the potential effects of FOH on growth and metastasis and it was observed that FOH significantly abrogated cell proliferation in lung cancer cells. Moreover, FOH inhibited cell repair movement by wound healing assay and reduced cell adhesion. It suppressed the expression of mesenchymal genes such as fibronectin, vimentin, N-cadherin, twist, and snail, and increased expression of epithelial genes such as occludin and E-cadherin. It also attenuated the migration and invasion through the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Furthermore, FOH inhibited the tumor growth of xenograft mouse lung cancer model, and modulated the expression of mesenchymal and epithelial markers. The results suggest that FOH may block the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and thus exhibit anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic activity against lung cancer cells.Copyright © 2019.

Our aim was to determine the effect of a palatable maternal diet on the transcriptional regulation of dopaminergic-related genes during perinatal development of the offspring. For that, female offspring from dams fed with a control (CON) or a cafeteria (CAF) diet were sacrificed on embryonic day 21 (E21) and postnatal day 10 (PND10). Using micropunch techniques, ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) were isolated from brain's offspring. Bioinformatic analysis of the promoter regions, mRNA quantification and methylation studies were done. The increase in tyroxine hidroxylase (TH), dopamine receptor (DRD) 1 and ghrelin receptor (GHSR) expression in VTA and NAc from E21 to PND10 was correlated with changes in DNA methylation of their promoter regions. Maternal diet did not affect the expressionpatternsin E21. At PND10, maternal CAF diet decreased the transcription of TH, GHSR, DRD2 and dopamine transporter (DAT) in VTA. Interestingly, the changes in TH, DRD2 and DAT expression were related to the methylation status of their promoters. In NAc, maternal CAF diet reduced DRD1, DRD2 and DAT expression in the offspring at PND10, although alternations in the methylation patterns were only detected in DAT promoter. These results show the importance of maternal nutrition and provide novel insights into the mechanisms through which maternal junk-food feeding can affect reward system during development and early postnatal life. Particularly important is the expression decline of DRD2 given its physiological implication in  and addiction.Copyright © 2019 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is unclear how the presentation of reduced sugar content on food packages affects taste expectations of consumers. Based on the learned knowledge about negative health effects of sugar and the common belief that unhealthy food tastes better than healthy food, consumers might conclude that lower sugar levels are associated with higher healthiness and lower tastiness. Addressing this concern, we examined how quantitative information about sugar content without any verbal description influences consumers' health and taste expectations of dairy desserts. We asked participants to indicate the expected healthiness and tastiness of randomly sampled dairy desserts, while varying systematically the quantitative sugar information provided in a label presented with the desserts (numerical sugar level in grams per 100 grams of product: low vs. original vs. high). We assumed that quantitative sugar content is not equally associated with healthiness and tastiness of products and that numerical information about sugar content informs health more than taste expectations. Therefore, we predicted that consumers expect higher healthiness, but not to the same degree lower tastiness for products with reduced sugar contented compared to products with higher sugar content. The results of the present study are in line with this hypothesis. We found that consumers expected desserts with less sugar to be healthier than desserts with higher levels of sugar. The experimentally varied sugar levels did not affect the tastiness expectations. Notably, consumers did not follow the unhealthy = tasty intuition and did not devaluate the tastiness of desserts because of heightened healthiness expectations. Our findings suggest that sole numerical information about sugar content-an important nutritional value-is more diagnostic in the construction of healthiness rather than tastiness expectations of food products.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678973>The Diagnosis and Treatment of Craniopharyngiomas.</a></h1><p>Craniopharyngiomas (CP) are rare embryonic malformations of the sellar/parasellar region with low histological grade. Clinical manifestations are related to hypothalamic/pituitary deficiencies, visual impairment, and increased intracranial pressure. Recent insight in molecular pathogenesis of CP opens new perspectives on targeted therapy in papillary CP harboring BRAF-V600E mutations. Further research to elucidate pathogenic mechanisms and hopefully prevent hypothalamic involvement of CP is warranted. If the tumor is favorably localized, therapy of choice is complete resection, with care taken to preserve optical and hypothalamic functions. In patients with unfavorable tumor localization (i.e., hypothalamic involvement), recommended therapy is limited hypothalamus-sparing surgical strategy followed by local irradiation. Surgical treatment strategies should be based on a multidisciplinary approach involving experienced teams. Centralizing treatment of CP in experienced "centres of excellence" and multicenter-based networks for reference assessments should be considered to assure high standards of treatment quality. CP recurrences and progressions are frequent. Irradiation has proven effective in reducing recurrences and progression. Proton beam therapy - available on a wider range in the near future - will help to avoid radiooncological side effects. Anatomical involvement and/or surgical lesions of posterior hypothalamic areas can result in serious quality of life compromising sequelae such as hypothalamic  and psychopathological symptoms. Novel insights into neuropsychological sequelae after CP should be the basis for the development of therapeutic neuropsychological interventions. CP should be managed as a frequently chronic disease, providing ongoing care of pediatric and adult patients' clinical and quality of life consequences by experienced multidisciplinary teams.© 2019 S.

The clinical presentation of hidradenitis suppurativa ranges from rare, mild inflammatory nodules to widespread abscesses, sinus tracts, and scarring. Quality of life is often affected, and patients should be screened for depression. Treatment includes wearing loose-fitting clothes, losing weight if overweight, and smoking cessation. Topical clindamycin alone can be effective for patients with mild disease. Patients with moderate disease can be treated with oral antibiotics, such as tetracyclines, in addition to topical clindamycin. Adalimumab, a tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor, is effective for patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa. Surgical procedures are often necessary for definitive treatment and include local procedures, such as punch debridement and unroofing/deroofing.

We used two rat models to ascertain potential changes in TG composition in milk associated to maternal intake of an obesogenic diet during lactation and to distinguish them from the effects attributable to maternal adiposity. Milk samples were obtained from dams fed a cafeteria diet during lactation (CAF) and from dams made obese by cafeteria diet feeding, with dietary normalization before gestation (PCaf). Levels of specific TG species in milk collected at different time points of lactation were determined by shotgun lipidomics. CAF and PCaf dams presented a greater adiposity than their respective controls. The principal component analysis of TG peaks showed a clear separation between milk from CAF dams and milk from control and Pcaf dams, already evident at 5 days of lactation. Milk from CAF dams was enriched with TG species with greater number of carbons and double bonds and reduced in TG with lower number of carbons. TG composition of milk from Pcaf dams was similar to controls, although specific differences were observed at day 5 of lactation. Thus, the intake of a cafeteria diet during lactation, rather than maternal adiposity, alters milk composition. This effect is avoided with dietary normalization before gestation, although the remaining fat reserves may also influence TG composition at initial stages of lactation. Therefore, normalization of maternal diet prior to pregnancy should be considered as a strategy for achieving optimal milk composition.Copyright © 2019.

This study aimed to examine the prevalence of aortic sclerosis or stenosis in 71-years-old men and determine which risk factors at 50 years of age predict the development of aortic sclerosis or aortic stenosis. . A random sample of Swedish men from the general population, born in 1943 ( = 798) were followed for 21 years. Data on clinical characteristics and laboratory values were collected in 1993. An echocardiography was performed in 2014. We used logistic regression to examine the association between baseline data and the outcome. . Echocardiography was performed in 535 men, and aortic sclerosis or aortic stenosis was diagnosed in 27 (5.0%). 14 persons developed aortic stenosis (2.6%). Among men with aortic sclerosis or aortic stenosis, 29.6% were obese.

Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the association between objectively measured PA and different clinical adiposity measures in a large sample of preschoolers.Four hundred sixty-three predominantly normal-weight (77%) 2-6-year-old preschool children participated in the Swiss Preschoolers' Health Study (SPLASHY). Physical activity was measured using accelerometers and was analyzed using 15-s (uni-axial) epoch length using validated cut-offs. Adiposity measures included body mass index (BMI), the sum of four skinfolds, and waist circumference (WC). Multilevel linear regression modeling, adjusted for age, sex and wear time, was used to assess the association between PA and SB with BMI, WC, and skinfold thickness.Total PA and different PA intensities were positively and SB was inversely associated with BMI in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (p < 0.05). Total PA was inversely associated with skinfold thickness in overweight and obese children (p < 0.05), while there was only a weak association for vigorous PA (p > 0.05). Moderate and moderate-to-vigorous PA were positively, and SB was negatively associated with WC in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (p < 0.05). Additional adjustment for potential sociocultural and biological confounding variables attenuated some of the results.In this very young and predominantly normal-weight population, PA is positively related to BMI and WC, but this relationship is not observed in overweight and obese children. In this latter population, PA is inversely, and SB is positively related to skinfold thickness. Skinfold thickness could represent a useful and simple clinical measure of body fat in preschoolers. The role of vigorous PA in the prevention of early childhood  should be further investigated in future studies.ISRCTN ISRCTN41045021 .

Recently, rather than general fat distribution, epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) gains a growing concern. EAT is the local adipose deposition between myocardium and pericardium. Accumulated evidence revealed several distinguishing characteristics of EAT. It lies contiguously with the myocardium and could infiltration into myocardium, actively secrets cytokines and adipokines mediating inflammation or remodeling, and contain abundant ganglionated plexi. Clinical research also found EAT may be an independent risk factor of AF. Volume or thickness of EAT measured on CT or MRI could be applied as a predictor of presence, severity, and recurrence of AF. Some drugs, like antidiabetic drugs, and Lipid-lowing drugs, show ability to reduce EAT. Additional surgical ablation of EAT was also proved could improve outcome of pulmonary vein isolation for AF.

Activation of brown-like transdifferentiation of white adipocytes (browning) has been proposed as a promising molecular target for  treatment. In this study, we investigated the effect of ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1), a saponin derived from  Meyer, on browning. We used 3T3-L1 murine adipocytes and leptin receptor mutated db/db mice. The lipid accumulation, AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKα)-related pathways, lipolytic and thermogenic factors were measured after Rb treatment in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Body weight change and lipolysis-thermogenesis factors were investigated in Rb1-treated db/db mice. Beta 3 adrenergic receptor activation (β3AR) changes were measured in Rb1-treated 3T3-L1 cells with or without β3AR inhibitor L748337 co-treatment. As a result, Rb1 treatment decreased lipid droplet size in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Rb1 also induced phosphorylations of AMPKα pathway and sirtuins. Moreover, lipases and thermogenic factors such as uncoupling protein 1 were increased by Rb1 treatment. Through these results, we could expect that the non-shivering thermogenesis program can be induced by Rb1. In db/db mice, 6-week injection of Rb1 resulted in decreased inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) weight associated with shrunken lipid droplets and increased lipolysis and thermogenesis. The thermogenic effect of Rb1 was possibly due to β3AR, as L748337 pre-treatment abolished the effect of Rb1. In conclusion, we suggest Rb1 as a potential lipolytic and thermogenic therapeutic agent which can be used for  treatment.Copyright © 2019 Lim, Park and Um.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679311>Anti-Inflammatory and Apoptotic Signaling Effect of Fucoxanthin on Benzo(A)Pyrene-Induced Lung Cancer in Mice.</a></h1><p>Fucoxanthin, a potent carotenoid present in various natural sources especially from seaweeds; it exhibits several biological effects like anti-neoplastic, anti-mutagenic, anti-diabetic, anti- and anti-inflammatory actions.

Oral administration of fucoxanthin with and without B(a)P were studied, the results from our study shows that fucoxanthin significantly decreased tumor progression in mice exposed to B(a)P, the obtained data were correlated with increased antioxidant, apoptosis and decreased tumour marker and anti-apoptotic molecules. With respect to apoptosis, fucoxanthin treated animals shows increased apoptosis compared to tumor induced mice by increased expression of caspase 9 and 3 and decreased expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl2 protein. Finally, histopathological and immuno histochemical analysis also revealed that fucoxanthin shows potent anticancer agent by bringing back the damaged tissue treated with B(a)P and also decreases the expression of PCNA in cancer induced mice. The anticancer effect of fucoxanthin may be attributed by several independent mechanisms which play a important roles in the prevention of cancer development, there is also substantial evidences to show that fucoxanthin acts indirectly by increasing the antioxidant capacity of affected tissue and prepared to cope up with oxidative stress which is proved in our study.

These factors, at the cellular level, are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and increased glucose uptake. Such events are poorly explored in the context of the salivary glands. In this study, we present a series of eight cases of a distinct salivary gland lesion characterized by multiple oncocytic cysts, and we provide new pathologic insights regarding its pathogenesis.Seven patients (87.5%) had a confirmed T2D, and  was identified in five (62.5%) patients. Clinically, the patients demonstrated bilateral parotid gland swelling with recurrent episodes of pain and enlargements. Imaging exams revealed multiple cystic lesions in both parotid glands. Microscopically, the parotid glands showed multiple cysts of different sizes, lined by oncocytic epithelial cells. Intraluminally, high-eosinophilic glass-like crystalloid materials were observed. Immunohistochemical studies were performed and the most notable finding was GLUT1 overexpression in the oncocytic cysts (not observed in any other oncocytic lesion of patients without T2D). In addition, higher expressions of mitochondrial antigen, fission 1 protein, and mitofusin-2 were observed in the oncocytic epithelium of the cysts. Furthermore, most of the oncocytic cysts demonstrated a pattern of cytokeratin expression consistent with striated ducts.Thus, these results strongly suggest that T2D is associated with alterations in GLUT1 expression in the cells of striated ducts with mitochondrial dysfunction, causing a hyperplastic process characterized by multiple oncocytic cysts. For this lesion, the designation of "diabetes associated-bilateral multiple oncocytic cysts of the parotid gland" is proposed.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682638>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is an early predictor of metabolic diseases in a metabolically healthy population.</a></h1><p>The relationship between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and incident metabolic syndrome in metabolically healthy subjects is unknown. We aimed to investigate whether nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a predictor of future metabolic syndrome in metabolically healthy subjects.Subjects who underwent health evaluation at least twice between 2009 and 2015 from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort in South Korea were included. Patients without  who had no metabolic syndrome components were finally analyzed (n = 28,880). The definition of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was based on both the hepatic steatosis and fatty liver indices. The incidence of metabolic syndrome, prediabetes/type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia was compared between the subjects with and without nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.The presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was associated with a higher risk of incident metabolic syndrome, prediabetes/type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia in the entire cohort (metabolic syndrome: adjusted hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-3.71; prediabetes/type 2 diabetes: adjusted hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.90; hypertension: adjusted hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-4.12; dyslipidemia: adjusted hazard ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-2.06).

To examine whether weight-related self-stigma and insomnia are potential mediators in the relationship between excess weight and health outcomes of distress and QoL.All participants (n = 934; 444 males; mean age = 15.7 ± 1.2 years; zBMI = 2.8 ± 1.0) completed questionnaires on weight-related self-stigma and insomnia at baseline. Six months later, they completed questionnaires on psychological distress and QoL to assess health outcomes. Relationships among variables were tested using mediation analyses with bootstrapping method.Weight-related self-stigma significantly mediated the effects of zBMI on psychological distress (effect = 0.22; bootstrapping SE = 0.09; 95% CI = 0.08, 0.45), psychosocial QoL (effect = - 0.64; bootstrapping SE = 0.19; 95% CI = - 1.10, - 0.32), and physical QoL (effect = - 1.35; bootstrapping SE = 0.54; 95% CI = - 2.43, - 0.26).

Whereas surgical outcomes have been extensively investigated, the impact of risk factors such as body mass index (BMI) and smoking on patient outcomes has not been explored. We hypothesized that  and smoking would have a negative impact on the functional and radiographic outcomes of surgically treated patients with distal radius fractures.We performed a retrospective analysis of patients surgically treated for a distal radius fracture between 2006 and 2017 at 2 level 1 trauma centers. Patients were divided into obese (BMI ≥ 30) and nonobese (BMI < 30) groups according to the World Health Organization BMI Classification. Patients were also divided into current, former, and never smokers based on reported cigarette use. Primary outcomes included patient-reported outcome measures (Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand [QuickDASH]), range of motion (ROM) arc (flexion-extension, pronation-supination), radiographic union (Radiographic Union Scoring System [RUSS] score), and change in radiographic alignment (radial height, radial inclination, volar tilt) between first and last follow-up. Multivariable models corrected for age, sex, comorbidities, fracture complexity, osteoporosis, and time to surgery.Two hundred patients were identified, 39 with BMI of 30 or greater and 161 with BMI less than 30. Obese patients had more comorbidities but similar fracture types. At 3-month and 1-year follow-up, both groups achieved acceptable QuickDASH scores, close to those of the general population (21 vs 18, 14 vs 2, respectively). The 2 groups were similar in regard to motion, RUSS score, and alignment. There were 148 never smokers, 32 former smokers, and 20 current smokers. At 3 months, smokers demonstrated higher QuickDASH scores (42 vs 21-24) and a lower percentage of radiographically healed fractures (40% vs 69%-82%). At final follow-up, smokers reported small differences in patient-reported outcomes (QuickDASH 18 vs 9-13) whereas ROM, fracture healing, and complication rates were similar.Both obese and nonobese patients can achieve excellent outcomes following surgical treatment of distal radius fracture with similar self-reported outcomes, motion, RUSS score, and alignment. Despite slower healing in the early postoperative period, smokers had similar QuickDASH scores, ROM, and union rates to past smokers and never smokers at final follow-up, with a similar complication profile.Prognostic IV.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Surgery of the Hand.

Multifaceted lifestyle interventions including diet and exercise are recommended as the first-line treatment for the metabolic syndrome.To investigate the effects of lifestyle interventions that include both diet interventions and supervised exercise on outcomes for people with metabolic syndrome.A systematic review and meta-regression was conducted. PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched from the earliest date possible until November 2018 to identify randomised controlled trials examining the effects of lifestyle interventions compared to usual care on patient health outcomes and components of metabolic syndrome. Post-intervention means and standard deviations were pooled using inverse variance methods and random-effects models to calculate mean differences (MD), standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Searching identified 2598 articles, of which 15 articles reporting data from 10 trials, with 1160 participants were included in this review. Compared to usual care, supervised lifestyle intervention demonstrated significant improvements in all but one of the components of metabolic syndrome. Reductions were seen in waist circumference (-4.9 cm, 95%CI -8.0 to -1.7), systolic blood pressure (-6.5 mmHg, 95%CI -10.7 to -2.3), diastolic blood pressure (-1.9 mmHg, 95%CI -3.6 to -0.2), triglycerides (SMD -0.46, 95%CI -0.88 to -0.04) and fasting glucose (SMD -0.68, 95%CI -1.20 to -0.15). Prevalence of metabolic syndrome was reduced by 39% in intervention group participants compared to control group participants (Risk Ratio 0.61, 95%CI 0.38 to 0.96). Improvements in quality of life were not statistically significant.There is low to moderate quality evidence that supervised multifaceted lifestyle intervention improves multiple risk factors of metabolic syndrome, as well as reducing prevalence of the disease.

We finally included 469 (97.30%) participants who had no missing data for data analysis. We collected individual data on socio-demographics, behavioral habits, and health information through standardized questionnaires. Satellite-based PM concentrations from 2013 to 2016 were assigned based on participants' residential addresses. The association between PM and FPG was examined using a generalized linear regression model while FPG was modeled as a continuous variable. An ordered logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between PM and FPG categories.Every 1 μg/m³ increase in PM was associated with a 0.34 mg/dL [95 confidence interval (95% CI): 0.08 mg/dL, 0.59 mg/dL] increase in FPG levels. Comparing with the low FPG level (under 86 mg/dL), every 1 μg/m³ increase in PM was associated with a 10.20% (95% CI: 1.60%, 19.80%) increase in the odds of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (100-125 mg/dL).

While  has been associated with poorer survival in breast cancer, the correlation with locoregional control is less well evaluated and was the subject of this evaluation.We utilised the New Zealand breast cancer registry to identify patients treated with breast conservation with BMI recorded. We retrieved patient demographic, tumour characteristic and treatment related information. We assessed local, and locoregional control outcomes as well as breast cancer and overall survival outcomes.2513 patients were identified. The median follow up was 5.25 years. 38% of patients were obese with a body mass index (BMI) of >30kg/m, 32% were overweight with a BMI of 25.0-29.9kg/m and 29% were either normal or underweight with a BMI of <24.9kg/m. Most patients were post-menopausal (65%). The median tumour size was 16.0mm (0.2mm - 80mm) and the majority were grade 2 or 3 tumours (45% and 33%).

This work evaluated an educational intervention with the primary aim of preventing overweight and  in pre-school children.A pragmatic, cluster randomised trial with a parallel, matched-pair design was undertaken. Interventions were targeted at both the cluster (Early Years' Centres, matched by geographical area) and individual participant level (families: mother and 2-year old child). At the cluster level, a staff training intervention used the educational resource Be Active, Eat Healthy. Policies and provision for healthy eating and physical activity were evaluated at baseline and 12-months. The intervention at participant level was the Healthy Heroes Activity Pack: delivered over 6 months by Centre staff to promote healthy eating and physical activity in a fun, interactive way. Child and parent height and weight were measured at four time-points over 2 years. The trial primary outcome was the change in BMI z-score of the child between ages 2 and 4 years. Secondary outcomes consisted of parent-reported measures administered at baseline and two-year follow-up.Five pairs of Early Years' Centres were recruited. Four pairs were analysed as one Centre withdrew (47 intervention families; 34 control families). At the cluster level, improvement in Centre policies and practices was similar for both groups (p = 0.830). At the participant level, the intervention group reduced their mean BMI z-score between age 2 and 4 years (p = 0.002; change difference 0.49; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.80) whereas the control group showed increasing BMI z-score throughout. Changes in parent-reported outcomes and parent BMI (p = 0.582) were similar in both groups.The Healthy Heroes educational resource deterred excess weight gain in pre-school children from poor socioeconomic areas.

Indeed, unusually slow psychomotor speed, a measure predictive of behavioural performance and health outcomes, is found with  and ageing, two conditions also associated with chronic inflammation. Yet whether inflammation is the mediating factor remains unclear. Here, we assessed inflammation by indexing interleukin-6 level in blood and measured psychomotor speed as well as indices of selective visual attention in young (mean = 26 years) or old (mean = 71 years) adults (N = 83) who were either lean or currently significantly overweight (mean body mass index = 22.4 and 33.8, respectively). Inflammation was positively and significantly correlated with psychomotor speed, age, and body mass index but not with attention measures. Using mediation analyses we show for the first time that inflammation fully accounts for the significant psychomotor slowing found in those with high BMI. Moreover, we further show that age-related psychomotor slowing is partially mediated by inflammation. These findings support the proposal that reducing inflammation may mitigate weight- and age-related cognitive decline and thereby improve performance on daily tasks and health outcomes more generally.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676442>Calorimetric approach for comparison of Angiopoietin-like protein 4 with other pancreatic lipase inhibitors.</a></h1><p>Pancreatic lipase (PNLIP) is a digestive enzyme that is a potential drug target for the treatment of . A better understanding of its regulation mechanisms would facilitate the development of new therapeutics. Recent studies indicate that intestinal lipolysis by PNLIP is reduced by Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4), whose N-terminal domain (nANGPTL4) is a known inactivator of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in blood circulation and adipocytes. To elucidate the mechanism of PNLIP inhibition by ANGPTL4, we developed a novel approach, using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The obtained results were compared with those of well-described inhibitors of PNLIP - ε-polylysine (EPL), (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and tetrahydrolipstatin. We demonstrate that ITC allows to investigate PNLIP inhibition mechanisms in complex substrate emulsions and that the ITC-based assay is highly sensitive - the lowest concentration for quantification of PNLIP is 1.5 pM. Combining ITC with surface plasmon resonance and fluorescence measurements, we present evidence that ANGPTL4 is a lipid-binding protein that influences PNLIP activity through interactions with components of substrate emulsions (bile salts, phospholipids and triglycerides), and this promotes the aggregation of triglyceride emulsions similarly to the PNLIP inhibitors EPL and EGCG. In the absence of substrate emulsion, unlike in the case of LPL, ANGPTL4 did not induce the inactivation of PNLIP. Our data also prove that due to various interactions with components of substrate systems, the effect of a PNLIP inhibitor depends on whether its effect is measured in a complex substrate emulsion or in a simple substrate system.Copyright © 2019.

This study addresses the question as to how bacterial species, characteristic of the human gut microbiota, collectively utilize mixtures of plant polysaccharides such as are found in dietary fiber. Five bacterial species with the capacity to degrade polymers and/or produce acidic fermentation products detectable in human feces were used in the experiments. The bacteria showed preferential use of certain polysaccharides over others for growth, and this influenced their fermentation output qualitatively. These kinds of studies are essential in developing concepts of how the gut microbial community shares habitat resources, directly and indirectly, when presented with mixtures of polysaccharides that are found in human diets.

Our results highlight the effectiveness and feasibility of dollar-matching programs for fruit and vegetable purchases by SNAP participants who shop at supermarkets, and they support the USDA's expansion of existing programs to that setting in additional states.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677159>Abdominal and Gluteofemoral Size and Risk of Liver Cancer: The Liver Cancer Pooling Project.</a></h1><p> is known to be associated with primary liver cancer (PLC), but the separate effects of excess abdominal and gluteofemoral size are unclear. Thus, we examined the association between waist and hip circumference with risk of PLC overall and by histologic type - hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). The Liver Cancer Pooling Project is a consortium of prospective cohort studies that includes data from 1,167,244 individuals (PLC n=2,208, HCC n=1,154, ICC n=335). Multivariable-adjusted hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using proportional hazards regression. Waist circumference, per 5 cm increase, was associated with an 11% increased PLC risk (HR=1.11, 95%CI: 1.09-1.14), including when adjusted for hip circumference (HR=1.12, 95%CI: 1.08-1.17) and also when restricted to individuals in a normal body mass index (BMI) range (18.5-<25 kg/m ; HR=1.14, 95%CI: 1.07-1.21). Hip circumference, per 5 cm increase, was associated with a 9% increased PLC risk (HR=1.09, 95%CI: 1.06-1.12), but no association remained after adjustment for waist circumference (HR=0.99, 95%CI: 0.94-1.03). HCC and ICC results were similar. These findings suggest that excess abdominal size is associated with an increased risk of liver cancer, even among individuals considered to have a normal BMI. However, excess gluteofemoral size alone confers no increased risk. Our findings extend prior analyses, which found an association between excess adiposity and risk of liver cancer, by disentangling the separate effects of excess abdominal and gluteofemoral size through utilization of both waist and hip circumference measurements.

Local examination revealed a cervix descended 2 cm below the hymenal ring, cystocele, urethrocele and a positive cough stress test. The pelvic prolapse was classified as POP-Q stage 3. Ultrasound exam revealed a uterus with diffuse adenomyosis of the posterior uterine wall and normal adnexa. Due to the patient's , the treatment plan was laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy for the treatment of adenomyosis, laparoscopic pectopexy for the correction of the apical defect and Burch colposuspension for the cure of stress incontinence.The patient was placed in the standard dorsal lithotomy position with the hips in extension and the knees flexed and the table in 45 Trendelenburg position. One umbilical 10 mm optical trocar and three 5 mm trocars were used, two inserted 2 cm above and medial to the anterior superior iliac crests and the third at 5 cm below the umbilical trocar. The dissection started on the left side of the pelvis. The peritoneum was incised in the center of a "V" shaped area bordered by the left round ligament and the obliterated umbilical artery (the medial umbilical ligament). The soft tissue was dissected and the left iliopectineal ligament (also known as the inguinal ligament of Cooper) was identified right under the external iliac vein and prepared. The same steps were repeated on the right side of the pelvis. The procedure continued with the dissection of the vesico-vaginal space. The anterior vaginal wall was exposed with the help of a retractor placed inside the vagina and held by an assistant. A supracervical hysterectomy was performed. An 8 by 15 cm polypropylene mesh, cut in T shape, was introduced in the abdomen. First, the short arm of the "T" was fixed on the anterior vaginal wall using multiple absorbable tacks (AbsorbaTack™ - ABSTACK30X Fixation Device, Medtronic, UK). In order to use a type of non-absorbable fixation, we decided to also fix the mesh to the cervix stump with three isolated stitches (Silk suture 2.0, Ethicon, USA). Second, with the purpose of ensuring a permanent fixation the lateral arms of the mesh were attached to the iliopectineal ligaments with multiple non-absorbable tacks on both sides (ProTack, Fixation Device, Medtronic, UK). The procedure continued with the complete closure of the peritoneum with vicryl 2.0. Because the patient also had stress urinary incontinence a Burch colposuspension was performed. In order to expose its limits, the urinary bladder was filled with 200 ml of saline. After the incision of the peritoneum the avascular space of Retzius was opened. The dissection continued until the Cooper's ligaments were exposed bilaterally. The proper suture placement points on the vaginal wall were facilitated by an assistant's intravaginal finger. Two isolated non-absorbable silk stitches (Silk suture 2.0, Ethicon, USA) were placed through the Cooper's ligament and through the anterior vaginal wall on each side. The knots were tied just enough to properly lift the vaginal wall in the normal position, assessed by the assistant by vaginal route, but not too tight to avoid urethral obstruction.The length of the surgery was 95 minutes with minimal blood loss of about 60 ml. The patient recovered well, with the Foley catheter being removed after 12 hours. The patient was discharged after 48 hours. The 6 months follow up examination revealed a correct anatomical position of the anterior vaginal wall and of the cervix, at 6 cm above the hymenal ring and no urinary incontinence.Laparoscopic pectopexy represents a new option for the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse. In the case we reported, no intraoperative or postoperative complications were present and the follow up assessment revealed an effective correction of the prolapse. Further studies are needed in order to conclude the efficiency and safety of this new procedure.Copyright © 2019.

RNA expression was determined by RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR. LncRNA knockdown utilised LNA-based GapmeRs. Cytokine production was measured by ELISA.Synovial fibroblasts (n=6 patients) from obese OA patients secreted greater IL6 (162 ± 21 pg/ml; p<0.001) and CXCL8 (262 ± 67 pg/ml; p<0.05) than fibroblasts from normal-weight OA (51 ± 4 pg/ml IL6; 78 ± 11 pg/ml CXCL8) or from non-OA patients (35 ± 3 pg/ml IL6; 56 ± 6 pg/ml CXCL8). Sequencing (n=4 patients) revealed obese OA fibroblasts to exhibit an inflammatory transcriptome, with increased expression of pro-inflammatory mRNAs, compared to normal-weight OA or non-OA fibroblasts. 19 lncRNAs were differentially expressed between normal-weight OA and non-OA fibroblasts and a further 19 lncRNAs differentially expressed between obese OA and normal-weight OA fibroblasts (>2-fold, p<0.05), which included MALAT1. MALAT1 was rapidly induced upon pro-inflammatory cytokine stimulation and upregulated in obese OA synovium, compared to normal-weight OA (1.6-fold, p<0.001) or non-OA synovium (6-fold, p<0.001). MALAT1 knockdown in OA synovial fibroblasts (n=4 patients) decreased CXCL8 expression and secretion (>1.5-fold, p<0.01), increased TRIM6 (>2-fold, p<0.01), IL7R (<2-fold, p<0.01), HIST1H1C (>1.5-fold, p<0.001) and MAML3 (>1.5-fold, p<0.001) expression, and inhibited synovial fibroblast proliferation.Synovial fibroblasts from obese OA patients exhibit an inflammatory phenotype.

Currently, there is no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral drug available against CHIKV infection. In this study, we examine the role, in the CHIKV viral cycle, of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1), two key lipogenic enzymes required for fatty acid production and early desaturation. We show that both enzymes and their upstream regulator PI3K are required for optimal CHIKV infection. We demonstrate that pharmacologic manipulation of FASN or SCD1 enzymatic activity by non-toxic concentrations of cerulenin or CAY10566 decreases CHIKV genome replication. Interestingly, a similar inhibitory effect was also obtained with Orlistat, an FDA-approved anti- drug that targets FASN activity. These drugs were also effective against Mayaro virus (MAYV), an under-studied arthritogenic Old world Alphavirus endemic in South American countries with potential risk of emergence, urbanization and dispersion to other regions. Altogether, our results identify FASN and SCD1 as conserved druggable cofactors of Alphavirus genome replication and support the broad-spectrum activity of drugs targeting the host fatty acids metabolism.Copyright © 2019.

Several studies have focused on the effect of different carbohydrates, mainly fiber, on gut microbiota. However, what remains to be elucidated is the impact of a key component of diet that is widely debated upon: dietary fats. This review highlights the importance of understanding the source, quality, and type of fats that could differentially modify the intestinal microbiome. Fats from plant-based sources such as nuts, or vegetable oils have shown positive alterations in gut microbiota biodiversity both in  and  studies. Nuts and other plant-based fat sources, dietary patterns (e.g., Mediterranean diet) rich in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats and, in some cases, polyphenols, and other phytochemicals, have been associated with increased bacterial diversity, as well beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria imparting a positive metabolic influence. It is with this interest, this narrative review brings together evidences on different plant-based fat sources, dietary patterns rich in vegetable fats, and associated changes in gut microbiota.Copyright © 2019 Muralidharan, Galiè, Hernández-Alonso, Bulló and Salas-Salvadó.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674727>Serotonin Prevents Differentiation of Brown Adipocytes by Interfering with Their Clock.</a></h1><p>Serotonin was shown to interfere with the differentiation of brown adipocytes. In addition, clock components inhibit brown adipogenesis through direct transcriptional control of key components of the transforming growth factor β pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serotonin abrogates brown adipogenesis by affecting clock functionality.Nondifferentiated and differentiated HIB1B brown adipocytes were treated with serotonin, and their clock expression and functionality and differentiation state were examined.Nondifferentiated HIB1B brown adipocytes treated with serotonin showed increased brown adipocyte markers alongside increased brain-muscle Arnt-like protein 1 (Bmal1) and RAR related orphan receptor A (Rora) but decreased nuclear receptor Rev-erbα mRNA levels. BMAL1 overexpression together with serotonin led to significantly lower brown adipocyte markers. Serotonin in the differentiation cocktail led to reduced brown adipocyte markers as well as clock gene expression. After differentiation, serotonin treatment significantly decreased brown adipocyte markers and reduced BMAL1 and RORα but increased REV-ERBα protein levels. Addition of serotonin to the differentiation medium or addition after differentiation reduced activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II subunit gamma, which interferes with circadian locomoter output cycles protein kaput (CLOCK):BMAL1 dimerization and transactivation.Clock expression is required at the early stages of differentiation to brown adipocytes, and serotonin interferes with this process by modulating clock functionality.

Hypovitaminosis D is mainly associated with environmental and lifestyle factors that affect sunlight exposure. However, genetic factors also influence 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) serum concentration. Although there is available information of genes with clear biological relevance or markers identified by Genome-Wide Association Studies, an overall view and screening tool to identify known genetic causes of altered serum levels of 25(OH)D is lacking. Moreover, there are no studies including the total genetic evidence associated with abnormal serum concentration of 25(OH)D. Therefore, we conducted a de-novo systematic literature review to propose a set of genes comprehensive of all genetic variants reported to be associated with deficiency of vitamin D. Abstracts retrieved from PubMed search were organized by gene and curated one-by-one using the PubTerm web tool. The genes identified were classified according to the type of genetic evidence associated with serum 25(OH)D levels and were also compared with the few commonly screened genes related to vitamin D status. This strategy allowed the identification of 35 genes associated with serum 25(OH)D concentrations, 27 (75%) of which are not commercially available and are not, therefore, analyzed in clinical practice for genetic counseling, nor are they sufficiently studied for research purposes. Functional analysis of the genes identified confirmed their role in vitamin D pathways and diseases. Thus, the list of genes is an important source to understand the genetic determinants of 25(OH)D levels. To further support our findings, we provide a map of the reported functional variants and SNPs not included in ClinVar, minor allelic frequencies, SNP effect sizes, associated diseases, and an integrated overview of the biological role of the genes. In conclusion, we identified a comprehensive candidate list of genes associated with serum 25(OH)D concentrations, most of which are not commercially available, but would prove of importance in clinical practice in screening for patients that should respond to supplementation because of alterations in absorption, patients that would have little benefit because alterations in the downstream metabolism of vitamin D, and to study non-responsiveness to supplementation with vitamin D.Copyright © 2019.

Although gender differences in MetS are well documented, little is known about sex-specific differences in the pathogenesis of COPD, especially when combined with MetS. Consequently, it is not clear whether the same treatment regime has comparable efficacy in men and women diagnosed with MetS and COPD. In the present study using sodium glutamate, lipopolysaccharide, and cigarette smoke extract, we simulated lipid metabolism disorders, , hyperglycemia, and pulmonary emphysema (comorbidity) in male and female C57BL/6 mice. We assessed the gender-specific impact of lipid metabolism disorders and pulmonary emphysema on angiogenic precursor cells (endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, cells of the lumen of the nascent vessel), as well as the biological effects of pegylated glucagon-like peptide 1 (pegGLP-1) in this experimental paradigm. Simulation of MetS/COPD comorbidity caused an accumulation of EPC (CD45CD31CD34), pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells in the lungs of female mice. In contrast, the number of cells involved in the angiogenesis decreased in the lungs of male animals. PegGLP-1 had a positive effect on lipids and area under the curve (AUC), , and prevented the development of pulmonary emphysema. The severity of these effects was stronger in males than in females. Furthermore, PegGLP-1 stimulated regeneration of pulmonary endothelium. At the same time, PegGLP-1 administration caused a mobilization of EPC (CD45CD31CD34) into the bloodstream in females and migration of precursors of angiogenesis and vascular smooth muscle cells to the lungs in male animals. Gender differences in stimulatory action of pegGLP-1 on CD31 endothelial lung cells in vitro were not observed. Based on these findings, we postulated that the cellular mechanism of in vivo regeneration of lung epithelium was at least partly gender-specific. Thus, we concluded that a pegGLP-1-based treatment regime for metabolic disorder and COPD should be further developed primarily for male patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680842>Glucagon-Like Peptide-1: A Focus on Neurodegenerative Diseases.</a></h1><p>Diabetes mellitus is one of the major risk factors for cognitive dysfunction. The pathogenesis of brain impairment caused by chronic hyperglycemia is complex and includes mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, neurotransmitters' alteration, and vascular disease, which lead to cognitive impairment, neurodegeneration, loss of synaptic plasticity, brain aging, and dementia. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a gut released hormone, is attracting attention as a possible link between metabolic and brain impairment. Several studies have shown the influence of GPL-1 on neuronal functions such as thermogenesis, blood pressure control, neurogenesis, neurodegeneration, retinal repair, and energy homeostasis. Moreover, modulation of GLP-1 activity can influence amyloid β peptide aggregation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dopamine (DA) levels in Parkinson's disease (PD). GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) showed beneficial actions on brain ischemia in animal models, such as the reduction of cerebral infarct area and the improvement of neurological deficit, acting mainly through inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. They might also exert a beneficial effect on the cognitive impairment induced by diabetes or  improving learning and memory by modulating synaptic plasticity. Moreover, GLP-1RAs reduced hippocampal neurodegeneration. Besides this, there are growing evidences on neuroprotective effects of these agonists in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, regardless of diabetes. In PD animal models, GPL-1RAs were able to protect motor activity and dopaminergic neurons whereas in AD models, they seemed to improve nearly all neuropathological features and cognitive functions. Although further clinical studies of GPL-1RAs in humans are needed, they seem to be a promising therapy for diabetes-associated cognitive decline.Copyright © 2019 Grieco, Giorgi, Gentile, d’Erme, Morano, Maras and Filardi.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674848>Clémentine Delait (1865-1934), the most famous bearded lady on the continent in the 20th century.</a></h1><p>Clémentine Delait Clattaux (1865-1934), the Bearded Woman from Thaon-les-Vosges, France, did not suffer from her extreme hirsutism, but used it to her advantage.

The aim of this study was to explore the molecular mechanisms of its role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).NAFLD mouse models were established by using eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) or (and) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 18 weeks. From the beginning of HFD, HFD-induced mice were subjected to amlexanox or vehicle for 18 weeks. HFD+LPS-induced mice were treated with amlexanox or vehicle for the last 6 weeks. Blood biochemistry parameters were determined using automatic biochemistry analyzer. Histological changes of liver tissue were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and Oil Red O staining. The expressions of IKKε and smooth muscle actin-α (α-SMA) were evaluated through immunohistochemistry. Serum inflammatory mediator was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Gene expressions involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin signaling pathway were examined using quantitative RT-PCR or Western blotting.This study demonstrated that amlexanox reversed glucose and lipid metabolic disturbance and hepatic steatosis in NAFLD mice model. IKKε was specific expressed in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) instead of hepatocytes. This study also found that amlexanox improved insulin signaling (Insulin-IRS-1-Akt) in hepatocytes through inhibiting inflammation (IKKε-NF-κB-TNF-α/IL-1α) in HSCs.The present study confirmed that IKKε was specific expressed in HSCs. Inhibition of activated HSCs was responsible for effects of amlexanox on NAFLD, with improving insulin signal pathway in hepatocytes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Echocardiographers at each site were blinded to the treatment allocation. Statistical analysis was performed using a linear mixed-effects model with a treatment group/repeated measures interaction to determine the differential effect between CPAP and NIV.196 patients were analysed, 102 treated with CPAP and 94 treated with NIV. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure decreased from 40.5±1.47 mmHg at baseline to 35.3±1.33 mmHg at 3 years with CPAP and from 41.5±1.56 mmHg to 35.5±1.42 with NIV (p<0.0001 for longitudinal intragroup changes for both treatment arms). However, there were no significant differences between groups. NIV and CPAP therapies similarly improved left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and reduced left atrial diameter. Both treatments led to a significant improvement in respiratory function and dyspnea.In patients with OHS who have concomitant severe obstructive sleep apnea, long-term treatment with NIV and CPAP led to similar degrees of improvement in pulmonary hypertension and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.

The aim of this current review was to identify and summarise the evidence for effectiveness of PA interventions on PA levels for pregnant women with overweight and , with an emphasis on the BCTs employed.A systematic review and meta-analysis of PA intervention studies using the PRISMA statement was conducted. Searches were conducted of eight databases in January 2019. Strict inclusion/exclusion criteria were employed. The validity of each included study was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. The primary outcome measure was change in PA levels, subjectively or objectively measured, with physical fitness as a secondary outcome. All intervention descriptions were double coded by two authors using Michie's et al's BCT taxonomy V1. Meta-analyses using random effect models assessed the intervention effects on PA. Other PA outcomes were summarised in a narrative synthesis.From 8389 studies, 19 met the inclusion criteria 13 of which were suitable for inclusion in a meta-analysis. The remaining 6 studies were described narratively due to insufficient data and different outcome measures reported. In the meta-analysis, comparing interventions to a control group, significant increases were found in the intervention group for metabolic equivalent (SMD 0.39 [0.14, 0.64], Z = 3.08 P = 0.002) and physical fitness (VO max) (SMD 0.55 [0.34, 0.75], Z = 5.20 P = < 0.001). Of the other six, five studies reported an increase in PA for the intervention group versus the control with the other study reporting a significant decrease for women in their 3rd trimester (p = 0.002). 'Self-monitoring of behaviour' was the most frequently used BCTs (76.5%), with 'social support' being newly identified for this pregnant population with overweight or .This review identified a slight increase in PA for pregnant women with overweight and  participating in interventions. However, due to the high risk of bias of the included studies, the results should be interpreted with caution. PA measures should be carefully selected so that studies can be meaningfully compared and standardised taxonomies should be used so that BCTs can be accurately assessed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673458>Prescribing Patterns of Continuous Infusions in Nonobese versus Obese Children Admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.</a></h1><p>This retrospective study compared the continuous infusions prescribed for obese and nonobese children.

Within the last 37 years, we have found only 27 cases reported in the literature of intestinal obstruction caused by a migrated intragastric balloon. We report the laparoscopic management of such a case and make observations from similar case presentations published in the literature. A 26-year-old woman had an intragastric balloon placed endoscopically for weight control 13 months previously. She presented to the emergency department with a four-day history of intermittent abdominal cramps and vomiting. Contrast enhanced computed tomography confirmed the presence of the intragastric balloon within the small bowel. At laparoscopic retrieval, the deflated intragastric balloon was found impacted in the terminal ileum approximately 15 cm from the ileocaecal valve. The balloon was retrieved by enterotomy and primary closure of the ileum without event. The risk of balloon deflation and subsequent migration increases over time but several published cases demonstrate that this complication can occur within six months of insertion. The initial approach to the treatment of migrated intragastric balloons causing small bowel obstruction should be determined by the location of impaction, severity of obstruction and the available skill set of the attending radiologist, endoscopist and/or surgeon. Balloons causing obstruction in the duodenum are likely amenable to endoscopic retrieval whereas impaction within the jejunum or ileum could be managed by percutaneous needle aspiration (in selected cases), endoscopy (double-balloon enteroscopy), laparoscopy or open surgery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673470>Predictors of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes in a refugee population from an active conflict country, Syria.</a></h1><p>To elucidate predictors of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes in refugees emigrating from an active conflict region (Syria).This study included Syrian pregnant women who gave birth in Etlik Zübeyde Hanım Training and Research Hospital between 2013 and 2016. Adverse perinatal outcomes were defined as preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, early membrane rupture, intrauterine growth retardation, hypertension, perinatal excites, and erythrocyte-transfused cases.

The objective of this study is to review available studies on the prevalence of overweight,  and underweight in Iranian pediatric population.Articles published in the international and national journals were collected via the electronic research engines including MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus, Scientific Information Database (SID), and Magiran about the prevalence of childhood overweight,  and underweight in all regions of Iran. Only population-based studies were included.Large variations were documented in the prevalence of weight disorders in children of different age and sex groups living in various regions of Iran. Our findings revealed increasing trend of childhood  and overweight, but this change was not very sharp. In addition, underweight is still one of the main nutritional problems in children of some areas including Sistan-vaBaluchistan and Kerman provinces.Similar to many other developing countries, double burden of nutritional disorders exists in children living in some parts of Iran. While till now most health policies and educational programs related to children's nutrition in Iran had focused on underweight and malnutrition, more attention should be paid to the problem of excess weight.© 2019 The Author(s).

To determine SLN protein expression in human skeletal muscle and its relationship with adiposity, resting energy expenditure (REE), and performance, SLN was assessed by Western blot in 199 biopsies from two previous studies. In one study, 15 overweight volunteers underwent a pre-test followed by four days of caloric restriction and exercise (45min one-arm cranking + 8h walking), and three days on a control diet. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the trained and non-exercised deltoid, and vastus lateralis (VL). In another study, 16 men performed seven sessions of 4-6x30-sec all-out sprints on the cycle ergometer with both limbs, and their VL and triceps brachii biopsied pre- and post-training. SLN expression was two-fold and 44% higher in the VL than in the deltoids and triceps brachii, respectively. SLN was associated neither with adiposity nor REE, and was not altered by a severe energy deficit (5,500 kcal/d). SLN and cortisol changes after the energy deficit were correlated (r=0.38, P=0.039). SLN was not altered by low-intensity exercise in the overweight subjects, whereas it was reduced after sprint training in the other group. The changes in SLN with sprint training were inversely associated with the changes in gross efficiency (r=-0.59, P=0.016). No association was observed between aerobic or anaerobic performance and SLN expression. In conclusion, sarcolipin appears to play no role in regulating the fat mass of men. Sprint training reduces sarcolipin expression, which may improve muscle efficiency.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Eligible patients of Pacific Island ethnicity (Pacific patients) in New Zealand (NZ) follow this wider trend.The present study explored structural barriers contributing to Pacific patients' disproportionately high preoperative attrition rates from publicly-funded bariatric surgery in Auckland, NZ.Publicly-funded bariatric surgery programmes based in the wider Auckland area, NZ.Semi-structured interviews with health sector professionals (n=21) were conducted.Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach.Two primary themes were identified: (1)  which included  and  and (2)  which included  and . Clinical environments and an under-representation of Pacific staff were considered to be barriers to developing emotional safety, trust and acceptance of the surgery process with patients and their families. Additionally, economic deprivation and lower health literacy impacted preoperative goals.Health professionals' accounts indicated that Pacific patients face substantial levels of disconnection in bariatric surgery programmes. Increasing representation of Pacific ethnicity by employing more Pacific health professionals in bariatric teams and finding novel solutions to implement preoperative programme components have the potential to reduce this disconnect. Addressing cultural competency of staff, increasing consultancy times and working in community settings may enable staff to better support Pacific patients and their families. Programme structures could be more accommodating to practical barriers of attending appointments, managing patients' preoperative health goals and improving patients' health literacy. Given that Pacific populations, and other patients from minority ethnic backgrounds living globally, also face high rates of  and barriers accessing bariatric surgery, our findings are likely to have broader applicability.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The cell types and the precursor cells of PVAT appear to be different according to their location, with the component cell type including white, brown, and beige adipocytes. PVAT releases a panel of adipokines and cytokines that maintain vascular homeostasis, but it also has the ability of intervention in the pathogenesis of the atherosclerotic plaques development and in the vascular tone modulation. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge and discuss the role of PVAT as a major contributing factor in the pathogenesis of ischemic coronary disease, hypertension, , and diabetes mellitus. The new perspective of PVAT as an endocrine organ, along with the recent knowledge of the mechanisms involved in dysfunctional PVAT intervention in local vascular homeostasis perturbations, nowadays represent a new area of research in cardiovascular pathology, aiming to discover new therapeutic methods.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676444>Lithium chloride promotes lipid accumulation through increased reactive oxygen species generation.</a></h1><p>LiCl is widely prescribed for bipolar disorder but adversely associated with a higher incidence of increased body weight. Here, we investigated effects and underlying mechanisms of LiCl on lipid accumulation. LiCl induced dose-dependent lipid accumulation in HepG2 and RAW264.7 cells under normal as well as high glucose conditions. LiCl exposure additionally promoted lipid accumulation in livers of zebrafish. SB216763, a specific GSK-3β inhibitor, did not affect lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Expression of key lipogenic enzymes, such as FAS and aP2, as well as SR-B1 were increased in RAW264.7 cells. LiCl enhanced FAS, ACC and SCD-1 mRNA levels while suppressing CPT-1 in HepG2 cells. LiCl stimulated DNA binding activities of SREBP-1c and ChREBP. LiCl activated AMPK phosphorylation but the AMPK inhibitor, AICAR, did not suppress LiCl-induced lipid accumulation in RAW264.7. LiCl, but not SB216763, induced a significant increase in ROS in RAW264.7 and HepG2 cells. NOX activity was dose-dependently enhanced by LiCl. Furthermore, NOX-1, NOX-2 and DUOX-1 mRNA levels were upregulated at an early stage of LiCl stimulation. LiCl-induced lipid accumulation was suppressed by the antioxidant, NAC, and inhibitors of NOX, DPI and APO. Phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of CREB were enhanced by LiCl. The cell-permeable cAMP analog, di-butyryl cAMP, not only promoted lipid accumulation itself but also LiCl-induced lipid accumulation in RAW264.7 cells. H-89, a PKA inhibitor, suppressed CREB activation, lipid accumulation and NOX activity in RAW264.7 cells. Our results indicate that LiCl stimulates lipid accumulation in hepatocyte and macrophage cells potentially through increased PKA-dependent ROS production.Copyright © 2019.

BMI z scores were calculated, student  or /overweight was determined using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts, and these data were combined with the locations of four food outlet types (fast-food restaurants, wait-service restaurants, corner stores, and supermarkets) to calculate distance to the nearest outlet. Associations between weight status outcomes and distance to these food outlet types were examined using neighborhood (census tract) fixed effects.Living farther than 0.025 mile (about half of a city block) from the nearest fast-food restaurant was associated with lower  and /overweight risk and lower BMI z scores. Results ranged from 2.5% to 4.4% decreased . Beyond this distance, there were generally no impacts of the food environment and little to no impact of other food outlet types.Proximity to fast-food restaurants was inversely related to childhood , but no relationships beyond that were seen.

We propose a network model of fatigue encompassing multiple and mutually interacting biological, psychological and social factors. Guided by this model, we reviewed the literature to offer a comprehensive overview of factors that have been associated with fatigue in RA. Six categories of variables were found: physical functioning, psychological functioning, medical status, comorbidities and symptoms, biographical variables and miscellaneous variables. We then systematically reviewed associations between fatigue and factors commonly addressed by rheumatology health professionals. Correlations of fatigue with physical disability, poor mental well-being, pain, sleep disturbance and depression and anxiety were ∼0.50. Mostly these correlations remained significant in multivariate analyses, suggesting partly independent influences on fatigue and differences between individuals. These findings indicate the importance of research into individual-specific networks of biopsychosocial factors that maintain fatigue and tailored interventions that target the influencing factors most relevant to that person.© The Author(s) 2019.

One-way analysis of variance modeled time effects on GM/WM volumes, and then alterations in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) were assessed.Significant time effects on GM volumes were in caudate (F = 11.20), insula (INS; F = 10.11), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC; F = 13.32), and inferior frontal gyrus (F = 12.18), and on WM volumes in anterior cingulate cortex (F = 15.70), PCC (F = 15.56), and parahippocampus (F = 17.96, P < .05). Post hoc tests showed significantly increased GM volumes in caudate (mean change ± SEM .018 ± .005 and P = .001, .031 ± .007 and P < .001), INS (.027 ± .008 and P = .003, .043 ± .009 and P < .001), and PCC (.008 ± .004 and P = .042, .026 ± .006 and P < .001), and increased WM volumes in anterior cingulate cortex (.029 ± .006 and P < .001, .041 ± .008 and P < .001), PCC (.017 ± .004 and P < .001, .032 ± .006 and P < .001), and parahippocampus (.031 ± .008 and P =.001, .075 ± .013 and P < .001) at 1 and 3 months postLSG compared with preLSG.

GM volumes in INS and PCC showed a positive correlation at 1 (r = .57, P = .001) and 3 months postLSG (r = .55, P = .001). GM volume in INS and PCC were positively correlated with RSFC of INS-PCC (r = .40 and P = .03, r = .55 and P = .001) and PCC-INS (r = .37 and P = .046, r = .57 and P < .001) at 1 month postLSG. GM volume in INS was also positively correlated with RSFC of INS-PCC (r = .44, P = .014) and PCC-INS (r = .38, P = .037) at 3 months postLSG.LSG induces sustained structural brain changes, which might mediate long-term benefits of bariatric surgery in weight reduction. Associations between regional GM volume and RSFC suggest that LSG-induced structural changes contribute to RSFC changes.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Bariatric Surgery.

This community-based study aimed to assess this association among Iranian women.We recruited 5,344 eligible women out of 7718, aged 10-50 years who participated in the Tehran lipid and glucose study (TLGS), conducted in 1999-2000. Based on their age at menarche, these women were subdivided into five groups: <11 years, 11-12 years, 13-14 years, 15-16 years and ≥17 years. The status of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components were compared among study subgroups.The crude prevalence of MetS was 11.9, 95% CI: 11.0-13.0. Prevalence values for MetS components were 20.1 for central  (95% CI: 19.0-21.3), 15.7 for high fasting blood sugar (FBS), (95% CI: 14.5-17.1), 15.1 for high triglycerides, (95% CI: 14.1-16.3), 53.5 for low high density lipoproteins (HDL) (95% CI: 51.9-55.0) and 9.5 for high blood pressure (BP) (95% CI: 8.5-10.4). After adjustment for covariates, menarche age <11 years, compared to 13-14 years, was significantly associated with higher risk of Mets (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1-5.4) and its components; i.e. central  (OR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.5-4.2), BP (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.4-6.0) and FBS (OR = 3.0, 95% CI: 1.4-6.0). To compare our results with other studies, we calculated the standardized prevalence of MetS which was based on the WHO standardized population 11.5, 95%CI: 10.7-12.5 and the standardized prevalence of MetS by the population in Tehran was 11.7, 95% CI: 10.7-12.6.Early menarche can be associated with an increase in metabolic disturbances later in life.© 2019 The Author(s).

However, it remains unclear whether and how suppression of PVAT remodeling could attenuate vascular injury. In this study, we examined the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, luseogliflozin on PVAT remodeling and neointima formation after wire injury in mice.Wilt-type mice fed with low-fat diet (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD) received oral administration of luseogliflozin (18 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Mice underwent bilateral femoral artery wire injury followed by unilateral removal of surrounding PVAT. After 25 days, injured femoral arteries and surrounding PVAT were analyzed.In LFD-fed lean mice, neither luseogliflozin treatment or PVAT removal attenuated the intima-to-media (I/M) ratio of injured arteries. However, in HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin or PVAT removal reduced the I/M ratio, whereas their combination showed no additive reduction. In PVAT surrounding injured femoral arteries of HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin treatment decreased the adipocyte sizes. Furthermore, luseogliflozin reduced accumulation of macrophages expressing platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and increased adiponectin gene expression. Gene expression levels of Pdgf-b in PVAT were correlated with the I/M ratio.Our present study suggests that luseogliflozin could attenuate neointimal hyperplasia after wire injury in HFD-fed mice partly via suppression of macrophage PDGF-B expression in PVAT.

The aim of this study was to study the global variations in perioperative practices concerning SG.A 37-item questionnaire-based survey was conducted to capture the perioperative practices of the global community of bariatric surgeons. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.Response of 863 bariatric surgeons from 67 countries with a cumulative experience of 520,230 SGs were recorded. A total of 689 (80%) and 764 (89%) surgeons listed 13 absolute and relative contraindications, respectively. 65% (n = 559) surgeons perform routine preoperative endoscopy and 97% (n = 835) routinely use intraoperative orogastric tube for sizing the resection. A wide variation is observed in the diameter of the tube used. 73% (n = 627) surgeons start dividing the stomach at a distance of 3-5 cm from the pylorus, and 54% (n = 467) routinely use staple line reinforcement. Majority (65%, n = 565) of surgeons perform routine intraoperative leak test at the end of the procedure, while 25% (n = 218) surgeons perform a routine contrast study in the early postoperative period. Lifelong multivitamin/mineral, iron, vitamin D, calcium, and vitamin B12 supplementation is advocated by 66%, 29%, 40%, 38% and 44% surgeons, respectively.There is a considerable variation in the perioperative practices concerning SG. Data can help in identifying areas for future consensus building and more focussed studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673265>The Incidence of  in the Combination of Allergic Rhinitis and Diabetes Mellitus.</a></h1><p> mites are permanent ectoparasites of human pilosebaceous unit. They mainly infect skin of the face and scalp. Many studies have shown higher density of the ectoparasites in diseased inflammatory skin than in normal skin. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of  (DF) in treatment-resistant patients with the combination of allergic rhinitis (AR) and diabetes mellitus (DM).This study was conducted in 2014-2017. It included 92 patients aged 18-70 years who presented at the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) and Endocrinology Polyclinics of Mustafa Kemal University Medical Faculty Hospital, Turkey. An age and gender matched control group was formed of 30 healthy individuals. To determine the presence of DF, a few eyelashes were taken from eyelids in both groups. Then samples were examined under a light microscope.DF positivity was determined in 44 (47.8%) of the 92 patients and in 1 (3.3%) of the 30 control group subjects. In the patient group, DF positivity was evaluated as present in 14 (43.7%) of the DM patients, in 12 (40%) of the AR patients and in 18 (60%) of the AR+DM patients. Statistically significant DF incidence was found in all three patient groups compared to the control group (=0.001). The incidence in AR + DM group was not different from other patient groups.DM, AR, advanced age and  had prepared the environment for  infestations. This issue should be considered especially in treatment of patients with AR+DM.Copyright© Iranian Society of Parasitology & Tehran University of Medical Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683140>Nursing students' attitudes towards obese people, knowledge of  risk, and self-disclosure of own health behaviours: An exploratory survey.</a></h1><p>The rates of people being overweight and obese are recognised as global public health concerns. Negative attitudes towards obese and overweight people are prevalent among health care professionals. Nurses and nursing students have a significant role in health promotion of people who are obese or overweight and can assist people in achieving healthy lifestyles. However, evidence suggests that nurses and nursing students fail to engage in healthy lifestyles themselves and display negative attitudes towards obese and overweight people. Such negative behaviours put nurses and nursing students in a precarious position when advising overweight and obese people to adopt healthy lifestyles.This study aimed to ascertain nursing students'  risk knowledge, their attitudes towards obese and overweight people, and their own health promoting lifestyle behaviours.A descriptive correlational study was used.One university in the United Kingdom.A total of 210 nursing students enrolled on a university degree course in Adult or Mental Health Nursing in years 1, 2 and 3.Data were collected using three valid and reliable questionnaires:  Risk Knowledge Scale, Attitudes Towards Obese Persons Scale and the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile. Dependent variables were correlated with independent variables on field of study, year of study, and gender.Results showed that nursing students engage in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours and fail to meet government recommended levels for physical activity. Nursing students had poor knowledge on  risk and displayed neutral attitudes towards overweight and obese people.Educational providers of nursing courses should embrace the need for nursing students to interrogate and enhance their own healthy lifestyle behaviours as an integral component of the pre-registration education course. This may strengthen the credibility and suitability of nursing students as future nurses in health promoting activities of patients who are overweight and obese.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We estimated the cost-effectiveness of this tax and an alternative tax scenario of 2 pesos per liter. We developed a cohort simulation model calibrated for Mexico to project the impact of the tax over ten years. The current tax is projected to prevent 239,900 cases of , 39 percent of which would be among children. It could also prevent 61,340 cases of diabetes, lead to gains of 55,300 quality-adjusted life-years, and avert 5,840 disability-adjusted life-years. The tax is estimated to save $3.98 per dollar spent on its implementation. Doubling the tax to 2 pesos per liter would nearly double the cost savings and health impact. Countries with comparable conditions could benefit from implementing a similar tax.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677016>Definitions of Long-Term Weight Regain and Their Associations with Clinical Outcomes.</a></h1><p>The prevalence and clinical significance of weight regain after bariatric surgery remains largely unclear due to the lack of a standardized definition of significant weight regain. The development of a clinically relevant definition of weight regain requires a better understanding of its clinical significance.To assess rates of weight regain 5 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG), applying six definitions and investigating their association with clinical outcomes.Patients were followed up until 5 years after surgery and weight regain was calculated. Regression techniques were used to assess the association of weight regain with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the presence of comorbidities.A total of 868 patients participated in the study, with a mean age of 46.6 (± 10.4) years, of which 79% were female. The average preoperative BMI was 44.8 (± 5.9) kg/m and the total maximum weight loss was 32% (± 8%). Eighty-seven percent experienced any regain. Significant weight regain rates ranged from 16 to 37% depending on the definition. Three weight regain definitions were associated with deterioration in physical HRQoL (p < 0.05), while associations between definitions of weight regain and the presence of comorbidities 5 years after surgery were not significant.These results indicate that identifying one single categorical definition of clinically significant weight regain is difficult. Additional research into the clinical significance of weight regain is needed to inform the development of a standardized definition that includes all dimensions of surgery success: weight, HRQoL, and comorbidity remission.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672146>Short-term treatment with high dose liraglutide improves lipid and lipoprotein profile and changes hormonal mediators of lipid metabolism in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind clinical trial.</a></h1><p>Long-term treatment with up to 1.8 mg liraglutide improves cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is currently under investigation in subjects without diabetes. Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3 mg) short-term (5 weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes affects metabolites, lipid and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way.Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3 mg or placebo for 5 weeks. Metabolites, fatty acids, lipid-lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment.Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for weight loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total lipid concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially weight-loss related. Tyrosine levels were reduced and behenic acid levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type 2 diabetes with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in lipid-lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.
