Linoleic  and  both give rise to other long-chain fatty  derivatives, including gamma- and arachidonic  (omega-6 fatty acids) and docosahexaenoic  and eicosapentaenoic  (omega-3 fatty acids). These fatty acids are showing promise as safe adjunctive treatments for many skin disorders, including atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, acne vulgaris, systemic lupus erythematosus, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and melanoma. Their roles are diverse and include maintenance of the stratum corneum permeability barrier, maturation and differentiation of the stratum corneum, formation and secretion of lamellar bodies, inhibition of proinflammatory eicosanoids, elevation of the sunburn threshold, inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and interleukin-12), inhibition of lipoxygenase, promotion of wound healing, and promotion of apoptosis in malignant cells, including melanoma. They fulfill these functions independently and through the modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and Toll-like receptors.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Yet, the first step of the pathway, the liberation of  following induction, is poorly understood. Phospholipases D (PLDs) have been hypothesized to mediate this process, but data from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) regarding the role of PLDs in plant resistance have remained controversial. Here, we cloned two chloroplast-localized PLD genes from rice (Oryza sativa), OsPLDα4 and OsPLDα5, both of which were up-regulated in response to feeding by the rice striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis, mechanical wounding, and treatment with jasmonic  (JA). Antisense expression of OsPLDα4 and -α5 (as-pld), which resulted in a 50% reduction of the expression of the two genes, reduced elicited levels of , JA, green leaf volatiles, and ethylene and attenuated the SSB-induced expression of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (OsMPK3), a lipoxygenase (OsHI-LOX), a hydroperoxide lyase (OsHPL3), as well as a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic  synthase (OsACS2). The impaired oxylipin and ethylene signaling in as-pld plants decreased the levels of herbivore-induced trypsin protease inhibitors and volatiles, improved the performance of SSB and the rice brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, and reduced the attractiveness of plants to a larval parasitoid of SSB, Apanteles chilonis. The production of trypsin protease inhibitors in as-pld plants could be partially restored by JA, while the resistance to rice brown planthopper and SSB was restored by green leaf volatile application. Our results show that phospholipases function as important components of herbivore-induced direct and indirect defenses in rice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16501443>[Lipids in enteral nutrition: does an optimal ratio between omega-6 and omega-3 exist?].</a></h2><p>The ratio between PUFA omega-6 and omega-3 is 3:1 in the unweaned, 5:1 in the young man, 5-10:1 in the adult. The PUFA omega-6 prevail over omega-3 because of elongation and desaturation processes. Linoleic  is the beginning of the omega-6 series, a- of the omega-3 series. Both acids give rise to PUFA which must be introduced with diet because the human race is not able to synthetize. They represent the 2-6% of total daily caloric intake and correspond about to 10 g every day according to LARN 1986-1987. During some diseases (after surgery, trauma, sepsis, etc.) their need increases until 25-50 g every day, so it is necessary a proper enteral nutrition (EN). For this reason the bromatological composition of diets for EN must respect the physiological ratio between omega-6 and omega-3 PUFA. The composition of 37 diets for EN was examined and it was found that 7 (18%) have a proper ratio between the two series of PUFA. Twenty-three (62%) do not signal any ratio, two have 6:1, two 4.5:1, in three the ratio is in favour of omega-3. Then the concentration of linoleic and alfa- was examined and it was found that 24 (64%) diets signal the concentration of linoleic , 10 (27%) of both acids, two have no data about and only one diet reports the concentration of alfa-. A more exact formulation of PUFA into the composition of EN diets is suggested because PUFA are now recognized to play an important role in the fields of inflammation and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21294872>The elicitation of a systemic resistance by Pseudomonas putida BTP1 in tomato involves the stimulation of two lipoxygenase isoforms.</a></h2><p>Some non-pathogenic rhizobacteria called Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) possess the capacity to induce in plant defense mechanisms effective against pathogens. Precedent studies showed the ability of Pseudomonas putida BTP1 to induce PGPR-mediated resistance, termed ISR (Induced Systemic Resistance), in different plant species. Despite extensive works, molecular defense mechanisms involved in ISR are less well understood that in the case of pathogen induced systemic acquired resistance.We analyzed the activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and lipoxygenase (LOX), key enzymes of the phenylpropanoid and oxylipin pathways respectively, in tomato treated or not with P. putida BTP1. The bacterial treatment did not stimulate PAL activity and linoleate-consuming LOX activities. Linolenate-consuming LOX activity, on the contrary, was significantly stimulated in P. putida BTP1-inoculated plants before and two days after infection by B. cinerea. This stimulation is due to the increase of transcription level of two isoforms of LOX: TomLoxD and TomLoxF, a newly identified LOX gene. We showed that recombinant TomLOXF preferentially consumes  and produces 13-derivative of fatty acids. After challenging with B. cinerea, the increase of transcription of these two LOX genes and higher -consuming LOX activity were associated with a more rapid accumulation of free 13-hydroperoxy-octadecatrienoic and 13-hydroxy-octadecatrienoic acids, two antifungal oxylipins, in bacterized plants.In addition to the discovery of a new LOX gene in tomato, this work is the first to show differential induction of LOX isozymes and a more rapid accumulation of 13-hydroperoxy-octadecatrienoic and 13-hydroxy-octadecatrienoic acids in rhizobacteria mediated-induced systemic resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10233322>Double-blind, multicentre analysis of the efficacy of borage oil in patients with atopic eczema.</a></h2><p>Although gamma- (GLA) has been shown to correct deficiencies in skin lipids associated with reduced delta-6-desaturase activity which should result in improvement of dysregulation of inflammation and  in atopic eczema, clinical studies with evening primrose oil containing 10% GLA have yielded contradictory results. We have therefore examined the effect of a higher percentage (at least 23%) GLA-containing borage oil in adults with stable atopic eczema of moderate severity in a double-blind, multicentre study. One hundred and sixty patients were randomized to take daily either 500 mg of borage oil-containing capsules or the bland lipid miglyol as a placebo over a 24-week period. Use of topical diflucortolone-21-valerate cream was allowed as rescue medication, with the amount used until response being defined as primary, and clinical improvement as secondary efficacy criteria. Although several clinical symptoms improved compared with placebo, the overall response to borage oil did not reach statistical significance. Significant differences in favour of borage oil were, however, observed in a subgroup excluding patients who failed to show increased erythrocyte dihomo-gamma- levels and in whom adherence to inclusion criteria and the study protocol were questionable. GLA metabolites increased in borage oil-treated patients only, and serum IgE showed a trend to decrease on overall and subgroup analysis. No substance-related adverse effects were observed. This study shows no overall efficacy of GLA-containing borage oil in atopic eczema, with steroid use being the primary response parameter, although it suggests that a subgroup of patients may benefit from this well-tolerated treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24240437>Erythrocyte membrane docosapentaenoic  levels are associated with islet autoimmunity: the Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young.</a></h2><p>We previously reported that lower n-3 fatty  intake and levels in erythrocyte membranes were associated with increased risk of islet autoimmunity (IA) but not progression to type 1 diabetes in children at increased risk for diabetes. We hypothesise that specific n-3 fatty acids and genetic markers contribute synergistically to this increased risk of IA in the Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY).DAISY is following 2,547 children at increased risk for type 1 diabetes for the development of IA, defined as being positive for glutamic  decarboxylase (GAD)65, IA-2 or insulin autoantibodies on two consecutive visits. Using a case-cohort design, erythrocyte membrane fatty acids and dietary intake were measured prospectively in 58 IA-positive children and 299 IA-negative children.Lower membrane levels of the n-3 fatty , docosapentaenoic  (DPA), were predictive of IA (HR 0.23; 95% CI 0.09, 0.55), while α- (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) were not, adjusting for HLA and diabetes family history. We examined whether the effect of dietary intake of the n-3 fatty  ALA on IA risk was modified by fatty  elongation and desaturation genes. Adjusting for HLA, diabetes family history, ethnicity, energy intake and questionnaire type, ALA intake was significantly more protective for IA in the presence of an increasing number of minor alleles at FADS1 rs174556 (pinteraction = 0.017), at FADS2 rs174570 (pinteraction = 0.016) and at FADS2 rs174583 (pinteraction = 0.045).The putative protective effect of n-3 fatty acids on IA may result from a complex interaction between intake and genetically controlled fatty  desaturation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8194587>Antiproliferative effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids and interleukin-2 on normal and abnormal human lymphocytes.</a></h2><p>The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), linoleic  (LA),  (ALA), gamma  (GLA), arachidonic  (AA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), showed inhibition of growth of both normal and abnormal (Molt-4) human lymphocytes, and inhibition was concentration-dependent. Interestingly, the production of the lymphokine Interleukin-2 (IL-2) was elevated in Molt-4 cells, but it was reduced in the normal human lymphocytes. Addition of GLA or IL-2 or a combination of both showed enhancement of SO2.- and of lipid peroxidation levels, which were significantly higher in Molt-4 cells than in the normal lymphocytes. Reduction of protein concentration was also observed in both types of cells during this treatment. The data showed that the antiproliferative effects of GLA and IL-2 may partly be exerted through the elevated production of superoxide free radicals and peroxidation products. This is a novel finding and therefore, further exploitation of combinations of PUFAs and IL-2 may be a possible way of combating cancer cell growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12848277>Fatty acids, the immune response, and autoimmunity: a question of n-6 essentiality and the balance between n-6 and n-3.</a></h2><p>The essentiality of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is described in relation to a thymus/thymocyte accretion of arachidonic  (20:4n-6, AA) in early development, and the high requirement of lymphoid and other cells of the immune system for AA and linoleic  (1 8:2n-6, LA) for membrane phospholipids. Low n-6 PUFA intakes enhance whereas high intakes decrease certain immune functions. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies for a role of AA metabolites in immune cell development and functions shows that they can limit or regulate cellular immune reactions and can induce deviation toward a T helper (Th)2-like immune response. In contrast to the effects of the oxidative metabolites of AA, the longer-chain n-6 PUFA produced by gamma- (18:3n-6, GLA) feeding decreases the Th2 cytokine and immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 antibody response. The n-6 PUFA, GLA, dihomo-gamma- (20:3n-6, DHLA) and AA, and certain oxidative metabolites of AA can also induce T-regulatory cell activity, e.g., transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-producing T cells; GLA feeding studies also demonstrate reduced proinflammatory interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production. Low intakes of long-chain n-3 fatty acids (fish oils) enhance certain immune functions, whereas high intakes are inhibitory on a wide range of functions, e.g., antigen presentation, adhesion molecule expression, Th1 and Th2 responses, proinflammatory cytokine and eicosanoid production, and they induce lymphocyte apoptosis. Vitamin E has a demonstrable critical role in long-chain n-3 PUFA interactions with immune functions, often reversing the effects of fish oil. The effect of dietary fatty acids on animal autoimmune disease models depends on both the autoimmune model and the amount and type of fatty acids fed. Diets low in fat, essential fatty  deficient (EFAD), or high in long-chain n-3 PUFA from fish oils increase survival and reduce disease severity in spontaneous autoantibody-mediated disease, whereas high-fat LA-rich diets increase disease severity. In experimentally induced T cell-mediated autoimmune disease, EFAD diets or diets supplemented with long-chain n-3 PUFA augment disease, whereas n-6 PUFA prevent or reduce the severity. In contrast, in both T cell- and antibody-mediated autoimmune disease, the desaturated/elongated metabolites of LA are protective. PUFA of both the n-6 and n-3 families are clinically useful in human autoimmune-inflammatory disorders, but the precise mechanisms by which these fatty acids exert their clinical effects are not well understood. Finally, the view that all n-6 PUFA are proinflammatory requires revision, in part, and their essential regulatory and developmental role in the immune system warrants appreciation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7911749>Circulating autoantibodies directed against conjugated fatty acids in sera of HIV-1-infected patients.</a></h2><p>Several reports have demonstrated that major changes occur in the fatty  content of HIV-infected cells. In order to evaluate if these changes are recognized by the immune system, we have attempted to assay the possible presence of autoantibodies (autoAb) directed against conjugated fatty acids (CFA). Using an adapted ELISA, anti-CFA autoAb were assayed in sera of 150 HIV-1-infected patients and 116 controls (healthy donors and patients suffering from other diseases). Significantly increased anti-CFA autoAb of IgG class were found in HIV-1-infected patients (alpha < 0.001). Using our ELISA method and CFA differing in their length and their degree of unsaturation (lauric, myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, , linoleic, lignoceric, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids), it was demonstrated that the acyl chain of CFA is the immunodominant part recognized by these autoAb. Anti-CFA autoAb were present in 15/52 asymptomatic carriers, 14/36 symptomatic carriers, 16/39 ARC patients, but only 3/23 AIDS patients. Anti-CFA activity seemed to be linked with the CD4+ T cell count, and was not related to the total IgG amounts. Anti-CFA autoAb could result from self-antigen presentation to immunological cells, and may reflect lipid membrane modifications occurring in HIV-infected cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8827697>The ratio of n-6 to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the rat diet alters serum lipid levels and lymphocyte functions.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have reported that feeding rats diets rich in fish oils, which contain high proportions of the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, results in lowering of blood lipid levels and suppression of lymphocyte functions tested ex vivo and in vivo. The effects of other n-3 PUFA, such as , which is found in high proportions in linseed oil, are not as well documented. Therefore, in the present study, weanling male rats were fed for six weeks on one of five high-fat (20% by weight) diets made by mixing together sunflower and linseed oils; the resulting blends had n-6/n-3 PUFA ratios of 112.5:1 (pure sunflower oil), 14.8:1, 6.5:1, 0.81:1, and 0.33:1 (pure linseed oil); the levels of all other components in the diet were identical. The final body weight and total dissectable fat were lowest in rats fed the pure linseed oil diet. Serum cholesterol, triacylglycerol and nonesterified fatty  concentrations decreased as the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio of the diet decreased. The fatty  composition of the serum and of spleen lymphocytes was influenced by the diet fed-there was a progressive decrease in the proportions of linoleic and arachidonic acids and a progressive increase in the proportion of  as the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio of the diet decreased. Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids were detected in the serum but not in spleen lymphocytes. Inclusion of  in the diet resulted in significant suppression of spleen lymphocyte proliferation in response to the T-cell mitogen concanavalin A and in spleen lymphocyte natural killer cell activity, both measured ex vivo. The localized graft vs. host response, a measure of cell-mediated  in vivo, progressively decreased as the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio of the diet decreased. Thus, this study shows that dietary  results in lowered blood lipid levels and suppressed lymphocyte functions ex vivo and in vivo. With respect to these effects,  is as potent as dietary fish oil.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9042389>Effect of dietary flaxseed on fatty  composition, superoxide, nitric oxide generation and antilisterial activity of peritoneal macrophages from female Sprague-Dawley rats.</a></h2><p>The impact of ground flaxseed (FS) or flaxseed meal (FSM) diets on the fatty  composition and functions of rat peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) was determined. Female weanling Sprague-Dawley rats (10/group) were fed isocaloric AIN-76 diets supplemented with 0.0, 10.0% (w/w) FS or 6.2% (w/w) FSM. At the end of 56-days, rat serum and thioglycollate-elicited PEC were analyzed for total lipid fatty acids. Production of nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O2-), Listeria monocytogenes (LM) phagocytic index and antilisterial activity of resident PEC were also assessed. A significant increase in  (C18:3), eicosapentanoic (C20:5) and docosahexanoic (C22:6) acids, as well as a significant reduction in arachidonic  (C20:4) was observed in the serum of rats fed 10% FS. Dietary FS caused a significant reduction in palmitic  (C16:0) and an increase in stearic  (C18:0) of PEC. Defatted FSM produced a significant increase in long chain fatty acids, which included eicosadienoic  (C20:2) in PEC and C22:6 in serum. PEC from rats fed 10.0% FS produced significantly less (about 50%) O2- in response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), than did PEC from control animals; dietary treatment had no effect on O2- in response to LM. FSM had no impact on the O2- production by PEC in response to PMA or LM. Antilisterial activity of PEC was determined by comparing bacterial uptake after 1 hr with recovery 24 hrs later. Despite comparably equivalent bacterial uptake, few viable intracellular LM were recovered at T = 24 for all test samples, indicating that, regardless of the dietary treatment, PEC were able to handle the in vitro LM infection. This bacterial clearance was accompanied by equivalent NO generation by PEC from each dietary group in response to LM. Summarily, dietary FS produced significant changes in fatty  composition of serum and PEC, inhibited O2- generation by PEC, and was ineffectual to both NO production by and antilisterial activity of PEC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7938085>Effect of prostaglandins and their precursors on the proliferation of human lymphocytes and their secretion of tumor necrosis factor and various interleukins.</a></h2><p>Cytokines, released by T cells, participate in inflammation and produce tissue injury. Excess production of cytokines such as interleukins (ILs) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is believed to be involved in the pathobiology of conditions such as septicemia and septic shock, collagen vascular diseases, glomerulonephritis etc. On the other hand, prostaglandins (PGs) are known to modulate inflammation, immune response, and T-cell response to antigens. But relatively little information is available on the effects of PGs and PG precursors on the release of cytokines. Here the authors present data which suggests that PGs including thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and their precursors such as dihomo-gamma  (DGLA), arachidonic  (AA) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) can inhibit T-cell proliferation and influence their ability to secrete IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and TNF in vitro.

Mature female cats (n=14/treatment) were fed control, fish oil or flaxseed oil diets with n-6:n-3 fatty  ratios of 20:1, 5:1 and 5:1, respectively, for 12 wk. Immune response was assessed on wk 0, 6 and 12, and skin hypersensitivity response on wk 6 and 12. Fish oil increased (P<0.01) eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids in plasma and skin, whereas flaxseed oil increased α-. Fish and flaxseed oils decreased (P<0.01) skin inflammatory response to histamine. Cats fed fish but not flaxseed oil had higher (P<0.05) skin leukotriene LTB(5), but not LTB(4). Fish and flaxseed oils lowered B, total T and T(h) subset populations, and leukocyte proliferative response to PWM (P<0.05). In contrast, there was no change in ConA- or PHA-induced lymphocyte proliferation, Tc and MHC II cell populations, DTH response, NK cytotoxicity, IL-2 production, or plasma IgG concentrations. Therefore, fish and flaxseed oil can reduce skin inflammatory responses in cats, however, flaxseed oil appears less immunosuppressive than fish oil.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Dihomo-GLA (DGLA) is synthesized directly from GLA and forms a substrate for cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, resulting in the synthesis of lipid mediators (eicosanoids). In the present study, the immunomodulatory effects of DGLA were investigated and compared with those of other relevant fatty acids. Freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were cultured in fatty  (100 microm)-enriched medium for 48 hr. Subsequently, cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 20 hr and the cytokine levels were measured, in supernatants, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Phospholipids were analysed by gas chromatography. Fatty acids were readily taken up, metabolized and incorporated into cellular phospholipids. Compared with the other fatty acids tested, DGLA exerted pronounced modulatory effects on cytokine production. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-10 levels were reduced to 60% of control levels, whereas IL-6 levels were not affected by DGLA. Kinetic studies showed that peak levels of TNF-alpha, occurring early after LPS addition, were inhibited strongly, whereas IL-10 levels were not affected until 15 hr after stimulation. Both the reduction of cytokine levels and the decrease in arachidonic  levels in these cells, induced by DGLA, were dose dependent, suggesting a shift in eicosanoid-subtype synthesis. However, although some DGLA-derived eicosanoids similarly reduced TNF-alpha levels, the effects of DGLA were probably not mediated by COX products, as the addition of indomethacin did not alter the effects of DGLA. In conclusion, these results suggest that DGLA affects cytokine production by human PBMC independently of COX activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16782068>Palmitic -induced activation of human T-lymphocytes and aortic endothelial cells with production of insulin receptors, reactive oxygen species, cytokines, and lipid peroxidation.</a></h2><p>Diabetic conditions are associated with hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, but the role of saturated fatty acids (SFA) vs. unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) in activation of T-lymphocytes and human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) is not known. We investigated in vitro effects of various concentrations of SFA (palmitate) and UFA (oleic, linoleic, , and arachidonic) acids in activation of these cells. These cells in presence of palmitate, but not UFA, exhibited time, and concentration-dependent emergence of insulin receptors, GLUT 4 expression, generation of ROS, cytokines, lipid peroxidation, and IRS-1. We conclude that both T-lymphocytes and HAEC share common characteristics in exhibiting activation of these cells to palmitate, but not to UFA, by developing insulin receptors and becoming insulin responsive tissues, a hitherto unknown response to palmitate. We hypothesize that these events may serve as protective defense mechanisms against acute effects of glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity in these cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29728958>Comparative compositional analysis of transgenic potato resistant to potato tuber moth (PTM) and its non-transformed counterpart.</a></h2><p>In this study, the compositions of transgenic potatoes (TPs) resistant to potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella) were compared with those of its non-transgenic (NTP) counterparts. The light inducible promoter, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase led to the expression of Cry1Ab only in the leaves and light-treated tubers of the TPs. No significant differences were found in the moisture, ash, dry weight, total soluble protein, carbohydrate, starch, fiber, ascorbate, cations, anions, fatty acids, and glycoalkaloids contents of TP and NTP. Moreover, light treatment significantly affected the contents of ascorbate, acetate and nitrite anions, palmitic, stearic and  fatty acids, α-haconine and α-solanine glycoalkaloids in TP and NTP tubers. While, significant differences were observed in the amino  contents in light-treated tubers of TPs than the NTP ones. Although, light treatment in potato tubers resulted in marked metabolic changes, all the variations observed in the metabolites compositions were found to be within the desired reference ranges for potato plants. In conclusion, the results indicated that the TPs were substantially and nutritionally equivalent to the NTP counterparts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6091179>Dietary fat, prostaglandins and the immune response.</a></h2><p>Events leading to the interest in dietary fat and  are summarized. This is followed by an account of the possible functions of prostaglandins and other eicosanoids in the immune response. Dietary studies on the influence of quantity and quality of fat on immune responses and the histopathology of lymphoid organs are critically reviewed. The next section deals primarily with work conducted in the authors' laboratories on essential fatty  deficiency and the immune response and on the effects of varying the ratio of dietary linoleic to  acids on prostaglandin synthesis by immunocompetent cells and immune functions. A brief account of a study on the influence of dietary fat on leukotriene synthesis follows.

These nutrients prevent lipid peroxidation, especially that of gamma-, dihomo-gamma- and arachidonic acids, the precursors of prostaglandins. Gammma- (GLA), dihomo-gamma- (DGLA), prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and prostacyclin can prevent genetic damage in vitro and in vivo. They augment immune responses and tumoricidal actions of macrophages. Prostacyclin also has anti-metastatic properties. Zinc, magnesium, calcium and pyridoxine are cofactors in the formation of GLA, DGLA, PGE1 and PGI2. Hence, in situations where there is a reduced intake of trace elements and vitamins, there may be a decrease in the synthesis of GLA, DGLA, PGE1 and PGI2, leading to immune suppression and genetic damage that cannot be reversed or prevented. In the presence of adequate amounts of selenium, beta-carotene and Vitamin A and E, peroxidation of GLA/DGLA/AA would not occur, so that they are available for the synthesis of PGE1 and PGI2. This interaction between nutrients, essential fatty acids and prostaglandins can be exploited to develop new preventive and therapeutic strategies in cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12934235>[Pathology of placenta of rats induced by fatty  deficiency].</a></h2><p>Lipids are important cell components, both from the structural and the functional point of view. Besides, they intervene in transporting functions, cell recognition and . Essential Fatty Acids (EFA) are important for the functional and structural maintenance of animal organisms. In our laboratory, it was demonstrated that one group of pregnant rats fed on an EFA deficient diet, and other group of rats fed on the same diet but with 5% of corn oil (rich in linoleic ) showed alterations on the development of the metrial gland. In the present work, 57 female rats of a Wistar strain were fed since weaning with one of the following diets: EFAD: deficient in essential fatty acids, COD: EFAD + 5% corn oil (linoleic  sufficient but alpha-linoleic  deficient); SAD: EFAD + 5% soy oil (both EFA sufficient) and CD: commercial diet. After 3 months the animals were sacrificed on the 13 th. day of gestation. Uteru's horns were dissected and the implantation sities were fixed on formol and embebbed in parafin. The observations were carried out with H/E coloured cross-sections and the corialantoidea placenta, the cities of implantations and the sitios of reabsortions were studied. The metrial gland of DAGE and DAM rats presented structural modifications compared to DC rats. The most relevant findings were: indifferentiation of the granulated metrial gland cells and an increase in the amount of connective tissue. In DAS rats, on the contrary, the aspect of the metrial gland was similar to the observed in the DC group. In the DAGE and the DAM groups Labyrinthium was enlarged with vascular septum group. Mean while DAS was similar to group DC (thin and vascular). Differences in the cities of implantations and reabsortions were not detected. The present results suggest that alpha-linolenico  is essential for the rat placenta to reach normal development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11895154>Fatty acids and lymphocyte functions.</a></h2><p>The immune system acts to protect the host against pathogenic invaders. However, components of the immune system can become dysregulated such that their activities are directed against host tissues, so causing damage. Lymphocytes are involved in both the beneficial and detrimental effects of the immune system. Both the level of fat and the types of fatty  present in the diet can affect lymphocyte functions. The fatty  composition of lymphocytes, and other immune cells, is altered according to the fatty  composition of the diet and this alters the capacity of those cells to produce eicosanoids, such as prostaglandin E2, which are involved in immunoregulation. A high fat diet can impair lymphocyte function. Cell culture and animal feeding studies indicate that oleic, linoleic, conjugated linoleic, gamma-, dihomo-gamma-, arachidonic, , eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids can all influence lymphocyte proliferation, the production of cytokines by lymphocytes, and natural killer cell activity. High intakes of some of these fatty acids are necessary to induce these effects. Among these fatty acids the long chain n-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic , appear to be the most potent when included in the human diet. Although not all studies agree, it appears that fish oil, which contains eicosapentaenoic , down regulates the T-helper 1-type response which is associated with chronic inflammatory disease. There is evidence for beneficial effects of fish oil in such diseases; this evidence is strongest for rheumatoid arthritis. Since n-3 fatty acids also antagonise the production of inflammatory eicosanoid mediators from arachidonic , there is potential for benefit in asthma and related diseases. Recent evidence indicates that fish oil may be of benefit in some asthmatics but not others.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1670594>Dietary  and immunocompetence in humans.</a></h2><p>We examined the effect of dietary  (ALA) on the indices of immunocompetence in 10 healthy free-living men (age 21-37 y) who consumed all meals at the Western Human Nutrition Research Center for 126 d. There was a stabilization period of 14 d at the start when all 10 subjects consumed basal diet (BD) and there were two intervention periods of 56 d each. Five of the subjects consumed the basal diet and the other five consumed flax-seed-oil diet (FD) during each intervention period. Feeding of FD suppressed the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells when they were cultured with phytohemagglutinin-P (P = 0.041) and concanavalin A (P = 0.054) and the delayed hypersensitivity response to seven recall antigens (NS). Concentrations of immunoglobulins in serum, C3, C4, salivary IgA, the numbers of helper cells, suppressor cells, and total T and B cells in the peripheral blood were not affected by the diets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2558092>[A new concept of the etiopathogenesis and prevention of atopic dermatitis].</a></h2><p>The hypothesis proposed for the pathogenesis of atopy links the well-known alterations in cell-mediated and humoral , the disturbances of mediator metabolism and the increased disposition of atopic epidermis for inflammation to a common underlying deficiency in the production of prostaglandin E1. The PGE1 deficiency is explained as the result of reduced delta-6-desaturase activity in atopic patients. The development of depressed cell-mediated  is regarded as a PGE1-dependent T-cell-maturation defect of the newborn's immune system post partum. Our hypothesis offers a novel approach to the prevention of atopy by administration of gamma- to newborns with increased risk of atopy and to nursing atopic mothers.

However, the processes that control the events and mediators involved in the activation of monocytes and their impact on the phagocytosis of bacteria are poorly understood. The effect of bacterial endotoxin, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), fatty acids and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on the phagocytosis of fluoroscein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled Escherichia coli (O157) by human blood monocytes and U937 cells was studied by flow cytometry. Endotoxin increased the phagocytosis of labelled bacteria by both monocytes and U937 cells. IL-1 beta and the polyunsaturated fatty acids; dihomo-gamma- and arachidonic acids also increased the phagocytic activity of both monocytes and U937 cells. In contrast, PGE2 suppressed phagocytosis in a concentration-dependent manner. The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, ketoprofen, further enhanced the increased phagocytic activity in the presence of endotoxin and interleukin-1 (IL-1) indicating suppression by endogenous prostaglandins. This was confirmed by the data which showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IL-1 increased PGE2 release and ketoprofen inhibited release. Endotoxin and fatty acids increased IL-1 beta release also, whereas PGE2 inhibited release. The data suggest that phagocytic activity may be linked to changes in IL-1 levels. The data presented in this study also suggest that monocyte phagocytosis in the course of bacterial infection would be altered during pathophysiological events which result in elevation of extracellular fatty acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7938096>Suppression of human T-cell growth in vitro by cis-unsaturated fatty acids: relationship to free radicals and lipid peroxidation.</a></h2><p>Cis-unsaturated fatty acids such as dihomogamma- (DGLA), arachidonic  (AA) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), which form precursors to 1, 2 and 3 series prostaglandins (PGs), have been shown to suppress human T-cell growth in vitro by a prostaglandin E (PGE)-independent mechanism. In an earlier study, we showed that these fatty acids can induce free radical generation in human neutrophils and tumor cells. Here we show that cis-unsaturated fatty acids augment free radical generation and lipid peroxidation in human T-cells. The growth suppressive action of cis-unsaturated fatty acids on human T-cells could be blocked by anti-oxidant, vitamin E and the superoxide anion quencher superoxide dismutase. These results suggest that c-UFAs-induced cell growth suppression is a free radical dependent process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10697856>15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HETE), a product of arachidonic  peroxidation, is an active component of hemozoin toxicity to monocytes.</a></h2><p>Several studies have shown that human and murine hemozoin-fed phagocytes are functionally impaired. Unpurified hemozoin contains unspecifically attached unsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic and  acids. The presence in unpurified hemozoin of large quantities of ferric heme with small amounts of free iron makes hemozoin a generator of oxidative radicals capable of forming lipoperoxides or other breakdown products from polyunsaturated fatty acids. Here we show that delipidized hemozoin had reduced toxicity to monocytes. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-elicited burst was poorly affected by delipidized hemozoin (ca. 17% and 21% burst inhibition by delipidized hemozoin vs ca. 75% and 65% burst inhibition by native hemozoin at 20 min or 17 h post-phagocytosis, respectively). Analysis of the lipid fraction isolated from native hemozoin by HPLC and chiral-phase HPLC showed equimolar amounts of 15(R)- and 15(S)-HETE (HETE, 15-hydroxy-6,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic ), most likely by-products of non-enzymatic peroxidation of arachidonic . The biologically active isomer, 15(S)-HETE, the product of 15-lipoxygenase, is a powerful mediator of inflammation and the effector of a large number of bioactions. 15(R,S)-HETE was found in native hemozoin (0.24 millimole/mole hemozoin heme), in supernatants of hemozoin-fed monocytes (87 nMol) and in hemozoin-fed monocytes (9.6 microMol). Approximately 84% of 15-HETE attached to hemozoin was in the esterified form. A large preponderance of esterified over free 15-HETE was also noted in supernatants of hemozoin-fed monocytes and in hemozoin-fed monocytes. In the latter cells, remarkable levels of the substance were attained. A dose-dependent curve of inhibition of PMA-elicited oxidative burst was observed. Assuming homogenuous distribution of 15-HETE in hemozoin-fed monocytes, 15(S)-HETE concentrations measured in hemozoin-fed monocytes (8 muMol) would bring about ca. 85% inhibition of PMA-elicited burst. In conclusion, derivatives of lipoperoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids such as 4-hydroxynonenal, 15-HETE and others now under study, appear to be relevant causes of hemozoin toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11237929>Dietary supplementation with eicosapentaenoic , but not with other long-chain n-3 or n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, decreases natural killer cell activity in healthy subjects aged >55 y.</a></h2><p>Animal studies showed that dietary flaxseed oil [rich in the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty   (ALA)], evening primrose oil [rich in the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty  gamma- (GLA)], and fish oil [rich in the long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA)] can decrease natural killer (NK) cell activity. There have been no studies of the effect on NK cell activity of adding these oils to the diet of humans.Our objective was to determine the effect of dietary supplementation with oil blends rich in ALA, GLA, arachidonic  (AA), DHA, or EPA plus DHA (fish oil) on the NK cell activity of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel study was conducted. Healthy subjects aged 55-75 y consumed 9 capsules/d for 12 wk; the capsules contained placebo oil (an 80:20 mix of palm and sunflower seed oils) or blends of placebo oil and oils rich in ALA, GLA, AA, DHA, or EPA plus DHA. Subjects in these groups consumed 2 g ALA, 770 mg GLA, 680 mg AA, 720 mg DHA, or 1 g EPA plus DHA (720 mg EPA + 280 mg DHA) daily, respectively. Total fat intake from the capsules was 4 g/d.The fatty  composition of plasma phospholipids changed significantly in the GLA, AA, DHA, and fish oil groups. NK cell activity was not significantly affected by the placebo, ALA, GLA, AA, or DHA treatment. Fish oil caused a significant reduction (mean decline: 48%) in NK cell activity that was fully reversed by 4 wk after supplementation had ceased.A moderate amount of EPA but not of other n-6 or n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can decrease NK cell activity in healthy subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4853010>Lipid peroxidation by human blood phagocytes.</a></h2><p>Cell suspensions enriched in human blood monocytes, obtained from normal peripheral blood by sedimentation on sodium diatrizoate-Ficoll gradients or from the blood of patients with neutropenia and monocytosis, accumulated malonyldialdehyde, a labile catabolite of lipid peroxidation, during incubations with polystyrene beads or heat-killed Staphylococcus epidermidis. Mixed blood leukocytes principally composed of granulocytes or granulocytes purified by density gradient sedimentation did not accumulate malonyldialdehyde during incubations with these particles, but did when ingesting particles containing linolenate. The phospholipid fatty  composition of monocyte-enriched and purified granulocyte preparations from the same donors were compared. The molar fraction of arachidonate (20:4) in phospholipids from monocyte-rich preparations was 62% greater than that of purified granulocytes. The findings indicate that human monocytes, possibly because of a greater content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in their membranes, peroxidize a greater quantity of endogenous lipids than granulocytes during endocytosis. Normal human granulocytes have the capacity to peroxidize ingested lipids. However, mixed leukocytes from two patients with chronic granulomatous disease produced little malonyldialdehyde when engulfing linolenate-containing particles. Therefore the capacity to peroxidize lipid is related to cellular oxygen metabolism, a function in which chronic granulomatous disease granulocytes are dificient. Malonyldialdehyde chemically prepared by hydrolysis of tetramethoxypropane, by extraction from peroxidized , or purified from extracts of phagocytizing rabbit alveolar macrophages had bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli and S. epidermidis. Therefore, toxic catabolites of lipid hydroperoxides may potentiate the bactericidal activity of hydrogen peroxide in mononuclear phagocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26011096>α- Fatty  Supplementation Decreases Tumor Growth and Cachexia Parameters in Walker 256 Tumor-Bearing Rats.</a></h2><p>Fish oil (FO) has been shown to affect cancer cachexia, tumor mass, and  cell. n-3 PUFA, specifically α- fatty  (ALA), has controversial effects. We investigated this in nontumor-bearing Wistar rats fed regular chow (C), fed regular chow and supplemented with FO or Oro Inca oil (OI), and Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats fed regular chow (W), fed regular chow and supplemented with FO (WFO) or OI (WOI). Rats were supplemented (1g/kg body weight/day) during 4 wk and then the groups tumor-bearing were inoculated with Walker 256 tumor cells suspension and 14 days later the animals were killed. WFO increased EPA fivefold and DHA 1.5-fold in the tumor tissue compared to W (P < 0.05). OI supplementation increased of threefold of ALA when compared to W (P < 0.05). Tumor mass in WFO and OI was of 2.3-fold lower, as well as tumor cell proliferation of 3.0-fold tumor tissue lipoperoxidation increased of 76.6% and cox-2 expression was 20% lower. Cachexia parameters were attenuate, blood glucose (25% higher), Triacylglycerolemia (50% lower), and plasma TNF-α (65% lower; P < 0.05) and IL-6 (62.5% lower).

AOS 13-HPOT (13-hydroperoxy-9,11,15-octadecatrienoic ) metabolizing activity assays assessed in various pearl millet cultivars with differential resistances against downy mildew revealed a positive correlation between cultivar resistance levels and AOS activities. Furthermore, the involvement of AOS in response to downy mildew was demonstrated by induction of AOS activity in both susceptible and resistant pearl millet cultivars during Sclerospora graminicola infection with higher induction observed in the resistant cultivar. Consistently, western blot analysis and tissue-blot immunoassay demonstrated the remarkable increase in AOS protein accumulation in the incompatible interaction. In addition, the tissue-blot immunoassay also showed the compartmentalization of AOS in the epidermis and vascular bundles of pearl millet seedlings. Expression analysis of a putative PgAOS1 gene revealed a marked difference in accumulation of PgAOS1 transcripts between contrasting plants, with pathogen-induced higher accumulation of the transcripts observed only in the resistant cultivar; a result which is in agreement with pathogen-induced AOS level and activity, indicating that PgAOS1 plays an important role in regulation of AOS level and activity in pearl millet upon S. graminicola infection. Our findings suggest an important role for AOS in regulation of responses to downy mildew disease in pearl millet. The differential AOS activities can potentially be used for selection of new disease-resistant pearl millet varieties, and the identified AOS-encoding gene(s) as genetic resource for development of enhanced downy mildew-resistant cultivars.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9175912>Gammalinolenic  and dihomogammalinolenic  suppress the CD3-mediated signal transduction pathway in human T cells.</a></h2><p>Gammalinolenic  (GLA; 18:3n6) and dihomogammalinolenic  (DGLA; 20:3n6) suppress lymphocyte activation, and GLA administration reduces joint swelling and tenderness in rheumatoid arthritis patients with active synovitis. In an effort to dissect the mechanisms whereby GLA, DGLA, and other fatty acids influence lymphocyte function, we examined their effects on anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb)-mediated early signaling events in human T cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C with or without 10 microg/ml fatty  and then loaded with the calcium binding fluorescent dye indo-1. Fatty acids did not affect the efficiency of indo-1 loading, and they did not alter cell surface membrane expression of the CD3 molecule. Anti-CD3 mAb (G19-4)-induced intracellular calcium [(Ca2+)i] changes were monitored by flow cytometry in negatively selected human T cells. The ratio of violet to blue fluorescence, which is proportional to (Ca2+)i, was measured over time. Cells enriched with GLA and DGLA but not cells enriched with eicosapentaenoic  (20:5n3) displayed a significant reduction in anti-CD3 mAb-induced early and late (Ca2+)i responses. T cells loaded with GLA, DGLA, or medium alone displayed similar increases in (Ca2+)i in response to the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2(+)-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin. Anti-CD3 mAb-mediated inositol phosphate production was also diminished in GLA- and DGLA-treated cells. These experiments suggest that GLA and DGLA suppress T cell activation by interfering with early events in the signal transduction pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15971520>Effects of dietary ratio of linoleic to  on performance, antibody production, and in vitro lymphocyte proliferation in two strains of leghorn pullet chicks.</a></h2><p>The effects of dietary ratio of linoleic  to  on performance, mitogenic lymphocyte proliferation, and antibody production were evaluated in Leghorn pullets during a rigorous vaccination program. Diets were supplemented with flaxseed and corn oil to achieve 4 dietary ratios of linoleic  to  [17:1 (control), 8:1, 4:1, or 2:1]. Each diet was fed to HyLine Brown or W-36 pullets from 1 d to 16 wk of age. Day-old pullets were randomly assigned to 8 replicate cages with 12 pullets per cage; the density was reduced to 8 pullets per cage at 11 wk of age. Dietary treatments did not affect body weight, feed consumption, or pullet mortality. At 12 wk of age, an interaction between diet and strain (P < or = 0.004) showed Hy-Line W-36 pullets fed the 2:1 ratio had greater antibody production against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine than those fed diets with higher ratios. At wk 16, pullets fed ratios of 4:1 and 2:1 had the greatest antibody production against NDV vaccine. Antibody production against infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) vaccine was also increased (P < 0.04) by ratios of 4:1 (2.244 optical density; OD) or 2:1 (2.508 OD) as compared with the control diet (1.576 OD). Hy-Line Brown pullets had greater antibody production against infectious bronchitis virus vaccine compared with Hy-Line W-36 pullets at 16 wk of age. These results indicate that feeding a reduced dietary ratio of linoleic to  by adding flaxseed to the diets enhanced antibody response to NDV and IBDV vaccines without any negative effects on pullet performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14729912>A plasma membrane protein from Zea mays binds with the herbivore elicitor volicitin.</a></h2><p>Volicitin (17-hydroxylinolenoyl-l-Gln) present in the regurgitant of Spodoptera exigua (beet armyworm caterpillars) activates the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) when in contact with damaged Zea mays cv Delprim (maize) leaves. VOC emissions in turn serve as a signaling defense for the plant by attracting female parasitic wasps that prey on herbivore larvae. A tritiated form of volicitin was synthesized and shown to induce volatiles in the same fashion as the biological form. [(3)H]-l-volicitin rapidly, reversibly, and saturably bound to enriched plasma membrane fractions isolated from Z. mays leaves with an apparent K(d) of 1.3 nM and a Hill coefficient of 1.07. Analog studies showed that the l-Gln and hydroxy moieties of volicitin play an important role in binding. Treatment of plants with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) increased the total binding of [(3)H]-l-volicitin to the enriched plasma membrane more than threefold, suggesting that MeJA activates transcription of the gene encoding the binding protein. S. exigua feeding also increased total binding fourfold. Cycloheximide pretreatment of plants significantly decreased binding of radiolabeled volicitin to the enriched plasma membrane. These data provide the first experimental evidence that initiation of plant defenses in response to herbivore damage can be mediated by a binding protein-ligand interaction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26363928>ω-6 (18:2) and ω-3 (18:3) fatty acids in reconstituted high-density lipoproteins show different functionality of anti-atherosclerotic properties and embryo toxicity.</a></h2><p>Among unsaturated fatty acids, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that ω-6 (linoleic ) and ω-3 () fatty acids show different associations with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), although its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. To determine why consumption of ω-3 fatty  is associated with lower risk of CVD, we investigated the biological functions of ω-6 (linoleic ) and ω-3 () in reconstituted HDL (rHDL) after encapsulation using human cells and zebrafish embryo. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is the principal protein behind the beneficial functions of HDL, which include potent anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-atherosclerotic activities in blood. Several rHDLs were synthesized with apoA-I and different molar ratio of ω-6 or ω-3 fatty . Both fatty acids showed similar solubility in rHDL up to a molar ratio of 95:5:1:10 (palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol:apoA-I:fatty ). Although both rHDL showed similar structural properties and α-helical contents, ω-6-rHDL showed loss of anti-oxidant ability against LDL oxidation. Uptake of acetylated LDL into macrophages was inhibited by ω-3-rHDL but not ω-6-rHDL, suggesting that ω-6-rHDL has higher pro-atherosclerotic activity. ω-3-rHDL showed more enhanced cholesterol efflux activity with less accumulation of triglyceride in the macrophage. ω-6-rHDL caused more senescence in human dermal fibroblast cells with cytotoxicity, while ω-3-rHDL treatment inhibited the senescence. In zebrafish embryo survivability, ω-3-rHDL-injected embryos showed 86±3% survival, whereas ω-6-rHDL-injected ones showed 72±2% survival as well as an elevated inflammatory response in zebrafish embryos. In conclusion, ω-6-rHDL and ω-3-rHDL show different physiological activities in atherosclerosis, , and cellular senescence.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, there have been few studies in humans. Therefore, we elected to investigate the effects of a variety of EFA [gamma- (GLA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA)] in vitro on human blood lymphocyte reactivity, cytokine secretion and natural cytotoxicity. The proliferative response to polyclonal mitogens (phytohaemagglutinin, pokeweed mitogen, concanavalin A), as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation into newly synthesized lymphocytes, was inhibited (P < 0.05) by all EFAs tested, in a dose-dependent manner (3-15 micrograms/ml). The greatest inhibition of proliferation was caused by EPA and DHA. Similarly, EPA, DHA and GLA significantly reduced cytotoxic activity [expressed as lytic units, using 51 chromium-release assays natural killer (NK) (K562 cells) and lymphokine-activated (LAK) (Daudi cells) cells] (P < 0.05) in a concentration-dependent manner (5-50 micrograms/ml), without affecting cell viability. EPA and DHA exhibited greater suppression than GLA. Furthermore, the inhibition of cell proliferation and suppression of natural cytotoxicity was associated with marked decrease in cytokine [interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)] production in vitro. Our findings demonstrate that EFAs (GLA, EPA, DHA) have the potential to inhibit significantly various aspects of human lymphocyte cell-mediated and humoral immune reactivities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10319914>Inhibition of angiogenic factor- and tumour-induced angiogenesis by gamma .</a></h2><p>Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is an essential feature of malignant tumour development. Gamma  (GLA), a n-6 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), inhibits the growth and metastasis of a variety of tumour cells, including breast, prostate, pancreatic cancer and hepatoma cells and also has anti-metastatic effects on endothelial cells. In the current study, we tested whether GLA inhibited angiogenesis induced by tumour cells. A rat aortic ring assay and in vitro tube formation of human vascular endothelial cells were used to determine angiogenesis (spontaneous, angiogenic factor- and tumour cells-induced). Inclusion of GLA in this 3-D matrix culture system significantly inhibited angiogenesis from aortic rings in a concentration-dependent manner. The results from tube formation of vascular endothelial cell further confirmed that GLA suppressed angiogenesis. Furthermore, in the cell motility assay (phagokinetic assay and endothelial wounding assay), a significant reduction of the motility of vascular endothelial cells by GLA was seen. It is concluded that gamma  inhibits angiogenic factor and tumour-induced angiogenesis in vitro at least in part via its inhibitory effect on the motility of vascular endothelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8561071>Immunologic effects of marine- and plant-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in nonhuman primates.</a></h2><p>The effect of marine- and plant-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on T cell-mediated immune response was studied in cynomolgus monkeys. Animals were first fed a 14-wk baseline diet; 10 animals were then fed diets containing 1.3% or 3.3% of energy as eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) plus docosahexaenoic  (DHA) which the other 10 were fed diets containing 3.5% or 5.3% of energy as  (ALA) for two consecutive 14-wk periods. Both diets significantly decreased the percentage of T cells (except 1.3% EPA + DHA), T helper cells (except 1.3% EPA + DHA and 3.5% ALA), and T suppressor cells. Proliferative response of lymphocytes to T cell mitogens significantly increased after the diet containing 3.3% EPA + DHA. Interleukin 2 production significantly increased after the diets containing 1.3% and 3.3% EPA + DHA. No significant changes in mitogenic response or interleukin 2 production were found after ALA diets. Feeding 1.3% or 3.3% EPA + DHA or 5.3% ALA significantly suppressed prostaglandin E2 production in response to T cell mitogens. Plasma tocopherol concentrations were decreased significantly only in monkeys fed ALA diets. We conclude that after adjustment for the tocopherol concentration, marine-derived n-3 PUFAs but not plant-derived n-3 PUFAs increased T cell-mediated mitogenic response and interleukin 2 production. This is most likely due to diet-induced quantitative differences in cellular fatty  composition and, thus, in prostaglandin E2 production and tocopherol status.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11435508>Dietary supplementation with gamma- or fish oil decreases T lymphocyte proliferation in healthy older humans.</a></h2><p>Animal and human studies have shown that greatly increasing the amounts of flax seed oil [rich in the (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA)  (ALNA)] or fish oil [FO; rich in the long chain (n-3) PUFA eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA)] in the diet can decrease mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dietary supplementation with moderate levels of ALNA, gamma- (GLA), arachidonic  (ARA), DHA or FO on the proliferation of mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and on the production of cytokines by those cells. The study was randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded and parallel. Healthy subjects ages 55-75 y consumed nine capsules/d for 12 wk; the capsules contained placebo oil (an 80:20 mix of palm and sunflower seed oils) or blends of placebo oil with oils rich in ALNA, GLA, ARA or DHA or FO. Subjects in these groups consumed 2 g of ALNA or 770 mg of GLA or 680 mg of ARA or 720 mg of DHA or 1 g of EPA plus DHA (720 mg of EPA + 280 mg of DHA) daily from the capsules. Total fat intake from the capsules was 4 g/d. The fatty  composition of PBMC phospholipids was significantly changed in the GLA, ARA, DHA and FO groups. Lymphocyte proliferation was not significantly affected by the placebo, ALNA, ARA or DHA treatments. GLA and FO caused a significant decrease (up to 65%) in lymphocyte proliferation. This decrease was partly reversed by 4 wk after stopping the supplementation. None of the treatments affected the production of interleukin-2 or interferon-gamma by PBMC and none of the treatments affected the number or proportion of T or B lymphocytes, helper or cytotoxic T lymphocytes or memory helper T lymphocytes in the circulation. We conclude that a moderate level GLA or EPA but not of other (n-6) or (n-3) PUFA can decrease lymphocyte proliferation but not production of interleukin-2 or interferon-gamma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20386325>Effect of feeding a formula supplemented with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids for 14 weeks improves the ex vivo response to a mitogen and reduces the response to a soy protein in infants at low risk for allergy.</a></h2><p>Feeding long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCP) influences  in adults; however, less is known about their effect during development. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of feeding LCP on  in healthy infants during the first 4 months of life.Formula-fed infants were randomized at <or=14 days of age to standard term formula (Formula) or formula containing LCP (Formula+LCP). Infants exclusively fed human milk (HM) were included for comparison. At 16 weeks of age, blood was collected and phenotypes, the ability to proliferate and produce cytokines (interleukin [IL]-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, interferon [IFN]-gamma, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, TGF-beta) after incubation with phytohemaglutinin (PHA), beta-lactoglobulin, or soy protein were measured.Feeding LCP resulted in a higher than and more similar proliferation rate to PHA in HM-fed infants, possibly because of a greater TH1 type cytokine response and a higher percentage of antigen mature (CD45RO+) cells (P < 0.05). The response to beta-lactoglobulin did not differ among groups. After incubation with soy protein Formula+LCP, compared with Formula produced less IL-2 and more TNF-alpha and had a higher percentage of CD8+ and a lower percentage of CD20+ (CD20+CD54+) cells poststimulation (P < 0.05). Both formula groups produced less IL-2 after PHA, had a lower percentage of CD80+ cells, and a higher percentage of CD54+ cells after incubation with food proteins (P < 0.05).Formula-fed infants, at low risk for allergy, respond differently to mitogen and food proteins ex vivo than those fed HM. Feeding LCP altered some of these differences in the direction that is hypothesized to confer immune benefits.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28801523>Dietary modulation of oxylipins in cardiovascular disease and aging.</a></h2><p>Oxylipins are a group of fatty  metabolites generated via oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and are involved in processes such as inflammation, , pain, vascular tone, and coagulation. As a result, oxylipins have been implicated in many conditions characterized by these processes, including cardiovascular disease and aging. The best characterized oxylipins in relation to cardiovascular disease are derived from the ω-6 fatty  arachidonic . These oxylipins generally increase inflammation, hypertension, and platelet aggregation, although not universally. Similarly, oxylipins derived from the ω-6 fatty  linoleic  generally have more adverse than beneficial cardiovascular effects. Alternatively, most oxylipins derived from 20- and 22-carbon ω-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory, antiaggregatory, and vasodilatory effects that help explain the cardioprotective effects of these fatty acids. Much less is known regarding the oxylipins derived from the 18-carbon ω-3 fatty  α-, but clinical trials with flaxseed supplementation have indicated that these oxylipins can have positive effects on blood pressure. Normal aging also is associated with changes in oxylipin levels in the brain, vasculature, and other tissues, indicating that oxylipin changes with aging may be involved in age-related changes in these tissues. A small number of trials in humans and animals with interventions that contain either 18-carbon or 20- and 22-carbon ω-3 fatty acids have indicated that dietary-induced changes in oxylipins may be beneficial in slowing the changes associated with normal aging. In summary, oxylipins are an important group of molecules amenable to dietary manipulation to target cardiovascular disease and age-related degeneration. Oxylipins are an important group of fatty  metabolites amenable to dietary manipulation. Because of the role they play in cardiovascular disease and in age-related degeneration, oxylipins are gaining recognition as viable targets for specific dietary interventions focused on manipulating oxylipin composition to control these biological processes.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21285075>Dietary α- diminishes experimental atherogenesis and restricts T cell-driven inflammation.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological studies report an inverse association between plant-derived dietary α- (ALA) and cardiovascular events. However, little is known about the mechanism of this protection. We assessed the cellular and molecular mechanisms of dietary ALA (flaxseed) on atherosclerosis in a mouse model.Eight-week-old male apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE(-/-)) mice were fed a 0.21 % (w/w) cholesterol diet for 16 weeks containing either a high ALA [7.3 % (w/w); n = 10] or low ALA content [0.03 % (w/w); n = 10]. Bioavailability, chain elongation, and fatty  metabolism were measured by gas chromatography of tissue lysates and urine. Plaques were assessed using immunohistochemistry. T cell proliferation was investigated in primary murine CD3-positive lymphocytes. T cell differentiation and activation was assessed by expression analyses of interferon-γ, interleukin-4, and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) using quantitative PCR and ELISA. Dietary ALA increased aortic tissue levels of ALA as well as of the n-3 long chain fatty acids (LC n-3 FA) eicosapentaenoic , docosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic . The high ALA diet reduced plaque area by 50% and decreased plaque T cell content as well as expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and TNFα. Both dietary ALA and direct ALA exposure restricted T cell proliferation, differentiation, and inflammatory activity. Dietary ALA shifted prostaglandin and isoprostane formation towards 3-series compounds, potentially contributing to the atheroprotective effects of ALA.Dietary ALA diminishes experimental atherogenesis and restricts T cell-driven inflammation, thus providing the proof-of-principle that plant-derived ALA may provide a valuable alternative to marine LC n-3 FA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18320251>SNPs of the FADS gene cluster are associated with polyunsaturated fatty acids in a cohort of patients with cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>Polymorphisms of the human Delta-5 (FADS1) and Delta-6 (FADS2) desaturase genes have been recently described to be associated with the level of several long-chain n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in serum phospholipids. We have genotyped 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located on the FADS1-FADS2-FADS3 gene cluster (chromosome 11q12-13.1) in 658 Italian adults (78% males; mean age 59.7 +/- 11.1 years) participating in the Verona Heart Project. Polymorphisms and statistically inferred haplotypes showed a strong association with arachidonic  (C20:4n-6) levels in serum phospholipids and in erythrocyte cell membranes (rs174545 adjusted P value for multiple tests, P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Other significant associations were observed for linoleic (C18:2n-6),  (C18:3n-3) and eicosadienoic (C20:2n-6) acids. Minor allele homozygotes and heterozygotes were associated to higher levels of linoleic, , eicosadienoic and lower levels of arachidonic . No significant association was observed for stearidonic (C18:4n-3), eicosapentaenoic (C20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic (C22:6n-3) acids levels. The observed strong association of FADS gene polymorphisms with the levels of arachidonic , which is a precursor of molecules involved in inflammation and  processes, suggests that SNPs of the FADS1 and FADS2 gene region are worth studying in diseases related to inflammatory conditions or alterations in the concentration of PUFAs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24912701>Antioxidant enzymes and fatty  composition as related to disease resistance in postharvest loquat fruit.</a></h2><p>Two cultivars of loquat fruit were stored at 20°C for 10days to investigate the relationship between disease resistance, and fatty  composition and activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes. The results showed that decay incidence increased with storage time in both cultivars. A significantly lower disease incidence was observed in 'Qingzhong' fruit than in 'Fuyang', suggesting 'Qingzhong' had increased disease resistance. Meanwhile, 'Qingzhong' fruit also had lower levels of superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide, and lower lipoxygenase activity, but higher levels of  and linoleic acids and higher activities of catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) compared with 'Fuyang'. These results suggest that the higher levels of  and linoleic acids and the higher activity of CAT and APX have a role in disease resistance of postharvest loquat fruit.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The fish were fed isoenergetic and isoprotein feeds containing SFO (group 100SFO) or LO (group 100LO) in quantities of 67 g kg/feed, and a mixture of oils: 47 g SFO and 20 g LO kg/feed (group 70SFO/30LO) and 20 g SFO and 47 g LO kg/feed (group 30SFO/70LO). Dietary ratios of polyunsaturated fatty acids from the n-3 and n-6 series (n3/n6 index) were 0.36-2.15. Pikeperch were reared for 56 days in three replicates for each dietary treatment. Various dietary oils and ratios of n3/n6 did not impact fish growth, feed conversion ratio, viscerosomatic and hepatosomatic index, and size of the hepatocytes. Feeding the fish high quantities of LO and SO oils (groups 100LO and 100SFO) reduced the immunological response of the phagocytes and lymphocytes in the fish. Moreover, this resulted in significant differences among groups in the quantity of  and linoleic  in whole fish bodies, viscera, fillets, and livers. Various quantities of vegetable oils in the fish diets did not impact the quantity of arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic  in the fillets and livers. The immunological index and low quantities of linoleic  in the fillets obtained in group 30SFO/70LO indicate that the n3/n6 dietary ratio of 1.35 was the most advantageous for feeding juvenile pikeperch feeds with vegetable oils.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6575097>Fatty acids and the inhibition of mitogen-induced lymphocyte transformation by leukemic serum.</a></h2><p>The effects of sera from 23 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia on mitogen-induced transformation of normal human lymphocytes were examined. All sera (100%) at diagnosis and 70% of those obtained during the induction of remission demonstrated inhibition of mitogen-induced lymphocyte transformation as evidenced by decreased uptake of [3H]thymidine. The inhibition could not be overcome by an increase in the mitogen concentration. Eighteen sera demonstrating a mean inhibition of 44.2% had elevated levels of free fatty acids (FFA) compared with five sera showing no inhibition (p value = 0.001). Inhibition, within the range produced by leukemic sera, could be achieved by the purified methyl esters of linoleic and  in this system. Flow cytometric analysis of mitogen-induced cycling of normal human lymphocytes suggested that deoxyribonucleic  (DNA) replication was inhibited by leukemic sera containing elevated levels of FFA after the G1 phase of cell cycling. Similar inhibition could be achieved by the methyl ester of  in this system. Gas chromatographic analysis revealed that sera demonstrating inhibition contained  (C18:3)  (p value = 0.015), and the majority showed one or more of the following: 1) a concentration of oleic (C18:1)  greater than 2 standard deviations (SD) above the mean of the control leukemic sera (i.e., those not demonstrating inhibition); 2) an arachidonic (C20:4) to C18:1 ratio that is reduced to greater than 2 SD below the mean of the control group; or 3) the presence of an unexpected fatty  fraction. The data raise the question of an influence of FFA and, specifically, an interplay of unsaturated fatty acids on immune function during the natural history of acute lymphocytic leukemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2848532>Suppression of monosodium urate crystal-induced acute inflammation by diets enriched with gamma- and eicosapentaenoic .</a></h2><p>A subcutaneous air pouch formed in Sprague-Dawley rats was used to study the effect of diets enriched in gamma- (GLA) (in plant seed oil) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) (in fish oil) on acute inflammation induced by monosodium urate crystals. The GLA-enriched diet suppressed significantly the cellular phase of inflammation (polymorphonuclear leukocyte accumulation, crystal phagocytosis, and lysosomal enzyme activity), but it had little effect on the fluid phase (exudate volume and protein concentration). In contrast, the EPA-enriched diet suppressed the fluid phase but not the cellular phase of inflammation. The findings indicate that the fluid and cellular phases of acute inflammation can be controlled independently. A combined diet of fish oil and plant seed oil (EPA-enriched and GLA-enriched) reduced both the cellular and fluid phases of inflammation. Thus, dietary provision of alternative substrates for oxidative metabolism (other than arachidonic ) modifies monosodium urate crystal-induced acute inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15384491>Stimulation of the lipoxygenase pathway is associated with systemic resistance induced in bean by a nonpathogenic Pseudomonas strain.</a></h2><p>Systemic defense reactions induced in bean by the non-pathogenic Pseudomonas putida BTP1 strain reduced disease caused by Botrytis cinerea. Phenylalanine ammonialyase activity and the level of endogenous free salicylic  were compared in plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria-treated versus control plants, but no significant differences were detected. Furthermore, no enhanced fungitoxicity was detected in methanolic leaf extracts, suggesting that accumulation of bean phytoalexins was not part of the stimulated defense mechanisms. However, BTP1-inoculated plants showed increased levels of both linoleic and  acids. On this basis, we further investigated whether the lipoxygenase pathway, leading to antifungal phytooxylipins, could have been stimulated. Two key enzymatic activities of this metabolic route, namely lipoxygenase and hydroperoxide lyase, were significantly stimulated during the first four days after challenging BTP1-treated plants with the pathogen. This was observed in parallel with a more rapid consumption of the respective substrates of these enzymes, as revealed by measurements of endogenous concentrations of  and their hydroperoxide derivatives. Moreover, headspace-gas chromatography analyses showed significantly higher concentrations of the fungitoxic final product Z-3-hexenal in leaves from BTP1-inoculated beans as compared with control plants. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the oxylipin pathway can be associated with enhanced disease resistance induced in bean plants by nonpathogenic rhizobacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12173945>Effects of conjugated linoleic  supplementation during resistance training on body composition, bone density, strength, and selected hematological markers.</a></h2><p>Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are essential fatty acids that have been reported in animal studies to decrease catabolism, promote fat loss, increase bone density, enhance , and serve as an antiatherogenic and anticarcinogenic agent. For this reason, CLA has been marketed as a supplement to promote weight loss and general health. CLA has also been heavily marketed to resistance-trained athletes as a supplement that may help lessen catabolism, decrease body fat, and promote greater gains in strength and muscle mass during training. Although basic research is promising, few studies have examined whether CLA supplementation during training enhances training adaptations and/or affects markers of health. This study evaluated whether CLA supplementation during resistance training affects body composition, strength, and/or general markers of catabolism and . In a double-blind and randomized manner, 23 experienced, resistance-trained subjects were matched according to body mass and training volume and randomly assigned to supplement their diet with 9 g;pdd(-1) of an olive oil placebo or 6 g;pdd(-1) of CLA with 3 g;pdd(-1) of fatty acids for 28 days. Prior to and following supplementation, fasting blood samples, total body mass, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) determined body composition, and isotonic bench press and leg press 1 repetition maximums (1RMs) were determined. Results revealed that although some statistical trends were observed with moderate to large effect sizes, CLA supplementation did not significantly affect (p > 0.05) changes in total body mass, fat-free mass, fat mass, percent body fat, bone mass, strength, serum substrates, or general markers of catabolism and  during training. These findings indicate that CLA does not appear to possess significant ergogenic value for experienced resistance-trained athletes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22532855>Worm burden-dependent disruption of the porcine colon microbiota by Trichuris suis infection.</a></h2><p>Helminth infection in pigs serves as an excellent model for the study of the interaction between human malnutrition and parasitic infection and could have important implications in human health. We had observed that pigs infected with Trichuris suis for 21 days showed significant changes in the proximal colon microbiota. In this study, interactions between worm burden and severity of disruptions to the microbial composition and metabolic potentials in the porcine proximal colon microbiota were investigated using metagenomic tools. Pigs were infected by a single dose of T. suis eggs for 53 days. Among infected pigs, two cohorts were differentiated that either had adult worms or were worm-free. Infection resulted in a significant change in the abundance of approximately 13% of genera detected in the proximal colon microbiota regardless of worm status, suggesting a relatively persistent change over time in the microbiota due to the initial infection. A significant reduction in the abundance of Fibrobacter and Ruminococcus indicated a change in the fibrolytic capacity of the colon microbiota in T. suis infected pigs. In addition, ∼10% of identified KEGG pathways were affected by infection, including ABC transporters, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis as well as α- metabolism. Trichuris suis infection modulated host  to Campylobacter because there was a 3-fold increase in the relative abundance in the colon microbiota of infected pigs with worms compared to naïve controls, but a 3-fold reduction in worm-free infected pigs compared to controls. The level of pathology observed in infected pigs with worms compared to worm-free infected pigs may relate to the local host response because expression of several Th2-related genes were enhanced in infected pigs with worms versus those worm-free. Our findings provided insight into the dynamics of the proximal colon microbiota in pigs in response to T. suis infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27126789>Simultaneous quantitative profiling of 20 isoprostanoids from omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids by LC-MS/MS in various biological samples.</a></h2><p>Isoprostanoids are a group of non-enzymatic oxygenated metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids. It belongs to oxylipins group, which are important lipid mediators in biological processes, such as tissue repair, blood clotting, blood vessel permeability,  and immunity regulation. Recently, isoprostanoids from eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic, adrenic and α- namely F3-isoprostanes, F4-neuroprostanes, F2-dihomo-isoprostanes and F1-phytoprostanes, respectively have attracted attention because of their putative contribution to health. Since isoprostanoids are derived from different substrate of PUFAs and can have similar or opposing biological consequences, a total isoprostanoids profile is essential to understand the overall effect in the testing model. However, the concentration of most isoprostanoids range from picogram to nanogram, therefore a sensitive method to quantify 20 isoprostanoids simultaneously was formulated and measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The lipid portion from various biological samples was extracted prior to LC-MS/MS evaluation. For all the isoprostanoids LOD and LOQ, and the method was validated on plasma samples for matrix effect, yield of extraction and reproducibility were determined. The methodology was further tested for the isoprostanoids profiles in brain and liver of LDLR(-/-) mice with and without docosahexaenoic  (DHA) supplementation. Our analysis showed similar levels of total F2-isoprostanes and F4-neuroprostanes in the liver and brain of non-supplemented LDLR(-/-) mice. The distribution of different F2-isoprostane isomers varied between tissues but not for F4-neuroprostanes which were predominated by the 4(RS)-4-F4t-neuroprostane isomer. DHA supplementation to LDLR(-/-) mice concomitantly increased total F4-neuroprostanes levels compared to F2-isoprostanes but this effect was more pronounced in the liver than brain.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of modifying dietary n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio from plant and animal oil sources on performance, behavior, cytokine mRNA expression, antioxidative status and meat fatty  profile of broiler chickens. Birds ( = 420) were fed 7 diets enriched with different dietary oil sources and ratios as follows: sunflower oil in control diet (C); fish oil (FO); 1:1 ratio of sunflower oil to FO (C1FO1); 3:1 ratio of sunflower oil to fish oil (C3FO1); linseed oil (LO); 1:1 ratio of sunflower oil to linseed oil (C1LO1); 3:1 ratio of sunflower oil to linseed oil (C3LO1), resulting in dietary n-6:n-3 ratios of approximately 40:1, 1.5:1, 4:1, 8:1, 1:1, 2.5:1 and 5:1, respectively. The best final body weight, feed conversion ratio as well as protein efficiency ratio of broilers were recorded in the C1FO1 and C1LO1 groups. Compared with the control group, the dressing percentage and breast and thigh yield were highest in the C1FO1 and C1LO1 groups. Narrowing the dietary n-6:n-3 ratio increased ( < 0.05) n-3 PUFA content of breast meat. Moreover, the breast meat contents of eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  increased ( < 0.05) with increasing dietary FO whereas α- content was higher with LO supplementation. Also, enriching the diets with n-3 PUFA from FO and LO clearly decreased ( < 0.05) serum total cholesterol, triglycerides and very low-density lipoproteins and enhanced antioxidative status. The feeding frequency was decreased ( < 0.05) in the C1FO1 and C1LO1 groups. Likewise, n-3 PUFA-enriched diets enhanced the frequency of preening, wing flapping and flightiness. Animal oil source addition, compared to plant oil, to broiler diets enhanced the relative mRNA expression of interferon gamma, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-2 and interleukin-6 genes, especially at low n-6:n-3 ratios. This study has clearly shown that narrowing n-6:n-3 ratio through the addition of FO or LO improved performance and immune response of broilers and resulted in healthy chicken meat, enriched with long chain n-3 PUFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8086487>Inhibition of cytokine-stimulated thymic lymphocyte proliferation by fatty acids: the role of eicosanoids.</a></h2><p>The effect of individual fatty acids on the proliferation of thymic lymphocytes in response to interleukin-1 (IL-1) was investigated. Proliferation was estimated by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation into the  insoluble fraction of the thymocytes. A concentration-dependent inhibition (in the range 1-100 microM) in the IL-1-stimulated proliferation was observed with the C20 fatty acids dihomo-gamma- (DGLA), arachidonic  and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). A less pronounced concentration-dependent inhibitory response was observed with the C18 fatty acids linoleic ,  and gamma-. Palmitic  and oleic did not have any effect on either basal or IL-1-stimulated proliferation at concentrations up to 100 microM. The potencies of each fatty  for this effect at a concentration of 100 microM were: arachidonic  > EPA > or = DGLA > linoleic . DGLA, arachidonic  and EPA also attenuated IL-2-stimulated proliferation. The inhibitory action of these fatty acids was not mediated by conversion to prostaglandins or other eicosanoids as the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ketoprofen and NDGA did not alter their action. Incubation of thymocytes with radiolabelled DGLA and EPA followed by reverse-phase HPLC analysis revealed that DGLA is predominantly converted to a more polar metabolite which is not PGE1 whereas EPA does not appear to be converted to any other detectable metabolite. The data indicate that the inhibitory actions of fatty acids on cell proliferation do not occur as a result of conversion to other metabolites but may be direct effects. The inhibition of cytokine-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation by unsaturated fatty acids would imply that they may attenuate cell-mediated immune reactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3014282>A deficiency in dietary gamma- and/or eicosapentaenoic acids may determine individual susceptibility to AIDS.</a></h2><p>We hypothesize that a relative deficiency in gamma- and eicosapentaenoic acids and in their derivatives may contribute to the development of AIDS.

These roles include influences on infectious and non-infectious diseases including prevention of inflammation as well as mucosal  to infectious diseases. Cholera is an acute intestinal illness caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It occurs in developing nations and if left untreated, can result in death. While vaccines for cholera exist, they are not always effective and other preventative methods are needed. We set out to determine tolerable concentrations of three fatty acids (oleic, linoleic and  acids) and cholera toxin using mouse BALB/C macrophages and human intestinal epithelial cells, respectively. We solubilized the above fatty acids and used cell proliferation assays to determine the concentration ranges and specific concentrations of the fatty acids that are not detrimental to human intestinal epithelial cell viability. We solubilized cholera toxin and used it in an assay to determine the concentration ranges and specific concentrations of cholera toxin that do not statistically decrease cell viability in BALB/C macrophages. We found the optimum fatty  concentrations to be between 1-5 ng/μl, and that for cholera toxin to be < 30 ng per treatment. This data may aid future studies that aim to find a protective mucosal role for fatty acids in prevention or alleviation of cholera infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2258533>Food uses and health effects of corn oil.</a></h2><p>This review of corn oil provides a scientific assessment of the current knowledge of its contribution to the American diet. Refined corn oil is composed of 99% triacylglycerols with polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) 59%, monounsaturated fatty  24%, and saturated fatty  (SFA) 13%. The PUFA is linoleic  (C18:2n-6) primarily, with a small amount of  (C18:3n-3) giving a n-6/n-3 ratio of 83. Corn oil contains a significant amount of ubiquinone and high amounts of alpha- and gamma-tocopherols (vitamin E) that protect it from oxidative rancidity. It has good sensory qualities for use as a salad and cooking oil. Corn oil is highly digestible and provides energy and essential fatty acids (EFA). Linoleic  is a dietary essential that is necessary for integrity of the skin, cell membranes, the immune system, and for synthesis of icosanoids. Icosanoids are necessary for reproductive, cardiovascular, renal, and gastrointestinal functions and resistance to disease. Corn oil is a highly effective food oil for lowering serum cholesterol. Because of its low content of SFAs which raises cholesterol and its high content of PUFAs which lowers cholesterol, consumption of corn oil can replace SFAs with PUFAs, and the combination is more effective in lowering cholesterol than simple reduction of SFA. PUFA primarily lowers low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) which is atherogenic. Research shows that PUFA has little effect on high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) which is protective against atherosclerosis. PUFA generally improves the ratio of LDL-C to HDL-C. Studies in animals show that PUFA is required for the growth of cancers; the amount required is considered to be greater than that which satisfies the EFA requirement of the host. At this time there is no indication from epidemiological studies that PUFA intake is associated with increased risk of breast or colon cancer, which have been suggested to be promoted by high-fat diets in humans. Recommendations for minimum PUFA intake to prevent gross EFA deficiency are about 3% of energy (en%). Recommendations for prevention of heart disease are 8-10 en%. Consumption of PUFA in the United States is 5-7 en%. The use of corn oil to contribute to a PUFA intake of 10 en% in the diet would be beneficial to heart health. No single source of salad or cooking oil provides an optimum fatty  (FA) composition. Many questions remain to be answered about the relation of FA composition of the diet to various physiological functions and disease processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24931531>Effect of supplementing essential fatty acids to pregnant nonlactating Holstein cows and their preweaned calves on calf performance, immune response, and health.</a></h2><p>The objective was to evaluate the effect of supplementing saturated or unsaturated fatty acids (FA) during late gestation of cows and during the preweaning period of calves on growth, health, and immune responses of calves. During the last 8wk of pregnancy, Holstein cattle (n=96) were fed no fat supplement (control), a saturated FA (SFA) supplement enriched in C18:0, or an unsaturated FA supplement enriched in the essential FA linoleic . Newborn calves were fed a milk replacer (MR) with either low linoleic  (LLA; coconut oil) or high linoleic  (HLA; coconut oil and porcine lard) concentration as the sole feedstuff during the first 30d. A grain mix with minimal linoleic  was offered between 31 and 60d of life. At 30 and 60d of life, concentrations of linoleic  in plasma were increased in calves born from dams supplemented with essential FA compared with SFA (44.0 vs. 42.5% of total FA) and in calves consuming HLA compared with LLA MR (46.3 vs. 40.8% of total FA). Total n-3 FA concentration was increased in plasma of calves fed HLA compared with LLA MR (1.44 vs. 1.32%) primarily due to increased α-. Prepartum supplementation with SFA tended to improve dry matter intake (48.8 vs. 46.7kg) and improved average daily gain (0.50 vs. 0.46kg/d) by calves without affecting efficiency of gain or circulating concentrations of anabolic metabolites or hormones. Increasing mean intake of linoleic  from approximately 4.6 to 11.0g/d during the first 60d of life increased average daily gain (0.50 vs. 0.45kg/d) without a change in dry matter intake, thus improving feed efficiency (0.63 vs. 0.59kg of gain/kg of dry matter intake). Improved weight gain in calves fed HLA MR was accompanied by increased or tendency to increase plasma concentrations of glucose (92.7 vs. 89.9g/dL) and insulin-like growth factor I (59.5 vs. 53.2g/dL), increased hematocrit (36.0 vs. 34.4%) and concentration of blood lymphocytes (4.61 vs. 4.21×10(3)/μL), lowered plasma concentrations of -soluble protein (78.8 vs. 91.3mg/L) and blood platelets (736 vs. 822×10(3)/μL), and increased production of IFN-γ by peripheral blood mononuclear cells at 30d of age (48.1 vs. 25.6pg/mL), possibly indicating an earlier development of the immune system.

It was suggested that these effects are related to the formation of different series of eicosanoids, in particular prostaglandin-E (PGE). In this study we investigated whether prostaglandin subtypes metabolized from arachidonic  (PGE2), dihomo-gamma- (PGE1) or eicosapentaenoic  (PGE3) have different effects on T-cell proliferation and cytokine production in vitro. Freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence or absence of exogenous PGE1, PGE2 or PGE3. We found that tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and to a lesser extent interleukin (IL)-10 production was inhibited by all PGE-subtypes in ConA-stimulated PBMC concomitant with unaffected IL-2 levels. The modulated cytokine production of ConA stimulated cells was independent of T-cell proliferation. PGE2 and PGE1 moderately stimulated proliferation, while PGE3 inhibited the proliferative response to some extent. In LPS-stimulated PBMC, TNF-alpha production was inhibited by all PGE-subtypes, whereas IL-6 remained unaffected and IL-10 production was increased. Time course experiments on the effects of PGE-subtypes on cytokine production after ConA or LPS stimulation showed these effects to be time dependent, but indifferent of the prostaglandin subtype added. Overall, the modulatory effects of PGE on cytokine production were irrespective of the subtype. This may implicate that the immunomodulatory effects of PUFAs, with respect to cytokine production, are not caused by a shift in the subtype of PGE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15615018>Maternal dietary ratio of linoleic  to  affects the passive  of hatching chicks.</a></h2><p>The objective of the current study was to examine the effect of dietary ratio of linoleic  (LA) to  (LNA) on the humoral immune response in laying hens and further on the passive  of their progeny. Thirty-two Single Comb White Leghorn laying hens, 24 wk of age, were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 diets that had LA-to-LNA ratios of 0.8, 5.4, 12.5, and 27.7, respectively, by changing the proportions of sunflower and linseed oils. After 5 wk on the experimental diets, hens were immunized intramuscularly with 1 mg of BSA, followed by 2 boosters 2 and 6 wk later. Serum and egg yolk were obtained weekly from 0 to 6 wk following the first injection of BSA. One week after the second booster, fertile eggs were collected and incubated. The sera of 11-d-old embryos and hatchlings were collected. All serum samples were stored at -20 degrees C before analysis. The results showed that dietary LA-to-LNA ratio had no effect on the total IgG and BSA-specific antibody IgG concentrations in the serum or egg yolk of laying hens. Hatchlings from hens fed the diet containing the LA-to-LNA ratio of 12.4 showed lower (P < 0.05) BSA-specific IgG titer in the serum than those from hens given the diet containing LA-to-LNA ratio of 0.8. A lower (P < 0.05) total IgG concentration was observed in hatchlings from hens fed the diet containing LA-to-LNA ratio of 12.4 compared with those from hens fed diets containing 0.8 and 5.4 of LA-to-LNA ratios.

Here, we measured the effects of omega-3 (n-3), n-6 and n-9 fatty acids on the interaction between dendritic cells (DCs) and naïve T cells. Spleen DCs from BALB/c mice were cultured in vitro with ovalbumin (OVA) with 50 μM fatty acids; α-, arachidonic  (AA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), linoleic  or oleic  and thereafter OVA-specific DO11.10 T cells were added to the cultures. Fatty acids were taken up by the DCs, as shown by gas chromatography analysis. After culture with arachidonic  or DHA CD11c+ CD11b+ and CD11c+ CD11bneg DCs expressed more CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86 and PDL-1, while IAd remained unchanged. However, fewer T cells co-cultured with these DCs proliferated (CellTrace Violet low) and expressed CD69 or CD25, while more were necrotic (7AAD+). We noted an increased proportion of T cells with a regulatory T cell (Treg) phenotype, i.e., when gating on CD4+ FoxP3+ CTLA-4+, CD4+ FoxP3+ Helios+ or CD4+ FoxP3+ PD-1+, in co-cultures with arachidonic - or DHA-primed DCs relative to control cultures. The proportion of putative Tregs was inversely correlated to T-cell proliferation, indicating a suppressive function of these cells. With arachidonic  DCs produced higher levels of prostaglandin E2 while T cells produced lower amounts of IL-10 and IFNγ. In conclusion arachidonic  and DHA induced up-regulation of activation markers on DCs. However arachidonic - and DHA-primed DCs reduced T-cell proliferation and increased the proportion of T cells expressing FoxP3, indicating that these fatty acids can promote induction of regulatory T cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21599946>The impact of FADS genetic variants on ω6 polyunsaturated fatty  metabolism in African Americans.</a></h2><p>Arachidonic  (AA) is a long-chain omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) synthesized from the precursor dihomo-gamma- (DGLA) that plays a vital role in  and inflammation. Variants in the Fatty  Desaturase (FADS) family of genes on chromosome 11q have been shown to play a role in PUFA metabolism in populations of European and Asian ancestry; no work has been done in populations of African ancestry to date.In this study, we report that African Americans have significantly higher circulating levels of plasma AA (p = 1.35 × 10(-48)) and lower DGLA levels (p = 9.80 × 10(-11)) than European Americans. Tests for association in N = 329 individuals across 80 nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Fatty  Desaturase (FADS) locus revealed significant association with AA, DGLA and the AA/DGLA ratio, a measure of enzymatic efficiency, in both racial groups (peak signal p = 2.85 × 10(-16) in African Americans, 2.68 × 10(-23) in European Americans). Ancestry-related differences were observed at an upstream marker previously associated with AA levels (rs174537), wherein, 79-82% of African Americans carry two copies of the G allele compared to only 42-45% of European Americans. Importantly, the allelic effect of the G allele, which is associated with enhanced conversion of DGLA to AA, on enzymatic efficiency was similar in both groups.We conclude that the impact of FADS genetic variants on PUFA metabolism, specifically AA levels, is likely more pronounced in African Americans due to the larger proportion of individuals carrying the genotype associated with increased FADS1 enzymatic conversion of DGLA to AA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2550526>Is the origin of atopy linked to deficient conversion of omega-6-fatty acids to prostaglandin E1?</a></h2><p>Our hypothesis on the origin of atopy links alterations in omega-6-fatty  metabolism in atopic persons (i.e., reduced formation of delta-6-desaturase products) to deficient T cell differentiation and function. We suggest that a relative deficiency in dihomo-gamma--derived prostaglandin E1 is the major etiologic factor for diminished T cell maturation postpartum. Its precursors, gamma- and dihomo-gamma-, are physiologically provided in colostrum and mature breast milk of healthy mothers. Depressed cell-mediated  and uncontrolled B-cell response with increased IgE synthesis are explained as prostaglandin E1-dependent defects of T cell differentiation caused by insufficient supply of prostaglandin E1 precursors during early infancy.

Gestating sows (n = 16) were assigned to 1 of 2 weight- and parity-matched groups supplemented with 0% (C) or 0.5% (T) of a CLA preparation containing 50% CLA isomers. Supplementation started in late pregnancy and continued throughout lactation. At weaning, 80 piglets, half from each group of sows, were assigned to 0% CLA (C) or 0.5% CLA (T). Thus, there were four groups of 20 piglets: C-C, C-T, T-T, and T-C. Body weight and the number of piglets per litter at birth and weaning, and the chemical composition of colostrum did not differ among the groups. CLA affected the fatty  composition of colostrum fat; palmitoleic and gamma- were significantly lower compared with controls, whereas eicosenoic and eicosatrienoic acids were significantly higher. Feeding CLA increased (P < 0.05) colostrum IgG in sows. Sows fed CLA had higher (P < 0.05) serum leptin, IgG, and lysozyme.

Activation of fatty  desaturase-elongase systems during blastic transformation.</a></h2><p>The fatty  desaturation-elongation ability of human T-lymphocytes during blastic transformation was determined both by gas-liquid chromatography and incubation with radiolabeled precursors. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were activated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and cultured in media supplemented with different fatty acids (18:0, 18:1(n - 9), 18:2(n - 6), 18:3(n - 3) and 20:4(n - 6)) at a final concentration of 30 microM. All the fatty acids added were elongated by activated PBMC and the maximal activity was observed on 20:4(n - 6) (a 25% of conversion to 22:4(n - 6)). Supplementation with stearic  increased the proportion of oleic (from 21.4% to 23.7%) and eicosaenoic (from 3.1% to 5.7%) acids in cellular lipids, indicating the existence of a delta 9-desaturase activity. Supplementation with linoleic and linoleic acids increased slightly the cell content in their more unsaturated derivatives. Direct measurement of desaturase activities was performed by incubating quiescent and activated PBMC with [1-14C]stearic, [1-14C]linoleic and [1-14C] acids. Quiescent cells exhibited a very low delta 9-desaturase and no sign of delta 6-desaturase activity. A moderate and progressive activation of delta 9-, delta 6- and delta 5-desaturases was observed during blastic transformation of human PBMC. Up to 8% of 18:0 was converted to monoenes, 4% and 1.5% of 18:2(n - 6) was converted to trienes and tetraenes, respectively, and 14.5% of 18:3(n - 3) was converted to pentaenes. The maximal relative activities were found after 48 h of PHA-stimulation for delta 9-desaturase (around 90 pmol of 18:0 converted per 10(6) cells in the last 24 h) and at 72 h for delta 6- and delta 5-desaturases (around 75 and 140 pmol of 18:2 and 18:3, respectively, converted per 10(7) cells in the last 24 h). Although these activities are not enough to explain all the changes in fatty  composition of human PBMC during blastic transformation, they may contribute to a more controlled cell phospholipid composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2295805>Short term exposure to cis unsaturated free fatty acids inhibits degranulation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.</a></h2><p>Degranulation of CTL stimulated by alloantigen-bearing target cells is shown to be inhibited by short term exposure to low concentrations of long chain cis unsaturated free fatty acids (FFA), whereas saturated FFA have no effect. The Ag-specific (TCR mediated) stimulation of cloned murine CTL was monitored by changes in intracellular calcium concentrations [( Ca2+]i) using the fluorescence indicator acetoxymethylester of fura-2 and by degranulation as measured by the release of BLT-esterase. Treatment of the CTL cells with any of the physiologically important FFA; oleic (18:1), linoleic (18:2),  (18:3), or arachidonic (20:4) , at concentrations between 1 and 10 microM inhibits the target cell-mediated rise in [Ca2+]i which occurs within seconds of stimulation and the release of BLT-esterase, which occurs over a period of 1 to 3 h. These inhibitory effects are observed within seconds to minutes of FFA addition. Inhibition can be reversed by treating cells with fatty  free BSA and, in agreement with our previous studies, indicates that the effects of FFA are due to physical perturbations of cellular components. To determine the locus of this perturbation, the effect of FFA on the lipid order of CTL plasma membrane was determined using fluorescence polarization of the membrane impermeable probe trimethylammoniumdiphenylhexatriene. Cis unsaturated FFA were found to disorder the lipid acyl chains and the degree of disorder was found to increase with the degree of cis unsaturation. These results, together with the previous studies, suggest that inhibition results from a physical perturbation of plasma membrane lipid order. Moreover, because degranulation requires elevated levels of [Ca2+]i, it is likely that inhibition of degranulation results from a FFA-induced decrease in Ca2+ permeability through the membrane.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23479199>Differential induction of oxylipin pathway in potato and tobacco cells by bacterial and oomycete elicitors.</a></h2><p>Potato and tobacco cells are differentially suited to study oxylipin pathway and elicitor-induced responses. Synthesis of oxylipins via the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway provides plant cells with an important class of signaling molecules, related to plant stress responses and innate . The aim of this study was to evaluate the induction of LOX pathway in tobacco and potato cells induced by a concentrated culture filtrate (CCF) from Phytophthora infestans and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Pectobacterium atrosepticum. Oxylipin activation was evaluated by the measurement of LOX activity and metabolite quantification. The basal levels of oxylipins and fatty acids showed that potato cells contained higher amounts of linoleic (LA),  (LnA) and stearic acids than tobacco cells. The major oxylipin in potato cells, 9(S),10(S),11(R)-trihydroxy-12(Z),15(Z)-octadecadienoic  (9,10,11-THOD), was not detected in tobacco cells. CCF induced a sharp increase of LA and LnA at 8 h in tobacco cells. In contrast they decreased in potato cells. In CCF-treated tobacco cells, colneleic  increased up to 24 h, colnelenic  and 9(S)-hydroxyoctadecatrienoic  (9(S)-HOT) increased up to 16 h. In potato cells, only colneleic  increased slightly until 16 h. A differential induction of LOX activity was measured in both cells treated by CCF. With LPS treatment, only 9,10,11-THOD accumulation was significantly induced at 16 h in potato cells. Fatty acids were constant in tobacco but decreased in potato cells over the studied time period. These results showed that the two elicitors were differently perceived by the two Solanaceae and that oxylipin pathway is strongly induced in tobacco with the CCF. They also revealed that elicitor-induced responses depended on both cell culture and elicitor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/402615>Essential fatty  restriction and turnover of retinal rod discs.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202985>Dihomo-γ- inhibits several key cellular processes associated with atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis and its complications are responsible for one in three global deaths. Nutraceuticals show promise in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis but require an indepth understanding of the mechanisms underlying their actions. A previous study showed that the omega-6 fatty , dihomo-γ- (DGLA), attenuated atherosclerosis in the apolipoprotein E deficient mouse model system. However, the mechanisms underlying such protective effects of DGLA are poorly understood and were therefore investigated. We show that DGLA attenuates chemokine-driven monocytic migration together with foam cell formation and the expression of key pro-atherogenic genes induced by three pro-inflammatory cytokines in human macrophages. The effect of DGLA on interferon-γ signaling was mediated via inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 phosphorylation on serine 727. In relation to anti-foam cell action, DGLA inhibits modified LDL uptake by both macropinocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis, the latter by reduction in expression of two key scavenger receptors (SR-A and CD36), and stimulates cholesterol efflux from foam cells. DGLA also improves macrophage mitochondrial bioenergetic profile by decreasing proton leak. Gamma- and prostaglandin E1, upstream precursor and key metabolite respectively of DGLA, also acted in an anti-atherogenic manner. The actions of DGLA extended to other key atherosclerosis-associated cell types with attenuation of endothelial cell proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells in response to platelet-derived growth factor. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-atherogenic actions of DGLA and supports further assessments on its protective effects on plaque regression in vivo and in human trials.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Host resistance is the most promising way to control the disease. Metabolic profiling was applied to identify resistance related (RR) metabolites against Fusarium graminearum in five FHB-resistant genotypes ('Chevron', 'H5277-44', 'H5277-164', 'M92-513' and 'M122') relative to one FHB-susceptible genotype ('Stander'). The disease severity was assessed in greenhouse to group the genotypes based on FHB-resistance. The disease was quantified as the proportion of diseased spikelets (PSD) and the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). Spikelets were collected at 72 h post inoculation. Metabolites were extracted into an aqueous solution of methanol and analyzed using a LC-hybrid-MS system. Metabolite abundances were subjected to a resistant versus susceptible pair-wise analysis, using a t test. Resistance related (RR) metabolites, both constitutive (RRC) and induced (RRI), were identified amongst metabolites whose levels were significantly higher in resistant genotype than in susceptible. Among 1,430 RR metabolites, 115 were putatively identified. These RR metabolites belonged to different chemical groups: fatty acids: ; phenylpropanoids: p-coumaric, sinapic ; flavonoids: naringenin, kaempferol glucoside, catechol glucoside. In addition, resistance indicator metabolites, such as deoxynivalenol (DON) and DON-3-O-glucoside (D3G) were also detected.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dietary supplementation with moderate levels of ALNA, gamma- (GLA), arachidonic  (ARA), DHA, or FO on inflammatory cell numbers and functions and on circulating levels of soluble adhesion molecules. Healthy subjects aged 55 to 75 yr consumed nine capsules per day for 12 wk. The capsules contained placebo oil (an 80:20 mix of palm and sunflowerseed oils) or blends of placebo oil with oils rich in ALNA, GLA, ARA, or DHA or FO. Subjects in these groups consumed 2 g ALNA; approximately 700 mg GLA, ARA, or DHA; or 1 g EPA plus DHA (720 mg EPA + 280 mg DHA) daily from the capsules. Total fat intake from the capsules was 4 g per day. None of the treatments affected inflammatory cell numbers in the bloodstream; neutrophil and monocyte phagocytosis or respiratory burst in response to E. coli; production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-6 in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide; or plasma concentrations of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1. In contrast, the ALNA and FO treatments decreased the plasma concentrations of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (16 and 28% decrease, respectively) and soluble E-selectin (23 and 17% decrease, respectively). It is concluded that, in contrast to previous reports using higher amounts of these fatty acids, a moderate increase in consumption of long-chain n-6 or n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids does not significantly affect inflammatory cell numbers or neutrophil and monocyte responses in humans and so would not be expected to cause immune impairment. Furthermore, we conclude that moderate levels of ALNA and FO, which could be incorporated into the diet, can decrease some markers of endothelial activation and that this mechanism of action may contribute to the reported health benefits of n-3 fatty acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2162007>[A chance for the prevention of atopic diseases].</a></h2><p>The proposed concept links the alterations in cell-mediated and humoral  in atopy to impaired prostaglandin E (PGE)-mediated thymic maturation of T-suppressor lymphocytes and diminished activation of T-suppressor lymphocytes of the peripheral atopic immune system.

Body weight gain and feed efficiency were optimized when male calves consumed T2, whereas gain by female calves tended to increase linearly with increasing intake of essential FA during the first 30 d of age. However, these responses to treatment were not maintained after initiation of concentrate feeding at 31 d of life. Over the 60-d preweaning period, wither and hip heights were improved in both sexes as intake of essential FA increased up to T3. Some measures of health and  were affected by replacing some coconut oil with soybean oil. Severity of diarrhea tended to decrease linearly; plasma concentrations of haptoglobin during diarrhea were lower in T2, T3, and T4; phagocytosis by blood neutrophils tended to peak for calves fed T2; in vitro proliferation of stimulated blood lymphocytes was greater for calves fed T2; in vitro stimulated blood cells produced more IFN-γ (up to T3 for males and T2 for females), concentrations of serum IgG against ovalbumin injections were increased in males fed T2 or T3; and skin-fold thickness increased in response to an intradermal antigen injection of all calves fed up to T4. Across sex and under the conditions of the present study, mean daily intakes of linoleic  between 3 to 5g/d and intakes of α- between 0.3 and 0.6g/d during the first 30 d of life promoted growth of preweaned Holstein calves, possibly by improving their immune status.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

All fatty acids tested were taken up readily by the cells and both neutral and phospholipid fractions were enriched with the fatty  provided in the medium. This generated a range of cells enriched in saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids, including n-3 acids of fish oil origin. Saturated fatty  enrichment enhanced macrophage adhesion to both tissue culture plastic and bacterial plastic compared with enrichment with polyunsaturated fatty acids. Macrophages enriched with the saturated fatty acids myristate or palmitate showed decreases of 28% and 21% respectively in their ability to phagocytose unopsonized zymosan particles. Those enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids showed 25-55% enhancement of phagocytic capacity. The greatest rate of uptake was with arachidonate-enriched cells. Phagocytic rate was highly correlated with the saturated/unsaturated fatty  ratio, percentage of polyunsaturated fatty  and index of unsaturation, except for macrophages enriched with fish-oil-derived fatty acids; they showed lower phagocytic activity than expected on the basis of their degree of unsaturation. These results suggest that membrane fluidity is important in determining macrophage adhesion and phagocytic activity. However, in the case of phagocytosis, this effect may be partially overcome if the cells are enriched with fish-oil-derived fatty acids. Thus it may be possible to modulate the activity of cells of the immune system, and so an immune response, by dietary lipid manipulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28684322>Dietary arachidonic  affects immune function and fatty  composition in cultured rabbitfish Siganus rivulatus.</a></h2><p>The marbled spinefoot rabbitfish (Siganus rivulatus) is an economically valuable fish species that has potential for commercial production in aquaculture. To overcome challenges in its sustainable production, a formulated diet is required for imparting health and robustness. This study evaluates the effect of dietary supplementation with arachidonic  (ARA; 20:4n-6) on growth, survival, immune function and fatty  composition of red blood cells (RBCs) in rabbitfish. We conducted two feeding trials using juvenile fish (to evaluate growth and survival) and adults (to evaluate immune function and fatty  incorporation). Fish were fed diets supplemented with three different levels of ARA (in % of total fatty acids): 0.6 (unsupplemented control), 2.6 (moderate) and 4.7 (high). The fish fed with moderate ARA levels exhibited improved (p < 0.05) growth over the control and the high ARA level groups. During an outbreak of Streptococcus iniae, fish fed with moderate ARA survived significantly (p < 0.05) better (89%) than the control and the high ARA groups (59% and 48%, respectively). Moderate ARA supplementation resulted in elevated lysozyme and complement levels in the plasma of rabbitfish. A significant increase in the total serum immunoglobulin levels was observed in both the medium and the high ARA level groups; however, a decrease in antiprotease activity was recorded in the supplemented groups as compared to the control. Fatty  analysis in fish red blood cells revealed a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the proportion of ARA of total fatty acids in the groups fed with the medium and the high ARA level diets (9.5% and 11.2%, respectively, compared to 7.1% in the control). Concomitantly, there was a decrease in the proportion of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA; 20:5n-3), dihomo-γ  (DGLA; 20:3n-6) and several 18-carbon unsaturated fatty acids in these groups. In conclusion, ARA in rabbitfish feeds improved growth, survival as well as innate and acquired humoral immune functions. Thus ARA supplementation in the diet of this species could be a valuable step towards establishing the commercial culture of rabbitfish.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this report, we found that YCWE treatment triggered rice cell suspension cultures to accumulate phenylalanine (Phe), cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic  (OPDA), 12-hydroxyjasmonoyle isoleucine (12OHJA-Ile), and azelaic  (AzA). YCWE treatment also reduced endogenous triacylglycerol (TG) content. The addition of C-uniform-labeled oleic, linoleic and  acids to the rice cell suspension cultures gave rise to C-uniform-labeled AzA. It was also found that YCWE treatment for Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in accumulations of OPDA, AzA, Phe, and camalexin together with enhanced resistance against Botrytis cinerea infection. This suggested that YCWE treatment upon plants may activate JA and AzA signaling systems to induce plant disease resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10477037>Dose-dependent effects of dietary gamma- on rat spleen lymphocyte functions.</a></h2><p>Feeding rodents a diet rich in evening primrose oil (EPO), which contains 5-10 g gamma- (GLA)/100 g total fatty acids, has been shown to decrease lymphocyte proliferation and natural killer cell activity. However, EPO contains a very high level of linoleic  which itself can affect lymphocyte functions and it is not clear to what extent the effects of EPO can be attributed to GLA. The current study investigated the effect of two levels of GLA in the rat diet upon immune cell functions; the level of linoleic  was maintained below 30 g/100 g total fatty acids. Weanling rats were fed on high fat (178 g/kg) diets which contained 4.4 g or 10 g GLA/100 g total fatty acids in place of a proportion of linoleic . The total polyunsaturated fatty  content and the n-6 to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  ratio of the diet were maintained at 35 g/100 g total fatty acids and 7, respectively. The fatty  compositions of the serum and of spleen leukocytes were markedly influenced by that of the diet, with an increase in the proportions of GLA and dihomo-gamma- when the diets containing GLA were fed; these diets also increased the proportion of arachidonic  in spleen leukocytes. Spleen lymphocyte proliferation in response to concanavalin A was significantly reduced (by 60%) by feeding the diet containing the higher level of GLA, but not by the diet containing the lower level of GLA. Spleen natural killer cell activity and prostaglandin E (PGE) production by spleen leukocytes were not significantly affected by inclusion of GLA in the diet, although there was a tendency towards decreased natural killer cell activity by cells from rats fed the high GLA diet. Thus, this study shows that dietary GLA is capable of altering the fatty  composition of cells of the immune system and of exerting some immunomodulatory effects, but that the level of GLA in the diet must exceed 4.4 g/100 g total fatty acids for these effects to become apparent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7964168>Dietary polyunsaturated fatty  effects on immune cells of the porcine lung.</a></h2><p>The effects of various dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on the function of immune cells of the porcine lung was studied. Groups of six pigs were fed diets containing 10.5% corn oil [CO; enriched in linoleic  (18:2, n-6)], linseed oil (LO; enriched in  (18:3, n-3)], menhaden oil (MO; enriched in eicosapentaenoic (20:5; n-3) and docosahexaenoic (22:6; n-3) acids], linseed + corn oil (1:1; LC), and menhaden + corn oil (1:1; MC) for 28-30 days. Basal levels of alveolar macrophage (m phi) tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production were higher (P < .05) for LC- and MC-fed pigs than for CO- and LO-fed pigs. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated LC and MC m phi s produced more TNF than m phi s from pigs fed CO, LO, and MO diets. Macrophages from pigs receiving the CO and LC diets had higher (P < .05) levels of leucine aminopeptidase than m phi s from the other dietary groups. Lipopolysaccharide did not increase m phi nitrite production over basal levels except in the MO diet group. However, LPS-stimulated m phi s from the CO, MO, and LC dietary groups produced more nitrite than m phi s from MC-fed pigs. Alveolar lymphocytes from pigs receiving the MC diet produced more T cell growth factors than LO and MO m phi s. Alveolar m phi s from the different dietary groups did not differ in their capacity for non-immune-mediated phagocytosis of fluorescent latex beads. These results indicate that dietary PUFAs can modulate some functions of porcine alveolar immune cells and that this may prove significant for host response to respiratory disease agents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22199234>Role of 9-lipoxygenase and α-dioxygenase oxylipin pathways as modulators of local and systemic defense.</a></h2><p>Plant 9-lipoxygenases (9-LOX) and α-dioxygenases (α-DOX) initiate the synthesis of oxylipins after bacterial infection. Here, the role of these enzymes in plants' defense was investigated using individual Arabidopsis thaliana lox1 and dox1 mutants and a double lox1 dox1 mutant. Studies with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) revealed the enhanced susceptibility of lox1 to the virulent strain Pst DC3000 and the partial impairment of lox1 and dox1 mutants to activate systemic acquired resistance. Notably, both defects were enhanced in the lox1 dox1 plants as compared with individual mutants. We found that pre-treatment with 9-LOX- and α-DOX-generated oxylipins protected plant tissues against bacterial infection. The strongest effect in this respect was exerted by 9-ketooctadecatrienoic  (9-KOT), which is produced from  by 9-LOX. Quantification of 9-KOT revealed its accumulation after bacterial infection. The levels were reduced in lox1 and lox1 dox1 plants but strongly increased in the dox1 mutant due to metabolic interaction of the two pathways. Transcriptional analyses indicated that 9-KOT pre-treatment modifies hormone homeostasis during bacterial infection. The nature of the changes detected suggested that 9-KOT interferes with the hormonal changes caused by bacterial effectors. This notion was substantiated by the finding that 9-KOT failed to reduce the growth of PstDC3000hrpA, a mutant compromised in effector secretion, and of the avirulent strain Pst DC3000 avrRpm1. Further support for the action of the 9-LOX- and α-DOX-oxylipin pathways as modulators of hormone homeostasis was the observation that lox1 dox1 seedlings are hypersensitive to the growth-inhibitory effect of ABA and showed enhanced activation of ABA-inducible marker genes as compared with wild-type plants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11935943>omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, inflammation and .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10947178>Dietary linoleic  divergently affects immune responsiveness of growing layer hens.</a></h2><p>The effects of linoleic (LA)- and  (LNA)-enriched diets on humoral and in vivo cellular immune responses to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-dinitrophenyl (DNP) and Mycobacterium butyricum were studied in growing layer hens. Pullets were fed one of three diets: a control, LA enriched, or LNA enriched. Pullets were assigned to one of three immunization treatments: KLH-DNP, M. butyricum, or PBS. The LA-enriched diet enhanced the antibody response to KLH in pullets immunized with KLH-DNP. On the other hand, the antibody response to M. butyricum in M. butyricum-immunized birds was decreased by feeding an LA-enriched diet. In vitro lymphocyte proliferation in the presence of Concanavalin A was affected by the interaction between diet and immunization. Neither cutaneous hypersensitivity to KLH nor to M. butyricum was affected by the diet. The BW gain before immunization was not affected by the diet, but after immunization, the LA-enriched diet enhanced growth in birds immunized with M. butyricum. Diets had various effects on organ weights. We concluded that dietary linoleic  enrichment of the diet has an antigen-dependent divergent effect on the antibody response. The dietary LNA effect on the antibody response is less pronounced and is opposite to that of the LA effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9335312>Oral administration of unsaturated fatty acids: effects on human peripheral blood T lymphocyte proliferation.</a></h2><p>Oils enriched in certain polyunsaturated fatty acids suppress joint pain and swelling in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.

Oral administration of oils enriched in linoleic , the parent n-6 fatty , and , the parent n-3 fatty , did not influence growth of stimulated cells.

The role of different fatty  families in modulating phagocytosis and oxidative burst is not clear and therefore the influence of 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on these processes was examined. The mouse monocyte/macrophage line P388D1 was cultured in medium supplemented with 2 or 20 micromol/l 18:2n-6 (linoleic ; LA) or 18:3n-3 (; LNA) and fatty  enrichment of the cells was tested after 8 days. The macrophages were activated with phorbol ester in order to promote oxidative burst and intracellular dihydrorhodamine oxidation was determined. To test phagocytosis capacity uptake of fluorescence-labeled Escherichia coli was determined. Activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB was also determined. Cells grown in medium with 20 micromol/l LA contained 2- to 3-fold more n-6 PUFA including 4-fold more arachidonic . Cells grown in medium with 20 micromol/l LNA contained 4-fold more n-3 PUFA. Both LA and LNA enhanced phagocytosis and decreased oxidative burst, with little difference between the fatty acids. NF-kappaB activation at 1 h post-stimulation was not affected by adding LA or LNA to the culture medium. We conclude that the fatty  composition of macrophages influences their ability to phagocytose and mount oxidative burst.Copyright 2007 S.

The effects of consuming novel soybean oils varying in LA:ALA ratios on T cell proliferation and inflammatory responses were assessed in older adults. Eighteen participants (>50 y old) with elevated cholesterol concentrations (3.37-4.14 mmol/L LDL cholesterol) consumed 5 experimental diets in random order for periods of 35 d. Each diet contained 30% of energy as fat, two-thirds of which was high-oleic  soybean oil (HiOleic-SO), soybean oil (SO), low-SFA soybean oil (LoSFA-SO), hydrogenated soybean oil (Hydrog-SO), or low-ALA soybean oil (LoALA-SO), resulting in LA:ALA ratios of 2.98, 8.70, 9.69, 15.2, and 18.3, respectively. Participants had higher proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) compared with baseline following consumption of SO (26%; P < 0.05), LoSFA-SO (22%; P < 0.05), or HiOleic-SO (24%; P < 0.05) diets. Proliferative response was similar to the baseline after participants consumed diets with an LA:ALA ratio >10 (Hydrog-SO and LoALA-SO). Post-diet intervention, LA:ALA ratios correlated with proliferative responses to PHA (r = -0.87; P = 0.05). An optimal proliferative response was observed at an LA:ALA ratio of 8.70, with an inverse correlation between proliferative response and LA:ALA ratios >8.70. These effects were independent of changes in the production of PGE(2), inflammatory cytokines, or cytokines involved in growth of lymphocytes. These data suggest that the LA:ALA ratio modulates the proliferative ability of T lymphocytes, which may be due to subtle changes in fatty  composition of the phospholipids in immune cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19752539>Effects of fat and fatty  intake on inflammatory and immune responses: a critical review.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29407798>Environmentally-realistic concentration of cadmium combined with polyunsaturated fatty acids enriched diets modulated non-specific  in rainbow trout.</a></h2><p>Nutrition is crucial to grow healthy fish particularly in a context of pollution, overcrowding and pathogen risks. Nowadays, the search for food components able to improve fish health is increasingly developing. Here, the influence of four dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that are  (ALA, 18:3n-3), linoleic  (LA, 18:2n-6), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6n-3) on the sensitivity of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) juveniles to environmentally realistic cadmium (Cd, 0.3 μg/L) concentration was investigated. Fish diets were designed to ensure the specific abundance of one of these individual PUFAs, and were given for a 4-week pre-conditioning period followed by a 6-week Cd exposure period. Focus was put on growth performance and immune responses following a short (24 h) and a long-term (6 weeks) Cd exposure. For each experimental condition, some fish were submitted to a bacterial challenge (24 h) with Aeromonas salmonicida achromogenes at the end of Cd conditioning period. DHA-enriched diet improved growth performances as compared to LA-enriched diet, but also increased ROS production (after short-term exposure to Cd) that could lead to a higher inflammation status, and some -related genes (at short and long-term exposure). We notably highlighted the fact that even a low, environmentally-realistic concentration, Cd can strongly impact the immune system of rainbow trout, and that specific dietary PUFA enrichment strategies can improve growth performance (DHA-enriched diet), provide protection against oxidative stress (ALA- and EPA-enriched diet) and stimulate non-specific .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In mammals, the innate immune response in combination with antigen-specific recognition is required for the activation of adaptive . Therefore, innate  is a pharmaceutical target for the development of immune regulators. Here, for the purpose of pharmaceutical screening, we established an in vitro culture based on the innate immune response of Drosophila. The in vitro system is capable of measuring lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-dependent activation of the immune deficiency (imd) pathway, which is similar to the tumour necrosis factor signalling pathway in mammals. Screening revealed that well-known inhibitors of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), dexamethasone (Dex) and p-bromophenacyl bromide (BPB) inhibit LPS-dependent activation of the imd pathway. The inhibitory effects of Dex and BPB were suppressed by the addition of an excess of three (arachidonic , eicosapentaenoic  and gamma-) of the fatty acids so far tested. Arachidonic , however, did not activate the imd pathway when used as the sole agonist. These findings indicate that PLA(2) participates in LPS-dependent activation of the imd pathway via the generation of arachidonic  and other mediators, but requires additional signalling from LPS stimulation. Moreover, PLA(2) was activated in response to bacterial infection in Sarcophaga. These results suggest a functional link between the PLA(2)-generated fatty  cascade and the LPS-stimulated imd pathway in insect .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19023415>Gamma- and stearidonic acids are required for basal  in Caenorhabditis elegans through their effects on p38 MAP kinase activity.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) form a class of essential micronutrients that play a vital role in development, cardiovascular health, and . The influence of lipids on the immune response is both complex and diverse, with multiple studies pointing to the beneficial effects of long-chain fatty acids in . However, the mechanisms through which PUFAs modulate innate  and the effects of PUFA deficiencies on innate immune functions remain to be clarified. Using the Caenorhabditis elegans-Pseudomonas aeruginosa host-pathogen system, we present genetic evidence that a Delta6-desaturase FAT-3, through its two 18-carbon products--gamma- (GLA, 18:3n6) and stearidonic  (SDA, 18:4n3), but not the 20-carbon PUFAs arachidonic  (AA, 20:4n6) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20:5n3)--is required for basal innate  in vivo. Deficiencies in GLA and SDA result in increased susceptibility to bacterial infection, which is associated with reduced basal expression of a number of immune-specific genes--including spp-1, lys-7, and lys-2--that encode antimicrobial peptides. GLA and SDA are required to maintain basal activity of the p38 MAP kinase pathway, which plays important roles in protecting metazoan animals from infections and oxidative stress. Transcriptional and functional analyses of fat-3-regulated genes revealed that fat-3 is required in the intestine to regulate the expression of infection- and stress-response genes, and that distinct sets of genes are specifically required for immune function and oxidative stress response. Our study thus uncovers a mechanism by which these 18-carbon PUFAs affect basal innate immune function and, consequently, the ability of an organism to defend itself against bacterial infections. The conservation of p38 MAP kinase signaling in both stress and immune responses further encourages exploring the function of GLA and SDA in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11469650>Interactions and antigen dependence of dietary n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids on antibody responsiveness in growing layer hens.</a></h2><p>Effects of four levels of dietary linoleic  (LA), an n-6 fatty , and four levels of  (LNA), an n-3 fatty , and their interactions on immune responses in growing layer hens were studied. Immune responses were induced by injection with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) or Mycobacterium butyricum particles at 35 d of age. Antibody (Ab) responses were measured until 21 d after immunization. In addition, delayed-type hypersensitivity, lymphocyte proliferation, weekly feed intake, and BW gain were studied. At Day 7 after immunization, anti-M. butyricum titers in the M. butyricum-immunized hens were decreased by the increase of dietary LA (P < 0.05). In the period from 10 to 14 d after immunization, anti-KLH Ab titers in KLH-immunized animals were affected by the interaction of dietary LA with LNA (P < 0.01). High dietary levels of LA or LNA increased the anti-KLH Ab response. However, at high levels of dietary LA and LNA, anti-KLH Ab titers were not increased. In the same period, anti-M. butyricum Ab titers of M. butyricum-immunized hens were affected by the interaction of dietary LA with LNA (P < 0.05). At low levels of LA and LNA, increased LA levels decreased the Ab response, whereas increased LNA levels at low LA levels hardly affected the anti-M. butyricum response. At a high level of LA, increased dietary LNA increased the anti-M. butyricum response. In vitro proliferation of peripheral blood leukocytes after stimulation with concanavalin A (ConA) was higher in chickens with a high level of dietary LNA. Feed intake decreased when the dietary levels of LA or LNA increased. However, BW gain was not affected by dietary treatments. Feed conversion was more efficient in birds fed high levels of LA and LNA. The present study indicates that various factors affect the Ab responses. First, the interaction of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is more important than the separate effects of n-3 or n-6. Second, the actions of dietary PUFA were different between antigens of a different nature. Third was the nature of the antigen affects when dietary PUFA exert their actions and the persistence of these effects. The presence of these multiple factors affecting immune responses should be considered when comparing effects of dietary PUFA on immune responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1830070>Arachidonic  is essential for IgG Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis by human monocytes.</a></h2><p>Phagocytosis is a specialized function of neutrophils and macrophages that requires coordination of multiple biochemical and biophysical events. Considerable progress has been made in identifying the membrane receptors involved in phagocytosis, but the intracellular signaling pathways that are necessary for particle ingestion are poorly understood. In an effort to address this complex question, we investigated the role of arachidonic  (AA) in the uptake of yeast and IgG-coated E (EIgG) or C-coated E. Human monocytes, labeled with 3H AA, released this label during phagocytosis of yeast and EIgG, but not in response to EC3b. The PL inhibitors bromophenacyl bromide and manoalide abolished the release of 3H and inhibited phagocytosis of EIgG in parallel. Both drugs caused a similar inhibition of yeast-mediated 3H release but had little effect on yeast ingestion. Similar results were obtained with the inhibitor quinacrine (mepacrine). Exogenously added AA and dihomo-gamma- restored bromophenacyl bromide-inhibited EIgG ingestion; arachidonate analogs eicosatrienoic  and eicosapentanoic  did not. Inhibition of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways for AA metabolism by indomethacin or BW755C did not affect EIgG phagocytosis, demonstrating that these major AA metabolic pathways are not involved in phagocytic signaling. These experiments suggest that release of AA is essential for EIgG ingestion and that phagocytosis in monocytes proceeds by at least two mechanisms, one dependent on AA (EIgG) and one independent of it (yeast).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19649246>Punicic  a conjugated  inhibits TNFalpha-induced neutrophil hyperactivation and protects from experimental colon inflammation in rats.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils play a major role in inflammation by releasing large amounts of ROS produced by NADPH-oxidase and myeloperoxidase (MPO). The proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha primes ROS production through phosphorylation of the NADPH-oxidase subunit p47phox on Ser345. Conventional anti-inflammatory therapies remain partially successful and may have side effects. Therefore, regulation of neutrophil activation by natural dietary components represents an alternative therapeutic strategy in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of punicic , a conjugated  fatty  from pomegranate seed oil on TNFalpha-induced neutrophil hyperactivation in vitro and on colon inflammation in vivo.We analyzed the effect of punicic  on TNFalpha-induced neutrophil upregulation of ROS production in vitro and on TNBS-induced rat colon inflammation. Results show that punicic  inhibited TNFalpha-induced priming of ROS production in vitro while preserving formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)-induced response. This effect was mediated by the inhibition of Ser345-p47phox phosphorylation and upstream kinase p38MAPK. Punicic  also inhibited fMLP- and TNFalpha+fMLP-induced MPO extracellular release from neutrophils. In vivo experiments showed that punicic  and pomegranate seed oil intake decreased neutrophil-activation and ROS/MPO-mediated tissue damage as measured by F2-isoprostane release and protected rats from TNBS-induced colon inflammation.These data show that punicic  exerts a potent anti-inflammatory effect through inhibition of TNFalpha-induced priming of NADPH oxidase by targeting the p38MAPKinase/Ser345-p47phox-axis and MPO release. This natural dietary compound may provide a novel alternative therapeutic strategy in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17879998>Molecular mechanisms of the effects of olive oil and other dietary lipids on cancer.</a></h2><p>Cancer is one of the main causes of mortality worldwide.

Epidemiologic and experimental studies have found a role of dietary lipids in cancer, particularly breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers. Their incidence in the Mediterranean countries, where the main source of fat is olive oil, is lower than in other areas of the world. Human studies about the effects of dietary lipids are little conclusive, probably due to methodological issues. On the other hand, experimental data have clearly demonstrated that the influence of dietary fats on cancer depends on the quantity and the type of lipids. Whereas a high intake of n-6 PUFA and saturated fat has tumor-enhancing effects, n-3 PUFA, conjugated linoleic  and gamma- have inhibitory effects. Data regarding MUFA have not always been conclusive, but high olive oil diets seem to have protective effects. Such effects can be due to oleic , the main MUFA in olive oil, and to certain minor compounds such as squalene and phenolic compounds. This work aims to review the current knowledge about the relationship between dietary lipids and cancer, with a special emphasis on olive oil, and the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects: modifications on the carcinogenesis stages, hormonal status, cell membrane structure and function, signal transduction pathways, gene expression, and immune system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2948662>Stimulation of prostaglandin-dependent macrophage suppressor cells by the subcutaneous injection of polyunsaturated fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), in the form of pure linoleic, , or arachidonic , were injected subcutaneously into male C57Bl/6 mice daily for 10 days. Injection of 3.6 mg/day of PUFA resulted in up to a two- to threefold increase in spleen weight. Spleen cell response to mitogens was reduced by about 70%; mixed lymphocyte responses were reduced by about 90% when compared to normal values. In admixture experiments, spleen cells from PUFA treated mice suppressed the mitogen induced blastogenic response of control spleen cells by up to 90%. Fractionation of spleen cells from PUFA treated mice by G-10 adherence resulted in an enrichment of suppressive activity in the adherent cells. The suppressive effect of G-10 adherent cells was abolished by the addition of indomethacin as well as by depletion of macrophages by treatments with agents such as carbonyl iron and leucine methyl ester. These studies indicate that the administration of PUFA has marked immunosuppressive effects in mice. These effects may be related to increased prostaglandin production and appear to be mediated by a macrophage type cell.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23810586>Intake of specific fatty acids and fat alters growth, health, and titers following vaccination in dairy calves.</a></h2><p>Typical fatty  profiles of milk and milk replacer (MR) differ. Calf MR in the United States are made from animal fat, which are low in short- and medium-chain fatty acids and . Two 56-d trials compared a control MR containing 27% crude protein and formulated with 3 fat and fatty  compositions. The 3 MR treatments were (1) only animal fat totaling 17% fat (CON), (2) animal fat supplemented with butyrate, medium-chain fatty acids, and  using a commercial product (1.25% NeoTec4 MR; Provimi North America, Brookville, OH) totaling 17% fat (fatty -supplemented; FA-S), and (3) milk fat totaling 33% fat (MF). The MR were fed at 660 g of dry matter from d 0 to 42 and weaned. Starter (20% crude protein) and water were fed ad libitum for 56 d. Trial 1 utilized Holstein calves (24 female, 24 male) during summer months and trial 2 utilized Holstein calves (48 male) during fall months. Calves (41±1 kg of initial body weight; 2 to 3d of age) were sourced from a single farm and housed in a naturally ventilated nursery without added heat. Calves were in individual pens with straw bedding. Calf was the experimental unit. Data for each trial were analyzed as a completely randomized design with a 3 (MR treatment) × 2 (sex) factorial arrangement of treatments in trial 1 with repeated measures and as a completely randomized design with 3 MR treatments in trial 2 with repeated measures. Preplanned contrast statements of treatments CON versus FA-S and CON versus MF were used to separate means. We found no interactions of MR treatment by sex. Calf average daily gain, hip width change, and feed efficiency differed (CON<FA-S; CON<MF). Days with abnormal fecal scores differed (CON>FA-S). Titers to bovine respiratory parainfluenza-3 and bovine virus diarrhea type 1 (vaccinations to these pathogens were on d 7 and 28) in serum samples taken on d 49 and 56 differed (CON<FA-S). Average and daily maximum skin tail temperatures based on automated measurements taken every 10 min differed (CON>FA-S; CON<MF). Concentrations of urea nitrogen and glucose in serum samples taken on d 7, 21, and 28 differed (CON>FA-S; CON>MF).

Both the activity of glutathione peroxidase and catalase in serum and milk in oil groups were decreased, which were negatively correlated with the levels of cis-9, trans-11 CLA and ALA. The concentrations of proinflammatory factors (TNF-α and INF-γ) in serum of oil groups were lower than that from the CON cows.These results indicate that diet supplementation with rubber seed oil or flaxseed oil could alter serum fatty  profile and enhance the immune function of dairy cows. However, the negative effect on milk oxidation stability should be considered when feeding these n-3 PUFA-enriched oils in dairy production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30053299>Effect of fungal gamma- and beta-carotene containing prefermented feed on  and gut of broiler chicken.</a></h2><p>Gamma- (GLA) is a fatty  from the ω-6 family. It is able to deliver a wide range of health benefits arising from its anti-inflammatory effects. An insufficient supply of GLA from agricultural and animal sources resulted in the development of a fermentation technique using lower filamentous fungi, which have the ability to accumulate high concentrations of GLA and beta-carotene during solid-state fermentation of cereals. The goal of this study was to observe the influence of the addition of prefermented cereal product, containing high amounts of GLA and beta-carotene, into the feed of broiler chickens on their immune status, and also the number of lactic  bacteria and enterobacteria in gut content, which has never been studied before. Immunostimulation in the GLA group was manifested by a significant increase in the oxidative burst of phagocytes, CD4+CD8- lymphocytes in blood, and the CD4: CD8 ratio. Upregulation of gene expression for IgA in the GLA group indicates that the B-lymphocytes were stimulated at a local gut level. In the caecum, increased mRNA expression for mucin-2 and insulin-like growth factor was observed in the GLA group, which could contribute mainly to the protection of the intestinal mucosa and to better growth and regeneration of skeletal muscles. Improved immune activation and protection of the intestinal mucosa were subsequently reflected in a change of the microbial composition in gut contents; a significant reduction of enterobacteria occurred after GLA administration. We can conclude that prefermented cereals containing fungal GLA and beta-carotene represent a low-cost supplement for broiler diet having a beneficial health effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14641966>The effect of feeding structured triacylglycerols enriched in eicosapentaenoic or docosahexaenoic acids on murine splenocyte fatty  composition and leucocyte phagocytosis.</a></h2><p>The effects of altering the type of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) in the mouse diet on the ability of monocytes and neutrophils to perform phagocytosis were investigated. Male weanling mice were fed for 7 d on one of nine diets which contained 178 g lipid/kg and which differed in the type of n-3 PUFA and in the position of these in dietary triacylglycerol (TAG). The control diet contained 4.4 g /100 g total fatty acids. In the other diets, eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) or docosahexaenoic  (DHA) replaced a proportion (50 or 100 %) of the , and were in the sn-2 or the sn-1(3) position of dietary TAG. There were significant increases in the content of n-3 PUFA in spleen-cell phospholipids when EPA or DHA was fed. These increases were largely independent of the position of EPA or DHA in dietary TAG except when EPA was fed at the highest level, when the incorporation was greater when it was fed in the sn-2 than in the sn-1(3) position. There was no significant effect of dietary DHA on monocyte or neutrophil phagocytic activity. Dietary EPA dose-dependently decreased the number of monocytes and neutrophils performing phagocytosis. However, when EPA was fed in the sn-2 position, the ability of active monocytes or neutrophils to engulf bacteria was increased in a dose-dependent fashion. This did not occur when EPA was fed in the sn-1(3) position. Thus, there appears to be an influence of the position of EPA, but not of DHA, in dietary TAG on its incorporation into cell phospholipids and on the activity of phagocytic cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24064233>Dietary Hizikia fusiformis glycoprotein-induced IGF-I and IGFBP-3 associated to somatic growth, polyunsaturated fatty  metabolism, and  in juvenile olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus.</a></h2><p>This study was aimed to examine the effect of dietary glycoprotein extracted from the sea mustard Hizikia fusiformis (Phaeophyceae: Sargassaceae) as a dietary supplement on growth performance in association with somatotropin level, proximate compositions, and  in juvenile olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus. Water-ethanol extracted glycoprotein from H. fusiformis was supplemented to three fishmeal-based diets at the concentration of 0, 5, and 10gkg(-1) diet (designated as H0, H5, and H10, respectively). After a 12week-long feeding trial, growth performance and biochemical responses were analyzed including proximate composition, and whole body amino acids and fatty acids. We also measured plasma insulin like growth factor (IGF), IGF-binding protein (IGFBP) and interleukin (IL). The fish fed H5 showed the greatest weight gain among the dietary treatments. In parallel with the growth, the fish fed the diets containing H. fusiformis glycoprotein showed an increased plasma IGF-I activity and increased expression of 43-kDa IGFBP-3 compared to that in the control, whereas an opposite trend was observed for 34-kDa IGFBP-1. Although no differences were found in the level of whole body linoleic  (C18:2n-6) and  (C18:3n-3) among treatments, increases in arachidonic  (ARA, C20:4n-6), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, C20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C22:6n-3) were observed in fish fed H5 compared to control. IL-2 and -6 levels increased significantly in fish fed H10 compared to those in the control indicating increased .

Both mitogen (ConA)-induced proliferative lymphocyte responsiveness during 4 days of culture and eicosanoid (prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4))) production during 36 h were determined in relation to the absence or presence of various concentrations of LA and LNA (0, 1, 5, 25, 125 and 250 microM). Mitogen-driven proliferative responses of lymphocytes tended to be uninfluenced in the presence of lower concentrations of LA, whereas significant inhibition was observed at the higher concentrations of LA (125 and 250 microM). However, increasing amounts of LNA did not affect the proliferation. ConA stimulation induced a clear PGE(2) response, which significantly decreased in the presence of 250 microM of LA. In addition, increasing amounts of LNA, but not LA, led to a significant decrease in LTB(4) levels. However, The production of LTB(4) did not alter due to mitogenic stimulation. In conclusion, the present study shows that bovine mononuclear cells may functionally be influenced by the presence of PUFA in their environment. Further studies need to be conducted to clarify in vivo consequences of these findings in a situation of PUFA enriched rations in ruminants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10471124>Human peripheral blood T lymphocyte proliferation after activation of the T cell receptor: effects of unsaturated fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Oils enriched in certain polyunsaturated fatty acids suppress joint pain and swelling in rheumatoid arthritis patients with active synovitis. Because T lymphocyte activation is important for propagation of joint tissue injury in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, we examined the effects of fatty acids added in vitro on proliferation of human T lymphocytes stimulated with monoclonal antibodies to CD3 and CD4. Unsaturated fatty acids reduced T cell proliferation in a dose dependent manner (dihomogammalinolenic  > gammalinolenic  > eicosapentaenoic  > arachidonic ). Removal of fatty acids from cultures before cell stimulation did not change the effects, but addition of fatty acids after cell stimulation failed to reduce T cell responses. The saturated palmitic  did not influence T cell growth. These studies indicate that small changes in cellular fatty acids can have profound effects on early events in T cell signaling and on T cell function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23370715>Defense activated by 9-lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins requires specific mitochondrial proteins.</a></h2><p>9-Lipoxygenases (9-LOXs) initiate fatty  oxygenation, resulting in the formation of oxylipins activating plant defense against hemibiotrophic pathogenic bacteria. Previous studies using nonresponding to oxylipins (noxy), a series of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants insensitive to the 9-LOX product 9-hydroxy-10,12,15-octadecatrienoic  (9-HOT), have demonstrated the importance of cell wall modifications as a component of 9-LOX-induced defense. Here, we show that a majority (71%) of 41 studied noxy mutants have an added insensitivity to isoxaben, an herbicide inhibiting cellulose synthesis and altering the cell wall. The specific mutants noxy2, noxy15, and noxy38, insensitive to both 9-HOT and isoxaben, displayed enhanced susceptibility to Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 as well as reduced activation of salicylic -responding genes. Map-based cloning identified the mutation in noxy2 as At5g11630 encoding an uncharacterized mitochondrial protein, designated NOXY2. Moreover, noxy15 and noxy38 were mapped at the DYNAMIN RELATED PROTEIN3A and FRIENDLY MITOCHONDRIA loci, respectively. Fluorescence microscopy and molecular analyses revealed that the three noxy mutants characterized exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction and that 9-HOT added to wild-type Arabidopsis causes mitochondrial aggregation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. The results suggest that the defensive responses and cell wall modifications caused by 9-HOT are under mitochondrial retrograde control and that mitochondria play a fundamental role in innate  signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19803380>[Novel type of antimicrobial mechanism in host macrophages against mycobacterial infections].</a></h2><p>Macrophages (M(phi)s) play a central role as anti-microbial effector cells in the expression of host resistance to mycobacterial infections. With respect to antimicrobial effector molecules of host M(phi) against mycobacterial pathogens, recent studies suggest the possibility that the reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI)--and reactive oxygen intermediates-independent antimycobacterial mechanism(s) may be crucial for the antimycobacterial function of host M(phi). In this context, we previously found that free fatty acids (FFAs) such as arachidonic  (AA) and  exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against mycobacterial organisms, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). In addition, FFAs in combination with RNI played critical roles in manifestation of the activity of M(phi) against mycobacterial organisms. Moreover, our recent studies have shown the following findings. First, anti-MTB activity of IFN-gamma-activated M(phi)s was specifically blocked by arachidonyl trifluoromethylketone (aTFMK), an inhibitor of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). Second, ATP potentiated the anti-MAC bactericidal activity of M(phi)s cultivated in the presence of clarithromycin and rifamycin. This effect of ATP was closely related to intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and was specifically blocked by aTFMK. Third, intramacrophage translocation of membranous AA molecules to MAC-containing phagosomes was also specifically blocked by aTFMK. In the confocal microscopic observation of MAC-infected M(phi)s, ATP enhanced the intracellular translocation of cPLA2 into MAC-containing phagosomes. These findings suggest that FFAs (especially AA) produced by the enzymatic action of cPLA2 play important roles as antimycobacterial effectors in the expression of M(phi) antimicrobial activity against mycobacterial pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25369450>A metabolic profiling strategy for the dissection of plant defense against fungal pathogens.</a></h2><p>Here we present a metabolic profiling strategy employing direct infusion Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for the monitoring of soybean's (Glycine max L.) global metabolism regulation in response to Rhizoctonia solani infection in a time-course. Key elements in the approach are the construction of a comprehensive metabolite library for soybean, which accelerates the steps of metabolite identification and biological interpretation of results, and bioinformatics tools for the visualization and analysis of its metabolome. The study of metabolic networks revealed that infection results in the mobilization of carbohydrates, disturbance of the amino  pool, and activation of isoflavonoid, α-linolenate, and phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways of the plant. Components of these pathways include phytoalexins, coumarins, flavonoids, signaling molecules, and hormones, many of which exhibit antioxidant properties and bioactivity helping the plant to counterattack the pathogen's invasion. Unraveling the biochemical mechanism operating during soybean-Rhizoctonia interaction, in addition to its significance towards the understanding of the plant's metabolism regulation under biotic stress, provides valuable insights with potential for applications in biotechnology, crop breeding, and agrochemical and food industries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10692004>Encapsulated fish oil enriched in alpha-tocopherol alters plasma phospholipid and mononuclear cell fatty  compositions but not mononuclear cell functions.</a></h2><p>Several studies have reported that dietary fish oil (FO) supplementation alters cytokine production and other functional activities of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). However, few of these studies have been placebo controlled and few have related the functional changes to alterations in PBMC fatty  compositionHealthy subjects supplemented their diets with 9 g day-1 of encapsulated placebo oil (3 : 1 mix of coconut and soybean oils), olive oil (OO), safflower oil (SO), evening primrose oil (EPO) or FO [providing 2.1 g eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) plus 1.1 g docosahexaenoic  (DHA) per day] for 12 weeks; the capsules also provided 205 mg alpha-tocopherol per day. Blood was sampled at 4-weekly intervals and plasma and PBMC prepared. Plasma phospholipid and PBMC fatty  composition, plasma alpha-tocopherol and thiobarbituric -reactive substance concentrations, plasma total antioxidant capacity, the proportions of different PBMC subsets, the proportions of PBMC expressing the adhesion molecules CD2, CD11b and CD54, and PBMC functions (lymphocyte proliferation, natural killer cell activity, cytokine production) were measured. All measurements were repeated after a 'washout' period of 8 weeks.The placebo, OO and SO capsules had no effect on plasma phospholipid or PBMC fatty  composition. The proportion of dihomo-gamma- in plasma phospholipids was elevated in subjects taking EPO and was decreased in subjects taking FO. There was no appearance of gamma- in the plasma phospholipids or PBMC in subjects taking EPO. There was a marked increase in the proportion of EPA in the plasma phospholipids (10-fold) and PBMC (four-fold) of subjects taking FO supplements; this increase was maximal after 4 weeks of supplementation. There was an increase in the proportion of DHA in plasma phospholipids and PBMC, and an approximately 20% decrease in the proportion of arachidonic  in plasma phospholipids and PBMC, during FO supplementation. Plasma concentrations of alpha-tocopherol were significantly elevated during supplementation in all subjects and returned to baseline values after the washout period. There were no effects of supplementation with any of the capsules on total plasma antioxidant activity or plasma thiobarbituric -reactive substances or on the proportion of different PBMC subsets, on the proportion of PBMC expressing adhesion molecules, on natural killer cell activity, on the proliferation of mitogen-stimulated whole blood cultures or PBMC, or on the ex vivo production of a range of cytokines by whole blood cultures or PBMC cultures stimulated by either concanavalin A or lipopolysaccharide.Supplementation of the diet with 3.2 g EPA plus DHA per day markedly alters plasma phospholipid and PBMC fatty  compositions. The lack of effect of FO upon PBMC functions may relate to the level of alpha-tocopherol included in the supplements.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3748386>Dietary essential fatty acids, vitamin E, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.</a></h2><p>Twenty patients with type I Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease received dietary supplementation with the essential fatty acids (EFA), linoleic and gamma- acids, and vitamin E.

Chromatograms of macrophages which were grown in the presence of a variety of fatty acids demonstrated that exogenously supplied unsaturated fatty acids (palmitoleic, oleic, elaidic, linoleic,  and arachidonic acids) were readily incorporated into the cells and selectively altered the fatty acyl composition of macrophage phospholipids. Up to 38% of the total cellular phospholipids were found to be derived from the exogenously added fatty  supplements. The incorporation of the different fatty acids into cellular phospholipids had striking effects on cellular phagocytic activity. These effects were found to correlate with the degree of unsaturation, and the cis- or trans-double bond configuration. Thus, macrophage phagocytic ingestion rates of 125I-labelled Shigella flexneri were found to alter by more than 2-fold after the cells were cultivated in the presence of cis unsaturated fatty acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16627889>Breast milk fatty acids may link innate and adaptive immune regulation: analysis of soluble CD14, prostaglandin E2, and fatty acids.</a></h2><p>In addition to its role in sensing intraluminal microbial antigens, soluble (s)CD14 may regulate immune responses by its lesser known function as a lipid carrier with possible influences in the production of fatty -derived eicosanoids. We investigated the interrelations of fatty acids, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and sCD14 and their role in infant atopic eczema during the first year of life. Serum and breast milk samples from mothers and serum samples from their infants were collected at infant's age 3 mo and analyzed for sCD14 and PGE2 concentrations and for fatty  compositions. The main correlation of sCD14 was with arachidonic  (20:4n-6) (AA). Dihomo-gamma- (20:3n-6) (DHGLA) and the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids correlated positively and docosahexaenoic  (22:6n-3) (DHA) and sum of n-3 fatty  negatively with PGE2 in mother's serum and linoleic  (LA) negatively with PGE2 in breast milk. Soluble CD14 tended to be higher and LA, total polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), and sum of n-6 fatty acids were lower in breast milk received by infants with atopic eczema compared with those without. These results suggest that fatty acids contribute to the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses and link intraluminal exposures, mother's diet, and microbes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7463466>Sensitivity of staphylococci to fatty acids: novel inactivation of  by serum.</a></h2><p>The inhibition of coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus of human or animal origin by most free fatty acids was similar, but coagulase-positive staphylococci were sensitive and coagulase-negative cultures were resistant to .

Lecithin-bound iodine (LBI), which has been used as a therapeutic modality for patients with bronchial asthma (BA), effectively inhibited Dermatophagoides farinae (Df) mite antigen-induced IL-2 responsiveness in concentrations comparable to LBI concentrations in blood. IL-2-responding T cells were more sensitive to LBI than antigen-presenting cells, whereas LBI suppressed the release of interleukin 1 (IL-1) elicited by Df antigen. In addition, ovalbumin (OVA)-induced IL-2 responsiveness in egg sensitive patients and purified protein-derivative (PPD)-induced IL-2 responsiveness were similarly inhibited by LBI. The IL-2 responsiveness induced by concanavalin A (Con A), however, was not changed. On the basis of these results, LBI may act as a slight immunosuppressant to inhibit the induction of allergen-specific lymphocytes and to improve the clinical status in allergic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25151821>Lipids as markers of induced resistance in wheat: a biochemical and molecular approach.</a></h2><p>Our work aimed at a global investigation of the lipid metabolism during the induction of resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum) against powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici). More specifically, the effect of salicylic , known as playing a key role in the activation of defence reactions against pathogens in plants, has been investigated. After salicylic  infiltration, accumulation of phosphatidic  was observed that could be due to the phospholipase C pathway since an up-regulation of a phospholipase C-encoding gene expression as well as an accumulation of diacylglycerol were observed. The phosphatidic  accumulation could also result from the phospholipase D pathway since a reduction of phosphatidylethanolamine content occurred. The response to salicylic  at the octadecanoid pathway level was also investigated: both a lipoxygenase-encoding gene expression and lipoxygenase enzymatic activity were induced by salicylic  simultaneously with a decrease of the  content. Finally, a lipid transfer protein-encoding gene expression was also up-regulated upon salicylic  infiltration. These observations indicate that lipid metabolism could be considered as a marker of elicitation in wheat.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24410960>The 9-lipoxygenase Osr9-LOX1 interacts with the 13-lipoxygenase-mediated pathway to regulate resistance to chewing and piercing-sucking herbivores in rice.</a></h2><p>Oxylipins produced by the 13-lipoxygenase (LOX) have been reported to play an important role in plant defense responses to herbivores. Yet, the role of oxylipins produced by the 9-LOX pathway in this process remains largely unknown. Here we cloned a gene encoding a chloroplast-localized 9-LOX, Osr9-LOX1, from rice. Transcriptional analysis revealed that herbivore infestation, mechanical wounding and jasmonic  (JA) treatment either repressed or did not enhance the level of Osr9-LOX1 transcripts at early stages but did at later stages, whereas salicylic  (SA) treatment quickly increased the transcript level of Osr9-LOX1. Antisense expression of Osr9-lox1 (as-r9lox1) decreased the amount of wound-induced (Z)-3-hexenal but increased levels of striped stem borer (SSB)-induced , JA, SA and trypsin protease inhibitors. These changes were associated with increased resistance in rice to the larvae of the SSB Chilo suppressalis. In contrast, although no significant differences were observed in the duration of the nymph stage or the number of eggs laid by female adults between the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens that fed on as-r9lox1 lines and BPH that fed on wild-type (WT) rice plants, the survival rate of BPH nymphs that fed on as-r9lox1 lines was higher than that of nymphs that fed on WT plants, possibly because of a higher JA level. The results demonstrate that Osr9-LOX1 plays an important role in regulating an herbivore-induced JA burst and cross-talk between JA and SA, and in controlling resistance in rice to chewing and phloem-feeding herbivores.© 2014 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30744351>The impact of dietary linseed oil and pomegranate peel extract on broiler growth, carcass traits, serum lipid profile, and meat fatty , phenol, and flavonoid contents.</a></h2><p>The current study aimed to replace soybean oil in broiler diets with linseed oil, which is rich in omega-3 fatty  supplemented with pomegranate peel extract (PPE) and measured its effect on broiler performance, carcass traits, lipid profile, as well as fatty acids composition, phenols and flavonoids content of broiler muscles and  of broiler chicks.A total of 300 1-day-old Cobb chicks were randomly allotted into six experimental groups, T1 fed on basal diet with soybean oil without any additives, T2 fed on basal diet with soybean oil with addition of 0.5 g/kg diet PPE, T3 fed on fed on basal diet with soybean oil with addition of 1 g/kg diet PPE, T4 fed on basal diet with linseed oil without any additives, T5 fed on basal diet with linseed oil with addition of 0.5 g/kg diet PPE and T6 fed on basal diet with linseed oil with addition of 1 g/kg diet PPE. The PPE supplementation with 0.05% improved final body weight with either soybean oil ration or linseed oil ration.The PPE improved carcass dressing percentage in comparison with the control groups. Body fat levels decreased with increasing PPE levels, especially with a linseed oil diet. Replacing soybean oil with linseed oil decreased the total cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels in broiler serum.

Feeding rodents diets rich in fish oil has been shown to decrease lymphocyte proliferation and natural killer cell activity. It is not known what level of EPA + DHA is required in the diet to exert these effects. This question was addressed in the current study. Weanling rats were fed on high fat (178 g/kg) diets which contained 4.4 g  (control) or 4.4 g EPA + DHA (4.4 EPA + DHA) or 6.6 g EPA + DHA (6.6 EPA + DHA)/100 g total fatty acids. The n-6 to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  ratio was maintained at approximately 7. The fatty  compositions of the serum and of spleen leukocytes were markedly influenced by that of the diet. Spleen lymphocyte proliferation in response to concanavalin A, spleen natural killer cell activity and PGE2 production by spleen leukocytes were reduced by feeding the EPA + DHA diets compared with feeding the control diet; the 4.4 and 6.6 EPA + DHA diets caused very similar reductions. The 4.4 EPA + DHA diet reduced popliteal lymph node weight following a localised graft versus host response; this response was not investigated in rats fed the 6.6 EPA + DHA diet. The reductions in lymphocyte functions and in the in vivo graft versus host response caused by the EPA + DHA diets were similar to those previously reported following the feeding of diets rich in fish oil. Thus, this study shows that diets containing relatively low levels of EPA + DHA (20 to 25% of the level found in fish oil) exert immunomodulatory effects. Furthermore, this study suggests that the maximal effect of EPA + DHA is exerted when these fatty acids constitute a level of less than or equal to 4.4 g/100 g total dietary fatty acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29235833>Purification and properties of lipoxygenase from wheat seedlings infected by Fusarium graminearum and treated by salicylic .</a></h2><p>Lipoxygenase from wheat seedlings in normal conditions, infected by Fusarium graminearum and treated by salicylic  was isolated. The isolated enzyme was purified by the methods of salting-out (60% ammonium sulphate), dialysis, gel-filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. Specific activity of the purified enzyme was 8.0-12.5 ΔЕ234/mg of protein, degree of purification – 11.6-15.3 times. The enzyme yield was 18.3-27.9%. Molecular mass of lipoxygenase is 90 kDa, amino  composition is distinguished by a high content of glutamic , proline, valine, isoleucine, leucine and low level of histidine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, cystein. Research of lipoxygenase substrate dependence indicated that the enzyme catalysed with the maximum velocity of the reaction of arachidonic  oxidation at a substrate concentration of 4.5 mM at pH 7.2, the reaction of linoleic  oxidation at a substrate concentration of 4.5 mM at pH 7.2 and the reaction of  oxidation at a substrate concentration of 9.0 mM at pH 8.0. The change of wheat lipoxygenase activity depending on genotype resistance to Fusarium graminearum and millieu of germination was shown. One of the manifestations of the protective effect of salicylic  is its ability to induce changes of lipoxygenase activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10998053>Characterization of RCI-1, a chloroplastic rice lipoxygenase whose synthesis is induced by chemical plant resistance activators.</a></h2><p>A full-length lipoxygenase cDNA (RCI-1) has been cloned from rice (Oryza sativa) whose corresponding transcripts accumulate in response to treatment of the plants with chemical inducers of acquired resistance such as benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carbothioic  S-methyl ester (BTH), 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic  (INA), and probenazole. In contrast, RCI-1 transcript levels did not increase after inoculation with compatible and incompatible races of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea and the nonhost pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. RCI-1 transcript levels also increased after exogenous application of jasmonic , but not upon wounding. Dose-response and time course experiments revealed a similar pattern of transcript accumulation and lipoxygenase activity in BTH-treated rice leaves. Enzymatic analysis of recombinant RCI-1 protein produced in Escherichia coli revealed that 13-hydroperoxy-octadecanoic acids were the predominant reaction products when either linoleic or  used as a substrate.

Since then, numerous studies have determined the role of 12-OPDA in regulating plant , seed dormancy, and germination. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the regulation of 12-OPDA synthesis in the chloroplast and 12-OPDA-dependent signaling in gene expression and targeting protein functions. We describe the properties of OPDA that are linked to the activities of PGs, which are derived from arachidonic  and act as tissue hormones in animals, including humans. The similarity of OPDA with bioactive PGs is particularly evident for the most-studied cyclopentenone, PG 15-dPGJ2. In addition to chemical approaches towards 12-OPDA synthesis, bio-organic synthesis strategies for 12-OPDA and analogous substances have recently been established. The resulting availability of OPDA will aid the identification of additional effector proteins, help in elucidating the mechanisms of OPDA sensing and transmission, and will foster the analysis of the physiological responses to OPDA in plants. There is a need to determine the compartmentation and transport of 12-OPDA and its conjugates, over long distances as well as short. It will be important to further study OPDA in animal and human cells, for example with respect to beneficial anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15325802>Dietary 18:3omega3 influences immune function and the tissue fatty  response to antigens and adjuvant.</a></h2><p> (18:3omega3) has many important physiological functions including being beta-oxidized, serving a precursor to the synthesis of other lipids and it has immunomodulation properties. The objective of the present study was to test the effects of immunization and dietary 18:3omega3 on immune function and the fatty  profile of immunized pig tissues. Piglets suckled from sows consuming either a control or high 18:3omega3 diet until 14 days old when they were weaned onto a similar diet as the sow and were moved to a segregated nursery for the remainder of the study. At 35 days of age, pigs on both diets (2 x 2 factorial design) received either an injection containing hen eggwhite lysozyme (HEWL), killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Freund's complete adjuvant (immunized) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (non-immunized) into the neck followed by a booster injection 2 weeks later and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) one week later. Immunization increased (compared to non-immunized) while the high 18:3omega3 diet decreased haptoglobin by 30% compared to pigs consuming the control diet. Immunized pigs had a seven-fold increase in antibodies to HEWL and pigs consuming the high 18:3omega3 diet also had transiently higher levels of serum antibodies. There was a diet by immunization interaction on the DTH reaction such that immunized pigs consuming the high 18:3omega3 had the largest DTH reaction. The neck muscle proximal to the site of injection of immunized pigs had 10-30% lower levels of triglyceride and phospholipid linoleic (18:2omega6) and 18:3omega3 compared to non-immunized pigs. Thus, a high 18:3omega3 intake in pigs modulates immune function and tissue fatty acids in response to immunization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19793338>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ameliorate the severity of ileitis in the senescence accelerated mice (SAM)P1/Yit mice model.</a></h2><p>Clinical studies using omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega3-PUFA) to Crohn's disease (CD) are conflicting. Beneficial effects of dietary omega3-PUFA intake in various experimental inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) models have been reported. However, animal models of large intestinal inflammation have been used in all previous studies, and the effect of omega3 fat in an animal model of small intestinal inflammation has not been reported. We hypothesized that the effects of omega3 fat are different between large and small intestine. The aim of this study was to determine whether the direct effect of omega3 fat is beneficial for small intestinal inflammation. Senescence accelerated mice (SAM)P1/Yit mice showed remarkable inflammation of the terminal ileum spontaneously. The numbers of F4/80-positive monocyte-macrophage cells as well as beta7-integrin-positive lymphocytes in the intestinal mucosa were increased significantly compared with those in the control mice (AKR-J mice). The area of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1)-positive vessels was also increased. The degree of expression levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon (IFN)-gamma mRNA were increased significantly compared with those in the control mice. The feeding of two different kinds of omega3 fat (fish-oil-rich and perilla-oil-rich diets) for 16 weeks to SAMP1/Yit mice ameliorated inflammation of the terminal ileum significantly. In both the omega3-fat-rich diet groups, enhanced infiltration of F4/80-positive monocytes/macrophages in intestinal mucosa of SAMP1/Yit mice cells and the increased levels of MCP-1, IL-6 and IFN-gamma mRNA expression were ameliorated significantly compared with those in the control diet group. The results suggest that omega3 fat is beneficial for small intestinal inflammation by inhibition of monocyte recruitment to inflamed intestinal mucosa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15182393>The influence of different combinations of gamma-, stearidonic  and EPA on immune function in healthy young male subjects.</a></h2><p>To determine the effects of EPA, stearidonic  (STA) or gamma- (GLA) on immune outcomes, healthy male subjects consumed one of seven oil blends for 12 weeks. EPA consumption increased the EPA content of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Consumption of GLA (2.0 g/d) in the absence of STA or EPA increased di-homo-GLA content in PBMC. Neither STA nor its derivative 20 : 4n-3 appeared in PBMC when STA (<1.0 g/d) was consumed. However, STA (1.0 g/d), in combination with GLA (0.9 g/d), increased the proportion of EPA in PBMC. None of the treatments altered neutrophil or monocyte phagocytosis or respiratory burst, production of inflammatory cytokines by monocytes, T lymphocyte proliferation or the delayed-type hypersensitivity response. Production of cytokines by T lymphocytes increased in all groups, with no differences among them. The proportion of lymphocytes that were natural killer cells decreased significantly in subjects receiving 2.0 g EPA or GLA/d. There were no other effects on lymphocyte sub-populations. Plasma IgE concentration decreased in most groups, but not in the control group. Plasma IgG2 concentration increased in the EPA group. Thus, EPA or GLA at a dose of 2.0 g/d have little effect on key functions of neutrophils, monocytes and T lymphocytes, although at this dose these fatty acids decrease the number of natural killer cells. At this dose EPA increases IgG2 concentrations. STA can increase immune cell EPA status, but at 1.0 g/d does not affect human immune function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9507239>Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids alter rat spleen leukocyte fatty  composition and prostaglandin E2 production but have different effects on lymphocyte functions and cell-mediated .</a></h2><p>Weanling rats were fed on high-fat (178 g/kg) diets which contained 4.4 g  (ALA), gamma-, arachidonic (ARA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), or docosahexaenoic  (DHA)/100 g total fatty acids. The proportions of all other fatty acids, apart from linoleic , and the proportion of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (approximately 35 g/100 g total fatty acids) were constant, and the n-6 to n-3 PUFA ratio was maintained as close to 7 as possible. The fatty  compositions of the serum and of spleen leukocytes were markedly influenced by that of the diet. Prostaglandin E2 production was enhanced from leukocytes from rats fed the ARA-rich diet and was decreased from leukocytes from the EPA- or DHA-fed rats. Replacing dietary ALA with EPA resulted in diminished ex vivo lymphocyte proliferation and natural killer (NK) cell activity and a reduced cell-mediated immune response in vivo. In contrast, replacing ALA with DHA reduced ex vivo lymphocyte proliferation but did not affect ex vivo NK cell activity or the cell-mediated immune response in vivo. Replacement of a proportion of linoleic  with either gamma- or ARA did not affect lymphocyte proliferation, NK cell activity, or the cell-mediated immune response. Thus, this study shows that different n-3 PUFA exert different immunomodulatory actions, that EPA exerts more widespread and/or stronger immunomodulatory effects than DHA, that a low level of EPA is sufficient to influence the immune response, and that the immunomodulatory effects of fish oil may be mainly due to EPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/316494>The nutritional regulation of T lymphocyte function.</a></h2><p>Prostaglandin (PG) E1 plays a major role in the regulation of thymus development and T lymphocyte function and the evidence for this is reviewed. The production of PGE1 is dependent on nutritional factors with linoleic , gamma-, pyridoxine, zinc and vitamin C playing key roles. Inadequate intake of any one of these will lead to inadequate PGE1 formation and defective T lymphocyte function. Megadoses of any one are likely to be only minimally effective in the absence of adequate intakes of the others. By careful attention to diet it should be possible to activate T lymphocyte function in the large number of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, various auto-immune diseases, multiple sclerosis, and cancer in which such function is defective. It is possible that T lymphocytes may require both endogenous and exogenous PGE1 in order to function adequately. It is therefore of particular interest that many cancer cells and virally infected cells are unable to make PGE1 because they cannot convert linoleic  to gamma-. The direct provision of gamma- or dihomo-gammalinolenic acids in these situations is worthy of full investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1356035> and immune response.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10096116>Dietary n-6 and n-3 fatty acids in  and autoimmune disease.</a></h2><p>Clearly there is much evidence to show that under well-controlled laboratory and dietary conditions fatty  intake can have profound effects on animal models of autoimmune disease. Studies in human autoimmune disease have been less dramatic; however, human trials have been subject to uncontrolled dietary and genetic backgrounds, infection and other environmental influences, and basic trial designs have been inadequate. The impact of dietary fatty acids on animal autoimmune disease models appears to depend on the animal model and the type and amount of fatty acids fed. Diets low in fat, essential fatty -deficient, or high in n-3 fatty acids from fish oils increase the survival and reduce disease severity in spontaneous autoantibody-mediated disease, whilst linoleic -rich diets appear to increase disease severity. In experimentally-induced T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease, essential fatty -deficient diets or diets supplemented with n-3 fatty acids appear to augment disease, whereas n-6 fatty acids prevent or reduce the severity. In contrast, in both T-cell and antibody-mediated auto-immune disease the desaturated and elongated metabolites of linoleic  are protective. Suppression of autoantibody and T lymphocyte proliferation, apoptosis of autoreactive lymphocytes, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production by high-dose fish oils are all likely mechanisms by which n-3 fatty acids ameliorate autoimmune disease. However, these could be undesirable long-term effects of high-dose fish oil which may compromise host . The protective mechanism(s) of n-6 fatty acids in T-cell- mediated autoimmune disease are less clear, but may include dihomo-gamma-- and arachidonic -sensitive immunoregulatory circuits such as Th1 responses, TGF beta 1-mediated effects and Th3-like responses. It is often claimed that n-6 fatty acids promote autoimmune and inflammatory disease based on results obtained with linoleic  only. It should be appreciated that linoleic  does not reflect the functions of dihomo-gamma- and arachidonic , and that the endogenous rate of conversion of linoleic to arachidonic  is slow (Hassam et al. 1975, 1977; Phylactos et al. 1994; Harbige et al. 1995). In addition to effects of dietary fatty acids on immunoregulation, inflammation as a consequence of immune activation in autoimmune disease may also be an important mechanism of action whereby dietary fatty acids modulate disease activity. In conclusion, regulation of gene expression, signal transduction pathways, production of eicosanoids and cytokines, and the action of antioxidant enzymes are all mechanisms by which dietary n-6 and n-3 fatty acids may exert effects on the immune system and autoimmune disease. Probably the most significant of these mechanisms in relation to our current understanding of immunoregulation and inflammation would appear to be via fatty  effects on cytokines. The amount, type and balance of dietary fatty acids and associated antioxidant nutrients appear to impact on the immune system to produce immune-deviation or immunosuppressive effects, and to reduce immune-mediated inflammation which will in turn affect the susceptibility to, or severity of, autoimmune disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2831674>[Clinical and immune-modulating effects of the treatment with unsaturated fatty acids in atopic dermatitis].</a></h2><p>The metabolism of essential unsaturated fatty acids seems to show changes in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD).

A previous work showed that the resistance is associated in leaves with the induction of the first enzyme of the oxylipin pathway, the lipoxygenase (LOX), leading to a faster accumulation of its product, the free 13-hydroperoxy octadecatrienoic  (13-HPOT), 2 days after Botrytis cinerea inoculation. In the present study, we further investigated the stimulation of the oxylipin pathway: metabolites and enzymes of the pathway were analyzed to understand the fate of the 13-HPOT in ISR. Actually the stimulation began upstream the LOX: free  accumulated faster in P. putida BTP1-treated plants than in control. Downstream, the LOX products 13-fatty  hydroperoxides esterified to galactolipids and phospholipids were more abundant in bacterized plants than in control before infection. These metabolites could constitute a pool that will be used after pathogen attack to produce free fungitoxic metabolites through the action of phospholipase A2, which is enhanced in bacterized plants upon infection. Enzymatic branches which can use as substrate the fatty  hydroperoxides were differentially regulated in bacterized plants in comparison to control plants, so as to lead to the accumulation of the most fungitoxic compounds against B. cinerea. Our study, which is the first to demonstrate the accumulation of an esterified defense metabolite during rhizobacteria-mediated induced systemic resistance, showed that the oxylipin pathway is differentially regulated. It suggests that this allows the plant to prepare to a future infection, and to respond faster and in a more effective way to B. cinerea invasion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12069397>Dietary fatty  modulation of mucosally-induced tolerogenic immune responses.</a></h2><p>Immunological unresponsiveness or hyporesponsiveness (tolerance) can be induced by feeding protein antigens to naive animals. Using a classical oral ovalbumin gut-induced tolerance protocol in BALB/c mice we investigated the effects of dietary n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on high-and low-dose oral tolerance (and in non-tolerised animals, i.e. effects of antigen challenge alone) in relation to lymphoproliferative, cytokine and antibody responses. Fish oil rich in long-chain n-3 fatty acids decreased both T-helper (Th) 1- and Th2-like responses. In contrast, borage (Borago officinalis) oil rich in n-6 PUFA, of which gamma- is rapidly metabolised to longer-chain n-6 PUFA, increased Thl-like responses and decreased Th2-like responses, and possibly enhanced suppressor cell or Th3-like activity. These findings are in general agreement with other studies on the effects of long chain n-3 PUFA on immune system functions, and characterise important differences between long-chain n-3 and n-6 PUFA, defining more precisely and broadly the immunological regulatory mechanisms involved. They are also discussed in relation to autoimmune disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1674659>Diacylglycerol production in Jurkat T-cells: differences between CD3, CD2 and PHA activation pathways.</a></h2><p>Diacylglycerol (DAG) production induced after stimulation with either CD3 mAb, a pair of CD2 mAbs or phytohaemagglutinin has been monitored in Jurkat T-cells prelabelled to isotopic equilibrium with seven [3H]- or [14C] fatty acids. It was found that CD3 induced a high production of arachidonic -labelled DAG and a modest production of oleic -DAG. The reverse was observed when using CD2 as activator. Phytohaemagglutinin induced a high production of these two DAG subspecies and in addition induced the production of -labelled DAG. Whatever the activator used no changes were observed in DAG production when cellular phospholipids were prelabelled with either myristic, palmitic, stearic or linoleic acids.

In addition to the effect of the feeding insect the impact of several N-acyl Glns (volicitin, N-palmitoyl-Gln, N-linolenoyl-Gln) from the larval oral secretion was studied. The results showed that the early events upon herbivore attack were: a) a strong V(m) depolarization at the bite zone and an isotropic wave of V(m) depolarization spreading throughout the entire attacked leaf; b) a V(m) depolarization observed for the regurgitant but not with volicitin [N-(17-hydroxy-linolenoyl)-Gln] alone; c) an enhanced influx of Ca(2+) at the very edge of the bite, which is halved, if the Ca(2+) channel blocker Verapamil is used. Furthermore, the dose-dependence effects of N-acyl Gln conjugates-triggered influx of Ca(2+) studied in transgenic aequorin-expressing soybean (Glycine max) cells, showed: a) a concentration-dependent influx of Ca(2+); b) a configuration-independent effect concerning the stereochemistry of the amino  moiety; c) a slightly reduced influx of Ca(2+) after modification of the fatty  backbone by functionalization with oxygen and; d) a comparable effect with the detergent SDS.

In this study, we examined the effect of ALA and its gut lactic  bacteria metabolites 13-hydroxy-9(),15()-octadecadienoic  (13-OH) and 13-oxo-9(),15()-octadecadienoic  (13-oxo) on the differentiation of M2 macrophages from bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) and investigated the underlying mechanisms. BMDCs were stimulated with ALA, 13-OH, or 13-oxo in the presence of IL-4 or IL-13 for 24 h, and significant increases in M2 macrophage markers CD206 and Arginase-1 (Arg1) were observed. In addition, M2 macrophage phenotypes were less prevalent following cotreatment with GPCR40 antagonists or inhibitors of PLC-β and MEK under these conditions, suggesting that GPCR40 signaling is involved in the regulation of M2 macrophage differentiation. In further experiments, remarkable M2 macrophage accumulation was observed in the lamina propria of the small intestine of C57BL/6 mice after intragastric treatments with ALA, 13-OH, or 13-oxo at 1 g/kg of body weight per day for 3 d.

FML produced significant reductions in tear IL-17A (-71.1 ± 14.3%, n = 12) and IL-6 (-47.6 ± 17.5%, n = 12, P < 0.05) relative to its baseline (week 12). At week 12, tear IL-17A levels were reduced from baseline in the oral fish oil (-63.2 ± 12.8%, n = 12, P < 0.05) and topical omega-3 (-76.2 ± 10.8%, n = 10, P < 0.05) groups, compared with placebo (-3.8 ± 12.7%, n = 12). Tear IL-6 was reduced with all omega-3 interventions, relative to placebo (P < 0.05) at week 12.CLD was attenuated by oral long-chain omega-3 supplementation for 12 weeks. Acute (2 week) topical corticosteroids and longer-term (12 week) omega-3 supplementation reduced tear levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-17A and IL-6, demonstrating parallels in modulating ocular inflammation with these approaches.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10484041>Diabetic neuropathy: pathogenesis and therapy.</a></h2><p>Diabetic neuropathies are complex, heterogeneous disorders that encompass a wide range of abnormalities affecting both peripheral and autonomic nervous systems, causing considerable morbidity and mortality. Treatment should be based upon the underlying etiology and not symptoms alone, although symptomatic therapy is needed. Neuropathies may be focal or diffuse, proximal or distal, and involve somatic and autonomic nerves. Focal syndromes are classified as (1) entrapment syndromes or (2) mononeuropathies. Entrapment syndromes are treated by means of relieving compression within confined spaces. Mononeuropathies are due to a vascular insult and resolve spontaneously. They are best treated by supportive therapy. Proximal neuropathies are usually due to an inflammatory, vasculitic, or autoimmune condition and are best treated with specific therapies for the underlying disorder based on biopsy findings. Therapies for distal polyneuropathies include metabolic treatments (e.g., aldose reductase inhibitors, aminoguanidine, gamma-), autoimmune therapies, and nerve growth factors. No definitive treatment is available for painful diabetic neuropathy. Several medications have been used, among them tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, phenothiazines, calcitonin, local anesthetics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and dextromethorphan. Nonpharmacologic therapies include surgical sympathectomy, spinal cord blockade, electrical spinal cord stimulation, and prostaglandin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25547427>Dietary ALA, but not LNA, increase growth, reduce inflammatory processes, and increase anti-oxidant capacity in the marine finfish Larimichthys crocea: dietary ALA, but not LNA, increase growth, reduce inflammatory processes, and increase anti-oxidant capacity in the large yellow croaker.</a></h2><p>Whilst aquaculture feed is increasingly formulated with the inclusion of plant oils replacing fish oil, and increasing research effort has been invested in understanding the metabolic effects of reduced dietary n-3 long chain poly unsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA), relatively little information is available on the potential direct metabolic roles of dietary  (ALA, 18:3n-3) and /linoleic  (LNA, 18:2n-6) ratio in cultured marine finfish species. In this study, four plant oil based diets, with varying ALA/LNA ratio (0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5) were fed to juvenile large yellow croakers (Larimichthys crocea) and compared to a fish oil-based control diet (CD) to evaluate the resulting effects on growth, nonspecific , anti-oxidant capacity and related gene expression. High dietary LNA negatively impacted fish growth performance, nonspecific  and antioxidant capacity, but growth and  were maintained to levels comparable to CD by increasing the ratio of dietary ALA/LNA. The over-expression of genes associated with inflammation (cyclooxygenase-2 and interleukin-1β) and fatty  oxidation (carnitine palmitoyl transferase I and acyl CoA oxidase) in croakers fed high concentrations of LNA were reduced to levels comparable to those fed CD by increasing dietary ALA/LNA. This study showed that dietary ALA, by increasing the overall n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio, exerts direct anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, similar to those exerted by dietary n-3 LC-PUFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26283408>Maternal fatty  desaturase genotype correlates with infant immune responses at 6 months.</a></h2><p>Breast milk long-chain PUFA (LCPUFA) have been associated with changes in early life immune responses and may modulate T-cell function in infancy. We studied the effect of maternal fatty  desaturase (FADS) genotype and breast milk LCPUFA levels on infants' blood T-cell profiles and ex vivo-produced cytokines after anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 6-month-old infants from the Copenhagen Prospective Study of Asthma in Childhood birth cohort. LCPUFA concentrations of breast milk were assessed at 4 weeks of age, and FADS SNP were determined in both mothers and infants (n 109). In general, breast milk arachidonic  (AA) levels were inversely correlated with the production of IL-10 (r -0.25; P=0.004), IL-17 (r -0.24; P=0.005), IL-5 (r -0.21; P=0.014) and IL-13 (r -0.17; P=0.047), whereas EPA was positively correlated with the counts of blood regulatory T-cells and cytotoxic T-cells and decreased T-helper cell counts. The minor FADS alleles were associated with lower breast milk AA and EPA, and infants of mothers carrying the minor allele of FADS SNP rs174556 had higher production of IL-10 (r -0.23; P=0.018), IL-17 (r -0.25; P=0.009) and IL-5 (r -0.21; P=0.038) from ex vivo-activated immune cells. We observed no association between T-cell distribution and maternal or infant FADS gene variants. We conclude that increased maternal LCPUFA synthesis and breast milk AA are associated with decreased levels of IL-5, IL-13 (type-2 related), IL-17 (type-17 related) and IL-10 (regulatory immune responses), but not with interferon-γ and TNF-α, which could be due to an effect of the maternal FADS variants on the offspring immune response transferred via breast milk LCPUFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12970495>Nitrogen deficiency increases volicitin-induced volatile emission, jasmonic  accumulation, and ethylene sensitivity in maize.</a></h2><p>Insect herbivore-induced plant volatile emission and the subsequent attraction of natural enemies is facilitated by fatty -amino  conjugate (FAC) elicitors, such as volicitin [N-(17-hydroxylinolenoyl)-L-glutamine], present in caterpillar oral secretions. Insect-induced jasmonic  (JA) and ethylene (E) are believed to mediate the magnitude of this variable response. In maize (Zea mays) seedlings, we examined the interaction of volicitin, JA, and E on the induction of volatile emission at different levels of nitrogen (N) availability that are known to influence E sensitivity. N availability and volicitin-induced sesquiterpene emission are inversely related as maximal responses were elicited in N-deficient plants. Plants with low N availability demonstrated similar volatile responses to volicitin (1 nmol plant(-1)) and JA (100 nmol plant(-1)). In contrast, plants with medium N availability released much lower amounts of volicitin-induced sesquiterpenes compared with JA, suggesting an alteration in volicitin-induced JA levels. As predicted, low N plants exhibited greater sustained increases in wound- and volicitin-induced JA levels compared with medium N plants. N availability also altered volicitin-E interactions. In low N plants, E synergized volicitin-induced sesquiterpene and indole emission 4- to 12-fold, with significant interactions first detected at 10 nL L(-1) E. Medium N plants demonstrated greatly reduced volicitin-E interactions. Volicitin-induced sesquiterpene emission was increased by E and was decreased by pretreatment the E perception inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene without alteration in volicitin-induced JA levels. N availability influences plant responses to insect-derived elicitors through changes in E sensitivity and E-independent JA kinetics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23790934>Echium oil is better than rapeseed oil in improving the response of barramundi to a disease challenge.</a></h2><p>Pathogen infection stimulates the fatty  (FA) metabolism and the production of pro-inflammatory derivatives of FA. Barramundi, Lates calcarifer, was fed on a diet rich in preformed long-chain (⩾C20) polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) from fish oil (FO), to compare with diets containing high levels of C18 precursors for LC-PUFA - stearidonic (SDA) and γ- (GLA) - from Echium plantagineum (EO), or rapeseed oil (RO) rich in α- (ALA), but a poor source of LC-PUFA and their precursors. After 6weeks, when growth rates were similar amongst the dietary treatments, a sub-lethal dose of Streptococcus iniae was administered to half of the fish, while the other half were maintained unchallenged and were pair-fed with the infected fish. Under a disease challenge situation, the tissue FA depots depleted at 3days post-infection (DPI) and were then restored to their previous concentrations at 7DPI. During the infection period, EO fish had a higher content of n3 and n6 PUFA in their tissues, higher n3:n6 PUFA ratio and reduced levels of the eicosanoids, TXB2 and 6-keto-PGF1α, in their plasma compared with RO fish. Fish fed on FO and EO had a longer lasting and enduring response in their FA and eicosanoid concentrations, following a week of bacterial infection, compared with those fed on RO. EO, containing SDA and GLA and with a comparatively higher n3:n6 PUFA ratio, proved more effective than RO in compensating for  stress.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

NLRX1 is a mitochondrial-associated NOD-like receptor involved in the modulation of immune and metabolic responses. This study utilizes molecular docking approaches to investigate the structure of NLRX1 and experimentally assesses binding to naturally occurring compounds from several natural product and lipid databases. Screening of compound libraries predicts targeting of NLRX1 by conjugated trienes, polyketides, prenol lipids, sterol lipids, and coenzyme A-containing fatty acids for activating the NLRX1 pathway. The ligands of NLRX1 were identified by docking punicic  (PUA), eleostearic  (ESA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) to the C-terminal fragment of the human NLRX1 (cNLRX1). Their binding and that of positive control RNA to cNLRX1 were experimentally determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy. In addition, the ligand binding sites of cNLRX1 were predicted in silico and validated experimentally. Target mutagenesis studies demonstrate that mutation of 4 critical residues ASP677, PHE680, PHE681, and GLU684 to alanine resulted in diminished affinity of PUA, ESA, and DHA to NLRX1. Consistent with the regulatory actions of NLRX1 on the NF-κB pathway, treatment of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM)s with PUA and DHA suppressed NF-κB activity in a NLRX1 dependent mechanism. In addition, a series of pre-clinical efficacy studies were performed using a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Our findings showed that the regulatory function of PUA on colitis is NLRX1 dependent. Thus, we identified novel small molecules that bind to NLRX1 and exert anti-inflammatory actions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31255640>Biosynthetic pathway of arachidonic  in Spodoptera exigua in response to bacterial challenge.</a></h2><p>Eicosanoids play crucial roles in mediating insect immune responses. In vertebrates, phospholipase A (PLA) releases arachidonic  (AA) from phospholipids (PLs) for biosynthesis of various eicosanoids. However, little AA is found in PLs of lepidopteran insects. Spodoptera exigua, a lepidopteran insect, is known to use eicosanoids to mediate . Although AA was not detected in PLs of hemocytes and fat body (two immune tissues) of naïve larvae, it was detected at small but significant level after bacterial infection, suggesting induction of AA biosynthesis for . Based on a mammalian AA biosynthetic pathway, this study hypothesizes that AA is synthesized from C18 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) precursor by subsequent desaturation and elongation reactions because PLs of S. exigua larvae are rich in linoleic . After inhibiting PLA activity to prevent release of free fatty acids, different PUFA precursors were injected to S. exigua larvae followed by assessment of eicosanoid-mediated cellular immune response. ω-6 PUFAs were effective in inducing immune response whereas α- (an ω-3 PUFA) was not. Several fatty acyl desaturases (SeDESs) have been predicted from S. exigua transcriptomes. Specific inhibitors against Δ5 or Δ6 DESs inhibited eicosanoid-mediated immune responses. Furthermore, RNA interference (RNAi) specific to Δ5 or Δ6 DES genes significantly suppressed eicosanoid-mediated immune responses. Four very long chain fatty  elongase genes (SeEloV-A ∼ SeEloV-D) were predicted. Among respective RNAi treatments of these genes, only one RNAi treatment specific to type 5 elongase (SeEloV-B) suppressed eicosanoid-mediated immune response. These results suggest that S. exigua larvae can synthesize AA from linoleic  via Δ5- and Δ6-desaturations by SeDESs along with chain elongation by SeEloV-B. Finally, this study showed significant fitness cost of uncontrolled AA biosynthesis. AA injection alone without bacterial challenge significantly induced both cellular and humoral immune responses. This unnecessary energy expense due to free AA resulted in reduced pupal size and decreased adult egg production. The detrimental effect of free AA explains physiological significance of little AA content in lepidopteran insects except for life-or-death situation such as pathogen infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the potato-Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) De Barry (P. infestans) relationships, the role of colneleic and colnelenic acids, two oxylipins resulting from the consecutive action of lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.12) and divinyl ether synthase (EC 1.-) on respectively linoleic and  acids have been previously reported. In the present paper, five potato cultivars with contrasting resistance to P. infestans were submitted to infection. Lipoxygenase pathway response was studied at both transcriptional and metabolic levels. A Northern blot preliminary study revealed that lipoxygenase (lox1 and lox3) and divinyl ether synthase genes were clearly up-regulated 96h after leaf inoculation with P. infestans. Profiling of free and esterified oxylipins performed 24h, 48h, 72h and 96h after inoculation, showed that esterified oxylipins are mainly produced with 9-derivatives in higher concentrations (esterified forms of colnelenic , 9-hydroxy octadecatrienoic , 9-hydroperoxy octadecatrienoic ). Oxylipin accumulation is undetectable 24h after infection, slightly detectable after 48h, reaching highest concentrations after 96h. Cultivars show slightly different oxylipin profiles but the concentration of individual oxylipins differs markedly 96h after infection. No correlation was found between P. infestans resistance levels and oxylipin synthesis rates or concentration. To assess local and systemic effects of colneleic  application before P. infestans infection, Bintje cultivar was sprayed with colneleic  72h before inoculation. Both application modes (local and systemic) resulted in lipoxygenase pathway activation without affecting the resistance level to the pathogen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11030589>Docosahexaenoic -containing phosphatidylcholine affects the binding of monoclonal antibodies to purified Kb reconstituted into liposomes.</a></h2><p>Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC I) molecules are transmembrane proteins that bind and present peptides to T-cell antigen receptors. The role of membrane lipids in controlling MHC I structure and function is not understood, although membrane lipid composition influences cell surface expression of MHC I. We reconstituted liposomes with purified MHC I (Kb) and probed the effect of lipid composition on MHC I structure (monoclonal anti-MHC I antibody binding). Four phospholipids were compared; each had a phosphocholine head group, stearic  in the sn-1 position, and either oleic, , arachidonic, or docosahexaenoic  (DHA) in the sn-2 position. The greatest binding of monoclonal antibody AF6-88.5, which detects a conformationally sensitive epitope in the extracellular region of the MHC I alpha-chain, was achieved with DHA-containing proteoliposomes. Other epitopes (CTKb, 5041.16.1) showed some sensitivity to lipid composition. The addition of beta2-microglobulin, which associates non-covalently with the alpha-chain and prevents alpha-chain aggregation, did not equalize antibody binding to proteoliposomes of different lipid composition, suggesting that free alpha-chain aggregation was not responsible for disparate antibody binding. Thus, DHA-containing membrane lipids may facilitate conformational change in the extracellular domains of the alpha-chain, thereby modulating MHC I function through effects on that protein's structure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14615603>Plastidial fatty  signaling modulates salicylic - and jasmonic -mediated defense pathways in the Arabidopsis ssi2 mutant.</a></h2><p>A mutation in the Arabidopsis gene ssi2/fab2, which encodes stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (S-ACP-DES), results in the reduction of oleic  (18:1) levels in the mutant plants and also leads to the constitutive activation of NPR1-dependent and -independent defense responses. By contrast, ssi2 plants are compromised in the induction of the jasmonic  (JA)-responsive gene PDF1.2 and in resistance to the necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Although S-ACP-DES catalyzes the initial desaturation step required for JA biosynthesis, a mutation in ssi2 does not alter the levels of the JA precursor  (18:3), the perception of JA or ethylene, or the induced endogenous levels of JA. This finding led us to postulate that the S-ACP-DES-derived fatty  (FA) 18:1 or its derivative is required for the activation of certain JA-mediated responses and the repression of the salicylic  (SA) signaling pathway. Here, we report that alteration of the prokaryotic FA signaling pathway in plastids, leading to increased levels of 18:1, is required for the rescue of ssi2-triggered phenotypes. 18:1 levels in ssi2 plants were increased by performing epistatic analyses between ssi2 and several mutants in FA pathways that cause an increase in the levels of 18:1 in specific compartments of the cell. A loss-of-function mutation in the soluble chloroplastic enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (ACT1) completely reverses SA- and JA-mediated phenotypes in ssi2. In contrast to the act1 mutation, a loss-of-function mutation in the endoplasmic reticulum-localized omega6 oleate desaturase (FAD2) does not alter SA- or JA-related phenotypes of ssi2. However, a mutation in the plastidial membrane-localized omega6 desaturase (FAD6) mediates a partial rescue of ssi2-mediated phenotypes. Although ssi2 fad6 plants are rescued in their morphological phenotypes, including larger size, absence of visible lesions, and straight leaves, these plants continue to exhibit microscopic cell death and express the PR-1 gene constitutively. In addition, these plants are unable to induce the expression of PDF1.2 in response to the exogenous application of JA. Because the act1 mutation rescues all of these phenotypes in ssi2 fad6 act1 triple-mutant plants, act1-mediated reversion may be mediated largely by an increase in the free 18:1 content within the chloroplasts. The reversion of JA responsiveness in ssi2 act1 plants is abolished in the ssi2 act1 coi1 triple-mutant background, suggesting that both JA- and act1-generated signals are required for the expression of the JA-inducible PDF1.2 gene. Our conclusion that FA signaling in plastids plays an essential role in the regulation of SSI2-mediated defense signaling is further substantiated by the fact that overexpression of the N-terminal-deleted SSI2, which lacks the putative plastid-localizing transit peptide, is unable to rescue ssi2-triggered phenotypes, as opposed to overexpression of the full-length protein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17555043>Effect on the immune system of germ-free piglets of probiotics potentiated with polyunsaturated fatty acids.</a></h2><p>The present study investigated the influence of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on the immune system of germ-free piglets.

At the age of 21 days both groups of germ-free piglets were inoculated perorally with Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei at a dose of 2 ml (1x10(8) mli). At the age of 28 days, i.e. after one-week colonisation of germ-free piglets with Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, significant differences were recorded in phagocytic activity of neutrophils (PANe) and phagocytic activity of potentially phagocytizing cells (PA) (P < 0.05). Between EG and CG there have been observed no significant differences in absolute numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and numbers of IgM cells and in additional investigated parameters - number of CD2+ T lymphocytes, index of phagocytic activity of neutrophils (IPANe) and index of phagocytic activity (IPA).

Western diets generally provide a 10 to 20-fold deficit in omega-3 PUFAs compared with omega-6, and this is thought to have contributed to the marked rise in incidence of disorders of modern human societies, such as heart disease, colitis and perhaps osteoporosis. Many of our food production animals, fed on grains rich in omega-6, are also exposed to a dietary deficit in omega-3, with perhaps similar health consequences. Bone fragility due to osteoporotic changes in laying hens is a major economic and welfare problem, with our recent estimates of breakage rates indicating up to 95% of free range hens suffer breaks during lay.Free range hens housed in full scale commercial systems were provided diets supplemented with omega-3 , and the skeletal benefits were investigated by comparison to standard diets rich in omega-6.There was a significant 40-60% reduction in keel bone breakage rate, and a corresponding reduction in breakage severity in the omega-3 supplemented hens. There was significantly greater bone density and bone mineral content, alongside increases in total bone and trabecular volumes. The mechanical properties of the omega-3 supplemented hens were improved, with strength, energy to break and stiffness demonstrating significant increases. Alkaline phosphatase (an osteoblast marker) and tartrate-resistant  phosphatase (an osteoclast marker) both showed significant increases with the omega-3 diets, indicating enhanced bone turnover. This was corroborated by the significantly lower levels of the mature collagen crosslinks, hydroxylysyl pyridinoline, lysyl pyridinoline and histidinohydroxy-lysinonorleucine, with a corresponding significant shift in the mature:immature crosslink ratio.The improved skeletal health in laying hens corresponds to as many as 68million fewer hens suffering keel fractures in the EU each year. The biomechanical and biochemical evidence suggests that increased bone turnover has enhanced the bone mechanical properties, and that this may suggest potential benefits for human osteoporosis.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Cells from obese pigs were significantly more effective at Fc (gamma)-mediated phagocytosis than those from lean pigs, both for percentage of total cells phagocytosing (P less than 0.044) and for the average number of opsonized sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) ingested per phagocyte (P less than 0.045). A seasonal interaction was noted for average number of SRBC ingested per phagocyte: the relative difference in macrophage responses between obese and lean groups became significantly more pronounced during winter and spring months (P less than 0.080). Macrophages from obese pigs also exhibited higher phagocytic activities at C3-mediated phagocytosis than did cells from lean pigs, but these differences were significant only for average number of SRBC ingested per phagocyte (P less than 0.080). Exogenous  was added to selected cultures undergoing Fc (gamma)-mediated phagocytosis. Addition of the fatty  frequently caused enhanced phagocytosis. Macrophages from obese pigs were stimulated by fatty  treatment more frequently than cells from lean pigs (P less than 0.05). Relatively greater enhancement was also seen in cells from obese pigs, when compared with those from lean swine (P less than 0.025).

In this report, we investigate the effects of the immediate (DGLA, precursor to PGE1), arachidonic  (AA, PGE precursors, dihomogamma  (DGLA, precursor to PGE1), arachidonic  (AA, precursor to PGE2), and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, precursor to PGE3) on IL-2 production by PHA-stimulated human PBMC. DGLA and AA inhibited IL-2 production in a dose-dependent manner: half-maximal inhibition was obtained by using the fatty acids at the dose of 10 micrograms/ml without significant effects on cell viability. EPA inhibited IL-2 production by PBMC of only some donors. Incubation of cells in the presence of oleic, stearic, and palmitic acids, which are not PG precursors, did not affect mitogen-induced IL-2 production. A progressive increase in incorporation of DGLA into cellular lipids was observed over a 48-h incubation period. IL-2 production was reduced also when PBMC were pretreated overnight with DGLA or AA and washed before exposure to PHA. Whereas addition of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, at the time of mitogenic stimulation led to increased IL-2 production and prevented mitogen- and fatty -induced increases in PGE release, it had no significant effect on the capacity of the fatty acids to suppress IL-2 production. Time course experiments showed that DGLA and AA inhibited IL-2 production even at times of minimal or no PGE release by the treated cultures. Moreover, DGLA and AA inhibited IL-2 production by the human leukemia T cell line Jurkat which, when appropriately induced, is able to release high levels of IL-2 in the absence of accessory cells and measurable PGE production. Taken together, these data indicate that essential fatty acids inhibit IL-2 production directly without conversion into their cyclo-oxygenase pathway products, and suggest that human lymphocyte function may be altered profoundly by small changes in their fatty  profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20868496>Zizyphus lotus L.

This plant is used in Algerian traditional medicine for its anti-diabetic, sedative, analgesic, anti-inflammatory and hypoglycaemic activities. In the present study, we determined the concentrations of different vitamins (vitamin A, C and E) and fatty acids in root, stem, leaves, fruit pulp and seed of Zizyphus lotus L. (Desf.) and assessed the effects of their aqueous extracts on antioxidant status and human T-cell proliferation.Aqueous filtrates from different parts, i.e, root, leaf, stem, fruit pulp and seed, of Zizyphus lotus L. (Desf.) were prepared. Vitamin C levels were determined by precipitating with 10% trichloroacetic  and vitamin A and E were assessed by HPLC. Lipid composition of these extracts was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. Anti-oxidant capacity was evaluated by using anti-radical resistance kit [Kit Radicaux Libres (KRL@; Kirial International SA, Couternon, France)]. T-cell blastogenesis was assessed by the incorporation of 3H-thymidine. IL-2 gene expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR.Our results show that fruit pulp contained higher vitamin A and C contents than other parts of the plant. Furthermore, the fruit pulp was the richest source of linoleic  (18:2n-6), a precursor of n-6 fatty acids. Fruit seeds possessed higher vitamin C levels than leaves, roots and stem. The leaves were the richest source of vitamin E and  (18:3n-3), a precursor of n-3 fatty acids. The antioxidant capacity of the different extracts, measured by KRL@ test, was as follows: pulp < seed < leaf < root < stem. As far as T-cell proliferation is concerned, we observed that the different extracts of Zizyphus lotus L.

Ratios of thromboxane B2,/B3, leukotriene B4/B5, and prostaglandin E2/E1 were reduced in the macrophages from rats given either the eicosapentaenoic  or eicosapentaenoic  with gamma- diet compared with ratios from rats given the linoleic  diet. Macrophages from rats given the eicosapentaenoic with gamma- diet released 35% or 24% more prostaglandin E1 than macrophages from rats given either the linoleic  or the eicosapentaenoic  diet, respectively. Macrophage superoxide generation, phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan, and killing of S. aureus were similar irrespective of dietary treatment.Short-term enteral feeding with an eicosapentaenoic -enriched or eicosapentaenoic with gamma--enriched diet rapidly modulated the fatty  composition of alveolar macrophage phospholipids, promoted a shift toward formation of less inflammatory eicosanoids by stimulated macrophages, but did not impair alveolar macrophage bactericidal function relative to responses observed after feeding a linoleic  diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22274564>Detailed transcriptomics analysis of the effect of dietary fatty acids on gene expression in the heart.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids comprise the primary energy source for the heart and are mainly taken up via hydrolysis of circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. While most of the fatty acids entering the cardiomyocyte are oxidized, a small portion is involved in altering gene transcription to modulate cardiometabolic functions. So far, no in vivo model has been developed enabling study of the transcriptional effects of specific fatty acids in the intact heart. In the present study, mice were given a single oral dose of synthetic triglycerides composed of one single fatty . Hearts were collected 6 h thereafter and used for whole genome gene expression profiling. Experiments were conducted in wild-type and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α-/- mice to allow exploration of the specific contribution of PPARα. It was found that: 1) C18:3 had the most pronounced effect on cardiac gene expression. 2) The largest similarity in gene regulation was observed between C18:2 and C18:3. Large similarity was also observed between PPARα agonist Wy14643 and C22:6. 3) Many genes were regulated by one particular treatment only. Genes regulated by one particular treatment showed large functional divergence. 4) The majority of genes responding to fatty  treatment were regulated in a PPARα-dependent manner, emphasizing the importance of PPARα in mediating transcriptional regulation by fatty acids in the heart. 5) Several genes were robustly regulated by all or many of the fatty acids studied, mostly representing well-described targets of PPARs (e.g., Acot1, Angptl4, Ucp3) but also including Zbtb16/PLZF, a transcription factor crucial for natural killer T cell function. 6) Deletion and activation of PPARα had a major effect on expression of numerous genes involved in metabolism and . Our analysis demonstrates the marked impact of dietary fatty acids on gene regulation in the heart via PPARα.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7204969>The biologic activity of the immunoregulatory lipoprotein, LDL-In is independent of its free fatty  content.</a></h2><p>The immunoregulatory normal plasma lipoprotein subclass, termed LDL-In, suppresses a number of immune responses in vitro including peripheral blood lymphocyte phytohemagglutinin-stimulated 3H-thymidine uptake, pokeweed mitogen-driven immunoglobulin synthesis, and the generation of cytolytic T cells. In vivo parallels have also been demonstrated. Plasma lipoproteins represent noncovalent complexes of lipid and apolipoprotein chains. Since free fatty acids have been demonstrated to suppress certain lymphocyte responses including mitogen-stimulated 3H-thymidine uptake, we have examined the hypothesis that the free fatty acids associated with LDL-In particles are the biologically active constituents. However, the dose-dependence and the kinetics of LDL-In-mediated suppression were distinctly different from those observed for a number of free fatty acids. In addition, when greater than 92% of the endogenous free fatty acids of LDL-In were removed by incubation in the presence of delipidated albumin, no differences were observed between this free fatty  depleted LDL-In and native LDL-In with respect to suppressive activity for lymphocyte stimulation or binding to the lymphocyte LDL-In receptor. These observations indicate that the interaction of the LDL-In particle with the lymphocyte receptor and the suppression of lymphocyte function are independent of the free fatty  content of this bioregulatory lipoprotein, thus focusing attention on the apolipoprotein chains or the phospholipids and glycolipids of this minor plasma lipoprotein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30890432>Lipid droplets participate in modulating innate immune genes in Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney cells.</a></h2><p>Lipid droplets (LDs) are increasingly being recognized as important immune modulators in mammals, in additional to their function of lipid ester deposition. However, the role of LDs in fish  remains poorly understood. In this study, the function of LDs in the innate immune response of Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) cells, which are the equivalent of myeloid cells in vertebrates, was investigated. LD number and TG content significantly increased in the CIK cells following exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), and polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic  (Poly [I: C]) for 24 h, accompanied by increases in the relative expression of several innate immune genes. However, fatty  compositions of the triglycerides were not changed after treatment with these three pathogenic mimics. LPS, PGN, and Poly (I: C) did not alter the relative expressions of lipogenic (FAS, SCD, and DGAT) and lipid catabolic (PPARα, ATGL, and CPT-1) genes. However, these treatments did increase the mRNA levels of lipid transportation genes (FATP/CD36, ACSL1, and ACSL4), and also decreased the non-esterified fatty  level in the medium. To further explore the role of LDs in the immune response, CIK cells were incubated with different concentrations (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 μM) of exogenous lipid mix (LM; oleic  [OA]:linoleic  [LA]: [LNA] = 2:1:1), and were then transferred to a lipid-free medium and incubated for 24 h. LD size and number increased with the increase in lipid levels, and this was accompanied by increased expression of innate immune genes, including MyD88, IRF3, and IL-1β, which were expressed at their highest levels in 300 μM exogenous lipid mix. Interestingly, after incubating with different fatty acids (LM, OA, LA, LNA, arachidonic  [ARA], and docosahexaenoic  [DHA]; 300 μM), ARA and DHA were more potent in inducing LD formation and innate immune gene expression in the CIK cells. Finally, atglistatin, an ATGL inhibitor, effectively attenuated the expression of most genes upregulated by ARA or DHA, suggesting that lipolysis may be involved in the regulation of immune genes at the transcriptional level. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate that LDs are functional organelles that could act as modulators in the innate immune response of CIK cells. Additionally, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  enriched LDs play a unique role in regulating this process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies have shown that pollen grains, apart from their function as allergen carriers, are a rich exogenous source of eicosanoid-like lipid mediators that are rapidly released on contact with the aqueous phase and thus may contribute to the generation of local inflammatory responses.Here we analyze the biological activity of pollen-associated lipid mediators (PALMs) on peripheral human blood eosinophils.Human eosinophils were coincubated with pollen grains and analyzed by electron microscopy. The lipid mediator composition of aqueous pollen extracts (APEs) was analyzed by HPLC. Human eosinophils were exposed to APEs or lipid fractions from pollen. Effects on eosinophils were tested by transwell migration and surface expression of CD11b.In vitro experiments showed adhesion of eosinophils to Phleum pratense pollen. In chemotaxis assays eosinophils displayed significant directed migration to APEs. HPLC analysis of APEs from Phleum pratense and Betula alba pollen demonstrated the occurrence of linoleic and  as well as their monohydroxylated derivatives. Moreover, total lipid extracts from pollen and RP-HPLC fractions containing monohydroxylated derivatives of linoleic and  induced similar migratory responses, although to a lesser degree than APEs. In addition, APEs and lipid extracts induced up-regulation of CD11b surface expression and secretion of eosinophil cationic protein. APE-induced chemotaxis was blocked by the leukotriene B(4) receptor antagonist LY293111, suggesting that PALMs may serve as ligands for LTB(4) receptors.Pollen grains release lipid mediators that recruit and activate eosinophils in vitro. Similar mechanisms may be effective under natural exposure conditions, in which PALMs may play a role in the recruitment of eosinophils to the site of allergic inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28063950>Dietary /linoleic  ratios modulate immune response, physical barrier and related signaling molecules mRNA expression in the gills of juvenile grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella).</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to explore the possible effects of dietary ALA/LNA ratios on the gill , tight junction and antioxidant capacity, and the related signaling factor mRNA levels of juvenile grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). Fish were fed diets with different ALA/LNA ratios (0.01, 0.34, 0.68, 1.03, 1.41, 1.76 and 2.15) for 60 days. The present results showed that ALA/LNA ratio of 1.03 significantly enhanced lysozyme and  phosphatase activities, complement 3 contents, promoted mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides (Hepcidin and liver expression antimicrobial peptide-2), anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 10 and transforming growth factor β1) and inhibitor protein κBα, whereas suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1β, interleukin 8, tumor necrosis factor a and interferon γ2), and signal molecules (IκB kinase β, IκB kines γ and nuclear factor κB p65) mRNA levels in the gill, indicating that optimal dietary ALA/LNA ratio improve gill  of juvenile fish. Besides, ALA/LNA ratio of 1.03 increased mRNA levels of the barrier functional proteins (occludin, zonula occludens-1, claudin-b, -c and -3), and reduced the pore-formation proteins (claudin-15a) and myosin light-chain kinase mRNA abundance in the gill of juvenile grass carp, indicating optimum ALA/LNA ratio strengthen gill tight junction of juvenile fish. Additionally, ALA/LNA ratio of 1.03 increased glutathione contents, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase activities and mRNA abundance, and nuclear factor erythoid 2-related factor 2 mRNA levels in the gill of fish, suggesting that optimal ALA/LNA ratio ameliorate gill antioxidant status of juvenile fish. Interestingly, dietary ALA/LNA ratios had no effect on IκB kinase α and catalase activities in fish gills. Collectively, optimal dietary ALA/LNA ratio could improve gill  and strengthen physical barrier of juvenile fish. Based on the quadratic regression analysis of complement 3 content in the gill, optimal dietary ALA/LNA ratio for maximum growth of juvenile grass carp was estimated to be 1.12.Copyright © 2017.

Infection of the Fusarium graminearum disruption mutant Δfgl1, which lacks the effector lipase FGL1, is restricted to inoculated wheat (Triticum aestivum) spikelets, whereas the wild-type strain colonized the whole wheat spike. Our studies here were aimed at analyzing the role of FGL1 in establishing full F. graminearum virulence. Confocal laser-scanning microscopy revealed that the Δfgl1 mutant strongly induced the deposition of spot-like callose patches in vascular bundles of directly inoculated spikelets, while these callose deposits were not observed in infections by the wild type. Elevated concentrations of the polyunsaturated free fatty acids (FFAs) linoleic and α-, which we detected in F. graminearum wild type-infected wheat spike tissue compared with Δfgl1-infected tissue, provided clear evidence for a suggested function of FGL1 in suppressing callose biosynthesis. These FFAs not only inhibited plant callose biosynthesis in vitro and in planta but also partially restored virulence to the Δfgl1 mutant when applied during infection of wheat spikelets. Additional FFA analysis confirmed that the purified effector lipase FGL1 was sufficient to release linoleic and α- acids from wheat spike tissue. We concluded that these two FFAs have a major function in the suppression of the innate -related callose biosynthesis and, hence, the progress of F. graminearum wheat infection.</p></html>
