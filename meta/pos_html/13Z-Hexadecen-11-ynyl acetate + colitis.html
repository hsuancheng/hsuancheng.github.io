Capnoidine and scoulerine were isolated from C. dubia, linalool oxide  from A. nubigena and isomyristicin from P. amabile using natural product isolation protocols. Four compounds were investigated for their anti-inflammatory activities against IBD- using chemically induced (TNBS) mice model of . Capnoidine conferred the best preliminary protection against TNBS-induced  in mice and we have conducted in-depth pharmacological investigation of this compound including clinical symptoms, pathological signs, cytokine profiles, histological structure and inflammasomes using relevant bioassay protocols.Capnoidine-treated mice had significantly: a) improved clinical symptoms (body weight loss, mobility, piloerection and faecal consistency); b) reduced colon pathology (adhesion, oedema, ulceration, and colon length); c) altered inflammatory cytokines profiles within the colons; d) reduced levels of p-IκB-α (Ser32) and p-NF-κB p65 (Ser536) and e) reduced histological inflammation in the colon when compared with mice administered TNBS only.Capnoidine presents as a potential new anti-inflammatory drug lead candidate for diseases where current standard-of-care often fails and is associated with major side effects. It also validates the traditional uses of C. dubia against inflammatory conditions and underlines the value of pursuing bioactive compounds derived from traditionally used ethnobotanical medicines.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

T. catigua bark extracts possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and bactericidal properties. These properties suggest T. catigua bark extracts as a potential treatment for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Using the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced model of  in rats we evaluated the effect of an ethyl- fraction (EAF) of T. catigua (200 mg/kg) administered by daily oral gavage or intrarectally at different time points after TNBS challenge. TNBS treatment evoked severe colonic inflammation after 24 h that persisted for 7 days, characterized by weight loss, high levels of myeloperoxidase activity, histological and macroscopic damage, and elevated index of oxidative stress in the blood. T. catigua EAF treatment prevented the oxidative stress within 24 h and enhanced tissue recovery observed at day 7, returning histological and macroscopic damage levels to that of the control group. TNBS treatment led to loss of myenteric neurons after 28 days. T. catigua EAF was unable to prevent the neuronal loss. Oral delivery of T. catigua EAF was more effective than intrarectal administration of the extract. In conclusion, T. catigua EAF treatment normalized oxidative stress parameters in blood and reduced the degree of acute inflammation in TNBS .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In the human colon, both toxins cause intestinal inflammation and stimulate tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) expression via the activation of NF-κB. It is well established that the macrolide antibiotic fidaxomicin is associated with reduced relapses of  infection. We showed that fidaxomicin and its primary metabolite OP-1118 significantly inhibited toxin A-mediated intestinal inflammation in mice  and toxin A-induced cell rounding  We aim to determine whether fidaxomicin and OP-1118 possess anti-inflammatory effects against toxin A and toxin B in the human colon and examine the mechanism of this response. We used fresh human colonic explants, NCM460 human colonic epithelial cells, and RAW264.7 mouse macrophages to study the mechanism of the activity of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 against toxin A- and B-mediated cytokine expression and apoptosis. Fidaxomicin and OP-1118 dose-dependently inhibited toxin A- and B-induced TNF-α and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) mRNA expression and histological damage in human colonic explants. Fidaxomicin and OP-1118 inhibited toxin A-mediated NF-κB phosphorylation in human and mouse intestinal mucosae. Fidaxomicin and OP-1118 also inhibited toxin A-mediated NF-κB phosphorylation and TNF-α expression in macrophages, which was reversed by the NF-κB activator phorbol myristate  (PMA). Fidaxomicin and OP-1118 prevented toxin A- and B-mediated apoptosis in NCM460 cells, which was reversed by the addition of PMA. PMA reversed the cytoprotective effect of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 in toxin-exposed human colonic explants.

However, other phenolic compounds present such as hydroxytyrosyl  (HTy-Ac) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) need to be explored to complete the understanding of the overall effects of EVOO on inflammatory colon mucosa. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of both HTy-Ac and DHPG dietary supplementation in the inflammatory response associated to  model. Six-week-old mice were randomized in four dietary groups: sham and control groups received standard diet, and other two groups were fed with HTy-Ac and DHPG, respectively, at 0.1%. After 30 days, all groups except sham received 3% DSS in drinking water for 5 days followed by a regime of 5 days of water. Acute inflammation was evaluated by Disease Activity Index (DAI), histology and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Colonic expression of iNOS, COX-2, MAPKs, NF-kB and FOXP3 were determined by western blotting. Only HTy-Ac-supplemented group showed a significant DAI reduction as well as an improvement of histological damage and MPO. COX-2 and iNOS protein expression were also significantly reduced. In addition, this dietary group down-regulated JNK phosphorylation and prevented the DSS-induced nuclear translocation level of p65. However, no significant differences were observed in the FOXP3 expression. These results demonstrated, for the first time, that HTy-Ac exerts an antiinflammatory effect on acute ulcerative .

We hypothesise that individual differences in the complex interaction of the host genome and the gut microbiota can explain the onset and the heterogeneous presentation of IBD. Therefore, we performed a case-control analysis of the gut microbiota, the host genome and the clinical phenotypes of IBD.Stool samples, peripheral blood and extensive phenotype data were collected from 313 patients with IBD and 582 truly healthy controls, selected from a population cohort.

We composed genetic risk scores from 11 functional genetic variants proven to be associated with IBD in genes that are directly involved in the bacterial handling in the gut: , , ,  and .Strikingly, we observed significant alterations of the gut microbiota of healthy individuals with a high genetic risk for IBD: the IBD genetic risk score was significantly associated with a decrease in the genus  in healthy controls (false discovery rate 0.017). Moreover, disease location was a major determinant of the gut microbiota: the gut microbiota of patients with colonic Crohn's disease (CD) is different from that of patients with ileal CD, with a decrease in alpha diversity associated to ileal disease (p=3.28×10).We show for the first time that genetic risk variants associated with IBD influence the gut microbiota in healthy individuals.  are -to-butyrate converters, and a decrease has already been observed in patients with IBD.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

The pathogenesis of CAC is complicated and so far elusive, and the anti-inflammatory effect does not assure CAC preventive activity, making it difficult to discover CAC preventive drugs. In this study, we report the CAC preventive effect of the ethyl  (EIR) of Ilex rotunda Thunb., a traditional Chinese herbal medicine being clinically used to treat intestinal disease. We also report the results of screening for CAC preventive agents from EIR via a nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) translocation model in Caco2 cells, since activated NF-κB can be used by tumor cells at the early stage of tumorigenesis. Twenty-four components were isolated from EIR and identified by multiple chromatography and spectral analysis. MTT experiments in IEC-6 and RAW264.7 cells showed that all 24 compounds were toxic-free to normal cell lines. Furthermore, compound rotundic acid (RA) (19) exhibited an inhibitory effect on LPS-induced NF-κB translocation in Caco2 cells. Moreover, RA did not induce apoptosis in Caco2 tumor cells while possessing an anti-inflammatory effect both in immune and intestinal epithelium cells (RAW264.7 and IEC-6 cells, respectively). Removing RA (19) and its 28-O-glucopyranoside (17) from EIR definitely undermined the in vivo CAC preventive activity of EIR. Therefore, the current study suggested that RA (19) could be a potential therapeutic agent against CAC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26297475>High levels of fish oil enhance neutrophil development and activation and influence colon mucus barrier function in a genetically susceptible mouse model.</a></h2><p>Dietary fatty acids influence immunologic homeostasis, but their effect on initiation of , an immune-mediated disease, is not well established. Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that high doses of dietary fish oil (FO) increased colon inflammation and dysplasia in a model of infection-induced . In the current study, we assessed the effects of high-dose dietary FO, 6% by weight, on colon inflammation, neutrophil recruitment and function, and mucus layer integrity in a genetically susceptible, -prone mouse model in the absence of infection. FO-fed SMAD3(-/-) mice had increased colon inflammation evidenced by increased numbers of systemic and local neutrophils and increased neutrophil chemoattractant and inflammatory cytokine gene expression in the colon. Mucus layer thickness in the cecum and goblet cell numbers in the cecum and colon in FO-fed mice were reduced compared to control. FO consumption affected  in male and female mice differently. Compared to female control mice, neutrophils from FO-fed female mice had reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon ex vivo stimulation with phorbol myristate  while FO-fed male mice produced increased ROS compared to control-fed male mice. In summary, dietary FO impaired mucus layer integrity and was associated with colon inflammation characterized by increased neutrophil numbers and altered neutrophil function. High-dose FO may have detrimental effects in populations genetically susceptible for inflammatory bowel disease and these effects may differ between males and females.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We used scanning electron microscopy and observed leukocyte adsorption on Adacolumn beads after granulocytapheresis/granulocyte and monocyte adsorption apheresis. We then compared results between two patients with a low and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels to determine whether adhesion is affected by a difference in leukocyte activity depending on the level of inflammation. We found that the surface layers of the beads from both patients were covered by a clay-like layer, and spherical granulocytes were adsorbed here and there on top of it. In cross-section the adsorbed granulocytes were visible in the clay-like layer and the surface layer alike. The clay-like layer had a maximum thickness of approximately 12 μm in the low CRP patient and approximately 50 μm in the high CRP patient, so in the high CRP patient the clay-like adsorption layer was thicker. Taken together, adsorption onto beads is considered to involve an immunological mechanism. Our findings suggest that granulocytes contact and adhere to each other at the surface layer after adsorption, and that granulocyte-granulocyte adhesion is enhanced by a higher inflammatory response.© 2019 International Society for Apheresis, Japanese Society for Apheresis, and Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31213556>Bifidobacterium dentium Fortifies the Intestinal Mucus Layer via Autophagy and Calcium Signaling Pathways.</a></h2><p>Much remains unknown about how the intestinal microbiome interfaces with the protective intestinal mucus layer.  species colonize the intestinal mucus layer and can modulate mucus production by goblet cells.

This work illustrates that  is capable of enhancing the intestinal mucus layer and goblet cell function via upregulation of gene expression and autophagy signaling pathways, with a net increase in mucin production. Microbe-host interactions in the intestine occur along the mucus-covered epithelium. In the gastrointestinal tract, mucus is composed of glycan-covered proteins, or mucins, which are secreted by goblet cells to form a protective gel-like structure above the epithelium. Low levels of mucin or alterations in mucin glycans are associated with inflammation and  in mice and humans. Although current literature links microbes to the modulation of goblet cells and mucins, the molecular pathways involved are not yet fully understood. Using a combination of gnotobiotic mice and mucus-secreting cell lines, we have identified a human-derived microbe, , which adheres to intestinal mucus and secretes metabolites that upregulate the major mucin MUC2 and modulate goblet cell function. Unlike other  species,  does not extensively degrade mucin glycans and cannot grow on mucin alone.

We found that oxytocin receptor (OTR) was expressed in colonic mast cells in humans and rats, as well as in human mast cell line-1 (HMC-1), rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-2H3) and mouse mastocytoma cell line (P815). OT decreased 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced visceral hypersensitivity, colonic mast cell degranulation and histamine release after mast cell degranulation in rats. Also, OT attenuated the compound 48/80 (C48/80)-evoked histamine release in P815 cells and inward currents, responsible for the mast cell degranulation, in HMC-1, RBL-2H3 and P815 cells. Moreover, these protective effects of OT against visceral hypersensitivity and mast cell degranulation were eliminated by coadministration of OTR antagonist atosiban or a nonselective inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), NG-Methyl-L-arginine  salt (L-NMMA). Notably, OT evoked a concentration-dependent increase of intracellular Ca(2+) in HMC-1, RBL-2H3 and P815 cells, which was responsible for the activation of neuronal NOS (NOS1) and endothelial NOS (NOS3).

However, results of available studies in skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD), are inconsistent, partly because probiotic effects are strain specific. Careful selection of probiotic strains is therefore indispensable to ensure efficacy of treatment. In this study, Lactobacillus salivarius LA307, Lactobacillus rhamnosus LA305 and Bifidobacterium bifidum PI22, three strains that were previously identified for their interesting immunomodulatory properties in allergy and/or  models, were assessed in the prevention of chronic skin inflammation induced by repeated applications of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- in hairless SKH-1 mice. Macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of skin lesions was performed together with measurements of serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IL-17, IL-22, IL-10 and IL-4. Daily oral treatment with the three strains at the dose of 1×10 cfu/day for 3 weeks limited the development of chronic skin inflammation, the effects being strain dependent. Indeed the two Lactobacillus strains significantly limited the intensity of skin inflammation both at the macroscopic and microscopic levels. Macroscopic observations were correlated to the histological observations and the resulting microscopic score. This limitation of the development of AD-like skin lesions involved the modulation of cytokine production. Treatment with the two Lactobacillus strains induced a decrease in the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-17, IL-22 and at the opposite an increase in the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and also of IL-4. Globally, B. bifidum PI22 had lower benefits. These results obtained in mice suggest that L. salivarius LA307 and L. rhamnosus LA305 could be good candidates for preserving skin integrity and homeostasis via the modulation of the gut microbiota and that their use could be beneficial in dermatological conditions such as AD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30775453>Analysis of pH Dose-dependent Growth of Sulfate-reducing Bacteria.</a></h2><p>Lower intraluminal colonic pH is an indication for the development of inflammatory bowel disease including active ulcerative .

Monitoring was done through the measurement of bacterial growth (biomass), dissimilatory sulfate reduction parameters: sulfate consumption, lactate oxidation, hydrogen sulfide and  production. According to our results, we observed that lower pH (<5) significantly inhibited  Vib-7 growth. This inhibition was also noticed when alkaline media (>9 pH) was used, though the reduction was not at the rate as in media with pH of 4. The research indicates that the growth of  Vib-7 is inhibited at pH of 4 which is not as low as the pH found in people with severely developed inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative .

While the host provides the place and food for the bacteria to colonize and live, the bacteria in turn help the host in energy and nutritional homeostasis, development and maturation of the mucosal immune system, and protection against inflammation and carcinogenesis. In this review, we highlight the molecular mediators of the effective communication between the bacteria and the host, focusing on selective metabolites from the bacteria that serve as messengers to the host by acting through selective receptors in the host colon. These bacterial metabolites include the short-chain fatty acids , propionate, and butyrate, the tryptophan degradation products indole-3-aldehyde, indole-3-acetic, acid and indole-3-propionic acid, and derivatives of endogenous bile acids. The targets for these bacterial products in the host include the cell-surface G-protein-coupled receptors GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109A and the nuclear receptors aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), and farnesoid X receptor (FXR). The chemical communication between these bacterial metabolite messengers and the host targets collectively has the ability to impact metabolism, gene expression, and epigenetics in colonic epithelial cells as well as in mucosal immune cells.

We examined the association between DMTs and infection-related medical encounters.Using population-based administrative data from British Columbia, Canada, we identified MS cases and followed them from their first demyelinating event (1996-2013) until emigration, death or study end (December 2013). Associations between DMT exposure (by DMT generation or class) and infection-related physician or hospital claims were assessed using recurrent time-to-events models, adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status, index year and comorbidity count. Results were reported as adjusted HRs (aHRs).Of 6793 MS cases, followed for 8.5 years (mean), 1716 (25.3%) were DMT exposed. Relative to no DMT, exposure to any first-generation DMT (beta-interferon or glatiramer ) was not associated with infection-related physician claims (aHR: 0.96; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.02), nor was exposure to these drug classes when assessed separately. Exposure to any second-generation DMT (oral DMT or natalizumab) was associated with an increased hazard of an infection-related physician claim (aHR: 1.47; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.85); when assessed individually, the association was significant for natalizumab (aHR: 1.59; 95% CI 1.19 to 2.11) but not the oral DMTs (aHR: 1.17; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.56). While no DMTs were associated with infection-related hospital claims, these hospitalisations were also uncommon.Exposure to first-generation DMTs was not associated with an altered infection risk. However, exposure to the second-generation DMTs was, with natalizumab associated with a 59% increased risk of an infection-related physician claim. Continued pharmacovigilance is warranted, including an investigation of the DMT-associated infection burden on patient outcomes.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

We performed a retrospective analysis with the aim of evaluating the adequacy of the prerequisites for arriving at an accurate histological diagnosis.The following parameters were considered as prerequisites for a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease: clinical and endoscopic data; proper sampling and handling of biopsies; and elementary microscopic lesions. We collected 345 cases from 13 centres.The date of onset and treatment were available for 13% and 16% of the cases, respectively. Endoscopy information was accessible for 77% of the cases. Endoscopic mapping was completed in 13% of the cases. In no cases were the biopsies oriented on  strips. The diagnosis was conclusive in 47% of the cases. Activity, epithelial disruption and crypt distortion were described in 35% of the reports with a conclusive diagnosis.Our study showed that the diagnostic prerequisites were widely unfulfilled, although approximately half of the diagnoses were conclusive for inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, in our assessment of clinical practice: (1) clinicians seldom provide suitable clinical and/or endoscopic information for a histological diagnosis and (2) histopathological diagnoses of inflammatory bowel disease are often not supported by morphology.Copyright © 2014 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect and mechanism of alpinetin on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  in mice. In vivo, DSS-induced mice  model was established by giving mice drinking water containing 5% (w/v) DSS for 7 days. Alpinetin (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) were administered once a day by intraperitoneal injection 3 days before DSS treatment. In vitro, phorbol myristate  (PMA)-differentiated monocytic THP-1 macrophages were treated with alpinetin and stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The results showed that alpinetin significantly attenuated diarrhea, colonic shortening, histological injury, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and the expressions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL-1β) production in mice. In vitro, alpinetin markedly inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-1β production, as well as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mediated nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that alpinetin had protective effects on DSS-induced  and may be a promising therapeutic reagent for  treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25780093>Strengthening of the intestinal epithelial tight junction by Bifidobacterium bifidum.</a></h2><p>Epithelial barrier dysfunction has been implicated as one of the major contributors to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. The increase in intestinal permeability allows the translocation of luminal antigens across the intestinal epithelium, leading to the exacerbation of . Thus, therapies targeted at specifically restoring tight junction barrier function are thought to have great potential as an alternative or supplement to immunology-based therapies. In this study, we screened Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, and Lactobacillus species for beneficial microbes to strengthen the intestinal epithelial barrier, using the human intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco-2) in an in vitro assay. Some Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species prevented epithelial barrier disruption induced by TNF-α, as assessed by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). Furthermore, live Bifidobacterium species promoted wound repair in Caco-2 cell monolayers treated with TNF-α for 48 h. Time course (1)H-NMR-based metabonomics of the culture supernatant revealed markedly enhanced production of  after 12 hours of coincubation of B. bifidum and Caco-2. An increase in TER was observed by the administration of  to TNF-α-treated Caco-2 monolayers. Interestingly, -induced TER-enhancing effect in the coculture of B. bifidum and Caco-2 cells depends on the differentiation stage of the intestinal epithelial cells. These results suggest that Bifidobacterium species enhance intestinal epithelial barrier function via metabolites such as .© 2015 The Authors.

Whether SCFAs suppress tumorigenesis in -associated colorectal cancer remains unknown. The chemopreventive effect of SCFAs in -associated colorectal cancer was evaluated in this study. Model of -associated colorectal cancer in male BALB/c mice was induced by azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). SCFAs mix (67.5 mM , 40 mM butyrate, 25.9 mM propionate) was administered in drink water during the study period. Macroscopic and histological studies were performed to examine the colorectal inflammation and tumorigenesis in AOM/DSS-induced mice treated with or without SCFA mix. The effects of SCFAs mix on colonic epithelial cellular proliferation were also assessed using Ki67 immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining. The administration of SCFAs mix significantly reduced the tumor incidence and size in mice with AOM/DSS-induced  associated colorectal cancer. SCFAs mix protected from AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer by improving colon inflammation and disease activity index score as well as suppressing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6, TNF-α and IL-17. A decrease in cell proliferation markers and an increase in TUNEL-positive tumor epithelial cells were also demonstrated in AOM/DSS mice treated with SCFAs mix. SCFAs mix administration prevented development of tumor and attenuated the colonic inflammation in a mouse model of -associated colorectal cancer. SCFAs mix may be a potential agent in the prevention and treatment of -associated colorectal cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This study designed coatless delayed-release oral colon-specific alginate pellets for ulcerative  treatment. Alginate pellets, formulated with water-insoluble ethylcellulose and various calcium salts, were prepared using solvent-free melt pelletization technique which prevented reaction between processing materials during agglomeration and allowed reaction to initiate only in dissolution. Combination of acid-soluble calcium carbonate and highly water-soluble calcium  did not impart colon-specific characteristics to pellets due to pore formation in fragmented matrices. Combination of moderately water-soluble calcium phosphate and calcium  delayed drug release due to rapid alginate crosslinking by soluble calcium from  salt followed by sustaining alginate crosslinking by calcium phosphate. The use of 1:3 ethylcellulose-to-alginate enhanced the sustained drug release attribute. The ethylcellulose was able to maintain the pellet integrity without calcium . Using hydrophobic prednisolone as therapeutic, hydrophilic alginate pellets formulated with hydrophobic ethylcellulose and moderately polar calcium phosphate exhibited colon-specific in vitro drug release and in vivo anti-inflammatory action. Coatless oral colon-specific alginate pellets can be designed through optimal formulation with melt pelletization as the processing technology.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

(P. oleracea) is an herb that is widely used in traditional medicine to treat various diseases. However, its effects on inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are not yet well characterized. Here, we investigated the impact of the ethyl  (EtOAc) and ethanol (EtOH) extracts of P. oleracea on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses and phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages. In addition, the inhibitory effects of these extracts and fractions on 3% dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative  were examined using an ICR mouse model. DSS-induced , including body weight loss, reduced colon length, and histological colon injury, was significantly ameliorated in mice fed the P. oleracea extracts (200 and 500mg/kg). In particular, P. oleracea extracts also inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, and 1L-1β) production in mice with DSS-induced ; the P. oleracea extracts displayed higher and/or similar inhibitory activity to sulfasalazine at high concentrations. Furthermore, the chemical structures of active compounds separated from the EtOAc extract of P. oleracea were elucidated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (see Figure in supplementary materials), resulting in the identification of three known compounds. Among these active compounds, cis-N-feruloyl-3'-methoxytyramine (2) exhibited the strongest effects on preventing DSS-induced IBD in animal models. Thus, extract of P. oleracea and their active compounds represents a new therapeutic approach for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The differences of visceral sensitivity, , and brain activation between Fawn-Hooded (FH/Wjd) and Sprague-Dawley(SD) rats were identified after neonatal colon  stimulation.The specific pathogen free Fawn-Hooded (FH/Wjd) and Sprague-Dawley(SD) rats were used to establish irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) model. The visceral sensitivity was measured by colorectal distension (CRD). The expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), mast cell (MC), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in colon and IDO in specific cerebral regions were detected through immunohistochemistry.Abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores showed that visceral sensitivity of -enema groups was significantly higher than that of saline-enema groups (FH/Wjd:2.44 ± 0.04 vs.1.96 ± 0.07, P < 0.05; SD: 1.75 ± 0.13 vs.1.32 ± 0.05, P < 0.05).

[corrected]. A 3(2) full factorial design was adopted for the evaluation of the prepared microspheres. The effect of two independent variables namely polymer type (Eudragit RS100, ethyl cellulose and cellulose  butyrate), and drug: polymer ratio (1:1, 9:1 and 18:1) was studied on the entrapment efficiency and in vitro drug release for 12 h. Colon targeting aims to minimize the release of the drug off target area (pH 1.2 and 6.8) and to maximize the release of the drug in target area (pH 7.4). Candidate formulae were compressed into core tablets and colon targeting was achieved using the enzyme-dependent polymer (pectin) as coat in three different concentrations 50, 75 and 90%. Candidate formula F15 (microspheres prepared using BDZ:CAB in a ratio of 18:1 and compressed into tablets using 50% pectin and 50% Avicel in the coat) was able to adequately modulate drug release avoiding drug release in the gastric ambient, and reaching the colonic targeting where 99.7% release was achieved within 12 h following zero-order model.

The relative incidence of this debilitating condition is increasing and sociologically damaging outcomes are a continued reality. Several etiological theories for UC are currently under investigation, spanning between genetic and environmental determinants. From an environmental perspective, previous literature reviews have demonstrated the independent effectiveness of specific diet and exercise patterns in modifying UC immuno-pathophysiology. This article explores the  role of diet and aerobic exercise in the prevention, pathogenesis, and management of UC in the context of recent immunological research. Through a unifying mechanism-that is, microbial influence of colonic inflammation and immuno-pathophysiology-the simultaneous reduction of pro-inflammatory dietary sulfurous amino acid intake (ie methionine, cysteine, homocysteine, and taurine) and the upregulation of aerobic exercise frequency (which spurs the colonization of anti-inflammatory butyrate, , and propionate producing microbial taxa) demonstrate the clinical efficacy of incorporating both diet and exercise modifications for UC prevention and management through pathogenic alterations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27080173>Granulocytes and monocytes apheresis induces upregulation of TGFβ in patients with active ulcerative : A possible involvement of soluble HLA-I.</a></h2><p>Granulocyte and monocyte apheresis has been used in different immune-mediated disorders, mainly inflammatory bowel diseases. The removal of activated leukocytes and several additional immunomodulatory mechanisms have been so far suggested to explain the anti-inflammatory effects of the treatment. Recent data indicate that, during centrifugation based apheresis, sHLA-I adsorbed to plastic circuits is able to induce TGFβ production in activated leukocytes. On these bases, the present study was aimed at analyzing if this model could be applied to a noncentrifugation based apheresis, such as granulocyte and monocyte apheresis. Ten patients with ulcerative  were enrolled. Every patient received 5 weekly apheresis treatments. Cellulose  beads removed from the column post-GMA were stained by fluorescent anticlass I mAb and examined by fluorescent microscope. Moreover, sFasL plasma concentration, TGFβ plasma levels, and the percentage of TGFβ positive neutrophils were evaluated before and immediately after each single apheresis. Immunofluorescent images revealed a homogeneous layer of a sHLA-I adsorbed to the surface of the beads recovered following the procedure. sFasL plasma concentration progressively increased both following the procedures and during inter-procedure periods. Consistently, also TGFβ plasma levels and the percentage of TGFβ positive neutrophils increased during the procedures with a meaningful relationship with sFasL plasma levels. Taken together, these findings suggest that the immunosuppressive effects attributed to granulocyte and monocyte apheresis might depend, at least in part, on the sensitivity of activated leucocytes to the bioactivity of sHLA-I molecules.

Based on the published literature, there has been no attempt to conduct a comparative assessment of the biological activity and the phytochemical profiles of the leaves and stem bark of  extracted using methanol, ethyl , and water. By high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-ESI-MS) analysis, quinic, shikimic, gallic, and protocatechuic acids were tentatively identified from all the extracts, while chlorogenic, caffeic, ferulic, and dodecanedioic acids were only characterised from the leaves extracts. Additionally, a pharmacological study was carried out to evaluate potential protective effects that are induced by the extracts in rat colon and colon cancer HCT116 cell line. In general, the methanol and water extracts of  leaves and stem bark showed potent radical scavenging and reducing properties. It was noted that the stem bark extracts were more potent antioxidants as compared to the leaves extracts. The methanol extract of  leaves showed the highest acetyl (4.68 mg galantamine equivalent/g) and butyryl (4.0 mg galantamine equivalent/g) cholinesterase inhibition. Among ethyl  extracts, the pharmacological investigation suggested stem bark ethyl  extracts to be the most promising. This extract revealed ability to protect rat colon from lipopolysaccharide-induced oxidative stress, without exerting promoting effects on HCT116 cell line viability and migration.

Major components included 3(2H)-benzofuranone, asarinin and (dimethoxymethyl)-3-methoxy-benzene. A total of 18 compounds were isolated from the ethyl  extracts of Maqian bark by column chromatography and identified by chemical and spectral analyses. Rhoifoline B, zanthoxyline dimethoxy derivative, N-nortidine, nitidine, decarine are the major alkaloids. Both the petroleum ether and ethyl  extracts showed significant inhibition on NO production, which imply anti-inflammatory activity, in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW 264.7 cells without cell toxicity. Decarine is the major anti-inflammatory constituent with NO IC values of 48.43 μM on RAW264.7 cells. The petroleum ether extract, the ethyl  extract and decarine showed anti-inflammatory activities through inhibiting TNF-α and IL-1β production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated THP-1 cells without cell toxicity too. Decarine showed anti-inflammatory activity on human colon cells by reducing IL-6 and IL-8 production in TNF-α+IL-1β-induced Caco-2 cells.

Fertility is normal in women with nonsurgically treated ulcerative  and similar or slightly reduced in women with Crohn's disease. Women who undergo ileal pouch anastomosis have reduced fertility. Fertility is likely worsened by disease activity but unaffected by medications used to treat IBD. Infertile patients with IBD respond as well as non-IBD patients to in vitro fertilization (IVF). Despite normal fertility, patients with IBD have fewer children due to concerns regarding infertility, disease inheritance, congenital abnormalities, and disease-related sexual dysfunction. Patients rarely discuss these issues with a physician. When discussion does occur, it may lead to changes in decision-making. Contraceptives are an important part of family planning, particularly during times of high disease activity. All forms of contraceptives are acceptable in patients with IBD, although there are specific considerations. The risks of combined oral contraceptives outweigh the benefits in patients with active disease and patients with prior or high risk for thromboembolism. Oral contraceptives and IBD are independently associated with an increased risk for thromboembolism, although it is not known whether this effect is compounding. Depot medroxyprogesterone  injection should be avoided in patients with or at risk for osteopenia. Intrauterine devices and implants are the most effective form of contraception and should be a first-line recommendation. The use of oral contraceptives is associated with the development of IBD, although there is no increased risk of disease relapse with the use of any form of contraceptive.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29423390>Dual Effects of High Protein Diet on Mouse Skin and Colonic Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation is a major etiology of cancer. Accumulating epidemiological and experimental evidences suggest that intake of high protein diet (HPD) is associated with -associated colon cancer, however, most of the studies were confined in colon. Systemic influence of HPD on inflammation indices in different tissues of an organism has never been studied. We therefore investigated the effect of HPD on mouse skin and colonic inflammation using the well characterized inflammation induction protocol in both tissues (12--tetradecanoylphorbol-13- [TPA] for skin and dextran sodium sulfate [DSS] for colon). ICR mice were grouped to normal diet (ND, 20% casein) or HPD (50% casein) groups. In each diet group, mice were treated with either vehicle (acetone or HO), TPA, TPA and DSS, or DSS. Experimental diet was fed for total 4 weeks. After 1 week of diet feeding, 6.5 nmol of TPA was topically applied twice a week for 2 weeks on the shaved mouse dorsal skin. Drinking water containing 2% DSS was administered for 7 days at the final week of experiment. The results showed that TPA-induced skin hyperplasia, epidermal cell proliferation, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression were reduced in HPD group compared to ND group. In contrast, HPD increased DSS-induced colon mucosal hyperplasia, colonocyte proliferation, COX-2 expression, and plasma nitric oxide compared to ND group. This suggests that HPD exerts differential effect on different tissue inflammation which implies efficacy of protein intervention to human also should be monitored more thoroughly.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30510995>Toll-Like Receptor 7 Agonist-Induced Dermatitis Causes Severe Dextran Sulfate Sodium  by Altering the Gut Microbiome and Immune Cells.</a></h2><p>Psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are both chronic inflammatory diseases occurring in the skin and gut, respectively. It is well established that psoriasis and IBD have high concordance rates, and similar changes in immune cells and microbiome composition have been reported in both conditions. To study this connection, we used a combination murine model of psoriatic dermatitis and  in which mice were treated topically with the Toll-like receptor 7 agonist imiquimod (IMQ) and fed dextran sulfate sodium (DSS).We applied IMQ topically to B6 mice (IMQ mice) and subsequently fed them 2% DSS in their drinking water. Disease activity and immune cell phenotypes were analyzed, and the microbial composition of fecal samples was investigated using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. We transplanted feces from IMQ mice to germ-free IQI/Jic (IQI) mice and fed them DSS to assess the effect of the gut microbiome on disease.We first confirmed that IMQ mice showed accelerated DSS . IMQ mice had decreased numbers of IgD and IgM B cells and increased numbers of non-cytokine-producing macrophages in the gut. Moreover, the gut microbiomes of IMQ mice were perturbed, with significant reductions of  and  populations. Germ-free mice transplanted with feces from IMQ mice, but not with feces from untreated mice, also developed exacerbated DSS .These results suggest that skin inflammation may contribute to pathogenic conditions in the gut via immunologic and microbiological changes.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are necessary to differentiate both species. The most common clinical presentations of E. histolytica disease are amebic  and amebic liver abscess, but asymptomatic infection is also possible. We assessed the frequency and pattern of clinical symptoms and microscopic features in travelers/migrants associated with E. histolytica intestinal infection and compared them to those found in individuals with E. dispar infection.We conducted a retrospective study at the travel clinic of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium on travelers/migrants found from 2006 to 2016 positive for Entamoeba histolytica/dispar through antigen detection and/or through microscopy confirmed by PCR. All files of individuals with a positive PCR for E. histolytica (= cases) and a random selection of an equal number of Entamoeba dispar carriers (= controls) were reviewed. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios (LRs) of clinical symptoms (blood in stool, mucus in stool, watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever or any of these 5 symptoms) and of microscopic features (presence of trophozoites in direct and in sodium -acetic acid-formalin (SAF)-fixed stool smears) to discriminate between E. histolytica and E. dispar infection.Of all stool samples positive for Entamoeba histolytica/dispar for which PCR was performed (n = 810), 30 (3.7%) were true E. histolytica infections, of which 39% were asymptomatic. Sensitivity, specificity and positive LRs were 30%, 100% and 300 (p 0.007) for presence of blood in stool; 22%, 100% and 222 (p 0.03) for mucus in stool; 44%, 90% and 4.7 (p 0.009) for cramps and 14%, 97% and 4.8 (p = 0.02) for trophozoites in direct smears. For watery diarrhea, fever and for trophozoites in SAF fixated smears results were non-significant.E. histolytica infection was demonstrated in a small proportion of travelers/migrants with evidence of Entamoeba histolytica/dispar infection.

However, the underlying mechanism of its anti-inflammatory effect is poorly understood.In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of EtOAc fractions of H. attenuatum Choisy (Ha-EtOAc) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 macrophage inflammation and hypothesized that Ha-EtOAc could attenuate inflammation in the colon.LPS was utilized to induce RAW264.7 cells inflammation. The anti-inflammatory effect of Ha-EtOAc in RAW264.7 cells was evaluated by measuring the inhibition ratio of nitric oxide (NO) production. Murine ulcerative  (UC) was induced by treatment with 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The basic indexes of the mice, including body weight, food intake and hematochezia, were recorded during mice experiments.The expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β, were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Additionally, the influences of Ha-EtOAc on the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways were determined by western blot and immunofluorescence assays. In addition, the impact of Ha-EtOAc on gut microbiota of mice with UC was detected by 16S rDNA sequencing.Ha-EtOAc inhibited the LPS-induced production of NO and decreased the release of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, pretreatment with Ha-EtOAc could suppress the nuclear translocation of p65 and the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, p38 and JNK. Ha-EtOAc treatment ameliorated murine UC, as reflected by a reduced body weight loss, improved colon shortening, alleviated mucosal damage and decreased releases of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, Ha-EtOAc could modulate the composition of microbial communities.Our results demonstrated that Ha-EtOAc exhibited anti-inflammatory effects mainly by suppressing the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, and Ha-EtOAc treatment may be a potent therapy for the treatment of ulcerative .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

MUC2 deficiency results in impaired epithelial barrier function, imbalance in gut microbiota, and spontaneous . Probiotics have been shown to have a protective effect against . In this study we used Muc2 mucin-deficient (Muc2) and Muc2 littermates to test whether the probiotic mixture VSL#3 requires an intact mucin barrier to exert its beneficial effect. VSL#3 alone reduced basal colonic proinflammatory cytokine levels and improved epithelial barrier function in Muc2 animals. Similarly, in dextran sulfate sodium-induced , VSL#3 dampened the proinflammatory chemokines KC, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and upregulated the tissue regeneration growth factors transforming growth factor-β, fibroblast growth factor-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor-A, which accelerated resolution of  symptoms in Muc2 animals. Importantly, improved colonic health in VSL#3-treated animals was associated with attenuated reactive oxygen species production by peritoneal macrophages, restoration of antimicrobial peptide gene expression in the small intestine, and increased abundance of bacterial commensals in the gut. The beneficial effects of VSL#3 in Muc2 animals were mediated by , an important short-chain fatty acid produced by gut bacteria. These studies provide evidence for the first time that VSL#3 can enhance epithelial barrier function by dampening the proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine response, accelerating restitution, and altering commensal microbiota in the absence of a functional mucus barrier.It is unclear whether probiotics require an intact mucin barrier to first colonize and/or exert their protective functions. In this study we used mucin-deficient (Muc2) mice to interrogate if the multispecies probiotic mixture VSL#3 could enhance epithelial barrier function. In the absence of a mucus bilayer, VSL#3 dampened proinflammatory and chemokine production, accelerated restitution, and markedly improved gut permeability mediated by the short-chain fatty acid  in the colon.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28842393>E6130, a Novel CX3C Chemokine Receptor 1 (CX3CR1) Modulator, Attenuates Mucosal Inflammation and Reduces CX3CR1 Leukocyte Trafficking in Mice with .</a></h2><p>The chemokine fractalkine (CX3C chemokine ligand 1; CX3CL1) and its receptor CX3CR1 are involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative , rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis, myositis, multiple sclerosis, renal ischemia, and atherosclerosis. There are no orally available agents that modulate the fractalkine/CX3CR1 axis. [(3,4)-1-[2-Chloro-6-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl]-3-{[1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-ylmethyl)piperidin-4-yl]carbamoyl}-4-methylpyrrolidin-3-yl]acetic acid (2S)-hydroxy(phenyl) (E6130) is an orally available highly selective modulator of CX3CR1 that may be effective for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. We found that E6130 inhibited the fractalkine-induced chemotaxis of human peripheral blood natural killer cells (IC 4.9 nM), most likely via E6130-induced down-regulation of CX3CR1 on the cell surface. E6130 had agonistic activity via CX3CR1 with respect to guanosine 5'-3--(thio)triphosphate binding in CX3CR1-expressing Chinese hamster ovary K1 (CHO-K1) membrane and had no antagonistic activity. Orally administered E6130 ameliorated several inflammatory bowel disease-related parameters in a murine CD4CD45RB T-cell-transfer  model and a murine oxazolone-induced  model. In the CD4CD45RB T-cell transfer model, E6130 inhibited the migration of CX3CR1 immune cells and decreased the number of these cells in the gut mucosal membrane. These results suggest that E6130 is a promising therapeutic agent for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2017 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26809801>Potassium  Blocks Clostridium difficile Toxin A-Induced Microtubule Disassembly by Directly Inhibiting Histone Deacetylase 6, Thereby Ameliorating Inflammatory Responses in the Gut.</a></h2><p>Clostridium difficile toxin A is known to cause deacetylation of tubulin proteins, which blocks microtubule formation and triggers barrier dysfunction in the gut. Based on our previous finding that the Clostridium difficile toxin A-dependent activation of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC-6) is responsible for tubulin deacetylation and subsequent microtubule disassembly, we herein examined the possible effect of potassium  (PA; whose acetyl group prevents the binding of tubulin to HDAC-6) as a competitive/false substrate. Our results revealed that PA inhibited toxin A-induced deacetylation of tubulin and recovered toxin A-induced microtubule disassembly. In addition, PA treatment significantly decreased the production of IL-6 (a marker of inflamed tissue) in the toxin A-induced mouse enteritis model. An in vitro HDAC assay revealed that PA directly inhibited HDAC-6-mediated tubulin deacetylation, indicating that PA acted as a false substrate for HDAC-6. These results collectively indicate that PA treatment inhibits HDAC-6, thereby reducing the cytotoxicity and inflammatory responses caused by C. difficile toxin A.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707247>Toxicity of hydrogen sulfide toward sulfate-reducing bacteria Desulfovibrio piger Vib-7.</a></h2><p>Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) belonging to the intestinal microbiota are the main producers of hydrogen sulfide and their increasing amount due to the accumulation of this compound in the bowel are involved in the initiation and maintenance of inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this experiment is to study the relative toxicity of hydrogen sulfide and survival of Desulfovibrio piger Vib-7 through monitoring: sulfate reduction parameters (sulfate consumption, hydrogen sulfide production, lactate consumption and  production) and kinetic parameters of these processes. The research is highlighting the survival of intestinal SRB, D. piger Vib-7 under the influence of different hydrogen sulfide concentrations (1-7 mM). The highest toxicity of HS was measured in the presence of concentrations higher than 6 mM, where growing was stopped, though metabolic activities were not 100% inhibited. These findings are confirmed by cross correlation and principal component analysis that clearly supported the above mentioned results. The kinetic parameters of bacterial growth and sulfate reduction were inhibited proportionally with increasing HS concentration. The presence of 5 mM HS resulted in two times longer lag phase and generation time was eight times longer. Maximum rate of growth and hydrogen production was stopped under 4 mM, emphasizing the HS toxicity concentrations to be < 4 mM, even for sulfide producing bacteria such as Desulfovibrio. The results are confirming HS concentrations toxicity toward Desulfovibrio, especially the study novelty should be emphasized where it was found that the exact HS limits (> 4 mM) toward this bacterial strain inhabiting humans and animals intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25841250>White and dark kidney beans reduce colonic mucosal damage and inflammation in response to dextran sodium sulfate.</a></h2><p>Common beans are a rich source of nondigestible fermentable components and phenolic compounds that have anti-inflammatory effects. We assessed the gut-health-promoting potential of kidney beans in healthy mice and their ability to attenuate colonic inflammation following dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) exposure (via drinking water, 2% DSS w/v, 7 days). C57BL/6 mice were fed one of three isocaloric diets: basal diet control (BD), or BD supplemented with 20% cooked white (WK) or dark red kidney (DK) bean flour for 3 weeks. In healthy mice, anti-inflammatory microbial-derived cecal short chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels (, butyrate and propionate), colon crypt height and colonic Mucin 1 (MUC1) and Resistin-like Molecule beta (Relmβ) mRNA expression all increased in WK- and DK-fed mice compared to BD, indicative of enhanced microbial activity, gut barrier integrity and antimicrobial defense response. During , both bean diets reduced (a) disease severity, (b) colonic histological damage and (c) increased mRNA expression of antimicrobial and barrier integrity-promoting genes (Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4), MUC1-3, Relmβ and Trefoil Factor 3 (TFF3)) and reduced proinflammatory mediator expression [interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, interferon (IFN)γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1], which correlated with reduced colon tissue protein levels. Further, bean diets exerted a systemic anti-inflammatory effect during  by reducing serum levels of IL-17A, IFNγ, TNFα, IL-1β and IL-6. In conclusion, both WK and DK bean-supplemented diets enhanced microbial-derived SCFA metabolite production, gut barrier integrity and the microbial defensive response in the healthy colon, which supported an anti-inflammatory phenotype during . Collectively, these data demonstrate a beneficial colon-function priming effect of bean consumption that mitigates  severity.Crown Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We performed a comparative assessment of the capacity of the microbiota for butyrate synthesis, by quantifying butyryl-CoA: CoA-transferase [BCoAT] gene content in stool from patients with Crohn's disease [CD; n = 71], ulcerative  [UC; n = 58] and controls [n = 75], and determined whether it was related to active vs inactive inflammation, microbial diversity, and composition and/or dietary habits.BCoAT gene content was quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR]. Disease activity was assessed clinically and faecal calprotectin concentration measured. Microbial composition was determined by sequencing 16S rRNA gene. Dietary data were collected using an established food frequency questionnaire.Reduced butyrate-synthetic capacity was found in patients with active and inactive CD [p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively], but only in active UC [p < 0.05]. In CD, low BCoAT gene content was associated with ileal location, stenotic behaviour, increased inflammation, lower microbial diversity, greater microbiota compositional change, and decreased butyrogenic taxa. Reduced BCoAT gene content in patients with CD was linked with a different regimen characterised by lower dietary fibre.Reduced butyrate-synthetic capacity of the microbiota is more evident in CD than UC and may relate to reduced fibre intake. The results suggest that simple replacement of butyrate per se may be therapeutically inadequate, whereas manipulation of microbial synthesis, perhaps by dietary means, may be more appropriate.Copyright © 2017 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is increasingly considered to be causatively related to IBD and is strongly affected by components of a Western life style. Bacteria that ferment fibers and produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are typically reduced in mucosa and feces of patients with IBD, as compared to healthy individuals. SCFAs, such as , propionate and butyrate, are important metabolites in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Several studies have indeed shown that fecal SCFAs levels are reduced in active IBD. SCFAs are an important fuel for intestinal epithelial cells and are known to strengthen the gut barrier function. Recent findings, however, show that SCFAs, and in particular butyrate, also have important immunomodulatory functions. Absorption of SCFAs is facilitated by substrate transporters like MCT1 and SMCT1 to promote cellular metabolism. Moreover, SCFAs may signal through cell surface G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), like GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109A, to activate signaling cascades that control immune functions. Transgenic mouse models support the key role of these GPCRs in controlling intestinal inflammation. Here, we present an overview of microbial SCFAs production and their effects on the intestinal mucosa with specific emphasis on their relevance for IBD. Moreover, we discuss the therapeutic potential of SCFAs for IBD, either applied directly or by stimulating SCFAs-producing bacteria through pre- or probiotic approaches.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29357130>Short-Chain Fatty Acid Transporters: Role in Colonic Homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA; , propionate, and butyrate) are generated in colon by bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber. Though diffusion in protonated form is a significant route, carrier-mediated mechanisms constitute the major route for the entry of SCFA in their anionic form into colonic epithelium. Several transport systems operate in cellular uptake of SCFA. MCT1 (SLC16A1) and MCT4 (SLC16A3) are H+-coupled and mediate electroneutral transport of SCFA (H+: SCFA stoichiometry; 1:1). MCT1 is expressed both in the apical membrane and basolateral membrane of colonic epithelium whereas MCT4 specifically in the basolateral membrane. SMCT1 (SLC5A8) and SMCT2 (SLC5A12) are Na+-coupled; SMCT1-mediated transport is electrogenic (Na+: SCFA stoichiometry; 2:1) whereas SMCT2-mediated transport is electroneutral (Na+: SCFA stoichiometry; 1:1). SMCT1 and SMCT2 are expressed exclusively in the apical membrane. An anion-exchange mechanism also operates in the apical membrane in which SCFA entry in anionic form is coupled to bicarbonate efflux; the molecular identity of this exchanger however remains unknown. All these transporters are subject to regulation, notably by their substrates themselves; this process involves cell-surface receptors with SCFA as signaling molecules. There are significant alterations in the expression of these transporters in ulcerative  and colon cancer. The tumor-associated changes occur via transcriptional regulation by p53 and HIF1α and by promoter methylation. As SCFA are obligatory for optimal colonic health, the transporters responsible for the entry and transcellular transfer of these bacterial products in colonic epithelium are critical determinants of colonic function under physiological conditions and in disease states. © 2018 American Physiological Society.

These receptors are activated by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as , propionate, and butyrate - which are produced during dietary fiber fermentation by resident gut bacteria. This unique ligand specificity suggests that GPR41 and GPR43 may mediate the interaction between the human host and the gut microbiome. Indeed, studies on knockout mice implicate GPR41 and GPR43 in chronic inflammatory disorders such as obesity, , asthma and arthritis. However, whether GPR41 and GPR43 are protective or causative is inconsistent between studies. This discrepancy may be due to differences in the disease models used, the inbred mouse strains, or non-specific knockout effects. Here, we review the latest findings on GPR41 and GPR43, highlighting contradictory observations. With GPR41 and GPR43 being considered as drug targets, it is pertinent that their role is fully elucidated. We propose that future studies on human tissues, ex vivo, may allow us to confirm the role of GPR41 and GPR43 in humans, be it protective or causative.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28812431>Oral administration of curcumin attenuates visceral hyperalgesia through inhibiting phosphorylation of TRPV1 in rat model of ulcerative .</a></h2><p>Background Curcumin has been reported to have anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects. The present study was designed to explore the potential therapeutic effects of curcumin on visceral hyperalgesia and inflammation in a rat model of ulcerative . We observed the effects of orally administered curcumin on the disease activity index, histological change in colon, colorectal distension-induced abdominal withdrawal reflex, the expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and phosphorylated TRPV1 in dextran sulfate sodium-induced  rats. In addition, a HEK293 cell line stably expressing human TRPV1 (hTRPV1) was used to examine the effects of curcumin on the change in membrane expression of TRPV1 induced by phorbol myristate  (a protein kinase C activator). Results Repeated oral administration of curcumin inhibited the increase in abdominal withdrawal reflex score induced by dextran sulfate sodium without affecting dextran sulfate sodium-induced histological change of colon and the disease activity index. A significant increase in colonic expression of TRPV1 and pTRPV1 was observed in dextran sulfate sodium-treated rats and this was reversed by oral administration of curcumin. TRPV1 expression in L6-S1 dorsal root ganglion was increased in the small- to medium-sized isolectin B4-positive non-peptidergic and calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive peptidergic neurons in dextran sulfate sodium-treated rats and oral administration of curcumin mitigated such changes. In the HEK293 cell line stably expressing hTRPV1, curcumin (1, 3 µm) inhibited phorbol myristate -induced upregulation of membrane TRPV1. Conclusion Oral administration of curcumin alleviates visceral hyperalgesia in dextran sulfate sodium-induced  rats. The anti-hyperalgesic effect is partially through downregulating the colonic expression and phosphorylation of TRPV1 on the afferent fibers projected from peptidergic and non-peptidergic nociceptive neurons of dorsal root ganglion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25633224>The short-chain fatty acid receptor GPR43 is transcriptionally regulated by XBP1 in human monocytes.</a></h2><p>G-protein coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) recognizes short chain fatty acids and is implicated in obesity, , asthma and arthritis. Here, we present the first full characterization of the GPR43 promoter and 5'-UTR. 5'-RACE of the GPR43 transcript identified the transcription start site (TSS) and a 124 bp 5'-UTR followed by a 1335 bp intron upstream of the ATG start codon. The sequence spanning -4560 to +68 bp relative to the GPR43 TSS was found to contain strong promoter activity, increasing luciferase reporter expression by >100-fold in U937 monocytes. Stepwise deletions further narrowed the putative GPR43 promoter (-451 to +68). Site-directed mutagenesis identified XBP1 as a core cis element, the mutation of which abrogated transcriptional activity. Mutations of predicted CREB, CHOP, NFAT and STAT5 binding sites, partially reduced promoter activity. ChIP assays confirmed the binding of XBP1 to the endogenous GPR43 promoter. Consistently, GPR43 expression is reduced in monocytes upon siRNA-knockdown of XBP1, while A549 cells overexpressing XBP1 displayed elevated GPR43 levels. Based on its ability to activate XBP1, we predicted and confirmed that TNFα induces GPR43 expression in human monocytes. Altogether, our findings form the basis for strategic modulation of GPR43 expression, with a view to regulate GPR43-associated diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30862015>Secondary Bile Acids and Short Chain Fatty Acids in the Colon: A Focus on Colonic Microbiome, Cell Proliferation, Inflammation, and Cancer.</a></h2><p>Secondary bile acids (BAs) and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), two major types of bacterial metabolites in the colon, cause opposing effects on colonic inflammation at chronically high physiological levels. Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol metabolism, lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs , propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer. This article reviews the current knowledge concerning the effects of secondary BAs and SCFAs on the proliferation of colon epithelial cells, inflammation, cancer, and the associated microbiome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27537052>Treatment with a Urokinase Receptor-derived Cyclized Peptide Improves Experimental  by Preventing Monocyte Recruitment and Macrophage Polarization.</a></h2><p>Leukocyte migration across the blood barrier and into tissues represents a key process in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. The urokinase receptor (urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor) is a master regulator of leukocyte recruitment. We recently found that cyclization of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor-derived peptide Ser-Arg-Ser-Arg-Tyr [SRSRY] inhibits transendothelial migration of monocytes. Now, we have explored the effects of [SRSRY] administration during experimental .The effects of [SRSRY] on cytokine profile, cytoskeletal organization, and cell migration were investigated using phorbol-12-myristate -differentiated THP-1 cells exposed to polarizing stimuli. In vivo, [SRSRY] was intraperitoneally administered during dextran sodium sulfate- or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced  in wild-type or urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor knockout mice. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory monocytes in mucosal infiltrates were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry, respectively.[SRSRY] prevents M0 to M1 transition and migration of M1 polarized macrophages. In vivo, [SRSRY] reduces intestinal inflammation diminishing body weight loss and disease activity index. These beneficial effects are accompanied by a reduction of interleukin 1β, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor α, an increase of interleukin 10, and an abridged recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to the inflamed tissue.Altogether, these findings indicate that [SRSRY] may be considered as a new drug useful for the pharmacological treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914354>Multidirectional biological investigation and phytochemical profile of Rubus sanctus and Rubus ibericus.</a></h2><p>In the present study, the biological properties, including, the enzyme inhibitory and antioxidant activities, as well as, the phytochemical profile of the ethyl , methanol, and water extracts of Rubus sanctus Schreb. and Rubus ibericus Juz. leaves were determined using in vitro bioassays.

Data collected from this study reported the radical scavenging and reducing potential of the studied Rubus species. Investigation of the protective effects of the different extracts of R. sanctus and R. ibericus in experimental model of ulcerative  was performed. The extracts were also tested on spontaneous migration of human colon cancer cells (HCT116) in wound healing experimental paradigm. Only R. sanctus methanol extract inhibited spontaneous HCT116 migration in the wound healing test.

We have demonstrated that in humans, inflammatory conditions that predispose to development of skin and colon tumors are associated with accumulation in tissues of CD33+S100A9+ cells, the phenotype typical for myeloid-derived suppressor cells in cancer or immature myeloid cells (IMCs) in tumor-free hosts. To identify the direct role of these cells in tumor development, we used S100A9 transgenic mice to create the conditions for topical accumulation of these cells in the skin in the absence of infection or tissue damage. These mice demonstrated accumulation of granulocytic IMCs in the skin upon topical application of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA), resulting in a dramatic increase in the formation of papillomas during epidermal carcinogenesis. The effect of IMCs on tumorigenesis was not associated with immune suppression, but with CCL4 (chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 4)-mediated recruitment of IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells. This chemokine was released by activated IMCs. Elimination of CD4+ T cells or blockade of CCL4 or IL-17 abrogated the increase in tumor formation caused by myeloid cells. Thus, this study implicates accumulation of IMCs as an initial step in facilitation of tumor formation, followed by the recruitment of CD4+ T cells.© 2015 Ortiz et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31254739>Flos Abelmoschus manihot extract attenuates DSS-induced  by regulating gut microbiota and Th17/Treg balance.</a></h2><p>Flos Abelmoschus manihot is widely used as traditional drug in China.

We found upregulated expression of CD4+CD29+T cells in both peripheral blood and colon from rats, and a similar trend for MPO and VCAM-1 in colon (P<0.05); the expression was especially enhanced in UC rats at two weeks after the model was established (P<0.01). Such upregulation was also indicated in active and remission UC patients as compared to the healthy and enteritis groups (P<0.05), with the highest expression level detected in the active UC patients (P<0.01). Pearson correlation analysis showed a positive correlation of CD4+CD29+T cells in rat and human peripheral blood with DAI score (rrat=0.712, rhuman=0.677, P<0.01), and MPO in colon (rrat=0.514, rhuman=0.682, P<0.05). These results suggest that CD4+CD29+T cells may act as major effector cell subsets in persistent inflammatory responses for UC and that infiltration into colon inflammation may be induced by the combination of VCAM-1 and CD29.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26173741>Hematopoietic plakophilin-3 regulates acute tissue-specific and systemic inflammation in mice.</a></h2><p>Plakophilin-3 (PKP3) is a member of the armadillo protein family, which is important in cell-cell contacts and signaling during development and tumorigenesis. In conventional facilities, PKP3-deficient mice (PKP3(-/-)) develop spontaneous dermatitis, indicating a possible involvement of PKP3 in inflammatory responses. Here, we show that PKP3 deficiency sensitizes mice to irritant contact dermatitis induced by phorbol myristate  (PMA). This sensitization occurred in mice with PKP3 deficiency in the hematopoietic system (PKP3(-/-hem)), but not if the deficiency was specific to skin keratinocytes (PKP3(-/-ker)). In a model of dextran sulfate sodium induced , ubiquitous PKP3 deletion, but not intestinal epithelial PKP3 deficiency (PKP3(-/-IEC)), impaired survival from disease. Interestingly, PKP3(-/-hem) mice also displayed increased sensitivity to dextran sulfate sodium induced . Finally, PKP3(-/-) mice were more sensitive to the lethality of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection than wild-type (WT) mice, and this phenotype was associated with increased intestinal permeability. PKP3(-/-IEC) mice did not reproduce the enhanced endotoxin reactivity of PKP3(-/-) mice, in contrast to PKP3(-/-hem) mice. Finally, in vitro stimulation of WT neutrophils with LPS or PMA increased Pkp3 expression. In conclusion, our data highlight a novel role for hematopoietic PKP3 in the regulation of both locally and systemically induced immune responses. Nonetheless, further research is needed to unravel the underlying mechanism.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Emerging studies have demonstrated that Genistein, a major isoflavone, has potential anti-inflammatory effects in murine model . However, its anti-inflammatory mechanism remains unclear. The effects of Genistein in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine  via targeting NLRP3 inflammasome was investigated in this study. Also, the mechanisms of protective action of Genistein in DSS-induced  may relate to TGR5 signaling. Genistein treatment not only remarkably attenuated loss of body weight and shortening of colon length but also significantly reduced inflammatory cells infiltration and pro-inflammatory mediator production in serum and colon. Moreover, Genistein treatment down-regulated production of caspase-1 and IL-1β and increased intracellular cAMP level, which were similar to the treatment for INT-777, a semi-synthetic TGR5 agonist, in phorbol myristate  (PMA)-differentiated monocytic THP-1 cells and U937 cells. These protective effects of Genistein might be attributed by ubiquination of NLRP3 which was induced due to interaction of cAMP with NLRP3. Furthermore, the effects of Genistein on NLRP3 inflammasome disappeared in TGR5-silenced U937 cells. In conclusion, our study unveils that Genistein was able to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome via TGR5-cAMP signaling in macrophages. It therefore might be a potential effective drug for inflammatory bowel diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Analysis of fecal samples from untreated amebic liver abscess (ALA) patients, Entamoeba histolytica (Eh)-negative and -positive asymptomatic individuals, and pus samples from naive ALA patients revealed a significant reduction in Lactobacillus in asymptomatic individuals (Eh +ve) and ALA patients. Two anaerobic genera, namely Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus, were detected in naive ALA pus samples. Analysis of fecal samples from amoebic  patients showed a significant decline in population of Bacteroides, Clostridium coccoides and leptum subgroup, Lactobacillus, Campylobacter, and Eubacterium, whereas a significant increase in Bifidobacterium was observed. Mucosa-associated bacterial flora analysis from IBD patients and healthy controls revealed a significant difference in concentration of bacteria among predominating and subdominating genera between ulcerative  (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and controls. In contrast to the mucosal studies, we found a significant increase in lactobacilli population in fecal samples of active UC patients. Another study revealed a significant decrease of Clostridium coccoides and leptum clusters in fecal samples of active UC patients along with decreased concentrations of fecal SCFAs, especially of n-butyrate, iso-butyrate, and .

Suppression of MALT1 protease activity with small molecule inhibitors showed promising efficacies in subtypes of B cell lymphoma and improvement in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model. However, whether MALT1 inhibitors could ameliorate  remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the pharmacological effect of two specific MALT1 inhibitors MI-2 and mepazine on the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental  in mice, followed by mechanistic analysis on NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Treatment with MI-2 and mepazine dose-dependently attenuated symptoms of  in mice, evidenced by reduction in the elevated disease activity index, the shortening of colon length as well as the histopathologic improvement. Moreover, protein and mRNA levels of DSS-induced proinflammatory cytokines in colon, including TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, IL-17A and IFN-γ, were markedly suppressed by MALT1 inhibitors. The underlying mechanisms for the protective effect of MALT1 inhibitors in DSS-induced  may be attributed to its inhibition on NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. The in vitro study showed that MALT1 inhibitors decreased production of IL-1β/IL-18 in phorbol myristate -differentiated THP-1 cells and bone marrow derived macrophage via suppressing the activation of NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome. Taken together, our results demonstrated that inhibition of the protease activity of MALT1 might be a viable strategy to treat inflammatory bowel disease and the NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB activation are critical components in MALT1 signaling cascades in this disease model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30889825>Decreased Protein Kinase C-β Type II Associated with the Prominent Endotoxin Exhaustion in the Macrophage of FcGRIIb-/- Lupus Prone Mice is Revealed by Phosphoproteomic Analysis.</a></h2><p>Dysfunction of FcGRIIb, the only inhibitory receptor of the FcGR family, is commonly found in the Asian population and is possibly responsible for the extreme endotoxin exhaustion in lupus. Here, the mechanisms of prominent endotoxin (LPS) tolerance in FcGRIIb-/- mice were explored on bone marrow-derived macrophages using phosphoproteomic analysis. As such, LPS tolerance decreased several phosphoproteins in the FcGRIIb-/- macrophage, including protein kinase C-β type II (PRKCB), which was associated with phagocytosis function. Overexpression of PRKCB attenuated LPS tolerance in RAW264.7 cells, supporting the role of this gene in LPS tolerance. In parallel, LPS tolerance in macrophages and in mice was attenuated by phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) administration. This treatment induced several protein kinase C families, including PRKCB. However, PMA attenuated the severity of mice with cecal ligation and puncture on LPS tolerance preconditioning in FcGRIIb-/- but not in wild-type cells. The significant reduction of PRKCB in the FcGRIIb-/- macrophage over wild-type cell possibly induced the more severe LPS-exhaustion and increased the infection susceptibility in FcGRIIb-/- mice. PMA induced PRKCB, improved LPS-tolerance, and attenuated sepsis severity, predominantly in FcGRIIb-/- mice. PRKCB enhancement might be a promising strategy to improve macrophage functions in lupus patients with LPS-tolerance from chronic infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26852904>Safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of GLPG0974, a potent and selective FFA2 antagonist, in healthy male subjects.</a></h2><p>Free fatty acids (FFA) can act as direct signalling molecules through activation of several membrane-bound G-protein coupled receptors. The FFA2 receptor (known as GPR43) is activated by short chain fatty acids (SCFA) such as  and has been shown to play a major role in SCFA-induced neutrophil activation and migration and to contribute in the development and control of inflammation. GLPG0974 is a potent and selective antagonist of the human FFA2. The main objectives of the two phase 1 trials were to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of GLPG0974.Two consecutive randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single centre trials in healthy subjects were performed. In the first, GLPG0974 was administered as single doses up to 250 mg and in the second, multiple daily doses up to 400 mg for 14 days were evaluated. Non-compartmental analysis was used to determine GLPG0974 pharmacokinetics while target engagement was investigated through the inhibition of neutrophils in -simulated whole blood samples using surface expression of CD11b activated epitope as a marker of neutrophil activation.The investigation of safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics in the early development phase showed that GLPG0974 was safe and well tolerated up to a daily dose of 400 mg. GLPG0974 showed good and dose proportional exposure up to 400 mg daily as well as a substantial and sustained inhibition of -stimulated neutrophil activation.Based on these results, a proof-of-concept study was initiated to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of GLPG0974 in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative .© 2016 Galapagos SASU / Galapagos NV.

The aim was to provide a new treatment method for , especially for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients. Since the simple oral gavage of CIN-102 was not able to reduce the pathogenic bacteria involved in  (rat model), the drug was incorporated into multiparticulates. The idea was to minimize undesired drug release in the upper gastrointestinal tract and to control CIN-102 release in the colon, in order to optimize the resulting antibiotic concentration at the site of action. A particular challenge was the fact that CIN-102 is a volatile hydrophobic liquid. Pellet cores were prepared by extrusion-spheronization and coated with polymer blends, which are sensitive to colonic bacterial enzymes. Mini-tablets were prepared by direct compression. The release of the main compound of CIN-102 (cinnamaldehyde, 86.7% w/w) was monitored in vitro. Optimized coated pellets and mini-tablets were also tested in vivo: in seven-week-old, male mice suffering from dextran sodium sulfate induced . Importantly, both types of multiparticulates were able: (i) to significantly reduce the number of luminal and mucosal enterobacteria in the mice (the levels of which are increased in the disease state), and (ii) to improve the clinical course of the intestinal inflammation (decrease in the percentages of mice with bloody stools and diarrhea).

A major metabolic product of commensal bacteria are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that derive from fermentation of dietary fibre. Here we show that diets deficient or low in fibre exacerbate  development, while very high intake of dietary fibre or the SCFA  protects against . SCFAs binding to the 'metabolite-sensing' receptors GPR43 and GPR109A in non-haematopoietic cells mediate these protective effects. The inflammasome pathway has hitherto been reported as a principal pathway promoting gut epithelial integrity. SCFAs binding to GPR43 on colonic epithelial cells stimulates K(+) efflux and hyperpolarization, which lead to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Dietary fibre also shapes gut bacterial ecology, resulting in bacterial species that are more effective for inflammasome activation. SCFAs and metabolite receptors thus explain health benefits of dietary fibre, and how metabolite signals feed through to a major pathway for gut homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498864>Systematic Review and Meta-analysis: Short-Chain Fatty Acid Characterization in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Alterations in gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been reported in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the results are conflicting.

Acute  was induced in C57BL/6 mice by administration of dextran sulfate sodium in the drinking water for 5 days. From day 6, mice were fasted for 36 h and refed normal bait, glucose powder, or lactylated high-amylose starch.

RA has been reported to be an effective treatment for allergy, diabetes, thrombosis, liver steatosis, lung fibrosis and . In addition, RA effectively inhibits tumor growth and induces apoptosis; however, the effects of RA, at non-cytotoxic doses, on the metastasis and angiogenesis of malignant cancer cells have, to be the best of our knowledge, not been identified. In the present study, it was identified that RA suppressed the metastatic potential of MDA‑MB231 breast cancer cells, including colony formation, migration and invasion. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with RA exhibited a decreased ability to form tube-like networks and to migrate across a Transwell membrane, when compared with RA‑untreated HUVECs. Using the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, RA treatment significantly suppressed spontaneous and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis. Furthermore, RA inhibited the production of pro-angiogenic factors, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, pentraxin‑3, interleukin-8, VEGF and placental growth factor under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and suppressed the phorbol 12-myristate 13--induced increase in the gelatinolytic MMP‑9 activity and MMP‑9 expression in HT1080 cells. RA also significantly inhibited the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α pathway, leading to decreased HIF‑1α accumulation and HIF‑1α nuclear expression under hypoxia. These results indicated that RA exhibits potent anti‑metastatic and anti‑angiogenic activities with no cytotoxicity via suppression of the HIF‑1α signaling pathway.

Shiga toxins (Stxs) are the main virulence factor of EHEC. The antagonistic effect of a prophylactic treatment with the probiotic strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae against EHEC O157:H7 was investigated using complementary in vitro human colonic model and in vivo murine ileal loop assays. In vitro, the probiotic treatment had no effect on O157:H7 survival but favorably influenced gut microbiota activity through modulation of short-chain fatty acid production, increasing  production and decreasing that of butyrate. Both pathogen and probiotic strains had individual-dependent effects on human gut microbiota. For the first time, stx expression was followed in human colonic environment: at 9 and 12 h post EHEC infection, probiotic treatment significantly decreased stx mRNA levels. Besides, in murine ileal loops, the probiotic yeast specifically exerted a trophic effect on intestinal mucosa and inhibited O157:H7 interactions with Peyer's patches and subsequent hemorrhagic lesions. Taken together, the results suggest that S. cerevisiae may be useful in the fight against EHEC infection and that host associated factors such as microbiota could influence clinical evolution of EHEC infection and the effectiveness of probiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26101138>Lactate and short chain fatty acids produced by microbial fermentation downregulate proinflammatory responses in intestinal epithelial cells and myeloid cells.</a></h2><p>The use of short chain fatty acids to modulate gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative  has produced encouraging results either in animal models or also in clinical trials. Identifying the key cellular and molecular targets of this activity will contribute to establish the appropriate combinations/targeting strategies to maximize the efficacy of anti-inflammatory interventions. In the present work, we evaluated in vitro the interaction of lactate, , propionate and butyrate on cells relevant for innate immune response of the gastrointestinal tract. All molecules tested regulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines by TLR-4 and TLR-5 activated intestinal epithelial cells in a dose response manner. Furthermore SCFAs and lactate modulate cytokine secretion of TLR-activated bone marrow derived macrophages and also TLR-dependent CD40 upregulation in bone marrow derived dendritic in a dose-dependent manner. Butyrate and propionate have been effective at concentrations of 1 to 5mM whereas  and lactate produced modulatory effects at concentrations higher than 20-50mM in different assays. Our results indicate that in concentrations similar to found in large bowel lumen, all SCFAs tested and lactate can modulate activity of relevant sentinel cell types activated by TLR signals. Modulatory activity was not inhibited by pertussis toxin treatment indicating that the effects are not related to Gi signaling.

The association of high CD161 expression with innate T-cell populations including MAIT cells is established. Here we show that CD161 is also expressed, at intermediate levels, on a prominent subset of polyclonal CD8+ T cells, including antiviral populations that display a memory phenotype. These memory CD161(int)CD8+ T cells are enriched within the colon and express both CD103 and CD69, markers associated with tissue residence. Furthermore, this population was characterized by enhanced polyfunctionality, increased levels of cytotoxic mediators, and high expression of the transcription factors T-bet and eomesodermin (EOMES). Such populations were induced by novel vaccine strategies based on adenoviral vectors, currently in trial against hepatitis C virus. Thus, intermediate CD161 expression marks potent polyclonal, polyfunctional tissue-homing CD8+ T-cell populations in humans.

Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a crucial event promoting malignant transformation, is regulated by inflammation and Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) plays an important role in this process. Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, was shown to prevent colonic tumors in different settings. We recently found that an extra-pure formulation of EPA as Free Fatty Acid (EPA-FFA) protects from colon cancer development in a mouse model of -Associated Cancer (CAC) through modulation of NOTCH1 signalling. In this study, we exposed colon cancer cells to an inflammatory stimulus represented by a cytokine-enriched Conditioned Medium (CM), obtained from THP1-differentiated macrophages. We found, for the first time, that CM strongly up-regulated NOTCH1 signalling and EMT markers, leading to increased invasiveness. Importantly, NOTCH1 signalling was dependent on MMP9 activity, upon CM exposure. We show that a non-cytotoxic pre-treatment with EPA-FFA antagonizes the effect of inflammation on NOTCH1 signalling, with reduction of MMP9 activity and invasiveness. In conclusion, our data suggest that, in CRC cells, inflammation induces NOTCH1 activity through MMP9 up-regulation and that this mechanism can be counteracted by EPA-FFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27117102>DNA damage and apoptosis in blood neutrophils of inflammatory bowel disease patients and in Caco-2 cells in vitro exposed to betanin.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and continuing colonic inflammation is considered an important risk factor in the development of colorectal cancer. Our previous studies showed that beetroot (Beta vulgaris var. rubra) products and their major component betanin modulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13- (TPA) stimulated human polymorphonuclear neutrophils of healthy volunteers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of betanin on the oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis in neutrophils isolated from blood of patients with inflammatory bowel disease--ulcerative  (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The results were compared with those obtained in colon carcinoma-derived Caco-2 cells. Betanin treatment at the concentration of 100 μM for 24 h increased DNA damage assessed by comet assay in IBD patients' neutrophils. A similar effect although less pronounced was observed in Caco-2 cells. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with H2O2 caused a 4-fold increase of DNA strand breaks in comparison to untreated cells, but pre-treatment with betanin reduced DNA damage in these cells. Betanin also induced procaspase-3 cleavage and caspase-3 activity accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, indicating its pro-apoptotic activity. These results suggest that betanin may support mechanisms that lead to the release of ROS and apoptotic cell death. In this way betanin may exert anti-inflammatory and potentially cancer preventive activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25284342>Arctigenin but not arctiin acts as the major effective constituent of Arctium lappa L. fruit for attenuating colonic inflammatory response induced by dextran sulfate sodium in mice.</a></h2><p>The crude powder of the fruit of Arctium lappa L. (ALF) has previously been reported to attenuate experimental  in mice. But, its main effective ingredient and underlying mechanisms remain to be identified. In this study, ALF was extracted with ethanol, and then successively fractionated into petroleum ether, ethyl , n-butanol and water fraction. Experimental  was induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice. Among the four fractions of ALF, the ethyl  fraction showed the most significant inhibition of DSS-induced  in mice. The comparative studies of arctigenin and arctiin (the two main ingredients of ethyl  fraction) indicated that arctigenin rather than arctiin could reduce the loss of body weight, disease activity index and histological damage in the colon. Arctigenin markedly recovered the loss of intestinal epithelial cells (E-cadherin-positive cells) and decreased the infiltration of neutrophils (MPO-positive cells) and macrophages (CD68-positive cells). Arctigenin could down-regulate the expressions of TNF-α, IL-6, MIP-2, MCP-1, MAdCAM-1, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 at both protein and mRNA levels in colonic tissues. Also, it markedly decreased the MDA level, but increased SOD activity and the GSH level. Of note, the efficacy of arctigenin was comparable or even superior to that of the positive control mesalazine. Moreover, it significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of MAPKs and the activation of NF-κB, including phosphorylation of IκBα and p65, p65 translocation and DNA binding activity. In conclusion, arctigenin but not arctiin is the main active ingredient of ALF for attenuating  via down-regulating the activation of MAPK and NF-κB pathways.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the correlation with human biology is uncertain. Here, we detected FFAR2 and FFAR3 expression in human monocytes via immunohistochemistry. Upon treatment with  SCFA or FFAR2- and FFAR3-specific synthetic agonists, human monocytes displayed elevated p38 phosphorylation and attenuated C5, CCL1, CCL2, GM-CSF, IL-1α, IL-1β and ICAM-1 inflammatory cytokine expression.  and FFAR2 agonist treatment also repressed Akt and ERK2 signalling. Surprisingly, mouse monocytes displayed a distinct response to  treatment, elevating GM-CSF, IL-1α, and IL-1β cytokine expression. This effect persisted in FFAR2/3-knockout mouse monocytes and was not reproduced by synthetic agonists, suggesting a FFAR2/3 independent mechanism in mice. Collectively, we show that SCFAs act via FFAR2/3 to modulate human monocyte inflammatory responses- a pathway that is absent in mouse monocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554064>Comprehensive approaches on the chemical constituents and pharmacological properties of flowers and leaves of American basil (Ocimum americanum L).</a></h2><p>Ocimum americanum L. (Lamiaceae) is a common food condiment and also used in traditional medicine in the management of several human diseases. Nonetheless, there has been no effort to delineate the biological and phytochemical profiles of leaves and flowers prepared by different extractive solvents (ethyl , methanol (MeOH), and water). The pharmacological potential of O. americanum extracts on pro-oxidant/pro-inflammatory mediators in rat colon specimens treated with lipopolysaccharide was investigated. In parallel, the inhibitory effects of the extracts on fungal and bacterial strains involved in ulcerative  were studied. Qualitative phytochemical analysis showed the presence of phenols, flavonoids, and tannins. Water extracts of flowers and leaves showed strong reducing and radicals scavenging potential. Both MeOH and ethyl  extracts of the leaves and flowers were able to inhibit acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and tyrosinase. All the extracts inhibited the selected bacterial and fungal strains, while only ethyl  flower extract displayed antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effects in rat colon. The water and MeOH extracts stimulated colon lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and serotonin (5-HT) and induced spontaneous migration of HCT116 cells. Future investigations should focus on the biological activity of isolated phytochemicals from the leaves and flowers of O. americanum, in order to clarify the mechanism(s) of action substantiating the observed pharmacological properties.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the anti-inflammatory mechanism of wogonoside has not been fully elucidated. Recently, NLRP3 inflammasome has been reported to be correlated with inflammatory bowel disease for its ability to induce IL-1β release. Nevertheless, there are few drug candidates targeting NLRP3 inflammasome for this disease. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of wogonoside in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine  and further revealed the underlying mechanisms by targeting NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome. Wogonoside treatment dose-dependently attenuated DSS-induced body weight loss and colon length shortening. Moreover, wogonoside prevented DSS-induced colonic pathological damage, remarkably inhibited inflammatory cells infiltration and significantly decreased myeloperoxidase (MPO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activities. The production of pro-inflammatory mediators in serum and colon was also significantly reduced by wogonoside. The underlying mechanisms for the protective effect of wogonoside in DSS-induced  may be attributed to its inhibition on NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in colons. Furthermore, wogonoside markedly decreased production of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 and suppressed mRNA expression of pro-IL-1β and NLRP3 in phorbol myristate  (PMA)-differentiated monocytic THP-1 cells via inhibiting the activation of NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that wogonoside may exert its anti-inflammatory effect via dual inhibition of NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome, suggesting that wogonoside might be a potential effective drug for inflammatory bowel diseases.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

One of them is frankincense. This traditional medicine of the East is believed to have anti-inflammatory, expectorant, antiseptic, and even anxiolytic and anti-neurotic effects. The present study aims to verify the reported therapeutic properties of Boswellia resin and describe its chemical composition based on available scientific studies. The main component of frankincense is oil (60%). It contains mono- (13%) and diterpenes (40%) as well as ethyl  (21.4%), octyl  (13.4%) and methylanisole (7.6%). The highest biological activity among terpenes is characteristic of 11-keto-ß-acetyl-beta-boswellic acid, acetyl-11-keto-ß-boswellic acid and acetyl-α-boswellic acid. Contemporary studies have shown that resin indeed has an analgesic, tranquilising and anti-bacterial effects. From the point of view of therapeutic properties, extracts from Boswellia serrata and Boswellia carterii are reported to be particularly useful. They reduce inflammatory conditions in the course of rheumatism by inhibiting leukocyte elastase and degrading glycosaminoglycans. Boswellia preparations inhibit 5-lipoxygenase and prevent the release of leukotrienes, thus having an anti-inflammatory effect in ulcerative , irritable bowel syndrome, bronchitis and sinusitis. Inhalation and consumption of Boswellia olibanum reduces the risk of asthma. In addition, boswellic acids have an antiproliferative effect on tumours. They inhibit proliferation of tumour cells of the leukaemia and glioblastoma subset. They have an anti-tumour effect since they inhibit topoisomerase I and II-alpha and stimulate programmed cell death (apoptosis).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27309769>Protective effect of Periplaneta americana extract in ulcerative  rats induced by dinitrochlorobenzene and acetic acid.</a></h2><p>Periplaneta americana L. (Dictyoptera; Blattaria) has been traditional used to treat ulcers, burns and heart disease in southwestern China. Recent reports indicate that P. americana can be used as an alternative medicine in therapy of ulcerative , but the mechanism involved remains obscure.This study investigated the therapeutic effect of P. americana extract (PAE) in rat  and elucidated its potential mechanism.Dinitrochlorobenzene and acetic acid-induced  rat model was applied.  rats were treated with PAE for 10 d and estimated disease activity index daily. Rectal inflammation was assessed by myeloperoxidase activity and histological changes. Another  rats were treated with PAE for 4 d, meanwhile gavage with Escherichia coli labelled with green fluorescent protein. Mesenteric lymph nodes, colon, liver, spleen and kidney were harvested for bacteria culture. PAE was suspended in distilled water then partitioned with ethyl  and n-butanol to obtain ethyl  fraction, n-butanol fraction and water fraction, respectively. Fibroblasts proliferation and collagen accumulation of each fraction was determined.PAE treatment reduced the severity of  and tissue myeloperoxidase accumulation (p < 0.001). Also, PAE at 80 mg/kg significantly inhibited labelled E. coli from translocating to distant organs, especially to MLN and liver. Additionally, PAE significantly stimulated fibroblasts proliferation (126.9%) and collagen accumulation (130.8%) for 48 h incubation. Among the partitions, ethyl  fraction generally had higher fibroblast viability enhanced-activity.PAE can protect against ulcerative  and this protection is attributed to anti-inflammation and fibroblasts viability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31211831>Intestinal Inflammation Modulates the Epithelial Response to Butyrate in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Butyrate-producing gut bacteria are reduced in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), supporting the hypothesis that butyrate supplementation may be beneficial in this setting. Nonetheless, earlier studies suggest that the oxidation of butyrate in IBD patients is altered. We propose that inflammation may decrease epithelial butyrate consumption.Non-IBD controls and IBD patients were recruited for the study. Stool samples were used for short-chain fatty acid and bacterial butyryl CoA: CoA-transferase quantification. Colonic biopsies and ex vivo differentiated epithelial organoids (d-EpOCs) treated with butyrate and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) were used for analyzing the expression of transporters MCT1 and ABCG2, metabolic enzyme ACADS, and butyrate receptor GPR43, and for butyrate metabolism and consumption assays.We observed that lower stool content of butyrate-producing bacteria in active IBD patients did not correlate with decreased butyrate concentrations. Indeed, the intestinal epithelial expression of MCT1, ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 was altered in active IBD patients. Nonetheless, d-EpOCs derived from IBD patients showed SLC16A1 (gene encoding for MCT1 protein), ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 expression levels comparable to controls. Moreover, IBD- and non-IBD-derived d-EpOCs responded similarly to butyrate, as assessed by transcriptional regulation. TNFα significantly altered SLC16A1, ABCG2, and GPR43 transcription in d-EpOCs, mimicking the expression profile observed in biopsies from active IBD patients and resulting in reduced butyrate consumption.We provide evidence that the response to butyrate is not intrinsically altered in IBD patients. However, TNFα renders the epithelium less responsive to this metabolite, defeating the purpose of butyrate supplementation during active inflammation.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

Taxonomic profiling was performed by aligning the reeds, not maped on hg19, on MetaPhlAn2 reference database. Reeds were mapped using the HUNAnN2 algorithm to the ChocoPhlAn database to assess the representation of microbial metabolic pathways. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) level were measured in fecal samples by gas-liquid chromatographic analysis.Changes in IBD patients gut microbiota were characterized by an increase in the representation of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla bacteria and decrease in the number of Firmicutes phylum bacteria and Euryarchaeota phylum archaea; a decrease in the alpha-diversity index, relative representation of butyrate-producing, hydrogen-utilizing bacteria, and Methanobrevibacter smithii; increase in the relative representation of Ruminococcus gnavus in UC and CD patients and Akkermansia muciniphila in CD patients. Reduction of Butyryl-CoA:  CoA transferase gene relative representation in CD patients, decrease of absolute content of SCFA total number as well as particular SCFAs and main SCFAs ratio in IBD patients may indicate inhibition of functional activity and number of anaerobic microflora and/or an change in SCFA utilization by colonocytes.the revealed changes can be considered as typical signs of dysbiosis in IBD patients and can be used as potential targets for IBD patients personalized treatment development.</p></html>
