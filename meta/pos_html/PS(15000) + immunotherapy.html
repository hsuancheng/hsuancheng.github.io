Prognostic and predictive factors are a high need.Retrospective review of NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab was performed. Analyzed variables included age, sex, stage, performance status (), location of metastases, presence of tumour-related symptoms and comorbidities, number of metastasis locations, previous chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic and radiotherapy treatments, and analytical data from the standard blood count and biochemistry.A total of 175 patients were included. Median age was 61.5 years, 73.1% were men, 77.7% were ECOG- -1, and 86.7% were included with stage IV disease. Histology was non-squamous in 77.1%. Sixty-five received nivolumab in second line (37.1%). Thirty-eight patients had brain metastasis (22%), and 39 (22.3%) liver metastasis and 126 (72%) had more than one metastatic location. The ORR was .7% with median Progression free survival (PFS) 2.8 months and median OS 5.81 months. Stage III vs IV and time since the beginning of the previous line of treatment ≥ 6 vs < 6 months were associated with better response.  2, time since the previous line of treatment < 6 vs ≥ 6 months, and more than one metastatic location were independently associated with shorter OS in multivariable analysis (7.8 vs 2.7 months, 11.2 vs 4.6 months, and 9.4 vs 5.1 month).

Metastatic disease responds poorly to currently available chemotherapy. Pyrazine diazohydroxide (PZDH) is a new agent inhibiting DNA synthesis that is active in mouse tumor models and human xenografts and lacks cross resistance with multiple standard agents. In this phase II trial, patients with no prior chemotherapy or  for metastatic disease and performance status (SWOG) of -1, were treated with pyrazine diazohydroxide at a dose of 100 mg/m2/day by i.v. bolus injection over 5- minutes for 5 consecutive days every 6 weeks. There were 23 eligible patients entered on this trial with 74% having  of  and 91% having visceral metastases. There were no confirmed anti-tumor responses. The overall response rate is % (95% CI %-%). Median overall survival is six months (95% CI 5-8 months). The most common toxicities were hematologic and consisted of lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and leukopenia. Fatigue. and nausea and vomiting were the next most common toxicities. Pyrazine diazohydroxide by this dose and schedule has insufficient activity in the treatment of disseminated malignant melanoma to warrant further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9164211>Superantigen-based : a phase I trial of PNU-214565, a monoclonal antibody-staphylococcal enterotoxin A recombinant fusion protein, in advanced pancreatic and colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>To establish the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and define the toxicities of a single-dose infusion of PNU-214565, a recombinant Escherichia coli-derived fusion protein of Staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) and the Fab-fragment of the C242 monoclonal antibody in patients with advanced colorectal and pancreatic carcinomas. To investigate the capability of PNU-214565 to induce a superantigen (SAg) response resulting in cytokine production and tumor regression.Twenty-one patients (age range, 39 to 76 years; median, 64; 12 men, nine women; 18 colorectal, three pancreatic cancers) were treated with a single 3-hour infusion of PNU-214565, with doses ranging from .01 to 1.5 ng/kg. All patients had prior chemotherapy and a good performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status [] =  [n = 10];  = 1 [n = 11]), 10 had prior radiation, and 18 had prior surgery.Fever and hypotension were the most common toxicities. Fever of any grade occurred in 16 of 21 patients (76%): four of 21 (19%) with grade 2 and two of 21 (9.5%) with grade 3. Hypotension of any grade occurred in 13 of 21 (62%): four of 21 with grade 2 and one of 21 (5%) with grade 3. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) induction correlated with toxicity. In the two patients with grade 3 fever, peak IL-2 and TNF alpha levels were 2.9 IU/mL and 165 pg/mL, and 8.3 IU/mL and 245 pg/mL, respectively. Transient, > or = 50% decreases in circulating monocytes were observed in 17 of 21 patients as early as .5 hours (median time, 2 hours) from the start of infusion. Decreases (mean 33%) in circulating lymphocytes were observed in seven of 21 patients. All three patients with grade 3 toxicity were treated at the .5-ng/kg dose. The significance of baseline anti-SEA, human antimouse antibody (HAMA), CA242-soluble antigen levels, and T-cell receptor variable beta region (TCR V beta) subsets and histocompatibility leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) genotypes was assessed as possible predictors of toxicity. All toxicities were transient and easily managed. No grade 3 toxicity occurred at the higher dose levels.PNU-214565, a SAg-based tumor targeted therapy, is safe when given as a single 3-hour infusion at doses up to 1.5 ng/kg. The MTD for a single dose was not determined. The safety of a repeated dose schedule is currently under investigation, beginning with doses determined to be safe in this trial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29478735>Atezolizumab in Platinum-treated Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma: Clinical Experience from an Expanded Access Study in the United States.</a></h2><p>Atezolizumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1) was approved in the USA, Europe, and elsewhere for treatment-naive and platinum-treated locally advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC).To report efficacy and safety from an atezolizumab expanded access study.This single-arm, open-label study enrolled 218 patients at 36 US sites. Key eligibility criteria included progression during/following ≥1 platinum-based chemotherapy for mUC or in perioperative setting (progression within 12 mo) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG ) -2.Patients received atezolizumab1200mg intravenously every 3 wk until loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, decision to discontinue, death, atezolizumab commercial availability, or study closure.Key end points reported herein included Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 objective response rate and duration, disease control rate (DCR; response or stable disease), and safety.All patients received prior systemic therapy (68% mUC; 27% adjuvant; and 26% neoadjuvant). At baseline, 57% of 214 treated patients had ECOG  ≥1, 19% had hemoglobin <10g/dl, and 25% had liver metastases. Median treatment duration was 9 wk (interquartile range [IQR], 6-12 wk). Median follow-up duration was 2.3 mo (IQR, 1.6-3.4 mo) overall and 2.7 mo (IQR, 2.-3.5 mo) in patients not known to have died. Seventeen of 114 evaluable patients (%) had objective responses (16 ongoing at study termination). DCR was 49%. Treatment-related adverse events (mostly fatigue) occurred in 98 of 214 treated patients.The benefit/risk profile of atezolizumab was consistent with that observed in previous studies, despite pretreatment and poor prognostic factors. These results suggest a potential role for atezolizumab in a broader patient range than typically eligible for phase 1-3 studies.In this expanded access study, atezolizumab was active and tolerable in a range of patients with platinum-treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma.Copyright © 2018 European Association of Urology.

In this study we followed the fate of -exposing platelets in the presence of antibodies purified from Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and primary Anti-phospholipid Syndrome (APS) patients' sera by beta2GPI affinity chromatography. Thrombin-activated platelets exposed  and associated to beta2GPI. Both events were required for recognition by antibodies. Human monocyte-derived macrophages phagocytosed activated platelets only. Each macrophage internalized an average of 3.16+/-.2 platelets after 60 min at 37 degrees C. Phagocytosis did not increase after longer incubations (4.65+/-.26 platelets internalized by each macrophage after 300 min). Recognition of platelets by anti-beta2GPI antibodies significantly increased phagocytosis (P< .01). Upon withdrawal of thrombin, platelets downregulated  ( exposure t(1/2): 242 min) and the ability to be recognized by macrophages. Purified beta2GPI bound to -exposing platelets (association t(1/2): 250 min). Phosphatidyl serine exposure and beta2GPI association had virtually identical kinetics. Antibody binding prolonged the exposure of the beta2GPI/ complex (t(1/2): >1200 min). The ability to phagocytose opsonized platelets was accordingly sustained (5.3+/-.2 opsonized platelets were internalized by each macrophage after 60 min and 9.4+/-.3 after 300 min). Anti-beta2GPI antibodies therefore poise activated platelets in a -exposing status, preventing the recycling of their function and favoring their phagocytic clearance.Copyright 2000 Academic Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20941812>Concurrent chemoimmunotherapy: is it still the best option for the treatment of metastatic melanoma in patients with good performance status?</a></h2><p>To determine the efficacy, toxicity and survival of metastatic melanoma patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology group good performance status (ECOG  -1) receiving concurrent chemotherapy and .From March 2003 to August 2008, 25 patients with metastatic melanoma were enrolled in the study. No patient had previously received chemotherapy or . Patients with ECOG  -1 were treated with cisplatin+vinblastine+DTIC (CVD) and interferon-A2a (IFN-a).Response rate was 11/25 (44%): complete response (CR) 2, partial response (PR) 9, stable disease (SD) 11, progressive disease (PD) 3. Adverse effects were mild. The most common toxicities were nausea, vomiting and fever. Grade 3 and 4 toxicity was more common in hematologic parameters. No treatment-related deaths occurred. The median overall survival (OS) was 14 months and time to progression 8. months.Concomitant chemoimmunotherapy appeared to be a beneficial option for metastatic melanoma patients with good .

Using a prototype software program (Advanced Perfusion and Permeability Application, Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands), blood volume (BV), blood flow (BF), and permeability surface area product () were calculated for each tumor at baseline, week 5, and week 10. These parameters as well as relative changes between baseline and weeks 5 and 10 were tested for associations with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests.Using the 25th percentile as the cutoff, baseline BV for all patients independent of subsequent treatment was statistically significantly associated with PFS (10.8 vs 5.3 months, P = .007) and OS (35.2 vs 13.3 months, P = .001), and baseline BF was significantly associated with OS (31.7 vs 14.6 months, P = .024) with high values for both parameters being associated with significantly longer PFS and OS. Baseline  was not associated with PFS or OS.In patients treated with angiogenesis inhibitors (bevacizumab, sunitinib, pazopanib, or temsirolimus), the relative change in BV from baseline to week 5 using 25th percentile as the cutoff was associated with PFS (5.6 vs 24.8 months, P = .001) and OS (19.1 months vs not reached, P = .008) and from baseline to week 10 with PFS (8.1 vs 16.4 months, P = .014) and OS (.5 months vs not reached, P = .002). The relative change in BF from baseline to week 5 using medians as the cutoff was associated with PFS (5.5 vs 14.3 months, P = .018) and OS (14.6 vs 31.7 months, P = .027). The relative change in BF from baseline to week 10 using 25th percentile as the cutoff was associated with PFS (8.3 vs 46.9 months, P = .011) and OS (19.1 vs 53. months, P = .006). For both parameters, the largest reductions during early treatment were associated with increased PFS and OS.In patients receiving  only (interferon alpha and interleukin 2), relative changes in  between baseline and weeks 5 and 10 were significantly associated with PFS with larger increases associated with longer PFS. In patients receiving angiogenesis inhibitors, the relative changes in  between baseline and week 10 were significantly associated with PFS and OS with larger reductions associated with favorable outcomes.In patients with mRCC treated with angiogenesis inhibitors, the largest reductions in BV and BF between baseline and weeks 5 and 10 were associated with favorable outcomes. At baseline, the lowest BV and BF were associated with the poorest outcomes regardless of the subsequent treatment. Early reductions in  were associated with favorable outcomes for those treated with angiogenesis inhibitors and with poor outcomes for those treated with immunotherapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21720704>Chemotherapy with or without low-dose interleukin-2 in advanced non-small cell lung cancer: results from a phase III randomized multicentric trial.</a></h2><p>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is associated with IL-2-dependent cell-mediated immunodeficiency. As IL-2 is the main lymphocyte growth factor, a phase III randomized multicenter trial was conducted to evaluate the impact of subcutaneous low-dose IL-2 added to standard chemotherapy (CT) on overall survival (OS) in advanced NSCLC patients. Patients (n=241) with histologically confirmed stage IIIb or IV non-operable NSCLC underwent stratified randomization on the basis of center, ECOG , stage of disease and percentage of weight loss. Patients received gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) on days 1 and 8 + cisplatin (100 mg/m2) on day 2 every 21 days for a maximum of 6 cycles [chemotherapy (CT) arm]. In the CT+IL-2 arm, patients also received low-dose subcutaneous IL-2 3,000,000 IU/die on days 3-5, 9-11, -17. The study had 90% power to detect a 20% absolute increase in 1-year OS with 118 patients/arm. An overall response (OR) rate of 12.8% (14% in the CT+IL-2 arm and 11.4% in CT arm) was observed. Stable disease was 70 and 66.7%, and progressive disease 16 and 21.8% in the CT+IL-2 and CT arms, respectively. No differences in response were found in any subgroup analysis. At a median follow-up of 32 months, 1-year OS was 45% for the CT+IL-2 arm vs. 51% for the CT arm (p=.456 log-rank). Median progression-free survival was 6.6 months in the CT+IL-2 arm vs. 6.9 months in the CT arm (p=.573, log-rank). A higher number of grade 4 toxicities were reported with CT+IL-2. The most common grade ≥3 adverse events were gastrointestinal toxicity (mainly nausea and diarrhea) and myelosuppression. No relevant differences in clinical outcome were observed from the addition of IL-2 to CT.

After the induction treatment disease-free patients underwent to at least one year of BCG maintenance therapy. Endpoints were: initial response to BCG, cancer-free survival and rate of progression at 2 years, rate of complications.No statistically significant differences were found in terms of initial response to BCG (69% in Group 1 vs 71% in Group 2, P = .75), cancer free survival (57% vs 55% respectively, P = .77) and rate of progression (20% vs 14% respectively, P = .26) at 2 years. The difference in the rate of overall complications was statistically significant (% in Group 1 vs 27% in Group 2, P = .03), in the rate of severe complications was not statistically significant (5% in Group 1 vs 7% in Group 2, P = .61).A tailored regimen of BCG administration is possible and safe in frail elderly patients, limiting side effects and risk of undertreatment but maintaining oncological outcomes. Preliminary results in a small patients group are promising but larger randomized studies are needed to confirm our data.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, PNU-214565, a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the Fab of the monoclonal antibody C242 and staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA), was used in an escalating repeat dose Phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced gastrointestinal malignancies. A prior single-dose Phase I clinical trial had demonstrated safety at doses of 1.5 ng/kg with toxicities of fever and hypotension that were not dose related. Twenty-seven patients (age range, 36-75 years; median, 62; 14 males and 13 females; 23 colorectal and 4 pancreatic) were treated in the present study with one cycle of four consecutive daily 3-h infusions of PNU-214565 at doses of . ng/kg (n = 3); .5 ng/kg (n = 3), 1.5 ng/kg (n = 4), 2.75 ng/kg (n = 12), and 3.5 ng/kg (n = 5). All patients had a good performance status [Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group:  =  (n = ),  = 1 (n = 12)]. As in the single-dose trial, fever and hypotension were the most common toxicities. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), consisting of transient hypotension responsive to dopamine, was experienced by one patient treated at the 2.75 ng/kg dose level. One patient with pancreatic cancer metastatic to the liver experienced a partial response of hepatic metastases with stable pancreatic head abnormalities by computed tomography scan. Further dose escalation was suspended when two patients treated in a companion repeat dose Phase I study experienced DLT at the 4 ng/kg dose level. Multiparameter analyses on all patients treated in the two companion single-dose and two-repeated-dose Phase I trials revealed that the levels of patients' pretreatment anti-SEA antibodies protected against toxicity at a given drug dose. By jointly considering weight and the baseline anti-SEA concentration in a patient, it is possible to assign a PNU-214565 dose that will induce systemic cytokine release (a surrogate test to assess for the presence of uncomplexed drug and its ability to induce systemic cellular activation) without DLT. This pharmacodynamically based dosing scheme will be tested in future repeated-dose clinical trials and will define maximally tolerated doses of this powerful new  approach.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30268448>Rare targetable drivers (RTDs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): Outcomes with immune check-point inhibitors (ICPi).</a></h2><p>Efficacy of immune check-point inhibitors (ICPi) in NSCLC with rare targetable drivers (RTDs) is largely unknown.Consecutive patients with NSCLC and RTDs (non-EGFR/ALK, n-82) were selected from the Davidoff Cancer Center database. ORR, PFS, OS with ICPi, OS since advanced disease diagnosis, TMB, MSI, and PD-L1 expression were analyzed; uni- and multivariate PFS and OS analyses were done. OS with ICPi was compared between the RTD cohort and the non-selected NSCLC cohort (n-278).Of 50 tumors tested, 32%, 38%, and 30% were associated with ≥50%, 1-49% and <1% PD-L1 expression, respectively. Median TMB (n-48) comprised 4 muts/Mb (-57); TMB ≥ 10 muts/Mb was seen in 19% of tumors. Both TMB and PD-L1 expression varied across different RTDs. All the 47 tumors were MSI stable. ORR with ICPi (n-44) was 16%, median PFS was 3.2 months (95% CI, 2.6-5.), median OS was 16.2 months (95% CI, 8.4-NR). No correlation was seen between OS with ICPi and PD-L1 expression (p > .4), TMB (p > .8), or RTD type (p > .3). In the multivariate analysis, ECOG  (p-.005), targeted agents exposure (p-.005), and ICPi exposure (p-.04) were the only variables which correlated with OS since advanced disease diagnosis. Median OS since advanced disease diagnosis comprised 32 months (95% CI, 19.9-44.9) and 13 months (95% CI, 6.6-.9) for patients who were and were not exposed to ICPi, respectively (log-rank test-6.3; p-.01). In the inter-cohort comparison, for patients matched for ECOG  (/1), median OS with ICPi comprised 17.5 months (95% CI, 8.1-NR) and 8.6 months (95% CI, 6.7-NR) for RTD and non-selected patients, respectively (log-rank test-2.4, p-.1).In NSCLC with RTD, ICPi have favorable efficacy and independent impact on OS.

Histology included 16 papillary, 14 unclassified, 5 chromophobe, 4 collecting duct, 1 Xp11 translocation and 1 MTSCC (mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma). Among 35 patients who were evaluable for best response, 7 (20%) had PR and 10 (29%) had SD. Responses were observed in unclassified, papillary and collecting duct subtypes. In the entire cohort, median follow-up was 8.5 months and median treatment duration was 3. months. Median PFS was 3.5 months and median OS was not reached. Among responders, median time to best response was 5.1 months, and median duration of response was not reached as only 2 out of 7 responders had disease progression during follow-up. TRAEs of any grade were noted in 37% and most commonly included fatigue (12%), fever (10%) and rash (10%). Nivolumab treatments were postponed in 34% and discontinued in % of patients due to intolerance. No treatment-related deaths were observed.Nivolumab monotherapy demonstrated objective responses and was well tolerated in a heterogeneous population of patients with non-clear cell mRCC. In the absence of other data in this treatment setting, this study lends support to the use of nivolumab for patients with metastatic non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31341623>Efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab in Japanese patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma: A retrospective multicenter analysis.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-PD1 therapy (nivolumab) in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in a clinical setting. Between March 2013 and January 2018, 33 patients with RCC (27 men and 6 women) were treated with nivolumab. Before anti-PD1 treatment, 12, 9 and 12 patients received one, two, and three or more therapies, respectively. Objective response, survival rate, and clinical adverse events were evaluated by the revised RECIST criteria (version 1.1). The median patient age was 68 years (range: 37-79). In total, 14 (42%) patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG ) of  while 17 (52%) and two (6%) had an ECOG  of 1 and 2 or higher, respectively. One (3%), 24 (73%) and eight (24%) were classified as having favorable, intermediate, and poor risk, respectively. The median follow-up duration after nivolumab initiation was 26 months (range: 1-131). The median progression-free and overall survival were 10.3 months and 45.9 months, respectively. Nivolumab was associated with a disease control rate of 58%, with an objective response of 24% (complete response, 1; partial response, 7; stable disease, 11; progressive disease, 10; not assessed, 4). A total of  (46%) patients experienced adverse events, of which six were severe (grade 3 or more) and 10 were -related. This study examined the initial experience of nivolumab administration in Japanese patients with advanced RCC. Our results suggest that nivolumab can achieve acceptable outcomes in a real clinical setting, with outcomes that are comparable to those of clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11165411>Palliative and therapeutic activity of IL-2  in unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma with pleural effusion: Results of a phase II study on 31 consecutive patients.</a></h2><p>Malignant pleural mesothelioma is often unresectable at diagnosis, is refractory to cytotoxic agents and is frequently complicated by pleural effusion. The expected survival range for patients with or without involvement of visceral pleura is respectively 1-9 and 9-12 months; mesothelioma-related pleural effusion severely impairs the patients' quality of life and easily relapses after conservative treatments. Intrapleural administration of IL-2 is reported to be effective both in tumor-associated malignant pleurisy and on primary mesothelioma, whereas few data exist about IL-2 systemic administration. In order to assess the palliative and therapeutic activity of IL-2 in unresectable pleural malignant mesothelioma with pleural effusion, we performed a phase II study on 31 consecutive patients (M/F 16/; median age 61 years, range 40-84;  ECOG  n=7; ECOG 1 n=; ECOG 2 n=9; stage IA n=13; IB n=9; II n=7; IV=2) who received first-line therapy with intrapleural repeated instillation of 9000000 I.U. IL-2 twice/weekly for 4 weeks, after needle thoracenthesis. In nonprogressing patients, 3000000 I.U. IL-2 were subcutaneously administered thrice weekly for up to 6 months. Toxicity (WHO criteria) with intrapleural IL-2 consisted of grade 3 fever in 6/31 (19%) patients and of cardiac toxicity (failure) grade 3 in one patient (3%); toxicity during subcutaneous treatment was mild to moderate, mainly a flu-like syndrome. In 28/31 (90%) of patients there was no further or minimal (asymptomatic) pleural fluid collection (according to Paladine criteria); pleurisy relapsed only in 1/28 patients after 19 months. Tumor objective response (WHO criteria), evaluated by CT, occurred in seven patients (one CR and six PR; ORR 22%); ten patients achieved SD and 14 patients progressed. Median overall survival was  months (range 5-39) in all patients. IL-2 intrapleural administration followed by low-dose IL-2 subcutaneously in pleurisy-complicated malignant mesothelioma is feasible and active both in palliation of pleural effusion and on primary tumor, with manageable toxicity. The overall survival observed in nonprogressing patients warrants further randomized studies with IL-2 aimed to the patient outcome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12973028>Lymphocyte counts independently predict overall survival in advanced cancer patients: a biomarker for IL-2 .</a></h2><p>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) targets cells bearing IL-2 receptors and induces different degrees of lymphocytosis. This study retrospectively evaluated whether lymphocytosis, in addition to clinical characteristics at baseline and to tumor objective response, may predict overall survival in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients who received IL-2 subcutaneously (s.c.). Overall survival, clinical characteristics, tumor response, and total lymphocyte count at baseline and during the first treatment cycle of 266 advanced renal cell cancer patients, treated with 1 of 4 different first-line s.c. IL-2-based protocols, were studied using the Cox multivariate analysis. Median IL-2 cumulative dose and length of treatment (+/-SD) were 232 +/- 282 x 10(6)/m(2) in 7 +/- 5.9 weeks, respectively. Median overall survival (os) was 13.1 months (range .7-86.9+) in all. Tumor outcome consisted of: 9 CR (3%) (os = NR); 35 PR (13%) (os = 19.7 months.); 117 SD (44%) (os = .1 months); 105 PD (39%) (os = 6.4 months). Median lymphocyte counts were 1400/mm(3) at baseline (25th-75th, 900-1900/mm(3)) and 3600/mm(3) as a maximum value (25th-75th, 2600-4800/mm(3)). Death risk significantly decreased by 11% for each 1,000 lymphocytes/mm(3) (RR .89; 95% CI .82-.97), after correcting for clinical characteristics ( ECOG  versus > or =1, time from primary diagnosis > or =2 years versus <2 years, number of metastatic sites 1 versus >1) and tumor response (CR, PR). A two-step bootstrapping procedure confirmed such predictive performance. Lymphocyte count monitoring represents a biomarker of the host response to subcutaneous IL-2 treatment useful for multimodal clinical assessment, as it predicts overall survival in advanced cancer patients independently from tumor response and from main clinical characteristics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002953>Real-World Treatment of Stage III NSCLC: The Role of Trimodality Treatment in the Era of .</a></h2><p>Curative intent treatment of stage III NSCLC is variable and influenced by both patient and disease characteristics. We performed a real-world analysis of curative therapies in stage III NSCLC, and explored the impact of known prognostic factors on outcome.A retrospective review was completed of all patients with stage III NSCLC between January 2005 and December 2012. Cases were filtered to identify those receiving curative intent therapy including surgery, radiotherapy (RT), chemoradiotherapy (CRT), and combined modality with surgery (S + RT). Information was collected on known prognostic and predictive factors, and  eligibility per the PACIFIC trial. The primary outcome measure was overall survival.A total of 638 patients with stage III NSCLC were referred and received curative intent treatment. Of these, 66 (10%) received surgery, 95 (%) RT, 410 (64%) CRT, and 67 (11%) combined S + RT. Median overall survival (OS) was similar for surgery (28.6 mo) and CRT (27. mo), inferior for RT alone (17.5 mo), and superior for S + RT (55.8 mo). In a multivariate model only, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG ) and treatment cohort significantly influenced OS. In a case-matched analysis, the median OS for CRT was 31.9 months, compared to 55.8 months with trimodality treatment. Overall, 61% of patients receiving CRT and 88% of those receiving trimodality therapy would have been potentially eligible for adjuvant .In stage III NSCLC, the performance of surgery and CRT are similar after controlling for known prognostic factors. Radiotherapy alone is associated with worse outcomes. Combined S + RT appears to provide a significant benefit above other modalities, albeit in highly selected patients.Copyright © 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

Toxicity data included immune-related adverse events (irAEs), need for glucocorticoids, and hospitalization. The associations of toxicity with age, CCI, and ECOG  were evaluated using the exact χ test or Fisher exact test.We included 75 patients (median age: 74 y; range, 70-92 y); 53% had a CCI of 3 or higher; 49% had ECOG  of 2 or higher. Median OS for the whole cohort was 8.2 months (ECOG  -1 vs ≥2: 13.7 vs 3.8 mo; p < .01). Median TTF was 4.2 months (ECOG  -1 vs ≥2: 5.6 vs 2. mo; p = .02). Overall, 37% of patients experienced irAE of any grade (a total of 37 events); 8% were grade 3 or higher (no ICI-related deaths). Of those who discontinued ICIs (N = 64), % were due to irAEs. Of those who experienced irAEs, 64% required glucocorticoids. Hospitalizations during ICI treatment occurred in 72%. Toxicity generally did not differ by age, CCI, or ECOG .Outcomes in our cohort were driven by ECOG  rather than chronological age or comorbidities. The relatively high rates of ICI discontinuation, use of glucocorticoids, and hospitalization during ICI treatment in our study highlight the vulnerability of older adults with advanced NSCLC even in the  era.

Four of 12 warehouse peptides selected based on preexisting peptide-specific immunoglobulin G levels or the corresponding placebos were injected 1×/week for 12 weeks.Our trial met neither the primary (overall survival [OS]) nor secondary endpoints. Unfavorable factors for OS of 58 PPV patients compared with 30 placebo patients were SART2-93 peptide selection (n = 13 vs 8, hazard ratio [HR]: .9), ≥70 years old (4 vs 4, 7.87), >70 kg body weight (10 vs 7, 4.11), and performance status ()3 (8 vs 2, 2.82), respectively. Consequently, the median OS for PPV patients without SART2-93 selection plus one of these 3 favorable factors (<70 y old, ≤70 kg, or PS0-2) was significantly longer than that for the corresponding placebo patients (HR: .49, .44, and .51), respectively. Preexisting immunity against both all 12 warehouse peptides besides SART2-93 and the other cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope peptides was significantly depressed in the patients with SART2-93 selection (n = 21) compared with that of the patients without SART2-93 selection (n = 67). Biomarkers correlative for favorable OS of the PPV patients were a lower percentage of CD11b+CD14+HLA-DRlow immunosuppressive monocytes and a higher percentage of CD4+CD45RA- activated T cells, the intermediate levels of chemokine C-C ligand 2 (CCL2), vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, or haptoglobin, respectively.This phase III trial met neither the primary nor secondary endpoints.© The Author(s) 2018.
