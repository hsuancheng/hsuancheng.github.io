However, discontinuation of contraceptive methods and decline in the use of long-acting and permanent methods (LAPMs) are still the major concerns of the family planning programmes. This paper describes various factors that lead to the acceptance of the long-term method--Norplant and those that lead to early discontinuation. This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted in the Family Planning Association of Bangladesh (FPAB), Dinajpur, during March-June 2005 among 73 women who visited the clinic to remove their Norplant before its usual duration (5 years). The women were in the 25-31 years age-group--around two-thirds of them (57.5%) without formal education, and three-fourths of them (75.3%) were housewives. Most of them had been married for nine years, on average, and had two and/or more children. Sixty-seven percent of the women experienced regular menstruation, and 95% had used other contraceptive methods prior to using Norplant. Past users of Norplant were the single-most important source of information for about three-fourths of the women (74%); half of the women (51%) had discussed the method with their husbands, and majority (96%) of the husbands were informed about the women's decision on accepting the method before its implantation. All women were aware about the usual length of the effectiveness of Norplant. The most common reason for early removal of Norplant was menstrual disorder (59%), followed by desire for children (16%), husband's death, for abandonment or residing abroad (8%), anorexia, nausea, vomiting (7%),  gain (4%), husband's objection (3%), and religious beliefs (3%). Service providers should properly counsel the couple before providing any contraceptive method, informing them about method-related side-effects and clearing any religious misconceptions. They should also explore the perception of women as well as their partners' desire for children; couples who would like to have a baby within a year or two can be encouraged to use a short-term method that can be more easily discontinued.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16904415>Comparison profiles of cycle control, side effects and sexual satisfaction of three hormonal contraceptives.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to compare cycle control, tolerability and sexual well-being with the use of three hormonal contraceptives.In this prospective randomized study, the effects of two combined oral contraceptives [20 microg of ethinylestradiol (EE)/100 microg of  and 15 microg of EE/60 microg of gestodene] were compared with those of the vaginal ring (15 microg of EE/120 microg of etonogestrel). One-year data from 280 women were obtained. We investigated the pattern of menstrual cycle and the incidence of  gain, nausea, headache, breast tenderness, irritability, depression and vaginal dryness. Moreover, desire and sexual satisfaction were evaluated. Finally, the cumulative rate of discontinuation in the three groups was estimated.The analysis of adverse events revealed two crucial points for acceptability, compliance and continuation: poor cycle control and disturbance of sexual intercourse due to vaginal dryness and loss of desire.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29367841>Effect of synthetic hormones on reproduction in .</a></h2><p>Rodent pest management traditionally relies on some form of lethal control.

Consumption of the bait and animal  mass was mostly the same between treatments when analysed by sex, day and treatment. However, a repeated  ANOVA indicated that quinestrol and quinestrol +  treatments reduced consumption by up to 45%, particularly at the higher concentrations of 50 and 100 ppm. Although there was no clear concentration effect on animal  mass, quinestrol and quinestrol +  lowered  mass by up to 20% compared to the untreated and  treatments. Quinestrol and quinestrol +  reduced the  of male rat testes, epididymis and seminal vesicles by 60-80%, and sperm concentration and motility were reduced by more than 95%. No  changes were observed to uterine and ovarian tissue; however, high uterine oedema was observed among all female rats consuming treated bait at 8 and 40 days from trial start. Trials with mate pairing showed there were significant differences in the pregnancy rate with all treatments when compared to the untreated control group of rodents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30898659>Impact of the contraceptive implant on maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality in rural Papua New Guinea: a retrospective observational cohort study.</a></h2><p>Using routinely collected birth data, this study sought to measure changes in maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality after introduction of the  contraceptive implant into a large, rural island population in Papua New Guinea (PNG).We conducted a retrospective observational study of birth records from 4251 births that occurred between January 2010 and December 2016 on Karkar Island, PNG. The primary outcome was the change in crude birth rate (CBR) before (2010-2012) and after (2014-2016) introduction of the implant. Secondary outcomes were the change in rates (per year/1000 births) of severe postpartum hemorrhage, postpartum infection, hospital readmission, prematurity (<37 weeks), low birth  (<2500 g) and maternal and neonatal mortality. We also studied changes in the number of pregnancies affected by grand multiparity (≥4) and short interpregnancy interval (<12 months) for the same time periods. Data were analyzed using interrupted time series and Poisson regression.CBR was stable until 2012 and then declined from 2014 (p<.0001). Following introduction of the implant, the annual rate/1000 births of selected adverse birth outcomes decreased between 56% and 74% (p<.0001). The number of women with parity ≥4 who gave birth decreased by 59% (p<.0001), and the number with interpregnancy interval <12 months decreased by 64% (p<.0001).Introduction of the contraceptive implant was associated with reductions in CBR, maternal and neonatal morbidity, and the number of women with high-risk pregnancies giving birth.These results encourage efforts to increase knowledge and availability of the contraceptive implant in low- and middle-income countries such as PNG. In cases where it reduces the CBR and the number of women with high-risk pregnancies birthing, the implant may have a beneficial impact on maternal and neonatal morbidity.Copyright © 2019.

We examined the effects of patient obesity on primary breast tumor gene expression, by profiling transcription of a set of 103 tumors for which the patients'  mass index (BMI) was ascertained. Sample profiles were stratified according to patients' obesity phenotype defined as normal (BMI < 25), overweight (BMI 25-29.9), or obese (BMI ≥ 30). Widespread gene expression alterations were evident in breast tumors from obese patients as compared to other tumors, allowing us to define an obesity-associated cancer transcriptional signature of 662 genes. In multiple public expression data sets of breast cancers (representing > 1,500 patients), manifestation of the obesity signature patterns correlated with manifestation of a gene signature for IGF signaling and (to a lesser extent) with lower levels of estrogen receptor. In one patient cohort, manifestation of the obesity signature correlated with shorter time to metastases. A number of small molecules either induced or suppressed the obesity-associated transcriptional program in vitro; estrogens alpha-estradiol, , and hexestrol induced the program, while several anti-parkinsonian agents targeting neurotransmitter receptor pathways repressed the program. Obesity in breast cancer patients appears to impact the gene expression patterns of the tumor (perhaps as a result of altered  chemistry). These results warrant further investigation of obesity-associated modifiers of breast cancer risk and disease outcome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21656494>[Health risks of oral contraceptives].</a></h2><p>Oral contraceptives (OC) are either composed of a combination of an estrogen derivative (usually ethinly estradiol) and a progestogen, or they contain a progestogen only. OC are characterized by a high effectiveness and have a low failure rate if taken correctly. Most women tolerate OC relatively well, but adverse effects do occur which are driven by the estrogen dose as well as by the type of progestogen. The most frequently reported adverse effects are nausea or vomiting, breast tenderness, headache or inbalanced mood, but these unwanted side effects are often transient. The fear of  gain of many OC users is not necessarily supported by data from studies which report relatively little differences in  mass index on average during OC use. Nevertheless, substantial  gain can occur in individual women. The widely discussed fear of breast cancer is also not justified, and the risk of developing ovarian or endometrial cancer is reduced for women who use OC on a regular basis. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the adverse effect with the greatest potential for serious harm if pulmonary embolism develops. This rare, but potentially dangerous adverse effect of OC has been discussed emotionally for many years and keeps attracting a lot of public interest. VTE is rare in young women, but the VTE risk is increased two- to sixfold for OC users as compared to non-users. The VTE risk increases with increasing estrogen dose, is highest in the first year of use, and is higher for OC from the third generation (containing desogestrel, gestodene or norgestimate) than for OC from the second generation (containing ) or than for the progestogen-only pill. According to most studies, OC containing the progestogens drospirenone or cyproterone acetate are similar with regard to VTE risks than OC from the third generation. Individual genetic susceptibility affecting the clotting system plays a major role in the risk of developing VTE in combination with OC, and smoking is also an important contributing factor to an increased VTE risk for women using OC. It is important that doctors and pharmacists inform new users of OC about potential health risks of OC use, and that the personal and family history of previous health risks is assessed thoroughly in order to rule out that important and relevant contraindications are present when a women starts taking OC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15926681>In vitro release of  from phase sensitive and thermosensitive smart polymer delivery systems.</a></h2><p>The objective of this research is to develop injectable controlled delivery systems for the contraceptive hormone,  (LNG), using phase sensitive and thermosensitive polymers. A combination of poly (lactide) (PLA) and a solvent mixture of benzyl benzoate (BB) and benzyl alcohol (BA) was used in the phase-sensitive polymer delivery systems. The effects of solvent systems and polymer concentrations on the in vitro LNG release were evaluated. In the case of thermosensitive polymer delivery systems, a series of low-molecular- poly (lactide-co-glycolide)-poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA-PEG-PLGA) triblock copolymers with varying ratios of lactide/glycolide (LA/GA, 2.0-3.5) were used. The effects of varying block length of copolymers 1, 2, 3, and 4 on the in vitro LNG release were evaluated. Phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% w/v Tween-80 was used as in vitro release medium. The amount of the released LNG was determined by an high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. A controlled (zero-order) in vitro release of LNG was observed from both phase-sensitive and thermosensitive-polymer delivery systems. Increasing the concentration of the phase-sensitive polymer from 5% to 30% significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the release rate of LNG from 38.32 microg/day to 31.45 microg/day; and increasing the hydrophilic fraction of the solvents mixture (i.e., BA) significantly (p < 0.05) increased the release rate of LNG. In the case of the thermosensitive polymer delivery system, increasing the hydrophobic PLGA block length of copolymers significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the release rate of LNG (98.65 microg/day to 67.60 microg/day). It is evident from this study that both the phase sensitive and thermosensitive polymers are suitable for developing prolonged-release injectable delivery systems for the contraceptive hormone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28641030>Estetrol combined with drospirenone: an oral contraceptive with high acceptability, user satisfaction, well-being and favourable  control.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated acceptability, user satisfaction,  control and general well-being of estetrol (E4) combined with either drospirenone (DRSP) or  (LNG).In this open-label, multi-centre, dose-finding, 6-cycle study, 396 healthy women of reproductive age were randomised into five treatment groups in a 24/4-day regimen: 15 mg or 20 mg E4 combined with either 3 mg DRSP or 150 μg LNG, and as reference estradiol valerate (E2V) combined with dienogest (DNG). Data on acceptability, user well-being, satisfaction and  were collected.The number of completers was the highest in the 15 mg E4/DRSP group (91.1%), and the lowest for 20 mg E4/LNG (70.1%). The largest proportion of treatment satisfaction was reported for 15 mg E4/DRSP (73.1%), and the lowest for 15 mg E4/LNG (50.6%). The number of women willing to continue with the assigned study treatment was the highest in the 15 mg E4/DRSP group (82.1%) and the lowest for 20 mg E4/LNG (58.3%). Well-being with E4/DRSP combinations was statistically significantly better than with E4/LNG combinations: OR (95% CI) 2.00 (1.13; 3.53) and 1.93 (1.06; 3.56) for 15 and 20 mg E4, respectively, and comparable to E2V/DNG. Proportion of women with a 2 kg or more  loss after 3 and 6 cycles was the highest in the 15 mg E4/DRSP group (30.7 and 36.7%, respectively).The present study shows that 15 mg estetrol combined with 3 mg DRSP is associated with a high-user acceptability and satisfaction, and with a favourable  control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19185442>Validated UPLC method for the fast and sensitive determination of steroid residues in support of cleaning validation in formulation area.</a></h2><p>An ultra performance liquid chromatographic (UPLC) method was developed for simultaneous determination of seven steroid (dienogest, finasteride, gestodene, , estradiol, ethinylestradiol, and norethisterone acetate) active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) residues.

The doses for EP-1, E and P were 1, 0.34 and 0.66 mg/kg , respectively. Male voles (n = 98) were treated daily for 5 or 14 days, then the testes and epididymides were collected, weighed and examined histologically at 30 (D30), 60 (D60) or 90 (D90) days after the end of treatment. Four males were allowed to mate with normal females at D90. Female voles (n = 75) were treated for 3 days and a further 3 days after a 7-day interval.

Study procedures took place during clinical research unit admissions, where participants received a standardized meal and each study drug, in random order, during two separate 24-h admissions. Study staff collected 14 blood specimens (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24 and 48h). We evaluated serum concentrations of LNG and UPA using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy and estimated the PK parameters of both drugs using noncompartmental analysis. The main outcome of this study was a comparison of between-group differences in AUC.Thirty-two women completed the study (16 in each group). Among normal-BMI and obese-BMI participants, the mean BMIs were 22.0 (range 18.8-24.6) and 34.3 (range 30.6-39.9), respectively. After LNG-EC, mean AUC and maximum concentration (C) were 50% lower among obese-BMI women than among normal-BMI women (AUC 100.8 vs. 208.5ng*h/mL, IQR 35.8, IQR 74.2, p≤.01; C 10.8 vs. 18.2ng/mL, p=.01). After UPA-EC, AUC and C were similar between obese-BMI and normal-BMI women (AUC 362.5 vs. 293.5ng*h/mL, IQR 263.2, IQR 112.5, p=.15; C 95.6 vs. 89.3ng/mL, p=.70).After a single dose of EC, obese-BMI women are exposed to lower concentrations of LNG and similar concentrations of UPA, when compared to normal-BMI women.Differences in LNG-EC PK by BMI group may underlie and account for the lower LNG-EC efficacy reported among obese-BMI women, but modest differences in UPA-EC PK by BMI group provide less support for variable efficacy. A pharmacodynamic study may be able to clarify whether these PK differences account for observed differences in LNG-EC and UPA-EC efficacy.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Obese women, who are more at risk for venous thromboembolism and cardiovascular events due to their condition, might be at an even higher risk of developing thromboembolic events when on medical contraception. Combined hormonal contraceptives might be less effective in obese women and may lead to unacceptable metabolic side effects for this population. In addition, the lack of safety data for  loss drugs and the higher risk for complications during and after pregnancy require a close surveillance of the fertility status of obese patients.The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the available medical contraceptive options and to give the readers a practical guidance for a wise contraceptive choice with regards to obesity.A general literature review of peer-reviewed publications on the topic "obesity and contraception" was performed using the PubMed database.Nowadays, there are many useful tools that help clinicians in choosing among the wide range of therapeutic possibilities, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) Medical Eligibility Criteria for contraceptive use. Furthermore, the great diversity of hormonal contraceptive formulations (combined hormonal formulations; progestin-only methods) and active substances (different estrogens and progestins) allow physicians to tailor therapies to patients' clinical peculiarities.Long-acting reversible contraceptives [progestin-only implants, -intra-uterine devices (IUDs) and copper IUDs] and progestin-only methods in general are excellent options for many categories of patients, including obese ones.V, narrative review.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26181091>Short-Term Treatment of Bothersome Bleeding for Etonogestrel Implant Users Using a 14-Day Oral Contraceptive Pill Regimen: A Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>To understand whether using oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) results in temporary interruption of bleeding for etonogestrel contraceptive implant users during a 14-day course.In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned etonogestrel implant users reporting 7 consecutive days or more of bothersome bleeding to receive 14 pills of study drug (150 microgram  and 30 microgram ethinyl estradiol combined OCPs) or an identical-appearing placebo. The primary outcome was the proportion of women in each group who stopped bleeding during therapy and continued to report no bleeding at the end of therapy. Prespecified secondary outcomes were number of days until temporary interruption of bleeding occurred, number of days without bleeding during therapy, and number of days to recurrence of bleeding after discontinuation of therapy. We hypothesized that temporary interruption of bleeding would occur in 80% of the treatment group compared with 20% in the control group; using 80% power, we needed a sample size of 26 women. We performed intent-to-treat analysis.From November 2013 through December 2014, 66 women were screened and 32 were randomized: OCPs (n=16) or placebo (n=16). The majority was young, Caucasian women with reported bleeding as extremely or very annoying; groups had similar baseline characteristics. Participants randomized OCPs were more likely (14 of 16 [87.5%±16.2%] compared with six of 16 [37.5%±23.7%]) to have a temporary interruption of bleeding during the study drug period (odds ratio 11.7, 95% confidence interval 1.9-70.2). Of women in the OCP arm who had a temporary interruption, 85.7% had bleeding recurrence within 10 days after treatment.Bothersome bleeding in etonogestrel contraceptive implant users will usually stop with 14-day OCP treatment, but bleeding most often resumes within days of treatment cessation.ClinicalTrials.gov, www.clinicaltrials.gov, .I.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23582238> change at 12 months in users of three progestin-only contraceptive methods.</a></h2><p>Concerns about  gain may influence contraceptive use.

Women who had been using the ENG implant, LNG-IUS, DMPA or copper IUD continuously for at least 11 months were eligible for participation. We obtained  at enrollment and at 12 months and compared the  change for each progestin-only method to the copper IUD.We enrolled a total of 427 women: 130 ENG implant users, 130 LNG-IUS users, 67 DMPA users and 100 copper IUD users. The mean  change (in kilograms) over 12 months was 2.1 for ENG implant users [standard deviation (SD)=6.7]; 1.0 for LNG-IUS users (SD=5.3); 2.2 for DMPA users (SD=4.9) and 0.2 for copper IUD users (SD=5.1). The range of  change was broad across all contraceptive methods. In the unadjusted linear regression model, ENG implant and DMPA use were associated with  gain compared to the copper IUD. However, in the adjusted model, no difference in  gain with the ENG implant, LNG-IUS or DMPA was observed. Only Black race was associated with significant  gain (1.3 kg, 95% confidence interval=0.2-2.4) when compared to other racial groups. change was variable among women using progestin-only contraceptives.

Subjects were randomly allocated to receive either an OC (ethinyl estradiol [E2] 20 microg and  100 microg) or a matching placebo for 3 months. Participants used their usual pain medications as needed during the trial. The main outcome measure was score on the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (pain subscale) for the third menstrual cycle on treatment. Secondary outcomes included pain intensity (rated 0 to 10), days of any pain, days of severe pain, hours of pain on worst day, and use of pain medications.The mean Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire pain score was lower (less pain) in the OC group than the placebo group (3.1, standard deviation 3.2 compared with 5.8, standard deviation 4.5, P = .004, 95% confidence interval for the difference between means 0.88-4.53).

Additionally, more obese (6/10 vs. 3/10 normal BMI, p>.05) women exhibited E(2) levels consistent with development of a dominant follicle and P levels consistent with ovulation (2/10 vs. 1/10) during Cycle 2.Compared to women with normal BMI, obese women exhibit differences in OC pharmacokinetics that are associated with greater HPO activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16134591>[Compound nylestriol tablet to prevent bone loss in osteoporotic rats].</a></h2><p>To investigate the effects of compound nylestriol tablet (CNT), containing nylestriol and  with a ratio of 1:0.3) and its components on the osteoporotic rat model induced by retinoic acid (RA) and ovariectomy (OVX).We randomly divided 144 female SD rats (aged 7-month-old) into 12 groups (12 in each). In addition, 120 female SD rats aged 4-month were randomly divided into 10 groups (10 in each). Three dosage levels of CNT (0.039, 0.117 and 0.39 mg/kg , daily), nylestriol (NYL, 0.30, 0.09 and 0.03 mg/kg , daily) and  (LEV, 0.09, 0.027 and 0.009 mg/kg , daily) were designed to prevent the bone loss of the osteoporotic rat model induced by RA and OVX respectively. Serum total calcium (Ca), phosphate (Pi), ALP, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, total  BMD, isolated left femoral BMD and femoral Ca, and Pi after ashing were determined.Osteoporotic models could be induced by RA (70 mg/kg  weightdaily given intragastrically for 14 days) or by ovariectomy; CNT and its components had the preventive effects on bone loss in both models; The preventive effect of CNT was dose-dependent and stronger than its components; Many observed markers showed us the levels of high and moderate CNT given to be the strongest, corresponding to an optimal choice of the moderate dose CNT about one tablet per week in adult women.CNT therapy can prevent the bone loss of RA-induced and OVX-induced osteoporotic rats, and its therapeutic and preventive effect is better than its components used alone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23262424>Formulation and optimization of desogestrel transdermal contraceptive patch using crystallization studies.</a></h2><p> (LNG) is the most commonly used progestin in contraception. In this study, we report the use of an alternative progestin, desogestrel, for transdermal contraception. The drug was found to be significantly more permeable as compared to LNG (p<0.05). Crystallization studies were used to select the best adhesive among acrylate (Duro-Tak 87-4098 and Duro-Tak 87-202A) and polyisobutylene (PIB, Duro-Tak 87-608A) pressure sensitive adhesives by determining the drug's saturation solubility in them. The use of copovidone and mineral oil as formulation excipients was investigated to increase drug loading in the PIB adhesive. Physical characterization of the patches was performed using in vitro drug release, content analysis, patch  and thickness variations and rolling ball tack and peel adhesion studies. Optimized patches were evaluated for in vitro transdermal delivery across hairless rat skin. The saturation solubility of desogestrel was found to be approximately 49.3% (w/w) and 55.6% (w/w) in Duro-Tak 87-4098 and Duro-Tak 87-202A acrylate adhesives, respectively. The saturation solubility of desogestrel was significantly lower (3-4%, w/w) in the PIB adhesive. Mineral oil (10%, w/w) and copovidone (30%, w/w) were found to be optimum for increasing drug loading and patch cosmetics. Results from the physical characterization studies suggest that a uniform and reproducible 7 day drug-in-adhesive patch could be developed.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This study was designed to measure PK parameters with greater accuracy in obese users of a low-dose oral contraceptive (OC) and to correlate drug levels with assessments of end-organ activity.Obese [ mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2], ovulatory, otherwise healthy women (n=32) received an OC containing 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE)/100 mcg  (LNG) for two cycles. EE and LNG PK parameters were characterized for 168 h at the end of Cycle 1. During cycle 2, biweekly outpatient visits were performed to assess cervical mucus, monitor ovarian activity with transvaginal ultrasound and obtain serum samples to measure EE, LNG, estradiol and progesterone levels. PK parameters were calculated and correlated with end-organ activity and compared against control samples obtained from normal and obese women sampled up to 48 h in a previous study. Standard determination of PK accuracy was performed, defined by the dependency on extrapolated values ('excess' area under the curve of 25% or less).The mean BMI was 39.4 kg/m2 (SD 6.6) with a range of 30-64 kg/m2. Key LNG PK parameters were as follows: clearance, 0.52 L/h (SD 0.24); half-life, 65 h (SD 40); area under the curve (AUC), 232 h*ng/mL (SD 102); and time to reach steady state, 13.6 days (SD 8.4). The majority of subjects had increased ovarian activity with diameter of follicles ≥8 mm (n=25), but only seven women had follicles ≥10 mm plus cervical mucus scores ≥5. Evidence of poor end-organ suppression did not correlate with the severity of the alterations in PK. As compared to historical normal and obese controls (48-h PK sampling), clearance, half-life, AUC and time to reach steady state were found to be significantly different (p≤.05) in obese women undergoing a longer duration of PK sampling (168 h). Longer sampling also improved PK accuracy for obese women (excess AUC 20%) as compared to both normal and obese controls undergoing shorter sampling times (48 h) with excess AUCs of 25% and 50%, respectively.Obesity results in significant alterations in OC steroid PK parameters, but the severity of these alterations did not correlate with end-organ suppression. A longer PK sampling interval (168 h vs. 48 h) improved the accuracy of PK testing.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The present study compared the two kinds of OCPs (monophasic;  (LNG)-ethinyl estradiol (EE) 150/30 versus triphasic; LNG-EE 50-75-125/30-40-30) for adverse effects and patient satisfaction.A randomized clinical trial was performed on 314 women who used OCPs for the first time, as their contraception, for 6 months. Overall, 1884 cycles were studied. In the monophasic group (n=159 who finally finished the study), monophasic pills LNG-EE 150/30mcg, and in the triphasic group (n=155 who finally finished the study), triphasic pills LNG-EE 50-75-125/30-40-30 mcg were used. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 10: Chi square test, Fisher exact test and Student's t-test were used.There were no significant differences between the two groups for common side effects, including nausea, headache, nervousness, facial hyperpigmentation (chloasma), and  (increase or decrease) but breakthrough bleeding and spotting (BTB/S) were less in the triphasic group, occurring in 30 cycles (18.86%) versus 10 cycles (6.45%), P=0.009*. Patient satisfaction for the two OCPs was similar and high. The rates of side effects were low.It seems that the monophasic and triphasic pills are similar according to patient satisfaction and side effects; therefore there is no benefit of one over the other except for BTB/S, for which triphasic is superior.Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Estrogen-progestin therapy has been used as exogenous estrogen to normalize depressed estrogen level during menopause. Ovariectomized rodents mimic an estrogen-deficient state in that they develop cardiometabolic dysfunction, including insulin resistance (IR). We therefore hypothesized that hormonal therapy with combined oral contraceptive steroids, ethinylestradiol- (EEL), improves IR, obesity, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) through reduction of circulating mineralocorticoid in ovariectomized rats. Twelve-week-old female Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups: sham-operated (SHM) and ovariectomized (OVX) rats were treated with or without EEL (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol and 5.0 μg ) daily for 8 weeks. Results showed that OVX or SHM + EEL treated rats had increased HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment of IR), 1 h postload glucose, HOMA-β, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), TC/HDL cholesterol, TG/HDL cholesterol, plasma insulin, GSK-3, corticosterone, and aldosterone. On the other hand, OVX + EEL treatment ameliorated all these effects except that of aldosterone. Taken together, the results demonstrate that oral hormonal replacement with EEL improves IR and pancreatic β-cell function and suppresses GSK-3 and glucocorticoid independent of circulating aldosterone, suggesting a positive cardiometabolic effect of oral EEL therapy in estrogen-deficient rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308416>Oral contraceptive use increases risk of inflammatory and coagulatory disorders in women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome: An observational study.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a multispectral disorder requiring lifelong management. Its pathophysiology is still being explored which makes its treatment options restrained. Present study explores impact of oral contraceptive mode of treatment on metabolic, hormonal, inflammation and coagulation profile of PCOS women. 50 subjects diagnosed with Rotterdam criteria receiving no drug treatment served as controls whereas 50 subjects receiving only OCPs (Ethinyl estradiol 0.03 mg,  0.15 mg) as a mode of treatment at least for six-months served as cases. Ferriman-Gallwey score and hormonal profile improved on OCP treatment. However, parameters like ,  mass index, waist-hip ratio, Oral glucose tolerance test, lipid profile, insulin, HOMA-IR, adiponectin, interleukin1β, visfatin, resistin, tissue factor, PT and APTT showed considerable derangements in OCP group. All above parameters are associated with the risk of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, coronary vascular disease, cancers, hypercoagulable state, venous thromboembolism and thrombotic events. Long-term use of OCPs needs to be considered carefully for PCOS patients who are already burdened with associated risk factors.

POCs include injectables, intrauterine contraception, implants, and oral contraceptives. Many POCs are long-acting, cost-effective methods of preventing pregnancy. However, concern about  gain can deter the initiation of contraceptives and cause early discontinuation among users.The primary objective was to evaluate the association between progestin-only contraceptive use and changes in .Until 4 August 2016, we searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, POPLINE, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. For the initial review, we contacted investigators to identify other trials.We considered comparative studies that examined a POC versus another contraceptive method or no contraceptive. The primary outcome was mean change in  or mean change in  composition. We also considered the dichotomous outcome of loss or gain of a specified amount of .Two authors extracted the data. Non-randomized studies (NRS) need to control for confounding factors. We used adjusted  for the primary effects in NRS or the results of matched analysis from paired samples. If the report did not provide adjusted  for the primary analysis, we used unadjusted outcomes. For RCTs and NRS without adjusted , we computed the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous variables. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI.We found 22 eligible studies that included a total of 11,450 women. With 6 NRS added to this update, the review includes 17 NRS and 5 RCTs. By contraceptive method, the review has 16 studies of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), 4 of -releasing intrauterine contraception (LNG-IUC), 5 for implants, and 2 for progestin-only pills.Comparison groups did not differ significantly for  change or other  composition measure in 15 studies. Five studies with moderate or low quality evidence showed differences between study arms. Two studies of a six-rod implant also indicated some differences, but the evidence was low quality.Three studies showed differences for DMPA users compared with women not using a hormonal method. In a retrospective study,  gain (kg) was greater for DMPA versus copper (Cu) IUC in years one (MD 2.28, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.77), two (MD 2.71, 95% CI 2.12 to 3.30), and three (MD 3.17, 95% CI 2.51 to 3.83). A prospective study showed adolescents using DMPA had a greater increase in  fat (%) compared with a group not using a hormonal method (MD 11.00, 95% CI 2.64 to 19.36). The DMPA group also had a greater decrease in lean  mass (%) (MD -4.00, 95% CI -6.93 to -1.07). A more recent retrospective study reported greater mean increases with use of DMPA versus Cu IUC for  (kg) at years 1 (1.3 vs 0.2), 4 (3.5 vs 1.9), and 10 (6.6 vs 4.9).Two studies reported a greater mean increase in  fat mass (%) for POC users versus women not using a hormonal method. The method was LNG-IUC in two studies (reported means 2.5 versus -1.3; P = 0.029); (MD 1.60, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.75). One also studied a desogestrel-containing pill (MD 3.30, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.52). Both studies showed a greater decrease in lean  mass among POC users.We considered the overall quality of evidence to be low; more than half of the studies had low quality evidence. The main reasons for downgrading were lack of randomizations (NRS) and high loss to follow-up or early discontinuation.These 22 studies showed limited evidence of change in  or  composition with use of POCs. Mean  gain at 6 or 12 months was less than 2 kg (4.4 lb) for most studies. Those with multiyear data showed mean  change was approximately twice as much at two to four years than at one year, but generally the study groups did not differ significantly.

We examined provider and clinical setting characteristics and clinic patient demographics for association with provider misconceptions about safety of combined oral contraceptives (COCs), depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), or intrauterine devices (IUDs) for women with obesity. If providers considered methods as unsafe or do not know, we categorized those responses as misconceptions. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).A substantial proportion of respondents had misconceptions about the safety of COCs (31%), DMPA (24%), copper (Cu) (18%), and  (LNG)-IUDs (16%) for women with obesity. Provider type was associated with increased odds of misconceptions for all four methods compared with office-based obstetrician/gynecologists. Not having the method available onsite was associated with safety misconceptions of DMPA (aOR 1.90, 95% CI 1.07-3.36), Cu-IUD (aOR 4.19, 95% CI 1.51-11.61), and LNG-IUD (aOR 5.25, 95% CI 1.67-16.49).While the majority of providers considered all four contraceptive methods safe for women with obesity, substantial proportions had misconceptions about safety of COCs, DMPA, and IUDs.

The primary variables were the mean intraindividual relative changes from baseline to cycle 7 in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Changes in other lipid parameters, haemostatic parameters, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), cortisol-binding globulin (CBG), carbohydrate metabolism parameters, blood pressure and  were also assessed.Mean ± SD HDL cholesterol increased by 7.9% ± 21.8% with E(2)V/DNG and decreased by 2.3% ± 14.4% with EE/LNG. Mean ± SD LDL cholesterol decreased by 6.5% ± 15.9% with E(2)V/DNG and by 3.0% ± 17.4% with EE/LNG. Mean ± SD prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 and D-dimer levels remained essentially unchanged in the E(2)V/DNG group (-0.6% ± 30.3% and -2.1% ± 43.5%, respectively), but increased in the EE/LNG group (by 117.3% ± 358.0% and 62.9% ± 99.5%, respectively).

Estrogen substitution may reverse these metabolic consequences. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of oral contraceptives (OCs) on endothelial function measured as flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery, the lipid profile, and blood markers of endothelial activation (inflammation) in amenorrheic athletes. Age- and  mass index-matched groups of young endurance athletes with amenorrhea (n = 11), regularly cycling athletes (n = 13), and sedentary controls (n = 12) were examined before and after 9 months of treatment with a low dose, monophasic, combined OC (30 mug ethinyl estradiol and 150 mug ). The amenorrheic athletes displayed the lowest FMD at baseline and the largest increase after OC treatment. FMD also increased in the control group, but not in the regularly menstruating athletes, who had the highest values of FMD before treatment. All three groups, particularly the controls, showed moderate unfavorable changes in the lipid profile in accordance with previous known effects of a second generation OC. Furthermore, there was an overall increase in some inflammatory markers (high sensitive C-reactive protein and TNF-alpha) and a decrease in one of the markers (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1). We conclude that amenorrheic athletes benefit from treatment with OC with respect to endothelial function. OC treatment is also associated with some modest alterations in the lipid profile and in markers of inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26409014>A 3-year multicentre randomized controlled trial of etonogestrel- and -releasing contraceptive implants, with non-randomized matched copper-intrauterine device controls.</a></h2><p>Is there any difference in the clinical performance of the 3-year one-rod etonogestrel (ENG)- and the 5-year two-rod  (LNG)-releasing contraceptive implants during 3 years of insertion, and between implant and intrauterine device (IUD) contraception, in particular complaints possibly related to hormonal contraceptives?The cumulative contraceptive effectiveness after 3 years and method continuation through 2.5 years were not significantly different between ENG and LNG implants, but both outcomes were significantly worse in the non-randomized age-matched group of IUD users than in the combined implant group.ENG- and LNG-releasing implants are safe and highly efficacious contraceptives with pregnancy rates reported to be 0.0-0.5 per 100 women-years (W-Y). No head-to-head comparative study of the two implants has been undertaken, and little information is available on comparisons of complaints of side effects of implant and copper IUD users.This was an open parallel group RCT with 1:1 allocation ratio of the ENG and the LNG implants with non-randomized control group of women choosing TCu380A IUD to address lack of reliable data on common side effects typically attributed to the use of progestogen-only contraceptives. After device(s) placement, follow-ups were at 2 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and semi-annually thereafter for 3 years or until pregnancy, removal or expulsion of the implant/IUD occurred.The study took place in family planning clinics in Brazil, Chile, Dominican Republic, Hungary, Thailand, Turkey and Zimbabwe. Women seeking long-term contraception were enlisted after an eligibility check and informed consent, and 2982 women were enrolled: 1003, 1005 and 974 in the ENG-implant, LNG-implant and IUD groups, respectively; 995, 997 and 971, respectively, were included in the per protocol analysis reported here.ENG and LNG implants each had the same 3-year cumulative pregnancy rate of 0.4 per 100 W-Y [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1-1.4]. A  of ≥70 kg at admission was unrelated to pregnancy. Method continuation rates for ENG and LNG implants at 2.5 years were 69.8 (95% CI 66.8-72.6) and 71.8 per 100 W-Y (68.8-74.5), and at 3 years 12.1 (95% CI 5.2-22.0) and 52.0 per 100 W-Y (95% CI 41.8-61.2), respectively. Bleeding disturbances, the most frequent reason for method discontinuation, were significantly more common in the ENG group [16.7 (95% CI 14.4-19.3)] than in the LNG group [12.5 (95% CI 10.5-14.9)] (P 0.019). The 3-year cumulative loss to follow-up was lower in the ENG- than in the LNG-implant group, 8.1 (95% CI 6.4-10.2) and 14.4 per 100 W-Y (95% CI 12.1-17.1), respectively. The median duration of implant removal was 50 s shorter among women with ENG than among women with LNG implant (P < 0.0001). In the observational comparison between IUD and implant users, the 3-year relative risk for pregnancy in IUD group compared with the combined implant group was 5.7 per 100 W-Y (95% CI 4.4-7.3) (P = 0.0003). The 3-year expulsion rate of the IUD was 17.8 per 100 W-Y (95% CI 14.5-21.9), while the discontinuation rate for bleeding disturbances was 8.5 (95% CI 6.7-10.9). Frequency of complaints of headache and dizziness was not significantly different between implant and IUD users (P = 0.16 and 0.77, respectively), acne and bleeding irregularities were more frequent among implant users (P < 0.0001), while heavy bleeding and lower abdominal pain occurred more often among IUD than implant users (P < 0.0001).Few women were ≤19 years old or nulligravida, the proportion of implant users ≥70 kg was <20% and <8% were obese.Findings of the study can inform policy makers and clinicians about choice of implant, but also about TCu380A IUD in relation to implants.UNDP/UNFPA/WHO/UNICEF/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), Department of Reproductive Health and Research (RHR), World Health Organization (WHO).

The daily register of the acceptors were analysed for new acceptors of other methods during the same period and confirmed with their case notes. The acceptance incidence of Norplant was 3.2%. The mean age and parity of the acceptors were 32.2 +/- 4.5 years and 3.9 +/- 1.8 respectively. The duration of use ranged between 6 months and 13 years. 65% of the acceptors reported menstrual abnormalities. 48% of them reported reduced bleeding pattern, while 7.5% (25) discontinued method under 4 years of use because of increased bleeding episodes. Other side effects reported were headache 6%,  gain 3%, mastalgia 1.8%, decreased libido 1.8%, abdominal pain 1.5% and hypertension 1.2%. 20.4% (68) discontinued the use under 4 years because of desire to have another baby. 38.6% (129) had implants removed at 5 years, while 20.1% (67) continued the use for 6-13 years before removal and replacement with another set. Husband's request for removal constituted 7.2% (24). The effectiveness was 100% as no pregnancy was reported during the study period. The continuation rate at 5 years was 58.7%. 43 clients were however lost to follow up. Norplant was found to be an effective and acceptable method of long-term reversible contraception with minimal side effects. The low incidence was attributed to the fact that the implants were donor driven and not included in the country contraceptive logistic system. Norplant acceptors who continued the use after 5 years did so, because they enjoyed it and did not want to part with them without replacement of new sets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23623474>Effect of hormonal contraceptives during breastfeeding on infant's milk ingestion and growth.</a></h2><p>To measure infants' breast milk intake and infant growth when their mothers initiated either combined oral contraceptive (COC), -releasing intrauterine system, or etonogestrel-releasing implant, or copper intrauterine device (IUD) as a reference group.Prospective trial.University-based hospital.On postpartum day 42, 40 women initiated a contraceptive method according to their choice.Deuterium (D2O; 0.5 g/kg mother's ) was ingested by mothers on postpartum days 42, 52, and 63 as a marker of total  fluid.Infants' milk intake from 42 to 63 postpartum days was assessed by measurement of D2O levels in infants' saliva and infant growth by measuring their , height, and tibia length.

As novelties to the field, for the trimethylsilyl (TMS) oxime ether/ester derivatives of steroids and cholic acids, at first, a tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS), multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) type acquisition method has been developed in a single run; also for the first time, the three acquisition techniques, the full scan (FS), the selective ion monitoring (SIM), in our case the multiple ion monitoring (MIM) and the currently optimized MRM methods, have been compared; all three, in parallel, under strictly the same derivatization/instrumental conditions, both in matrix free solutions and municipal wastewater from two Hungarian wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Critical evaluation of the three acquisition protocols was collated on their analytical performances and validated under the same conditions. The data of six point calibration curves for FS, MIM and MRM methods, showed that both R² (0.9995, 0.9858, 0.9975) and RSD (5.3, 5.8, 5.0), for two parallel derivatizations, each injected three times, proved to be independent of the acquisition processes. Whereas, for the method limit of quantification (LOQ) and the instrument limit of quantification (ILQ) values showed considerable differences. LOQ data, were decreasing in the FS, MIM, MRM line (expressed in ng/L), for all steroids and cholic acids. The same trend was determined in terms of the ILQ values. The practical utility of the optimized acquisition techniques was confirmed by the quantitation of the steroids and cholic acids contents of wastewater samples. Results confirmed the importance of the MRM acquisition method, even in comparison to the MIM one: with particular interest in selected cases: avoiding the extreme overestimation of the β-estradiol (156-1325%) and that of the ethinylestradiol (582-831%) concentrations in the wastewater samples.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Descriptive methods (comparison of means and distributions according to pregnancy status and pregnancy rates across  and BMI categories) as well as cubic spline modeling were used to describe the relationship between pregnancy risk and /BMI.The analysis population comprised 1731 women, among whom 38 pregnancies were reported. Women for whom  was not effective in preventing pregnancy had a significantly higher mean  and BMI than women who did not become pregnant (76.7 vs. 66.4 kg, p<.0001; 28.1 vs. 24.6 kg/m², p<.0001). The estimated pregnancy rate increased significantly from 1.4% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.5%-3.0%] among the group of women weighing 65-75 kg to 6.4% (95% CI: 3.1%-11.5%) and 5.7% (95% CI: 2.9%-10.0%) in the 75-85 kg and >85 kg groups, respectively. Statistical modeling demonstrated a steep increase in pregnancy risk starting from a  near 70-75 kg to reach a risk of pregnancy of 6% or greater around 80 kg. Similar results were obtained for statistical modeling of BMI as well as when the two studies were analyzed individually.All analyses showed a significant drop in the efficacy of  emergency contraception with increasing , with pregnancy risk in the higher  categories similar to expected rates in the absence of contraception.

We defined 5P's - period, pill, prognosis, pregnancy, and postthrombotic syndrome - that should be discussed with young women with VTE. Menstrual blood loss (Period) can be aggravated by anticoagulant therapy. This seems particularly true for direct oral anticoagulants. Abnormal uterine bleeding can be managed by hormonal therapy, tranexamic acid, or modification of treatment. The use of combined oral contraceptives (Pill) is a risk factor for VTE. The magnitude of the risk depends on progestagen types and estrogen doses used. In women using therapeutic anticoagulation, concomitant hormonal therapy does not increase the risk of recurrent VTE. -releasing intrauterine devices and low-dose progestin-only pills do not increase the risk of VTE. In young women VTE is often provoked by transient hormonal risk factors that affects prognosis. Sex is incorporated as predictor in recurrent VTE risk assessment models. However, current guidelines do not propose using these to guide treatment duration. Pregnancy increases the risk of VTE by 4-fold to 5-fold. Thrombophilia and obstetric risk factors further increase the risk of pregnancy-related VTE. In women with a history of VTE, the risk of recurrence during pregnancy or post partum appears to be influenced by risk factors present during the first VTE. In most women with a history of VTE, antepartum and postpartum thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular- heparin is indicated. Women generally are affected by VTE at a younger age then men, and they have to deal with long-term complications (Post-thrombotic syndrome) of deep vein thrombosis early in life.© 2019 The Authors.

Using radioimmunoassay techniques, we measured levels of ethinyl estradiol (EE) and  (LNG). During the same cycle, women underwent twice-weekly sonography to assess ovarian follicular development and blood draws to measure endogenous estradiol (E2) and progesterone levels.Obese women had a lower area under the curve (AUC; 1077.2 vs. 1413.7 pg*h/mL) and lower maximum values (85.7 vs. 129.5 pg/mL) for EE than normal- women (p=.04 and <0.01, respectively); EE trough levels were similar between BMI groups. The similar, but smaller, differences in their LNG levels for AUC and maximum values (C(max)) were not statistically significant. While peak values differed somewhat, the LNG trough levels were similar for obese and normal- women (2.6 and 2.5 ng/mL, respectively). Women with greater EE AUC had smaller follicular diameters (p=.05) and lower E2 levels (p=.04). While follicular diameters tended to be larger among obese women, these differences were not statistically significant.OC hormone peak levels are lower among obese women compared to normal- women, but their trough levels are similar. In this small study, the observed PK differences did not translate into more ovarian follicular activity among obese OC users.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28693985>Cardiovascular risk markers among obese women using the -releasing intrauterine system: A randomised controlled trial.</a></h2><p>According to international guidelines, women with obesity without other comorbidities can safely use any hormonal contraceptive (HC). However, limited information is available about contraceptive safety for women with obesity since obesity is an exclusion criterion of most contraceptive clinical trials. As such little is known about the possible risks of HC exposure for women with obesity without comorbidities. One way to assess possible long-term risks in this population, even prior to the development of any clinical disease, is to measure alterations in subclinical atherosclerosis markers. We evaluated the effects of the -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) on subclinical markers of cardiovascular risk in women with obesity. This is a randomised clinical trial in which 106 women with obesity [ mass index (BMI)≥30kg/m] were randomised to the LNG-IUS (n=53) or to non-hormonal methods (n=53) and followed for 12 months. We evaluated waist circumference (WC), blood pressure, blood glucose, insulin, lipid profile, and endothelial function markers (carotid intima-media thickness, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, and carotid arterial stiffness). At 12 months, BMI (p=0.005), WC (p=0.045), and glucose levels (p=0.015) were significantly lower in the LNG-IUS group than in the control group. We did not find any clinically relevant changes in subclinical markers of cardiovascular risk among with obesity women at 12 months after LNG-IUS placement compared to users of non-hormonal contraceptive methods.ClinicalTrials.gov .Copyright © 2017 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.

Currently, all approved members of the class require administration by injection. Areas covered: This manuscript reviews oral semaglutide-an experimental GLP-1 receptor agonist in phase-3 clinical development. Available pharmacological and clinical data of the drug are reviewed, and important end-points described. Expert opinion: Oral peptide delivery has become possible with the discovery of absorption enhancers. The clinical development program of once-daily oral semaglutide has shown superiority in reducing glycosylated hemoglobin and  in comparison with placebo and active comparators (sitagliptin, liraglutide, and empagliflozin). Safety and tolerability of oral semaglutide is in line with injectable members of the class. Delayed gastric emptying, local increase in pH, and enhanced absorption do not seem to affect the exposure of a number of other oral drugs that have been tested (metformin, digoxin, oral contraceptive ethinylestradiol/, lisinopril, warfarin, furosemide and rosuvastatin). Clinical questions for further investigation include the effectiveness and safety of oral semaglutide in cardiovascular indications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21943687>Combined estrogen-progestogen but not progestogen-only oral contraceptive alters glucose tolerance and plasma lipid profile in female rats.</a></h2><p>Women are exposed to sex steroids in several formulations such as oral contraceptives (OCs) and hormone replacement therapies. Estrogen is believed to have cardiometabolic protection effect; but its beneficial effects have recently been queried. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether or not the altered glucose tolerance and plasma lipid profile was associated with OC and due to the estrogenic or progestogenic-component and if that was dose-dependent in 7-8 weeks old female rats. Rats were divided into vehicle-treated (control), high dose combined OC-treated (HCOC; receiving 1.5μg ethinyl estradiol/15.0μg norgestrel), low dose combined OC-treated (LCOC; receiving 0.15μg ethinyl estradiol/1.5μg norgestrel), high dose progestogen OC-treated (HOC; receiving 35.0μg ) and low dose progestogen OC-treated (LOC; receiving 3.5μg ) groups. Rats were given (p.o.) vehicle (distilled water), HCOC, LCOC, HOC and LOC daily for 6 weeks. When compared with the controls, HCOC treatment led to significant decreases in glucose tolerance and plasma high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. However, HCOC-treated and LCOC-treated groups had significantly higher plasma triglyceride levels when compared with the control group. Fasting blood glucose, plasma total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were comparable among groups.  gain appeared to be attenuated by OC treatments, particularly in LOC-treated rats. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that combined estrogen-progestogen but not progestogen-only OC use resulted in impaired glucose tolerance that was associated with increased triglyceride and decreased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. The effects on glucose tolerance and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were dose-dependent while that on triglyceride was not.Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

High-dosage parenteral testosterone (T) esters alone or in combination with a progestogen (eg, depot medroxyprogesterone) have been shown to confer effective and reversible male contraception in clinical trials, but these regimens are associated with  gain and suppression of serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels. We have previously demonstrated that intramuscular T enanthate 100 mg weekly plus oral  (LNG) 125, 250, or 500 microg daily suppresses spermatogenesis to levels associated with effective contraception, but there is a LNG-dosage-dependent effect of  gain and HDL suppression. We hypothesized that intramuscular T enanthate 100 mg weekly plus a very low dosage of oral LNG would effectively suppress spermatogenesis in normal men without inducing  gain or HDL suppression. We conducted a randomized trial comparing 6 months of intramuscular T enanthate (100 mg weekly) plus 31.25 microg of oral LNG daily (T+LNG 31; n = 20) or 62.5 microg of oral LNG daily (T+LNG 62; n = 21). The 2 regimens were equally effective in suppressing spermatogenesis to azoospermia, fewer than 1 million sperm/mL and fewer than 3 million sperm/mL (T+LNG 31 [60%, 85%, and 90%] vs T+LNG 62 [62%, 91%, and 95%] for azoospermia, fewer than 1 million and fewer than 3 million, respectively; P = NS). The T+LNG 31 group did not gain  (0.25 +/- 1.08 kg; P = NS compared with baseline), but the T+LNG 62 group gained 2.5 +/- 0.77 kg (P < .05 compared with baseline). Serum HDL cholesterol levels declined significantly in both groups (percentage decline month 6 of treatment vs baseline: 12.0% +/- 2.6% and 15.1% +/- 3.0%; P < .05 for T+LNG 31 and 62 respectively). Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels also declined in both groups (percentage decline month 6 of treatment vs baseline: 6.9 +/- 3.9 and 6.0% +/- 4.1%; P < .05 for T+LNG 31 and P = NS for T+LNG 62). There were no clinically significant adverse events or significant changes in hematology or chemistry profiles in either group during the study. We conclude that 1) intramuscular T plus oral LNG has a very potent synergistic effect in suppressing spermatogenesis at LNG dosages equal to or lower than dosages used in common female oral contraceptive regimens and 2) large, long-term contraceptive efficacy trials should be conducted with a variety of androgen-progestogen combinations including long-acting T formulations such as depot T pellets or intramuscular T undecanoate plus depot LNG or very low dosage oral LNG.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28144464>Effects of Second and Third Generation Oral Contraceptives on Lipid and Carbohydrate Metabolism in Overweight and Obese Women: A Randomized Triple-Blind Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) have not been shown to have major effects on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in normal- women. However, we have limited information about the effects on women at high risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes due to being overweight and obese.To evaluate the effects of second and third generation contraceptive pills on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in overweight and obese women.This triple-blind controlled trial was performed on 137 healthy women aged 18 - 40 years with a  mass index of 25-34.9 (kg/m) who were referred to health centers in Tabriz, Iran from 2014 to 2015. The women were randomly divided into groups who were to take 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol/150 mcg  (EE/LGN) (n = 69) or 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol/150 mcg desogestrel (EE/DSG) (n = 68) with an allocation ratio of 1: 1 for three cycles. As primary outcomes, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were assessed; total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and 2-hour plasma glucose in the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (2-hour 75-g OGTT) were assessed as secondary outcomes.The differences in lipid and carbohydrate parameters were not significant between the two groups, except for HDL-C (Adjusted MD (CI95%) = 7.00 (2.98 to 11.02)). HDL-C decreased with EE/LGN (P = 0.016) and increased with EE/DSG (P = 0.004). LDL-C and TC increased in both groups, whereas TG increased only with EE/DSG (P < 0.05). Compared with the baseline, FPG levels did not differ significantly in both groups, but EE/DSG increased 2-hour 75-g OGTT (P = 0.010).We observed no significant differences between the two groups in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, except for HDL-C. Considering the importance of overweight and obese women's health, studies with longer follow-up periods are recommended in this respect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26706662>Effect of oral versus intrauterine progestins on  in women undergoing fertility preserving therapy for complex atypical hyperplasia or endometrial cancer.</a></h2><p>The objective of this analysis was to evaluate  changes associated with oral progestin therapies versus the -containing intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) in women undergoing fertility-preserving therapy for complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH) and endometrial cancer (EMC).All patients diagnosed with CAH or EMC managed with fertility-preserving progestin therapy at two institutions from 1998 to 2012 were identified. Those with serial  measurements before, during and after therapy were included. Patients were categorized according to the type of progestin therapy administered. The rate of  change over time of patients treated with oral versus intrauterine progestins was compared using the Mann Whitney U test.Sixty patients with EMC (35) or CAH (25) were treated during the study period, with 12 patients receiving multiple regimens. These included megestrol acetate (MA, n=42), LNG-IUD (n=22), and other oral progestins (n=11). The median age at diagnosis was 32 and median pre-progestin  mass index (BMI) was 40.4kg/m(2). The median therapy duration was 11.7months [range: 2.3-118.5]. Median  change during therapy was greater with MA versus LNG-IUD (+2.95 vs. +0.05kg, P=0.03). Patients with a BMI<35 gained more  during therapy versus patients with BMI≥35 (+2.30 vs. -0.70kg/month, P=0.04); however, in patients with BMI≥35, MA was still associated with more  gain than LNG-IUD (+2.2 vs.-5.40kg, P=0.05).Oral progestin therapy for conservative treatment of young EMC/CAH survivors is associated with increased  gain, especially when megestrol acetate is utilized.

In this study, we have tried to assess some of the metabolic effects of three hormonal contraceptives commonly used by young females.Three hundred young, healthy, nonsmoking and normotensive women of childbearing age who were seeking contraceptive advice were randomly allocated to one of the three groups receiving ethinyl estradiol and norgestrel (group 1), medroxyprogesterone acetate (group 2), and  capsules (group 3). Levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), were measured prior to the initiation of therapy and after termination of the study (6 months).There was no significant difference between the three groups as far as the mean age, height and  were concerned. FBG increased in all three groups, but the difference in the rate of increase was not statistically significant (P=0.29). Total cholesterol, TG and LDL-C increased, while HDL-C level decreased in groups 1 and 2. These changes were, however, more profound in the group 2 cases. In those receiving , all lipid parameters decreased. The amount of change for the total cholesterol and triglyceride was quite significant (P<0.001), while the reduction in HDL-C was not significantly different from the other two groups by pairwise comparisons (Tukey-HSD procedure). The LDL-C/HDL-C ratio was found to be significantly increased in groups 1 and 2, but it remained almost unchanged in the group 3 cases (P<0.001).Because of these favorable biochemical findings, we believe that  should be the contraceptive drug of choice for women of childbearing age who are seeking a safe method of contraception.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818199>Toxic effects of single animal hormones and their mixtures on the growth of Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus armatus.</a></h2><p>In their environments, aquatic organisms are simultaneously exposed to mixtures of several endocrine disrupting compounds, including hormones. However, most of the toxicity studies so far focused on effects of single contaminants. The available information on the potential toxicity of combined hormones on microalgae is extremely limited. For these reasons the aim of this study was to evaluate the individual and mixture effect of estrone (E1), ß-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17-α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), progesterone (PRO), 5-pregnen-3β-ol-20-one (PRE),  (LG) and testosterone (TST) on Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus armatus. Green algae cells were exposed to different concentrations (0.1-100 mg L) of hormones for 14 days. Biomass in the form of dry  and chlorophyll a was examined. The decreasing order of toxicity (based on EC, 14d) to Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus armatus was: EE2>PRO > E2>PRE > TST > E3>LG > E1 and EE2>PRO > TST > E2>PRE > LG > E1>E3, respectively. Chlorella vulgaris was more sensitive to the effects of hormones than Scenedesmus armatus. Although mixed hormones were more toxic to green algae than single hormones, in the ecosystem mixtures can pose higher ecological risk than single pollutants. Therefore, data on the toxicology of both single and mixed hormones is very valuable for assessment of the possibility of adverse ecological effects caused by these pollutants. Furthermore, these results suggest that environmental exposure to hormone mixtures may cause toxicity levels different to the sum of those of the single hormones and provides a basic understanding of their toxic effect on algae.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed models were used to calculate empirical parameters describing drug diffusion and release. Observed correlations between empirical parameters and drug properties were used to develop equations to predict parameters based on drug properties. Predictive and empirical models were evaluated in the design of three prototype devices: a  matrix system for on-demand locally administered contraception, a timolol-maleate reservoir system for glaucoma treatment, and a primaquine-bisphosphate reservoir system for malaria prophylaxis.Proposed empirical equations accurately fit experimental data. Experimentally derived empirical parameters show significant correlations with LogP, molecular , and solubility. Empirical models based on predicted parameters accurately predict experimental release data for three prototype systems, demonstrating the accuracy and utility of these models.The proposed empirical models can be used to design polycaprolactone thin-film devices for target geometries and release rates. Empirical parameters can be predicted based on drug properties. Together, these models provide tools for preliminary evaluation and design of controlled-release delivery systems.Copyright © 2015.

We assessed study quality using the United States Preventive Services Task Force evidence grading system.We identified four pooled secondary analyses (quality: poor to fair), two of which examined UPA and three examined LNG formulations. Three analyses pooled overlapping data from a total of three primary studies and demonstrated significant associations between obesity and risk of pregnancy after ECP use. One analysis reported a 4-fold increased risk of pregnancy among women with obesity (BMI≥30kg/m) compared with women within normal/underweight categories (BMI<25kg/m) after use of LNG ECPs [odds ratio (OR) 4.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-9.4]. Further analysis of the same LNG data found that, at an approximate  of 80 kg, the rate of pregnancy rose above 6%, which is the estimated pregnancy probability without contraception; at  less than 75 kg, the rate of pregnancy was less than 2%. Two analyses examining UPA suggested an approximate 2-fold increased risk of pregnancy among women with obesity compared with either normal/underweight women or nonobese (BMI<30kg/m) women (OR 2.6; 95% CI 0.9-7.0 and OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.0-4.3, respectively), but CIs were wide. Finally, the fourth secondary analysis pooled data from three separate randomized controlled trials on LNG ECPs and found no increase in pregnancy risk with increasing  or BMI and found no consistent association between pregnancy and both factors when adjusted for other covariates.While data are limited and poor to fair quality, findings suggest that women with obesity experience an increased risk of pregnancy after use of LNG ECP compared with those normal/underweight. Women with obesity may also experience an increased risk of pregnancy compared with women without obesity after use of UPA ECP, though differences did not reach statistical significance. Providers should counsel all women at risk for unintended pregnancy, including those with obesity, about the effectiveness of the full range of emergency contraception options in order for them to understand their options, to receive advanced supplies of emergency contraception as needed and to understand how to access an emergency copper intrauterine device if desired.Copyright © 2016.

This was attributed to differences in drug crystallinity which increased in the order of crospovidone (crystal free)<MCC<titanium dioxide<no adsorbent and the water uptake which increased in the order of no adsorbent (0.1%)=titanium dioxide (0.1%)<MCC (1.6%)<crospovidone (4.8%) at 90% rh. Patches containing adsorbates onto crospovidone were investigated in detail. Increasing the adsorbate's drug loading increased the drug release up to a crospovidone content of 15% (w/w). Patches were crystal free for crospovidone contents ≥ 10% (w/w), which corresponds to a drug loading of crospovidone of 12% (w/w). In conclusion, the incorporation of drug adsorbates onto crospovidone into patches based on polyisobutene significantly increased the drug release (approximately 9.1 times for ethinyl estradiol and 15.4 times for ) and prevented drug recrystallization.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of obesity on incidence and survival were incorporated. The IUD was assumed to confer a 50% reduction in cancer incidence over 5 years. Costs of IUD and cancer care were included. Clinical outcomes were cancer diagnosis and deaths from cancer. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated in 2015 U.S. dollars per year of life saved. One-way and two-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo probabilistic analyses were performed.For a 50 year old with BMI 40 or greater, the IUD strategy is costlier and more effective than usual care with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $74,707 per year of life saved. If the protective effect of the  IUD is assumed to be 10 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio decreases to $37,858 per year of life saved. In sensitivity analysis, a  IUD that reduces cancer incidence by at least 68% in women with BMIs of 40 or greater or costs less than $500 is potentially cost-effective. For BMI 30 or greater, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of IUD strategy is $137,223 per year of life saved compared with usual care. In Monte Carlo analysis, IUD placement for BMI 40 or greater is cost-effective in 50% of simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per year of life saved.The  IUD is a potentially cost-effective strategy for prevention of deaths from endometrial cancer in obese women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26093190>Choice of the  intrauterine device, etonogestrel implant or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate for contraception after aspiration abortion.</a></h2><p>Women who have abortions are at high risk of contraception discontinuation and subsequent unintended pregnancy. The objective of this analysis was to identify factors associated with choice of highly effective, long-acting, progestin-only contraceptive methods after abortion.Women presenting for surgical abortion who selected the  intrauterine device (IUD), the progestin implant or the progestin injection (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate or DMPA) as their postabortion contraceptives were recruited to participate in a 1-year prospective cohort study. We used multivariable multinomial logistic regression to identify factors associated with choosing long-acting reversible contraceptives (IUD or implant) compared to DMPA.A total of 260 women, aged 18-45 years, enrolled in the study, 100 of whom chose the IUD, 63 the implant and 97 the DMPA. The women were 24.9 years old on average; 36% were black, and 29% were Latina. Fifty-nine percent had had a previous abortion, 66% a prior birth, and 55% were undergoing a second-trimester abortion. In multivariable analyses, compared with DMPA users, women who chose the IUD or the implant were less likely to be currently experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV); reported higher stress levels; weighed more; and were more likely to have finished high school, to have used the pill before and to report that counselors or doctors were helpful in making the decision (all significant at p<.05, see text for relative risk ratios and confidence intervals.) In addition, women who chose the IUD were less likely to be black (p<.01), and women who chose the implant were more likely to report that they would be unhappy to become pregnant within 6 months (p<.05) than DMPA users.A variety of factors including race/ethnicity, past contraceptive use, feelings towards pregnancy, stress and  were different between LARC and DMPA users. Notably, current IPV was associated with choice of DMPA over the IUD or implant, implying that a desire to choose a hidden method may be important to some women and should be included in counseling.In contraceptive counseling, after screening for IPV, assessing patient's stress and taking a history about past contraceptive use, clinicians should discuss whether these factors might affect a patient's choice of method.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Rates of contraceptive use are similar among women of all , but because contraceptive development studies historically excluded women over 130% of ideal , patients and providers have a gap in understanding of contraceptive efficacy for obese and overweight women. Because of a range of drug metabolism alterations in obesity, there is biologic plausibility for changes in hormonal contraception effectiveness in obese women. However, these pharmacokinetic changes are not linearly related to  mass index or , and it is unknown what degree of obesity begins to affect pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics processes. Overall, most studies of higher quality do not demonstrate a difference in oral contraceptive pill effectiveness in obese compared with non-obese women. However, data are scant for women in the highest categories of obesity, and differences by progestin type are incompletely understood. Effectiveness of most non-oral contraceptives does not seem to be compromised in obesity. Exceptions to this include the combined hormonal patch and oral  emergency contraception, which may have lower rates of effectiveness in obese women. The purpose of this review is to summarize evidence on contraceptive use in women with obesity, including differences in steroid hormone metabolism, contraceptive effectiveness, and safety, compared with women of normal  or  mass index using the same methods.Copyright © 2016 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

The reference lists of identified articles were reviewed for additional pertinent publications. Abstracts from the 2005 to 2011 American Society of Reproductive Medicine and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists meetings were searched using the same terms.The search provided 56 articles that addressed the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, and tolerability of E2V/DNG in women of reproductive age. Articles reporting efficacy or tolerability in the setting of menopause were excluded. The initial efficacy of E2V/DNG on ovulation inhibition was investigated in 2 prospective, randomized, open-label, Phase II dose-finding studies. The dose that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration resulted in 3.13% of women ovulating in the second cycle of treatment (90% CI, 0.2%-6.05%). Rate of pregnancy prevention with this agent was reported with a Pearl Index ranging from 0.73 to 1.27 (unadjusted) to 0.34 to 0.72 (adjusted for method failure only). The mean duration of withdrawal bleeding was 4.3 days (range, 4.0-4.6 days) among 2266 women receiving 13 treatment cycles. Adverse events reported in >1% of patients included abdominal pain, acne, breast pain, dysmenorrhea, emotional lability, headache, nausea, and  increase.Estradiol valerate/dienogest is a new contraceptive formulation. It offers efficacy, tolerability, and an acceptable safety profile with a potentially better bleeding pattern than -containing COCs. This COC may be especially useful for older women of reproductive age who are adherent to therapy and looking for shorter and/or lighter menstrual cycles. Studies will need to be performed to determine whether clinically significant differences in outcomes exist among E2V/DNG and other available COCs.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

Whilst abnormal menstrual bleeding may be associated with underlying pathology, in the present context, HMB is defined as excessive menstrual bleeding in the absence of other systemic or gynaecological disease. The first-line therapy is usually medical, avoiding possibly unnecessary surgery. Of the wide variety of medications used to reduce HMB, oral progestogens were originally the most commonly prescribed agents. This review assesses the effectiveness of two different types and regimens of oral progestogens in reducing ovulatory HMB.This is the update of a Cochrane review last updated in 2007, and originally named "Effectiveness of cyclical progestagen therapy in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding" (1998).To determine the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of oral progestogen therapy taken either during the luteal phase (short cycle) or for a longer course of 21 days per cycle (long cycle), in achieving a reduction in menstrual blood loss in women of reproductive age with HMB.In January 2019 we searched Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility's specialized register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycInfo. We also searched trials registers, other sources of unpublished or grey literature and reference lists of retrieved trials. We also checked citation lists of review articles to identify trials.Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatments for HMB that included cyclical oral progestogens were eligible.Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trials for risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted trial authors for clarification of methods or additional data when necessary. We only assessed adverse events if they were separately measured in the included trials. We compared cyclical oral progestogen in different regimens and placebo or other treatments. Our primary outcomes were menstrual blood loss and satisfaction with treatment; the secondary outcomes were number of days of bleeding, quality of life, compliance and acceptability of treatment, adverse events and costs.This review identified 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1071 women in total. Most of the women knew which treatment they were receiving, which may have influenced their judgements about menstrual blood loss and satisfaction. Other aspects of trial quality varied among trials.We did not identify any RCTs comparing progestogen treatment with placebo. We assessed comparisons between oral progestogens and other medical therapies separately according to different regimens.Short-cycle progestogen therapy during the luteal phase (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone for 7 to 10 days, from day 15 to 19) was inferior to other medical therapy, including tranexamic acid, danazol and the progestogen-releasing intrauterine system (Pg-IUS (off of the market since 2001)), releasing 60 mcg of progesterone daily, with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss (mean difference (MD) 37.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 17.67 to 56.91; I = 50%; 6 trials, 145 women). The rate of satisfaction and the quality of life with treatment was similar in both groups. The number of bleeding days was greater on the short cycle progestogen group compared to other medical treatments. Adverse events (such as gastrointestinal symptoms and  gain) were more likely with danazol when compared with progestogen treatment. We note that danazol is no longer in general use for treating HMB.Long-cycle progestogen therapy (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone), from day 5 to day 26 of the menstrual cycle, is also inferior to the -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), releasing tranexamic acid and ormeloxifene, but may be similar to the combined vaginal ring with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss (MD 16.88, 95% CI 10.93 to 22.84; I = 87%; 4 trials, 355 women). A higher proportion of women taking norethisterone found their treatment unacceptable compared to women having Pg-IUS (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.12, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.40; 1 trial, 40 women). However, the adverse effects of breast tenderness and intermenstrual bleeding were more likely in women with the LNG-IUS. No trials reported on days of bleeding or quality of life for this comparison.The evidence supporting these findings was limited by low or very low gradings of quality; thus, we are uncertain about the findings and there is a potential that they may change if we identify other trials.Low- or very low-quality evidence suggests that short-course progestogen was inferior to other medical therapy, including tranexamic acid, danazol and the Pg-IUS with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss. Long cycle progestogen therapy (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone) was also inferior to the LNG-IUS, tranexamic acid and ormeloxifene, but may be similar to the combined vaginal ring with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24183329>Oral anticoagulant therapy does not modify the bleeding pattern associated with the -releasing intrauterine system in women with thrombophilia and/or a history of thrombosis.</a></h2><p>Progestogen-only contraceptives (POCs) are suitable for women with thrombophilia and/or a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Several of these women, however, use oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT), which can impair the bleeding pattern associated with POC use. We evaluated the effects of OAT use on the bleeding pattern associated with the -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) in women with thrombophilia and/or a history of VTE.This prospective cohort study followed two groups of women, all of whom were thrombophilic and/or had a history of VTE: OAT users and nonusers. Bleeding patterns, blood pressure,  mass index (BMI), , complete blood count and waist circumference were compared between the two groups before and 6 and 12 months after LNG-IUS insertion.The patient cohort consisted of 33 women aged 18 to 45 years old, including 16 OAT users and 17 nonusers.  increased by 3.9% and BMI by 3.8% in OAT users 12 months after LNG-IUS insertion. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels increased by approximately 10% in both groups. There was no difference between the groups in bleeding patterns, with amenorrhea being the most frequent pattern in both groups (41.2% each) 12 months after LNG-IUS insertion. OAT did not increase the frequency of prolonged and/or frequent bleeding.OAT users and nonusers had similar bleeding patterns after insertion of the LNG-IUS. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels increased in both groups.© 2013.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27002603>Emergency Contraception: Two Steps Forward, One Step Back.</a></h2><p>Emergency contraceptives can prevent pregnancy, when used after unprotected sex around the time of ovulation. In the past 15 years, access to emergency contraception (EC) in the United States has increased and more women use it. Emerging data may tailor EC prescribing based on patient  and starting other contraception. There are several EC options-oral  and oral ulipristal acetate and the copper intrauterine device. Ideally, women should have EC access at low or no cost. Yet, several barriers-limited patient and provider knowledge about EC, cost, EC stocking practices, and state and federal laws exempting providers from supplying EC-make it difficult to integrate this time-sensitive treatment into women's reproductive health care.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27000996>Impact of obesity on the pharmacokinetics of -based emergency contraception: single and double dosing.</a></h2><p>To determine if differences exist in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of -based emergency contraception (LNG-EC) in obese and normal  mass index (BMI) users and test whether doubling the dose of LNG-EC in obese women increases total and free (active) LNG serum concentrations.Healthy, reproductive-age women with obese and normal BMIs received 1.5mg LNG orally (ECx1) and then in a subsequent menstrual cycle, the obese group also received 3mg LNG (ECx2). Dosing occurred during the follicular phase. Total and free LNG PK parameters were obtained via serum samples through an indwelling catheter at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5h. The primary outcome was the difference in total and free LNG concentration maximum (Cmax) between ECx1 and ECx2 in the obese group.A total of 10 women enrolled and completed the study (normal BMI=5, median 22.8kg/m(2), range 20.8-23.7; obese BMI=5, 39.5kg/m(2), range 35.9-46.7). The total LNG Cmax for obese subjects following ECx1 (5.57±2.48ng/mL) was significantly lower than the level observed in normal BMI women (10.30±2.47, p=.027). Notably, ECx2 increased the Cmax significantly (10.52±2.76, p=.002); approximating the level in normal BMI subjects receiving ECx1. Free LNG Cmax followed a similar pattern.Obesity adversely impacts both the total and free Cmax levels of LNG EC and this likely explains its lack of efficacy in obese women. Doubling the dose appears to correct the obesity-related PK changes but additional research is needed to determine if this also improves EC effectiveness in obese women.This study demonstrates that obesity interferes with the pharmacokinetics of LNG EC, and that doubling the dose may be an effective strategy to improve its efficacy in obese women.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Currently, lower-dose ethinyl estradiol formulations are most commonly prescribed, although they have been linked to increased arterial vascular risk. The aim of this study was to investigate endothelial function in healthy young women using lower-dose ethinyl estradiol OCPs. We examined flow-mediated, endothelium-dependent and nitroglycerin-mediated, endothelium-independent vasodilation of the brachial artery, comparing two doses of ethinyl estradiol/ OCPs in 15 healthy young women on two study days: once during the active phase and once during the placebo phase of an OCP cycle. Group low dose (LD) (n=7) active pills contained 150 microg /30 microg ethinyl estradiol versus Group very low dose (VLD) (n=8) with 100 microg /20 microg ethinyl estradiol. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was lower during the active phase in Group VLD (5.33 +/- 1.77% vs. 7.23 +/- 2.60%; P=0.024). This phase difference was not observed in Group LD (8.00 +/- 0.970% vs. 7.61 +/- 1.07%; P=0.647). Endothelium-independent vasodilation did not differ between phases in either group. Finally, we measured endothelium-dependent vasodilation in two additional women who received 10 microg of unopposed ethinyl estradiol. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was increased by unopposed ethinyl estradiol compared with the placebo phase (10.88 +/- 2.34% vs. 6.97 +/- 1.83%).

Serum levels of EE, LNG, sex hormone-binding globulin and progesterone were compared in 41 obese [ mass index (BMI) ≥30] and 75 nonobese (BMI <30) women.Suppression of ovulation during the luteal phase was dose dependent, with the highest dose (AG200-15) preventing progesterone increases in all women (cycles 2-3). In the follicular phase, the lowest-dose patch had the highest rate of increased progesterone in nonobese subjects. Progesterone levels ≥3.0 ng/mL in the follicular phase were more common in obese than nonobese women.AG200-15 suppresses ovulation in obese and nonobese women. All three patches found increased progesterone in the follicular phase, albeit more in obese versus nonobese women.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The progestin-only pills (Micronor and Ovrette), depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) injections (Depo-Provera and depo-subQ provera 104),  intrauterine system (IUS) (Mirena), and etonogestrel implant (Implanon) will be reviewed. The use of  (Plan B) as an emergency contraceptive will also be considered briefly.Worldwide medical literature and the prescribing information for the specified products.A number of POCs are currently available for routine birth control in the United States, ranging from the daily progestin-only pill to nondaily contraceptive options such as injectable DMPA, the -releasing IUS, and the etonogestrel-releasing contraceptive implant. Each of these methods has specific advantages, but also specific drawbacks that can result in discontinuation of treatment if users are not given adequate information about what to expect in terms of side effects. It is critical that clinicians provide adequate and accurate information along with detailed counseling to women who are considering using POCs, as well as providing periodic reinforcement of the information at regular clinic visits for those already using POCs.Given that a large number of pregnancies are unplanned and create a significant impact on social, economic, and health outcomes, it is important for the clinician to have a vast knowledge of contraceptive options. POCs offer significant choices in contraception. By proactively addressing common concerns (such as potential effects on , mood, menstrual bleeding patterns, and bone mineral density), clinicians may improve the likelihood of adherence and continuation with POCs for routine birth control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15579768>Coexpression of fractalkine and its receptor in normal human endometrium and in endometrium from users of progestin-only contraception supports a role for fractalkine in leukocyte recruitment and endometrial remodeling.</a></h2><p>Leukocytes are critical mediators of endometrial remodeling, but the mechanisms by which leukocyte subpopulations enter the uterus are currently unknown. Endometrial leukocytes have no genomic progesterone receptors; thus, we hypothesized that leukocyte migration is induced indirectly by progesterone-regulated chemokines. Fractalkine (CX3CL1), a chemotactic membrane-bound adhesion factor, and its receptor (CX3CR1) were assessed by immunohistochemistry in endometrial samples across the menstrual cycle, in early pregnancy, and in women using progestin-only contraceptives. Fractalkine was localized predominantly to glandular epithelial and decidualized stromal cells, with the highest staining intensity in the secretory phase and early pregnancy. It was also detected in subpopulations of endometrial leukocytes (macrophages and uterine NK cells), with maximal numbers during the proliferative phase and early pregnancy. CX3CR1 was similarly colocalized to the glandular epithelium and decidualized stromal cells, with the highest expression in the secretory phase. CX3CR1-positive leukocytes (macrophages and neutrophils) were in greatest abundance during the menstrual phase. In the endometrium of women using progestin-only contraceptives, immunoreactive fractalkine was markedly reduced in the glandular epithelium, but was increased in decidualized stroma and infiltrating leukocytes. These findings support a number of roles for fractalkine in the endometrium, in the secretory phase, in early pregnancy, and when influenced by progestin-only contraceptives.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22333097>[Clinic observation of a -releasing intrauterine system inserted immediately after artificial abortion].</a></h2><p>To compare the contraceptive efficacies and side effects of Mirena (-releasing intrauterine system, LNG-IUS) inserted immediately after artificial abortion and in the period of regular menstruation.A total of 166 female subjects volunteered for the insertion of LNG-IUS. They were divided into 2 groups. Eighty-six female subjects inserted right after artificial abortion were selected as the observation group and 80 female subjects inserted during the period of regular menstruation as the control group. Follow-up was performed at one year after insertion. Contraceptive efficacies and side effects were compared between two groups.No pregnancy was found in both groups. No mirena expulsion occurred in neither groups. The continuation rates were 100%and 95%in the observation and control groups respectively (P > 0.05). The rates of abnormal hemorrhage were 27.5% and 36.2% in observation and control groups respectively during the first three months (P < 0.05). And 22.7% and 23.3% subjects suffered amenorrhea respectively in the first year. No significant difference was found in such side effects as amenorrhea,  gain, acne and swollen breasts between two groups (P > 0.05).Mirena is proved to be an excellent choice for contraception after artificial abortion. Secondary intrauterine surgery may be avoided. And its insertions immediately after artificial abortion or during the period of regular menstruation share the same efficacies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519253>Ratio-dependent effects of quinestrol and  compounds (EP-1) on reproductive parameters of adult male Swiss mice.</a></h2><p>Fertility control is considered as the second-generation pest rodent management strategy. Most previous studies have focused on the dosage-dependent effects of quinestrol and  compounds (EP-1) at a ratio of 1:2, but the ratio-dependent effects of EP-1 have not been fully investigated, especially in male rodents. To test the ratio-dependent antifertility effects of EP-1 with different ratios (1:2, 1:1, and 2:1) on male Swiss outbred strain of laboratory mice, forty male mice were randomly assigned into four groups (n = 10). Mice in the three treatment groups were provided one of the three EP-1 mixture compounds for 3 successive days via gavage at a dosage of 50 mg/kg, and then all mice were sacrificed 15 days after the gavage treatment. Reproductive organ , sperm density and motility, levels of testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in serum and/or testis, and androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor α (ERα), estrogen receptor β (ERβ), luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR), and aromatase in testis were determined. Each of the ratios of quinestrol and  significantly decreased the density and motility of sperm and induced atrophy of the epididymis and seminal vesicle. The combination of compounds also significantly reduced serum T and LH levels, increased testicular T levels and decreased testicular estradiol ERβ and aromatase levels. EP-1 delivered at a ratio of 1:1 induced the most significant effects on the reproductive parameters assessed and shows the potential for use in fertility control of male rodents.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Pregnancy rates were also low in women weighing over 80kg (0.7%) and who were obese (BMI over 30kg/m) (2.0%). The pooled analyses for pregnancy demonstrated that BMI over 30kg/m decreased efficacy significantly (odds ratio 8.27, 95% confidence interval = 2.70-25.37) when compared to women in lower BMI categories, mainly influenced by pregnancies in obese women from one study site. Sensitivity analyses excluding that site showed that obesity was no longer a risk factor; however, the other studies included too few obese women in the sample to exclude a substantial decrease in efficacy.Pregnancy rates with use of LNG 1.5mg for EC were low at less than 3% across different  and BMI categories. Pooled analyses showed an increase in pregnancy rates among obese women (BMI more than 30kg/m) compared to women with normal BMI levels, influenced by pregnancies all coming from one study site.Access to LNG as EC should still be promoted to women who need them, and not be restricted in any  or BMI category, with additional attention for counselling and advice for obese women.Copyright Â© 2016.

Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies published in English from January 1994 to January 2015. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to June 2015. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies.The quality of the evidence in this document was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table). Chapter 1: Contraception in Canada Summary Statements  1. Canadian women spend a significant portion of their lives at risk of an unintended pregnancy. (II-2)  2. Effective contraceptive methods are underutilized in Canada, particularly among vulnerable populations. (II-2)  3. Long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, including contraceptive implants and intrauterine contraception (copper-releasing and -releasing devices/systems), are the most effective reversible contraceptive methods and have the highest continuation rates. (II-1)  4. Canada currently does not collect reliable data to determine the use of contraceptive methods, abortion rates, and the prevalence of unintended pregnancy among reproductive-age women. (II-2)  5. A universal subsidy for contraceptive methods as provided by many of Canada's peer nations and a few Canadian provinces may produce health system cost-savings. (II-2)  6. Health Canada approval processes for contraceptives have been less efficient than those of other drug approval agencies and Health Canada processes for other classes of pharmaceuticals. (II-2)  7. It is feasible and safe for contraceptives and family planning services to be provided by appropriately trained allied health professionals such as midwives, registered nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists. (II-2) Recommendations 1. Contraceptive counselling should include a discussion of typical use failure rates and the importance of using the contraceptive method consistently and correctly in order to avoid pregnancy. (II-2A) 2. Women seeking contraception should be counselled on the wide range of effective methods of contraception available, including long-acting reversible contraceptive methods (LARCs). LARCs are the most effective methods of reversible contraception, have high continuation rates, and should be considered when presenting contraceptive options to any woman of reproductive age. (II-2A) 3. Family planning counselling should include counselling on the decline of fertility associated with increasing female age. (III-A) 4. Health policy supporting a universal contraception subsidy and strategies to promote the uptake of highly effective methods as cost-saving  that improve health and health equity should be considered by Canadian health decision makers. (III-B) 5. Canadian health jurisdictions should consider expanding the scope of practice of other trained professionals such as nurses, nurse practitioners, midwives, and pharmacists and promoting task-sharing in family planning. (II-2B) 6. The Canadian Community Health Survey should include adequate reproductive health indicators in order for health care providers and policy makers to make appropriate decisions regarding reproductive health policies and services in Canada. (III-B) 7. Health Canada processes and policies should be reviewed to ensure a wide range of modern contraceptive methods are available to Canadian women. (III-B) Chapter 2: Contraceptive Care and Access Summary Statements  8. Although there are many contraceptive options in Canada, only a narrow range of contraceptive methods are commonly used by those of reproductive age. (II-3)  9. Condom use decreases with longer relationship tenure and when the sexual partner is considered to be the main partner, likely due to a lower perceived risk of sexually transmitted infection in that relationship. Condom use may also decrease markedly as an unintended consequence when an effective non-barrier method, such as hormonal contraception or intrauterine contraception, is initiated. (II-3) 10. Family planning counselling provides a natural segue into screening for concerns about sexual function or intimate partner violence. (III) 11. Well-informed and well-motivated individuals who have developed skills to practise safer sex behaviours are more likely to use contraceptive and safer sex methods effectively and consistently. (II-2) Recommendations 8. Comprehensive family planning services, including abortion services, should be accessible to all Canadians regardless of geographic location. These services should be confidential, non-judgemental, and respectful of individuals' privacy and cultural contexts. (III-A) 9. A contraceptive visit should include history taking, screening for contraindications, dispensing or prescribing a method of contraception, and exploring contraceptive choice and adherence in the broader context of the individual's sexual behaviour, reproductive health risk, social circumstances, and relevant belief systems. (III-B) 10. Health care providers should provide practical information on the wide range of contraceptive options and their potential non-contraceptive benefits and assist women and their partners in determining the best user-method fit. (III-B) 11. Health care providers should assist women and men in developing the skills necessary to negotiate the use of contraception and the correct and consistent use of a chosen method. (III-B) 12. Contraceptive care should include discussion and management of the risk of sexually transmitted infection, including appropriate recommendations for condom use and dual protection, STI screening, post-exposure prophylaxis, and Hepatitis B and human papillomavirus vaccination. (III-B) 13. Health care providers should emphasize the use of condoms not only for protection against sexually transmitted infection, but also as a back-up method when adherence to a hormonal contraceptive may be suboptimal. (I-A) 14. Health care providers should be aware of current media controversies in reproductive health and acquire relevant evidence-based information that can be briefly and directly communicated to their patients. (III-B) 15. Referral resources for intimate partner violence, sexually transmitted infections, sexual dysfunction, induced abortion services, and child protection services should be available to help clinicians provide contraceptive care in the broader context of women's health. (III-B) Chapter 3: Emergency Contraception Summary Statements 12. The copper intrauterine device is the most effective method of emergency contraception. (II-2) 13. A copper intrauterine device can be used for emergency contraception up to 7 days after unprotected intercourse provided that pregnancy has been ruled out and there are no other contraindications to its insertion. (II-2) 14.  emergency contraception is effective up to 5 days (120 hours) after intercourse; its effectiveness decreases as the time between unprotected intercourse and ingestion increases. (II-2) 15. Ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception is more effective than  emergency contraception up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse. This difference in effectiveness is more pronounced as the time from unprotected intercourse increases, especially after 72 hours. (I) 16. Hormonal emergency contraception ( emergency contraception and ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception) is not effective if taken on the day of ovulation or after ovulation. (II-2) 17.  emergency contraception may be less effective in women with a  mass index > 25 kg/m2 and ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception may be less effective in women with a  mass index > 35 kg/m2. However, hormonal emergency contraception may still retain some effectiveness regardless of a woman's  or  mass index. (II-2) 18. Hormonal emergency contraception is associated with higher failure rates when women continue to have subsequent unprotected intercourse. (II-2) 19. Hormonal contraception can be initiated the day of or the day following the use of  emergency contraception, with back-up contraception used for the first 7 days. (III) 20. Hormonal contraception can be initiated 5 days following the use of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception, with back-up contraception used for the first 14 days. (III) Recommendations 16. All emergency contraception should be initiated as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse. (II-2A) 17. Women should be informed that the copper intrauterine device (IUD) is the most effective method of emergency contraception and can be used by any woman with no contraindications to IUD use.

The ENG-implant has both well established safety and efficacy for up to 3 years. Pharmacokinetic data on ENG show high levels at 3 years and some previous clinical research confirms efficacy beyond the current approved duration of 3 years. Today, many women, because the labeled duration has been reached, have the ENG implant removed at 3 years, increasing costs, inconvenience and risks.For the first 3 years, this study was an open-label, multi-centre randomized trial comparing the 3-year ENG implant to the 5-year  (LNG)-releasing implant. After 3 years, a subset of 390 ENG participants, consented to extended use. We compared efficacy, side effects and removal procedures of both implants. We used Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis. We included an observational cohort of copper intrauterine device (IUD) users as non-users of hormonal contraceptive method for comparative purposes.The study took place in family planning clinics in seven countries worldwide. Women were enlisted after an eligibility check and informed consent, and 1328 women were enrolled: 390, 522 and 416 in the ENG-implant, LNG-implant and IUD groups, respectively.Over 200 women used the ENG implant for at least 5 years. No pregnancies occurred during the additional 2 years of follow up in the ENG or LNG implant group. The overall 5-year K-M cumulative pregnancy rates for ENG- and LNG- implants were 0.6 per 100 women-years (W-Y) [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.2-1.8] and 0.8 per 100 W-Y [95% CI: 0.2-2.3], respectively. Complaints of bleeding changes were similar; however, ENG-users were more likely than LNG-users to experience heavy bleeding (p < 0.05). The median duration of the implant removal procedure was 64 seconds shorter for the one-rod ENG-implant (inter-quartile range (IQR) = 30.5, 117.5) compared to the two-rod LNG product (IQR = 77.0, 180.0). The 2-year rate for pregnancy in the IUD group compared with the two implant groups combined was 4.1 per 100 W-Y [95% CI: 2.5-6.5].Few women were ≤19 years old or nulligravida. Although there was no  limit for enrolment in the study, the number of women ≥70 kg were few.The results from this study corroborate previous evidence showing high contraceptive efficacy through 4 years for the ENG-implant. Data through 5 years are a novel contribution and further proof of the product's capability to provide safe and effective contraception that rivals the current 5-year LNG-subdermal implant. The findings provide valuable information for policy makers, family planning programmers and clinicians that the ENG-releasing subdermal implant is still highly effective up to 5 years after insertion. Compared to previous efforts, our study population was geographically diverse and our study had the highest number of participants completing at least 5 years of use.The trial was registered as ISRCTN33378571.The contraceptive devices and funds for conduct of the study were provided by the United Nations Development Programme/United Nations Population Fund/World Health Organization (WHO)/UNICEF/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), Department of Reproductive Health and Research (RHR), WHO.

Both with and without APC, plasmas of OC users exhibited the shortest lag time and time to peak, and the highest peak height and ETP. In the absence of APC none of these parameters differed between users of OC containing different progestogens. In contrast, in the presence of APC shorter lag times and time to peak, and higher peak height and ETP were observed in plasma of users of gestodene-, desogestrel-, drospirenone- and cyproterone acetate-containing OC than in plasma of users of - containing OC. The ETP determined in the absence of APC (ETP(-APC)) had no predictive value for the APCsr (r = 0.11; slope 0.9 x 10(-3); 95% CI: -0.1 x 10(-3) to 2.0 x 10(-3)) whereas the ETP measured in the presence of APC (ETP+APC) showed an excellent correlation with the APCsr (r = 0.95; slope 6.6 x 10(-3); 95% CI: 6.3 x 10(-3) to 6.9 x 10(-3)) indicating that the APCsr is entirely determined by the ETP+APC. In conclusion, OC use increases thrombin generation, but differential effects of second and third generation OCs on the protein C system likely determine the differences in the risk of venous thrombosis between these kinds of OC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21848413>Amenorrhea and BMI as independent determinants of patient satisfaction in LNG-IUD users: cross-sectional study in a Central European district.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the satisfaction of women carrying the LNG-IUD and determined influencing factors, especially considering bleeding patterns and  mass index (BMI).Cross sectional study.Gynecological offices in a Central European district.1825 women aged between 18 and 60 years.While sitting in the waiting room, voluntary patients had to answer a questionnaire about their experiences with the  intrauterine device. One question was used to determine whether the women were current, former or not users of the intrauterine coil.415 women who had some experiences with Mirena were found. Overall, 266 (65.7%) were "very satisfied," 83 (20.5%) "quite satisfied," 18 (4.4%) "moderate satisfied," 19 (4.7%) "less satisfied," and the same amount "really not satisfied" with the hormonal coil. Women with amenorrhea were more often "very satisfied" in general, than women with hypermenorrhea (178 (67.9%) vs. 3 (1.1%) p < 0.001). Concerning bleeding patterns, 295 (74.1%) were "very satisfied" and 23 (5.8%) "really not satisfied". 203 (91.0%) of all amenorrhoeic women were "very satisfied" with their bleeding patterns, but only 2 (9.5%) of all women with hypermenorrhea (p < 0.001 for α = 0.05). Amenorrhea particularly occurred in women who had a significantly lower  mass index (24.4 ± 4.4 kg/m(2) vs. 27.6 ± 6.5 kg/m(2) in women with hypermenorrhea, p = 0.018 for α = 0.05). After allocating women to the widely used BMI-categories (underweight, normal , overweight, obese class I and II) it was evident, that normally weighted women tend toward amenorrhea as well at the beginning of LNG-IUD use as well after 4-5 years of use. In contrast to this, overweighed and obese women tend more often to amenorrhea at the end of use, but not at the beginning (72.7% and 55.6% vs. 25.0% and 0%). Women with a lower BMI were more often "very satisfied" concerning bleeding patterns, but not concerning the general satisfaction.Our study showed much evidence, that amenorrhea occurs more often in women with lower BMI contrary to women with a higher one-especially at the beginning of LNG- IUD use. Furthermore amenorrhea was mostly considered to be a positive menstrual change.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28757409>Beyond Plan B: A Qualitative Study of Canadian Pharmacists' Emergency Contraception Counselling Practices.</a></h2><p>Pharmacists are often the front-line health care providers for women seeking emergency contraception (EC). This study explored Ontario pharmacists' EC counselling practices and their perceived barriers to recommending the most effective EC method, the copper IUD (Cu-IUD).This qualitative study used one-on-one, semistructured interviews with 20 pharmacists working in pharmacies located within a 1-km radius of a large sexual health clinic that offered postcoital IUDs in downtown Toronto.All pharmacists provided counselling about  (LNG-EC), and all considered it important. Nevertheless, they rarely discussed the Cu-IUD, even in circumstances where LNG-EC could be less effective, such as delayed presentation or for women with BMI >25 kg/m. Some pharmacists felt conflicted in their dual roles as health care and customer service provider when counselling about and selling EC, and many felt uncomfortable discussing . Pharmacists were not well informed about the Cu-IUD. They identified many pharmacist-specific barriers to counselling about the Cu-IUD for EC, as well as health systems issues around Cu-IUD provision and insertion.Ontario pharmacists embraced their role in EC counselling, yet their discussions rarely included the most effective Cu-IUD option. Educating and training pharmacists about the Cu-IUD and establishing referral pathways for IUD insertion could expand their counselling about this EC option.Copyright © 2017 The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada/La Société des obstétriciens et gynécologues du Canada.

Our aim in this study was to describe patterns of contraceptive use before and after gastric bypass in Sweden, and to describe the contraceptive counseling given preoperatively to women undergoing gastric bypass.In October 2012, a questionnaire was sent to 1000 Swedish women who all had undergone gastric bypass during 2010. The women had been included in the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Register at time of surgery. The main outcome  were patterns of use of contraception before and after bariatric surgery.The response rate was 57 %. The most commonly used contraceptive methods were intrauterine devices, 29 % preoperatively and 26 % postoperatively even though there was a postoperative switch from the copper intrauterine device to the  intrauterine system. Thirty percent did not use any contraceptive during the first 12 months after surgery. Sixty percent of the responders were aware of the recommendations to avoid pregnancy after surgery.Many women who undergo bariatric surgery are not using any contraceptive method despite the recommendation that they should avoid pregnancy for at least 12 months.

Ethinyl estradiol (EE2) induces increases in hepatic binding globulin (BG) levels. Measuring these BG increases may provide an effective and convenient approach to distinguish noncompliant from compliant OCP users in research settings. This analysis evaluated the usefulness of measuring increases in corticosteroid-, sex-hormone- and thyroxine-binding globulins (CBG, SHBG and TBG, respectively) as  of OCP compliance.We used frozen serum from a trial that compared ovarian suppression between normal- and obese women randomized to one of two OCPs containing EE2 and  (LNG). Based on serial LNG measurements during the trial, 17% of participants were noncompliant. We matched noncompliant participants with compliant participants by age,  mass index, ethnicity and OCP formulation. We measured CBG, SHBG and TBG levels and compared change from baseline to 3-month follow-up between the noncompliant and compliant participants. Construction of receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves allowed comparison of various BG .Changes in CBG and TBG distinguished OCP noncompliant users from compliant users [area under the ROC curve (AUROC), 0.86 and 0.89, p<.01]. Changes in SHBG were less discriminating (AUROC 0.69)EE2-induced increases in CBG and TBG provide a sensitive integrated marker of compliance with an LNG-containing OCP.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The absolute risk of VTE in users of combined oral contraceptives is 20-30 per 100000 women years. A number of case-control studies published in recent years have shown an apparent increase in the risk of VTE among users of oral contraceptives (OCs) containing desogestrel, gestodene, drospirenone and cyproterone, relative to the use of . The data derived from these recent studies is of borderline statistical significance because any important factors are not considered to evaluate the real correlation between the assumption of OCs and risk of venous thromboembolism. Among the factors that should be considered, there are: EE dose, duration of use, coexistance of other risk factors of venous thromboembolism (age, BMI, familiarity, surgical interventions) and other prescription bias. The lack of these factors is likely to contribute to the increased risk of venous thromboembolism observed in users of third-generation OCs when compared to that in users of second-generation OCs.

The aim of this study was to describe the main variables (effectiveness, tolerability, menstrual bleeding) associated with the use of subdermal contraceptive implants and to investigate the influence of age on these variables. This was a descriptive, retrospective, observational study of 221 cases of contraceptive implants inserted at a Spanish hospital between 2006 and 2015. The mean age of implant users was 31.2 ± 7.5 years. Effectiveness was 100% and good tolerability was recorded for 86.5%. Infrequent bleeding was the most common bleeding pattern, followed by amenorrhoea. Of the 221 implants inserted, 47.5% were removed. The main reasons were expiration (54.3%) and discomfort due to bleeding alterations and other adverse effects (25.7%). Nulliparity and  gain were significantly associated with an increased probability of implant removal. This study shows that implants were highly effective, safe and well-tolerated in our population. The age of users had no influence on any of the study variables analysed. Impact Statement What is already known on this subject? Subdermal contraceptive implants are long-acting reversible contraceptives which are both safe and effective. What do the results of this study add? The age of users had no influence on any of the study variables analysed. Nulliparity and  gain were significantly associated with an increased probability of implant removal. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Subdermal contraceptive implants were a safe and effective long-acting progestin contraceptive method for women from all age groups in our series because no significant age-related differences were observed for the tolerability, vaginal bleeding patterns, the effectiveness, the adverse effects or any other variables.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26606712>Canadian Contraception Consensus (Part 1 of 4).</a></h2><p>To provide guidelines for health care providers on the use of contraceptive methods to prevent pregnancy and on the promotion of healthy sexuality.Guidance for Canadian practitioners on overall effectiveness, mechanism of action, indications, contraindications, non-contraceptive benefits, side effects and risks, and initiation of cited contraceptive methods; family planning in the context of sexual health and general well-being; contraceptive counselling methods; and access to, and availability of, cited contraceptive methods in Canada.Published literature was retrieved through searches of Medline and The Cochrane Database from January 1994 to January 2015 using appropriate controlled vocabulary (e.g., contraception, sexuality, sexual health) and key words (e.g., contraception, family planning, hormonal contraception, emergency contraception).

Chapter 1: Contraception in Canada Summary Statements 1. Canadian women spend a significant portion of their lives at risk of an unintended pregnancy. (II-2) 2. Effective contraceptive methods are underutilized in Canada, particularly among vulnerable populations. (II-2) 3. Long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, including contraceptive implants and intrauterine contraception (copper-releasing and -releasing devices/systems), are the most effective reversible contraceptive methods and have the highest continuation rates. (II-1) 4. Canada currently does not collect reliable data to determine the use of contraceptive methods, abortion rates, and the prevalence of unintended pregnancy among reproductive-age women. (II-2) 5. A universal subsidy for contraceptive methods as provided by many of Canada's peer nations and a few Canadian provinces may produce health system cost-savings. (II-2) 6. Health Canada approval processes for contraceptives have been less efficient than those of other drug approval agencies and Health Canada processes for other classes of pharmaceuticals. (II-2) 7. It is feasible and safe for contraceptives and family planning services to be provided by appropriately trained allied health professionals such as midwives, registered nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists. (II-2) Recommendations 1. Contraceptive counselling should include a discussion of typical use failure rates and the importance of using the contraceptive method consistently and correctly in order to avoid pregnancy. (II-2A) 2. Women seeking contraception should be counselled on the wide range of effective methods of contraception available, including long-acting reversible contraceptive methods (LARCs). LARCs are the most effective methods of reversible contraception, have high continuation rates, and should be considered when presenting contraceptive options to any woman of reproductive age. (II-2A) 3. Family planning counselling should include counselling on the decline of fertility associated with increasing female age. (III-A) 4. Health policy supporting a universal contraception subsidy and strategies to promote the uptake of highly effective methods as cost-saving  that improve health and health equity should be considered by Canadian health decision makers. (III-B) 5. Canadian health jurisdictions should consider expanding the scope of practice of other trained professionals such as nurses, nurse practitioners, midwives, and pharmacists and promoting task-sharing in family planning. (II-2B) 6. The Canadian Community Health Survey should include adequate reproductive health indicators in order for health care providers and policy makers to make appropriate decisions regarding reproductive health policies and services in Canada. (III-B) 7. Health Canada processes and policies should be reviewed to ensure a wide range of modern contraceptive methods are available to Canadian women. (III-B) Chapter 2: Contraceptive Care and Access Summary Statements 8. Although there are many contraceptive options in Canada, only a narrow range of contraceptive methods are commonly used by those of reproductive age. (II-3) 9. Condom use decreases with longer relationship tenure and when the sexual partner is considered to be the main partner, likely due to a lower perceived risk of sexually transmitted infection in that relationship. Condom use may also decrease markedly as an unintended consequence when an effective non-barrier method, such as hormonal contraception or intrauterine contraception, is initiated. (II-3) 10. Family planning counselling provides a natural segue into screening for concerns about sexual function or intimate partner violence. (III) 11. Well-informed and well-motivated individuals who have developed skills to practise safer sex behaviours are more likely to use contraceptive and safer sex methods effectively and consistently. (II-2) Recommendations 8. Comprehensive family planning services, including abortion services, should be accessible to all Canadians regardless of geographic location. These services should be confidential, non-judgemental, and respectful of individuals' privacy and cultural contexts. (III-A) 9. A contraceptive visit should include history taking, screening for contraindications, dispensing or prescribing a method of contraception, and exploring contraceptive choice and adherence in the broader context of the individual's sexual behaviour, reproductive health risk, social circumstances, and relevant belief systems. (III-B) 10. Health care providers should provide practical information on the wide range of contraceptive options and their potential non-contraceptive benefits and assist women and their partners in determining the best user-method fit. (III-B) 11. Health care providers should assist women and men in developing the skills necessary to negotiate the use of contraception and the correct and consistent use of a chosen method. (III-B) 12. Contraceptive care should include discussion and management of the risk of sexually transmitted infection, including appropriate recommendations for condom use and dual protection, STI screening, post-exposure prophylaxis, and Hepatitis B and human papillomavirus vaccination. (III-B) 13. Health care providers should emphasize the use of condoms not only for protection against sexually transmitted infection, but also as a back-up method when adherence to a hormonal contraceptive may be suboptimal. (I-A) 14. Health care providers should be aware of current media controversies in reproductive health and acquire relevant evidence-based information that can be briefly and directly communicated to their patients. (III-B) 15. Referral resources for intimate partner violence, sexually transmitted infections, sexual dysfunction, induced abortion services, and child protection services should be available to help clinicians provide contraceptive care in the broader context of women's health. (III-B) Chapter 3: Emergency Contraception Summary Statements 12. The copper intrauterine device is the most effective method of emergency contraception. (II-2) 13. A copper intrauterine device can be used for emergency contraception up to 7 days after unprotected intercourse provided that pregnancy has been ruled out and there are no other contraindications to its insertion. (II-2) 14.  emergency contraception is effective up to 5 days (120 hours) after intercourse; its effectiveness decreases as the time between unprotected intercourse and ingestion increases. (II-2) 15. Ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception is more effective than  emergency contraception up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse. This difference in effectiveness is more pronounced as the time from unprotected intercourse increases, especially after 72 hours. (I) 16. Hormonal emergency contraception ( emergency contraception and ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception) is not effective if taken on the day of ovulation or after ovulation. (II-2) 17.  emergency contraception may be less effective in women with a  mass index > 25 kg/m2 and ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception may be less effective in women with a  mass index > 35 kg/m2. However, hormonal emergency contraception may still retain some effectiveness regardless of a woman's  or  mass index. (II-2) 18. Hormonal emergency contraception is associated with higher failure rates when women continue to have subsequent unprotected intercourse. (II-2) 19. Hormonal contraception can be initiated the day of or the day following the use of  emergency contraception, with back-up contraception used for the first 7 days. (III) 20. Hormonal contraception can be initiated 5 days following the use of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception, with back-up contraception used for the first 14 days. (III) Recommendations 16. All emergency contraception should be initiated as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse. (II-2A) 17. Women should be informed that the copper intrauterine device (IUD) is the most effective method of emergency contraception and can be used by any woman with no contraindications to IUD use.

Almost all synthetic progestogens are devoid of an antimineralocorticoid effect, and are unable to antagonize the salt-retaining effect of estrogens. This property could be one cause of the  gain and increase in blood pressure associated with the use of combined oral contraceptives and, in some susceptible women, with postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This review illustrates the results of clinical studies with drospirenone, a new progestogen with antialdosterone activity. In normally menstruating women, 3 mg drospirenone per day, taken from day 5 to day 25 of the cycle, inhibits ovulation. A combination of 3 mg drospirenone with 30 microg ethinylestradiol (Yasmin, Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) is a highly effective and well-tolerated oral contraceptive, with an overall Pearl Index of 0.57 and an adjusted Pearl Index of 0.09. In addition, this combination leads to mild natriuresis and a slight compensatory activation of the renin-aldosterone system. This effect hasbeen clinically demonstrated: compared with an oral contraceptive containing 30 microg ethinylestradiol and 150 microg , 30 microg ethinylestradiol/3 mg drospirenone, given over 6 months, led to slight decreases in  and blood pressure. For postmenopausal HRT, 2 mg drospirenone was combined with 1 mg 17beta-estradiol (Angeliq, Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) for continuous treatment. To evaluate the endometrial safety of this combination, data were assessed from 520 postmenopausal women receiving 1 mg 17beta-estradiol and drospirenone (1, 2 or 3 mg per day) for at least 100 weeks. There were no cases of hyperplasia or carcinoma during the entire study period, and 85-92% of women had an atrophic/inactive endometrium. Data from two studies, with a treatment duration of at least 6 months, demonstrated a decrease in mean systolic blood pressure of 1.8 mmHg and a decrease in mean diastolic blood pressure of 3.8 mmHg, after treatment with 1 mg 17beta-estradiol/2 mg drospirenonefor 28 weeks. However, in a subgroup of slightly hypertensive women (initial blood pressure of more than 140/90 mmHg), the mean decrease in systolic blood pressure after 28 weeks of treatment with 1 mg 17beta-estradiol/2 mg drospirenone was 12.5 mmHg, and the mean decrease in diastolic blood pressure was 9.4 mmHg. Since high blood pressure is a cardiovascular risk factor, the use of drospirenone may exert a beneficial effect in this regard. More prolonged studies need to be performed, in order to demonstrate whether negative cardiovascular end-points can be reduced by the new progestogen. In conclusion, drospirenone is not only a safe option for women using oral contraceptives or HRT, but it may offer new medical benefits, via its antimineralocorticoid and antialdosterone effects and its potential to decrease water retention and blood pressure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20352560>Contraceptive implants.</a></h2><p>Implantable contraception has been extensively used worldwide. Implants are one of the most effective and reversible methods of contraception available. These devices may be particularly appropriate for certain populations of women, including women who cannot use estrogen-containing contraception. Implants are safe for use by women with many chronic medical problems. The newest implant, Implanon (Organon International, Oss, The Netherlands), is the only device currently available in the United States and was approved in 2006. It is registered for 3 years of pregnancy prevention. Contraceptive implants have failure rates similar to tubal ligation, and yet they are readily reversible with a return to fertility within days of removal. Moreover, these contraceptive devices can be safely placed in the immediate postpartum period, ensuring good contraceptive coverage for women who may be at risk for an unintended pregnancy. Irregular bleeding is a common side effect for all progestin-only contraceptive implants. Preinsertion counseling should address possible side effects, and treatment may be offered to women who experience prolonged or frequent bleeding.Thieme Medical Publishers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28712591>Normalizing Ovulation Rate by Preferential Reduction of Hepato-Visceral Fat in Adolescent Girls With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an increasingly prevalent disorder in adolescent girls, commonly presenting with hirsutism/oligomenorrhea, commonly treated with an oral contraceptive (OC), and commonly followed by oligoanovulatory subfertility. We tested whether an intervention targeting the reduction of hepato-visceral adiposity is followed by a higher ovulation rate than OC treatment.This randomized, open-label, single-center, pilot proof-of-concept study (12 months on treatment, then 12 months off) was performed in adolescent girls with hirsutism and oligomenorrhea (PCOS by National Institutes of Health; no sexual activity; N = 36; mean age 16 years,  mass index 23.5 kg/m; 94% study completion). Compared treatments were OC (ethinylestradiol-) versus low-dose combination of spironolactone 50 mg/d, pioglitazone 7.5 mg/d, and metformin 850 mg/d (SPIOMET). Primary outcome was post-treatment ovulation rate inferred from menstrual diaries and salivary progesterone (12 + 12 weeks). Secondary outcomes included  composition (dual X-ray absorptiometry), abdominal fat (magnetic resonance imaging), insulinemia (oral glucose tolerance test), and androgenemia (liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry).SPIOMET was followed by a 2.5-fold higher ovulation rate than OC (p ≤ .001) and by a 6-fold higher normovulatory fraction (71% vs. 12%; p ≤ .001); oligoanovulation risk after SPIOMET was 65% lower (95% confidence interval, 40%-89%) than after OC. Higher post-treatment ovulation rates related to more on-treatment loss of hepatic fat (r = .27; p < .005). Visceral fat and insulinemia normalized only with SPIOMET; androgenemia normalized faster with OC but rebounded more thereafter. , lean mass, and abdominal subcutaneous fat mass remained stable in both groups.Early SPIOMET treatment for PCOS normalized post-treatment ovulation rates more than OC. Focusing PCOS treatment on early reduction of hepato-visceral fat may prevent part of later oligoanovulatory subfertility.Copyright © 2017 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

The questions aimed at evaluating patient awareness of negative stories and statements, as well as perceived barriers to the copper intrauterine device (IUD) and the -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS).The survey was mailed to 2300 women. A total of 1953 responses were received from Argentina (n = 465), Brazil (n = 380), Colombia (n = 613) and Mexico (n = 495). More women reported having heard negative stories about the copper IUD than about the LNG-IUS. More women believed that the copper IUD, rather than the LNG-IUS, was suitable only for those who had already had children. More women believed that  gain (14.3% vs. 38.2%; p < 0.001), mood swings (14.1% vs. 38.7%; p < 0.001) and infertility (16.3% vs. 19.9%; p = 0.016) were possible side effects of the LNG-IUS. By contrast, more women believed that abortion (36% vs. 22.7%; p < 0.001), pelvic infections (42.1% vs. 15.7%; p < 0.001) and ectopic pregnancy (43.5% vs 23.5%; p < 0.001) were side effects more associated with the copper IUD. More believed the copper IUD was associated with less pain during placement and removal compared with the LNG-IUS (42.8% vs. 31.2%; p < 0.001). The perception of increased risk of contracting a sexual transmitted disease did not differ between the methods (IUD vs. LNG-IUS, 21.7% vs. 20.3%; p = 0.388).Respondents to a web-based survey in four Latin American countries have misperceptions regarding the adverse effects and risks of intrauterine contraception, which may hamper the use of these safe and efficient contraceptive methods. Education about the true risks and benefits involved is fundamental to improving patient acceptance and compliance as well as reducing unplanned pregnancies and unsafe abortions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20664386>Ovarian suppression in normal- and obese women during oral contraceptive use: a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>To assess ovarian suppression during oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use among normal- and obese women using two OCP doses.This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial of two 21-day monophasic OCP formulations (20-microgram ethinyl estradiol [E2],/100-microgram  compared with 30-microgram ethinyl E2/150-microgram ) among normal- ( mass index 19.0-24.9) and obese ( mass index 30.0-39.9) women with regular menses and normal ovarian ultrasonography. Participants underwent transvaginal ultrasonography and phlebotomy twice weekly for 4 weeks during the third or fourth OCP cycle. We assessed OCP compliance using serum  levels. Outcomes included follicular development, endogenous E2 levels, ovulation, and self-reported bleeding patterns.Two hundred twenty-six women enrolled. One hundred eighty-one participants completed the study; we retained 150 consistent OCP users in the main analysis (96 normal , 54 obese). Consistent users of either OCP dose had substantial suppression of follicular development; obesity and follicular development were not related. Among the consistent OCP users, 2.7% ovulated during the study cycle (3 of 96 normal- and 1 of 54 obese participants). Two ovulations occurred with each OCP formulation. Inconsistent OCP use or nonuse during the study cycle was associated with more ovulation (P<.001). Normal- and obese participants had similar follicular development, endogenous estradiol levels, Hoogland scores, and bleeding patterns.Normal- and obese participants who were consistent OCP users experienced substantial and comparable ovarian suppression during OCP use. Higher OCP failure rates among obese women reported elsewhere are thus unlikely to be attributable to physiological differences in OCP effect.ClinicalTrials.gov, www.clinicaltrials.gov; .: I.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20423277>Provision of contraception: a survey among primary care physicians in Finland.</a></h2><p>To investigate self-reported practices of contraceptive provision among primary care physicians.A cross-sectional questionnaire study.All community health centers (n = 63) in an university hospital area in Western Finland.A total of 122 health center physicians involved in contraceptive counseling (CC) were invited to participate in self-administered survey. Data were obtained on initiation of contraceptive methods and the limits and contraindications applied when prescribing combined hormonal contraception (CHC), and they were assessed against Finnish and WHO guidelines.Distribution of initiated contraceptive methods and of examinations and tests included, application of limits and contraindications in relation to age, smoking,  mass index or , blood pressure (BP) and migraine with aura when prescribing CHC (combined oral contraceptives (COCs), vaginal ring and contraceptive patch).Responded physicians (n = 83.68%) said they most frequently prescribed the COC pill. Progestin-only pills, -releasing intrauterine system and copper-releasing intrauterine device were also provided regularly. Most of the respondents routinely took numerous examinations and tests when initiating contraception, including also unnecessary ones. There were gaps in their knowledge about the limits and contraindications for CHC. For example, 41% of the respondents did not recognize migraine with aura as a contraindication and only 19% reported applying the recommended BP limit of 140/90 mmHg.The range of contraceptives available and examinations and tests offered were comprehensive. However, the inadequate procedures regarding assessment of contraindications for CHC suggests that updating CC practices is challenging in primary care.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17525491>[Pathogenetic correction of reproductive function disorder in patients with normogonadotropic ovary deficiency caused by  mass deficiency].</a></h2><p>The aim of the article was the recovery of fertility and realization of reproductive function of women with  mass deficiency (BMD). Thirty seven patients with normogonadotropic ovary deficiency caused by  mass deficiency (12-15% of normal value) underwent pathogenetic treatment, starting from the disorder of hypothalamic-hypophyseal-ovarian system. Pathogenetic therapy was directed to compensate  mass deficit. Hormonal replacement therapy aimed to restore the negative feedback.

This resulted in a tremendous reporting of AEs to pharmacovigilance centres. The aim of this study was to describe the reporting of AEs regarding Mirena in France and to study the impact of media coverage on this reporting.All cases reports involving Mirena recorded in the French national pharmacovigilance database from marketing (21 July 1995) until 04 August 2017 were extracted. To allow studying the influence of mediatisation, reports were described separately for the periods preceding and following the observed media coverage peak (15 May 2017).Overall, 3224 reports were considered, 510 (15.8%) recorded before the media coverage peak, and 2714 (84.2%) after. Before the peak, 76.5% of reports originated from health professionals; median time-to-report was of 5.5 months (interquartile range: 1.7-18.6), and median number of AEs per report was 1 (range: 1-17). After the peak, 98.6% originated from patients; median time-to-report was 21 months (interquartile range: 8.1-45.5), and median number of AEs per report was 6 (range: 1-37). After the peak, most reports mentioned anxio-depressive disorders (38.8 vs 10.6% before) or sexual disorders (47.3 vs 6.9%). Other emphasised AEs were  increase (42.3 vs 10.2%) and pain (gastrointestinal, 19.1 vs 3.5%; musculoskeletal, 22.2 vs 4.5%).This study highlighted the importance of mediatisation impact on spontaneous reporting with changes concerning amounts of reports, type of reporter, and type of reported AEs. For Mirena, this led to generate signals regarding anxio-depressive and sexual disorders.© 2019 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21195957>The  intrauterine system is an effective treatment in selected obese women with abnormal uterine bleeding.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the use of the  intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) in obese premenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB).Prospective observational study (Canadian Task Force Classification II-2).University-affiliated teaching hospital.Fifty-six obese women with  mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m(2).From January 2002 through September 2009, 56 obese patients (BMI >30 kg/m(2)) with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) were identified from the senior author's clinical practice (G.A.V.). After clinical assessment, including Papanicolaou smear, endometrial biopsy, and pelvic sonography, the LNG-IUS was placed to treat their AUB.The median and (range) for age, parity, and BMI were 42.5 years (20-64), 2 children (0-6), and 41.2 kg/m(2) (30-61), respectively. Many patients had additional comorbid conditions placing them at high risk for traditional medical or surgical therapies. The initial endometrial biopsy result was normal in 46 women (82.1%). Three women (5.4%) had inadequate sample, three (5.4%) had simple endometrial hyperplasia, two (3.6%) had complex endometrial hyperplasia without atypia, and two women (3.6%) had complex endometrial hyperplasia with atypia. After placement of the LNG-IUS, all women reported menstrual blood reduction at 3 and 6 months. The LNG-IUS was expelled in 2/56 patients (3.6%) and removed in 12 (21.4%), and a new device was inserted in 3/56 patients (5.4%). At median follow-up of 48 months (range 3-72), the satisfaction rate was 75%.In properly selected obese women with AUB, the LNG-IUS is an effective therapy in approximately 75% of cases.Copyright Â© 2011 AAGL.

In the tumors, binding of estrogens to their receptors was competed neither by progesterone receptor ligands nor by androgen receptor ligands, ruling out direct inhibitory effects of these drugs on tumor development. Progestin binding was competed by the progesterone receptor agonists progesterone and , by the antagonist mifepristone, and also by the androgen dihydrotestosterone, whereas the androgen receptor antagonist hydroxyflutamide was a weak competitor. In addition, both progesterone receptor and androgen receptor ligands competed for binding to androgen receptors. In primary cultures of pituitary tumors,  decreased prolactin secretion, an effect that was blocked by mifepristone but not by hydroxyflutamide. IN VIVO results indicated that  inhibition of both estrogen-induced pituitary  increment and hyperprolactinemia was reduced by mifepristone, whereas flutamide was unable to block  effects. Our results suggest that even when an interaction of  with androgen receptors in the tumors is possible, the antagonistic effects of  on tumor development and functionality are mediated by progesterone receptors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30903201>Involvement of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors in lipid accumulation and depressed G6PD activity in the livers of rats treated with postpartum oral estrogen-progestin.</a></h2><p>Postpartum contraception is an important step for preventing closely spaced pregnancy. Combined oral contraceptive (COC) has been linked to cardiometabolic disturbances. We therefore hypothesized that postpartum oral estrogen-progestin use induces hepatic lipid accumulation that is associated with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation via adenosine deaminase (ADA)/xanthine oxidase (XO)/uric acid (UA)-dependent pathway. Female Wistar rats weighing 130-150 g were mated to achieve timed pregnancy and delivery. Twenty-four (24) dams were randomly assigned to receive vehicle (po), COC (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol and 5.0 μg ; po), COC with GR blockade (mifepristone; 80.0 mg/kg; po) and COC with MR blockade (spironolactone; 0.25 mg/kg; po) daily between 3rd and 11th week postpartum. Data showed that postpartum COC resulted in glucose dysregulation, increased visceral adiposity, liver , plasma corticosterone, aldosterone, circulating and hepatic free fatty acid (FFA), triglyceride (TG), adenosine deaminase (ADA), uric acid production, lactate production, and oxidative marker injury. On the other hand, G6PD-dependent antioxidant defenses were depressed by postpartum COC. However, these effects were attenuated by GR or MR blockade. Our data demonstrate that enhanced G6PD-dependent antioxidant defenses and suppressed ADA/XO/UA pathway in the liver by GR or MR blockade improves glucose dysregulation and hepatic TG accumulation induced by postpartum COC. This study implies a plausible involvement of GR and MR via defective G6PD-dependent antioxidant barrier and increased activity of ADA/XO/UA pathway in postpartum COC-induced hepatic lipid accumulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24709282>[Portal vein thrombosis associated with an acute cytomegalovirus infection].</a></h2><p>Portal vein thrombosis is an unusual condition and its association with an acute cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is known but rarely reported. We present here the case of a 24-year-old woman suffering from a symptomatic portal vein thrombosis, confirmed by CT angiography, and acute CMV-related hepatitis. Besides a second generation oral contraceptive with estrogen and progesterone, not associated with smoking, the acute CMV infection was the only cause found to have provoked the venous thrombosis; a myeloproliferative disorder or biological thrombophilia were ruled out. The patient rapidly recovered with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) anticoagulant treatment. Eighteen cases of splanchnic vein thrombosis complicating acute CMV infection were found in the literature. All patients had acute hepatitis. The outcome was usually favorable with warfarin therapy for a period lasting 3 to 7 months. Antiviral treatment (anti-CMV) was used in three cases of severe infection. The antiviral therapy was given only in immunosuppressed patients. For immunocompetent patients, CMV infection is usually asymptomatic and clinical signs are often non-specific and mild, not requiring treatment.This case report and the review of the literature recall the need to search for acute CMV infection in patients with portal thrombosis so a possible transient trigger for venous thromboembolism can be identified, avoiding extended anticoagulation.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Up to 90% of EC patients are obese which poses a health threat to patients post-treatment. Standard treatment for EC includes hysterectomy, although this has significant side effects for obese women at high risk of surgical complications and for women of childbearing age. This trial investigates the effectiveness of non-surgical or conservative treatment options for obese women with early stage EC. The primary aim is to determine the efficacy of:  intrauterine device (LNG-IUD); with or without metformin (an antidiabetic drug); and with or without a  loss intervention to achieve a pathological complete response (pCR) in EC at six months from study treatment initiation. The secondary aim is to enhance understanding of the molecular processes and to predict a treatment response by investigating EC biomarkers.An open label, three-armed, randomised, phase-II, multi-centre trial of LNG-IUD ± metformin ±  loss intervention. 165 participants from 28 centres are randomly assigned in a 3:3:5 ratio to the treatment arms. Clinical, quality of life and health behavioural data will be collected at baseline, six weeks, three and six months. EC biomarkers will be assessed at baseline, three and six months.There is limited prospective evidence for conservative treatment for EC. Trial results could benefit patients and reduce health system costs through a reduction in hospitalisations and through lower incidence of adverse events currently observed with standard treatment.Crown Copyright © 2014.

Effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be related to metabolic changes in obesity or to greater  mass or  fat. Hormonal contraceptives include oral contraceptives (OCs), injectables, implants, hormonal intrauterine contraception (IUC), the transdermal patch, and the vaginal ring. Given the prevalence of overweight and obesity, the public health impact of any effect on contraceptive efficacy could be substantial.To examine the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives in preventing pregnancy among women who are overweight or obese versus women with a lower  mass index (BMI) or .Until 4 August 2016, we searched for studies in PubMed (MEDLINE), CENTRAL, POPLINE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. We examined reference lists of pertinent articles to identify other studies. For the initial review, we wrote to investigators to find additional published or unpublished studies.All study designs were eligible. The study could have examined any type of hormonal contraceptive. Reports had to contain information on the specific contraceptive methods used. The primary outcome was pregnancy. Overweight or obese women must have been identified by an analysis cutoff for  or BMI (kg/m(2)).Two authors independently extracted the data. One entered the data into RevMan and a second verified accuracy. The main comparisons were between overweight or obese women and women of lower  or BMI. We examined the quality of evidence using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Where available, we included life-table rates. We also used unadjusted pregnancy rates, relative risk (RR), or rate ratio when those were the only results provided. For dichotomous variables, we computed an odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI).With 8 studies added in this update, 17 met our inclusion criteria and had a total of 63,813 women. We focus here on 12 studies that provided high, moderate, or low quality evidence. Most did not show a higher pregnancy risk among overweight or obese women. Of five COC studies, two found BMI to be associated with pregnancy but in different directions. With an OC containing norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol (EE), pregnancy risk was higher for overweight women, i.e. with BMI ≥ 25 versus those with BMI < 25 (reported relative risk 2.49, 95% CI 1.01 to 6.13). In contrast, a trial using an OC with  and EE reported a Pearl Index of 0 for obese women (BMI ≥ 30) versus 5.59 for nonobese women (BMI < 30). The same trial tested a transdermal patch containing  and EE. Within the patch group, obese women in the "treatment-compliant" subgroup had a higher reported Pearl Index than nonobese women (4.63 versus 2.15). Of five implant studies, two that examined the six-capsule  implant showed differences in pregnancy by . One study showed higher  was associated with higher pregnancy rate in years 6 and 7 combined (reported P < 0.05). In the other, pregnancy rates differed in year 5 among the lower  groups only (reported P < 0.01) and did not involve women weighing 70 kg or more.Analysis of data from other contraceptive methods indicated no association of pregnancy with overweight or obesity. These included depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (subcutaneous),  IUC, the two-rod  implant, and the etonogestrel implant.The evidence generally did not indicate an association between higher BMI or  and effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. However, we found few studies for most contraceptive methods. Studies using BMI, rather than  alone, can provide information about whether  composition is related to contraceptive effectiveness. The contraceptive methods examined here are among the most effective when used according to the recommended regimen.We considered the overall quality of evidence to be low for the objectives of this review. More recent reports provided evidence of varying quality, while the quality was generally low for older studies. For many trials the quality would be higher for their original purpose rather than the non-randomized comparisons here. Investigators should consider adjusting for potential confounding related to BMI or contraceptive effectiveness. Newer studies included a greater proportion of overweight or obese women, which helps in examining effectiveness and side effects of hormonal contraceptives within those groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17717130>Development of a novel immunoassay for the assessment of plasma Gas6 concentrations and their variation with hormonal status.</a></h2><p>Gas6 is a vitamin K-dependent antiapoptotic protein that has been implicated in cardiovascular pathophysiology.

Forty-five of the women then received an oral contraceptive, which contained ethinylestradiol and , for 3 months before a new measurement was performed at the same time point in their menstrual cycles.Interassay imprecision was 5.8%-11.8%, and the detection limit was 5.9 microg/L. Mean Gas6 plasma concentrations were significantly lower in men (52.0 microg/L) than in women not receiving oral contraceptives (63.8 microg/L, P <0.001). In the women who received oral contraceptives, Gas6 concentrations decreased after 3 months of therapy from 63.6 microg/L to 51.9 microg/L (P <0.001).We have developed a simple and reproducible ELISA assay for measuring plasma Gas6 concentrations, which vary with sex and are decreased by oral contraceptive use.

We counseled all women delivered and planning birth-space and breastfeed for at least 1 year for participation during postpartum hospital stay. Eligible participants for inclusion in the randomized controlled trial () were allocated to receive adequate Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM) counseling (LAM-only group) or the LAM counseling in addition to counseling about LNG-ECPs use (LAM + emergency contraception (EC) group). These pills were to be used once if unprotected intercourse did occur after expiry of any of the LAM prerequisites and before the couples started to use a reliable method of contraception. We included the first 100 women in the LAM + EC who did use the pills and the first 100 women in the control group who completed the follow-up visits for 6 months to draw the infants' outcome.

Investigators evaluated adverse events during cycles 2, 4, 6, 9, and 13. Participants recorded drug administration and uterine bleeding on daily diary cards. Compliance was assessed by measuring  and ethinyl estradiol plasma levels. Pearl Index (pregnancies per 100 woman-years) was calculated to evaluate efficacy.Participants (N=1,504) were randomized to Patch (n=1,129) or Pill (n=375). Approximately 30% were obese, more than 40% were racial or ethnic minorities, and more than 55% were new users of hormonal contraceptives. Laboratory-verified noncompliance (undetectable plasma drug levels) was 11% of Patch and 12.6% of Pill users at cycle 6. Pearl Indices (95% confidence intervals) for the intention-to-treat population (cycles 1-6) were 4.45 (2.34-6.57) for Patch and 4.02 (0.50-7.53) for Pill; excluding laboratory-verified noncompliant participants, Pearl Indices were 2.82 (0.98-4.67) for Patch and 3.80 (0.08-7.52) for Pill (differences not statistically significant). Incidence of unscheduled bleeding and incidence and severity of adverse events were similar for both contraceptives (no statistically significant difference).Efficacy and safety of the new contraceptive Patch are comparable to those of a Pill.

Participants had scheduled follow-up visits four times during the first year. After year 1, study visits occurred every 6 months, with phone contact at the 3-month point between visits. We assessed the primary outcome of pregnancy rate (Pearl Index) in females aged 16-35 years at enrollment through 60 months. The safety evaluation included all females for their entire duration of participation.The 1,751 enrollees included 1,600 females aged 16-35 years and 151 aged 36-45 years. Successful IUS placement occurred in 1,714 (97.9%) participants. At the time of the data evaluation, 495 participants finished 5 years and 176 had entered the seventh year of IUS use.

Twenty women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) who agreed to treatment with the LNG-IUS and had a  mass index (BMI) of >30 kg/m were recruited between May and December 2014. The women completed two validated tools (Menstrual Impact Questionnaire and the Pictorial Bleeding Assessment Chart) at recruitment, 6 and 12 months follow-up. Demographic, medical and laboratory variables were obtained from the relevant CMH databases.

Based on lack of change in intermediate markers, as well as results of epidemiologic studies, low-dose OCs do not increase the risk of diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Obesity is a risk factor for impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes and coronary artery disease, and most previous OC studies excluded these women; thus, we have limited information about carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in obese OC users.This study compared changes in carbohydrate and lipid parameters in 71 normal- and 38 obese women initiating the OC. Women were randomized to two pills: 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE)/150 mcg  (LNG) or 20 mcg EE/100 mcg LNG. Participants underwent baseline and cycle-3 measurements of fasting serum glucose; insulin; triglycerides and total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.Normal- and obese participants experienced similar changes in mean glucose, insulin and log homeostatic model assessment, as well as similar changes in total cholesterol, HDL and triglycerides; however, change in mean LDL (-4.9±20.6 mg/dL vs. +3.8±17.3 mg/dL) was different between the obese and normal- groups, respectively. Among the obese participants, change in glucose was marginally greater with the higher dose pill (p=.06); otherwise, changes between the  mass index groups were not modified by pill dose.Obesity had little effect on any OC-induced changes in carbohydrate or lipid metabolism except for a borderline adverse interaction between obesity and OC dose with respect to fasting glucose and a positive interaction between obesity and OC use with respect to LDL cholesterol.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Proliferation of normal breast epithelium is most extensive during the natural luteal phase. To determine the impact of one cycle of a combined oral contraceptive (COC) on breast homeostasis, we evaluated the proliferation index (PI), determined by KI-67 expression, in normal human mammary epithelial cells and correlated it with cellular proliferation in spontaneous menstrual cycles during the same period. Normal breast tissue samples were obtained from 82 patients randomized in two groups. Forty-two women in group A received one cycle of a COC (30 mug ethinyl estradiol and 150 mug ) administrated daily for 21 days, beginning on the first day of the menstrual cycle. Group B patients (n = 40) experienced a natural menstrual cycle. Menstrual cycle phase characterization was based on the date of the last period and subsequent menses and on progesterone serum levels obtained at the time of biopsy. The PI (number of Ki-67-positive nuclei per 1,000 epithelial cells), was significantly larger in group A (5.47 +/- 3.87), than in group B (3.27 +/- 3.24), p < 0.01. A cyclical variation of PI was observed in COC cycles. The rise in PI in the first week of the COC cycles was significantly higher than in the natural cycle (COC = 7.02 +/- 4.94; non-COC = 1.10 +/- 0.67; p < 0.0011). There was no significant difference between the two groups during the other weeks. Additionally, there was an inverse correlation between proliferation and chronological age, irrespective of the stage of the cycle. The PI of COC (p = 0.175) and natural cycles (p = 0.466) were not statistically different in younger patients. COC users have increased proliferative activity at the beginning of the menstrual cycle. This alteration in the pattern of proliferative activity may relate to the increased risk of breast cancer that has been associated with COCs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22563024>Long-term regression of experimental endometriosis in a rat model treated with local application of -loaded biodegradable microspheres.</a></h2><p>A previous study demonstrated that local application of -loaded polylactic acid microspheres (LNG microspheres) resulted in significant regression of endometriotic cysts in a rabbit model for 6 months without disturbing the metabolic parameters or ovarian function. In order to investigate the feasibility of local application of LNG microspheres as a long-term maintenance treatment for endometriosis, the suppressive effect of a single intra-cystic injection of LNG microspheres was studied for 1 year in a rat model.Twenty four rats with experimental endometriotic cysts were randomized to be treated with a single intra-cystic injection of LNG microspheres (n = 8); 6-month GnRH agonist (GnRHa, n = 8) or control (n = 8). Intra-cystic injection of LNG microspheres and GnRHa treatment caused comparable regression and atrophy in endometriotic cysts in the first 6 months. Compared with the control, the wet  of the endometriotic cysts was significantly lower in both groups at Month 6 but by Month 12 only remained low in the LNG microspheres group (P < 0.01). The immunostaining of estrogen receptors (ERs) in both the epithelium and stroma and progesterone receptors (PRs) in the stroma was significantly weakened in the LNG microspheres group at Month 6 and was not fully restored at Month 12 (P < 0.01). Metabolic parameters and estrous cycle were not disturbed by local application of LNG microspheres.In a rat endometriosis model, the suppressive effect of a single intra-cystic injection of LNG microspheres was comparable to that of GnRHa, and was maintained for 1 year.

The different pharmacological composition of EPs is responsible for different clinical effects. One of the most used low-dose EP associations is ethinylestradiol 20 mcg plus  100 mcg in monophasic regimen (EE20/LNG100). This review summarizes clinical pharmacology, cycle control, and effects on lipid and glucose metabolism, coagulation, / composition, acne, and sexuality of EE20/LNG100. Overall, EE20/LNG100 combination is safe and well tolerated, and in several studies the incidence of adverse events in the treated group was comparable to that of the placebo group. Cycle control was effective and / composition did not vary among treated and untreated groups in most studies. The EE20/LNG100 combination shows mild or no effect on lipid and glucose metabolism. Lastly, EE20/LNG100 is associated with a low risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Many procedures such as IUD insertion are more challenging in overweight and obese women. The objective of this study was to describe LNG-IUD insertion, continuation, and complications in overweight and obese women in an ethnically diverse population in Hawai'i. A retrospective cohort study of women who had a LNG-IUD inserted at the University of Hawai'i, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Resident and Faculty practice sites between January 2009 and December 2010 was performed. A total of 149 women were followed. The most commonly reported races were Asian (32%), Native Hawaiian (26%), and non-Hawaiian Pacific Islander (20%). The mean BMI of the study population was 28.4 (standard deviation 7.2) with 37% classified as normal , 30% as overweight, and 33% as obese. Overall, 76% of women continued the LNG-IUD 12 months after insertion. No statistically significant difference emerged in 12-month IUD continuation between the BMI groups. Difficult (5%) and failed (3%) IUD insertions were rare for all BMI groups. IUD complications occurred in 9% of women and included expulsion and self-removal.

The symptoms were measured using the Women's Health Assessment Questionnaire. Subjects receiving DRSP/EE had fewer prevalence of premenstrual symptoms than those receiving LNG/EE after six cycles. A significantly lower score of negative affect category in the premenstrual phase was demonstrated in those receiving DRSP/EE more than LNG/EE. The DRSP/EE group showed a greater improvement of mean scores from baseline in the premenstrual phase compared with those who received LNG/EE on negative affect as seen in the items on anxiety, irritability, feeling sad or blue and  gain in the category of water retention. In conclusion, OCs containing DRSP have beneficial effects in reducing the prevalence of premenstrual symptoms especially the symptoms of negative affect and  gain, particularly when compared to LNG/EE.

The aim of this study was to evaluate  and BC in LNG-IUS users compared to users of the TCu380A intrauterine device (IUD).A prospective study was done with 76 new users of both contraceptive methods. Women were paired by age (±2 years) and  mass index (BMI, kg/m², ±2).  and BC (% lean mass and % fat mass) were evaluated by a trained professional at baseline and at 1 year of contraceptive use. The BC measurements were obtained using Lunar DXA equipment.  and BC were evaluated in each woman at baseline and at 12 months and analyzed as the mean change within each woman. Then, the changes in  and BC for each woman were calculated and then compared between LNG-IUS and TCu380A IUD users (paired data for each woman). The central-to-peripheral fat ratio was calculated by dividing trunk fat by the upper and lower limb fat.There were no significant differences at time of IUD insertion between LNG-IUS and TCu380A IUD users regarding age (mean±SD) (34.4±7.5 vs. 33.9±8.0 years), BMI (25.3±4.1 vs. 25.9±4.1) and number of pregnancies (1.9±0.2 vs. 1.7±0.2), respectively. Mean  gain of 2.9 kg was observed among LNG-IUS users at 12 months (p=.0012), whereas the  of TCu380A IUD users only increased by 1.4 kg (p=.067). There was no significant difference in  change between the two groups of users at 12 months. The variation in the central-to-peripheral fat ratio was the same between the two groups (-1.6% vs. -0.2%; p=.364). LNG-IUS users showed a 2.5% gain in fat mass (p=.0009) and a 1.4% loss of lean mass, whereas TCu380A IUD users showed a loss of 1.3% of fat mass (p=.159) and gain of 1.0% of lean mass (p=.120). TCu380A IUD users gained more lean mass than LNG-IUS users (p=.0270), although there was no significant difference between the two groups after 12 months of use.Although an increase in mean fat mass among LNG-IUS users at 12 months of use was observed, it should be noted that an increase of  was also observed in both groups after 1 year of insertion of the device.

From December, 2006 to December, 2014, patients of symptomatic adenomyosis diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound in Peking Union Medical College Hospital were given LNG-IUS. Before and after placement of IUS, all patients' parameters were recorded, including carrying status of IUS, symptoms and scores of dysmenorrhea, menstruation scores, biochemical indicators, physical parameters, menstruation patterns and adverse effects. Risk factors for changes of menstruation patterns and adverse effects, and their impact on treatment effects were analyzed.  Totally 1 100 cases met inclusion criteria, with median age 36 years(range 20-44 years), median follow-up 35 months(range 1 -108 months). During follow-up changes of menstruation patterns increased significantly with amenorrhea and shortened-menstruation being the most common manifestations.

During Cycles 2, 3 and 4, outpatient visits were performed to assess maximum serum concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC0-∞) and time to steady state as well as pharmacodynamics. These key PK parameters were calculated and compared within groups between baseline and treatment cycles.A total of 31 women enrolled and completed the study (CC group, n=16; ID group, n=15). Demographics were similar between groups [mean BMI: CC, 38 kg/m(2) (S.D. 5.1); ID, 41 kg/m(2) (S.D. 7.6)]. At baseline, the key LNG PK parameters were no different between groups; average time to reach steady state was 12 days in both groups; Cmax were CC: 3.82±1.28 ng/mL and ID: 3.13±0.87 ng/mL; and AUC0-∞ were CC: 267±115 h ng/mL and ID: 199±75 h ng/mL. Following randomization, the CC group maintained steady-state serum levels whereas the ID group had a significantly higher Cmax (p<.001) but again required 12 days to achieve steady state. However, AUC was not significantly different between CC (412±255 h ng/mL) and ID (283±130 h ng/mL). Forty-five percent (14/31) of the study population had evidence of an active follicle-like structure prior to randomization and afterwards this decreased to 9% (3/31).Both increasing the OC dose and continuous dosing appear to counteract the impact of obesity on key OC PK parameters.Obesity adversely affects the pharmacokinetics of very low dose OC pills.

We randomly assigned participants to receive either immediate (within 5 days of delivery) or delayed (6 to 8 weeks postpartum) insertion of a two-rod  contraceptive implant system. This is a prespecified secondary analysis evaluating breastfeeding outcomes. The primary outcome of this secondary analysis was change in infant ; infants were weighed and measured at birth and 6 months. We used a validated questionnaire to assess onset of lactogenesis daily in person while participants were in the hospital, and then daily by phone after they left the hospital, until lactogenesis was documented. We used interviewer-administered questionnaires to assess breastfeeding continuation and concerns at 3 months and 6 months postpartum.Among the 96 women randomized to the immediate group and the 87 women to the delayed group, the mean change in infant  from birth to 6 months was similar between groups: 4632 g in the immediate group and 4407 g in the delayed group (p=.26). Among the 97 women who had not experienced lactogenesis prior to randomization, the median time to onset of lactogenesis did not differ significantly between the immediate and delayed groups (65 h versus 63 h; p=.84). Similar proportions of women in the immediate and delayed groups reported exclusive breastfeeding at 3 months (74% versus 71%; p=.74) and 6 months (48% versus 52%; p=.58).We found no association between the timing of postpartum initiation of  contraceptive implants and change in infant growth from birth to 6 months, onset of lactogenesis, or breastfeeding continuation at 3 or 6 months postpartum.This study provides evidence that immediate postpartum initiation of contraception implants does not have a deleterious effect on infant growth or initiation or continuation of breastfeeding.Copyright © 2018.

Seventy-five adolescents had DD; 33 underwent intrauterine system insertion in the operating room and 42 did not. A comparative cohort of 148 ND adolescents who had pelvic ultrasound examinations for abnormal uterine bleeding were included. The study period was between January 2006 and July 2013 at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. Cases were identified from surgical databases and medical records.Mean uterine length on pelvic ultrasound, demographic characteristics (age, age at menarche, time from menarche to ultrasound, ), and descriptive statistics on intrauterine system insertion.There was a statistically significant difference (P = .03) in uterine length between adolescents with and without DD (6.7 vs 7.1 cm). However, this was not a clinically significant difference because insertion of the LNG-IUS in patients with DD was successful in patients with uteri more than 5 cm long. There was no difference (P = .97) in uterine length of adolescents with DD whether they had LNG-IUS insertion or not (6.7 cm). Adolescents with DD were younger than adolescents without DD at time of ultrasound examination (P = .01). However, among patients with DD, those who underwent intrauterine system insertion were older (P = .001). Incidence of uterine anomaly in patients with DD is low (2.7%) and was the same as in ND adolescents. Rates of complications and expulsions were low and there were no failures of LNG-IUS insertion in adolescents with DD.Routine pelvic ultrasound examinations are not necessary before insertion of the LNG-IUS for menstrual suppression in adolescents with DD.

Tailor treatment to the individual patient.</a></h2><p>Uterine leiomyomas are benign, often asymptomatic, tumours of the uterus. When they are symptomatic, the most frequent symptom is heavy, prolonged menstrual bleeding, which stops at menopause. When this blood loss causes iron-deficiency anaemia, iron supplementation is justified. Various treatments aimed at reducing uterine blood loss are proposed for women with leiomyoma-related bleeding. As of late 2013, what is the harm-benefit balance of these treatments? To answer this question, we reviewed the available data using the standard Prescrire methodology. Hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) is the most radical treatment for the clinical manifestations of uterine leiomyomas. Serious complications sometimes occur. Nine randomised trials including a total of 1553 patients found no advantage in leaving the cervix intact. Randomised trials in about 4500 patients showed that the vaginal approach is preferable to an open abdominal or laparoscopic approach: in particular, it resulted in fewer infections and less bleeding. Myomectomy (selective removal of uterine leiomyomas) is another surgical option, especially when the patient wishes to preserve her fertility. Its evaluation is mainly based on noncomparative case series. As with hysterectomy, it exposes patients to the risk of serious complications. Symptoms recur in 4% to 27% of cases.The reintervention rate is 4% to 20%. Injections of the gonadorelin agonists leuprorelin or triptorelin reduce bleeding associated with leiomyomas, according to several randomised trials. They have not been demonstrated to reduce the need for transfusion or to facilitate subsequent surgery for leiomyomas.The harm-benefit balance of prolonged use of these drugs is unfavourable, due to their numerous adverse effects. The oral progesterone receptor antagonist ulipristal reduces excessive bleeding, but has not been demonstrated to facilitate subsequent surgery.The effects on the endometrium of taking ulipristal for more than 3 months are unknown. The progesterone antagonist mifepristone reduced bleeding in small randomised trials, but increased the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia. The -releasing intrauterine device has mainly been evaluated in non-comparative studies, which suggest that it reduces menstrual bleeding in women with leiomyomas. The risk of expulsion of the device in women with leiomyomas appears to be about 20%. Its main adverse effects are rare cases of acne, depression, headache,  gain and breast tenderness. Very little evaluation data is available on oral progestins in this situation. A progestin, such as norethisterone, taken from the 5th to the 26th day of the menstrual cycle seems to reduce menstrual blood loss and has a contraceptive effect. Oral progestins expose women to an increased risk of venous thromboembolism and possibly increase the risk of breast cancer. Their harm-benefit balance seems less favourable than that of the -releasing intrauterine device. The thrombotic risk associated with tranexamic acid is unclear, but deserves serious consideration given the drug's uncertain efficacy. In practice, the treatment should be chosen with the patient, based on various factors, including severity of symptoms, age, desire to preserve fertility or the uterus, characteristics of the leiomyomas, and patient preference. As of late 2013, when drug treatment is considered useful in postponing surgery or while awaiting menopause, the -releasing intrauterine device is the first choice. Oral progestins are another alternative, although their adverse effects are unclear when taken for several months. It is better to avoid exposing patients to the other available drugs, and to choose iron supplementation for women who develop anaemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28041992>Changes in  composition in women using long-acting reversible contraception.</a></h2><p>Users of hormonal long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) report  gain as a side effect, but few studies have assessed  composition change among LARC users.

The mean age was 25.9 years, 56.4% were White, 82.5% had some college education and 67.6% were nulliparous. Although lean  mass increased over 12 months in LNG-IUS and copper IUD users but not in ENG implant users, changes in  and  composition did not differ between the groups. In the adjusted model, Black race was associated with change in total  mass (p<.05).Among those who continued the method for 12 months, changes in  and composition did not differ between copper IUD, LNG-IUS and ENG implant users.Changes in  and composition over 12 months did not differ between copper IUD users and LNG-IUS and ENG implant users among those with 12 months of continuous use.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It decreases the blood loss due to haemostatic effect of estrogen and also regularizes the cycle. Intravaginal route has been found to be effective and acceptable; Gastrointestinal absorption and hepatic first-pass metabolism is avoided and steady, uniform blood concentration is achieved. Bioavailability of estrogen and progestogen through oral and vaginal route are same. The convenience of once-a-month administration is another major advantage.Sixty women fulfilling inclusion criteria were randomised into 2 groups in 1:1 ratio. In one group (n=30), monthly insertion of Nuvaring(®)) was done for three consecutive months. Nuvaring(®) releases 15μg ethinyl estradiol and 120 μg etonogesterol daily. The other group (n=30) received COC pill containing 30μg EE and 150 μg  for three consecutive months. Primary outcome  were change in menstrual cycle pattern and pictorial Blood Loss Assessment chart (PBAC) score. Other Parameters included side effects, change in haemoglobin and . Data was analyzed by statistical software SPSS 20.Both Nuvaring(®) and COC were found to significantly decrease blood loss in each cycle. Decrease in PBAC score was more in Nuvaring(®) group compared to COC, however difference was not significant. Ideal bleed (IB) was frequently higher for Nuvaring(®) group than COC in all 3 cycles, although no statistically significant difference was observed between groups (p-value=0.286). Late withdrawl, intermenstural spotting was higher in COC group. Compliance was better and women were more satisfied in Nuvaring(®) group compared to COC group. Minor side effects like headache, mastalgia, nausea and mood changes were seen in both groups, which were not significant. Continuation rate was significantly higher in Nuvaring® group. 30% women discontinued treatment in OCP group after 3 month compare to 10% in Nuvaring(®) group.Present study shows Nuvaring(®) to be as effective as COC in controlling heavy menstural bleed, better cycle control, with minor acceptable systemic side effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20682146>Contraceptive use among women with a history of bariatric surgery: a systematic review.</a></h2><p> loss after bariatric surgery often improves fertility but can pose substantial risks to maternal and fetal outcomes. Women who have undergone a bariatric surgical procedure are currently advised to delay conception for up to 2 years.We conducted a systematic review of the literature, from database (PubMed) inception through February 2009, to evaluate evidence on the safety and effectiveness of contraceptive use among women with a history of bariatric surgery.From 29 articles, five met review inclusion criteria. One prospective, noncomparative study reported 2 pregnancies among 9 (22%) oral contraceptive (OC) users following biliopancreatic diversion, and one descriptive study reported no pregnancies among an unidentified number of women taking OCs following laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Of two pharmacokinetic studies, one found lower plasma levels of norethisterone and  among women having had a jejunoileal bypass, as compared to nonoperated, normal- controls. The other study found no difference in plasma levels of D-norgestrel between women having a jejunoileal bypass of either 1:3 or 3:1 ratio between the length of jejunum and ileum left in continuity, but women with a 1:3 ratio had significantly higher plasma levels of D-norgestrel than extremely obese controls not operated upon.Evidence regarding OC effectiveness following a bariatric surgical procedure is quite limited, although no substantial decrease in effectiveness was identified from available studies. Evidence on failure rates for other contraceptive methods and evidence on safety for all contraceptive methods was not identified.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21126966>Combined oral contraceptives and : do oral contraceptives cause  gain?

Monkeys were monitored for changes in , levels of physical activity (measured by a triaxial Actical accelerometer), food/caloric intake, percent  fat (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, DEXA) and metabolism (24 h metabolic rate and serum metabolic substrate and hormone concentrations).All 10 monkeys completed the study protocol with no adverse events. While  (-0.73% change) and percent  fat (-1.78% change) of the normal BMI group did not significantly decrease from baseline, obese monkeys showed a significant decrease in  (-8.58% change, P < 0.01) and percent  fat (-12.13% change P = 0.02) with OC treatment. In both the obese (P = 0.03) and the normal BMI (P = 0.01) groups, there was a significant increase in basal metabolic rate with OC use. No changes were seen in food intake, activity level or % lean muscle mass with OC use for either BMI-based group.Overall, OC use appears to cause a slight increase in basal metabolic rate in female monkeys, leading to a decrease in  and percent  fat in obese individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27217053>The safety of Sino-implant (II) for women with medical conditions or other characteristics: a systematic review.</a></h2><p>This study aims to systematically review evidence published on the safety of Sino-implant (II) [SI (II)] among women with medical conditions or characteristics identified by the World Health Organization for eligibility for contraceptive use.We searched PubMed, WEIPU, CNKI and Wanfang to identify all relevant evidence published in peer-reviewed journals from 1991 through 2014 regarding the safety of SI (II). We considered studies among women with medical conditions or other characteristics, such as age and parity, as direct evidence and studies among healthy women or a general population of women as indirect evidence.We identified 108 articles of which 9 met our inclusion criteria. Among women with medical conditions, no evidence was identified for the outcomes of interest, including serious adverse events or outcomes related to medical conditions. Among healthy women, evidence regarding efficacy of SI (II) for women weighing ≥70 kg was conflicting; one study showed an increased pregnancy rate and another showed no relationship. Women with menorrhagia did not experience worsened symptoms and may benefit from SI (II) use. Healthy women using SI (II) were no more likely than users of other methods to gain , develop elevated blood pressure, have abnormal liver or bone density tests or develop ovarian cysts or uterine myomas.Evidence among healthy women suggests SI (II) is safe and had health outcomes similar to those of other  implants. Studies were limited and conflicting regarding efficacy for women ≥70 kg. All included studies were conducted in China, limiting generalizability.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Progestogen administered by a device with a 5-year lifespan, has been shown to be an effective medical alternative with several advantages. The aims of this study were to investigate its efficacy, continuation rates and side-effects in women with endometriosis over a 3-year period.Thirty-four women with laparoscopically confirmed minimal to moderate symptomatic endometriosis offered insertion of an intrauterine device at diagnostic laparoscopy were followed up at 1, 3 and 6 months, and then every 6 months for 3 years. A symptom diary for side-effects, documentation of symptoms on a visual analogue scale (VAS), a verbal rating scale (VRS) and quantified menstrual loss using the pictorial blood loss chart was used to assess response to treatment.The continuation rates were respectively 85%, 68%, 62% and 56% at, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. Discontinuation rates were highest at <12 months, and most of these were for irregular and intolerable bleeding and persistent pain. An improvement in symptoms was observed throughout the 36 months. The greatest changes in pain assessed by either the VAS or VRS were between the pretreatment scores and those after 12 months (7.7 +/- 1.3 versus 3.5 +/- 1.8 for VAS, P < 0.001; and 25 +/- 13.8 versus 14 +/- 9.4 for VRS, P < 0.002). The monthly quantified blood loss fell from 204 (196) pretreatment to 60 (50) at 12 months (P < 0.001) and then to 70 (30) after 36 months. The most common side-effects were bleeding irregularities (14.7%), one-sided abdominal pain (11.8%) and  gain (8.8%).Intrauterine progestogen is effective in symptom control throughout the 3 years on the device, and discontinuation is greatest between 3 and 6 months.

Blood samples were collected at pre-insertion, 12, 24 and 36 months follow up for packed cell volume, platelet count, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. Statistical analysis was with paired t-test. The level of significance was set at p<0.05. Each acceptor received a menstrual calendar to chart all bleeding events.The mean age and  of the 29 acceptors who had complete records at 36 months of study were 33.7 +/- 5.9 years, 64.1 +/- 9.9 kg respectively. The mean packed cell volume (PCV) was 34.3 +/- 2.5% at pre-insertion. This rose to significant mean +/- SD values of 37.6 +/- 3.5%; p < 0.0002, 37.4 +/- 3.2%: p < 0.0001 and 38.0 +/- 2.6%; p < 0.0001 at 12, 24 and 36 months respectively. The mean platelet count at pre-insertion was (239,724 +/- 85,886 per microl).

The prevalence of the MS is rising worldwide, and is linked to two diagnoses in young women: polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).This narrative review focuses on hormonal contraceptive choices available for women in Europe with features of the MS.The -intrauterine system and progestogen-only pills containing desogestrel or  have no significant effects on MS parameters. Combined oestrogen-progestogen methods do not appear to increase waist circumference or the incidence of glucose intolerance in women with PCOS or a history of GDM; their effect on HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides is comparable with that observed in women without the MS, while the effect on blood pressure remains inconclusive. The etonogestrel implant does not affect , triglycerides and blood pressure but mildly reduces insulin sensitivity and HDL-cholesterol in healthy women. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate increases  and truncal fat deposition, and lowers glucose tolerance in women with previous GDM.Low-dose hormonal contraception is safe for many women with the MS, but high-dose progestogens must be avoided.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22490745>[Effects of  intrauterine system on endometrial tissue after endometrial polyps resection by hysteroscopy].</a></h2><p>To explore the changes of endometrial tissues after the insertion of  intrauterine system (LNG-IUS).The endometrial tissues were harvested from 21 cases after endometrial polyps resection by hysteroscopy.

Perforation of the uterus by an LNG-IUS leading to small bowel obstruction (SBO) has not been reported in the literature.A 29-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, and vomiting. CT scan revealed dilated loops of small bowel suggestive of SBO and an IUD that did not appear within the uterine cavity. Laparoscopy revealed a dense adhesive band of tissue extending from 2 cm caudad to the umbilical port site to 1 arm of the perforated LNG-IUS at the posterior uterine wall. Two bowel loops were twisted around the adhesive band multiple times. The band was taken down at the IUD and the bowel loops were spontaneously freed. The LNG-IUS was removed.Use of the LNG-IUS is on the rise in the United States and is a recommended first-line contraceptive agent in the obese patient. Management of perforated IUD in an obese patient should take into account individual patient characteristics. Laparoscopic management of a SBO due to a perforated IUD in an obese patient is possible.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25793657>Combined hormonal versus nonhormonal versus progestin-only contraception in lactation.</a></h2><p>Postpartum contraception improves the health of mothers and children by lengthening birth intervals. For lactating women, contraception choices are limited by concerns about hormonal effects on milk quality and quantity and passage of hormones to the infant. Ideally, the contraceptive chosen should not interfere with lactation or infant growth. Timing of contraception initiation is also important. Immediately postpartum, most women have contact with a health professional, but many do not return for follow-up contraceptive counseling. However, immediate initiation of hormonal methods may disrupt the onset of milk production.To determine the effects of hormonal contraceptives on lactation and infant growthWe searched for eligible trials until 2 March 2015. Sources included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, POPLINE, Web of Science, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. We also examined review articles and contacted investigators.We sought randomized controlled trials in any language that compared hormonal contraception versus another form of hormonal contraception, nonhormonal contraception, or placebo during lactation. Hormonal contraception includes combined or progestin-only oral contraceptives, injectable contraceptives, implants, and intrauterine devices.Trials had to have one of our primary outcomes: breast milk quantity or biochemical composition; lactation initiation, maintenance, or duration; infant growth; or timing of contraception initiation and effect on lactation. Secondary outcomes included contraceptive efficacy while breastfeeding and birth interval.For continuous variables, we calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For dichotomous outcomes, we computed the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI. Due to differing interventions and outcome , we did not aggregate the data in a meta-analysis.In 2014, we added seven trials for a new total of 11. Five reports were published before 1985 and six from 2005 to 2014. They included 1482 women. Four trials examined combined oral contraceptives (COCs), and three studied a -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS). We found two trials of progestin-only pills (POPs) and two of the etonogestrel-releasing implant. Older studies often lacked quantified results. Most trials did not report significant differences between the study arms in breastfeeding duration, breast milk composition, or infant growth. Exceptions were seen mainly in older studies with limited information.For breastfeeding duration, two of eight trials indicated a negative effect on lactation. A COC study reported a negative effect on lactation duration compared to placebo but did not quantify results. Another trial showed a lower percentage of the LNG-IUS group breastfeeding at 75 days versus the nonhormonal IUD group (reported P < 0.05) but no significant difference at one year.For breast milk volume, two older studies indicated lower volume for the COC group versus the placebo group. One trial did not quantify results. The other showed lower means (mL) for the COC group, e.g. at 16 weeks (MD -24.00, 95% CI -34.53 to -13.47) and at 24 weeks (MD -24.90, 95% CI -36.01 to -13.79). Another four trials did not report any significant difference between the study groups in milk volume or composition with two POPs, a COC, or the etonogestrel implant.Seven trials studied infant growth; one showed greater  gain (grams) for the etonogestrel implant versus no method for six weeks (MD 426.00, 95% CI 58.94 to 793.06) but less compared with depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) from 6 to 12 weeks (MD -271.00, 95% CI -355.10 to -186.90). The others studied POPs, COCs versus POPs, or an LNG-IUS.Results were not consistent across the 11 trials. The evidence was limited for any particular hormonal method. The quality of evidence was moderate overall and low for three of four placebo-controlled trials of COCs or POPs. The sensitivity analysis included six trials with moderate quality evidence and sufficient outcome data. Five trials indicated no significant difference between groups in breastfeeding duration (etonogestrel implant insertion times, COC versus POP, and LNG-IUS). For breast milk volume or composition, a COC study showed a negative effect, while an implant trial showed no significant difference. Of four trials that assessed infant growth, three indicated no significant difference between groups. One showed greater  gain in the etonogestrel implant group versus no method but less versus DMPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17636649>Danazol for heavy menstrual bleeding.</a></h2><p>Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is an important cause of ill health in pre menopausal women. Medical therapy, with the avoidance of possibly unnecessary surgery is an attractive treatment option, but there is considerable variation in practice and uncertainty about the most effective therapy. Danazol is a synthetic steroid with anti-oestrogenic and anti progestogenic activity, and weak androgenic properties. Danazol suppresses oestrogen and progesterone receptors in the endometrium, leading to endometrial atrophy (thinning of the lining of the uterus) and reduced menstrual loss and to amenorrhoea in some women.To determine the effectiveness and tolerability of Danazol when used for heavy menstrual bleeding in women of reproductive years.We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's Specialised Register (April 2007). We also searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2007), EMBASE (1980 to April 2007, CINAHL (1982 to April 2007). Attempts were also made to identify trials from citation lists of included trials and relevant review articles.Randomised controlled trials of Danazol versus placebo, any other medical (non-surgical) therapy or Danazol in different dosages for heavy menstrual bleeding in women of reproductive age with regular HMB measured either subjectively or objectively. Trials that included women with post menopausal bleeding, intermenstrual bleeding and pathological causes of heavy menstrual bleeding were excluded.Nine RCTs, with 353 women, were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Quality assessment and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers. The main outcomes were menstrual blood loss, the number of women experiencing adverse effects,  gain, withdrawals due to adverse effects and dysmenorrhoea. If data could not be extracted in a form suitable for meta-analysis, they were presented in a descriptive format.Most data were not in a form suitable for meta analysis, and the results are based on a small number of trials, all of which are under-powered. Danazol appears to be more effective than placebo, progestogens, NSAIDs and the OCP at reducing MBL, but confidence intervals were wide. Treatment with Danazol caused more adverse events than NSAIDs (OR 7.0; 95% CI 1.7 to 28.2) and progestogens (OR 4.05, 95% CI 1.6 to10.2). Danazol was shown to significantly lower the duration of menses when compared with NSAIDs (WMD -1.0; 95% CI -1.8 to -0.3) and a progesterone releasing IUD (WMD -6.0; 95% CI -7.3 to -4.8). There were no randomised trials comparing Danazol with tranexamic acid or the -releasing intrauterine system.Danazol appears to be an effective treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding compared to other medical treatments. The use of Danazol may be limited by its side effect profile, its acceptability to women and the need for continuing treatment. The small number of trials, and the small sample sizes of the included trials limit the recommendations for clinical care. Further studies are unlikely in the future and this review will not be updated unless further studies are identified.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18816505>Simultaneous determination of mifepristone and monodemethyl-mifepristone in human plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method using  as an internal standard: application to a pharmacokinetic study.</a></h2><p>A rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated to simultaneously determine mifepristone and monodemethyl-mifepristone in human plasma using  as the internal standard (IS). After solid-phase extraction of the plasma samples, mifepristone, monodemethyl-mifepristone and the IS were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis using electro-spray ionization (ESI) in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Chromatographic separation was performed on an XTERRA MS C(18) column (150 x 2.1 mm i.d., 5 microm). The method had a chromatographic run time of 4.5 min and linear calibration curves over the concentration ranges of 5-2000 ng/mL for mifepristone and monodemethyl-mifepristone. The recoveries of the method were found to be 94.5-103.7% for mifepristone and 70.7-77.3% for monodemethyl-mifepristone.

However, unpredictable menstrual bleeding constitutes the principal reason for premature discontinuation, particularly in the cases of the ENG-implant and the LNG-IUS.A randomized clinical trial was conducted between 2011 and 2013, and involved 297 women: 98 ENG-implant users, 99 LNG-IUS users and 100 TCu380A IUD users.Women accepting each contraceptive method were randomized into two groups after the women chose their contraceptive method. Group I received routine counselling at the clinic, including information on safety, efficacy and side effects, as well as what to expect regarding bleeding disturbances. Group II received 'intensive counselling'. In addition to the information provided to those in Group I, these women also received leaflets on their chosen method and were seen by the same three professionals, the most experienced at the clinic, throughout the year of follow-up. These three professionals went over all the information provided at each consultation. Women in both groups were instructed to return to the clinic after 45 (±7) days and at 6 and 12 (±1) months after insertion. They were instructed to record all bleeding episodes on a menstrual calendar specifically provided for this purpose. Additionally, satisfaction with the method was evaluated by a questionnaire completed by the women after 12 months of use of the contraceptive method.There were no significant differences between the intensive and routine counselling groups on the discontinuation rates due to unpredictable menstrual bleeding of the three contraceptives under evaluation. The 1-year cumulative discontinuation rates due to menstrual bleeding irregularities were 2.1, 2.7 and 4.0% and the continuation rates were 82.6, 81.0 and 73.2%, for the ENG-implant, the LNG-IUS or the TCu380A IUD users, respectively. The main reasons for discontinuation of the methods were  gain in users of the ENG-implant and expulsion of the TCu380A.The main limitations are that we cannot assure generalization of the results to another settings and that the routine counselling provided by our counsellors may already be appropriate for the women attending the clinic and so consequently intensive counselling including written leaflets was unable to influence the premature discontinuation rate due to unpredictable menstrual bleeding. Additionally, counselling could discourage some women from using the LARC methods offered in the study and consequently those women may have decided on other contraceptives.Routine counselling may be sufficient for many women to help reduce premature discontinuation rates and improve continuation rates and user satisfaction among new users of LARC methods.The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov ().The study was partially funded by the Fundação de Apoio a Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP) grant # 2012/01379-0, the Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq) grant #573747/2008-3 and by Merck (MSD), Brazil under an unrestricted grant.

Previous searches also included EMBASE.All randomized controlled trials were considered if they examined carbohydrate metabolism in women without diabetes who used hormonal contraceptives for contraception. Comparisons could be a placebo, a non-hormonal contraceptive, or another hormonal contraceptive that differed in drug, dosage, or regimen. Interventions included at least three cycles. Outcomes included glucose and insulin .We assessed all titles and abstracts identified during the literature searches. The data were extracted and entered into RevMan. We wrote to researchers for missing data. For continuous variables, the mean difference (MD) was computed with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model. For dichotomous outcomes, the Peto odds ratio with 95% CI was calculated.We found 31 trials that met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-one trials compared combined oral contraceptives (COCs); others examined different COC regimens, progestin-only pills, injectables, a vaginal ring, and implants. None included a placebo. Of 34 comparisons, eight had any notable difference between the study groups in an outcome.Twelve trials studied desogestrel-containing COCs, and the few differences from  COCs were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of two studies showed the desogestrel group had a higher mean fasting glucose (MD 0.20; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.41). Where data could not be combined, single studies showed lower mean fasting glucose (MD -0.40; 95% CI -0.72 to -0.08) and higher means for two-hour glucose response (MD 1.08; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.71) and insulin area under the curve (AUC) (MD 20.30; 95% CI 4.24 to 36.36).Three trials examined the etonogestrel vaginal ring and one examined an etonogestrel implant. One trial showed the ring group had lower mean AUC insulin than the -COC group (MD -204.51; 95% CI -389.64 to -19.38).Of eight trials of norethisterone preparations, five compared COCs and three compared injectables. In a COC trial, a norethisterone group had smaller mean change in glucose two-hour response than a -COC group (MD -0.30; 95% CI -0.54 to -0.06). In an injectable study, a group using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate had higher means than the group using norethisterone enanthate for fasting glucose (MD 10.05; 95% CI 3.16 to 16.94), glucose two-hour response (MD 17.00; 95% CI 5.67 to 28.33), and fasting insulin (MD 3.40; 95% CI 2.07 to 4.73).Among five recent trials, two examined newer COCs with different estrogen types. One showed the group with nomegestrel acetate plus 17β-estradiol had lower means than the  group for incremental AUC glucose (MD -1.43; 95% CI -2.55 to -0.31) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (MD -0.10; 95% CI -0.18 to -0.02). Two trials compared extended versus conventional (cyclic) regimens. With a dienogest COC, an extended-use group had greater mean change in AUC glucose (MD 82.00; 95% CI 10.72 to 153.28). In a small trial using two  COCs, the lower-dose group showed smaller mean change in fasting glucose (MD -3.00; 95% CI -5.89 to -0.11), but the obese and normal  women did not differ significantly.Current evidence suggests no major differences in carbohydrate metabolism between different hormonal contraceptives in women without diabetes. We cannot make strong statements due to having few studies that compared the same types of contraceptives. Many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses. Many of the earlier studies had limited reporting of methods.We still know very little about women at risk for metabolic problems due to being overweight. More than half of the trials had  restrictions as inclusion criteria. Only one small trial stratified the groups by  mass index (obese versus normal).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25220709>Safety and tolerability of a new low-dose contraceptive patch in obese and nonobese women.</a></h2><p>The safety and tolerability of a new low-dose /ethinyl estradiol (LNG/EE) contraceptive patch was compared with 2 combination oral contraceptives in 2 clinical studies in which approximately 30% of enrolled participants were obese.Two phase 3, open-label, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter trials compared the LNG/EE contraceptive patch (n = 1579) with combination oral contraceptives (n = 581) in healthy women 17-40 years of age. Combination oral contraceptives were LNG 100 μg per EE 20 μg (combination oral contraceptive 20; n = 375) or LNG 150 μg per EE 30 μg (combination oral contraceptive 30; n = 206). Safety and tolerability data from the 2 trials were evaluated in integrated safety analyses.Treatment-emergent adverse events of 2% or greater in the LNG/EE contraceptive patch were nasopharyngitis (5.2%), nausea (4.1%), upper respiratory infection (3.5%), headache (3.4%), sinusitis (2.9%), cervical dysplasia (2.3%), and urinary tract infection (2.1%). Including skin reaction-related treatment-emergent adverse events, the proportion of women who experienced any treatment-emergent adverse event was similar among women randomized to the contraceptive patch (47.5%), the combination oral contraceptive 20 (47.4%), or the combination oral contraceptive 30 (46.8%). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar in obese vs nonobese participants in all groups. Serious adverse events occurred in less than 1% of participants in any of the treatment groups.The LNG/EE contraceptive patch and combination oral contraceptives were well tolerated and associated with similar treatment-emergent adverse event incidences in obese and nonobese women.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

After clinical assessment, including Papanicolaou smear, endometrial biopsy, and pelvic sonography, the LNG-IUS was placed to treat their AUB.The median and range of age, parity, and  mass index were 45 years (34-49), 1 (0-4), and 38 kg/m(2) (26-52), respectively. All women were receiving warfarin therapy (4-12.5 mg/d) for previous venous thromboembolism. Some patients had additional comorbid conditions and were at high risk for traditional medical or surgical therapies. After placement of the LNG-IUS, all women reported menstrual reduction at 3 and 6 months. By 12 months, 1 woman with large fibroids expelled the LNG-IUS and was treated with transfemoral uterine artery embolization. Two women had amenorrhea, and 7 had hypomenorrhea. At 2 to 5 years, 1 woman expelled the LNG-IUS and hysterectomy indicated extensive adenomyosis in a 195-g uterus, and 1 woman had hysteroscopic endometrial ablation, 4 were menopausal, 2 had amenorrhea, and 1 had hypomenorrhea. In the 5 women with uterine fibroids measuring 4.2 to 147 cm(3), the fibroids were reduced in volume by approximately 75% in 2, were no longer detectable in 1, were subsequently shown to be adenomyoma in 1, and required uterine artery embolization in 1.In properly assessed and selected obese, premenopausal women with AUB receiving warfarin therapy and at high risk for traditional therapies, the LNG-IUS was an effective treatment in 70% of patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25843520>Bariatric Surgery: Does It Play a Role in Fertility-Preserving Treatment Among Obese Young Women With Endometrial Cancer?</a></h2><p>We present the case of a 17-year-old nulliparous woman with a history of obesity ( mass index 36.2 kg/m(2)), type 2 diabetes, and polycystic ovary syndrome, who was diagnosed with grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma without radiological evidence of myometrial invasion or metastatic disease. After failure of a fertility-preserving treatment with a -releasing intrauterine device, bariatric surgery was proposed to treat the obesity and improve control of her type 2 diabetes in an attempt to increase the chances of obtaining response to local treatment. Nine months after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and 18 months after insertion of the intrauterine device, the patient reached normal  ( mass index 20.3 kg/m(2)) and showed complete response to treatment. As far as we know, this is the first published case of an adolescent obese patient treated with bariatric surgery concomitantly with fertility-preserving management of endometrial cancer. We propose that bariatric surgery may play a role as an adjuvant therapy in fertility-preserving treatment of endometrial cancer with local progestin, in which it could enhance remission rates and reduce recurrence.Copyright © 2015 AAGL.

We conducted this study to assess whether limited sampling at steady state or measurements following use of one or two OCs could provide an adequate proxy in epidemiological studies for the progestin 24-h steady-state AUC of a particular OC.We conducted a 13-sample, 24-h pharmacokinetic study on both day 1 and day 21 of the first cycle of a monophasic OC containing 30-mcg ethinyl estradiol and 150-mcg  (LNG) in 17 normal- healthy White women and a single-dose 9-sample study of the same OC after a 1-month washout. We compared the 13-sample steady-state results with several steady-state and single-dose results calculated using parsimonious sampling schemes.The 13-sample steady-state 24-h LNG AUC was highly correlated with the steady-state 24-h trough value [r=0.95; 95% confidence interval (0.85, 0.98)] and with the steady-state 6-, 8-, 12- and 16-h values (0.92≤r≤0.95). The trough values after one or two doses were moderately correlated with the steady-state 24-h AUC value [r=0.70; 95% CI (0.27, 0.90) and 0.77; 95% CI (0.40, 0.92), respectively].Single time-point concentrations at steady state and after administration of one or two OCs gave highly to moderately correlated estimates of steady-state LNG AUC. Using such  could facilitate prospective pharmaco-epidemiologic studies of the OC and its side effects.A single time-point LNG concentration at steady state is an excellent proxy for complete and resource-intensive steady-state AUC measurement. The trough level after two single doses is a fair proxy for steady-state AUC. These results provide practical tools to facilitate large studies to investigate the relationship between systemic LNG exposure and side effects in a real-life setting.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The primary objective of the parent study was to assess the effect of initiation of the implant on the frequency of condom use. We compared study arms during follow-up using one-sided χ tests for differences in perceived  gain and loss, one-sided Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests for median gain in measured , and logistic regression with generalized estimating equations for risk of gaining greater than 2 kg.From 2012 to 2014, women were assigned to the implant (n=208) or delay arm (n=206). At 3 months, more women in the implant arm (15.3%) reported perceived  gain than in the control arm (4.3%) (P=.01). Despite differences in perception, the implant and control arms did not differ significantly in median  gain at 1-month (0.0 kg and 0.0 kg, respectively; P=.44) and 3-month visits (0.5 kg and 0.0 kg, respectively; P=.27). Study arms did not differ in risk of gaining greater than 2 kg (odds ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.6-1.3).We found no evidence of  gain from short-term implant use. Through the power of the nocebo effect, the practice of counseling women to expect possible  gain from initiating implant use could lead them to perceive  gain even in its absence and contribute to the early discontinuation of this highly effective contraceptive method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23812445>Nonsurgical treatment of endometrial hyperplasia: is the road less traveled the one we should be taking more?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20883778>Drug release and adhesive properties of crospovidone-containing matrix patches based on polyisobutene and acrylic adhesives.</a></h2><p>Ethinyl estradiol and  were insoluble in blends of high:medium:low molecular  polyisobutene adhesives (ratio: 1:5:0, 1:5:2 and 1:5:4) but soluble in acrylic adhesives (Durotak 87-202A, Durotak 87-2074 and Durotak 87-2677). The incorporation of drug adsorbates onto crospovidone into the polyisobutene blends yielded crystal-free patches. The drug release from these patches was independent of polyisobutene's molecular  distribution, probably because the drug release occurred mainly through fluid filled channels. By contrast, the drug release from acrylic adhesives was independent of whether the patches contained pure drugs or drug adsorbates onto crospovidone. A higher degree of saturation (or supersaturation) in these systems resulted in a higher thermodynamic activity of the drugs and hence a higher drug release. The crystal-free acrylic and polyisobutene patches did not show drug recrystallization after 3 months at 25°C/60 RH and 40°C/75 RH. The adhesive properties of polyisobutene patches were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The area under the curve of force-distance curves recorded with the texture analyzer correlated well with the in vivo skin adhesion. The elongation at detachment showed the same trend as the in vivo matrix creep. Crospovidone contents ≤ 30% had no detrimental effect on the adhesive properties of the patches.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Blood samples were collected at pre-treatment and at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up, for packed cell volume, platelet count, prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time. Statistical analysis was with paired t-tests. The level of significance was set at 5%. Each subject received a menstrual calendar to chart all bleeding and spotting events. The mean age and  of acceptors were 32.5 +/- 6.1 years and 63.6 +/- 9.6 kg, respectively. Mean packed cell volume (PCV) was 35.2 +/- 2.9% at pre-insertion. This rose to significant mean +/- SD values of 36.5 +/- 3.1%; p<0.05, 38.5 +/- 2.8%; p<0.0001 and 38.4 +/- 3.6%; p<0.0001 at 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively when compared with the pre-insertion mean value. The mean values of the platelet count showed no significant change at 3 months (238,448 +/- 68,618 mm(3); p>0.9), compared with pre-treatment value (240,545 +/- 96,769 mm(3)). There was a significant reduction in mean concentration at 6 months (p<0.009; 191,364 +/- 55,531 mm(3)) and at 12 months (p<0.003; 202,773 +/- 81,544 mm(3)) follow-up. The prothrombin and the partial thromboplastin time did not show significant change over their pre-insertion mean values of 12.0 +/- 1.1 s and 36.9 +/- 2.9 s, respectively. At 12 months, 79.5% (35) of the users reported an abnormal menstrual pattern, which included 54.5% (24) reduced bleeding pattern, 20.5% (9) increased bleeding and 4.5% (2) of combination of patterns. Only 20.5% (9) had a normal menstrual pattern. The continuation rate was 98%, as one user discontinued because of headaches. Norplant (the registered trademark of the Population Council for  subdermal implants) had an effect on the bleeding pattern - mainly reduced bleeding.

The mass-transfer resistance depends on the particle size but some practical limits exist not to reach the theoretically expected plate height and mass-transfer resistance. Another approach applies particles with shortened diffusion path to enhance the efficiency of separations. In this study a systematical evaluation of the possibilities of the separations obtained with 5 cm long narrow bore columns packed with new 2.6 microm shell particles (1.9 microm nonporous core surrounded by a 0.35 microm porous shell, Kinetex, Core-Shell), packed with other shell-type particles (Ascentis Express, Fused-Core), totally porous sub-2 microm particles and a 5 cm long narrow bore monolith column is presented. The different commercially available columns were compared by using van Deemter, Knox and kinetic plots. Theoretical Poppe plots were constructed for each column to compare their kinetic performance. Data are presented on polar neutral real-life analytes. Comparison of a low molecular  compounds (MW=270-430) and a high molecular  one (MW approximately 900) was conducted. This study proves that the Kinetex column packed with 2.6 microm shell particles is worthy of rivaling to sub-2 microm columns and other commercially available shell-type packings (Ascentis Express or Halo), both for small and large molecule separation. The Kinetex column offers a very flat C term. Utilizing this feature, high flow rates can be applied to accomplish very fast separations without significant loss in efficiency.Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It contains a reservoir of 52 mg of  (LNG) with continuous release of the steroid. Its contraceptive use is approved for 5 years. The aim of this study was to determine the plasma concentration of LNG and its variation with time in patients with in-dwelling LNG-IUS Mirena®.In this study, we determined LNG plasma concentrations in 110 women with LNG-IUS at different time points of use. Time from insertion of the system in the study population ranged from 20 days to 11.1 years. Quantitative LNG levels were determined using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay.The mean±SD LNG plasma level in all women was 147±59 pg/mL. A highly significant negative correlation between LNG plasma level and LNG-IUS time of use could be demonstrated. In the first year of use, LNG plasma level was as high as 191±71 pg/mL, decreasing to 157±68 pg/mL in the second year and 134±41 pg/mL in the third year. Even after exceeding the recommended period of LNG-IUS use, systemic LNG concentrations were detectable: 133±38 pg/mL in the sixth year, 133±48 pg/mL in the seventh year and 117±45 pg/mL in the eighth year. Furthermore, a significant negative correlation between LNG plasma level and  mass index could be shown.Systemic LNG concentrations can be found in all patients with LNG-IUS IUS. However, concentrations are much lower than in other forms of LNG application. Moreover, this study demonstrates that a systemic effect of LNG-IUS can also be found after the recommended contraceptive lifespan of 5 years.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Many POCs are long-acting, cost-effective methods of preventing pregnancy. However, concern about  gain can deter the initiation of contraceptives and cause early discontinuation among users.The primary objective was to evaluate the association between progestin-only contraceptive use and changes in .Through May 2013, we searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, POPLINE, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. The 2010 search also included EMBASE. For the initial review, we contacted investigators to identify other trials.All comparative studies were eligible that examined a POC versus another contraceptive method or no contraceptive. The primary outcome was mean change in  or mean change in  composition. We also considered the dichotomous outcome of loss or gain of a specified amount of .Two authors extracted the data. We computed the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous variables. For dichotomous outcomes, the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI was calculated.We found 16 studies; one examined progestin-only pills, one studied the -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), four examined an implant, and 10 focused on depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). Outcomes examined were changes in  only (14 studies), changes in both  and  composition (1 study), and changes in  composition only (1 study). We did not conduct meta-analysis due to the various contraceptive methods and  change .Comparison groups did not differ significantly for  change in 12 studies. However, three studies showed  change differences for POC users compared to women not using a hormonal method. In one study,  gain (kg) was greater for the DMPA group than the group using a non-hormonal IUD in years one through three [(MD 2.28; 95% CI 1.79 to 2.77), (MD 2.71, 95% CI 2.12 to 3.30), and (MD 3.17; 95% CI 2.51 to 3.83), respectively]. The differences were notable within the normal  and overweight subgroups. Two implant studies also showed differences in  change. The implant group (six-capsule) had greater  gain (kg) compared to the group using a non-hormonal IUD in both studies [(MD 0.47 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.65); (MD 1.10; 95% CI 0.36 to 1.84)]. In one of those studies, the implant group also had greater  gain than a group using a barrier method or no contraceptive (MD 0.74; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.96).The two studies that assessed  composition change showed differences between POC users and women not using a hormonal method. Adolescents using DMPA had a greater increase in  fat (%) compared to a group not using a hormonal method (MD 11.00; 95% CI 2.64 to 19.36). The DMPA group also had a greater decrease in lean  mass (%) (MD -4.00; 95% CI -6.93 to -1.07). The other study reported differences between an LNG-IUS group and a non-hormonal IUD group in percent change in  fat mass (2.5% versus -1.3%, respectively; reported P value = 0.029) and percent change in lean  mass (-1.4% versus 1.0%, respectively; reported P value = 0.027).The overall quality of evidence was moderate to low, given that the studies were evenly divided across the evidence quality groups (high, moderate, low, or very low quality). We found limited evidence of  gain when using POCs. Mean gain was less than 2 kg for most studies up to 12 months.  change for the POC group generally did not differ significantly from that of the comparison group using another contraceptive. Two studies that assessed  composition showed that POC users had greater increases in  fat and decreases in lean  mass compared to users of non-hormonal methods. Appropriate counseling about typical  gain may help reduce discontinuation of contraceptives due to perceptions of  gain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17327307>Effects of medical therapy on insulin resistance and the cardiovascular system in polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h2><p>We aimed to determine the impact of medical therapy for symptom management on insulin resistance, metabolic profiles, and surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), an insulin-resistant pre-diabetes condition.One hundred overweight women (BMI >27 kg/m2), average age 31 years, who were nonsmokers, were not pregnant, did not have diabetes, and were off relevant medications for 3 months completed this 6-month open-label controlled trial. Randomization was to a control group (higher-dose oral contraceptive [OCP] 35 microg ethinyl estradiol [EE]/2 mg cyproterone acetate, metformin [1 g b.d.] or low-dose OCP [20 microg EE/100 microg  + aldactone 50 mg b.d.]). Primary outcome  were insulin resistance (area under curve on oral glucose tolerance test) and surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease including arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV]) and endothelial function.All treatments similarly and significantly improved symptoms including hirsutism and menstrual cycle length. Insulin resistance was improved by metformin and worsened by the high-dose OCP. Arterial stiffness worsened in the higher-dose OCP group (PWV 7.46 vs. 8.03 m/s, P < 0.05), related primarily to the increased insulin resistance.In overweight women with PCOS, metformin and low- and high-dose OCP preparations have similar efficacy but differential effects on insulin resistance and arterial function. These findings suggest that a low-dose OCP preparation may be preferable if contraception is needed and that metformin should be considered for symptomatic management, particularly in women with additional metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21609576>[Evaluation of -releasing intrauterine system in treatment of recurrent endometriosis after conservative surgery].</a></h2><p>To evaluate the efficiency of -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) in the treatment of recurrent endometriosis after conservative surgery or conservative surgery combined with medical treatment.Twenty-three patients with recurrent endometriosis after conservative surgery or conservative surgery combined with medical treatment were treated by LNG-IUS. All patients rejected further operation and had no desire of fertility. The visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of pain, menstrual model,  and serum CA125 level and the volume of ovarian endometriotic cysts before and after 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months of treatment were recorded and compared.(1) VAS score:after 12 months of using LNG-IUS, dysmenorrheal, chronic pelvic pain or dyspareunia were relieved significantly. VAS score were dropped from 5.9±2.3, 4.3±2.0 to 1.0±0.7, 1.4±1.1 (P<0.01). (2) Volum of cysts:after 6 months of using LNG-IUS, the volume of recurrent ovarian endometriotic cysts in 11 patients were reduced from (11.4±6.1) cm3 to (5.5±3.4) cm3 significantly (P<0.01). At 12 months of follow-up, it suggested that 2 patients' ovarian endometriotic cysts disappeared. At 24 months follow-up, 9 patients ovarian endometriotic cysts disappeared (3) CA125: serum CA125 decreased from (65.5±19.6) kU/L to (42.1±13.6) kU/L at 6 months after treatment remarkably (P<0.01). Continued to decrease after 12 months and then become steady. Irregular bleeding and spotting was the main side effects,  gain was also observed in few patients.LNG-IUS could be used in treatment of recurrent endometriosis after conservative surgery or conservative surgery combined with medical treatment effectively. It could relieve pain, reduce the level of CA125 and decrease the size of ovarian endometriotic cysts.

COC containing drospirenone (DRSP) is an analog of spironolactone, hence its antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic characteristics have been deemed beneficial, although the benefits and/or negative outcome of its usage have not been fully elucidated. We therefore hypothesized that COC with DRSP component will not affect glucose regulation and circulating corticosterone. Method Ten-week-old female Wistar rats were divided into three groups: control (CON), ethinylestradiol/drospirenone COC (EE/DRSP)-treated, and ethinylestradiol/ COC (EE/LN)-treated rats. The treatment lasted for 8 weeks. Results Results showed that with the exception of lipid profiles, EE/LN but not EE/DRSP COC treatment affected , glucose tolerance, plasma insulin, corticosterone, (IR), and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. Conclusion Taken together, the findings showed that the beneficial effect of EE/DRSP could possibly be through the DRSP component. The result also implies that COCs containing DRSP may be a better and safer means of contraception than those with LN with less cardiovascular risks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23134558>Efficacy of the  intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) in the prevention of the atypical endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer: retrospective data from selected obese menopausal symptomatic women.</a></h2><p>The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of  intrauterine system-releasing (LNG-IUS) insertion in preventing atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AH) and endometrial cancer (EC) in symptomatic postmenopausal overweight/obese women. A total of 34 overweight/obese postmenopausal women, presenting abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) and endometrial hyperplasia (EH), and who were submitted to LNG-IUS insertion, were identified from registry data. Endometrial histology at LNG-IUS insertion showed simple EH in 20 cases (58.8%), complex EH in 14 cases (41.2%). At 36 months, 91% of patients showed no recurrence of AUB and a significant reduction in the mean endometrial thickness (from 8.2 ± 2.2 to 3.2 ± 1.5 mm, p < 0.05) was observed. Histologic regression of EH was observed in 27 (79.4%) and 33 (97.5%) cases at 12 and 36 months, respectively. None of the women in which EH persisted, reported cellular atypia or cancer progression at 12 and 36 months of follow-up. LNG-IUS represents an effective treatment option to manage postmenopausal obese women affected by AUB and EH. The device seems to be able to prevent the onset of AH and EC in women at high risk. Further prospective controlled studies in a well selected group of women are needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30392989>[Contraception for adolescent : CNGOF Contraception guidelines].</a></h2><p>The goal is to establish dialogue and determine the needs and skill levels of adolescence. This concerns sexuality, the prevention of STIs, the informed choice of contraception to avoid an unplanned pregnancy. MéTHODES: A systematic review based on literature about contraception AND teenagers was performed using Pubmed, Cochrane, national and international recommendations.The surveillance of the teenager contraception must integrate more specifically: global health with a stability of  and corpulence, a sufficient calcium intake, the prevention of the sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and the vaccination against HPV. The 1st consultations with adolescent girls are an essential moment for dialogue in order to develop sexuality education. Main themes are: prevention of STIs with the use of condoms, detection of situations of precariousness or sexual abuse, and finally adherence to treatment to avoid unplanned pregnancy. Use of condoms associated with regular contraception is essential to assure a barrier against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (NP1). To preserve the patient confidentiality, the patient is received alone (Grade B). She must be reassured about respect of anonymity and availability of free treatment. Clinical examination collects , height, BMI and blood pressure (Grade C). It is important to give them the choice of contraceptive method and provide objective information on the different contraceptive methods (NP2). If there are any contraindications, when the first prescription is a pill, it must be a 1st or 2nd generation pill with . For some experts, it would be important to prescribe a pill at 30μg EE for better efficacy in case of forgetfulness in very young patients and for the good maintenance of bone mineralization (NP4). Information on long-acting reversible contraceptives, or LARCs, is essential. These contraceptive methods have proved their efficacy and their place in the first intention. (NP1).Prescribing contraception to a teenage girl requires the adaptation of the best treatment to her needs to prevent an unwanted pregnancy. This requires good information on prevention of STIs and on different methods of contraception in a confidence climate.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

On day 12 of each cycle, subjects began a 10-day regimen of solifenacin 10 mg QD, which is 2 times the suggested starting dose, or placebo. Subjects crossed over to the other treatment arm for the second cycle. Primary PK end points were C(max) and AUC from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC(0-24 h)) for EE and LNG. Women ranged in age from 20 to 37 years and had a mean  of 64 kg, mean height of 167.4 cm, and mean  mass index of 23 kg/m2. Seven women had never smoked, while 5 were former smokers and 12 were regular smokers. Safety assessments included the nature, frequency, and severity of spontaneously reported or observed adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiogram, laboratory values, and physical examination.Statistical analysis of AUC(0-24 h)/product of baseline concentration and total blood sampling time, and C(max)/baseline concentration ratios of solifenacin versus placebo for EE and LNG found the 90% CI to be within the predefined range of 0.8 to 1.25 (EE: 0.854-1.164 and 0.822-1.167; LNG: 0.920-1.125 and 0.910-1.139). The number of samples with non-quantifiable luteinizing hormone (LH) and folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) levels were comparable after administration of the OC with either solifenacin or placebo. The adverse event most frequently reported was dry mouth (solifenacin, n = 25 [9 mild, 13 moderate, and 3 severe] vs placebo, n = 1 [moderate]). There were no clinically relevant effects on vital signs, electrocardiogram, or laboratory parameters.A PK interaction between solifenacin and the OC containing EE and LNG was not found in this study.

Endometrial biopsy was obtained for all patients after 3 months of treatment. Response to treatment was defined based on the histopathology of the post treatment pipelle endometrial specimens in three categories of resolution, persistence and progression.Treatment response rate in patients in the LNG group was 89.3% (25 of 28 patients), versus 70.4% (19 of 27 patients) in patients in the medroxyprogesterone group. The rate of persistence was 10.7% (3 of 28 patients) and 22.2% (6 of 27 patients) in LNG and medroxyprogesterone groups respectively. No progression of endometrial hyperplasia observed in any of the patients in LNG group, but progression of endometrial hyperplasia was observed in 7.4% (2 of 27 patients) in the medroxyprogesterone group. There was no statistically significant difference between groups regarding the response to treatment (P = 0.15). Side effects such as bloating,  gain, fatigue and hair loss were comparable between the groups (P > 0.05). Hirsutism was significantly more in the medroxyprogesterone group than LNG group (P = 0.013).Results showed that the use of LNG for treating endometrial hyperplasia for 3 months was associated with high-treatment response rate and the low proportion of patients with progression compared to the use of medroxyprogesterone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30202545>State of emergency contraception in the U.S., 2018.</a></h2><p>Emergency contraception is indicated in instances of unprotected sexual intercourse, including reproductive coercion, sexual assault, and contraceptive failure.

Bibliographies of retrieved articles were reviewed to identify additional references.All identified studies published in English and involving efficacy and safety of estradiol valerate/dienogest as an oral contraceptive were reviewed.Estradiol valerate/dienogest is a 4-phasic oral contraceptive approved for the prevention of pregnancy. The 4-phasic design allows for acceptable cycle control with this hormonal combination. In efficacy trials of estradiol valerate/dienogest in women aged 18-35 years, the Pearl Index ranged from 0.40 to 1.64, a range comparable to that of other combination oral contraceptives. The safety profile was also similar to that of other oral contraceptives, with headache, metrorrhagia, breast tenderness, nausea or vomiting, acne, and  gain reported as the most common adverse effects. Menstrual bleeding patterns and cycle control with estradiol valerate/dienogest were comparable to those of a monophasic oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol/. Estradiol valerate/dienogest differs from other oral contraceptives in that it necessitates more stringent dosing guidelines for maximum contraceptive efficacy. New starts should be on the first day of menses only, and a back-up method of contraception is required for the first 9 days, as compared to 7 days with other oral contraceptives. Back-up contraception is usually required for any pill taken more than 12 hours later than scheduled.Estradiol valerate/dienogest is an effective oral contraceptive. Because it has more stringent start times and requires a longer duration of backup contraception and stricter adherence, estradiol valerate/dienogest should be reserved for patients who are intolerant of other combination oral contraceptives.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542520>Clarification of contraceptive drug pharmacokinetics in obesity.</a></h2><p>Related to concerns about the role of obesity in the efficacy of contraceptive drugs, a review of the literature was carried out in regard to the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and various progestins given by various routes of administration. Most studies show that obese women exhibit modestly lower plasma concentrations of these drugs (circa 30%) when given the same doses as normal- women. While the mechanism is uncertain, precedence in the literature suggests that this is due to -related differences in metabolism rates.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of EP-1 and its two components on fertility and spermatogenesis to elucidate the mechanisms underlying its contraceptive effect. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with 0.33 mgkg(-1) quinestrol (E group), 0.67 mgkg(-1)  (P group) or their combination (EP group) for 7 days and then killed on Days 21 or 42 after treatment for tissue analysis. On Day 21, the  of the cauda epididymis decreased significantly, while the  of the adrenal gland increased significantly in the E and EP groups compared with the  in the control group. In addition, there was a significant decrease in sperm number in the E and EP groups compared with the control group and there was less staining for the androgen receptor and Wilms' tumour nuclear protein 1 in the E and EP groups. The primary defects in E- or EP-treated rats were abnormal spermiogenesis, lack of elongating spermatids, and pachytene spermatocyte arrest. Analysis of MutL homologue 1 revealed that EP treatment inhibited chromosome recombination during meiosis, but did not cause obvious genetic abnormalities. These data demonstrate that quinestrol, alone or in combination with , induces subfertility in male rats mainly by interfering with germ cell differentiation. Thus, EP-1 or E alone may be effective contraceptive regimens for fertility control in rodents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25393993>Efavirenz- but not nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy decreases exposure to the  released from a sub-dermal contraceptive implant.</a></h2><p>Sub-dermal hormone implants, such as  (LNG), are a safe and desirable form of long-acting contraception, but their use among HIV-positive women on antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be compromised given the potential for a cytochrome P450 3A-mediated drug-drug interaction. Our study aimed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of LNG released from a sub-dermal implant over six months in HIV-positive Ugandan women on nevirapine (NVP)- or efavirenz (EFV)-based ART.This non-randomized, parallel group study compared LNG pharmacokinetics between HIV-positive Ugandan women not yet eligible for ART (control group, n=18) and those on stable NVP- (n=20) or EFV- (n=20) based ART. The two-rod (75 mg/rod) LNG sub-dermal implant was inserted at study enrolment. LNG sampling was obtained pre-implant and at weeks 1, 4, 12 and 24 post-insertion. LNG concentrations were analyzed using a validated LC-MS/MS method, with an assay calibration range of 50-1500 pg/mL. Safety monitoring, including a pregnancy test, was conducted at each study visit.At enrolment, participants had a mean age of 31 years; CD4+ cell counts were similar between the control, NVP and EFV groups (758, 645 and 568 cells/mm(3), respectively; p=0.09); all women in the NVP and EFV groups had an undetectable HIV-RNA. Women in the control group had a higher baseline  (73 kg) compared to those in the NVP (63 kg; p=0.03) or EFV groups (60 kg; p<0.01). By linear regression,  was a significant predictor of LNG concentrations (1 kg increase in =5 pg/mL decrease in LNG, p=0.03). LNG concentrations are reported in the table.Over a 24-week period, LNG concentrations were 40-54% lower in women on EFV-based ART, despite their having a significantly lower , compared to those not on ART. In women on NVP-based ART, LNG concentrations were 32-39% higher than those observed in the control group, a difference partially explained by . These data confirm a significant drug interaction occurs between the LNG implant and EFV, adding to growing concern for reduced contraceptive efficacy with their combined use. In contrast, these data support use of the LNG implant with NVP-based ART.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22079603>Predictors of noncompliance in an oral contraceptive clinical trial.</a></h2><p>This analysis was conducted to identify the participant characteristics associated with noncompliance in an oral contraceptive (OC) clinical trial.We studied ovarian suppression among normal- and obese women during the use of  (LNG)-containing combination OCs. Participants underwent twice weekly phlebotomy during the study cycle and received up to $360 for participation. Along with other study assays, we analyzed 903 specimens from 181 women to measure LNG to assess OC compliance. Consistently undetectable LNG levels indicated noncompliance. To evaluate predictors of OC noncompliance during this study, we compared the characteristics of compliant and noncompliant participants using multivariable logistic regression. We assigned each participant to a relative poverty level based on US census data; all other individual characteristics came directly from participant responses during the baseline interview.One hundred eighty-one women completed the study; 31 were noncompliant (17%). In multivariable analyses, poverty level was the strongest predictor of noncompliance. Compared with those women in the quartile with the lowest level of residential poverty, other women were far more likely to be noncompliant, especially women in the quartile with the greatest prevalence of poverty (adjusted odds ratio, 8.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-46.1). Additional factors associated with noncompliance were education level less than a bachelor's degree and Hispanic ethnicity. Other demographic and psychometric  were not associated with compliance.We found that noncompliance was strongly associated with residential poverty level, an indirect measure of individual income. In the United States, poverty is associated with female obesity, Hispanic ethnicity and low education, which were also associated here with noncompliance.

Although LNG-EC is considered to have no effects on the developing fetus if the contraceptive fails and pregnancy occurs, there have been a few studies specifically examining this issue. The purpose of this study was to compare the physical and mental development of children born after LNG-EC failure with that of a cohort of children born to mothers with no history of exposure to LNG or any teratogenic substances. A group of 195 children who were exposed to LNG-EC during their mothers' conception cycle (study group) were matched to a group of 214 children without exposure to LNG (control group). The physical and mental development of the children were evaluated and compared over a 2-yr period. There were four congenital malformations in the study group and three in the control group (2.1% vs. 1.4%, respectively, P > 0.05). Over the 2-yr follow-up period, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with respect to children's , height, head circumference, and intelligence scores, and the values of all parameters of both groups were similar to those of the national standards. In summary, LNG-EC has no effect on the physical growth, mental development, or occurrence of birth defects in children born from pregnancies in which EC failed.© 2014 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17874799>Ultrasound-induced destruction of low levels of estrogen hormones in aqueous solutions.</a></h2><p>The removal of estrogen hormones from water and wastewater is of importance due to their adverse effects toward ecosystems and potential risks to human health. The ultrasound-induced destruction of estrogen compounds in aqueous solutions is studied in a batch reactor using a 1.1 W/mL sonication unit and in a continuous flow reactor using a 2.1 W/mL sonication unit. The estrogen compounds of interest are 17alpha-estradiol, 17beta-estradiol, ethinyl estradiol, estrone, equilin, gestodene, , and norgestrel. Effects of process variables such as temperature, pH, and pressure are examined. The degradation of estrogens follows pseudo first-order kinetics. The reaction likely takes place in the interfacial region where supercritical environment is produced upon cavity implosion and in the bulk solution with radical species. Low solution pH is more favorable for destruction of estrogens. A kinetic degradation model is developed to predict the destruction of estrogen compounds. Low solution temperature shows favorable destruction of estrogens. Increasing the fluid pressure is detrimental to reaction efficiency.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20213838>In vivo absorption of steroidal hormones from smart polymer based delivery systems.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to develop smart polymer based controlled delivery systems to deliver steroidal hormones after single subcutaneous (s.c.) injection at predetermined rates over extended period of time. In vivo absorption and pharmacokinetics of  (LNG) and testosterone (TSN) were investigated from the thermosensitive and phase sensitive polymeric controlled delivery systems. A selective, reliable, and rapid method for determination of serum LNG concentration was developed using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandom mass spectrometry with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface (HPLC-MS-MS with APCI), while TSN in serum samples was detected and quantified by a competitive immunoassay. The delivery systems controlled the absorption of LNG in rabbits up to 6 weeks from thermosensitive and approximately 4 weeks from phase sensitive polymeric delivery systems. In vivo study of TSN delivery systems in castrated rabbits controlled the release of TSN for at least 2 months from both thermosensitive and phase sensitive polymers. Thermosensitive and phase sensitive polymer formulations significantly (p < 0.05) increased relative bioavailability of steroidal hormones compared to control. In conclusion, thermosensitive and phase sensitive polymer based delivery systems controlled the release in vivo in rabbits for longer duration after single s.c. injection.(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684471>Altered pharmacokinetics of combined oral contraceptives in obesity - multistudy assessment.</a></h2><p>The objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of  (LNG)-containing combined oral contraceptives (COCs) in obese women.We pooled and reanalyzed data from 89 women with different  mass index (BMI) categories from four clinical studies. The LNG and ethinyl estradiol (EE) PKs were analyzed utilizing a zero-order absorption (K), two-compartment PK model to evaluate key PK parameters in relation to a range of , BMI and  surface area (BSA).Increasing of  habitus metrics is correlated with decreasing C (p<.0001) and AUC (p<.05) for both LNG and EE, but no correlation was found for C (p≥.17). Increasing  and BMI were associated with a modest increase (p≤.056) of clearance (CL) and appreciable increases of central volume (V, p<.05), distribution clearance (CLd, p≤.001) and peripheral volume (V, p<.0001) for LNG. For EE, increases in CL (p≤.009) were found with greater , BMI and BSA. Values of V, CLd and V also increased (p<.0001) in obese subjects. The half-life and steady-state volume were greater among obese women (p<.0001) for both LNG and EE. LNG and EE PK parameters correlated well (p≤.006 for all), indicating that individual subject physiology affected both drugs similarly.The primary effects of obesity on LNG and EE were a modest increase in CL and a marked increase in distribution parameters. We observed no obesity-related differences in trough LNG and EE concentrations.This population PK analysis demonstrated reduced systemic exposure to LNG/EE oral contraceptives in obese subjects (C and AUC); these particular differences are unlikely to lower contraceptive effectiveness among obese women who are correctly using LNG-containing contraceptives.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A visual analogue scale (VAS) of dysmenorrhea, uterine volume and serum CA125 levels were used to assess the efficacy of the treatment at baseline and 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after the LNG-IUS insertion. Side effects were recorded at every follow-up visit.The VAS of dysmenorrhea dropped continuously and significantly from the baseline score of 77.9+/-14.7 to 11.8+/-17.9 after 36 months of the LNG-IUS insertion (p<.001). The uterine volume decreased significantly from 113.8+/-46.9 mL to 94.5+/-40.1 mL (p=.003) at 6 months and to 87.7+/-35.8 mL (p<.001) at 12 months and then rose slightly, but the variables at 24 and 36 months still decreased significantly in comparison with the baseline variable (p<.001). The serum CA125 levels reduced significantly starting from 6 months after device insertion (p<.001). The most common side effects were  gain (28.7%), simple ovarian cyst formation (22.3%) and lower abdominal pain (12.8%). At 36 months, the overall satisfaction rate of the treatment was 72.5%.The LNG-IUS appears to be an effective method in alleviating dysmenorrhea associated with adenomyosis during 3 years.

To address this issue we investigated whether higher bodyweight and/or BMI negatively impacted the risk of pregnancy in women receiving LNG-EC ( - emergency contraception) after unprotected sexual intercourse in a pooled analysis of three large multinational RCTs conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO).A pooled analysis of three double-blind, multinational RCTs conducted by the WHO to investigate the efficacy of LNG-EC in the general population. All analyses were done on the per-protocol set (PPS) which included 5812 women who received LNG-EC within 72 hours following unprotected sexual intercourse. The analysis was based on logistic regression, with pregnancy as the outcome. BMI and  were represented in the same model.A total of 56 pregnancies were available for analysis in the PPS. Increasing bodyweight and BMI were not correlated with an increased risk of pregnancy in the studied population. A limitation of this study is that despite the large study population in the pooled analysis there were relatively small numbers of women in the high-BMI and high-bodyweight subgroups.LNG-EC is effective for preventing pregnancy after unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure and no evidence was found to support the hypothesis of a loss of EC efficacy in subjects with high BMI or bodyweight. Therefore, access to LNG-EC should not be limited only to women of lower bodyweight or BMI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29278560>Are hormonal contraceptives less effective in overweight and obese women?</a></h2><p>Loss of efficacy of hormonal contraceptives is of particular concern for women who are overweight or obese. Only recently have clinical trials started to include overweight and obese women in their study populations, limiting the data available on which to make the best prescribing decisions for hormonal contraceptives for these patients.

Two main methods are currently available: oral pills or the copper-T intrauterine device. In recent years there has been some debate regarding the efficacy of oral therapy in obese women. In this brief commentary we review new evidence, published after the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) referral of 2014, relating to the effect of obesity on the pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy of  EC in light of some of the concerns that have been raised.  A PubMed literature search ("" and "emergency contraception") was conducted between 1 January 2005 to 31 March 2018; results from the main clinical trials are discussed. Additional literature known to the authors and identified from the reference lists of cited publications was included.  Overall, it should be noted that, in studies which determined pregnancy rates across different  or BMI categories, the overall pregnancy rate was low (1-2%) and there was no direct evidence that lower  plasma levels contributed to an increased pregnancy rate in obese women. This conclusion was reached by the EMA referral in 2014 and they concluded that emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) could be taken regardless of  or BMI, as soon as possible after UPSI. Since the EMA review, additional evidence has been published regarding this topic. This includes PK data (which can neither support, nor deny the previously submitted meta-analyses during the Article 31 Referral procedure), or re-analyses of the previously submitted data.  Evidence published since the EMA referral in 2014 does not change the original conclusions of the agency, which recommended that ECPs could be taken regardless of  or BMI, as soon as possible after UPSI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18569277>Menorrhagia and severe menstrual pain related to the use of adalimumab in a psoriatic.</a></h2><p>The case is reported of a 32-year-old morbidly obese white woman who used adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 4 months for psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis vulgaris and inverse psoriasis with total clearance of her psoriasis who developed menorrhagia (at least twice the number of pads used daily for 4-6 days as opposed to 3-5 days previously) and severe menstrual pain.

However, there is some evidence that its life span may be longer. The aim of the study was to evaluate serum  (LNG) and estradiol (E(2)) levels and endometrial thickness every 6 months from 7 to 8 1/2 years after insertion.At the end of the approved 5-year life span, no replacement devices were available; therefore, 86 women were allowed to retain the same device for a further 2 years. At the 7-year follow-up visit, the women who consented were again allowed to retain the same device for a further 18 months and were followed-up at six-monthly intervals. At each visit, vaginal sonography was performed to measure endometrial thickness, and a blood sample was taken to measure LNG and E(2).Eighty-four months after insertion, 67 women aged 34.3+/-0.8 years (mean+/-SEM) (range, 25-49 years) returned for follow-up. Mean+/-SEM LNG levels decreased from an initial 253+/-27 pg/mL (range, 86-760) during the first 2 months following insertion to 137+/-12 (range, 23-393) at 84 months and 119+/-9 pg/mL (range, 110-129) at 102 months of use (+/-SEM). At 84 months of use, mean+/-SEM endometrial thickness was 2.8+/-0.1 mm, increasing to 3.8+/-0.5 mm at 102 months of use. The incidence of amenorrhea decreased from 41.8% at 84 months to 31.5% at 102 months of use. No correlation was found between LNG levels and bleeding patterns; however, a weak correlation was found between high  mass index (kg/m(2)), high , and low serum LNG levels. E(2) levels were similar to those of the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle of regularly menstruating women.During extended use of the LNG-IUS, serum LNG levels were nearly half those found in the first 2 months of use (Wilcoxon signed rank test); serum E(2) levels were normal. Despite the very thin endometrium, menstrual bleeding was reinstated in many cases. At the end of its 5-year life span, there is a window for changing the LNG-IUS, and physicians and users should not be concerned about delaying replacement of the device for a short time beyond the approved life span; however, maintaining the same device long after its approved life span cannot be recommended.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23153699>Effects of quinestrol and  on prolactin serum concentration in lactating Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) and reproductive parameters of their offspring.</a></h2><p>The effects of the two sterilants, quinestrol (QE) and  (LNG) on serum prolactin (PRL) level in lactating Mongolian gerbils and reproductive parameters of their offspring were examined in the study. Both sterilants increased the serum PRL level in lactating gerbils. The  as well as  of the ovary, testis, epididymides, and seminal vesicles were lower, whereas that of the uterus was higher in the pups originating from QE-treated mothers in comparison to controls. Histological ovarian sections of the offspring from QE-treated mothers contained only growing follicles, whereas their uterine sections showed a thinner endometrium, thicker myometrium, and greater epithelial-cell height than in controls. The histometrical testis characteristics as well as sperm concentration and motility of male pups from QE-treated mothers were lower compared to those of the control group. The serum gonadotropin levels of female pups from mothers treated with QE were lower, whereas the serum estradiol (E(2)) and progesterone (P(4)) levels were higher than in control gerbils. In contrast, serum gonadotropin and testosterone (T) levels of male pups from QE-treated mothers were lower compared to controls. LNG did not affect the examined parameters of the offspring. The offspring from QE-treated mothers was infertile, whereas the offspring from LNG-treated mothers was fertile. In summary, QE and LNG have a stimulatory effect on PRL level in lactating gerbils. It also appears that QE administered via milk to mothers affects reproductive processes of their offspring.Copyright © 2012 Society for Biology of Reproduction & the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in Olsztyn.

Serum samples obtained at several time points during active pill use and hormone-free intervals were analyzed for AMH, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol and inhibin B.AMH levels did not differ by OC cycle day in either BMI group. On average, AMH levels were 34% lower in the obese group (2.9+/-2.1 vs. 4.4+/-1.8 ng/mL, p<.05). Modeling to determine differences in AMH throughout the cycle based on obesity status demonstrated significantly lower levels (p<.05), whereas serum AMH, FSH, LH, estradiol and inhibin B levels revealed no correlations when all time points were included.In reproductive-age women, serum AMH levels do not appear to fluctuate during OC use, but AMH levels are significantly lower in obese women. Lower levels do not appear to be due to differences in gonadotropin levels or ovarian activity.Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Both access and available options for emergency contraception have changed over the last several years.Emergency contraceptive pills can be less effective in obese women. The maximum achieved serum concentration of  (LNG) is lower in obese women than women of normal BMI, and doubling the dose of LNG (3 mg) increases its concentration maximum, approximating the level in normal BMI women receiving one dose of LNG. Repeated use of both LNG and ulipristal acetate (UPA) is well tolerated. Hormonal contraception can be immediately started following LNG use, but should be delayed for 5 days after UPA use to avoid dampening the efficacy of UPA. The copper intrauterine device (IUD) is the only IUD approved for emergency contraception (and the most effective method of emergency contraception), but use of LNG IUD as emergency contraception is currently being investigated. Accurate knowledge about emergency contraception remains low both for patients and healthcare providers.Emergency contraception is an important yet underutilized tool available to women to prevent pregnancy. Current options including copper IUD and emergency contraceptive pills are safe and well tolerated. Significant gaps in knowledge of emergency contraception on both the provider and user level exist, as do barriers to expedient access of emergency contraception.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23979828>[Venous thromboembolism in adolescents associated with fourth-generation oral contraceptives].</a></h2><p>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a rare, but feared adverse drug reaction of combined oral contraceptives. Modern oral contraceptives contain novel progestins, which are suspected of causing thrombotic events more frequently than well-known progestins. Drospirenone is one of those new fourth-generation progestins with antiandrogenic and antimineralocorticoid effects. Especially girls and young women do not only wish for contraception, but also for positive effects on skin and . In the last decade, however, the safety of this progestin was often under discussion.A detailed literature search was conducted to obtain an overview of currently available data on the risk of VTE among girls and young women using drospirenone-containing contraceptives. It appears that drospirenone-containing contraceptives have a similar increase in risk as third-generation oral contraceptives and antiandrogens. Compared to second-generation contraceptives containing the progestin  there is an approximate 2-fold risk increase (1.0 to 2.8-fold) in women aged 10-55 years. Accurate data regarding the risk in the age group under 18 years are lacking. Nevertheless, the risk of VTE appears to be higher in young -women during the first months of treatment. Until more data for nov-el progestins are available and the safety profile is well defined well-studied second-generation oral contraceptives with low dose estrogen and better risk-benefit ratio should be preferred in young women. In any case, all patients should be comprehensively informed regarding the benefits and risks of each contraceptive method.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22299599>Effect of the ethinylestradiol/ combined oral contraceptive on the activity of cytochrome P4503A in obese women.</a></h2><p>While it is known that CYP3A4/5 activity is decreased with combined oral contraceptive (COC) use and obesity suppresses CYP expression, the combined effects of obesity and COC use on CYP3A4/5 activity are unclear. Therefore, our aim was to examine the effect of COC usage on CYP3A4/5 activity in obese women.Thirty-four, obese ( mass index, BMI > 30 kg m(-2)) women of reproductive age (18-35 years old) were placed on a COC pill containing 20 µg ethinylestradiol/100 µg  for 21 days starting at the onset of menses. A midazolam pharmacokinetic study was conducted prior to initiation and after 21 days of COC treatment. Serial blood samples were collected and plasma concentrations of midazolam were measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using a non-compartmental method.Midazolam clearance, a surrogate measure of CYP3A4/5 activity, was significantly decreased upon COC use (63.3 l h(-1) vs. 53.9 l h(-1), P < 0.05). A median decrease of 5.6 l h(-1) (95% CI -4.1, 13.3 l h(-1)) was observed. However, the magnitude of change was similar to that reported in women with normal BMI.Although we hypothesized that obesity might amplify the impact on CYP3A4/5 activity in COC users, we found that this was not the case. This finding is reassuring regarding potential additional drug-drug interactions in obese COC users as CYP3A4/5 is a major enzyme in the metabolism of many marketed drugs.© 2012 The Authors.

Alterations may include decreased glucose tolerance and increased insulin resistance, which are risk factors for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. These issues have been raised primarily with contraceptives containing estrogen.To evaluate the effect of hormonal contraceptives on carbohydrate metabolism in healthy women and those at risk for diabetes due to overweight.In April 2014, we searched the computerized databases MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, and LILACS for studies of hormonal contraceptives and carbohydrate metabolism. We also searched for clinical trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. The initial search also included EMBASE.All randomized controlled trials were considered if they examined carbohydrate metabolism in women without diabetes who used hormonal contraceptives for contraception. Comparisons could be a placebo, a non-hormonal contraceptive, or another hormonal contraceptive that differed in drug, dosage, or regimen. Interventions included at least three cycles. Outcomes included glucose and insulin .We assessed all titles and abstracts identified during the literature searches. The data were extracted and entered into RevMan. We wrote to researchers for missing data. For continuous variables, the mean difference (MD) was computed with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model. For dichotomous outcomes, the Peto odds ratio with 95% CI was calculated.We found 31 trials that met the inclusion criteria. No new trials were eligible in 2014. Twenty-one trials compared combined oral contraceptives (COCs); others examined different COC regimens, progestin-only pills, injectables, a vaginal ring, and implants. None included a placebo. Of 34 comparisons, eight had any notable difference between the study groups in an outcome.Twelve trials studied desogestrel-containing COCs, and the few differences from  COCs were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of two studies showed the desogestrel group had a higher mean fasting glucose (MD 0.20; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.41). Where data could not be combined, single studies showed lower mean fasting glucose (MD -0.40; 95% CI -0.72 to -0.08) and higher means for two-hour glucose response (MD 1.08; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.71) and insulin area under the curve (AUC) (MD 20.30; 95% CI 4.24 to 36.36).Three trials examined the etonogestrel vaginal ring and one examined an etonogestrel implant. One trial showed the ring group had lower mean AUC insulin than the -COC group (MD -204.51; 95% CI -389.64 to -19.38).Of eight trials of norethisterone preparations, five compared COCs and three compared injectables. In a COC trial, a norethisterone group had smaller mean change in glucose two-hour response than a -COC group (MD -0.30; 95% CI -0.54 to -0.06). In an injectable study, a group using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate had higher means than the group using norethisterone enanthate for fasting glucose (MD 10.05; 95% CI 3.16 to 16.94), glucose two-hour response (MD 17.00; 95% CI 5.67 to 28.33), and fasting insulin (MD 3.40; 95% CI 2.07 to 4.73).Among five recent trials, two examined newer COCs with different estrogen types. One showed the group with nomegestrel acetate plus 17β-estradiol had lower means than the  group for incremental AUC glucose (MD -1.43; 95% CI -2.55 to -0.31) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (MD -0.10; 95% CI -0.18 to -0.02). Two trials compared extended versus conventional (cyclic) regimens. With a dienogest COC, an extended-use group had greater mean change in AUC glucose (MD 82.00; 95% CI 10.72 to 153.28). In a small trial using two  COCs, the lower-dose group showed smaller mean change in fasting glucose (MD -3.00; 95% CI -5.89 to -0.11), but the obese and normal  women did not differ significantly.Current evidence suggests no major differences in carbohydrate metabolism between different hormonal contraceptives in women without diabetes. We cannot make strong statements due to having few studies that compared the same types of contraceptives. Many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses. Many of the earlier studies had limited reporting of methods.We still know very little about women at risk for metabolic problems due to being overweight. More than half of the trials had  restrictions as inclusion criteria. Only one small trial stratified the groups by  mass index (obese versus normal).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24324023>Plan B emergency contraceptive may be ineffective for heavier women.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27153743>Progestin-only contraception and thromboembolism: A systematic review.</a></h2><p>Women with medical conditions associated with increased risk for thrombosis generally should not use estrogen-containing contraceptives; however, less is known about progestin-only contraceptives (POCs) and thrombosis risk.The objective was to identify evidence regarding the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or arterial thromboembolism [stroke or acute myocardial infarction (AMI)] among women using POCs.We searched the PubMed database for all articles published from database inception through January 2016 for studies examining thrombosis among women using POCs. We included studies which examined women with medical conditions associated with thrombosis risk, as well as studies of women in the general population (either without these conditions or who were not specified to have these conditions). Hormonal contraceptives of interest included progestin-only pills (POPs), injectables, implants and -releasing intrauterine devices (LNG-IUDs). Outcomes of interest included VTE, stroke and AMI.There were 26 articles of good to poor quality that met inclusion criteria; 9 studies examined women with medical conditions and 20 examined women in the general population. Two studies found that, among smokers and women with certain thrombogenic mutations, use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) had elevated odds of VTE compared with nonsmokers or those without mutations, although confidence intervals were wide and overlapped with odds among nonusers. One study found that, among women with previous VTE, use of POCs (including DMPA) was associated with a nonsignificant increased odds of recurrent VTE (all of which were among DMPA users); two other studies that examined POCs other than DMPA did not observe an association with recurrent VTE. Two studies found that use of DMPA among healthy women was also associated with increased odds of VTE. Two studies found that use of POCs for therapeutic indications was associated with increased odds of VTE. Studies did not find increased odds of VTE with POPs for contraceptive purposes, implants or LNG-IUDs nor were there increased odds of stroke or AMI with any POCs.The majority of evidence identified by this systematic review did not suggest an increase in odds for venous or arterial events with use of most POCs. Limited evidence suggested increased odds of VTE with use of injectables (three studies) and use of POCs for therapeutic indications (two studies, one with POCs unspecified and the other with POPs). Any increase in risk likely translates to a small increase in absolute numbers of thrombotic events at the population level.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23196315>Oral contraceptive pills decrease pulmonary airway resistance in healthy north Indian women.</a></h2><p>Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are hormonal pills used by females to prevent conception; they are a combination of estrogen and progestin. There is, however, compelling evidence that throughout the reproductive life of a woman, her airways are subject to the influence of the cyclical variations in sex hormones which occur in relation to circadian rhythms. The present study has been designed to investigate the effects of OCPs on airway resistance in terms of spirometric parameters in OCP users and nonusers.A total of 100 women (age: 20-40 years) ware selected for the present study. The subjects were provided with a one-month supply of OCPs. The constituents per tablet of MALA-N used were  0.15 mg and ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), forced expiratory flow in expiring 25-75% air (FEF 25-75), forced expiratory volume percentage in one second (FEV1% or FEV1/FVC), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were recorded.In our study, the FEF 25-75and PEFR increased significantly in OCP users, showing that these hormone pills decrease the resistance offered by small bronchioles.</p></html>
