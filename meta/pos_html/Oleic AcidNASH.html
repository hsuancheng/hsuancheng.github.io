The aim of this study was to address the mechanism of Gardenoside on HepG2 cellular steatosis induced by free fatty acids (FFAs). The model of HepG2 steatosis was duplicated by  and palmitic  at the proportion of 2:1 (FFAs mixture) for 24 h, then lipid toxicity was induced. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) were used to detect cell viability and Oil Red O staining method was used to judge the lipid accumulation respectively. Inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and intracellular NFκB were measured after 24 h. The steatosis was significantly decreased after Gardenoside treatment without cytotoxicity. TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 were modulated to HepG2 cells by treatment of Gardenoside. In the meantime, the activation of NFκB was inhibited by Gardenoside. Gardenoside has a protective effect on FFA-induced cellular steatosis in HepG2 cells which indicates that Gardenoside might be a potential therapeutic herb against  by suppressed supernatant inflammatory cytokine production and intracellular NFkB activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27756518>Intracellular and extracellular miRNome deregulation in cellular models of NAFLD or : Clinical implications.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents the most common chronic liver disease in industrialized countries. NAFLD has the potential to progress through the inflammatory phase of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Identifying patients at risk for this transition is a relevant clinical challenge. The complexity of these phenotypes in vivo made necessary the development of in vitro models in order to dissect the molecular signalling affected in NAFLD and , but also to identify potential circulating biomarkers.We profiled the expression of 754 cellular and medium-secreted human miRNAs in HepG2 cells after lipotoxic (Palmitate, model of ) or not-lipotoxic stimuli (Oleate-Palmitate, model of NAFLD). Results were validated through Single TaqMan assays. We performed computational analysis of miRNA targets and pathways. Oleate-palmitate treatment induced a variation of 2.8% and 10% of total miRNAs in cells and medium, respectively; palmitate treatment caused 10% and 19% intracellular and extracellular miRNA deregulation, respectively. We validated miR-126, miR-150, miR-223, miR-483-3p, miR-1226*, and miR-1290 deregulation. Through computational analysis, we observed that targets of both intracellular and extracellular DE miRNAs were involved in processes associated with the onset and progression of NAFLD and , such as fatty  metabolism, apoptosis and inflammation.These data would be useful to elucidate the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis and progression of the NAFLD spectrum, but they also allow the identification of novel potential biomarkers for differential diagnosis to be tested in vivo.Copyright Â© 2016 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

However, it is not known whether the expression of alcohol metabolism genes is altered in the livers of simple steatosis. There is also a current debate on whether fatty acids induce CYP2E1 in fatty livers. In this study, expression of alcohol metabolizing genes in the liver biopsies of simple steatosis patients was examined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), in comparison to biopsies of  livers and normal controls. Induction of alcohol metabolizing genes was also examined in cultured HepG2 cells treated with ethanol or , by qRT-PCR and Western blots. We found that the mRNA expression of alcohol metabolizing genes including ADH1C, ADH4, ADH6, catalase and CYP2E1 was elevated in the livers of simple steatosis, to similar levels found in  livers. In cultured HepG2 cells, ethanol induced the expression of CYP2E1 mRNA and protein, but not ADH4 or ADH6;  did not induce any of these genes. These results suggest that elevated alcohol metabolism may contribute to the pathogenesis of NAFLD at the stage of simple steatosis as well as more severe stages. Our in vitro data support that CYP2E1 is induced by endogenous alcohol but not by fatty acids.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we investigated the role of miR-146b in the Toll-like receptor-4 signaling pathway and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced  in vivo and in vitro.The effect of miR-146b on the expression of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) in RAW264.7 cells and HepG2 was studied, and the effect of miR-146b on lipid accumulation in HepG2 was also studied in vitro. The levels of IRAK1, TRAF6, NF-κB, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the histologic features and lipid accumulation in the livers of HFD-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and an miR-146b-administered HFD mouse model, were studied in vivo.After miR-146b administration, TRAF6 and IRAK1 mRNA and protein levels in macrophages after lipopolysaccharide administration and in HepG2 cells after  (OA) administration were significantly decreased in 146b group compared with control group (P < 0.001). The lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells exposed to OA was also decreased by inactivation of IRAK1 and TRAF6, then downregulation of the downstream molecules (NF-κB) and upregulation of the tension homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) level. In vivo, after administration of miR-146b, TRAF6 and IRAK1 mRNA and protein levels as well as TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA and protein levels were decreased, and hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that the 146b group had low average adipose cell cross-sectional areas compared with control group.MiR-146b ameliorated HFD-induced  by directly suppressing IRAK1 and TRAF6.© 2015 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30948912>Ursodeoxycholic  ameliorates hepatic lipid metabolism in LO2 cells by regulating the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common chronic liver disease, can progress into nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Bile acids such as ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) play an essential role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD by regulating the level of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 1c, but the underlying regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Increased evidence indicates that the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway is a key pathway to regulate hepatic cellular lipid metabolism. UDCA may regulate the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway to ameliorate hepatic lipid metabolism.To investigate the functional mechanism of UDCA in an  (OA)-induced cellular model of NAFLD.The cellular model of NAFLD was established using OA and treated with UDCA. First, the best concentration of UDCA was selected. For the best time-dependent assay, cells were stimulated with OA only or co-treated with OA and 2 mmol/L UDCA for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Oil red O staining was used to observe the accumulation of intracellular lipids, while the intracellular contents of triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were detected by enzymatic methods. Meanwhile, the expression levels of AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway-related proteins were detected by real-time PCR and Western blot.In the NAFLD cell model established with LO2 cells induced using OA, lipid accumulation was obvious. UDCA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation at different concentrations (especially 2 mmol/L) and decreased cell growth ability at different time points. The biochemical parameters like ALT, AST, and GGT were significant improved by UDCA. UDCA treatment vividly repressed the activation of AKT, mTOR, and CRTC2 and the expression of nSREBP-1 in LO2 cells induced with OA.Our findings demonstrate the effect of UDCA in improving NAFLD. UDCA attenuates OA-induced hepatic steatosis mainly by regulation of AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signal transduction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772307>Nitro-fatty acids protect against steatosis and fibrosis during development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and resulting nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () are reaching global epidemic proportions. Lack of non-invasive diagnostic tools and effective therapies constitute two of the major hurdles for a bona fide treatment and a reversal of  progression and/or regression of the disease. Nitro- (OA-NO) has been proven effective in multiple experimental models of inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, the potential benefit of in vivo administration of OA-NO to treat advanced NAFLD was tested herein in a model of long-term  diet-induced liver damage.Non-invasive imaging (e.g. photoacustic-ultrasound (PA-US)) was pursued to establish advanced experimental model of  in mice in which both steatosis and fibrosis were diagnosed prior experimental therapy with OA-NO. Experimental controls included equimolar amounts of the non-nitrated  (OA). CLAMS and NMR-based analysis was used for energy metabolism.CLAMS and NMR-based analysis demonstrates that OA-NO improves body composition and energy metabolism and inhibits hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Photoacoustic-ultrasound imaging revealed a robust inhibition of liver steatosis and fibrosis by OA-NO. RNA-sequencing analysis uncovered inflammation and fibrosis as major pathways suppressed by OA-NO administration, as well as regulation of lipogenesis and lipolysis pathways, with a robust inhibition of SREBP1 proteolytic activation and subsequent lipogenesis gene expression by OA-NO. These results were further supported by histological analysis and quantification of lipid accumulation, lobular inflammation (F4/80 staining) and fibrosis (collagen deposition, αSMA staining) as well as established parameters of liver damage (ALT). In vitro studies indicate that OA-NO inhibits TG biosynthesis and accumulation in hepatocytes and inhibits fibrogenesis in human stellate cells.OA-NO improve steatohepatitis and fibrosis and may constitute an effective therapeutic approach against advanced NAFLD that warrants further clinical evaluation.Copyright © 2019.

Hepatic stimulator substance (HSS) has been defined as a liver-protective factor promoting hepatocyte DNA synthesis and hepatic proliferation after liver intoxication. We previously reported that HSS ameliorated hepatocyte death, probably because of its preservation of mitochondria. This study aims to explore whether HSS could protect carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1), an essential enzyme responsible for β-oxidation of free fatty acids in mitochondria, from lipotoxicity, thus alleviating hepatic lipid deposition. To test this, the HSS gene was delivered into C57BL/6J mice and efficiently expressed in the liver.  mice were prepared with high-fat diet or methionine-choline-deficient diet. The results showed that hepatic inflammation and liver functions were alleviated in the HSS-transfected mice; meanwhile, the activity of CPT-1 was obviously protected. Moreover,  (OA) treatment resulted in remarkable lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells; this deposition was improved by HSS transfection. Simultaneously, the CPT-1 activity, which was impaired by OA treatment, was profoundly rescued in the HSS-expressing cells. CPT-1 activity was more severely impaired if the OA treatment was combined with S15176, a CPT-1 inhibitor. However, this impairment was effectively reduced by the HSS transfection, and the effect was enhanced by C75, a CPT-1 activator. Interestingly, if the cells were transfected with HSS-siRNA, the preservation of CPT-1 provided by HSS was again diminished. In conclusion, HSS reduces lipotoxicity to mitochondria most likely via preservation of CPT-1.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28693358>Anti-steatosis compounds from leaves of Mallotus furetianus.</a></h1><p>There is no drug administration-approved therapy for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ().

Body weight, hepatic inflammation, steatosis, insulin sensitivity, expression of lipogenesis- and gluconeogenesis-associated genes, and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 phosphorylation were examined. The anti-steatotic effects of PTE and/or interleukin (IL)-6 were evaluated in HepG2 cells. The lipid accumulation, STAT3 phosphorylation, and expression of lipid metabolism-related genes were analyzed.PTE inhibited HFD-induced obesity and significantly attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and liver inflammation, and prevented against liver injury. PTE treatment improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, PTE treatment maintained the intact insulin signal and significantly decreased expression of gluconeogenesis-related genes in the livers of HFD-fed mice. PTE treatment strikingly enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation in the livers of HFD-fed mice. Consistent with this increase in STAT3 phosphorylation, pre-treatment of HepG2 cells with PTE enhanced IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and attenuated -induced steatosis in a STAT3-dependent manner. In contrast, PTE inhibited IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in macrophages.PTE ameliorates hepatic lipid metabolism, inflammation, and insulin resistance in mice with HFD-induced , presumably by modulating hepatic IL-6/STAT3 signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497874>Delayed intervention with a novel SGLT2 inhibitor NGI001 suppresses diet-induced metabolic dysfunction and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), is closely related to metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Despite an accumulating number of studies, no pharmacotherapy that targets NAFLD has received general approval for clinical use.Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a promising approach to treat diabetes, obesity, and associated metabolic disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, on NAFLD and obesity-associated metabolic symptoms in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.Delayed intervention with NGI001 protected against body weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia, compared with HFD alone. Adipocyte hypertrophy was prevented by administering NGI001. NGI001 inhibited impaired glucose metabolism and regulated the secretion of adipokines associated with insulin resistance. In addition, NGI001 supplementation suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, and had little impact on kidney function. In-depth investigations showed NGI001 ameliorated fat deposition and increased AMPK phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of its major downstream target, ACC, in human hepatocytes, HuS-E/2 cells. This cascade ultimately led to the downregulation of downstream fatty  synthesis-related molecules and the upregulation of downstream β oxidation-associated molecules. Surprisingly, NGI001 decreased gene and protein expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and glucose uptake in -treated HuS-E/2 cells.Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of the novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, to attenuate or delay the onset of diet-induced metabolic diseases and NAFLD.This article is protected by copyright.

We aimed to determine whether cholesterol crystallization within hepatocyte lipid droplets (LDs) distinguishes patients with fibrosing  from patients with isolated hepatic steatosis and to study pathways leading to cholesterol accumulation in hepatocyte LDs Patients with fibrosing  (n = 16) were compared to patients with isolated steatosis (n = 14). Almost all patients with fibrosing  had free cholesterol staining by filipin (16/16) and cholesterol crystals (15/16) in hepatocyte LDs, mostly in association with the LD membrane, compared to only 3/14 with cholesterol crystals and 3/14 with faint filipin staining in patients with isolated steatosis ( < 0.05). We were unable to identify significant differences in the expression of genes in liver tissue related to cholesterol homeostasis or LD proteins between patients with fibrosing  and isolated steatosis. Human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) cells were supplemented with low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and  to develop large LDs, similar to those observed in patients with . Fluorescent markers were used to track the uptake and intracellular trafficking of LDL-cholesterol. LDL-cholesterol was taken up by HepG2 cells and transported through the endosomal-lysosomal compartment directly to LDs, suggesting direct contact sites between late endosomes and LDs. Exposure of HepG2 cells to LDL-cholesterol resulted in a high concentration of cholesterol and cholesterol crystallization in LDs.  Excess cholesterol is stored in the liver primarily within hepatocyte LDs where it can crystallize. Our findings are best explained by direct transport of cholesterol from late endosomes/lysosomes to LDs in hepatocytes. We found a strong association between the presence of LD cholesterol crystals and the development of fibrosing  in humans, suggesting a causal relationship.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26461297>Oxysterols induce mitochondrial impairment and hepatocellular toxicity in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic hepatic disorder affecting up to 25% of the general population. Several intracellular events leading to NAFLD and progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () have been identified, including lipid accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Emerging evidence links both hepatic free fatty acids (FFAs) and cholesterol (FC) accumulation in NAFLD development; in particular oxysterols, the oxidative products of cholesterol, may contribute to liver injury. We performed a targeted lipidomic analysis of oxysterols in the liver of male Wistar rats fed a high-fat (HF), high-cholesterol (HC) or high-fat/high-cholesterol (HF/HC) diet. Both HF and HC diets caused liver steatosis, but the HF/HC diet resulted in steatohepatitis with associated mitochondrial dysfunction. Above all, the oxysterol cholestane-3beta,5alpha,6beta-triol (triol) was particularly increased in the liver of rats fed diets rich in cholesterol. To verify the molecular mechanism involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and hepatocellular toxicity, Huh7 and primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to palmitic  (PA) and/or  (OA), with or without triol. This compound induced apoptosis in cells co-exposed to both PA and OA, and this was associated with impaired mitochondrial respiration as well as down-regulation of PGC1-alpha, mTFA and NRF1.In conclusion, our data show that hepatic free fatty  or oxysterols accumulation per se induce low hepatocellular toxicity. On the contrary, hepatic accumulation of both fatty acids and toxic oxysterols such as triol are determinant in the impairment of mitochondrial function and biogenesis, contributing to liver pathology in NAFLD.Copyright © 2014.

Hepatic PDK4 levels were highly induced in human patients with  and MCD diet fed mice, as well as in hepatocytes treated with . The glucose and lipid metabolism were impaired in Pdk4 mice. Pdk4 deficiency ameliorated the hepatic steatosis significantly in  mice. Pdk4-MCD mice had reduced liver weights and triglyceride (TG) levels. And Pdk4 deficiency dramatically reduced the expression of genes related to fatty  uptake, synthesis and gluconeogenesis. In addition, elevated phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK), p-SAPK/JNK and diminished p-ERK, p-P38, p-Akt and p-mTOR/p-4EBP1 proteins were observed.

We aimed to investigate the role of butyrate-induced gut microbiota and metabolism in  development. Sixty-five C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups ( = 15-17 per group) and were fed either a methionine-choline-sufficient (MCS) diet or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet with or without sodium butyrate (SoB; 0.6 g/kg body weight) supplementation for 6 weeks. Liver injury, systematic inflammation, and gut barrier function were determined. Fecal microbiome and metabolome were analyzed using 16S rRNA deep sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that butyrate alleviated the MCD diet-induced microbiome dysbiosis, as evidenced by a significantly clustered configuration separate from that of the MCD group and by the depletion of  and  and enrichment of promising probiotic genera , , , , , , and  genera. The fecal metabolomic profile was also substantially improved by butyrate; several butyrate-responsive metabolites involved in lipid metabolism and other pathways, such as stearic , behenic , , linoleic , squalene, and arachidonic , were identified. Correlation analysis of the interaction matrix indicated that the modified gut microbiota and fecal metabolites induced by butyrate were strongly correlated with the alleviation of hepatic injury, fibrosis progression, inflammation, and lipid metabolism and intestinal barrier dysfunction.

In vivo, only olive oil supplementation had no detrimental effects, while HFD developed  in normal rats. Full replacement of HFD with olive oil had profoundly reversed . Noteworthily, half replacement of HFD with olive oil (a mixed diet) has ameliorated  injury as well. It strikingly changed the hepatic histology from macrovesicular-steatosis into entire microvesicular-steatosis, and significantly reduced inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis.Our study has demonstrated in both hepatocytes and  rats that  acids had great potential to combat the saturated fatty acids induced hepatic lipotoxicity. Only half replacement of HFD by monounsaturated fatty acids rich diet still had significant therapeutic outcome in  rats.

Mif(-/-) mice showed elevated liver triglyceride levels (WT, 53±14 mg/g liver; Mif(-/-), 103±7 mg/g liver; P<0.05) and a 2-3-fold increased expression of lipogenic genes. Increased fatty degeneration in the livers of Mif(-/-) mice was associated with increased hepatic inflammatory cells (1.6-fold increase in F4/80(+) macrophages) and proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., 2.3-fold increase in Tnf-α and 2-fold increase in Il-6 expression). However, inflammatory cells and cytokines were decreased by 50-90% in white adipose tissue (WAT) of Mif(-/-) mice. Subset analysis showed that macrophage phenotypes in livers of Mif(-/-) mice were skewed toward M2 (e.g., 1.7-fold and 2.5-fold increase in Arg1 and Il-13, respectively, and 2.5-fold decrease in iNos), whereas macrophages were generally reduced in WAT of these mice (70% reduction in mRNA expression of F4/80(+) macrophages). The protective MIF effect was scrutinized in isolated hepatocytes. MIF reversed inflammation-induced triglyceride accumulation in Hepa1-6 cells and primary hepatocytes and also attenuated -elicited triglyceride increase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Protection from fatty hepatocyte degeneration was paralleled by a 2- to 3-fold reduction by MIF of hepatocyte proinflammatory cytokine production. Blockade of MIF receptor cluster of differentiation 74 (CD74) but not of CXCR2 or CXCR4 fully reverted the protective effect of MIF, comparable to AMPK inhibition.

Elongation of very long chain fatty acids (ELOVL) family member 6 (Elovl6) is a microsomal enzyme that regulates the elongation of C12-16 saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (FAs). We have previously shown that Elovl6 plays an important role in the development of hepatic insulin resistance and  by modifying FA composition. Recent studies have linked altered hepatic cholesterol homeostasis and cholesterol accumulation to the pathogenesis of . In the present study, we further investigated the role of Elovl6 in the progression of lithogenic diet (LD)-induced steatohepatitis. We showed that the absence of Elovl6 suppresses hepatic lipid accumulation, plasma total cholesterol and total bile  (BA) levels in LDL receptor-deficient (Ldlr(-/-)) mice challenged with a LD. The absence of Elovl6 also decreases hepatic inflammation, oxidative stress and liver injury, but increases the formation of cholesterol crystals in the less dilated gallbladder. These findings suggest that Elovl6-mediated changes in hepatic FA composition, especially  (C18:1n-9), control handling of hepatic cholesterol and BA, which protects against hepatotoxicity and steatohepatitis, but promotes gallstone formation in LD-fed Ldlr(-/-) mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597775>RORα decreases oxidative stress through the induction of SOD2 and GPx1 expression and thereby protects against nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in mice.</a></h1><p>Increased hepatic oxidative stress and inflammation is the main cause of exacerbating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Retinoic -related orphan receptor α (RORα) regulates diverse target genes associated with lipid metabolism, and its expression level is low in the liver of patients with . Here, we investigated the role of RORα in regulating hepatic oxidative stress and inflammation.First, cholesterol sulfate (CS), an agonist of RORα, lowered oxidative stress that was induced by 1.5 mM  in the primary cultures of hepatocytes. Second, exogenously introduced RORα or CS treatment induced the mRNA level of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1), through the RORα response elements located in the upstream promoters of Sod2 and Gpx1. Third, RORα significantly decreased reactive oxygen species levels and mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin-1β that were induced by lipopolysaccharide or TNFα in Kupffer cells. Finally, the administration of JC1-40 decreased the signs of liver injury, lipid peroxidation, and inflammation in the MCD diet-induced  mice.We showed for the first time that RORα and its ligands protect  in mice by reducing hepatic oxidative stress and inflammation. Further, the molecular mechanism of the protective function of RORα against oxidative stress in the liver was revealed. These findings may offer a rationale for developing therapeutic strategies against  using RORα ligands.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28110314>Long-term exposure to a butter-rich diet induces mild-to-moderate steatosis in Chang liver cells and Swiss albino mice models.</a></h1><p>Butter is one of the widely used fats present in the diet. However, there is no satisfactory study available that evaluates the effect of a high-fat diet containing butter as the principal fat on the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).In the present study, butter was used for the development of steatosis in Chang liver cells in an in vitro study and Swiss albino mice in an in vivo study. In vitro steatosis was established, and butter was compared with  in Chang liver cells using an oil red O (ORO)-based colorimetric assay. In the in vivo study, a butter-rich special diet was fed for 15 weeks to mice, who showed no significant change in body weight. The expression pattern of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and miR-21 was compared by reverse transcriptase-PCR.Special diet-fed animals showed downregulated PTEN compared to normal diet-fed animals, while levels of miR-21 remained the same. Elevations in biochemical parameters, viz., triglycerides and liver function tests showed symptoms of onset of NAFLD. Histophathological study of livers of test animals confirmed mild-to-moderate degree of NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31043271>Hepatocellular iNOS protects liver from  through Nrf2-dependent activation of HO-1.</a></h1><p>Multiple molecular events are involved in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). There is no consensus on the role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the progression of . The present study therefore investigated the role of iNOS in  pathogenesis using bone marrow-transplanted iNOS chimeric mice under high-fat diet (HFD) conditions. The chimeric mice were fed a HFD for 16 wk, and primary hepatocytes were stimulated with  (OA). The molecular mechanisms underlying the role of iNOS in  were investigated. Marked hepatic steatosis and injury observed in the HFD mice and OA-stimulated hepatocytes were reduced by hepatocyte-derived iNOS. Mechanistically, iNOS upregulated heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) by augmenting nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) binding to the HO-1 gene promoter. In conclusion, hepatocyte-derived iNOS may play a protective role against the progression of  by upregulating HO-1 through Nrf-2. Upregulation of hepatocellular iNOS may represent a potentially new therapeutic paradigm to combat .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Caspase 8 and Fas-associated protein with death domain-like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR) is an important target gene in regulating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). At present, the effect of silibinin on CFLAR-JNK pathway related to  was unknown. Here the effect of silibinin on CFLAR-JNK pathway and its downstream target genes involved in lipid metabolism, glucose uptake, oxidative stress and inflammatory response were studied in  (OA)-treated HepG2 cells.OA-treated HepG2 cells were employed as a in vitro model of steatosis, insulin resistance and oxidative stress. The model cells were then treated by silibinin (5, 20, 50, and 100 μM) for 24 h and detected for the related indicators as follows: (1) cellular triglycerides (TG), nitric oxide (NO) and glucose uptake; (2) the mRNA levels of the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1C (SREBP-1C), patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPARα); (3) the protein levels of PPARα, SREBP-1C, PNPLA3, CFLAR, phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (pJNK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated serine-threonine protein kinase (pAKT), nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and 4A (CYP4A).Compared to the control, OA-treatment led to a result as follows: (1) increased the intracellular levels of TG and NO; (2) up-regulated the protein expression of SREBP-1C, PNPLA3, pJNK, CYP 2E1 and CYP 4A; (3) decreased the uptake of 2-NBDG; (4) down-regulated the protein expression of CFLAR, PPARα, PI3K, pAKT and NRF2. Compared to OA-treated HepG2 cells, silibinin treatment could improve the indicators as follows: (1) decreased the intracellular levels of TG and NO; (2) down-regulated the protein expression of SREBP-1C, PNPLA3, pJNK, CYP 2E1 and CYP 4A; (3) increased the uptake of 2-NBDG; (4) up-regulated the protein expression of CFLAR, PPARα, PI3K, pAKT and NRF2.Silibinin can ameliorate some metabolic alterations and induce some molecular changes by activating the CFLAR-JNK pathway and thereby regulating its downstream target genes involved in lipid metabolism (PPARα, SREBP-1C and PNPLA3), glucose uptake (PI3K-AKT), oxidative stress (NRF2, CYP2E1, CYP4A) and inflammatory response(NO) in OA-treated HepG2 cells demonstrating its possible use in ameliorating various symptoms of .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Between February 2014 and February 2015, 105 cases of NAFLD were recruited and confirmed by liver biopsy pathology, including patients with mild NAFLD (n=58) and moderate-severe NAFLD (n=47); nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () (n=53) and non- (n=52); and 50 healthy participants were regarded as the healthy control group. MiR-9 expression was measured by qRT-PCR. For in vitro experiments, L-02 normal liver cells were divided into normal control group (cultured with original culture medium), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) group (cultured with DMSO) and  group (cultured with  to induce fatty change), and MTT assay was used to measure the effect of different  concentrations on cell proliferation. Nile red staining was used to detect intracellular accumulation of lipid droplets. Further, synthetic miR-9 mimic and its control and miR-9 inhibitors and its control were independently transfected into L-02 cells. RESULTS MiR-9 levels in the mild NAFLD group and moderate-severe NAFLD group were significantly higher than in the healthy control group (both P<0.05). Mean fluorescence intensity of lipid droplets increased with the duration of induction, and were dramatically higher in oleate-treated L-02 cells; intracellular triglyceride (TG) content was also higher. miR-9 levels significantly increased following oleate induction. Importantly, miR-9 levels were significantly elevated upon miR-9 mimic transfection. Conversely, miR-9 level was lowered with miR-9 inhibitors transfection. Additionally, Onecut2 and SIRT1 were identified as miR-9 targets. CONCLUSIONS A positive relationship between miR-9 and steatosis was established with our results that miR-9 mimic transfection decreased intracellular lipid content. Finally, we identified 2 miR-9 targets, Onecut2 and SIRT1, which may be crucial players in NAFLD development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659956>Osthole inhibits /lipopolysaccharide-induced lipid accumulation and inflammatory response through activating PPARα signaling pathway in cultured hepatocytes.</a></h1><p>Osthole, a coumarin derivative, can increase hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) expression and reduce hepatic steatosis and inflammatory response in rats with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). In this study, a cell model of  was induced with  (OA)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and treated for 36 h with different osthole concentrations. Results showed that intracellular lipid and inflammatory cytokine levels gradually decreased after osthole treatment. These effects, however, were abolished or attenuated after PPARα gene silencing. Accordingly, PPARα gene silencing reversed the osthole-mediated expressions of proteins involved in lipid synthesis and fatty  oxidation. PPARα gene silencing also abrogated the inhibitory effect of osthole on nuclear factor kappa B p65 protein expression. These findings demonstrate that osthole activates PPARα signaling pathway to inhibit lipid accumulation and inflammatory response in OA/LPS-stimulated hepatocytes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The experimental models included mice fed a high-fat diet combined or not with fructose (HFD+F) and HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells treated with the lipogenic agents palmitate, oleate or fructose. CYP4F2 protein, a cytochrome P-450 isoform with proposed α-tocopherol ω-hydroxylase activity, decreased in HFD and even more in HFD+F mice liver; this finding was associated with increased hepatic levels of α-tocopherol and decreased formation of the corresponding long-chain metabolites α-13-hydroxy and α-13-carboxy chromanols. A decreased expression was also observed for PPAR-γ and SREBP-1 proteins, two vitamin E-responsive genes with key role in lipid metabolism and CYP4F2 gene regulation. A transient activation of CYP4F2 gene followed by a repression response was observed in HepG2 cells during the exposure to increasing levels of the lipogenic and cytotoxic agent palmitic ; such gene repression effect was further exacerbated by the co-treatment with  and α-tocopherol and was also observed for PPAR-γ and the SREBP isoforms 1 and 2. Such gene response was associated with increased uptake and ω-hydroxylation of α-tocopherol, which suggests a minor role of CYP4F2 in the enzymatic metabolism of vitamin E in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, the liver metabolism and gene response of α-tocopherol are impaired in experimental NAFLD.Copyright © 2017.

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a pattern recognition receptor whose activation results in the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. It has been reported that TLR4 is upregulated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of . This study aimed to examine the changes of TLR4 and its signaling pathways in sophocarpine's anti-inflammatory process on experimental  in vitro.Primary hepatocytes were isolated, and -induced steatosis model was established. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to detect the number of metabolically active mitochondria and viable cells. Immunocytochemistry analysis was applied to evaluating pro-inflammatory cytokines synthesis. Total RNA and protein were extracted for real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot detection.Enhanced expression of TLR4 was observed in -induced steatotic hepatocytes. Sophocarpine suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines synthesis and reduced the expression of TLR4 in steatotic hepatocytes. Expression of TLR4 and pro-inflammatory cytokines recovered after sophocarpine was removed. Moreover, sophocarpine restrained the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), and Extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) signaling pathways in the anti-inflammatory process.Sophocarpine could decrease the expression of TLR4 in steatotic hepatocytes and suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines synthesis. NF-κB, JNK, and ERK signaling pathways were important workable downstream pathways.© 2014 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.</p></html>
