As determined by dynamic time-lapse tracking studies, the local accumulation of neutrophils with high migration speeds after wounding (n=33 cells, v=0.020 μm/s, d=37.8 μm), underwent significant reduction following treatment with EGCG doses of 300 μM (n=22 cells, v=0.013 μm/s, d=39.5 μm) and 600 μM (n=18 cells, v=0.008 μm/s, d=9.53 μm). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction studies revealed that several signature genes in the IL-1β, TNFα, and related signaling pathways were downregulated after EGCG treatment.The convenience, transparency, and simplicity of the zebrafish model facilitate tracking of fluorescent neutrophils in real time, in order to monitor inflammation, and assess the impact of therapeutic agents.© 2019 Nguyen et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696186>Flaxseed oil supplementation improves intestinal function and , associated with altered intestinal microbiome and fatty acid profile in pigs with intrauterine growth retardation.</a></h1><p>Flaxseed oil (FO), enriched in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), is an important oil source for intestinal development and health. We aimed to study the different effects of FO versus soybean oil (SO) on growth, intestinal health and immune function of neonates with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) using a weaned piglet model. Forty pairs of male IUGR and normal birth weight piglets, weaned at 21 ± 1 d, were fed diets containing either 4% FO or SO for 3 weeks consecutively. Growth performance, nutrient digestibility and intestinal function parameters, immunology and microbiota composition were determined. IUGR led to a poor growth rate, nutrient digestibility and abnormal immunology variables, whereas feeding FO diet improved systemic and gut , as indicated by increased plasma concentration of immunoglobulin G and decreased CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes, and down-regulated intestinal expression of genes (MyD88, NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-10). Although IUGR tended to decrease villous height, feeding FO diet tended to increase the villi-crypt ratio and up-regulated expressions of tight junction genes (Claudin-1 and ZO-1), together with increased mucosa contents of n-3 PUFAs and a lower Σn-6/Σn-3 ratio. Besides, FO diet decreased the abundance of pathogenic bacteria Spirochaetes, and increased phylum Actinobacteria, and genera Blautia and Bifidobacterium in colonic digesta. Our findings indicate that IUGR impairs growth rate, nutrient digestibility, and partly immunology variables, whereas feeding FO-supplemented diet could improve intestinal function and  of both IUGR and NBW pigs, associated with the altered gut microbiome and mucosal fatty acid profile.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695699>Misunderstandings Between Platelets and Neutrophils Build in Chronic Inflammation.</a></h1><p>Regulated hemostasis, inflammation and innate  entail extensive interactions between platelets and neutrophils. Under physiological conditions, vascular inflammation offers a template for the establishment of effective intravascular , with platelets providing neutrophils with an array of signals that increase their activation threshold, thus limiting collateral damage to tissues and promoting termination of the inflammatory response. By contrast, persistent systemic inflammation as observed in immune-mediated diseases, such as systemic vasculitides, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by platelet and neutrophil reciprocal activation, which ultimately culminates in the generation of thrombo-inflammatory lesions, fostering vascular injury and organ damage. Here, we discuss recent evidence regarding the multifaceted aspects of platelet-neutrophil interactions from bone marrow precursors to shed microparticles. Moreover, we analyse shared and disease-specific events due to an aberrant deployment of these interactions in human diseases. To restore communications between the pillars of the immune-hemostatic continuum constitutes a fascinating challenge for the near future.Copyright © 2019 Ramirez, Manfredi and Maugeri.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696392>Fingolimod Immune Effects Beyond Its Sequestration Ability.</a></h1><p>Fingolimod is the first orally administered drug approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). This drug, modulating sphingosine receptors, regulates the trafficking of lymphocytes between primary and secondary lymphoid organs, trapping naïve T cells and central memory T cells in secondary lymphoid organs, without affecting effector memory T cells and therefore without compromising immunosurveillance. Additionally, fingolimod inhibits expression of Th1 and Th17 cytokines and enhances regulatory T-cell differentiation. It also acts on the B arm of  through an increased ratio of naïve to memory B cells, higher percentage of plasma cells, and highly increased proportion of transitional B cells as well as additional regulatory subsets. Fingolimod treatment enhances the capacity of regulatory B cells to transmigrate across brain endothelial cells. In fact, patients treated with fingolimod have increased regulatory B-cell frequency in the cerebrospinal fluid. These findings suggest a novel role for fingolimod in MS, by both direct effects and indirect partitioning effects on lymphocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695116>Protective effects of seaweed supplemented diet on antioxidant and immune responses in European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) subjected to bacterial infection.</a></h1><p>European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) production is often hampered by bacterial infections such as photobacteriosis caused by Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp). Since diet can impact fish , this work investigated the effect of dietary supplementation of 5% Gracilaria sp. aqueous extract (GRA) on seabass antioxidant capacity and resistance against Phdp. After infection, mortality was delayed in fish fed GRA, which also revealed increased lysozyme activity levels, as well as decreased lipid peroxidation, suggesting higher antioxidant capacity than in fish fed a control diet. Dietary GRA induced a down-regulation of hepatic stress-responsive heat shock proteins (grp-78, grp-170, grp-94, grp-75), while bacterial infection caused a down-regulation in antioxidant genes (prdx4 and mn-sod). Diet and infection interaction down-regulated the transcription levels of genes associated with oxidative stress response (prdx5 and gpx4) in liver. In head-kidney, GRA led to an up-regulation of genes associated with inflammation (il34, ccr9, cd33) and a down-regulation of genes related to cytokine signalling (mif, il1b, defb, a2m, myd88). Additionally, bacterial infection up-regulated immunoglobulins production (IgMs) and down-regulated the transcription of the antimicrobial peptide leap2 in head kidney. Overall, we found that GRA supplementation modulated seabass resistance to Phdp infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696230>Expression profiling in exercised mdx suggests a role for extracellular proteins in the dystrophic muscle immune response.</a></h1><p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal muscle wasting disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene that lead to the absence or severe reduction of dystrophin protein in muscle. The mdx mouse, also dystrophin deficient, is the model most widely used to study the pathology and test potential therapies, but the phenotype is milder than human DMD. This limits the magnitude and range of histological damage parameters and molecular changes that can be measured in pre-clinical drug testing. We used three weeks of voluntary wheel running to exacerbate the mdx phenotype. In mdx mice voluntary exercise increased the amount of damaged necrotic tissue and macrophage infiltration. Global gene expression profiling revealed that exercise induced additional and larger gene expression changes in mdx mice and the pathways most impacted by exercise were all related to immune function or cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. When we compared the matrisome and inflammation genes that were dysregulated in mdx with those commonly differentially expressed in DMD, we found the exercised mdx molecular signature more closely resembled that of DMD. These gene expression changes in the exercised mdx model thus provide more scope to assess the effects of pre-clinical treatments. Our gene profiling comparisons also highlighted upregulation of extracellular matrix proteins involved in innate  pathways, proteases that can release them, and downstream receptors and signalling molecules in exercised mdx and DMD, suggesting that the ECM could be a major source of pro-inflammatory molecules that trigger and maintain the immune response in dystrophic muscle.© The Author(s) 2019.

The research was carried out on 28 cows with clinical endometritis. Animals were divided into four groups, each composed of seven cows, depending on the i.u. preparation used: Group A, cefapirin; Group B, methisoprinol; Group C, cefapirin and methisoprinol simultaneously; and a control group-without medication. The study was performed using flow cytometry method. Summarizing the results of the research, i.u. infusion of cefapirin caused a weakening of the effector phase of the local uterine immune response; however, it enhanced leukocyte chemotaxis and antigen presentation. After i.u. administration of methisoprinol, the stimulation of specific uterine  mechanisms was mainly observed. The use of both mentioned preparations showed the strengthening of specific uterine immunological mechanisms presumably caused by methisoprinol, despite the inhibitory effect of the antibiotic. Intrauterine use of immunostimulatory substances can improve the effectiveness of the endometritis treatment in cows by improving specific local mechanisms of uterine . As a consequence, it may enhance the effector function of immune competent cells and finally eliminate inflammation.© 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695701>Antigen Sampling -Expressing Epithelial Cells Are the Functional Equivalents of Mammalian M Cells in the Avian Follicle-Associated Epithelium.</a></h1><p>The follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) is a specialized structure that samples luminal antigens and transports them into mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT). In mammals, transcytosis of antigens across the gut epithelium is performed by a subset of FAE cells known as M cells. Here we show that colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) is expressed by a subset of cells in the avian bursa of Fabricius FAE. Expression was initially detected using a -reporter transgene that also label subsets of bursal macrophages. Immunohistochemical detection using a specific monoclonal antibody confirmed abundant expression of CSF1R on the basolateral membrane of FAE cells. -transgene expressing bursal FAE cells were enriched for expression of markers previously reported as putative M cell markers, including annexin A10 and CD44. They were further distinguished from a population of -transgene negative epithelial cells within FAE by high apical F-actin expression and differential staining with the lectins jacalin, PHA-L and SNA. Bursal FAE cells that express the -reporter transgene were responsible for the bulk of FAE transcytosis of labeled microparticles in the size range 0.02-0.1 μm. Unlike mammalian M cells, they did not readily take up larger bacterial sized microparticles (0.5 μm). Their role in uptake of bacteria was tested using , which can enter via M cells in mammals. Labeled  serovar Typhimurium entered bursal tissue via the FAE. Entry was partially dependent upon Type III secretion system-1. However, the majority of invading bacteria were localized to -negative FAE cells and in resident phagocytes that express the phosphatidylserine receptor TIM4. -expressing FAE cells in infected follicles showed evidence of cell death and shedding into the bursal lumen. In mammals, CSF1R expression in the gut is restricted to macrophages which only indirectly control M cell differentiation. The novel expression of CSF1R in birds suggests that these functional equivalents to mammalian M cells may have different ontological origins and their development and function are likely to be regulated by different growth factors.Copyright © 2019 Balic, Chintoan-Uta, Vohra, Sutton, Cassady-Cain, Hu, Donaldson, Stevens, Mabbott, Hume, Sang and Vervelde.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694973>Bacterial load of  in the posterior oropharynx, tonsillar fossae and saliva among gay and bisexual men with untreated oropharyngeal chlamydia.</a></h1><p> The aim of this study was to determine whether  (CT) could be detected in saliva and if infection is specific to an anatomical site in the oropharynx. Men who have sex with men (MSM) who were diagnosed with oropharyngeal chlamydia at Melbourne Sexual Health Centre in 2017-2018 were invited to participate upon returning for treatment. Swabs at the tonsillar fossae, posterior oropharynx, and a saliva sample were collected. Throat samples were tested for CT by Aptima Combo 2 assay. The bacterial loads of CT in all samples were assessed by qPCR detecting the  gene. We calculated the positivity and bacterial load of CT for all samples. Forty-two MSM were included. Median age was 28 (interquartile range [IQR]:24-33). 32 participants (76.2%; 95%CI:60.5% to 87.9%) had CT detected by qPCR at both the tonsillar fossae and the posterior oropharynx, followed by 9.5% (n=4; 95%CI:2.7% to 22.6%) positive at the posterior oropharynx only, and 4.8% (n=2; 95%CI:0.58% to 16.2%) positive at the tonsillar fossae only. Twenty-nine MSM had CT detected in saliva (69.0%; 95%CI:52.9% to 82.3%). The median CT load in saliva was 446 copies/ml (IQR:204-1,390), in the tonsillar fossae was 893 copies/swab (IQR:390-13,224), and in posterior oropharynx was 1,204 copies/swab (IQR:330-16,211). There was no significant difference in CT load between the tonsillar fossae and the posterior oropharynx (p=0.119). Among MSM with oropharyngeal chlamydia nearly three quarters had chlamydia DNA detected in saliva, although the viability and implications for transmission are unknown.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695851>Graphene quantum dots rescue protein dysregulation of pancreatic β-cells exposed to human islet amyloid polypeptide.</a></h1><p>The amyloid aggregation of peptides and proteins is a hallmark of neurological disorders and type 2 diabetes. Human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), co-secreted with insulin by pancreatic β-cells, plays dual roles in both glycemic control and the pathology of type 2 diabetes. While IAPP can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and modulate cellular autophagy, apoptosis and extracellular matrix metabolism, no data is available concerning intracellular protein expression upon exposure to the polypeptide. More surprisingly, how intracellular protein expression is modulated by nanoparticle inhibitors of protein aggregation remains entirely unknown. In this study, we first examined the changing proteomes of βTC6, a pancreatic β-cell line, upon exposure to monomeric, oligomeric and fibrillar IAPP, and detailed cellular protein expression rescued by graphene quantum dots (GQDs), an IAPP inhibitor. We found that 29 proteins were significantly dysregulated by the IAPP species, while majority of these proteins were nucleotide-binding proteins. Collectively, our liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry, fluorescence quenching, helium ion microscopy, cytotoxicity and discreet molecular dynamics simulations data revealed a remarkable capacity of GQDs in regulating aberrant protein expression through H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions, pointing to nanomedicine as a new frontier against human amyloid diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695677>Combination Thyroid Hormone Replacement; Knowns and Unknowns.</a></h1><p>Hypothyroidism is common throughout the world and readily diagnosed with thyroid function tests. Management should be straightforward but appears not to be the case. Thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine monotherapy is the standard treatment which is effective in the majority of cases. However, 10-15% of patients established on levothyroxine do not feel their health is entirely restored and some patients prefer the addition of liothyronine. Proponents of liothyronine argue that the ratio of T3 and T4 hormones is substantially altered on T4 monotherapy and therefore both hormones may be needed for optimal health. This remains controversial as clinical trials have not demonstrated superiority of combination therapy (levothyroxine and liothyronine) over levothyroxine monotherapy. There is now a pressing need for further studies and in particular randomized controlled trials in this area. To help design and facilitate dedicated trials and better understand thyroid hormone replacement, this review summarizes the evidence where there is established knowledge and agreement (knowns) and areas where research is lacking (unknowns). Agreements include the extent of dissatisfaction with levothyroxine monotherapy, biases in testing for hypothyroidism and prescribing levothyroxine, as well as variable thresholds for prescribing levothyroxine and challenges in liothyronine dosing. The review will also highlight and summarize the unknowns including the long-term safety profile of liothyronine, and potential biomarkers to identify individuals who might benefit most from combination therapy.Copyright © 2019 Taylor, Eligar, Muller, Scholz, Dayan and Okosieme.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696443>Effect of azadirachtin on mortality and immune response of leaf-cutting ants.</a></h1><p>Leaf-cutting ants are difficult pests to control because they have numerous defense strategies and are highly selective in their plant harvesting choices. The search for effective pest control methods that have minimal negative effects on the environment has been continuous. Azadirachtin, a compound extracted from the neem tree (Azadirachta indica), is a promising alternative for the control of various pests, as it is toxic to some insects but readily degrades in the environment. In this study, we evaluated the effects of azadirachtin on the mortality, through topical exposure to the compound, and immune response, by introducing an artificial antigen into leaf-cutting ants Atta sexdens and Acromyrmex subterraneus subterraneus. Azadirachtin caused death to minor and major workers of both species in a concentration-dependent manner. Topical application of the compound did not diminish the immune response of ants in a microfilament encapsulation assay. Azadirachtin showed no effect on the immune response of workers but increased worker mortality, which indicates its potential as an ant control agent.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695411>PD-1 inhibitors dependent CD8 T cells inhibit mouse colon cancer cell metastasis.</a></h1><p>Colon cancer is a common digestive tract malignancy which ranks as the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. A current focus of anti-cancer research is harnessing the patient's own immune system for therapy. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), an immune suppressor, is upregulated in various activated immune cells, such as T cells, and in viral infections and tumors.The objective of this study was to investigate the function of PD-1 inhibitor on the metastasisi of mouse colon cancer cells.In the present study, we established an in situ colon cancer mouse model using the CT26 cell line. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was performed to detect colon cancer cell metastasis. The levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-12 (IL-12) in serum and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were detected by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). CD44 CD62L memory T cells, CD4 FoxP3 regulatory T cells, and IFN-γ and TNF-α levels in MLNs and spleen were detected by flow cytometry (FCM).We found that anti-PD-1 therapy inhibited colon cancer cells metastasis to the small intestine, liver, and lung, and lengthened the survival time of mice. However, the depletion of CD8 suppressed the activity of anti-PD-1 antibodies. In response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, the levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-12 (IL-12) in serum and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were significantly increased, while IL-6, IL-17, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) were decreased. CD8 depletion had the opposite effect. In addition, anti-PD-1 treatment significantly increased CD44 CD62L memory T cells, decreased CD4 FoxP3 regulatory T cells, and increased IFN-γ and TNF-α levels in MLNs and spleen. Furthermore, anti-PD-1 treatment cannot exert these roles when CD8 is depleted.These results suggest that PD-1 inhibitors rely on CD8+ T cells to exert anti-tumor  in colon cancer.© 2019 Gao et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695799>STING activation in cancer immunotherapy.</a></h1><p>Cancer immunotherapy modulates and leverages the host immune system to treat cancer. The past decade has witnessed historical advancement of cancer immunotherapy. A myriad of approaches have been explored to elicit or augment anticancer innate  and/or adaptive . Recently, activation of stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING), an intracellular receptor residing in the endoplasmic reticulum, has shown great potential to enhance antitumor  through the induction of a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including type I IFNs. A number of natural and synthetic STING agonists have been discovered or developed, and tested in preclinical models and in the clinic for the immunotherapy of diseases such as cancer and infectious diseases. Cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), such as cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), cyclic dimeric adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP), and cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), are a class of STING agonists that can elicit immune responses. However, natural CDNs are hydrophilic small molecules with negative charges and are susceptible to enzymatic degradation, leading to low bioavailability in target tissues yet unwanted toxicities and narrow therapeutic windows. Drug delivery systems, coupled with nucleic acid chemistry, have been exploited to address these challenges. Here, we will discuss the underlying immunological mechanisms and approaches to STING activation, with a focus on the delivery of STING agonists, for cancer immunotherapy.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695574>Using Multiple Scale Spatio-Temporal Patterns for Validating Spatially Explicit Agent-Based Models.</a></h1><p>Spatially explicit agent-based models (ABMs) have been widely utilized to simulate the dynamics of spatial processes that involve the interactions of individual agents. The assumptions embedded in the ABMs may be responsible for uncertainty in the model outcomes. To ensure the reliability of the outcomes in terms of their space-time patterns, model validation should be performed. In this paper, we propose the use of multiple scale spatio-temporal patterns for validating spatially explicit ABMs. We evaluated several specifications of vector-borne disease transmission models by comparing space-time patterns of model outcomes to observations at multiple scales via the sum of root mean square error (RMSE) measurement. The results indicate that specifications of the spatial configurations of residential area and  status of individual humans are of importance to reproduce observed patterns of dengue outbreaks at multiple space-time scales. Our approach to using multiple scale spatio-temporal patterns can help not only to understand the dynamic associations between model specifications and model outcomes, but also to validate spatially explicit ABMs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694938>Engineering Newcastle disease virus as oncolytic vector for intratumoral delivery of immune checkpoint inhibitors and immunocytokines.</a></h1><p>Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) is an attractive candidate for oncolytic immunotherapy due to its ability to replicate in tumor cells and potentially overcome the inherently immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment. The advent of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy over the past few years represents a paradigm shift in cancer therapy. However, the prevalence of severe immune-related adverse events with CTLA-4 and PD1 pathway blockade in clinical studies especially in combination therapy groups, is a cause for concern. Immunotherapies with cytokines have also been extensively explored but they have been associated with adverse events in clinical trials. Oncolytic vectors engineered to express checkpoint blockade antibodies and cytokines could provide an avenue for reducing the clinical toxicity associated with systemic therapy by concentrating the immunomodulatory payload at the site of disease. In this study, we engineered six different recombinant viruses, NDVs expressing checkpoint inhibitors (rNDV-anti-PD1 and rNDV-anti-PDL1), superagonists (rNDV-anti-CD28) and immunocytokines, where these antibodies are fused to an immunostimulatory cytokine such as IL12 (rNDV-anti-CD28-mIL12, rNDV-anti-PD1-mIL12 and rNDV-anti-PDL1-mIL12). These six engineered viruses induced tumor control and survival benefit both in a highly aggressive unilateral and bilateral B16-F10 murine melanoma model, indicative of an abscopal effect. The data represent a strong proof-of-concept, on which further clinical evaluation could build. Checkpoint inhibitor therapy has shown tremendous efficacy but also frequent and often severe side effects-especially when multiple drugs of this class are used simultaneously. Similarly, many investigational immunotherapy agents, which have shown promise in animal models, have failed in clinical trials due to dose-limiting toxicity when administered systemically. This study utilized a murine melanoma model to evaluate the efficacy of intratumoral injections of recombinant NDVs engineered to express multiple immunotherapeutic proteins with well-documented side effects in humans. Our results indicate that intratumoral administration of these recombinant NDVs, particularly when combined with systemic CTLA4 checkpoint inhibition, exerts a robust effect in treated and non-treated tumors indicative of a systemic anti-tumoral response. The intratumoral delivery of rNDVs expressing immunotherapeutic proteins may be an effective method of targeting immune cell populations most relevant for anti-tumoral  and allowing to restrict the use of systemic immunotherapy agents.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695359>An Oral Whole-Cell Killed Nontypeable  Immunotherapeutic For The Prevention Of Acute Exacerbations Of Chronic Airway Disease.</a></h1><p>In subjects with chronic bronchitis, protection against acute bronchitis following oral administration of a whole-cell killed nontypeable  (NTHi) preparation was demonstrated in the mid-1980s. Subsequently, studies aiming to validate clinical efficacy of this oral treatment were complicated by a number of factors, including the modification of clinical definitions, the implications of which were not recognized at that time. The objective of this review is to integrate our pre-clinical and clinical research in this field conducted over the past 30 years to demonstrate the evolution of the idea of communication between mucosal surfaces through the common mucosal immune system and the development of an effective oral NTHi immunotherapy. Our earliest studies recruited subjects with chronic sputum production and high levels of culture-positive sputum for Gram-negative bacteria but by 2000, the clinical diagnostic focus had switched from "chronic bronchitis" to "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease" (COPD), which was functionally defined using spirometry. This change led to variable clinical trial results, confirming the importance of chronic sputum production and culture-positive sputum. Additional conditioning factors such as patient age and gender were influential in study populations with low culture-positive sputum production. Through this period, studies in human and in rodent models provided new insights into airway protection mechanisms and the pathogenesis of airway inflammation. Key findings were the importance of a dysbiosis within the airway microbiome, and the critical role of an interdependence between the bronchus and the gut, with a Peyer's patch-dependent extra-bronchus "loop" controlling the composition of the bronchus microbiome. Within this context, intercurrent virus infections initiate a microbiome-dependant hypersensitivity reaction involving Peyer's patch-derived Th17 cells. We conclude that whole-cell killed NTHi immunotherapy has consistent and significant benefits when examined in the context of changing clinical disease definitions, age and gender, and has the potential to change the natural history of chronic airway disease.© 2019 Clancy and Cripps.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695037>Synergistic cancer immunotherapy combines MVA-CD40L induced innate and adaptive  with tumor targeting antibodies.</a></h1><p>Virus-based vaccines and appropriate costimulation potently enhance antigen-specific T cell  against cancer.

Therapeutic treatment with rMVA-CD40L-expressing tumor-associated antigens results in the control of established tumors.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi produce chitooligosaccharides (COs) and lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs), that promote symbiosis signalling with resultant oscillations in nuclear-associated calcium. The activation of symbiosis signalling must be balanced with activation of  signalling, which in fungal interactions is promoted by COs resulting from the chitinaceous fungal cell wall. Here we demonstrate that COs ranging from CO4-CO8 can induce symbiosis signalling in Medicago truncatula. CO perception is a function of the receptor-like kinases MtCERK1 and LYR4, that activate both  and symbiosis signalling. A combination of LCOs and COs act synergistically to enhance symbiosis signalling and suppress  signalling and receptors involved in both CO and LCO perception are necessary for mycorrhizal establishment. We conclude that LCOs, when present in a mix with COs, drive a symbiotic outcome and this mix of signals is essential for arbuscular mycorrhizal establishment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696060>Epstein-Barr Virus BART Long Non-coding RNAs Function as Epigenetic Modulators in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) establishes lifelong latent infection in humans and is associated with several lymphoid and epithelial cancers. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), EBV expresses few viral proteins but elevated levels of HI A rightward transcripts (BARTs) RNA, which includes viral microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). BART lncRNAs localize within the nucleus of EBV-infected cells and knockdown of BART lncRNAs significantly affects the expression of genes associated with cell adhesion, oxidoreductase activity, inflammation, and . Notably, downregulation of  family zinc finger 3 (Aiolos), which plays a role in lymphocyte development and cell attachment, occurred in NPC C666-1 cells following BART lncRNA-knockdown. Since Aiolos expression is normally restricted to lymphoid cells and rarely observed in epithelial cells, induction of Aiolos by BART lncRNA was confirmed by expressing the major BART lncRNA isoform, , in EBV-positive and -negative cells. BART lncRNA associated with the CBP/p300 complex and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in the nucleus, suggesting that BART lncRNAs may mediate epigenetic regulation of gene expression through interaction with the chromatin remodeling machinery. This contention is further supported by evidence that BART lncRNA appears to stall Pol II at the promoter region and may regulate  and  expression by inhibiting transcription by Pol II in NPC. We hypothesize that EBV BART lncRNA expression modulates host gene expression and maintains EBV latency by interfering with histone methylation and acetylation processes. Aberrant expression of affected host genes mediated by BART lncRNA may lead to immune evasion, progression, and metastasis of NPC.Copyright © 2019 Verhoeven, Tong, Mok, Liu, He, Zong, Chen, Tsao, Lung and Chen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695150>Smart cancer nanomedicine.</a></h1><p>Nanomedicines are extensively employed in cancer therapy.

Opportunistic choices based on drug availability should be replaced by investments in modular (pro)drug and nanocarrier design. (3) Combination therapies are the mainstay of clinical cancer care. Nanomedicines synergize with pharmacological and physical co-treatments, and should be increasingly integrated in multimodal combination therapy regimens. (4) Immunotherapy is revolutionizing the treatment of cancer. Nanomedicines can modulate the behaviour of myeloid and lymphoid cells, thereby empowering anticancer  and immunotherapy efficacy. Alone and especially together, these four directions will fuel and foster the development of successful cancer nanomedicine therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695581>A preliminary Study on the Effect of Head and Neck Chemoradiotherapy on Systematic .</a></h1><p>This study was designed initially to explore the effect of chemoradiotherapy on patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer (HNC) with respect to the alteration of systematic .We did a retrospective study enrolling patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), with or without induction chemotherapy (IC). Blood tests were performed before IC, before and after CCRT. Flow cytometric analysis and turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay were used for detection.A total number of 58 patients were included from April 1, 2018, to March 31, 2019. Levels of immunoglobulins (Ig), including IgA, IgG, and IgM, declined after 2 to 3 cycles of IC and CCRT, respectively. Serum level of total hemolytic complement (CH50) increased ( < .001) after IC, but kept stably post-CCRT. Natural killer (NK) cells decreased ( < .01) after IC and enhanced ( < .001) post-CCRT. The number of CD3CD4 T cells got increased ( < .01) after IC and decreased ( < .001) post-CCRT. Consistently, both IC and CCRT induced the increase in CD3CD8 T cells significantly ( < .001 vs  < .01).Both radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy (CT) induced dual effect of immune response. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy created an active immune response based on the effect induced by IC, suggesting that RT exerted a potential function on mobilizing immune system.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696664>Nanotechnology platforms for cancer immunotherapy.</a></h1><p>Various cancer therapies have advanced remarkably over the past decade. Unlike the direct therapeutic targeting of tumor cells, cancer immunotherapy is a new strategy that boosts the host's immune system to detect specific cancer cells for efficient elimination. Nanoparticles incorporating immunomodulatory agents can activate immune cells and modulate the tumor microenvironment to enhance antitumor . Such nanoparticle-based cancer immunotherapies have received considerable attention and have been extensively studied in recent years. This review thus focuses on nanoparticle-based platforms (especially naturally derived nanoparticles and synthetic nanoparticles) utilized in recent advances; summarizes delivery systems that incorporate various immune-modulating agents, including peptides and nucleic acids, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and other small immunostimulating agents; and introduces combinational cancer immunotherapy with nanoparticles, especially nanoparticle-based photo-immunotherapy and nanoparticle-based chemo-immunotherapy. Undoubtedly, the recent studies introduced in this review prove that nanoparticle-incorporated cancer immunotherapy is a highly promising treatment modality for patients with cancer. Nonetheless further research is needed to solve safety concerns and improve efficacy of nanoplatform-based cancer immunotherapy for future clinical application.

Although chronic inflammation has been described as one of the hallmarks of cancer, acute inflammation can actually trigger the immune system to fight diseases, including cancer. Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands have long been used as adjuvants for traditional vaccines and it seems they may also play a role enhancing efficiency of tumor immunotherapy. The aim of this perspective is to discuss the effects of TLR stimulation in cancer, expression of various TLRs in different types of tumors, and finally the role of TLRs in anti-cancer  and tumor rejection.Copyright © 2019 Urban-Wojciuk, Khan, Oyler, Fåhraeus, Marek-Trzonkowska, Nita-Lazar, Hupp and Goodlett.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695097>Expansion, isolation and first characterization of bovine Th17 lymphocytes.</a></h1><p>Interleukin 17A-producing T helper cells (Th17) are CD4+ T cells that are crucial to  to extracellular bacteria. The roles of these cells in the bovine species are poorly defined, because the characterization of bovine Th17 cells lags behind for want of straightforward cultivation and isolation procedures. We have developed procedures to differentiate, expand, and isolate bovine Th17 cells from circulating CD4+ T cells of adult cows. Using polyclonal stimulation with antibodies to CD3 and CD28, we expanded IL-17A-positive CD4+ T cells in a serum-free cell culture medium supplemented with TGF-β1, IL-6 and IL-2. Populations of CD4+ T cells producing IL-17A or IFN-γ or both cytokines were obtained. Isolation of IL-17A-secreting CD4+ T cells was performed by labelling surface IL-17A, followed by flow cytometry cell sorting. The sorted Th17 cells were restimulated and could be expanded for several weeks. These cells were further characterized by cytokine profiling at transcriptomic and protein levels. They produced high amounts of IL-17A and IL-17F, and moderate amounts of IL-22 and IFN-γ. The techniques developed will be useful to characterize the phenotypic and functional properties of bovine Th17 cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695690>Characterization of cxorf21 Provides Molecular Insight Into Female-Bias Immune Response in SLE Pathogenesis.</a></h1><p> Ninety percent of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients are women. X chromosome-dosage increases susceptibility to SLE and primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). Chromosome X open reading frame 21  escapes X-inactivation and is an SLE risk gene of previously unknown function. We undertook the present study to delineate the function of CXorf21 in the immune system as well as investigate a potential role in the sex bias of SLE and pSS.  Western blot protein analysis, qPCR, BioPlex cytokine immunoassay, pHrodo™ assays, as well as  CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown experiments were employed to delineate the role of CXorf21 in relevant immunocytes.  Expressed in monocytes and B cells,  basal Mrna, and protein expression levels are elevated in female primary monocytes, B cells, and EBV-transformed B cells compared to male cells. We also found  mRNA and protein expression is higher in both male and female cells from SLE patients compared to control subjects. TLR7 ligation increased CXorf21 protein expression and  knockdown abrogated TLR7-driven increased  mRNA expression, and reduced secretion of both TNF-alpha and IL-6 in healthy female monocytes. Similarly, we found increased pH in the lysosomes of -deficient female monocytes.  CXorf21 is more highly expressed in female compared to male cells and is involved in a sexually dimorphic response to TLR7 activation. In addition, CXorf21 expression regulates lysosomal pH in a sexually dimorphic manner. Thus, sexually dimorphic expression of CXorf21 skews cellular immune responses in manner consistent with expected properties of a mediator of the X chromosome dose risk in SLE and pSS.Copyright © 2019 Harris, Koelsch, Kurien, Harley, Wren, Harley and Scofield.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696204>CXCR3 from chemokine receptor family correlates with immune infiltration and predicts poor survival in osteosarcoma.</a></h1><p>Chemokine receptors have a crucial role in regulating tumor mediating  and also implicated in the prognosis of some cancers. Here, the association between CXC chemokine receptors (CXCR2-5) and prognosis in osteosarcoma was studied.Differences between CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, and CXCR5 expression and overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses. The associations of CXCR3 expression with clinical features and the prognosis were also analyzed. The signaling pathways modulated by CXCR3 were investigated. The correlations between CXCR3 and immune infiltrates were investigated.The expression of CXCR2, CXCR4, and CXCR5 was not associated with the prognosis, but CXCR3 low expression was correlated with worse OS and EFS of osteosarcoma, especially for female, patients aged less than 15.1 years, or patients without metastasis. Low CXCR3 expression was related to tumor site and histologic response (P&lt;0.05), but not associated with other clinical characteristics. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that CXCR3 remained independently associated with the prognosis, especially for OS (HR = 3.26, 95% CI = 1.15-9.24, P = 0.026). The cell adhesion, apoptosis, metabolism, KRAS, P53, NOTCH, reactive oxygen species (ROS), PI3K/Akt/mTOR, VEGF, inflammation, and immune-related pathways such as IL-6/JAK/STAT3, TNF-α via NF-κB, Toll/NOD-like receptor, and complement were modulated by CXCR3. CXCR3 expression showed an especially positive correlation with immune infiltration of T cells CD8, macrophages M1, plasma cells, and NK cells activated.CXCR3 may be an independent risk factor for the prognosis and was most likely to benefit from immunotherapy in osteosarcoma.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695697>Immune Responses to Gametocyte Antigens in a Malaria Endemic Population-The African  Context: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h1><p> Malaria elimination remains a priority research agenda with the need for interventions that reduce and/or block malaria transmission from humans to mosquitoes. Transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) are in development, most of which target the transmission stage (i.e., gametocyte) antigens Pfs230 and Pfs48/45. For these interventions to be implemented, there is a need to understand the naturally acquired  to gametocytes. Several studies have measured the prevalence of immune responses to Pfs230 and Pfs48/45 in populations in malaria-endemic areas.  We conducted a systematic review of studies carried out in African populations that measured the prevalence of immune responses to the gametocyte antigens Pfs230 and Pfs48/45. We assessed seroprevalence of antibody responses to the two antigens and investigated the effects of covariates such as age, transmission intensity/endemicity, season, and parasite prevalence on the prevalence of these antibody responses by meta-regression.  We identified 12 studies covering 23 sites for inclusion in the analysis. We found that the range of reported seroprevalence to Pfs230 and Pfs48/45 varied widely across studies, from 0 to 64% for Pfs48/45 and from 6 to 72% for Pfs230. We also found a modest association between increased age and increased seroprevalence to Pfs230: adults were associated with higher seroprevalence estimates in comparison to children (β coefficient 0.21, 95% CI: 0.05-0.38,  = 0.042). Methodological factors were the most significant contributors to heterogeneity between studies which prevented calculation of pooled prevalence estimates.  Naturally acquired sexual stage , as detected by antibodies to Pfs230 and Pfs48/45, was present in most studies analyzed. Significant between-study heterogeneity was seen, and methodological factors were a major contributor to this, and prevented further analysis of epidemiological and biological factors. This demonstrates a need for standardized protocols for conducting and reporting seroepidemiological analyses.Copyright © 2019 Muthui, Kamau, Bousema, Blagborough, Bejon and Kapulu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695913>γδ T cells take the stage.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696572>Corrigendum.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694946>VAMP8 contributes to TRIM6-mediated type-I interferon antiviral response during West Nile virus infection.</a></h1><p>Several members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases regulate immune pathways including the antiviral type I interferon (IFN-I) system. Previously, we demonstrated that TRIM6 is involved in IFN-I induction and signaling. In the absence of TRIM6, optimal IFN-I signaling is reduced, allowing increased replication of interferon-sensitive viruses. Despite having evolved numerous mechanisms to restrict the vertebrate host's IFN-I response, West Nile virus (WNV) replication is sensitive to pre-treatment with IFN-I. However, the regulators and products of the IFN-I pathway that are important in regulating WNV replication are incompletely defined. Consistent with WNV's sensitivity to IFN-I, we found that in TRIM6 knockout (TRIM6-KO) A549 cells WNV replication is significantly increased and IFN-I induction and signaling is impaired compared to wild-type (wt) cells. IFNβ pre-treatment was more effective in protecting against subsequent WNV infection in wt cells as compared to TRIM6-KO, indicating that TRIM6 contributes to the establishment of an IFN-induced antiviral response against WNV. Using next generation sequencing, we identified VAMP8 as a potential factor involved in this TRIM6-mediated antiviral response. VAMP8 knockdown resulted in reduced Jak1 and STAT1 phosphorylation and impaired induction of several ISGs following WNV infection or IFNβ treatment. Furthermore, VAMP8-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation required the presence of TRIM6. Therefore, the VAMP8 protein is a novel regulator of IFN-I signaling, and its expression and function is dependent on TRIM6 activity. Overall, these results provide evidence that TRIM6 contributes to the antiviral response against WNV and identified VAMP8 as a novel regulator of the IFN-I system. WNV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that poses threat to human health across large discontinuous areas throughout the world. Infection with WNV results in febrile illness, which can progress to severe neurological disease. Currently, there are no approved treatment options to control WNV infection. Understanding the cellular immune responses that regulate viral replication is important in diversifying the resources available to control WNV. Here we show that the elimination of TRIM6 in human cells results in an increase in WNV replication and alters the expression and function of other components of the IFN-I pathway through VAMP8. Dissecting the interactions between WNV and host defenses both informs basic molecular virology and promotes the development of host- and viral-targeted antiviral strategies.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695669>Behcet's Disease With Cerebral Artery Infarction Caused by Cerebral Arteritis as an Early Symptom Only With Elevated Interleukin-8.</a></h1><p> Behcet's disease (BD) is multi-systemic vasculitis, which generally is repeated oral and genital ulcerations as well as ocular and skin lesions. Today, the pathogenesis of BD remains mostly unknown. It is also suggested that the disease is probably related to autoinflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and innate  damages were perceived as key in its pathologic process. Only 5% of BD patients have neurological involvement, and it usually occurs in 4-6 years after the initial symptoms. Early onset of neurological impairment makes it difficult to diagnose and treat definitely.  A 38-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with numbness and weakness of the left extremities. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed focal infarction in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Skin pathology suggested small vessel vasculitis, and high-resolution MRI revealed intracranial arteritis. The patient had a negative skin pathery test and then developed a scar at the venous puncture site at the early stage of disease. Laboratory examination showed that interleukin 8 (IL-8) increased. The patient was treated with an immunosuppressive agent including mycophenolate mofetil, hydroxychloroquine, and colchicine. All symptoms were alleviated after half a year's treatment. There was neither stroke nor recurrence of oral ulcer thereafter.  This case demonstrates that neurological involvement might be an early symptom of BD. IL-8 could act as a novel target for the treatment of BD theoretically and probably play a key role in disease recovery.Copyright © 2019 Yin, Song, Zheng, Han and Tang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695696>Gene- and Disease-Based Expansion of the Knowledge on Inborn Errors of .</a></h1><p>The recent report of the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) has provided the categorized list of 354 inborn errors of . We performed a systematic analysis of genes and diseases from the IUIS report with the use of the OMIM, ORPHANET, and HPO resources. To measure phenotypic similarity we applied the Jaccard/Tanimoto (J/T) coefficient for HPO terms and top-level categories. Low J/T coefficients for HPO terms for OMIM or ORPHANET disease pairs associated with the same genes indicated high pleiotropy of these genes. Gene ORGANizer enrichment analysis demonstrated that gene sets related to HPO top-level categories were most often enriched in immune, lymphatic, and corresponding body systems (for example, genes from the category "Cardiovascular" were enriched in cardiovascular system). We presented available data on frequent and very frequent clinical signs and symptoms in inborn errors of . With the use of DisGeNET, we generated the list of 25 IUIS/OMIM diseases with two or more relatively high score gene-disease associations, found for unrelated genes and/or for clusters of genes coding for interacting proteins.

These simple gammaretroviruses have been studied extensively in various facets of science for nearly half a century, yet we have surprisingly little quantitative information about some of the basic features of these viral particles. These include parameters such as the genome packaging efficiency and the number of particles required for a productive infection. The reason for this knowledge gap relies primarily on the technical challenge of accurately measuring intact viral particles from infected cell supernatants. Virus infected cells are well known to release soluble viral proteins, defective viruses and extracellular vesicles (EVs) harboring viral proteins that may mimic viruses, all of which can skew virus titer quantifications. Flow virometry, also known as nanoscale flow cytometry or simply small particle flow cytometry, is an emerging analytical method enabling high throughput single-virus phenotypic characterizations. By utilizing the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) and monodisperse light scattering characteristics as discerning parameters of intact virus particles, here we analyzed the basic properties of Moloney MLV (M-MLV). We show that less than 24% of total p30 capsid protein measured in infected cell supernatants is associated with intact viruses. We calculate that about one in five M-MLV particles contain a viral RNA genome pair and that individual intact particle infectivity is about 0.4%. These findings provide new insights into the characteristics of an extensively studied prototypical retrovirus, while highlighting the benefits of flow virometry for the field of virology. Gammaretroviruses, or more specifically murine leukemia viruses (MLVs), have been a longstanding model for studying retroviruses. Although being extensively analysed and dissected for decades, several facets of MLV biology are still poorly understood. One of the primary challenges has been enumerating total intact virus particles in a sample. While several analytical methods can precisely measure virus protein amounts, MLVs are known to induce the secretion of soluble and vesicle-associated viral proteins that can skew these measurements. With recent technological advances in flow cytometry, it is now possible to analyze viruses down to 90nm in diameter with an approach called flow virometry. The technique has the added benefit of being able to discriminate viruses from extracellular vesicles and free viral proteins in order to confidently provide an intact viral particle count. Here we used flow virometry to provide new insights into the basic characteristics of Moloney MLV.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p></html>
