This work reports a new facet of the putative CYP74C HPLs. Initially, we found that the recombinant CYP74C13_MT (Medicago truncatula) behaved predominantly as the epoxyalcohol synthase (EAS) towards the 9(S)-hydroperoxide of linoleic acid. At the same time, the CYP74C13_MT mostly possessed the HPL activity towards the 13(S)-hydroperoxides of linoleic and α-linolenic acids. To verify whether this dualistic behaviour of CYP74C13_MT is occasional or typical, we also examined five similar putative HPLs (CYP74C). These were CYP74C4_ST (Solanum tuberosum), CYP74C2 (Cucumis melo), CYP74C1_CS and CYP74C31 (both of Cucumis sativus), and CYP74C13_GM (Glycine max). All tested enzymes behaved predominantly as EAS toward 9-hydroperoxide of linoleic acid. Oxiranyl carbinols such as (9S,10S,11S,12Z)-9,10-epoxy-11-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acids were the major EAS products. Besides, the CYP74C31 possessed an additional minor 9-AOS activity. The mutant forms of CYP74C13_MT, CYP74C1_CS, and CYP74C31 with substitutions at the catalytically essential domains, namely the "hydroperoxide-binding domain" (I-helix), or the SRS-1 domain near the N-terminus, showed strong AOS activity. These HPLs to AOSs conversions were observed for the first time. Until now a large part of CYP74C enzymes has been considered as 9/13-HPLs. Notwithstanding, these results show that all studied putative CYP74C HPLs are in fact the versatile HPL/EASs that can be effortlessly mutated into specific AOSs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

At least ten genes attributed to four novel CYP74 subfamilies have been revealed by the recent sequencing of the spikemoss Selaginella moellendorffii Hieron genome. Two of these genes CYP74M1 and CYP74M3 have been cloned in the present study. Both recombinant proteins CYP74M1 and CYP74M3 were active towards the 13(S)-hydroperoxides of α-linolenic and linoleic acids (13-HPOT and 13-HPOD, respectively) and exhibited the activity of divinyl ether synthase (DES). Products were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Individual oxylipins were purified by HPLC and finally identified by their NMR data, including the (1)H NMR, 2D-COSY, HSQC and HMBC. CYP74M1 (SmDES1) specifically converted 13-HPOT to (11Z)-etherolenic acid and 13-HPOD to (11Z)-etheroleic acid. CYP74M3 (SmDES2) turned 13-HPOT and 13-HPOD mainly to etherolenic and etheroleic acids, respectively. CYP74M1 and CYP74M3 are the first DESs detected in non-flowering plants. The obtained results demonstrate the existence of the sophisticated oxylipin biosynthetic machinery in the oldest taxa of vascular plants.Copyright © 2016.

Organic hydroperoxides (ROOH) can be produced both by free radical reactions and enzymatic oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. ROOH have been shown to decompose to alkoxyl radicals via catalysis by transition metal ions, which may initiate lipid peroxidation or transform further to the reactive aldehydes. However, it is not clear whether XQ react with ROOH in a similar manner to generate alkoxyl radicals metal-independently. By complementary applications of ESR spin-trapping, HPLC/high resolution mass spectrometric and other analytical methods, we found that 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ) could significantly enhance the decomposition of a model ROOH tert-butylhydroperoxide, resulting in the formation of t-butoxyl radicals independent of transition metals. On the basis of the above findings, we detected and identified, for the first time, an unprecedented C-centered quinone ketoxy radical. Then, we extended our study to the more physiologically relevant endogenous ROOH  and found that DCBQ could also markedly enhance its decomposition to generate the reactive lipid alkyl radicals and the genotoxic 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE). Similar results were observed with other XQ. In summary, these findings demonstrated that XQ can facilitate ROOH decomposition to produce reactive alkoxyl, quinone ketoxy, lipid alkyl radicals, and genotoxic HNE via a novel metal-independent mechanism, which may explain partly their potential genotoxicity and carcinogenicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27549797>A novel chiral stationary phase HPLC-MS/MS method to discriminate between enzymatic oxidation and auto-oxidation of phosphatidylcholine.</a></h2><p>To elucidate the role of enzymatic lipid peroxidation in disease pathogenesis and in food deterioration, we recently achieved stereoselective analysis of phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide (PCOOH) possessing 13S-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (13(S)-9Z,11E-HPODE) using HPLC-MS/MS with a CHIRALPAK OP (+) column. Because enzymatic oxidation progresses concurrently with auto-oxidation, we need to distinguish them further. Here, we attempted such an analysis. First, we used lipoxygenase, linoleic acid, and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to synthesize the enzymatic oxidation product 13(S)-9Z,11E-HPODE PC, and the auto-oxidation products 13(RS)-9Z,11E-HPODE PC and 13(RS)-9E,11E-HPODE PC, which were used as standards to test the ability of various columns to separate the enzymatic oxidation product from auto-oxidation products. Separation was achieved by connecting in series two columns with different properties: CHIRALPAK OP (+) and CHIRALPAK IB-3. The CHIRALPAK OP (+) column separated 13(R)-9Z,11E-HPODE PC and 13(S)-9Z,11E-HPODE PC, whereas CHIRALPAK IB-3 enabled separation of 13(S)-9Z,11E-HPODE PC and 13(RS)-9E,11E-HPODE PC. The results for the analysis of both enzymatically oxidized and auto-oxidized lecithin (an important phospholipid mixture in vivo and in food) indicate that our method would be useful for distinguishing enzymatic oxidation and auto-oxidation reactions. Such information will be invaluable for elucidating the involvement of PCOOH in disease pathogenesis and in food deterioration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25977701>Metabolomics profiling to investigate the pharmacologic mechanisms of berberine for the treatment of high-fat diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Berberine has been used to treat nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which has been addressed in many studies. In this study, we investigated the molecular pharmacology mechanisms of berberine using metabolomic techniques.Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups (10 rats in each group): (i) normal control group; (ii) high-fat diet- (HFD-) induced NASH model group; and (iii) HFD berberine-treated group (i.d. 200 mg/kg). The handling procedure lasted eight weeks. Then, UPLC-Q-TOF/MS techniques coupled with histopathology and biochemical analyses were adopted to explore the mechanisms of berberine on the protective effects against NASH.(i) According to conventional test results, berberine treatment plays a fighting role in HFD-induced NASH due to its beneficial effects against insulin resistance, , and lipid metabolism. (ii) Based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS techniques, metabolic profiles that involved sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylcholine (PC), lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC), 13-hydroperoxy-9, 11-octadecadienoic acid (), eicosatrienoic acid, docosatrienoic acid, and eicosenoic acid could provide potential metabolic biomarkers to address the pharmacological mechanisms of berberine.The parts of molecular pharmacological mechanisms of berberine for NASH treatment are related to the regulation of metabolic disruption involving phospholipid and unsaturated fatty acids in rats with NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27818578>Apoptosis of Endothelial Cells by  Contributes to Impairment of Endothelial Barrier Integrity.</a></h2><p> is an essential host response during bacterial infections such as bovine mastitis. Endothelial cells are critical for an appropriate inflammatory response and loss of vascular barrier integrity is implicated in the pathogenesis of -induced mastitis. Previous studies suggested that accumulation of linoleic acid (LA) oxygenation products derived from 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) metabolism could regulate vascular functions. The initial LA derivative from the 15-LOX-1 pathway, 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (HPODE), can induce endothelial death, whereas the reduced hydroxyl product, 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), is abundantly produced during vascular activation. However, the relative contribution of specific LA-derived metabolites on impairment of mammary endothelial integrity is unknown. Our hypothesis was that -induced LA-derived 15-LOX-1 oxygenation products impair mammary endothelial barrier integrity by apoptosis. Exposure of bovine mammary endothelial cells (BMEC) to  did not increase 15-LOX-1 LA metabolism. However,  challenge of bovine monocytes demonstrated that monocytes may be a significant source of both  and 13-HODE during mastitis. Exposure of BMEC to , but not 13-HODE, significantly reduced endothelial barrier integrity and increased apoptosis. Changing oxidant status by coexposure to an antioxidant during  treatment prevented adverse effects of , including amelioration of apoptosis. A better understanding of how the oxidant status of the vascular microenvironment impacts endothelial barrier properties could lead to more efficacious treatments for  mastitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27012748>Hormetic and regulatory effects of lipid peroxidation mediators in pancreatic beta cells.</a></h2><p>Nutrient sensing mechanisms of carbohydrates, amino acids and lipids operate distinct  that are essential for the adaptation to varying  conditions. The role of nutrient-induced biosynthesis of hormones is paramount for attaining  homeostasis in the organism. Nutrient overload attenuate key  cellular functions and interfere with hormonal-regulated inter- and intra-organ communication, which may ultimately lead to  derangements. Hyperglycemia and high levels of saturated free fatty acids induce excessive production of oxygen free radicals in tissues and cells. This phenomenon, which is accentuated in both type-1 and type-2 diabetic patients, has been associated with the development of impaired glucose tolerance and the etiology of peripheral complications. However, low levels of the same free radicals also induce hormetic responses that protect cells against deleterious effects of the same radicals. Of interest is the role of hydroxyl radicals in initiating peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and generation of α,β-unsaturated reactive 4-hydroxyalkenals that avidly form covalent adducts with nucleophilic moieties in proteins, phospholipids and nucleic acids. Numerous studies have linked the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-2E-nonenal (4-HNE) to different pathological and cytotoxic processes. Similarly, two other members of the family, 4-hydroxyl-2E-hexenal (4-HHE) and 4-hydroxy-2E,6Z-dodecadienal (4-HDDE), have also been identified as potential cytotoxic agents. It has been suggested that 4-HNE-induced modifications in macromolecules in cells may alter their cellular functions and modify signaling properties. Yet, it has also been acknowledged that these bioactive aldehydes also function as signaling molecules that directly modify cell functions in a hormetic fashion to enable cells adapt to various stressful stimuli. Recent studies have shown that 4-HNE and 4-HDDE, which activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) in vascular endothelial cells and insulin secreting beta cells, promote such adaptive responses to ameliorate detrimental effects of high glucose and diabetes-like conditions. In addition, due to the electrophilic nature of these reactive aldehydes they form covalent adducts with electronegative moieties in proteins, phosphatidylethanolamine and nucleotides. Normally these non-enzymatic modifications are maintained below the cytotoxic range due to efficient cellular neutralization processes of 4-hydroxyalkenals. The major neutralizing enzymes include fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), aldose reductase (AR) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which transform the aldehyde to the corresponding carboxylic acid or alcohols, respectively, or by biding to the thiol group in glutathione (GSH) by the action of glutathione-S-transferase (GST). This review describes the hormetic and cytotoxic roles of oxygen free radicals and 4-hydroxyalkenals in beta cells exposed to nutritional challenges and the cellular mechanisms they employ to maintain their level at functional range below the cytotoxic threshold.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

During industrial olive oil production, these enzymes are activated upon crushing and grinding of olive fruit tissue, subsequently leading to the synthesis of volatile compounds responsible for the positive aroma and flavor of the oil. An investigation of LOX activity during olive fruit ripening and malaxation could assist in the production of oils with favorable aroma and taste. Therefore, a reliable method for olive LOX purification is crucial. Here we report a critical review of six LOX extraction protocols, two of which have shown minimum enzyme activity, possibly leading to misconceptions in the interpretation of experimental data. Future research concerning olive LOX should employ extraction methods that preserve enzyme activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27863255>Epoxyalcohol synthase of Ectocarpus siliculosus. First CYP74-related enzyme of oxylipin biosynthesis in brown algae.</a></h2><p>Enzymes of CYP74 family play the central role in the biosynthesis of physiologically important oxylipins in land plants. Although a broad diversity of oxylipins is known in the algae, no CYP74s or related enzymes have been detected in brown algae yet. Cloning of the first CYP74-related gene CYP5164B1 of brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus is reported in present work. The recombinant protein was incubated with several fatty acid hydroperoxides. Linoleic acid 9-hydroperoxide (9-HPOD) was the preferred substrate, while linoleate 13-hydroperoxide (13-HPOD) was less efficient. α-Linolenic acid 9- and 13-hydroperoxides, as well as eicosapentaenoic acid 15-hydroperoxide were inefficient substrates. Both 9-HPOD and 13-HPOD were converted into epoxyalcohols. For instance, 9-HPOD was turned primarily into (9S,10S,11S,12Z)-9,10-epoxy-11-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid. Both epoxide and hydroxyl oxygen atoms of the epoxyalcohol were incorporated mostly from [O]9-HPOD. Thus, the enzyme exhibits the activity of epoxyalcohol synthase (EsEAS). The results show that the EsEAS isomerizes the hydroperoxides into epoxyalcohols via epoxyallylic radical, a common intermediate of different CYP74s and related enzymes. EsEAS can be considered as an archaic prototype of CYP74 family enzymes.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigated the use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to develop a method for accurate quantification of PCOOH (1-palmitoyl-2-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 16:0/HpODE PC), focusing on isomers such as 16:0/ PC and 16:0/9-HpODE PC. Sodiated PCOOH ([M+Na](+), m/z 812) provided not only a known product ion (m/z 147) but also characteristic product ions (m/z 541 for 16:0/ PC and m/z 388 for 16:0/9-HpODE PC). Thus, three multiple reaction monitorings (MRMs) could be performed. MRM (812/147) enabled determination of 16:0/HpODE PC, and MRM (812/541) and MRM (812/388) allowed specific measurement of 16:0/ PC and 16:0/9-HpODE PC, respectively. By using this method, we could determine plasma PCOOH concentrations in healthy subjects and patients with angiographically significant stenosis. In healthy subject and patient plasma, the concentration of 16:0/HpODE PC was close to the sum of the concentrations of 16:0/ PC and 16:0/9-HpODE PC. This finding shows that radical and/or enzymatic oxidation, rather than singlet oxygen oxidation, is recognized to cause peroxidation of PC. The newly developed LC-MS/MS method appears to be a powerful tool for developing a better understanding of in vivo lipid peroxidation and its involvement in human diseases.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Thereby fatty acid hydroperoxide represent a common intermediate, also in human innate immune cells, like neutrophil granulocytes. In these cells a further key component is the heme protein myeloperoxidase producing HOCl as a reactive oxidant. On the basis of different investigation a reaction of the fatty acid hydroperoxide and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) could be assumed. Here, chromatographic and spectrometric analysis revealed that the hydroperoxide moiety of 15S-​hydroperoxy-​5Z,​8Z,​11Z,​13E-​eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HpETE) and 13S-​hydroperoxy-​9Z,​11E-​octadecadienoic acid () is not affected by HOCl. No reduction of the hydroperoxide group due to a reaction with HOCl could be measured. It could be demonstrated that the double bonds of the fatty acid hydroperoxides are the major target of HOCl, present either as reagent or formed by the myeloperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-chloride system.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The development of a single-target treatment strategy for AD has not been successful. Shengmai-San (SMS), a traditional Chinese medicine containing multi-active components, has been reported to be effective for treating AD. However, the mechanism of SMS is still unclear, and as a multicomponent combination therapy, there is a lack of appropriate evaluation. Thereby, metabolomics was applied to investigate the multi-target intervention of SMS by monitoring the fold changes of metabolites in serum. An AD model was successfully replicated by treating rats with oral aluminum chloride (AlCl) and an intraperitoneal injection of d-galactose (d-gal) for 105 days. The intervention group was treated with SMS during the whole modeling process. The results of classical experiments showed that SMS could alleviate Aβ deposition, protect neurons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus and improve spatial learning and memory impairment compared with the model group. Based on these curative effects, a metabolomics study was implemented using the UPLC-Q/TOF-MS method. A heatmap of AD-associated metabolites (P < 0.05) was set up to target the most relevant  network and to evaluate the comprehensive effects of SMS. Based on this AD-associated  network, the total regulation-of-metabolites' coverage rate of SMS was 51.35% and the gross metabolites' recovery proportion was 72.32%. Lipid peroxidation was the main mechanism of SMS intervention in AD, including inhibition of the generation of linoleic acid hydroperoxides, such as , 9-HPODE and 9-OxoODE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29095495>Regioisomeric distribution of 9- and 13-hydroperoxy linoleic acid in vegetable oils during storage and heating.</a></h2><p>The oxidative deterioration of vegetable oils is commonly measured by the peroxide value, thereby not considering the contribution of individual lipid hydroperoxide isomers, which might have different bioactive effects. Thus, the formation of 9- and 13-hydroperoxy octadecadienoic acid (9-HpODE and 13- HpODE), was quantified after short-term heating and conditions representative of long-term domestic storage in samples of linoleic acid, canola, sunflower and soybean oil, by means of stable isotope dilution analysis-liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy.Although heating of pure linoleic acid at 180 °C for 30 min led to an almost complete loss of 9-HpODE and , heating of canola, sunflower and soybean oil resulted in the formation of 5.74 ± 3.32, 2.00 ± 1.09, 16.0 ± 2.44 mmol L  and 13.8 ± 8.21, 10.0 ± 6.74 and 45.2 ± 6.23 mmol L 9-HpODE. An almost equimolar distribution of the 9- and  was obtained during household-representative storage conditions after 56 days, whereas, under heating conditions, an approximately 2.4-, 2.8- and 5.0-fold (P ≤ 0.001) higher concentration of 9-HpODE than  was detected in canola, soybean and sunflower oil, respectively.A temperature-dependent distribution of HpODE regioisomers could be shown in vegetable oils, suggesting their application as markers of lipid oxidation in oils used for short-term heating. © 2017 The Authors.
