Here, we show that glycogen synthase kinase-3α (GSK-3α) mediates lipid accumulation in the heart. Fatty  (FAs) upregulate GSK-3α, which phosphorylates PPARα at Ser280 in the ligand-binding domain (LBD). This modification ligand independently enhances transcription of a subset of PPARα targets, selectively stimulating FA uptake and storage, but not oxidation, thereby promoting lipid accumulation. Constitutively active GSK-3α, but not GSK-3β, was sufficient to drive PPARα signaling, while cardiac-specific knockdown of GSK-3α, but not GSK-3β, or replacement of PPARα Ser280 with Ala conferred resistance to lipotoxicity in the heart. Fibrates, PPARα ligands, inhibited phosphorylation of PPARα at Ser280 by inhibiting the interaction of GSK-3α with the LBD of PPARα, thereby reversing lipotoxic cardiomyopathy. These results suggest that GSK-3α promotes lipid anabolism through PPARα-Ser280 phosphorylation, which underlies the development of lipotoxic cardiomyopathy in the context of .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We used a metabolic syndrome rat model, produced by feeding a 35 % high-fat diet (HFD), to examine potential anti-obesity and anti-metabolic syndrome effects and mechanisms of chronic administration of ASP. These effects were compared with Eucommia leaf extract (ELE), the positive control, which exhibits anti-obesity effects. A total of six rats were studied for 3 months in five groups. ASP suppressed body weight, visceral fat weight, food intake and circulating levels of glucose, insulin and lipids, and increased the plasma adiponectin level in rats on a HFD. These effects are similar to those of ELE, except for the influence on the plasma glucose level. RT-PCR studies showed that ASP (like ELE with known anti-obesity effects) diminished isocitrate dehydrogenase 3α, NADH dehydrogenase flavoprotein 1 (Comp I) mRNA and   synthase levels (white adipose tissue), increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, very-long-chain mRNA levels (), and increased Glut4, citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase 3α, succinyl CoA synthase, peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, dihydrolipoamide succinyl transferase and succinate dehydrogenase mRNA levels (skeletal muscle) under HFD conditions. Interestingly, ASP administration resulted in significantly increased mRNA levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in the brown adipose tissue of HFD-fed rats; ELE did not affect the expression of UCP1. The increased expression of UCP1 may be negated by many ingredients other than ASP in the ELE. These findings suggest that chronic administration of ASP stimulates anti-obesity and anti-metabolic syndrome activity in HFD-fed rats across several organs, similar to ELE administration; thus, ASP may be an important ingredient of ELE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15892178>Measurement of bile  CoA esters by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS).</a></h2><p>The novel and rapid assay presented here combines high-performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) to directly measure and quantify the CoA esters of ,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy- and ,7alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oic  (THCA and DHCA). The latter are converted inside peroxisomes to the primary bile , cholic and chenodeoxycholic , respectively. Prior to MS/MS, esters were separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a C(18) column using an isocratic mobile phase (acetonitrile/water/2-propanol) and subsequently detected by multiple reaction monitoring. For quantification, the CoA ester of deuterium-labelled ,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholan-24-oic  (d(4)-CA) was used as internal standard. To complete an assay took less than 8 min. To verify the validity of the assay, the effect of peroxisomal proteins on the efficacy of extraction of the CoA esters was tested. To this end, variable amounts of the CoA esters were spiked with a fixed amount of either intact peroxisomes or peroxisomal matrix proteins and then extracted using a solid-phase extraction system. The CoA esters could be reproducibly recovered in the range of 0.1-4 micromol l(-1) (linear correlation coefficient R(2) > 0.99), with a detection limit of 0.1 micromol l(-1). In summary, electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry combined with HPLC as described here proved to be a rapid and versatile technique for the determination of bile  CoA esters in a mixture with peroxisomal proteins. This suggests this technique to become a valuable tool in studies dealing with the multi-step biosynthesis of bile  and its disturbances in disorders like the Zellweger syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594827>Distinct Gut Microbiota Induced by Different Fat-to-Sugar-Ratio High-Energy Diets Share Similar Pro- Genetic and Metabolite Profiles in Prediabetic Mice.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota play important roles in host metabolism, especially in diabetes. However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different microbiota is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different fat-to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the microbiota and early-stage metabolic syndrome. The two diets resulted in different microbiota but similar diabetic states. Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic , cholestan-3-ol (5β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with lipogenesis and inflammation. Our study suggests that different metabolic-syndrome-inducing diets may result in different microbiota but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of  and metabolic syndrome. Various types of diet can lead to type 2 diabetes. The gut microbiota in type 2 diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut microbiota induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease. Here we found that high-energy diets with two different fat-to-sugar ratios can both cause  and prediabetes but enrich different gut microbiota. Still, these different gut microbiota have similar genetic and metabolite compositions. The microbial metabolites in common between the diets modulate lipid accumulation and macrophage inflammation  and  This work suggests that studies that only use 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine how the microbes respond to diet and associate with diabetic state are missing vital information.Copyright © 2019 Shan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6604>The metabolism of , 7alpha, 12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oic  into cholic: an enzyme assay using homogenates of human .</a></h2><p>An enzyme assay was developed to measure the conversion of the bile  precursor, , 7alpha, 12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oic  (THCA), into cholic  using homogenates of human  biopsies.
