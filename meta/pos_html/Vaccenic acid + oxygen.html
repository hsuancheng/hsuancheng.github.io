The results obtained strongly suggest that these enzymatic processes involve the initial dioxygenase-mediated formation of 1 O-hydroperoxyoctadec-cis-11-enoic acid, which is not accumulated in the cells of T. halophila owing to its high cytotoxic properties. Deuterium labeling and GC-MS analyses enabled us to demonstrate that subsequent enzymatic conversions of this allylic hydroperoxide involved reduction, cleavage, isomerization, and saturation reactions. Some of the specific oxidation products thus formed could constitute potential T. halophila biomarkers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17464521>Authenticating production origin of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) by chemical and isotopic fingerprinting.</a></h2><p>Recent EU legislation (EC/2065/2001) requires that fish products, of wild and farmed origin, must provide consumer information that describes geographical origin and production method. The aim of the present study was to establish methods that could reliably differentiate between wild and farmed European gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). The methods that were chosen were based on chemical and stable isotopic analysis of the readily accessible lipid fraction. This study examined fatty acid profiles by capillary gas chromatography and the isotopic composition of fish oil (delta(13)C, delta(18)O), phospholipid choline nitrogen (delta(15)N) and compound specific analysis of fatty acids (delta(13)C) by isotope ratio mass spectroscopy as parameters that could reliably discriminate samples of wild and farmed sea bream. The sample set comprised of 15 farmed and 15 wild gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), obtained from Greece and Spain, respectively. Discrimination was achieved using fatty acid compositions, with linoleic acid (18:2n-6), arachidonic acid (20:4n-6), stearic acid (18:0),  (18:1n-7) and docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3) providing the highest contributions for discrimination. Principle components analysis of the data set highlighted good discrimination between wild and farmed fish. Factor 1 and 2 accounted for >70% of the variation in the data. The variables contributing to this discrimination were: the fatty acids 14:0, 16:0, 18:0, 18:1n-9, 18:1n-7, 22:1n-11, 18:2n-6 and 22:5n-3; delta(13)C of the fatty acids 16:0, 18:0, 16:1n-7, 18:1n-9, 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3; Bulk oil fraction delta(13)C; glycerol/choline fraction bulk delta(13)C; delta(15)N; % N; % lipid.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1593259>Temperature adaptation in Lactobacillus fermentum: interconversions of oleic, vaccenic and dihydrosterulic acids.</a></h2><p>The interchange of octadecenoic acids and dihydrosterulic acid was a response of aerobically growing Lactobacillus fermentum to changes in growth temperature. Oleic and  contents decreased both at temperatures below 20 degrees C and above 26 degrees C, showing mirror image behaviour, with a concomitant increase in dihydrosterulic acid. A temperature-dependent shift from vaccenic to oleic acid synthesis, and the conversion of the latter to dihydrosterulic acid was responsible for the overall change. Consequently, the degree of fatty acid unsaturation decreased at temperatures above 26 degrees C, whereas the degree of cyclization increased. The converse occurred below 20 degrees C. The relative amount of lactobacillic acid, total cellular fatty acid content, and mean fatty acid chain length were practically temperature-independent. The occurrence of oleic acid is thought to be related to aerobic growth conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20075076>Biochemical characterization of the oxygenation of unsaturated fatty acids by the dioxygenase and hydroperoxide isomerase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 42A2.</a></h2><p>We have studied oxygenation of fatty acids by cell extract of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 42A2. Oleic acid ((9Z)-18:1) was transformed to (10S)-hydroperoxy-(8E)-octadecenoic acid ((10S)-HPOME) and to (7S,10S)-dihydroxy-(8E)-octadecenoic acid (7,10-DiHOME). Experiments under -18 showed that 7,10-DiHOME contained  from air and was formed sequentially from (10S)-HPOME by isomerization. (10R)-HPOME was not isomerized. The (10S)-dioxygenase and hydroperoxide isomerase activities co-eluted on ion exchange chromatography and on gel filtration with an apparent molecular size of approximately 50 kDa. 16:1n-7, 18:2n-6, and 20:1n-11 were also oxygenated to 7,10-dihydroxy fatty acids, and (8Z)-18:1 was oxygenated to 6,9-dihydroxy-(7E)-octadecenoic acid. A series of fatty acids with the double bond positioned closer to ((6Z)-18:1, (5Z,9Z)-18:2) or more distant from the carboxyl group ((11Z)-, (13Z)-, and (15Z)-18:1) were poor substrates. The oxygenation mechanism was studied with [7S-(2)H]18:1n-9, [7R-(2)H]18:2n-6, and [8R-(2)H]18:2n-6 as substrates. The pro-R hydrogen at C-8 was lost in the biosynthesis of (10S)-HPODE, whereas the pro-S hydrogen was lost and the pro-R hydrogen was retained at C-7 during biosynthesis of the 7,10-dihydroxy metabolites. Analysis of the fatty acid composition of P. aeruginosa revealed relatively large amounts of (9E/Z)-16:1 and (11E/Z)-18:1 and only traces of 18:1n-9. We found that (11Z)-18:1 () was transformed to (11S,14S)-dihydroxy-(12E)-octadecenoic acid and to a mixture of 11- and 12-HPOME, possibly due to reverse orientation of (11Z)-18:1 at the active site compared with oleic acid. The reaction mechanism of the hydroperoxide isomerase suggests catalytic similarities to cytochrome P450.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6414520>Metabolism of linoleic acid by prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase from adult and fetal blood vessels.</a></h2><p>Linoleic acid (18:2) is converted by prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase in particulate fractions and homogenates of fetal calf aorta to its 9- and 13-hydroperoxy metabolites. These intermediates are then either dehydrated to the corresponding oxo compounds or reduced to monohydroxy products. Alternatively, the hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acids can be converted to epoxyhydroxyoctadecenoic acids, which are hydrolyzed to trihydroxy metabolites by epoxide hydrolases present in both particulate and cytosolic fractions from aorta. Linoleic acid (Km, 442 microM) is a much poorer substrate for prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase than is arachidonic acid (20:4) (Km, 48 microM). However, the oxygenation of 18:2 by particulate fractions from aorta is linear with time for at least 5 min, whereas the oxygenation of 20:4 is linear for only 15 s. Arachidonic acid strongly inhibits the conversion of 18:2 to monohydroxy (ID50, 10 microM) and trihydroxy (ID50, 140 microM) products. Linoleic acid has a similar, but much weaker effect on the formation of 6-oxoprostaglandin F1 alpha from 20:4. Substantial amounts of both the monohydroxy (9-hydroxy-10, 12-octadecadienoic acid and 13-hydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid) and trihydroxy (9,10,11-trihydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid, 9,10,13-trihydroxy- and 9,12,13-trihydroxy-10-octadecenoic acid) metabolites of 18:2 were shown by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to be formed from endogenous substrate during incubation of slices of fetal calf aorta in physiological medium. This raises the possibility that some of these products or their hydroperoxy precursors may have some biological significance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19663909>Glutathione transferases kappa 1 and kappa 2 localize in peroxisomes and mitochondria, respectively, and are involved in lipid metabolism and respiration in Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h2><p>To elucidate the function of kappa class glutathione transferases (GSTs) in multicellular organisms, their expression and silencing were investigated in Caenorhabditis elegans. In contrast with most vertebrates, which possess only one GST kappa gene, two distinct genes encoding GSTK-1 and GSTK-2 are present in the C. elegans genome. The amino acid sequences of GSTK-1 and GSTK-2 share around 30% similarity with the human hGSTK1 sequence and, like the human transferase, GSTK-1 contains a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting sequence. gstk-1 and gstk-2 genes show distinct developmental and tissue expression patterns. We show that GSTK-2 is localized in the mitochondria and expressed mainly in the pharynx, muscles and epidermis, whereas GSTK-1 is restricted to peroxisomes and expressed in the intestine, body wall muscles and epidermis. In order to determine the potential role(s) of GST kappa genes in C. elegans, specific silencing of the gstk-1 and gstk-2 genes was performed by an RNA interference approach. Knockdown of gstk-1 or gstk-2 had no apparent effect on C. elegans reproduction, development, locomotion or lifespan. By contrast, when biological functions ( consumption and lipid metabolism) related to peroxisomes and/or mitochondria were investigated, we observed a significant decrease in respiration rate and a lower concentration of the monounsaturated fatty acid cis- (18:1omega7) when worms were fed on bacteria expressing RNA interference targeting both gstk-1 and gstk-2. These results demonstrate that GST kappa, although not essential for the worm's life, may be involved in energetic and lipid metabolism, two functions related to mitochondria and peroxisomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1654290>-dependent antagonism of lipid peroxidation.</a></h2><p>Measurements of the rates for formation of conjugated dienes, malonylaldehyde, and lipid hydroperoxides show that increasing the concentration of O2 from 0.11 mM to 0.35 mM or 0.69 mM can slow the rate of linoleic acid peroxidation in a xanthine oxidase/hypoxanthine system. This effect is seen at pH 7.0 but not 7.4 and depends on the presence of monounsaturated fatty acids (oleic, cis, or trans ).  antagonism of ascorbic acid-iron-EDTA mediated lipid peroxidation is similarly dependent on fatty acid mixtures and occurs at pH 5.0 and 6.0 but not 7.0. The efficiency of initiation of peroxidation in the xanthine oxidase system is unaffected by monounsaturated fatty acids and O2 concentration. Increasing the O2 concentration increases the rate of superoxide radical production, but there is no change in salicylate hydroxylation (e.g., OH. production) or ferrous ion concentration. -mediated slower rates of lipid peroxidation are associated with either increased H2O2 production or, based on an indirect assay, singlet O2 production. Increased O2 concentrations increase the rate of azobisisobutyronitrile-initiated lipid peroxidation as expected but addition of exogenous superoxide radicals slows the rate. Under similar conditions superoxide reacts with fatty acids to produce singlet O2. Overall, the data suggest that O2-mediated antagonism occurs because of termination reactions between hydroperoxyl (HO2.) and organic radicals, and singlet O2 or H2O2 are products of these reactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12620835>Ethanol tolerance in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is dependent on cellular oleic acid content.</a></h2><p>In this investigation, we examined the effects of different unsaturated fatty acid compositions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on the growth-inhibiting effects of ethanol. The unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) composition of S. cerevisiae is relatively simple, consisting almost exclusively of the mono-UFAs palmitoleic acid (Delta(9)Z-C(16:1)) and oleic acid (Delta(9)Z-C(18:1)), with the former predominating. Both UFAs are formed in S. cerevisiae by the - and NADH-dependent desaturation of palmitic acid (C(16:0)) and stearic acid (C(18:0)), respectively, catalyzed by a single integral membrane desaturase encoded by the OLE1 gene. We systematically altered the UFA composition of yeast cells in a uniform genetic background (i) by genetic complementation of a desaturase-deficient ole1 knockout strain with cDNA expression constructs encoding insect desaturases with distinct regioselectivities (i.e., Delta(9) and Delta(11)) and substrate chain-length preferences (i.e., C(16:0) and C(18:0)); and, (ii) by supplementation of the same strain with synthetic mono-UFAs. Both experimental approaches demonstrated that oleic acid is the most efficacious UFA in overcoming the toxic effects of ethanol in growing yeast cells. Furthermore, the only other UFA tested that conferred a nominal degree of ethanol tolerance is cis- (Delta(11)Z-C(18:1)), whereas neither Delta(11)Z-C(16:1) nor palmitoleic acid (Delta(9)Z-C(16:1)) conferred any ethanol tolerance. We also showed that the most ethanol-tolerant transformant, which expresses the insect desaturase TniNPVE, produces twice as much oleic acid as palmitoleic acid in the absence of ethanol and undergoes a fourfold increase in the ratio of oleic acid to palmitoleic acid in response to exposure to 5% ethanol. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ethanol tolerance in yeast results from incorporation of oleic acid into lipid membranes, effecting a compensatory decrease in membrane fluidity that counteracts the fluidizing effects of ethanol.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20865247>Effects of selected food phytochemicals in reducing the toxic actions of TCDD and p,p'-DDT in U937 macrophages.</a></h2><p>To assess the effectiveness of selected food phytochemicals in reducing the toxic effects of the environmental toxicants, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and p,p'-DDT (DDT), we tested the potencies of auraptene, nobiletin, zerumbone, and (±)-13-hydroxy-10-oxo-trans- (13-HOA) in reversing the inflammatory action of these toxicants in U937 human macrophages. Using quantitative RT-PCR as the initial screening assay, we identified antagonistic actions of zerumbone and auraptene against the action of TCDD and DDT in up-regulating the mRNA expressions of COX-2 and VEGF. The functional significance of the inhibitory action of zerumbone on COX-2 expression was confirmed by demonstrating its suppression of TCDD-induced activation of COX-2 gene expression in mouse MMDD1 cells. We tested auraptene on DDT-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in U937 macrophages and found that auraptene is a powerful agent antagonizing this action of DDT. To confirm the significance of these actions of zerumbone and auraptene at the cellular level, we assessed their influence on TCDD-induced apoptosis resistance in intact U937 macrophages and found that they are capable of reversing this action of TCDD. In conclusion, zerumbone and auraptene were identified to be the most effective agents in protecting U937 macrophages from developing these cell toxic effects of TCDD and DDT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28360100>-Fatty acids promote proinflammatory signaling and cell death by stimulating the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)-p38 pathway.</a></h2><p>Food-borne -fatty acids (TFAs) are mainly produced as byproducts during food manufacture. Recent epidemiological studies have revealed that TFA consumption is a major risk factor for various disorders, including atherosclerosis. However, the underlying mechanisms in this disease etiology are largely unknown. Here we have shown that TFAs potentiate activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) induced by extracellular ATP, a damage-associated molecular pattern leaked from injured cells. Major food-associated TFAs such as elaidic acid (EA), linoelaidic acid, and -, but not their corresponding  isomers, dramatically enhanced extracellular ATP-induced apoptosis, accompanied by elevated activation of the ASK1-p38 pathway in a macrophage-like cell line, RAW264.7. Moreover, knocking out the ASK1-encoding gene abolished EA-mediated enhancement of apoptosis. We have reported previously that extracellular ATP induces apoptosis through the ASK1-p38 pathway activated by reactive oxygen species generated downstream of the P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X). However, here we show that EA did not increase ATP-induced reactive oxygen species generation but, rather, augmented the effects of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II-dependent ASK1 activation. These results demonstrate that TFAs promote extracellular ATP-induced apoptosis by targeting ASK1 and indicate novel TFA-associated pathways leading to inflammatory signal transduction and cell death that underlie the pathogenesis and progression of TFA-induced atherosclerosis. Our study thus provides insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of and proposes potential therapeutic targets for these TFA-related disorders.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17292324>Effect of hydrogen peroxide production and the Fenton reaction on membrane composition of Streptococcus pneumoniae.</a></h2><p>As part of its aerobic metabolism, Streptococcus pneumoniae generates high levels of H(2)O(2) by pyruvate oxidase (SpxB), which can be further reduced to yield the damaging hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction. A universal conserved adaptation response observed among bacteria is the adjustment of the membrane fatty acids to various growth conditions. The aim of the present study was to reveal the effect of endogenous reactive  species (ROS) formation on membrane composition of S. pneumoniae. Blocking carbon aerobic metabolism, by growing the bacteria at anaerobic conditions or by the truncation of the spxB gene, resulted in a significant enhancement in fatty acid unsaturation, mainly cis-. Moreover, reducing the level of OH(.) by growing the bacteria at acidic pH, or in the presence of an OH(.) scavenger (salicylate), resulted in increased fatty acid unsaturation, similar to that obtained under anaerobic conditions. RT-PCR results demonstrated that this change does not originate from a change in mRNA expression level of the fatty acid synthase II genes. We suggest that endogenous ROS play an important regulatory role in membrane adaptation, allowing the survival of this anaerobic organism at aerobic environments of the host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9216888>The effect of ethanol and  on the growth of Zymomonas mobilis and the levels of hopanoids and other membrane lipids.</a></h2><p>Zymomonas mobilis (ATCC 29191) was grown either aerobically or anaerobically in the presence of 2% (wt/vol) glucose and 0, 3, or 6% (vol/vol) ethanol. The rates of growth and the composition of hopanoids, cellular fatty acids, and other lipids in the bacterial membranes were quantitatively analyzed. The bacterium grew in the presence of 3% and 6% ethanol and was more ethanol tolerant when grown anaerobically. In the absence of ethanol, hopanoids comprised about 30% (by mass) of the total cellular lipids. Addition of ethanol to the media caused complex changes in the levels of hopanoids and other lipids. However, there was not a significant increase in any of the hopanoid lipid classes as ethanol concentration was increased. As previously reported,  was the most abundant fatty acid in the lipids of Z. mobilis, and its high constitutive levels were unaffected by the variations in ethanol and  concentrations. A cyclopropane fatty acid accounted for 2.6-6.4 wt % of the total fatty acids in all treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27372435>Radical formation in the FMN-photosensitized reactions of unsaturated fatty acids bearing double bonds at different positions.</a></h2><p>Although the reaction mechanisms through which flavin mononucleotide works as an endogenous photosensitizer have been investigated (Baier et al., 2006; Edwards and Silva, 2001; Pajares et al., 2001; Criado et al., 2003; Massad et al., 2008) [23-27], few studies have been performed for the reactions of flavin mononucleotide with unsaturated fatty acids. To examine the reactions of flavin mononucleotide with unsaturated fatty acids bearing a double bond at different positions, an electron spin resonance, a high performance liquid chromatography-electron spin resonance and a high performance liquid chromatography-electron spin resonance-mass spectrometry were employed. The control reaction mixtures contained 25μmolL(-1) of flavin mononucleotide, 1.0mmolL(-1) of FeSO4(NH4)2SO4, 10mmolL(-1) of cholic acid, 30mmolL(-1) of phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.1molL(-1) of α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone in deuterium oxide. In addition, it also contained 4.3mmolL(-1) of one of the following: (z)-, (z)-6-octadecenoic acid, (z)-9-octadecenoic acid or (z, z)-9, 12-octadecadienoic acid. The control reaction mixtures without FeSO4(NH4)2SO4 and α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone were exposed to the visible light at 436nm (7.8Jcm(-2)). After the irradiation, α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone was added. The reactions started from adding FeSO4(NH4)2SO4 and performed at 25°C for 1min. Electron spin resonance measurements of the control reaction mixtures showed prominent signals (α(N)=1.58mT and α(Hβ)=0.26mT). High performance liquid chromatography-electron spin resonance analyses of the control reaction mixtures showed prominent peaks at the retention times of 31.1min {(z)-6-octadecenoic acid}, 39.6min {(z)-9-octadecenoic acid}, 44.9min {(z)-} and 40.2min {(z, z)-9, 12-octadecadienoic acid}. High performance liquid chromatography-electron spin resonance-mass analyses of the control reaction mixtures showed that 4-carboxybutyl, 7-carboxyheptyl and 9-carboxynonyl radicals formed in the control reaction mixtures of (z)-6-octadecenoic acid, (z)-9-octadecenoic acid {or (z, z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid} and (z)-, respectively. The 4-carboxybutyl, 7-carboxyheptyl and 9-carboxynonyl radicals are all generated through β-scission of alkoxy radicals formed on carboxyl ends of the double bonds of the unsaturated fatty acids. Thus, we could reveal reactive sites of unsaturated fatty acids in the photosensitized reaction of flavin mononucleotide with unsaturated fatty acids bearing a double bond at different positions.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here, kinetics of heterogeneous reaction of ozone with six unsaturated fatty acids (oleic acid, , eladic acid, myristoleic acid, palmitoleic acid and 2-hexadecenoic acid) were studied via a flow system combined with attenuated total reflection Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Pseudo-first-order rate constants (k) and overall reactive uptake coefficients (γ) values were derived according to the changes in absorbance from infrared spectra. Results have shown reaction rates are highly dependent on structures of unsaturated fatty acids. Cis-isomer has faster reaction kinetics than trans-isomer, and conjugated system between CC and CO bonds can greatly inhibit reactivity. Also, it is found that a longer carbon chain length between CC bond and COOH group or a shorter chain length between CC bond and last carbon seemingly enhances reaction kinetics. In addition, changes in redox activity and hydrophilicity of oleic acid samples before and after exposure ozone have been reported for the first time. Results have revealed that ozone-initiated heterogeneous reaction can markedly increase redox activity and hydrophilicity of unsaturated carboxylic acids.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To test this, porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cells were exposed to 95% O2 at 1 atmosphere absolute (ATA) in the presence or absence of cis  (CVA), a monounsaturated fatty acid (C18:1#11). Plasma membrane fluidity was assessed by fluorescence spectroscopy, plasma membrane lipid composition was quantitated using thin layer and gas chromatography, and cytotoxicity was monitored by measuring release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Hyperoxia caused peroxidation of membrane lipids and decreased fluidity in three distinct lipid domains within the plasma membrane. Incubation with CVA was associated with a reduction in the degree of unsaturation of the constituent fatty acids within all plasma membrane lipid subclasses except monoglycerides. CVA-treated cells were also more resistant to hyperoxic injury as judged by LDH release. These results support the hypothesis that cells with membranes in which the fatty acyl chains are more resistant to the disordering effects of high O2 tensions may be more resistant to O2 toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30732887>Fatty acid levels alterations in THP-1 macrophages cultured with lead (Pb).</a></h2><p>As cardiovascular events are one of the main causes of death in developed countries, each factor potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease deserves special attention. One such factor is the potentially atherogenic effect of lead (Pb) on , and is significant in view of the still considerable Pb environmental pollution and the non-degradability of Pb compounds.Analysis of saturated fatty acids (SFA) (caprylic acid (C8:0), decanoic acid (C10:0), lauric acid (C12:0), tridecanoic acid (C13:0), myristic acid (C14:0), pentadecanoic acid (C15:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), heptadecanoic acid (C17:0), stearic acid (C18:0), and behenic acid (C22:0)), monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) (palmitoleic acid (C16:1), oleic acid (18:1w9), trans- (C18:1 trans11)), and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (linoleic acid (C18:2n6), gamma-linolenic acid (C18:3n6), arachidonic acid (C20:4n6)), was conducted by gas chromatography. Analysis of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1) and fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) expression was performed using qRT-PCR. Oxidative stress intensity (malondialdehyde - MDA concentration) was measured using spectrophotometric method. Intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in macrophages was visualized by fluorescence microscopy and quantitatively measured by plate reader.Pb caused quantitative alterations in FAs profile in macrophages; the effect was Pb-concentration dependent and selective (i.e. concerned only selected FAs). In general, the effect of Pb was biphasic, with Pb levels of 1.25 μg/dL and 2.5 μg/dL being stimulatory, and 10 μg/dL being inhibitory on concentrations of selected FAs. The most potent Pb concentration, resulting in increase in levels of 9 FAs, was 2.5 μg/dL, the Pb-level corresponding to the mean blood Pb concentrations of people living in urban areas not contaminated by Pb. Pb was found to exert similar, biphasic effect on the expression of FADS1. However, Pb decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the expression of SCD and FADS2. Pb significantly increased MDA and ROS concentration in macrophages.Environmental Pb exposure might be a risk factor resulting in alterations in FAs levels, oxidative stress and increased MDA concentration in macrophages, which might lead to the formation of foam cells and to inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Because vascular endothelial cells have been demonstrated to be sensitive cellular targets in oxidant-induced lung injury, we evaluated the effects of a supplemental fatty acid on the lipid composition and oxidant susceptibility of pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) in monolayer culture. PAEC were incubated in culture medium supplemented with an ethanolic solution of 0.1 mM cis- (CVA), an 18-carbon monounsaturated fatty acid, or with the ethanol vehicle alone for 3 h. Cells were then exposed to either control or oxidant (hyperoxia: 95% O2; or hydrogen peroxide: 100 microM) conditions. Oxidant-induced cell injury was assessed by phase-contrast microscopy and by measuring the release of intracellular lactate dehydrogenase. Incubation with CVA increased the CVA content of PAEC lipids and protected cells from oxidant-induced injury for up to 72 h after supplementation. CVA had no effect on nonoxidant-induced cell injury. Although the mechanism by which CVA protects cells against oxidant injury remains undefined, evidence is presented that indicates the mechanism does not involve induction of antioxidant enzyme activity, alterations in the physical state of PAEC membranes, or enhancement of PAEC nucleic acid repair mechanisms. These results define a useful model for exploring the relationship between lipid composition and oxidant susceptibility and suggest that fatty acid modifications may constitute an important strategy for protecting cells against oxidant injury.</p></html>
