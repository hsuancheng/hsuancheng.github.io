<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29706245>Non-invasive bioluminescence imaging as a standardized assessment measure in mouse models of dermal inflammation.</a></h1><p>Myeloperoxidase is used as a marker and diagnostic tool for inflammatory processes. Hypochlorous  produced by myeloperoxidase oxidizes luminol to produce light. By injecting luminol into experimental animals, inflammatory processes can be tracked in real-time by bioluminescence imaging (BLI).We aimed to establish BLI as a standardized assessment measure in three mouse models of dermal inflammation.Oxazolone-induced delayed-type-hypersensitivity (DTH) (acute), a model for dermatitis, imiquimod (IMQ) (sub-chronic) model for  and the (chronic) bleomycin model for scleroderma were used. In the first two models, dexamethasone and clobetasol, respectively, were used as reference compounds. In all cases, classical readouts such as dermal swelling, severity scores and histological analyses were compared with in- vivo bioluminescence.In DTH, bioluminescence peaked earlier than ear swelling, reflecting early cell infiltration. Dexamethasone blocked both ear swelling and bioluminescence. In the IMQ model, bioluminescence closely reflected the  scores and histology and revealed a relapse-remitting course of the disease. Clobetasol partially decreased the disease severity. After stopping IMQ and clobetasol treatment, BLI adopted a rhythmic pattern during resolution. Bleomycin induced an increase in bioluminescence and in collagen thickness. BLI revealed a time-course of the effects of bleomycin that was not reflected by histology alone.For drug discovery and translational purposes, it is important that disease processes be tracked in vivo and possibly over a long period. We conclude that BLI is a valuable and reliable method for in-vivo measurement of dermal inflammation and potentially for inflammation resolution.Copyright © 2018 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

Our understanding of the etiology of this disease remains incomplete. Conventionally,  has been viewed as a condition that manifests solely in the skin. However, the systemic inflammatory nature of this disease has been confirmed by the presence of a wide array of dysregulated cytokines and inflammatory markers in the serum of these patients. Both dysregulated gut and skin microbiomes have been found in association with . An evident association also exists between inflammatory bowel disease and this condition. Regarding the skin microbiome, changes have been observed in the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. Additionally,  and  spp. were detected more frequently in lesional skin. Alterations in the gut microbiome have been characterized by a decrease in the Bacteroidetes phylum and an increase in the  genus. We suggest that dysbiosis of the skin and gut microbiota may contribute to , by promoting the translocation of microbes from these sites into the bloodstream. Consistent with the Iron Dysregulation and Dormant Microbes hypothesis, these microorganisms are in a physiologically dormant state, but may be awakened periodically and shed their cell wall components, such as lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic . Both of these inflammagens may contribute significantly to maintaining a chronic inflammatory state in the host, such as is seen in individuals diagnosed with .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573271>Structure-based drug designing and identification of Woodfordia fruticosa inhibitors targeted against heat shock protein (HSP70-1) as suppressor for Imiquimod-induced  like skin inflammation in mice model.</a></h1><p>Heat shock proteins (HSPs) emerged as a therapeutic target and it was observed that inhibition of HSP70-1 plays a pivotal role in the management of . In-silico investigation involving techniques like molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis was performed against HSP70-1. Further, anti-psoriatic activity of bioactive immunomodulatory compounds present in ethanolic extract of Woodfordia fruticosa flowers (Wffe) using combination of bioinformatics together with ethnopharmacological approach has been explored in this study. Myricetin (-8.024), Quercetin (-7.368) and Ellagic  (-7.311) were the top three compounds with minimum energy levels as well as high therapeutic value/ADMET as compared to currently available marketed anti-psoriatic drug Tretinoin (-7.195). ADMET prediction was used to screen ligands for drug-likeness and efficacy. Further, biogenically Woodfordia fruticosa gold nanoparticles (WfAuNPs) were synthesized and characterized by UV-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-vis), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Zeta Potential, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) techniques. Synthesized WfAuNPs observed in the size range of 10-20 nm and were used to develop WfAuNPs-Carbopol®934 ointment gel. Subsequently, the therapeutic efficacy of WfAuNPs-Carbopol® 934 was checked against 5% Imiquimod-induced  like skin inflammation. WfAuNPs-Carbopol® 934 was found to be exerting better therapeutic effect in reducing the mean DAI score (0.63 ± 0.08), serum cytokines (TNF-α, IL-22 and IL-23) levels along with reduced epidermal thickness, parakeratosis and marked decrease in the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes.

Nevertheless, the low permeability of drugs in the nail plaque precludes the efficacy of local treatments. The use of penetration enhancers can increase drug permeability and improve the efficacy of the treatment of nail pathologies. In this work, different chemical substances have been evaluated as potential penetration enhancers. With this aim, the effect of different substances such as sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG 300), carbocysteine, -acetylcysteine, lactic , potassium phosphate, Labrasol® and Labrafil® in the microstructure, nail surface and drug permeability has been evaluated. The models obtained by mercury intrusion porosimetry and PoreXpert™ software show a more porous structure in nails treated with different enhancers. Permeation studies with bovine hooves and nails revealed that all the hydroalcoholic lacquers developed, and particularly those prepared with SLS, provide better nail penetration of the drugs ciclopirox olamine and clobetasol propionate. Results have shown that the increase of the drug penetration in the nail is caused by the formation of a porous random microstructure and by the decrease of the contact angle between lacquers and the surface or the nail plaque. The presence of SLS produces an improvement in the spreading of the solution on the nail surface and promotes the penetration of the solution into the nail pores. The hydroalcoholic lacquer, elaborated with cyclodextrin/poloxamer soluble polypseudorotaxane and sodium lauryl sulfate as an enhancer, allowed the rate of diffusion and penetration of the active ingredient within the nail to be significantly higher than obtained with the reference lacquers when using either ciclopirox olamine or clobetasol propionate as the active ingredient.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30073694>Clinical and histological spectrum of nail : A cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>Nail  can pose diagnostic difficulties as there are several close clinical mimickers, including onychomycosis, lichen planus, and even squamous cell carcinoma. In view of differing treatment and prognostic implications, it is important to make an accurate diagnosis, especially in cases with isolated nail involvement.Sixty consecutive patients with nail changes suggestive of  were included. A nail punch biopsy was performed and histopathological features were recorded for each case and percentage positivity of each individual feature was calculated. Periodic -Schiff (PAS) stain was performed to detect any fungal colonization or invasion.The most common clinical nail change was distal onycholysis (93.3% patients), followed by subungual hyperkeratosis (80%). On histological examination, the feature found most frequently was hyperkeratosis with parakeratosis (78% of biopsies), followed by neutrophilic infiltration of nail bed epithelium (63%), and hypergranulosis (58%). Unlike  elsewhere, nail bed and matrix histopathology revealed hypergranulosis in more than half of the cases.

The cause of  appears multifactorial, and no unified mitigating signal or single antigenic target has been identified to date. Metabolomic studies hold great potential for explaining disease mechanism, facilitating early diagnosis, and identifying potential therapeutic areas. Here, we present an integrated disease metabolomic biomarker discovery strategy that combines mechanism-based biomarker discovery with clinical sample-based metabolomic profiling. We applied this strategy in identifying and understanding metabolite biomarkers for . The key innovation of our strategy is a novel mechanism-based metabolite prediction system, mmPredict, which assimilates vast amounts of existing knowledge of diseases and metabolites. mmPredict first constructed a -specific mouse mutational phenotype profile. It then constructed phenotype profiles for a total of 259,170 chemicals/metabolites using known chemical genetics and human metabolomic data. Metabolites were then prioritized based on the phenotypic similarities between disease- and metabolites. We evaluated mmPredict using 150 metabolites identified using our in-house metabolome profiling study of  patient samples. mmPredict found 96 of the 150 metabolites and ranked them highly (recall: 0.64, mean ranking: 8.73%, median ranking: 2.33%, p-value: 4.75E-44). These results show that mmPredict is consistent with, as well as a complement to, traditional human metabolomic profiling studies. We then developed a strategy to combine outputs from both systems and found that the oxidative product of linoleic , 13(S)-hydroxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic  (13- HODE), ranked highly by both mmPredict and our in-house experiments. Our integrated analysis indicates that 13- HODE may be a mechanistic link between  and cardiovascular comorbidities associated with . In summary, we developed an integrated metabolomic prediction system that combines both human metabolomic studies and mechanism-based prediction and demonstrated its application in the skin disease . Our system is highly general and can be applied to other diseases when patient-based metabolomic profiling data becomes more increasingly available.

Their physicochemical properties for transdermal delivery of luteolin inhibiting the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes in  were investigated and drug release studies were performed. Double networks of HA/PNIPAM IPN hydrogel were identified through FT-IR and CNMR. By measuring the swelling ratios pH and temperature sensitivity were confirmed, and it was influenced by the content of a cross-linking agent. As a result of texture analysis and rheometry, a IPN hydrogel with 3% crosslinker content had the most adhesive and stable cross-linked network. Therefore, luteolin was loaded on this hydrogel. Its drug release behavior was determined at various temperatures and pH using several drug release kinetic models. As a result of skin permeation study, HA/PNIPAM IPN hydrogel effectively delivers luteolin to the epidermis and dermis. No toxicity was observed as a result of observing cytotoxicity of the hydrogel for application to the skin. In conclusion, IPN hydrogels can be developed as carriers of transdermal delivery system of luteolin for  skin relief.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Considerable effort has been put forth to identify proteins that comprise the hair cell mechanotransduction apparatus. TMC1, a member of the transmembrane channel-like (TMC) family, was identified as a core protein of the mechanotransduction complex in hair cells. However, the inability of TMC1 to traffic through the endoplasmic reticulum in heterologous cellular systems has hindered efforts to characterize its function and fully identify its role in mechanotransduction. We developed a novel approach that allowed for the detection of uncharacterized protein regions, which preclude trafficking to the plasma membrane (PM) in heterologous cells. Tagging N-terminal fragments of TMC1 with Aquaporin 3 (AQP3) and GFP fusion reporter, which intrinsically label PM in HEK293 cells, indicated that residues at the edges of amino  sequence 138-168 invoke intracellular localization and/or degradation. This signal is able to preclude surface localization of PM protein AQP3 in HEK293 cells. Substitutions of the residues by alanine or serine corroborated that the information determining the intracellular retention is present within amino  sequence 138-168 of TMC1 N-terminus. This novel signal may preclude the proper trafficking of TMC1 to the PM in heterologous cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31537243>[Esculentoside reduces expression of Th17 cell-related cytokines in the imiquimod-induced -like dermatitis mouse model].</a></h1><p>Objective To observe the effect of esculentoside A (EsA) on Th17 cell-related factors in -like mouse model. Methods A total of 48 female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into blank control group, model group, Tuiyin decoction group [66.60 g/(kg.d)], low-, middle- and high-dose groups of EsA [5, 10, 20 mg/(kg.d), respectively], 8 mice in each group.  mouse model was induced by imiquimod. Pathological changes of skin lesions in mice were assessed by  area and severity index (PASI) and HE staining. ELISA was used to detect the changes of interleukin-17 (IL-17), IL-22, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Results Compared with the model group, the skin lesions, pathological changes and PASI scores were improved after the treatments with either Tuiyin decoction or EsA, among which the PASI score of Tuiyin decoction group and high-dose group of EsA decreased significantly. The expression of Th17 cell-related factors of the model group was obviously higher than that of the blank control group. Each treated group had obviously lower expression than the model group, and the expression of IL-6 of high-dose group of EsA was close to the blank control group.

Its treatment is challenging, and little is known about the sustainability of different medications. The aim of this study was to analyze drug survival rates and drug discontinuation in the treatment of PPP under real-world conditions.Patients with PPP treated in the dermatology departments of five German university medical centers between 01/2005 and 08/2017 were included in our retrospective study. Drug survival of systemic therapies was assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate regression.Overall, 347 patients with 935 treatment courses were identified. Within the group of non-biologic systemic agents, apremilast showed the highest median drug survival (15 months), followed by cyclosporine (12 months), the combination of acitretin and topical PUVA (9 months), MTX (8 months), acitretin monotherapy (6 months), alitretinoin (5 months), and fumaric  esters (3 months). Among biologicals, the highest maintenance rate was detected for certolizumab pegol (restricted mean: 47.4 months), followed by infliximab (median: 26 months), golimumab (22 months), ustekinumab (21 months), adalimumab (18 months), secukinumab (9 months), and etanercept (8 months).Biologicals and apremilast may serve as second-line options for treatment of PPP and should be further evaluated.© 2019 Deutsche Dermatologische Gesellschaft (DDG).

Patients with no response to a first induction treatment are typically switched to another, and some patients require several treatments before they see an improvement.To determine the most cost-effective sequence of induction treatment through a comparative time-effectiveness analysis of different systemic treatment sequences currently licensed in Germany for moderate to severe plaque .This time-effectiveness analysis used a decision-analytic model set in the German health care system. The population simulated to receive the treatment sequences consisted of adult men and women with  vulgaris or plaque type  eligible for systemic treatment. Systematic reviews were performed to generate model input values. Data were collected from November 1 through December 15, 2017, and analyzed from January through August 2018.Five treatment sequences frequently used in Germany, identified through an online expert survey (response rate, 10 of 15 [66.7%]), and 4 theoretical sequences starting with a biological agent. Treatments included methotrexate sodium (MTX), cyclosporine (CSA), fumaric  esters (FAE), adalimumab (ADA), ixekizumab (IXE), infliximab (INF), and secukinumab (SEC).Two health states were defined: responder (patients achieving a  Area Severity Index [PASI] ≥75) and nonresponder (PASI <75). Probability values were defined as response rates of PASI-75. Treatment effects were determined by the mean change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score. Time until onset of action was assessed as weeks until 25% of patients reach PASI-75. Individual time-effectiveness ratios were calculated per treatment sequence as time until onset of action (in weeks) per minimally important difference (MID) in DLQI and were subsequently ranked.Treatment sequences starting with a biological agent, including IXE-INF-SEC (1.4 weeks per DLQI-MID), INF-IXE-SEC (2.05 weeks per DLQI-MID), SEC-IXE-ADA (2.1 weeks per DLQI-MID), and ADA-IXE-SEC (2.8 weeks per DLQI-MID) were more time-effective than frequently used treatment sequences, including MTX-SEC-ADA (6.8 weeks per DLQI-MID), MTX-ADA-IXE (7.0 weeks per DLQI-MID), MTX-ADA-SEC (7.2 weeks per DLQI-MID), MTX-FAE-ADA (10.05 weeks per DLQI-MID), and FAE-MTX-CSA (11.5 weeks per DLQI-MID). The results were robust to deterministic sensitivity analyses.When allocating monetary resources, policy makers and regulators may want to consider time until patients experience an MID in their quality of life as an additional outcome measure.PROSPERO Identifier: CRD42017074218.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913494>Enhanced skin permeation of Methotrexate from penetration enhancer containing vesicles: In vitro optimization and in vivo evaluation.</a></h1><p>Low dose Methotrexate (MTX) therapy is considered a gold standard for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Transdermal drug delivery is hypothesized as an alternative to conventional therapies to alleviate its adverse effects. In our study, MTX was entrapped in deformable liposomes and loaded in a hydroxyethyl cellulose gel. This system was evaluated by the Box Behnken statistical design for optimization. The effect of formulation variables on particle size, entrapment and ex vivo skin permeation was studied. The MTX nanogel was evaluated for its dermal toxicity (acute and repeat dose safety), in vivo biodistribution (using I radio-labelled MTX) and therapeutic efficacy (collagen induced arthritis [CIA] model). The optimized formulation demonstrated appreciable nanosize (110 ± 20 nm), drug entrapment (42 ± 1.9%) and high ex vivo transdermal flux (17.37 ± 1.5 μg/cm2/hr). In the dermal toxicity studies, nanogel formulation did not show any signs of irritation or toxicity, whereas in the biodistribution study, the MTX nanogel formulation depicted sustained systemic delivery up to 48 h with low accumulation in its organs of toxicity such as the liver, kidneys and gut. In the CIA model, the MTX nanogel significantly ameliorated hind paw swelling, reduced arthritic score, joint damage (histological, radiological examination) and attenuated the rise in serum cytokines such as TNF-ɑ and IL-6. In conclusion, the optimized MTX nanogel formulation displayed skin biocompatibility, sustained systemic delivery, safety as well as therapeutic efficacy.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Chemokine recognition site 1 (CRS1) encompasses interactions between the CKR N-terminus and the globular chemokine core. Chemokine recognition site 2 (CRS2) includes interactions between the unstructured chemokine N-terminus and the binding pocket of the receptor. The two-step/two-site paradigm has been an adequate framework to study the intricacies of chemokine:CKR interactions, but emerging studies highlight the limitations of this model. Here, we present studies of CRS2 interactions between the chemokine CCL20 and its cognate receptor CCR6 driven by the hypothesis that CCL20 interacts with CCR6 as described by the two-step/two-site model. CCL20 is a chemokine with an unusually short N-terminus of 5 residues (NH -ASNFD), compared to the average length of 10 residues for chemokine ligands. We have investigated how well CCL20 tolerates manipulation of the N-terminus by monitoring binding affinity of variants and their ability to activate the receptor. We show the CCL20 N-terminus tolerates truncation of up to 3 residues, extension by up to 5 additional residues, and point mutations at 4 of 5 positions with minimal loss of binding affinity and minimal impairment in ability to stimulate calcium mobilization, inositol triphosphate accumulation, chemotaxis, and β-arrestin-2 recruitment.

Recent studies have revealed that IL-17-producing γδ T cells (γδ17 cells) in addition to IL-17-producing CD4 T cells [T helper type 17 (Th17) cells] are often the main producers of IL-17 in mouse models of inflammatory diseases. γδ T cells are functionally committed during intra-thymic differentiation. γδ thymocytes capable of producing IL-17, which express the transcription factor retinoic--receptor-related orphan receptor γt and the signature cytokine receptor IL-23R, leave the thymus, and produce IL-17 rapidly by the stimulation with IL-1β and IL-23 in the periphery. Therefore, γδ17 cells play important roles in the early phase of host defence against pathogens and in inflammatory diseases. γδ T cells that can produce IL-17 are also increased in the skin of patients with  and in peripheral blood of patients with ankylosing sclerosis. Indeed, the therapy targeting IL-17 has been approved or is in clinical trials, and proved to be very efficient to treat , psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing sclerosis. In this review, we discuss recent knowledge about the pathophysiological function of γδ17 cells in infection and inflammatory diseases and therapeutic advances targeting IL-17.© 2018 The Authors.

Patients have high expectations about the speed at which improvement is achieved, which then can have a marked impact on the patient's adherence to treatment. Recently, clinical data on a new fixed combination of halobetasol and tazarotene (HP/TAZ) have been presented. HP/TAZ lotion was statistically more effective than individual active ingredients or its vehicle, with a predictable safety profile.Here we review the efficacy and tolerability data with a specific focus on the first two weeks of therapy.Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 2 study in moderate or severe  (N=212). Subjects randomized (2:2:2:1 ratio) to receive halobetasol 0.01%/tazarotene 0.045% (HP/TAZ), individual active ingredients (HP or TAZ), or vehicle, once-daily for 8 weeks. Efficacy assessments included treatment success (defined as at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline in the IGA score and a score of 'clear' or 'almost clear'), and impact on individual signs of  (erythema, plaque elevation, and scaling) at the target lesion.As early as 2 weeks, HP/TAZ lotion demonstrated statistically significant superiority for treatment success over vehicle (P equals 0.047) and TAZ (P equals 0.029). By week 2, 47.5% of patients were 'mild', 'almost clear' or 'clear' compared with 33.3%, 16.9%, and 12.9% of patients treated with HP, TAZ, or vehicle, respectively; plaque elevation and scaling were significantly improved compared with HP, TAZ, or vehicle, and erythema was significantly improved compared with TAZ. Improvements in baseline itching (45.6%), dryness (42.2%), burning/stinging (55.9%) with HP/TAZ lotion at 2 weeks were similar to those seen with HP, and greater than that achieved with TAZ (30.8% [P equals 0.099], 35.4%, and 13.3%, respectively).The HP/TAZ fixed combination lotion provides rapid relief of  symptoms, with apparent benefits over both HP and TAZ by week 2.

Serious adverse events were reported in 2.3% of patients, but none were deemed to have a causal relationship with any of the treatment regimens. Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were observed in 12.9% of patients. A median duration of 1 year was observed in all three treatment subcohorts (P = 0.70) from initiation of FAE treatment to a 50% response rate, where response was defined as achieving a cumulative static Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score of 'light' and at least a 2-point reduction in baseline PGA. A 50% response rate for the cumulative  Area and Severity Index 75 was achieved in the FAE monotherapy subcohort after a median of 3 years of treatment, in the FAEs + phototherapy subcohort after 6.7 years and in the FAEs + methotrexate subcohort after 8.1 years (P = 0.001).According to our data, FAEs as monotherapy or in combination with phototherapy or methotrexate are safe and beneficial for long-term clinical use. However, multicentre, randomized controlled trials are required to establish the clinical value of monotherapy versus combination therapy and the optimal treatment duration.© 2018 The Authors.

In previous studies, we have explored various markers in plasma and serum to characterize the ongoing systemic inflammation in  patients compared to controls. We have identified several markers that were altered in  patients, but which all were unresponsive to narrowband UVB (NB-UVB) treatment.The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of NB-UVB treatment on markers of cardiovascular risk and systemic inflammation in .The levels of 17 potential biomarkers with an association with cardiovascular risk were quantitated in plasma from 37 age- and gender-matched  patients and controls at baseline and in 21  patients after 12 weeks of NB-UVB treatment to identify a systemic treatment response.We identified the mediators endocan-1, CXCL16, and sVEGFR1, which were systemically decreased in  at baseline, as well as FABP3, FABP4, and sIL-1R1, which showed normal baseline levels.

Dysbiosis may cause disruption of the intestinal barrier, which contributes to immune activation by translocation of microbial antigens and metabolites. Intestinal fatty  binding protein (I-FABP) serves as a biomarker of enterocyte damage. The aim of this study was to investigate clinical and metabolic factors affecting plasma concentration of I-FABP in patients with . Eighty patients with  and 40 control subjects were enrolled in the study.

Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation shifts intracellular metabolism toward glycolysis, while anti-inflammatory signals depend on enhanced mitochondrial respiration. How exogenous metabolic signals affect the immune response is unknown. We demonstrate that TLR-dependent responses of dendritic cells (DCs) are exacerbated by a high-fatty- (FA) metabolic environment. FAs suppress the TLR-induced hexokinase activity and perturb tricarboxylic  cycle metabolism. These metabolic changes enhance mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production and, in turn, the unfolded protein response (UPR), leading to a distinct transcriptomic signature with IL-23 as hallmark. Interestingly, chemical or genetic suppression of glycolysis was sufficient to induce this specific immune response. Conversely, reducing mtROS production or DC-specific deficiency in XBP1 attenuated IL-23 expression and skin inflammation in an IL-23-dependent model of . Thus, fine-tuning of innate immunity depends on optimization of metabolic demands and minimization of mtROS-induced UPR.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Our lives are dependent on the functioning of buffer systems. A buffer system is a solution that resists a change in pH when  or bases are added. The skin possesses a fairly high buffer capacity, which is determined by the amount of H+ or OH- ions that is needed until the pH value of a solution changes by the unit 1. Buffers contain a weak or medium strong  (base) and the corresponding salt. Buffers that show a pKa in the range of the Stratum corneum surface pH are most important for the skin. Buffer capacity is reduced both in baby skin and in aged skin. External factors, water, and detergent may reduce the local buffer capacity because of the elution of buffer chemicals leading to increased pH and irritative contact dermatitis. Inflammatory diseases, including atopic dermatitis, , and acne vulgaris, which show an increased pH should probably also have reduced buffer capacities. For the treatment of the skin diseases and in aged skin, emollient with a pH that is slightly more acidic than the average normal pH and an appropriate buffer capacity should be preferably used.© 2018 S.

Dysfunction of immune cells, such as T cells, mast cells, and basophils, is involved. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin polysaccharide nucleic  (BCG-PSN), an immunomodulator partially extracted from BCG, can be used in the combined treatment of CSU with an unknown mechanism.To study the therapeutic effect and mechanism of BCG-PSN on CSU, we initially assessed the clinical efficacy in 110 enrolled CSU patients of 4-week antihistamine monotherapy vs. antihistamine plus BCG-PSN combined therapy. Subsequently, to explore the further mechanism of BCG-PSN, the mast cell line RBL-2H3 pretreated with BCG-PSN was used to evaluate the transcriptional expression profiles via lncRNA sequencing. Real time PCR was conducted to validate the candidate gene expression.We found no significant difference in treatment efficacy between the BCG-PSN group (71.7%) and the monotherapy group (71.9%). However, the average time of complete relief in the BCG-PSN group was significantly shorter than that in the monotherapy group (36.77 ± 17.33 vs. 51.27 ± 16.80,  = 0.026).  experiments showed that BCG-PSN inhibited β-hexosaminidase release rates in IgE-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells ( < 0.001). Sequencing data revealed the expression profiles of functional genes, including a significant decrease in Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4, which can be regulated by the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway.CSU is a chronic, recurrent disease with complex pathogenesis. Mast cells and basophils are the primary target cells of the disease. BCG-PSN decrease the β-HEX release rates and regulated IgE-mediated mast cell activation in RBL-2H3 cells by mediating immune-related gene expression including ERBB4. These findings suggest that BCG-PSN may mediate ERBB4 expression  the NF-κB pathway and may have value in the treatment of CSU.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30507131>A Drug with Lipophilicity-Dependent Potency Can Be Metabolically Stable: Discovery of a Potent and Selective Retinoic  Receptor-Related Orphan Receptor C2 (RORC2) Inverse Agonist as an Orally Bioavailable Anti-Inflammatory Agent.</a></h1><p>IL-17 drives an amplification mechanism in inflammatory diseases such as , psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was (1) to standardize the extraction protocol and (2) to investigate FAA profiles in healthy young and healthy old volunteers, as well as in  and atopic dermatitis patients.Skin samples were collected from four groups (healthy young, healthy old, and  and atopic dermatitis patients) with 5 volunteers per group. Corneocytes were isolated and examined microscopically. FAAs and urea were extracted from the isolated corneocytes, and their amounts were quantified using LC-ESI/MS/MS (after derivatization with Fmoc-Cl) and colorimetric methods, respectively.The micrographs of the corneocytes showed no morphological features attributable to age or disease conditions. The highest and lowest concentrations of total FAAs and urea were observed in the healthy old group and the healthy young group, respectively. Unlike the other FAAs and urea, citrulline was found at a higher level in the healthy young group than in the disease groups.This study suggests that the levels of FAAs and urea in the skin are affected by age and skin conditions (healthy/diseased).

Retinoids are commonly used in therapy of acneiform skin diseases. In vitro, retinoids elicit antagonistic effects on keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation, as compared to TCDD, suggesting their potential in treatment of TCDD-induced skin lesions. Nevertheless, the modulation of TCDD activity in skin by retinoids in vivo was never reported. We have used N-TERT keratinocyte cell line and hairless (hr) mice to determine if retinoic  (RA) can lessen or reverse TCDD-induced effects in vitro and in vivo. RA co-treatment suppressed TCDD-induced changes in the expression of differentiation-associated genes and N-TERT keratinocyte viability in vitro. However, in hairless mice (in vivo), RA/TCDD co-treatment produced more severe effects, than treatment with either of the two compounds individually. RA/TCDD co-application to mouse skin strongly stimulated keratinocyte proliferation, resulting in dramatic epidermal hyperplasia. It has also led to massive immune cell infiltration into the dermis, and increased mRNA expression of inflammation markers, including IL1β, IL6 and S100A7. Thus, retinoids not only appeared ineffective in treatment of TCDD-induced skin lesions in hairless mice, but also resulted in their exaggeration. These in vivo results question previous cell culture-based claims that RA may reduce TCDD-induced skin effects and caution against the reliance on in vitro data in TCDD toxicology research.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Usually, patients with chronic cholestasis exhibit lower serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels. But those patients receiving PUVA for  showed an increase in serum 25(OH)D levels, probably highlighting that the vitamin D-vitamin D nuclear receptor (VD-VDR) axis play a protective role in 8-MOP-induced hepatotoxicity. The present study confirmed 8-MOP could increase serum 25(OH)D levels in conventional lighting and diet (CLD) and vitamin D deficient (VDD) Sprague-Dawley rats. Potential liver risks were also found in CLD and VDD rats after 8-MOP treatment. We proved that 8-MOP could be a potent ligand for VDR using molecular docking and luciferase report assay. Effect of 8-MOP on VDR subcellular distribution was determined using human liver cell line L02. We found 8-MOP could increase VDR protein expression in the nuclear and cytosol extracts and also total cell extracts in L02. siRNAs for VDR were used to determine the role of VDR in protecting 8-MOP-induced cholestasis and potential cellular mechanisms. The results showed 8-MOP could affect the CYP7A1, SHP and MRP3 expression via VDR, and such effects could be reversed by knockdown of VDR expression, suggesting a vital role of VDR involved in 8-MOP-regulated bile  synthesis and transportation. In conclusion, these results revealed activation of VD-VDR axis may play a beneficial role in 8-MOP-mediated regulation of bile  synthesis and transportation.Copyright © 2018.

The abnormal expression level of TREX2 can result in broken chromosome, increased susceptibility to skin carcinogenesis and . However, the molecular mechanisms of how TREX2 binds and processes its natural substrates, dsDNA or chromosomal DNA, to maintain genome stability remain unclear. In this study, we present four new crystal structures: apo-TREX2, TREX2 in complex with two different dsDNA substrates, and TREX2 in complex with a processed dsDNA product. Analysis of the structures reveals that TREX2 stacks with the 5'-terminal of dsDNA by a Leu20-Pro21-Asn22 cluster for precisely trimming the 3'-overhang. In addition, TREX2 specifically interacts with the non-scissile strand of dsDNA by an α-helix-loop region. The unique interaction patterns of the TREX2-dsDNA complex highlight the requirement of long double-stranded region for TREX2 binding and provide evidence of the functional role of TREX2 in processing chromosomal DNA. Moreover, the non-processive property of TREX2 is elucidated by the structure of TREX2-product complex.

Several side effects associated with chronic application of corticosteroids limit its uses. Hence, there is a need to find a safe and effective alternative agent for  treatment.The study aimed to investigate the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of petroleum ether extract of Annona squamosa seeds (ASO) as an antipsoriatic agent. The toxicity profile of ASO and its effect on -induced inflammation has also been determined.Physicochemical characterization was performed to determine constituents of ASO. Anti-proliferative activity of ASO was studied by Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay using HaCaT cell lines. Oxazolone-induced  in female Balb/C mice was used as an animal model for investigating in vivoefficacy of ASO. Inflammatory markers were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining of mice ears. Safety profile of ASO was confirmed by performing acute dose dermal toxicity and repeated dose dermal toxicity testing.Predominant presence of polyunsaturated fatty  viz. linoleic  and oleic  in ASO was confirmed by H NMR, C NMR and GC-MS analysis. The petroleum ether extract of Annona squamosa seeds showed inhibition of cell proliferation of keratinocytes (HaCaT cells). The growth inhibitory property of ASO was significantly higher than that was observed in presence of corticosteroid, clobetasol propionaste (CP). Application of ASO to the ears of Balb/C mice with oxazolone induced  showed marked reduction in erythema and edema, which was comparable to treatment with 0.05% CP cream. The increased levels of cytokines IL6, IL17, TNF-α, INF-γ, GMCSF, and infiltration of CD4 T cells observed in  lesions were decreased upon application of ASO. Acute and repeated dermal toxicity studies of ASO did not reveal any adverse events affirming the safety of ASO.The present data has demonstrated that ASO is a safe and effective anti-psoriatic agent when tested in animal models.

Yet, the medicinal properties of some species still need to be scientifically validated. The present study was designed to investigate into the biological properties of various solvent extracts (ethyl acetate, methanol, and aqueous) of the roots and aerial parts of Scrophularia lucida based on its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and enzyme inhibitory activities together with phytochemical screening. Our results revealed that the solvent extracts differed in their biological effectiveness. The root ethyl acetate extract showed the highest ABTS scavenging, FRAP, CUPRAC, and inhibitory activity against AChE and α-glucosidase. The ethyl acetate extract of the aerial parts displayed the highest BChE and α-amylase inhibition and antioxidant effect in the phosphomolybdenum assay, while the methanol extracts of both parts were the most effective DPPH scavengers and tyrosinase inhibitors. The methanol extracts of the root and aerial parts also inhibited NO production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine leukemic monocyte-macrophage cell (4.99% and 10.77%, respectively), at 31.25 μg/mL concentration. The highest TPC (34.98 mg GAE/g extract) and TFC (48.33 mg RE/g extract) were observed in the ethyl acetate extract of the root and aerial parts, respectively. The most abundant compounds in the root ethyl acetate extract were luteolin (852 μg/g extract), rosmarinic  (522 μg/g extract), and hesperidin (394 μg/g extract) while kaempferol was most abundant in the ethyl acetate extract of the aerial parts (628 μg/g extract). In silico experiments were conducted on tyrosinase and the higher docking values were observed for rosmarinic  and hesperidin. The present findings provide base line information which tend to support the potential use of S. lucida in the management of several chronic diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and diabetes mellitus.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

LTs include the di-hydroxy  LT (LTB4) and the cysteinyl LTs (CysLTs; LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4), all of which are involved in both acute and chronic inflammation. We and other groups identified a high-affinity LTB4 receptor, BLT1; the LTC4 and LTD4 receptors, CysLT1 and CysLT2; and the LTE4 receptor, GPR99. Pharmacological studies have shown that BLT1 signaling stimulates degranulation, chemotaxis and phagocytosis of neutrophils, whereas CysLT1 and CysLT2 signaling induces airway inflammation by increasing vascular permeability and the contraction of bronchial smooth muscle. Recently, we and other groups suggested that the LTB4-BLT1 axis and the cysteinyl LTs-CysLT1/2 axis are involved in chronic inflammatory diseases including asthma, atopic dermatitis, , atherosclerosis, arthritis, obesity, cancer and age-related macular degeneration using animal models for disease and gene knockout mice.

Upon exposure to inflammatory stimuli, macrophages rapidly respond and subsequently undergo metabolic reprogramming to substantially produce cellular metabolites such as itaconate. As a derivate of the tricarboxylic  cycle, itaconate is derived from the decarboxylation of cis-aconitate mediated by immunoresponsive gene 1 in the mitochondrial matrix. It is well known that itaconate has a direct antimicrobial effect by inhibiting isocitrate lyase. Strikingly, two recent studies published in Nature showed that itaconate markedly decreases the production of proinflammatory mediators in lipopolysaccharide-treated macrophages and ameliorates sepsis and  in animal models, revealing a novel biological action of itaconate beyond its regular roles in antimicrobial defense. The mechanism for this anti-inflammatory effect has been proposed to involve the inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase, blockade of IκBζ translation and activation of Nrf2. These intriguing discoveries provide a new explanation for how macrophages are switched from a pro- to an anti-inflammatory state to limit the damage and facilitate tissue repair under proinflammatory conditions. Thus, the emerging effect of itaconate as a crucial determinant of macrophage inflammation has important implications in further understanding cellular immunometabolism and developing future therapeutics for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. In this review, we focus on the roles of itaconate in controlling the inflammatory response during macrophage activation, providing a rationale for future investigation and therapeutic intervention.© 2018 Australasian Society for Immunology Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31376153>A 24-week multicentre, randomised, open-label, parallel-group study comparing the efficacy and safety of ixekizumab to fumaric  esters and methotrexate in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque  naïve to systemic treatment.</a></h1><p>Interleukin-(IL)-17 antagonists have received a first-line label for moderate-to-severe plaque .We conducted the first head-to-head trial between the 2 most commonly used first-line therapies in Germany, fumaric  esters (FAE) and methotrexate, and the IL-17A antagonist, ixekizumab.Systemic-naïve patients were randomised in this parallel-group, active-comparator, open-label, rater-blinded trial (each group N=54).

It is now known that resolution of inflammation is an active process locally controlled by specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), named resolvins (Rvs), protectins, and maresins.It is unknown whether these potent lipid mediators (LMs) are involved in PSO pathophysiology and if the skin and blood have disease-specific SPMs phenotype profiles.We used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based LM metabololipidomics to obtain skin and peripheral blood LM profiles from PSO compared to healthy subjects. Some LMs were tested in cell culture experiments with corresponding gene expression and protein concentration analyses.The levels of several LM were significantly elevated in lesional PSO skin compared to nonlesional and skin from healthy subjects. Particularly, RvD5, protectins Dx, and aspirin-triggered forms of lipoxin were present only in lesional PSO skin, whereas protectin D1 was present in nonlesional PSO skin. To determine specific roles of SPMs on skin-related inflammatory cytokines, RvD1 and RvD5 were incubated with human keratinocytes. RvD1 and RvD5 reduced the expression levels of interleukin 24 and S100A12, whereas only RvD1 significantly abrogated interleukin-24 production by keratinocytes.These findings suggest that an imbalance between locally produced proresolution and proinflammatory LMs identified in PSO skin and blood compartments might play a role in PSO pathophysiology.

It induces protein succination leading to inactivation of cysteine-rich proteins. It was first shown to possess cytoprotective and antioxidant effects in noncancer models, which appeared related to the induction of the nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway. DMF also displays antitumor activity in several cellular and mice models. Recently, we showed that the anticancer mechanism of DMF is dose-dependent and is paradoxically related to the decrease in the nuclear translocation of NRF2. Some other studies performed indicate also the potential role of DMF in cancers, which are dependent on the NRF2 antioxidant and cellular detoxification program, such as KRAS-mutated lung adenocarcinoma. It, however, seems that DMF has multiple biological effects as it has been shown to also inhibit the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), thus blocking downstream targets that may be involved in the development and progression of inflammatory cascades leading to various disease processes, including tumors, lymphomas, diabetic retinopathy, arthritis, and .

The aim of our work was to improve the diagnostics of AP patients taking into account some indicators of the immune-endocrine system and features of the disease course to specify their role in AP pathogenesis and to develop the system of integrated therapy of patients whose locomotor system is affected due to .Materials and methods: A total of 178 AP patients have been systematically examined. We have examined AP patients with varying severity of process development, generalization and the severity of skin and osseous-articular apparatus damage, the presence of associated pathology. Additional instrumental studies, determination of biochemical, serological parameters and an assessment of stress-induced immune-endocrine system have been conducted in AP patients. The content of trigger cytokines (IL-1β, IL-8, IL-17, IL-22) in blood serum, stress hormones (ACTH, cortisol), cellular and humoral immunity condition (CD3 +, CD4 +, CD8 +, CD16 +, CD22 +, IgM and IgG levels) have been studied.Results: The clinical course and characteristic features of AP instrumental tests are extremely versatile as well as the depth of their present study is insufficient. Regardless of the disease duration period, we have detected in blood serum of AP patients probable changes in concentrations of stress-response mediators (decreased parameters of cellular immunity (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ of T-lymphocytes, CD22+ fraction of B-lymphocytes and compensatory increased CD16+ of T-cells, cytokines - IL-1β, IL-8, IL- 17, IL-22, stress hormones - cortisol, immunoglobulins IgM, IgG, and CIC), which indicate tension of their stress-induced mechanisms even despite occasional clinical stabilization of skin and articular process. We have offered and tested regiments to treat AP patients, which involve differential application within the integrated therapy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (Arcoxia 30-60 mg 1 time daily / Naklofen Duo 75 mg daily), disease-modifying medications (Sulfasalazine ЕН from 500 mg to 2 g daily / Methotrexate 7.5-10 mg/week), lyophilised dialysate of leukocytes.Conclusions: The analysis of specific features of the AP clinical course and data of integrated studies allows identifying the probability of manifestation or persistence of the pathological psoriatic articular process. The improvement of AP patients diagnostics taking into account some indicators of the immune-endocrine system and specifics of the disease course contributed to the improved therapy and mended quality of life of patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29874096>Cholesterol Unbound RORγt Protein Enables a Sensitive Inverse Agonist Screening.</a></h1><p>The retinoic -related orphan receptor gamma T (RORγt) plays an important role in Th17 cell proliferation and functionality. Thus, RORγt inverse agonists are thought to be potent therapeutic agents for Th17-mediated autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and . Although RORγt has constitutive activity, it is recognized that the receptor is physiologically regulated by various cholesterol derivatives. In this study, we sought to identify RORγt inverse agonists through a high-throughput screening campaign. To this end, we compared an apo-RORγt protein from Escherichia coli and a cholesterol-bound RORγt protein from insect cells. The IC of the known RORγt inverse agonist TO901317 was significantly lower for the apoprotein than for the cholesterol-bound RORγt. Through high-throughput screening using a fluorescence-based cholesterol binding assay with the apoprotein, we identified compound 1 as a novel cholesterol-competitive RORγt inverse agonist. Compound 1 inhibited the RORγt-TopFluor cholesterol interaction, coactivator recruitment, and transcriptional activity of RORγt. Cell-based reporter gene assay demonstrated that compound 1 showed higher potency by lipid depletion treatment. Collectively, our findings indicate that eliminating cholesterol from the RORγt protein is suitable for sensitive high-throughput screening to identify RORγt inverse agonists.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29915656>A deadly prescription: combination of methotrexate and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.</a></h1><p>Methotrexate (MTX) is a chemotherapeutic synthetic(s) phase cell cycle inhibitor, and its role has evolved as an immunological agent in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, , and systemic lupus erythematosus, etc. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TS) is one of the most widely prescribed antibiotics commonly used for urinary tract infections, exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, traveler's diarrhea, and pneumocystis pneumonia.

Efficacy appears to be dose and formulation dependent, and erythema less responsive. Tazarotene sustains clinical response posttreatment and may have an important role in maintenance therapy. The most common side effect is mild-to-moderate local irritation, which limited its role as a single agent for . Efficacy is enhanced through combination with topical corticosteroids (TCS). Tazarotene may circumvent the problem of TCS tachyphylaxis, due to its sustained efficacy and provide tolerability benefits; tazarotene increases epidermal thickness and may reduce the risk of steroid-induced atrophy. In addition, tazarotene-induced irritation is reduced by the anti-inflammatory effect of TCS. A new fixed combination, well-tolerated tazarotene/halobetasol topical formulation is now available, which provides synergistic efficacy that is both rapid and sustained posttreatment.Tazarotene is a highly effective  treatment whose efficacy and tolerability can be enhanced through combination therapy with TCS, and a new fixed combination topical formulation of tazarotene and halobetasol may provide an optimal management approach.

Resolvins are produced for termination of neutrophil infiltration, stimulation of the clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages, and promotion of tissue remodeling and homeostasis. Metabolic dysregulation due to either uncontrolled activity of pro-inflammatory responses or to inefficient resolution of inflammation results in chronic inflammation and may also lead to atherosclerosis or other chronic autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, , systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis of such diseases involves a complex interplay between the immune system and, environmental factors (non-infectious or infectious), and critically depends on individual susceptibility to such factors. In the present review, resolvins and their roles in the resolution of inflammation, as well as the role of these mediators as potential therapeutic agents to counteract specific chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases are discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042271>Association of Maternal Neurodevelopmental Risk Alleles With Early-Life Exposures.</a></h1><p>Early-life exposures, such as prenatal maternal lifestyle, illnesses, nutritional deficiencies, toxin levels, and adverse birth events, have long been considered potential risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring. However, maternal genetic factors could be confounding the association between early-life exposures and neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring, which makes inferring a causal relationship problematic.To test whether maternal polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for neurodevelopmental disorders were associated with early-life exposures previously linked to the disorders.In this UK population-based cohort study, 7921 mothers with genotype data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) underwent testing for association of maternal PRS for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD PRS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD PRS), and schizophrenia (SCZ PRS) with 32 early-life exposures. ALSPAC data collection began September 6, 1990, and is ongoing. Data were analyzed for the current study from April 1 to September 1, 2018.Maternal ADHD PRS, ASD PRS, and SCZ PRS were calculated using discovery effect size estimates from the largest available genome-wide association study and a significance threshold of P < .05.Outcomes measured included questionnaire data on maternal lifestyle and behavior (eg, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, and maternal age), maternal use of nutritional supplements and medications in pregnancy (eg, acetaminophen, iron, zinc, folic , and vitamins), maternal illnesses (eg, diabetes, hypertension, rheumatism, , and depression), and perinatal factors (eg, birth weight, preterm birth, and cesarean delivery).Maternal PRSs were available from 7921 mothers (mean [SD] age, 28.5 [4.8] years). The ADHD PRS was associated with multiple prenatal factors, including infections (odds ratio [OR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.18), use of acetaminophen during late pregnancy (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.18), lower blood levels of mercury (β coefficient, -0.06; 95% CI, -0.11 to -0.02), and higher blood levels of cadmium (β coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.05-0.09). Little evidence of associations between ASD PRS or SCZ PRS and prenatal factors or of association between any of the PRSs and adverse birth events was found. Sensitivity analyses revealed consistent results.These findings suggest that maternal risk alleles for neurodevelopmental disorders, primarily ADHD, are associated with some pregnancy-related exposures. These findings highlight the need to carefully account for potential genetic confounding and triangulate evidence from different approaches when assessing the effects of prenatal exposures on neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905492>A novel RORγt inhibitor is a potential therapeutic agent for the topical treatment of  with low risk of thymic aberrations.</a></h1><p>Retinoic  receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt) has critical roles in the development, maintenance and function of interleukin (IL)-17-producing cells and is a highly attractive target for the treatment of IL-17-mediated autoimmune disease, particularly .

However, their actual significance and the molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. To address these issues, we focused on resolvin E1 (RvE1), an omega-3 PUFAs-derived metabolite, and examined its effects on psoriatic dermatitis, using an imiquimod-induced mouse  model. RvE1 potently suppressed the inflammatory cell infiltration and epidermal hyperplasia in the psoriatic skin. RvE1 decreased the mRNA expression of IL-23 in the skin. Consistently, RvE1 inhibited IL-23 production by dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro. Furthermore, RvE1 exerted inhibitory effects on migration of cutaneous DCs and γδ T cells, a major IL-17-producing cell population in mouse, both in vivo and in vitro. These suppressive effects of RvE1 were mediated by its antagonistic function on BLT1, a receptor of leukotriene B4, and were also observed in human DCs, Th17 and Tc17 cells.

In some cases, two active ingredients complement each other providing a cumulative or additive effect. In rarer cases, a synergistic effect may be seen where the sum of the two active ingredients combined action is greater than the sum of the efficacy of the constituent parts.To determine whether a novel halobetasol propionate 0.01% and tazarotene 0.045% (HP/TAZ) fixed combination lotion provides a synergistic effect in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque .Post hoc analysis of 212 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque  randomized (2:2:2:1) to HP/TAZ lotion, HP, TAZ or vehicle once-daily for 8 weeks, with a 4-week posttreatment follow-up. Treatment success was evaluated based on two outcomes: percent of patients achieving at least a 2-grade improvement in Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) and IGA score equating to ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’; and percent change from baseline in the IGAxbody surface area (BSA) score, an alternative to assessing response to therapy that is more sensitive to area change than the  Area Severity Index (PASI). In addition, a clinically meaningful outcome was reported in patients who achieved a 75% reduction in IGAxBSA. Synergy was established when the benefit of combination HP/TAZ lotion was greater than benefit of HP plus TAZ, with a ratio (HP/TAZ divided by HP+TAZ) >1.0.HP/TAZ lotion was synergistic at week 8, and four weeks posttreatment. At week 8, treatment success with HP/TAZ lotion relative to vehicle was 42.8% compared with 32.5% for HP plus TAZ (ratio 1.3); and percent change from baseline in IGAxBSA score relative to vehicle was 51.6% compared with 40.6% for HP plus TAZ (ratio 1.3). At week 12, treatment success with HP/TAZ lotion relative to vehicle was 31.3% compared with 20.0% for HP plus TAZ (ratio 1.6). Percent change from baseline in IGAxBSA score relative to vehicle was 47.3% compared with 34.2% for HP plus TAZ (ratio 1.4). HP/TAZ lotion also provided synergistic benefits in terms of achieving a clinically meaningful outcome, with a ratio of 1.3 and 2.0 at weeks 8 and 12.Halobetasol propionate 0.01% and tazarotene 0.045% (HP/TAZ) fixed combination lotion provides a synergistic benefit in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque .

Here we show the anti-inflammatory and anti-psoriatic efficacies of a neutraceutical sea buckthorn oil (SBKT) derived from the fruit pulp of . Chemical analysis of the SBKT showed the presence of 16 major saturated, mono-, and polyunsaturated fatty  components, imparting significant nutritional values. Efficacy of the SBKT in modulating  and associated inflammation was first tested  using human monocytic (THP-1) cells. SBKT induced cytotoxicity at a dose of ≥25 µl/ml. Treatment of the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated THP-1 cells with SBKT subdued the enhanced release of intracellular reactive nitrogen species and expression of NF-κB protein, in a concentration-dependent manner. This was accompanied by a reduction in the release of downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines: Interleukin-1ß and interleukin-6. Tumor necrosis factor-α released in the stimulated THP-1 cells were also inhibited by SBKT dose of 5 µl/ml.  oral and topical treatment with SBKT in the Carrageenan-stimulated paw edema model, showed a significant decrease in paw volume and edema. In the 12-O tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) stimulated CD-1 mice -like model, concurrent oral and tropical SBKT treatments substantially reduced ear edema and ear biopsy weights. Histopathologically, significant reduction in ear epidermal thickness and skin lesion scores was observed in the SBKT-treated animals. In conclusion, SBKT showed anti-inflammatory and anti--like efficacies in healing chemical-induced inflammation and . The possible mode of action of SBKT was found through inhibition of reactive nitrogen species, and downregulation of NF-κB protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines.

The exact mechanism of DMF is yet to be fully understood even though its beneficial effects on the immune system are extensively studied. It has been shown that DMF/MMF can affect various immune cells, which can get involved in both the naive and adaptive immune systems, such as T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells. It is suggested that DMF/MMF may exert their effect on immune cells through inhibition of nuclear factor-κB translocation, upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2(E2)-related factor antioxidant pathway, and activation of hydroxyl carboxylic  receptor 2. In this review, the mechanisms underlying the modulatory functions of DMF or MMF on the main immune cell populations involved in the immunopathogenesis of MS are discussed.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30023945>Discovery of Retinoic -Related Orphan Receptor γt Inverse Agonists via Docking and Negative Image-Based Screening.</a></h1><p>Retinoic -related orphan receptor γt (RORγt) has a vital role in the differentiation of T-helper 17 (TH17) cells. Potent and specific RORγt inverse agonists are sought for treating TH17-related diseases such as , rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes. Here, the aim was to discover novel RORγt ligands using both standard molecular docking and negative image-based screening. Interestingly, both of these in silico techniques put forward mostly the same compounds for experimental testing. In total, 11 of the 34 molecules purchased for testing were verified as RORγt inverse agonists, thus making the effective hit rate 32%. The pIC values for the compounds varied from 4.9 (11 μM) to 6.2 (590 nM). Importantly, the fact that the verified hits represent four different cores highlights the structural diversity of the RORγt inverse agonism and the ability of the applied screening methodologies to facilitate much-desired scaffold hopping for drug design.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30034395>The Interplay Between Keratinocytes and Immune Cells in the Pathogenesis of .</a></h1><p> is a chronic inflammatory skin disease resulting from genetic, epigenetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. To date, several immunopathogenic mechanisms of  have been elucidated, and, in the current model, the cross talk between autoreactive T cells and resident keratinocytes generates inflammatory and immune circuits responsible for the initiation, progression, and persistence of the disease. Several autoantigens derived from keratinocytes (i.e., LL37 cathelecidin/nucleic  complexes, newly generated lipid antigens) have been identified, which may trigger initial activation of T cells, particularly IL-17-producing T cells, T helper (Th)1 and Th22 cells. Hence, lymphokines released in skin lesions are pivotal for keratinocyte activation and production of inflammatory molecules, which in turn lead to amplification of the local immune responses. Intrinsic genetic alterations of keratinocytes in the activation of signal transduction pathways dependent on T-cell-derived cytokines are also fundamental. The current review emphasizes the aberrant interplay of immune cells and skin-resident keratinocytes in establishing and sustaining inflammatory and immune responses in .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30483125>Cutaneous Leukemic Infiltrates Successfully Treated With Biomodulatory Therapy in a Rare Case of Therapy-Related High Risk MDS/AML.</a></h1><p>Cutaneous manifestations in hematologic malignancies, especially in leukemia, are not common and may be very variable. Here we report a very unusual case of a patient (female, 70 years old) who was admitted to the hospital in 2016 because of skin lesions on the face, the trunk of the body and the extremities. She had a history of breast cancer in the year 2004 (pT1b, pN0, cM0, L0, V0, R0) which had been resected and treated with adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracile) as well as  treated with methotrexate and cyclosporine. Because of mild cytopenia a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy was performed showing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with multilineage dysplasia. Cytogenetic review revealed a complex aberrant karyotype denoting adverse outcome. Simultaneously, a skin biopsy could confirm leukemic skin infiltration. Consequently, a therapy with azacitidine was started. After the first cycle the patient developed severe pancytopenia with a percentage of 13% peripheral blasts (previously 0-2%) as well as fever without evidence for infection which was interpreted as progressive disease. Therefore, the therapeutic regimen was changed to a biomodulatory therapy consisting of low-dose azacitidine 75 mg/day (given sc d1-7 of 28), pioglitazone 45 mg/day per os, and all-trans-retinoic  (ATRA) 45 mg/m2/day per os. After cycle 1 of this combined biomodulatory therapy the patient showed hematologic recovery; besides a mild anemia (hemoglobin 11.1 g/dl) she developed a normal blood count. Moreover, the cutaneous leukemic infiltrates which had been unaffected by the azacitidine ameliorated tremendously after 2 cycles resulting in a complete remission of the skin lesions after cycle 6. In conclusion, we report a very unusual case with cutaneous infiltrates being the first clinical manifestation of hematologic disease, preceding the development of acute myeloid leukemia. While azacitidine alone was ineffective, a combined biomodulatory approach resulted in a complete remission of the cutaneous manifestation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31398661>Inhibitory effect of α-amyrin acetate isolated from Fraxinus rhynchophylla on Th17 polarization.</a></h1><p>T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which are differentiated from CD4 T cells, drive inflammation, leading to autoimmune diseases such as , rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, inhibiting Th17 polarization could be a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases.We investigated the inhibitory effect of Fraxinus rhynchophylla (Oleaceae) on Th17 differentiation and found its active component.The activity of F. rhynchophylla and its active constituent was verified using CD4 cells extracted from C57BL/6 mice.Micro-environment for Th17 polarization was provided to CD4 cells and the effect of treatment with samples was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and Western blot.The extract of F. rhynchophylla Hance and its chemical constituent, α-amyrin acetate, which was isolated via bioassay-guided isolation, significantly inhibited Th17 polarization as revealed when interleukin (IL)-17, a characteristic cytokine produced by Th17 cells, was measured. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of α-amyrin acetate was compared to the amyrin derivatives, α-amyrin and β-amyrin. All displayed a suppressive effect on Th17 polarization and all reduced the expression of single transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and retinoic  receptor-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt), which are crucial transcription factors regulating Th17 differentiation. α-Amyrin acetate, however, exhibited the most prominent effects, which indicates that the functional group, acetate, might strengthen the inhibitory effect on Th17 differentiation.Taken together, these results suggest that the extract of F. rhynchophylla and its active constituent, α-amyrin acetate, could be applied as a potential therapeutic agent for autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.Copyright © 2019.

Efficacy assessments using the validated IGAxBSA composite tool.HP/TAZ lotion demonstrated statistically significant superiority at week 8 (versus TAZ and vehicle) and week 12 (versus HP, TAZ, and vehicle). By week 8, HP/TAZ lotion achieved a 63.5% reduction in mean IGAxBSA composite score (P<0.001 versus TAZ and vehicle), that was sustained four weeks posttreatment (P<0.001 versus TAZ and vehicle and P=0.003 versus HP). A 25% and 50% improvement in IGAxBSA was achieved within 1.9 and 4.6 weeks, respectively, and 47.5% of patients achieved IGAxBSA-75 by week 8.This post hoc analysis was limited to patients with moderate-to-severe plaque  with IGA ≥3 and BSA involvement (3%-12%).HP/TAZ lotion was associated with significant and rapid reductions in disease severity as assessed by the IGAxBSA composite tool.

The results showed disturbances in lipid metabolism of psoriatic patients reflected by different phospholipid profiles. The levels of non-enzymatic lipid metabolites associated with oxidative stress 8-isoprostaglandin F2α (8-isoPGF2α) and free 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) were higher in PsA, although levels of 4-HNE-His adducts were higher in Ps. In the case of the enzymatic metabolism of lipids, enhanced levels of endocannabinoids were observed in both forms of , while higher expression of their receptors and activities of phospholipases were detected only in Ps. Moreover, cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) activity was enhanced only in Ps, but cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was enhanced both in Ps and PsA, generating higher levels of eicosanoids: prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic  (13HODE), thromboxane B2 (TXB2). Surprisingly, some of major eicosanoids 15-d-PGJ (15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J), 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HETE) were elevated in Ps and reduced in PsA.

Eicosanoid pathways are implicated in synovitis and joint destruction in inflammatory arthritis, yet they might also have a protective function, underscoring the need for a comprehensive understanding of how eicosanoid pathways might be imbalanced. Until recently, sensitive and scalable methods for detecting and quantifying a high number of eicosanoids have not been available.Here, we intend to describe a detailed eicosanoid profiling in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and evaluate correlations with parameters of disease activity.Forty-one patients with PsA, all of whom satisfied the CASPAR classification criteria for PsA, were studied. Outcomes reflecting the activity of peripheral arthritis as well as skin , Disease Activity Score (DAS)28, Clinical Disease Index (CDAI) and Body Surface Area (BSA) were assessed. Serum eicosanoids were determined by LC-MS, and the correlation between metabolite levels and disease scores was evaluated.Sixty-six eicosanoids were identified by reverse-phase LC/MS. Certain eicosanoids species including several pro-inflammatory eicosanoids such as PGE2, HXB3 or 6,15-dk,dh,PGF1a correlated with joint disease score. Several eicosapentaenoic  (EPA)-derived eicosanoids, which associate with anti-inflammatory properties, such as 11-HEPE, 12-HEPE and 15-HEPE, correlated with DAS28 (Disease Activity Score) and CDAI (Clinical Disease Activity Index) as well. Of interest, resolvin D1, a DHA-derived anti-inflammatory eicosanoid, was down-regulated in patients with high disease activity.Both pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids were associated with joint disease score, potentially representing pathways of harm as well as benefit. Further studies are needed to determine whether these eicosanoid species might also play a role in the pathogenesis of joint inflammation in PsA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30471763>CD147 Is a Novel Chemotherapy or Prevention Target in Melanoma.</a></h1><p>CD147, also named as BSG, was first identified from F9 embryonal carcinoma cells (Miyauchi et al., 1990) and the human BSG locus on chromosome 19p13.3 containing 10 exons (Belton et al., 2008; Kaname et al., 1993; Liao et al., 2011), which encodes four alternatively spliced transcripts:CD147/Bsg-1,2,3,4 (Kaname et al., 1993; Liao et al., 2011). Bsg-1 has three Ig-like domains (CD147/Bsg-1) (Hanna et al., 2003; Ochrietor et al., 2003), while CD147/Bsg-3,4 contains a single Ig-like domain (Belton et al., 2008; Liao et al., 2011). Evidence shows that CD147/Bsg-2 is the most abundant and best characterized splice product, which contains two Ig-like domains (Weidle et al., 2010). Analysis of amino  showed that CD147 contains a single-chain type I transmembrane domain composed of a 21-amino  signal sequence, an extracellular domain consisting of 186 amino  with two Ig-like domains and a cytoplasmic domain of 41 residues (Kanekura et al., 2010; Yurchenko et al., 2005). There are three glycosylation sites at three conserved asparagine (Asn 44, 152, and 186) in the CD147 N-terminal domain (Fadool et al., 1993; Tang et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2006), which could explain the molecular mass of CD147 shifts from a predicted molecular weight of about 27 kDa to 40-65 kDa with Western blotting. Inhibition of glycosylation by specific inhibitors showed that on carbohydrate side groups bearing β-1,6-branched, polylactosamine-type sugars, fucosylations are the major glycosylation type in N-glycosylation of CD147 (Ni et al., 2014; Riethdorf et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2004). In addition, N-glycosylation of CD147 has been identified as low glycosylated (approximately 32 kDa) or high glycosylated (approximately 45-65 kDa). The fully glycosylated mature CD147 (high-glycosylated CD147) is translocated to the plasma membrane, while low-glycosylated CD147 is the precursor of high-glycosylated CD147 in the endoplasmic reticulum, which requires additional modification in the Golgi prior to being expressed on the cell surface; high levels of glycosylation are a primary biochemical property of CD147 (Jia et al., 2006; Jiang et al., 2014; Ni et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2004).Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

It is quoted in almost all known medical treatises, from Antiquity up to modern era, such as Corpus Hippocraticum, Dioscorides' De Materia Medica and later on in medieval medical manuscripts and Pharmacopoeias. Actually, it is widely used as herbal medicine for the relief of mild symptoms of mental stress, to aid sleep and for symptomatic treatment of mild gastrointestinal complaints including bloating and flatulence. In Greece, the empirical physicians "vikoyiatroi" recommended the decoction of dry flowers and leaves to treat tracheobronchitis, hysteria, epilepsy, heart arrhythmias, as hypnotic and against skin disorders.The present study was conducted to investigate the potential beneficial effects in  in mice of M. officinalis ssp. altissima and to carry out the chemical analysis in order to reveal its main bioactive secondary metabolites.Non polar and polar extracts of M. officinalis ssp. altissima aerial parts were prepared by using dichloromethane and methanol, successively; in addition a decoction was made upon oral information by local users in Crete, where the plant was collected. All three preparations were chemically analyzed in order to isolate their main constituents. Chemical structures of all isolated compounds were determined by 1D, 2D-NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Furthermore, the antioxidant potential of extracts and decoction was evaluated through DPPH radical scavenging capability. The in vivo in mice anti-psoriatic efficacy of all preparations was estimated through clinical and histopathological assessment and measurements of TEWL and hydration.The dichloromethane extract yielded ursolic , 2α-hydroxy-ursolic , pomolic , 3β-stearyloxy-urs-12-ene, oleanolic , noropacursane and campesterol; the methanol extract afforded rosmarinic  and methyl rosmarinate, while from the decoction caffeic , 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)lactic  and rosmarinic  were isolated. The  evaluation, based on PASI score, photodocumentation and histopathological estimation showed that the decoction primarily and the dichloromethane extract secondly could significantly contribute to  treatment. The decoction seems able to reestablish skin physiology by decreasing dryness and enhancing skin barrier function. Moreover, the decoction showed the best antioxidant activity, while the dichloromethane extract the weakest.The triterpene derivatives of the dichloromethane extract are likely to be responsible for its anti-psoriatic activity. The abundant polyphenolic load of the decoction contributes to its high antioxidant activity and the most effective results against . The anti-psoriatic activity of the decoction confirmed the traditional use of this plant as antioxidant, wound healing and skin barrier repair agent.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Patients with PsA have an increased incidence of subclinical atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction. The aim of this study is to perform a review of the biomarkers of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with PsA.  A search was performed in the electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase) up until July 2017. Studies were considered if they included data on biomarkers of subclinical atherosclerosis in PsA, and each article was then reviewed for quality and clinical relevance. After completing the literature search, all screened literature was summarized and discussed in our study group (CaRRDs study group).

The novel derivatives were evaluated for their antioxidant activity using DPPH, hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion and ABTS, anti-lipid peroxidation and soybean lipoxygenase inhibition assays. The compounds presented medium interaction with DPPH (30⁻48% at 100 µM). In contrast all the synthesized derivatives strongly scavenge OH radicals (72⁻100% at 100 µM), ABTS (24⁻83% at 100 µM) and presented remarkable inhibition (87⁻100% at 100 µM) in linoleic  peroxidation (AAPH). The topological polar surface of the compounds seems to govern the superoxide anion scavenging activity.

Although the protective effects of MgIG on methotrexate (MTX)-induced liver toxicity have been well-documented, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. MTX was initially used to treat pediatric acute leukemia, and has been widely applied to  therapy. However, its clinical applications are limited due to hepatotoxicity and intestinal toxicity. Herein, prophylactic administration of MgIG (9 and 18 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced the levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in the serum of rats receiving intravenous injection of MTX (20 mg/kg body weight). MgIG also attenuated MTX-induced hepatic fibrosis. Moreover, it better protected against MTX-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and decreased the serum level of malondialdehyde than reduced glutathione (80 mg/kg/day) did. Interestingly, MTX-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, intestinal permeability and inflammation were attenuated after MgIG administration. In addition, MgIG (9 and 18 mg/kg) reduced MTX-induced colocalization of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and connexin 43 (Cx43) in intestinal villi.

There is currently no cure for , but various treatments can help to relieve the symptoms and signs. The objectives of treatment when managing an acute flare of guttate  are to reduce time to clearance and induction of long-term remission after resolution. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2000; since then, new treatments have expanded the therapeutic spectrum of systemic treatments used for .To assess the effects of non-antistreptococcal interventions for acute guttate  or an acute guttate flare of chronic .We searched the following databases up to June 2018: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. We checked the proceedings of key dermatology conferences from 2004 to 2018, and also searched for trials in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) database for drug registration.All randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of treatments for acute guttate  or an acute guttate flare of chronic  clinically diagnosed in children and adults. This included all topical and systemic drugs, biological therapy, phototherapy (all forms: topical and systemic), and complementary and alternative therapies. We compared these treatments against placebo or against another treatment. We did not include studies on drugs that aim to eradicate streptococcal infection. We did not include studies when separate results for guttate  participants were not available.Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and methodological quality and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were 'percentage of participants clear or almost clear (i.e. obtaining  Area Severity Index (PASI) 100/90 and/or Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of 0 or 1)' and 'percentage of participants with adverse effects and severe adverse effects'. Our secondary outcomes were 'number of relapses of guttate  or flares within a period of six months after the treatment has finished', 'percentage of participants achieving a PASI 75 or PGA of 1 or 2', and 'improvement in participant satisfaction measures and quality of life assessment measures'. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome.This review included only one trial (21 participants), which compared fish oil-derived (n-3) fatty -based lipid emulsion (50 mL per infusion (1.05 g eicosapentaenoic and 10.5 g docosahexaenoic )) (10 participants) to soya oil-derived (n-6) fatty -based lipid emulsion (50 mL per infusion (1.05 g eicosapentaenoic and 10.5 g docosahexaenoic )) (11 participants) administered intravenously twice daily for 10 days, with a total follow-up of 40 days. The study was conducted in a single centre in Germany in 18 men and three women, aged between 21 and 65 years, who were in hospital with acute guttate  and had mean total body surface involvement of 25.7% ± 20.4% (range 10 to 90). The study was funded by a company that produces the oil emulsions. We found no other evidence regarding non-antistreptococcal interventions used in clinical practice for guttate , such as topical treatments (corticosteroids, vitamin D₃ analogues), systemic drugs, biological therapy, and phototherapy.The primary outcomes of the review were not measured, and only one of our secondary outcomes was measured: improvement in participant satisfaction measures and quality of life assessment measures. However, the study authors did report that there was rare skin irritation at the site of peripheral intravenous route, but the number of affected participants was not provided.Improvement between baseline and day 10, using a non-validated score assessed by participants themselves daily based on five items (appearance of lesions, impairment of daily life, pruritus, burning, and pain), was greater in the group that received the fish oil-derived (n-3) fatty -based lipid emulsion (75%) than in the group receiving the soya oil-derived (n-6) fatty -based lipid emulsion (18%) (one trial, 21 participants). However, these results are uncertain as they are based on very low-quality evidence.There is no evidence regarding topical and systemic drugs, biotherapy, or phototherapy in guttate  (we did not consider drugs that aimed to eradicate streptococcal infection because these are assessed in another Cochrane Review). We are uncertain of the effect of intravenously administered lipid emulsion on guttate  because the quality of the evidence is very low, due to risk of bias (unclear risk of bias for all domains), indirectness (the trial only included adults, and the follow-up from baseline was only 10 days), and imprecision (small number of participants).This review highlights the need for trials assessing the efficacy and safety of phototherapy and topical and systemic drugs for guttate . There is also a need for studies that clearly distinguish the specific population with guttate  from the larger group of people with chronic plaque , and children and young adults should be assessed as a distinct group.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643883>Retinoids.</a></h1><p>Retinoids are both natural and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A, several of which have been developed for medical uses, largely to replace vitamin A which in high, therapeutic doses is associated with considerable toxicity. Retinoids have multiple actions and play important roles in regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, vision, bone growth, tumor suppression and immunity. The effects of retinoids are thought to be mediated by their binding to and activation of the retinoic  and retinoid X receptors which regulate gene expression, important in normal growth and differentiation. Vitamin A in doses that have medical effects was found to be toxic, particularly when given long term. Modification of the vitamin A structure led to retinoid molecules that had many of its beneficial, but fewer of its adverse effects. Oral retinoids in use in the United States include acitretin for  and isotretinoin for severe nodular acne. Tretinoin is used topically and several other retinoids have been developed for therapy of uncommon forms of cancer (alitretinoin, bexarotene). The commonly used retinoids have many of the side effects of vitamin A including dry skin, cheilosis and nosebleeds and hair loss, but are not stored in the liver and do not cause the typical form of chronic liver disease associated with excessive vitamin A intake. Both acitretin and isotretinoin are teratogenic and embryotoxic and are contraindicated in women who are or intend to become pregnant. Retinoids have been implicated in causing mild-to-moderate elevations in routine liver tests, but these elevations are usually asymptomatic and transient, resolving spontaneously even with continued therapy. Marked elevations in serum aminotransferase levels during retinoid therapy are uncommon, and dose adjustment or drug discontinuation are rarely required for liver test abnormalities. Nevertheless, laboratory monitoring is recommended with routine liver tests at baseline and one month later, and testing thereafter only if abnormalities were found or symptoms arise. Several retinoids (acitretin, etretinate, retinal acetate) have been associated with a clinically apparent acute liver injury which typically arises during the first 3 months of therapy, has many features of hypersensitivity and can be severe and even fatal. Interestingly, isotretinoin often causes mild serum aminotransferase elevations and is commonly listed as having frequent adverse effects on the liver, but it has not been convincingly linked to instances of severe clinically apparent, acute liver injury with jaundice. Two retinoids used in dermatology, acitretin and isotretinoin, are discussed in this record and their combined references of retinoids are provided at the end of this introductory section. The hepatotoxicity of vitamin A is discussed separately in another record.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30621136>Development of A New Delivery System Based on Drug-Loadable Electrospun Nanofibers for  Treatment.</a></h1><p> is a chronic autoimmune systemic disease with an approximate incidence of 2% worldwide; it is commonly characterized by squamous lesions on the skin that present the typical pain, stinging, and bleeding associated with an inflammatory response. In this work, poly(methyl vinyl ether--maleic ethyl monoester) (PMVEMA-ES) nanofibers have been designed as a delivery vehicle for three therapeutic agents with palliative properties for the symptoms of this disease (salicylic , methyl salicylate, and capsaicin). For such a task, the production of these nanofibers by means of the electrospinning technique has been optimized. Their morphology and size have been characterized by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). By selecting the optimal conditions to achieve the smallest and most uniform nanofibers, approximate diameters of up to 800⁻900 nm were obtained. It was also determined that the therapeutic agents that were used were encapsulated with high efficiency. The analysis of their stability over time by GC-MS showed no significant losses of the encapsulated compounds 15 days after their preparation, except in the case of methyl salicylate. Likewise, it was demonstrated that the therapeutic compounds that were encapsulated conserved, and even improved, their capacity to activate the transient receptor potential cation channel 1 (TRPV1) channel, which has been associated with the formation of psoriatic lesions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30133998>Secukinumab reduces plasma oxidative stress in : A case-based experience.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31261036>Carbenoxolone ameliorates hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation in obese mice induced by high fat diet via regulating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>Carbenoxolone (CBX) is the active principle of licorice, which is used to treat , peptic ulcers, and wound healing. However, there is no report on how CBX ameliorates hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation in obese mice. In this study, our aim is to explore the mechanism by which CBX regulates lipid metabolism in the liver of obese mice. C57BL/6J mice were divided into three groups and were fed with normal chow diet (NC group) or High-fat diet (HFD and CBX group) for eight weeks. Then mice in CBX group were given CBX every day by gavage for twelve weeks (15 mg/kg). Blood was collected for detection of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Liver tissues were stained with hematoxylin-eosin for histological examination. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for detection of SOCS-3 (Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3), SREBP-1 (Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1), and FAS (Fatty  synthase) protein. The genes of SOCS-3, SREBP-1, and FAS in liver were assessed by real-time PCR. Western blotting was applied to detect the protein expressions of the phosphorylated JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) and phosphorylated STAT3 (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3). Our results showed that compared with the HFD group, serum concentrations of TG, TC and LDL were decreased significantly, while the concentration of HDL was increased in the CBX group. CBX could attenuate intracellular lipid accumulation in the liver. Besides, treatment with CBX could significantly decrease levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-6 (Interleukin 6) and TNF-a (Tumor necrosis factor-a), increase expressions of phosphorylated JAK2 and phosphorylated STAT3, decrease the expressions of SOCS-3, SREBP-1 and FAS in the liver. In conclusion, through activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in liver and reducing the expression of SCOCS-3, CBX could further decrease the expressions of SREBP-1c, FAS and ameliorate the inflammatory state of liver, so as to protecting the liver from lipid metabolism damage induced by high-fat diet. Therefore, CBX has the possibility for the treatment of obesity, hyperlipidemia, and inflammation.Copyright © 2019.

A prospective real-life multicentre study in France.</a></h1><p>Methotrexate (MTX) is a major systemic treatment for moderate to severe plaque . A randomized trial has recently been published evaluating a single weekly dosage (17.5mg), but few prospective real-life data are available. The main objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of MTX in real-life. The secondary objectives were to evaluate predictive parameters for treatment efficacy and the frequency of adverse events.A prospective cohort involving consecutive at in 25 centres belonging to GEM RESOPSO included all adults with plaque  in whom MTX treatment was initiated. The efficacy criterion was achievement of PASI 75 at week (W) 12/16. The impact of demographic data,  characteristics (duration, topography, rheumatism), dosage (W12/16 dosage, cumulative dose after 4 weeks), and mode of administration (subcutaneous vs. oral, concomitant use of folic ) on efficacy was evaluated. Intention-to-treat (ITT),per protocol (PP), and multivariate analyses were performed.Two hundred and fifty-six patients (F/M: 105/151; mean age: 45.0 years; rheumatism: 12.6%) with plaque  were included. 99 patients were not analysed at W12/16 (16 because of inefficacy, 16 because of intolerance, 56 were lost to follow-up or had data missing). PASI 75 was achieved in 98 patients, with efficacy of 38.3% in the ITT analysis and 58.3% in the PP analysis. In the ITT analysis, absence of previous use of cyclosporine (P=0.01) and a cumulative dose of MTX>60mg after 4 weeks (P<0.0001) were associated with higher PASI 75 rates. In the PP analysis, only absence of previous use of cyclosporine (P=0.0009) was associated with a better PASI 75 results. There was no association between PASI 75 and patient characteristics (including body mass index), clinical aspects of , route of administration, combination with folic , or W12/16 dose. Adverse events were reported by 34.8% of patients. These consisted mainly of digestive disorders (nausea, abdominal pain), asthenia and moderate hepatic cytolysis. The frequency of adverse events was correlated with methotrexate dosage.The efficacy of MTX in plaque  in this real-life study of 256 patients is consistent with the data in the literature, including the recently published randomized trial (41% PASI 75). This rate was unaffected by patient weight, route of administration and combined use of folic . Absence of previous use of cyclosporine appears to be associated with better efficacy although there is no clear explanation for this. The initial dosage (high dose in the first month) appears to be associated with superior efficacy for W12/W16.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Keratinocytes show a potential role for the origin of . In this study, we estimated the efficiency of 2 anthranilate derivatives-(E)-4-( N-{2-[1-(hydroxyimino)ethyl]phenyl}sulfamoyl)phenyl pivalate (HFP031) and butyl 2-[2-(2-fluorophenyl)acetamido]benzoate (HFP034)-on  amelioration in a mouse model. The results showed that topical treatment with both compounds could attenuate epidermal thickness and scaling in an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced  mouse model via decreased expression of cytokines and chemokines [C-X-C chemokine ligand (CXCL)1 and CXCL2], leading to the reduction of neutrophilic abscess in the skin. The in vivo cutaneous absorption of HFP034 was 7.6-fold greater than that of HFP031. Both compounds caused negligible irritation on healthy mouse skin. In addition, we examined the effect of the anthranilate derivatives on chemokine expression in IMQ-treated HaCaT keratinocytes. Our results elucidated a mechanism for anti-inflammatory activity of HFP034 that involved the elevation of intracellular cAMP concentration, suppression of NF-κB activity, and attenuation of neutrophil chemoattractant expression. These results suggest that HFP034 could increase the cutaneous concentration of cAMP to suppress neutrophil infiltration into the skin.

The objective was to show the course of metabolic and liver parameters under secukinumab, etanercept, or placebo treatment over time. A further objective was to assess the impact of selected comorbidities and metabolic characteristics on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), as a surrogate marker of systemic inflammation.Data from the phase 3 randomised controlled trials (FIXTURE [], ERASURE [], and SCULPTURE []; n=3010) were included in this analysis. Patients were treated with secukinumab 150 mg or 300 mg, placebo or etanercept 50 mg (FIXTURE only) as active comparator. A set of metabolic and liver parameters was longitudinally assessed over 52 weeks. Multivariate regression analyses assessed the impact of selected comorbidities and metabolic characteristics on hs-CRP levels at baseline and under treatment.Secukinumab treatment reduced hs-CRP levels. Body weight and uric  levels tended to decrease over 52 weeks with secukinumab. Secukinumab showed a neutral effect on fasting plasma glucose, lipid parameters and liver enzymes. Psoriatic arthritis, metabolic syndrome, obesity, impaired glucose metabolism, and hyperuricemia were each associated with increased hs-CRP levels at baseline. Concomitant obesity attenuated the decline in hs-CRP under treatment.These analyses suggest neutral to favourable long term trends in metabolic and liver parameters under secukinumab treatment. Metabolic comorbidities were associated with increased hs-CRP levels, reflecting the role of systemic inflammatory processes in their pathophysiology.© 2019 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30503675>Ascorbic  derivative DDH-1 ameliorates -like skin lesions in mice by suppressing inflammatory cytokine expression.</a></h1><p> is a chronic inflammatory skin disease in which inflammatory cytokines play a major role in its pathogenesis.

Exosomes, a type of extracellular vesicles, are released by every cell type and are present in most body fluids, what makes them attractive targets of biomarker research. Several studies have indicated that their content - including proteins and coding, as well as non-coding nucleic  - could represent the disease state and serves as specific disease biomarkers. Out of these molecules, a special interest was gained by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Just as exosomes, lncRNAs are specific to their cell of origin and often specific to diseases, also found extracellularly, mainly contained in extracellular vesicles. Thus, recent efforts in biomarker research has turned to circulating exosomal lncRNAs, which might lead to the development of highly specific disease markers. Here we summarize the current knowledge on disease-associated exosomal long non-coding RNAs. The intensive studies in this area have revealed numerous potential targets for biomarkers, and highlighted the potential of their combination with other exosomal markers to represent a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tool. However, we believe that additional functional data on both exosomes and lncRNAs are necessary for understanding their deregulation in diseases and developing their use as diagnostic approaches.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31396693>Effectiveness of methotrexate in moderate to severe  patients: real-world registry data from the Swiss Dermatology Network for Targeted Therapies (SDNTT).</a></h1><p>Methotrexate (MTX) is a frequently used anti-psoriatic drug that is commonly recommended in international  guidelines. It is effective in treating skin lesions, nail changes and psoriatic arthritis. In 2017 a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, commonly known as the METOP trial, was published assessing the effectiveness and safety of subcutaneous administration of methotrexate. Because trial data do not always relate to real-life data with unselected patient populations, we wanted to determine whether the data obtained in the METOP-trial correspond to real-life registry data from our Swiss Dermatology Network for Targeted Therapies (SDNTT). Data of 449 patients with moderate to severe  who participated in the SDNTT registry between 2011 and 1st of July 2017 were analyzed. Only patients receiving methotrexate s.c. were included. 66 patients under MTX were included into this study. Baseline PASI was 6.3 ± 3.8 (SDNTT) compared to 15.9 ± 5.9 in the METOP trial. In our cohort, only 18% of all patients reached PASI 75 after 12 weeks, 6% showed a complete remission (PASI 100) compared to 41% and 4% in the METOP trial after 16 weeks. 22.7% of all patients showed increased liver enzymes in either study and nausea was seen in 15% (SDNTT) versus 22% (METOP) of patients.

The aim of this study was to develop an anti-TNFα antibody, which may be used as a therapeutic option to inhibit TNFα-mediated cytotoxicity. We characterized several hybridoma clones secreting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to human-TNFα. Four mAbs rescued L929 fibroblast cells from TNFα-triggered cell death and one of these, namely C8, was found to have the highest affinity. To gain insights into the mechanism by which mAb C8 inhibits human TNFα-mediated toxicity, the epitope corresponding to the mAb was delineated. The antigenic determinant was found to comprise of the stretch of amino  99-120, of which, 102-104 (glutamine, arginine, glutamic ) form the core epitope. The observation was supported by bioinformatics analyses of an antigen/antibody complex model. In addition, the binding affinity of mAb C8 to TNFα was found to be comparable with that of infliximab, which is a commercially available anti-TNFα mAb.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30835819>Antistreptococcal interventions for guttate and chronic plaque .</a></h1><p> is a chronic skin disease that affects approximately two per cent of the general population. Plaque  is the most common form: it usually appears as raised, red patches of inflamed skin, covered with silvery white scales. The patches often occur in a symmetrical pattern. Guttate  is a particular form of  with widespread, small erythematosquamous lesions. Streptococcal infection is suspected to be a triggering factor for the onset of guttate , and flare-up of chronic plaque . The previous Cochrane Review on this topic was published in 2000; it required an update because antistreptococcal treatment continues to be used to treat , especially for the acute form of guttate .To assess the effects of antistreptococcal interventions for guttate and chronic plaque .We searched Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, Cochrane Register of Studies Online, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and five trials registers (January 2019). We checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies and searched conference proceedings from the American Academy of Dermatology, Society for Investigative Dermatology, and European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing antistreptococcal interventions (tonsillectomy or systemic antibiotic treatment) in people with clinically diagnosed acute guttate and chronic plaque  compared with placebo, no intervention, or each other.We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcome measures were: 1) time-to-resolution; achieving clear or almost clear skin (Physician Global Assessment (PGA) 0 or 1 or  Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 or 100); 2) proportion of participants with adverse effects and severe adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were: 1) proportion of participants achieving clear or almost clear skin; 2) proportion of participants achieving PASI 75 or PGA 1 to 2; 3) risk of having at least one relapse at long-term follow-up. Short-term assessment was defined as within eight weeks of the start of treatment; long-term was at least one year after the start of treatment.We included five trials (162 randomised participants); three were conducted in a hospital dermatology department. One study declared funding by a pharmaceutical company. Participants' ages ranged from 12 to 77 years; only two participants were younger than 15 years. Mean PASI score at baseline varied from 5.7 (i.e. mild) to 23 (i.e. severe) in four studies. Twenty-three of 162 participants had streptococcus-positive throat swab culture. We did not perform a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity of participants' characteristics and interventions.None of the trials measured our efficacy primary outcome, time-to-resolution, or the secondary outcome, risk of having at least one relapse at long-term follow-up.We rated the quality of the results as very low-quality evidence, due to high risk of bias (absence of blinding of participants and caregivers, and high risk of outcome reporting bias) and imprecision (single study data with a low number of events). Hence, we are very uncertain about the results presented.Guttate psoriasisOne three-armed trial (N = 43) assessed penicillin (50,000 international units (IU)/kg/day in three doses) versus erythromycin (250 mg four times per day) versus no treatment (treatment for 14 days, with six-week follow-up from start of treatment). Adverse events and the proportion of participants achieving clear or almost clear skin were not measured.One trial (N = 20) assessed penicillin (1.6 MU (million units) intramuscularly once a day) versus no treatment (six weeks of treatment, with eight-week follow-up from start of treatment). At six-week (short-term) follow-up, no adverse events were observed in either group, and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of participants with clear or almost clear skin (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 5.85).One trial (N = 20) assessed rifampicin (300 mg twice daily) versus placebo (14-day treatment duration; six-week follow-up from start of treatment); none of the review outcomes were measured.These trials did not measure the proportion of participants achieving PASI 75 or PGA 1 to 2.Chronic plaque psoriasisOne trial (N = 50) assessed long-term azithromycin treatment (500 mg daily dose) versus vitamin C. Adverse events were reported in the azithromycin group (10 out of 30 had nausea and mild abdominal upset), but not in the vitamin C group. The proportion of participants who achieved clear or almost clear skin was not measured. In the azithromycin group, 18/30 versus 0/20 participants in the vitamin C group reached PASI 75 at the end of 48 weeks of treatment (RR 25.06, 95% CI 1.60 to 393.59).One trial (N = 29) assessed tonsillectomy versus no treatment, with 24-month follow-up after surgery. One participant in the tonsillectomy group had minor bleeding. At eight-week follow-up, 1/15 in the tonsillectomy group, and 0/14 in the no treatment group achieved PASI 90; and 3/15 participants in the tonsillectomy group, and 0/14 in the no treatment group achieved PASI 75 (RR 6.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 116.7).We found only five trials (N = 162), which assessed the effects of five comparisons (systemic antibiotic treatment (penicillin, azithromycin) or tonsillectomy). Two comparisons (erythromycin compared to no treatment, and rifampicin compared to placebo) did not measure any of the outcomes of interest. There was very low-quality evidence for the outcomes that were measured, Therefore, we are uncertain of both the efficacy and safety of antistreptococcal interventions for guttate and chronic plaque .The included trials were at unclear or high risk of bias and involved only a small number of unrepresentative participants, with limited measurement of our outcomes of interest. The studies did not allow investigation into the influence of Streptococcal infection, and a key intervention (amoxicillin) was not assessed.Further trials assessing the efficacy and tolerance of penicillin V or amoxicillin are needed in children and young adults with guttate .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605740>Targeting LAT1-mediated amino  transport in innate and adaptive T cells efficiently controls skin inflammation.</a></h1><p> is a frequent inflammatory skin disease, mainly mediated by IL-23, IL-1β, and IL-17 cytokines. Although  is a hyper-proliferative skin disorder, the possible role of amino  transporters has remained unexplored.To investigate the role of the essential amino  transporter LAT1 (SLC7A5) in .LAT1 floxed mice were crossed to Cre-expressing mouse strains under the control of Keratin 5, CD4 and RORγt. We produced models of skin inflammation induced by Imiquimod and IL-23, and tested the effect of inhibiting LAT1 (JPH203) and mTOR (Rapamycin).LAT1 expression is increased in keratinocytes and skin-infiltrating lymphocytes of psoriatic lesions in humans and mice. LAT1 deletion in keratinocytes does not dampen the inflammatory response or their proliferation, which could be maintained by increased expression of alternative amino  transporter LAT2 and LAT3. Specific deletion of LAT1 in γδ and CD4 T cells controls the inflammatory response induced by Imiquimod. LAT1 deletion or inhibition blocks the expansion of IL-17-secreting γ4δ4 T cells and CD4 T cells and dampens the release of IL-1β, IL-17, and IL-22 in the Imiquimod-induced model. Moreover, inhibition of LAT1 blocks the expansion of human γδ T cells and IL-17 secretion by human CD4 T cells. IL-23 and IL-1β stimulation upregulates LAT1 expression and induce mTOR activation in IL-17 γδ and Th17 cells. Deletion or inhibition of LAT1 efficiently controls IL-23 and IL-1β-induced PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation, independent of TCR-signaling.Targeting LAT1-mediated amino  uptake is a potentially useful immunosuppressive strategy to control skin inflammation mediated by IL-23/IL-1β/IL-17 axis.Copyright © 2019.

Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) interaction is one of important therapeutic targets for . Here we analyzed the FA effects on IL-17A/IL-17RA interaction and -like skin injury induced by imiquimod (IMQ). IL-17A-blocking assay and docking analysis showed that FA interacted with Trp-67, Gln-94, and Glu-95 residues of IL-17A via hydrogen bonds and consequently abolished the binding of IL-17RA to IL-17A. Mice were topically given with IMQ and orally given with various amounts of FA for 14 consecutive days. FA attenuated IMQ-induced -like skin lesions in a dose-dependent manner, and the epidermal thickness of mice treated with 100 mg/kg FA was reduced by 53.48 ± 4.44% in comparison with sham. Global analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that IMQ and FA significantly affected immune response, metabolism, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Immunohistochemical staining showed that FA inhibited the infiltration and the cytokine secretion of Th17 cell, dendritic cell, and granulocyte subsets in psoriatic skin tissues. In conclusion, we newly identified that oral administration of FA protected against IMQ-induced psoriatic skin injury in mice. Moreover, its protection was associated with the interference of IL-17A/IL-17RA interaction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

There is currently no cure for rosacea, and it carries a significant negative psychosocial burden for afflicted patients. While there are a number of treatment modalities at the disposal of the clinician, clinical experience has suggested a need for updated treatments. The pathogenesis of rosacea is multifactorial; however, this paper will focus on the pivotal role of interleukin 17 (IL-17) in the development and progression of the disease. Furthermore, this paper will explore the mechanism of action of standard rosacea treatments and their effect on different stages of the IL-17 pathway. The standard treatments for rosacea are usually effective in controlling the symptoms of the disease in its mild-to-moderate form; however, their efficacy is diminished in the setting of severe and treatment-resistant rosacea. We hypothesize that IL-17 inhibitors, currently used successfully in  and psoriatic arthritis, could perhaps be used to treat severe and treatment-resistant papulopustular rosacea in the future; however, clinical trials and case reports will be needed to dictate expanded indications of IL-17 inhibitors. Furthermore, the high cost of IL-17 inhibitors presently prevents their use in disease states other than  or psoriatic arthritis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308681>Urinary orosomucoid: a new marker of cardiovascular risk in psoriatic patients?</a></h1><p> is one of the most common lifelong lasting dermatologic diseases.

Exclusion criteria were impaired renal function (eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m), acute inflammations (urinary, respiratory, skin inflammation, etc), autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or inflammatory bowel disease), and any kind of biological antipsoriatic treatment. Patients with a medical history of myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and carotid artery stenosis were also excluded. Biomarkers were measured by routine procedures, ELISA and HPLC.

On the other hand, redox signaling involving lipid peroxidation products acting as second messengers of free radicals play important yet not fully understood roles in the pathophysiology of inflammation and various stress-associated disorders. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the onset of oxidative stress and alterations of enzyme-dependent lipid metabolism resulting from redox imbalance in granulocytes and plasma obtained from patients with  vulgaris or psoriatic arthritis in comparison to the healthy subjects. The results obtained revealed enhanced activity of pro-oxidant enzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and xanthine oxidases in granulocytes with a decrease of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants in the plasma of psoriatic patients. The nuclear factor erythroid 2⁻related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its regulators were increased in both forms of  while heme oxygenase 1 levels were increased only in  vulgaris. The redox imbalance was associated with decreased levels of phospholipids and of free polyunsaturated fatty  but with enhanced activity of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism (phospholipase A2, acetylhydrolase PAF, cyclooxygenases 1 and 2) and increased lipid peroxidation products 4-hydroxynonenal, isoprostanes, and neuroprostanes. Increased endocannabinoids and G protein-coupled receptor 55 were observed in both forms of the disease while expression of the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1) was increased only in patients with psoriatic arthritis, which is opposite to the cannabinoid type 2 receptor. This receptor was increased only in  vulgaris. Changes in protein expression promoted the apoptosis of granulocytes by increased caspases mainly in  vulgaris. This study indicates that inhibition of the Nrf2 pathway in psoriatic arthritis promotes a redox imbalance. In addition, increased expression of CB1 receptors leads to increased oxidative stress, lipid modifications, and inflammation, which, in turn, may promote the progression of  into the advanced, arthritic form of the disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31429777>Lysophosphatidic  receptor 1 (LPA) plays critical roles in microglial activation and brain damage after transient focal cerebral ischemia.</a></h1><p>Lysophosphatidic  receptor 1 (LPA) is in the spotlight because its synthetic antagonist has been under clinical trials for lung fibrosis and . Targeting LPA might also be a therapeutic strategy for cerebral ischemia because LPA triggers microglial activation, a core pathogenesis in cerebral ischemia. Here, we addressed this possibility using a mouse model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO).To address the role of LPA in the ischemic brain damage, we used AM095, a selective LPA antagonist, as a pharmacological tool and lentivirus bearing a specific LPA shRNA as a genetic tool. Brain injury after tMCAO challenge was accessed by determining brain infarction and neurological deficit score. Role of LPA in tMCAO-induced microglial activation was ascertained by immunohistochemical analysis. Proinflammatory responses in the ischemic brain were determined by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses, which were validated in vitro using mouse primary microglia. Activation of MAPKs and PI3K/Akt was determined by Western blot analysis.AM095 administration immediately after reperfusion attenuated brain damage such as brain infarction and neurological deficit at 1 day after tMCAO, which was reaffirmed by LPA shRNA lentivirus. AM095 administration also attenuated brain infarction and neurological deficit at 3 days after tMCAO. LPA antagonism attenuated microglial activation; it reduced numbers and soma size of activated microglia, reversed their morphology into less toxic one, and reduced microglial proliferation. Additionally, LPA antagonism reduced mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines and suppressed NF-κB activation, demonstrating its regulatory role of proinflammatory responses in the ischemic brain. Particularly, these LPA-driven proinflammatory responses appeared to occur in activated microglia because NF-κB activation occurred mainly in activated microglia in the ischemic brain. Regulatory role of LPA in proinflammatory responses of microglia was further supported by in vitro findings using lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cultured microglia, showing that suppressing LPA activity reduced mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines. In the ischemic brain, LPA influenced PI3K/Akt and MAPKs; suppressing LPA activity decreased MAPK activation and increased Akt phosphorylation.This study demonstrates that LPA is a new etiological factor for cerebral ischemia, strongly indicating that its modulation can be a potential strategy to reduce ischemic brain damage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29929605>Drugs on the Horizon for Chronic Pruritus.</a></h1><p>Chronic pruritus is a common condition that has a detrimental impact on quality of life.

Its mild-to-moderate form, representing approximately 80% of the total cases, is treated by topical application, with corticosteroid being the standard treatment. However, in case of , no single treatment works for every patient and optimizing topical therapy is a key aspect. A possible alternative is represented by cyclosporine, an immunosuppressant cyclic peptide administered orally in the treatment of the severe form. Its topical application could avoid the problems related to systemic immunosuppression, but the unfavourable physico-chemical properties (MW: 1202 Da; LogP ≈ 3) hinder its permeation across the stratum corneum. The aim of the paper was the preparation, characterization and ex-vivo evaluation of cyclosporine loaded microemulsions using oleic  as oil phase, either Tween80 or a soluble derivative of vitamin E (TPGS) as surfactants and either Transcutol, propylene glycol or 1,3 propanediol as co-surfactants. The issue of formulation viscosity was also addressed 1) by evaluating the thickening of Tween80-based microemulsions by direct addition of different rheological modifiers, 2) by building pseudo-ternary phase diagrams using TPGS, to identify the water/oil/surfactants proportions resulting in viscous self-gelifying systems. Nine formulations (five Tween80-based and four TPGS-based) were selected, characterized in terms of droplets size (low viscosity systems) or rheological properties (high viscosity systems), loaded with 6 mg/g cyclosporine and applied ex-vivo on porcine skin for 22 h. A relevant skin accumulation was obtained either with a low-viscosity Tween80-based microemulsion (9.78 ± 3.86 µg/cm), or with a high viscosity TPGS-based microemulsion (18.3 ± 5.69 µg/cm), with an increase of about 3 and 6 times respectively for comparison with a control cyclosporine solution in propylene glycol. The role of water content, surfactant, co-surfactant and viscosity was also addressed and discussed. The kinetic of skin uptake from the best performing formulation was finally evaluated, highlighting a relatively quick skin uptake and the achievement, after 2 h of contact, of potentially therapeutic cyclosporine skin concentrations.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous 50 mg SDZ ETN or ETN, once-weekly, for 24 weeks. At week 24, patients with at least moderate EULAR response in the SDZ ETN group continued SDZ ETN treatment, and those in the ETN group were switched to receive 50 mg SDZ ETN, for up to 48 weeks. Patients received concomitant methotrexate at a stable dose (10-25 mg/week) and folic  (≥ 5 mg/week).

Herein, we present the 48-week results of the study after a single switch from ETN to its biosimilar at week 24.The least squares mean (standard error) change in DAS28-CRP from baseline up to week 48 was comparable between "continued SDZ ETN" (- 2.90 [0.12], n = 148) and "switched to SDZ ETN" (- 2.78 [0.13], n = 131) groups. The proportion of patients achieving EULAR good/moderate responses based on DAS28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate and ACR20/50/70 response rates were comparable between the two groups. The proportion of patients with at least one treatment-emergent adverse event was 42.9% in the "continued SDZ ETN" and 38.0% in the "switched to SDZ ETN" groups. Serious adverse events occurred in 4 patients in each of the two groups. After week 24, none of the patients in the switched group developed anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), while 4 patients in the continued SDZ ETN group had single-event, very low titer, non-neutralizing ADAs detected.The 48-week results from the EQUIRA study demonstrate that switch from ETN to SDZ ETN in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis does not impact the efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity of etanercept.EudraCT number 2012-002009-23 , Registered 19 April 2012-prospectively registered.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533077>Musa acuminata and its bioactive metabolite 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural mitigates quorum sensing (las and rhl) mediated biofilm and virulence production of nosocomial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro.</a></h1><p>Musa acuminata, a tropical plant belongs to the family Musaceae.

Further, the major compounds such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, vaccenic  and pentanoic  identified from active fraction of MAM were evaluated for their antibiofilm and antivirulence potential against P. aeruginosa.MAM significantly inhibited the biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa at 400 μg ml concentration which also inhibited the production of biofilm proteins, biofilm adherence, EPS and CSH productions to the level of 79%, 82% and 77% respectively. Further, the antivirulence potential was confirmed through numerous virulence inhibition assays. The MAM at 400 μg ml concentration inhibited the QS-mediated virulence production such as protease, LasA protease, LasB elastase, pyocyanin, alginate and rhamnolipid productions to the level of 77%, 75%, 68%, 80%, 78% and 69% respectively. Moreover, the results of qPCR analysis confirmed the downregulation of QS regulated virulence genes expression upon treatment with MAM. The chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5HMF), vaccenic  and pentanoic  in MAM and the potential bioactive compounds with antibiofilm and antivirulence was identified as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, without exerting any growth inhibition in P. aeruginosa.This study investigated the ideal antibiofilm and antivirulence potential of MAM and its bioactive compound 5HMF, and confirms the ethnopharmacological value of these peels against P. aeruginosa infections.Copyright © 2019.

The molecular mechanisms of these beneficial effects are only partially understood. DHA and EPA activate  (GPR120/FFA4). Recently, the first orally available, synthetic ligand of FFA4, 3-[2-chloro-5-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-3-azaspiro[5.5]undecane-9-acetic  ("compound A"; cpd A) has been developed. Cpd A exhibits distinctly higher potency, efficiency, and selectivity at FFA4 than ω3-PUFAs and ameliorates insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation in the mouse. With GPR120/FFA4 activation believed to also attenuate tissue inflammation in autoimmune diseases, cpd A may also have a beneficial effect in these diseases. We have therefore addressed the therapeutic potential of cpd A in mouse models of three prototypical autoimmune diseases, specifically , rheumatoid arthritis, and bullous pemphigoid. The effect of cpd A on the course of Aldara™-induced -like dermatitis, K/BxN serum transfer arthritis, and antibody transfer pemphigoid disease-like dermatitis was scrutinized. Cpd A did not alter the course of Aldara-induced -like dermatitis, K/BxN serum transfer arthritis, or antibody transfer pemphigoid disease-like dermatitis. Our results suggest that therapeutic regimens solely relying on FFA4 activation do not bear the potential to treat inflammatory diseases. With cpd A distinctly more potent in activating GPR120/FFA4 than ω3-PUFAs, this also suggests that GPR120/FFA4 activation by ω3-PUFAs does not significantly contribute to the health-promoting effects of ω3-PUFAs in autoimmune diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30584899>The role of lysophosphatidic  in the physiology and pathology of the skin.</a></h1><p>Lysophosphatidic  (LPA) is the simplest phospholipid found in nature. LPA is mainly biosynthesized in tissues and cells by autotoxin and PA-PLA1α/PA-PLA1β and is degraded by lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs). It is an important component of biofilm, an extracellular signal transmitter and intracellular second messenger. After targeting to endothelial differentiation gene (Edg) family LPA receptors (LPA1, LPA2, LPA3) and non-Edg family LPA receptors (LPA4, LPA5, LPA6), LPA mediates physiological and pathological processes such as embryonic development, angiogenesis, tumor progression, fibrogenesis, wound healing, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and inflammatory reactions. These processes are induced through signaling pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, protein kinase C (PKC)-GSK3β-β-catenin, Rho, Stat, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α). LPA is involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes in the skin. It not only regulates skin function but also plays an important role in hair follicle development, skin wound healing, pruritus, skin tumors, and scleroderma. Pharmacological inhibition of LPA synthesis or antagonization of LPA receptors is a new strategy for the treatment of various skin disorders.

In this review, we discuss recent advances in photoimmunology, focusing on the effects of UV-based therapies currently used in dermatology. We describe the molecular responses to the main forms of photo(chemo)therapy such as UVB, UVA-1, and PUVA that include the triggering of apoptotic or immunosuppressive pathways and help to clear diseased skin. The early molecular response to UV involves DNA photoproducts, the isomerization of urocanic , the secretion of biophospholipids such as platelet activating factor (PAF), the activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor and inflammasome, and vitamin D synthesis. The simultaneous and complex interaction of these events regulates the activity of the immune system both locally and systemically, resulting in apoptosis of neoplastic and/or benign cells, reduction of cellular infiltrate, and regulation of cytokines and chemokines. Regulatory T-cells and Langerhans cells, among other skin-resident cellular populations, are deeply affected by UV exposure and are therefore important players in the mechanisms of immunomodulation and the therapeutic value of UV in all its forms. We weigh the contribution of these cells to the therapeutic application of UV and how they may participate in transferring the direct impact of UV on the skin into local and systemic immunomodulation. Moreover, we review the therapeutic mechanisms revealed by clinical and laboratory animal investigations in the most common cutaneous diseases treated with phototherapy such as , atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Better understanding of phototherapeutic mechanisms in these diseases will help advance treatment in general and make future therapeutic strategies more precise, targeted, personalized, safe, and efficient.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443157>Derailed Ceramide Metabolism in Atopic Dermatitis (AD): A Causal Starting Point for a Personalized (Basic) Therapy.</a></h1><p>Active rebuilding, stabilizing, and maintaining the lipid barrier of the skin is an encouraging disease management and care concept for dry skin, atopic dermatitis (eczema, neurodermatitis), and . For decades, corticosteroids have been the mainstay of topical therapy for atopic dermatitis; however, innovations within the scope of basic therapy are rare. In (extremely) dry, irritated, or inflammatory skin, as well as in lesions, an altered (sphingo)lipid profile is present. Recovery of a balanced (sphingo)lipid profile is a promising target for topical and personalized treatment and prophylaxis. New approaches for adults and small children are still lacking. With an ingenious combination of commonly used active ingredients, it is possible to restore and reinforce the dermal lipid barrier and maintain refractivity. Lysosomes and ceramide de novo synthesis play a key role in attenuation of the dermal lipid barrier. Linoleic  in combination with amitriptyline in topical medication offers the possibility to relieve patients affected by dry and itchy skin, mild to moderate atopic dermatitis lesions, and eczemas without the commonly occurring serious adverse effects of topical corticosteroids or systemic antibody administration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30268505>Novel biosensor using split-luciferase for detecting vitamin D receptor ligands based on the interaction between vitamin D receptor and coactivator.</a></h1><p>Vitamin D receptor (VDR) ligands, such as 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1α,25(OH)D] and its analogs, have been investigated for their potential clinical use in the treatment of various diseases such as type I rickets, osteoporosis, , leukemia, and cancer. Previously, we reported a split-luciferase-based biosensor that can detect VDR ligands and assess their affinity for the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the VDR in a short time. However, a further increase in its sensitivity was required to detect plasma levels of 1α,25(OH)D and its analogs. In this study, a novel type of biosensor called LXXLL + LBD was successfully developed. Here, the split luciferase forms a functional complex based on the intermolecular interaction between the LXXLL motif and the ligand-bound form of the LBD. This biosensor has an approximately 10-fold increase in the light intensity compared to the previous versions. Additionally, the binding affinity of the vitamin D analogs for the wild-type and the rickets-associated mutant R274L of VDR was evaluated.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Current treatment for  relies on conventional immunosuppressive agents. However, long-term treatment with global immunosuppression may cause various side effects. Thus, it is compelling to seek alternative drugs for treating  with potentially less side effects. Betulinic  (BA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpene, an ingredient that originally exists in natural plants and lacks systemic toxicity. BA can regulate immunity with anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, it's unknown whether BA has a therapeutic effect on . The objectives of this study were to investigate whether BA attenuates psoriatic skin inflammation and to identify its mechanisms of action. A murine model of imiquimod-induced  was utilized to evaluate skin lesion while flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses were performed for immunoassays. We found that BA treatment alleviated psoriatic symptoms and inflammatory skin lesion. BA lowered the PASI scores, decreased epidermal thickness and reduced T cell infiltration in the skin lesion. Moreover, BA reduced the frequency of IL-17A-expressing CD4 and γδ T cells in psoriatic mice, but did not alter CD4FoxP3 Treg frequency. BA also reduced IL-17A production but increased anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 level in serum of the psoriatic mice. Furthermore, BA inhibited gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in skin lesions, including RORγt, IL-17A, IL-6 and TNFα. Importantly, it suppressed NFκB signaling in the skin lesion. Finally, BA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-17A production by CD4 T-Cells in vitro. Thus, BA attenuates  and inhibits Th17 development.Copyright © 2019.

Aim of the study was to investigate the diagnostic value of serum liver fatty -binding protein (FABP1) level and associations with disease severity, inflammation or metabolic parameters and influence of systemic treatment in psoriatic patients. The study included thirty-three patients with active plaque-type  and eleven healthy volunteers. Blood samples were obtained before and after 12 weeks of therapy with methotrexate and acitretin. Serum FABP1 concentrations were analyzed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Statistical analysis was performed for correlation of FABP1 with anthropometric, metabolic or inflammatory indices and treatment used. Serum liver-type FABP levels were significantly increased in psoriatic patients compared to the controls (p < 0.001). No statistical correlations between FABP1 and PASI (p = 0.25) was noted, however patients with severe  had the highest level of FABP1. No significance with metabolic parameters was obtained, beside a positive significant relation with BMI after therapy (p = 0.03). Liver-type FABP significantly correlated with CRP (p = 0.01) and morphotic blood elements.

Inhibition of cell proliferation is explained through its role in blocking DNA/RNA synthesis, by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, necessary for the production of pyrimidine and purine nucleotides. An anticancer effect can be related to α-oxoaldehyde metabolism (MTX increases methylglyoxal levels). Its anti-inflammatory property is based on the inhibition of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase, thus increasing intracellular and extracellular adenosine, a purine nucleoside with anti-inflammatory effect. This drug can limit inflammation by scavenging free radicals and decreasing malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde protein-adduct production. Moreover, the anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects can also be related to inhibition of the DNA methylation pathway, thus inhibiting methionine formation. The aim of the present study was to report various dermatological cases from our daily practice that demonstrate the efficacy of MTX in the treatment of cutaneous diseases, highlighting different mechanisms of action: its anti-inflammatory effect in  and its anti-proliferative, and anti-neoplastic effect in well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma or in keratoacanthoma.

For gene delivery application, dendrimers are considered as efficient carrier due to their cationic nature and well-defined surface groups. However, they are not well explored for topical delivery. This work compares the suitability of PAMAM dendrimer with DOTAP liposome for topical delivery of siRNA against TNF-α. The particle size, zeta potential and entrapment efficiency of dendriplex were 99.80 ± 1.80 nm, 13.40 ± 4.84 mV and 98.72 ± 2.02% whereas for lipoplex were 174.80 ± 0.80 nm, 29.96 ± 0.51 mV and 94.99 ± 5.01% respectively. Both the formulations were stable in serum and in the presence of RNAse. TNF-α is inflammatory cytokine, hence the in vivo efficacy of developed formulations was determined using psoriatic plaque model. Results suggested improved phenotypic and histopathological features and reduced levels of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-17 and IL-22 for dendriplex and lipoplex treated groups in comparison to Imiquimod treated group. These findings suggest that dendrimer can be a potential carrier for topical gene delivery.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Its treatment is challenged by the limited amount of drug reaching the inflamed skin. The overexpressed CD44 protein in inflamed psoriatic skin can serve as a potential target of novel active-targeting nanocarriers to increase drug accumulation in the skin.  Hyaluronic  (HA) was linked to propylene glycol-based ethosomes by covalent binding to develop a novel topical drug delivery carrier (HA-ES) for curcumin. An imiquimod-induced  mouse model was established, and curcumin delivery and anti-psoriatic efficacy using HA-ES were compared with those using plain ethosomes (ES).  The HA gel network formed on the surface of HA-ES reduced the leakage and release of poorly water-soluble curcumin. Compared with ES, transdermal curcumin delivery was significantly enhanced by using HA-ES as vehicles; the cumulative transdermal amount and the amount retained in the skin  after 8 h were, respectively, 1.6 and 1.4 times those observed with ES, as well as 3.1 and 3.3 times those observed with a curcumin propylene glycol solution (PGS), respectively. The  psoriatic skin retention of curcumin with HA-ES was 2.3 and 4.0 times that of ES and PGS, respectively. CD44 expression in imiquimod-induced -like inflamed skin was 2.7 times that in normal skin. Immunostaining revealed similar results, suggesting that the specific adhesion of HA-ES to CD44 increased drug accumulation in the skin. After topical administration to mice, the HA-ES group showed an alleviation of inflammation symptoms; lower TNF-α, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, and IL-1β mRNA levels; and lower CCR6 protein expression compared to the ES and PGS groups.  We demonstrated increased topical drug delivery of curcumin to inflamed tissues using HA-ES targeting the highly expressed CD44 protein.

Recently, they have shown promise for use in treating inflammatory skin disease as, unlike antibody-based biologics, they are able to enter the skin following topical administration. However, it is important to understand the inflammatory milieu into which aptamers are delivered, as numerous immune-modulating mediators will be present at abnormal levels. LL-37 is an important immune-modifying protein upregulated in several inflammatory skin conditions, including , rosacea and eczema. This inflammatory antimicrobial peptide is known to complex nucleic  and induce both inflammatory and interferon responses from keratinocytes. Given the attractive notion of using RNA aptamers in topical medication and the prevalence of LL-37 in these inflammatory skin conditions, we examined the effect of LL-37 on the efficacy and safety of the anti-IL-17A RNA aptamer, Apt 21-2. LL-37 was demonstrated to complex with the RNA aptamer by electrophoretic mobility shift and filter binding assays. In contrast to free Apt 21-2, LL-37-complexed Apt 21-2 was observed to efficiently enter both keratinocytes and fibroblasts by confocal microscopy. Despite internalization of LL-37-complexed aptamers, measurement of inflammatory mediators and interferon stimulated genes showed LL-37-complexed Apt 21-2 remained immunologically inert in keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells including infiltrating dendritic cells and monocytes. The findings of this study suggest RNA aptamers delivered into an inflammatory milieu rich in LL-37 may become complexed and subsequently internalized by surrounding cells in the skin. Whilst the results of this study indicate delivery of RNA aptamers into tissue rich in LL-37 should not cause an unwarranted inflammatory of interferon response, these results have significant implications for the efficacy of aptamers with regards to extracellular vs. intracellular targets that should be taken into consideration when developing treatment strategies utilizing RNA aptamers in inflamed tissue.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31419462>Development, characterization and evaluation of topical methotrexate-entrapped deformable liposome on imiquimod-induced  in a mouse model.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to prepare and characterize topical methotrexate (MTX) with different percentages (0.05%, 0.1%, 0.25% and 0.5%) entrapped in deformable liposomes using phosphatidylcholine and oleic . The effectiveness and sub-acute toxicity of these topical formulations were investigated in imiquimod (IMQ)-induced  in a mouse model (IMQP). The particle sizes of formulations were around 100 nm with a mean zeta potential of -72.87 mV. The entrapment efficiency (EE%) of MTX in liposomal formulations were more than 85%. Franz cell permeability studies indicated that permeation of MTX through the healthy BALB/c mice skin is very low; however, in the inflammatory skin, which was induced by IMQ it was significant (50%). Liposomal MTX (LM 0.05 and 0.1%) caused significant reduction of thickness score dose-dependently in IMQP compared to the injected MTX. Moreover, investigation of the inflammatory factor and pathological examinations of skin proved the superiority of the LM treating group. Pathological examinations also showed there are no toxicity in organs of the mice that received the LM. Blood cell count test didn't show any abnormality.

Vitamin D derivatives (VDDs) - active metabolites 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D2) and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D3) and their analogs - are differentiation-inducing agents which have potential for the therapy of AML. However, calcemic toxicity of VDDs limits their clinical use at doses effective against cancer cells in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that in AML cell cultures, moderate pro-differentiation effects of low concentrations of VDDs can be synergistically enhanced by structurally distinct compounds known to activate the transcription factor Nuclear Factor (Erythroid-derived 2)-Like 2 (NFE2L2 or Nrf2). Particularly, dimethyl fumarate (DMF), which is clinically approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and , strongly cooperated with 1,25D3, PRI-5100 (19-nor-1,25D2; paricalcitol) and PRI-5202 (a double-point modified 19-nor analog of 1,25D2). The pro-differentiation synergy between VDDs (1,25D3 or PRI-5202) and Nrf2 activators (DMF, tert-butylhydroquinone or carnosic ) was associated with a cooperative upregulation of the protein levels of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and Nrf2 as well as increased mRNA expression of their respective target genes. These data support the notion that VDDs and Nrf2 activators synergize in inducing myeloid cell differentiation through the cooperative activation of the VDR and Nrf2/antioxidant response element signaling pathways. We have previously reported that PRI-5202 is more potent by approximately two orders of magnitude than 1,25D3 as a differentiation inducer in AML cell lines. In this study, we found that PRI-5202 was also at least 5-fold less calcemic in healthy mice compared to both its direct precursor PRI-1907 and 1,25D3. In addition, PRI-5202 was remarkably more resistant against degradation by the human 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase than both 1,25D2 and 1,25D3. Importantly, using a xenograft mouse model we demonstrated that co-administration of PRI-5202 and DMF resulted in a marked cooperative inhibition of human AML tumor growth without inducing treatment toxicity. Collectively, our findings provide a rationale for clinical testing of low-toxic VDD/DMF combinations as a novel approach for differentiation therapy of AML.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Some of the most noxious pollutants that humans are exposed to include ozone (O ), particulate matter (PM), and cigarette smoke (CS). Since the skin is the first line of defense against environmental insults, it is considered one of the main target organs for the harmful insults of air pollution. Thus, there is solid evidence that skin pathologies such as premature aging, atopic dermatitis (AD), and  are associated with pollutant exposure; all of these skin conditions are also associated with an altered redox status. Therefore, although the mechanisms of action and concentrations of O , PM, and CS that we are exposed to differ, exposure to all of these pollutants is associated with the development of similar skin conditions due to the fact that all of these pollutants alter redox homeostasis, increasing reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress. A main product of oxidative stress, induced by exposure to the aforementioned pollutants, is 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), which derives from the oxidation of ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty . HNE is a highly reactive compound that can form adducts with cellular proteins and even DNA; it is also an efficient cell signaling molecule able to regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and the activity of redox-sensitive transcription factors such as Nrf2, AP1, and NFκB. Therefore, increased levels of HNE in the skin, in response to pollutants, likely accelerates skin aging and exacerbates existing skin inflammatory conditions; thus, targeting HNE formation could be an innovative cosmeceutical approach for topical applications.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30070708>Infliximab is associated with an increased risk of serious infection in patients with  in the U.K. and Republic of Ireland: results from the British Association of Dermatologists Biologic Interventions Register (BADBIR).</a></h1><p>Patients with  and clinicians are concerned that infliximab may be associated with a risk of serious infections.To compare the risk of serious infections associated with infliximab in patients with chronic plaque  against a cohort on nonbiologic systemic therapies.A prospective cohort study was performed using data from the British Association of Dermatologists Biologic Interventions Register (BADBIR).

In conclusion, the miRNA profile, together with other 'omics', may constitute a multifaceted approach to explore the impact of diet on  prevention and treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30680823>Fumaric  ester-induced T-cell lymphopenia in the real-life treatment of .</a></h1><p>Fumaric  esters (FAEs) are used to treat  and are known to cause lymphopenia in roughly 60% of the patients. Much remains to be elucidated about the biological effects of FAEs on lymphocytes.To evaluate the influence of long-term FAE (Fumaderm ) treatment on peripheral blood CD4 and CD8 T cells, CD19 B cells and CD56 natural killer (NK) cells in .In this single-centre retrospective observational subcohort study, we obtained leucocyte and lymphocyte subset counts before initiating FAE therapy in 371  patients (mean age, 47.8 years; 63.3% males) and monitored them during treatment (mean treatment duration, 2.9 years). Multiparametric flow cytometry was used for immunophenotyping.FAEs significantly reduced the numbers of CD4 T, CD8 T, CD19 B and CD56 NK cells. Among lymphocyte subsets, the mean percentage reduction from baseline was always highest for CD8 T cells, with a peak of 55.7% after 2 years of therapy. The risk of T-cell lymphopenia increased significantly with the age of the  patients at the time that FAE therapy was initiated. It was significantly decreased for the combination therapy with methotrexate and folic  (vitamin B9) supplementation. Supporting evidence was found suggesting that T-cell lymphopenia enhances the effectiveness of FAE therapy.Monitoring distinct T-cell subsets rather than just absolute lymphocyte counts may provide more meaningful insights into both the FAE treatment safety and efficacy. We therefore suggest optimizing pharmacovigilance by additionally monitoring CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts at regular intervals, especially in patients of middle to older age. Thus, further prospective studies are needed to establish evidence-based recommendations to guide dermatologists in the management of  patients who are taking FAEs and who develop low absolute T-cell counts.© 2019 The Authors.

Part I: Diffusion of Amino  Into the Isolated Corneocytes.</a></h1><p>Amino  (AAs), important constituents of natural moisturizing factors (NMFs) of the skin are decreased in diseased conditions such as  and atopic dermatitis. No study so far investigated the uptake of AAs into isolated corneocytes (COR). The present study was performed using 19 AAs, including taurine (TAU), to measure their amount diffused into the COR and binding of these AAs to keratin. Incubation of alanine, aspartic , asparagine, glutamine, glutamic , histidine, proline, serine and TAU with the isolated COR showed uptake after 24 h of 51.6, 95.4, 98.6, 94.1, 95.6, 90.1, 94.6, 72.9 and 57.8 %, respectively, into the COR but no binding with keratin. Uptake of TAU was validated by time dependent  diffusion models 'without COR and 'with COR'. The time dependent curve fitting showed that in  diffusion model 'without COR' there was no change in the total concentration of TAU until 72 hours, while in diffusion model 'with COR' the total conc. decreased to 37.8 % after 72 hours. The Pearson's correlation coefficient 'r' between the conc. curves of both  diffusion models was -0.54 that was an evidence of significant amount of TAU uptake by the COR. AAs as part of the NMFs have a great potential to be diffused into the COR. This property of the AAs can be employed in further dermatological research on diseased or aged skin conditions with NMFs deficiency.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30446200>Use of antiepileptic mood stabilizers in dermatology.</a></h1><p>Several antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of bipolar disorder (valproic , divalproex, lamotrigine, carbamazepine) and some cutaneous neuropathic pain syndromes (carbamazepine, gabapentin, pregabalin). The AEDs may be effective in the management of (1) chronic pruritus, including pruritus due systemic disease, including uremia, neuropathic pain, neuropathic pruritus, and complex cutaneous sensory syndromes, especially where central nervous system (CNS) sensitization plays a role; (2) management of emotional dysregulation and the resultant repetitive self-excoriation or other cutaneous self-injury in patients who repetitively stimulate or manipulate their integument to regulate emotions (prurigo nodularis, lichen simplex chronicus, skin picking disorder, trichotillomania); (3) management of dermatologic clinical manifestations associated with autonomic nervous system activation (hyperhidrosis, urticaria, flushing; these often occur in conjunction with psychiatric disorders with prominent autonomic activation and dysregulation, eg, social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder); and (4) when certain anticonvulsants have a direct therapeutic effect (eg, in ); currently the use of AEDs for such cases is largely experimental. Gabapentin (dosage range 300-3600 mg daily) is the most widely studied AED mood stabilizer in dermatology and is especially effective in situations where CNS sensitization is a mediating factor. Further larger-scale controlled studies of AEDs in dermatology are necessary.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Besides, we also confirmed a significant alleviation of ALA-PDT therapy on IFN-γ-induced over-proliferation of keratinocytes.H&E staining was conducted to reveal the histological changes of mice in different groups. The different expression levels of RNA were illustrated by using QRT-PCR. Western blot was performed to confirm the various expression levels of protein in mice. In vitro, cell proliferation and cell cycle were evaluated by cell counting kit-8 and flow cytometry assay, respectively.The result showed that ALA-PDT's anti-proliferation effect and regulation on Socs1/3, JAK1/2 and K17 in IFN-γ-induced keratinocytes were largely weakened by NAC, indicating that ALA-PDT attenuated the proliferation of IFN-γ-induced keratinocytes by enhancing ROS level.These results demonstrated that ALA-PDT largely activated the productivity of Socs1/3 in a ROS-dependent manner.

However, the development of non-caseating granulomas with the use of monoclonal antibodies, such as ustekinumab, is not widely reported in the literature.We report a case of a 50-year-old Caucasian male who presented complaining of weight loss and shortness of breath. He was receiving ustekinumab for refractory  but had no other significant medical comorbidities. On physical examination, reduced breath sounds on the right side were noted. Blood cultures were drawn on presentation and came back negative in 48 hours. A chest computed tomography scan revealed a large right lung mass in addition to right-sided pleural effusion. Therapeutic thoracocentesis was done; fluid cytology and analysis were negative for malignancy, -fast bacilli, or fungal infections. A positron emission tomography scan showed multifocal radiotracer uptake including within right lung mass, multiple bones, lymph nodes, liver and spleen. Biopsies showed hyalinized non-necrotizing granulomas. Immunohistochemical stains for AE1/AE3, cytokeratin 7 and 20, and thyroid transcription factor 1, were all negative. He was started on steroid therapy, and ustekinumab was discontinued and the follow-up computed tomography after a few months showed substantial improvement. However, over the course of next 4 months patient developed hepatic dysfunction and recurrent ascites and ultimately underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement. Furthermore, he was started on azathioprine and steroids were tapered.

Inflammatory macrophages undergo extensive metabolic rewiring  marked by the production of substantial amounts of itaconate, which has recently been described as an immunoregulatory metabolite  . Itaconate and its membrane-permeable derivative dimethyl itaconate (DI) selectively inhibit a subset of cytokines  , including IL-6 and IL-12 but not TNF. The major effects of itaconate on cellular metabolism during macrophage activation have been attributed to the inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase, yet this inhibition alone is not sufficient to account for the pronounced immunoregulatory effects observed in the case of DI. Furthermore, the regulatory pathway responsible for such selective effects of itaconate and DI on the inflammatory program has not been defined. Here we show that itaconate and DI induce electrophilic stress, react with glutathione and subsequently induce both Nrf2 (also known as NFE2L2)-dependent and -independent responses. We find that electrophilic stress can selectively regulate secondary, but not primary, transcriptional responses to toll-like receptor stimulation via inhibition of IκBζ protein induction. The regulation of IκBζ is independent of Nrf2, and we identify ATF3 as its key mediator. The inhibitory effect is conserved across species and cell types, and the in vivo administration of DI can ameliorate IL-17-IκBζ-driven skin pathology in a mouse model of , highlighting the therapeutic potential of this regulatory pathway. Our results demonstrate that targeting the DI-IκBζ regulatory axis could be an important new strategy for the treatment of IL-17-IκBζ-mediated autoimmune diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30863024>Willingness-to-pay and benefit-cost analysis of chemical peels for acne treatment in China.</a></h1><p>There have been few studies on economic evaluation of acne treatments. Chemical peel (CP), a treatment approach primarily aimed at removing acne hyperpigmentation and scarring, is gradually accepted in the Chinese market.This study aimed to detect willingness-to-pay (WTP) and to conduct a benefit-cost analysis for CP treatment among Chinese acne patients.The costs were obtained from the patient's perspective and compared with benefits. The net benefits were approximated by WTP, using the contingent valuation method. A glycolic  peel served as the demonstrated example. WTP and related information were inquired via an online questionnaire among the Chinese population. Factors for WTP were identified using generalized linear models. The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) was calculated. Discounting was not considered for both WTP and costs.The response rate of the survey was 95.4% among the 476 anonymous participants. The average cost for three-time CP treatment was USD 383.4. Statistically significant differences in WTP among the cases were identified. The mean WTP for Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3 was USD 234.6, 222.0, and 401.7, respectively. A statistically significant association between WTP and self-reported acne severity was observed for all cases after adjustments for demographic characteristics (<0.01). The Cardiff Acne Disability Index was positively associated with WTP. The BCRs were 0.61, 0.58, and 1.4 for Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3, respectively.Patients with acne in China are willing to pay for acne treatment. Although the benefits of CP treatment have not generally outweighed their aggregated costs, WTP for CP treatment was positively associated with self-reported acne severity and desirable efficacy of treatment.

A third of psoriatic patients develop PsA  unknown mechanisms. No reliable diagnostic markers are available for PsA, or prognostic biomarkers for PsA development in . We previously uncovered a pro-inflammatory role for cathelicidin LL37 in lesional  skin. LL37 binds nucleic  and stimulates plasmacytoid/myeloid dendritic cells (pDC, mDCs) to secrete type I interferon (IFN-I) and pro-inflammatory factors. LL37 becomes an autoantigen for psoriatic Th1-Th17/CD8 T cells. Anti-LL37 antibodies were detected in systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease characterized by neutrophil-extracellular-traps release (NETosis) in target organs. LL37 can be substrate of irreversible post-translational modifications, citrullination or carbamylation, linked to neutrophil activity. Here we analyzed inflammatory factors, included LL37, in PsA and  plasma and PsA synovial fluids (SF)/biopsies. We show that LL37 (as a product of infiltrating neutrophils) and autoantibodies to LL37 are elevated in PsA, but not OA SF. Anti-LL37 antibodies correlate with clinical inflammatory markers. Anti-carbamylated/citrullinated-LL37 antibodies are present in PsA SF/plasma and, at lower extent, in  plasma, but not in controls. Plasma anti-carbamylated-LL37 antibodies correlate with PsA (DAS44) but not  (PASI) disease activity. Ectopic lymphoid structures, and deposition of immunoglobulin-(Ig)G-complexes (IC) co-localizing with infiltrating neutrophils, are observed in PsA and not OA synovial tissues (ST). Activated complement (C5a, C9), GM-CSF and IFN-I are up-regulated in PsA and not OA synovia and in PsA and  plasma but not in HD. C9 and GM-CSF levels in PsA SF correlate with clinical inflammatory markers and DAS44 (C9) and with anti-carbamylated/citrullinated-LL37 antibodies (GM-CSF and IFN-I). Thus, we uncover a role for LL37 as a novel PsA autoantibody target and correlation studies suggest participation of anti-LL37 antibodies to PsA pathogenesis. Notably, plasma antibodies to carbamylated-LL37, which correlate with DAS44, suggest their use as new disease activity markers. GM-CSF and complement C5a and C9 elevation may be responsible for autoantigens release by neutrophils and their modification, fueling inflammation and autoreactivity establishment. Finally, targeting GM-CSF, C5a, C9 can be beneficial in PsA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30472749>Calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate aerosol foam vs. apremilast, methotrexate, acitretin or fumaric  esters for the treatment of plaque : a matching-adjusted indirect comparison.</a></h1><p>Plaque  has significant impact on patients' quality of life. Topical therapy is considered the treatment mainstay for mild-to-moderate disease according to guidelines. Calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (Cal/BD) [0.005%/0.05%] aerosol foam is indicated for  vulgaris treatment in adults. Cal/BD foam trials demonstrated improved efficacy and similar safety in this population.  treatment is complicated by the broad range of disease presentation, variability and therapeutic options; particularly decisions on transition from topical to non-biologic systemic treatment are difficult. Assessing comparative effectiveness of treatment options provides meaningful value to treatment decisions.To compare efficacy of Cal/BD foam individual patient data from pooled trials with efficacy of non-biologic systemic treatments based on aggregated patient characteristics and treatment outcomes.Individual data from four Cal/BD foam trials in 749  patients were pooled to conduct matching-adjusted indirect comparisons. Literature review identified non-biologic systemic treatment trials where methods, populations and outcomes align with Cal/BD foam trials. Of 3090 screened publications, four studies of apremilast, methotrexate, acitretin or fumaric  esters (FAE) were included.After baseline matching, patients treated with 4 weeks of Cal/BD foam had greater Physician's Global Assessment 0/1 response compared to those treated with 16 weeks of apremilast (52.7% vs. 30.4%; P < 0.001). Patients treated with Cal/BD foam had significantly greater  Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 response at Week 4 compared to 16 weeks of apremilast treatment (51.1% vs. 21.6%; P < 0.001).

The transcription factor Grainyhead-like 3 (GRHL3) is essential for maintaining barrier integrity and preventing development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC); however, how loss of this factor, which in the skin is expressed exclusively within suprabasal epidermal layers triggers proliferation of basal keratinocytes, had thus far remained elusive. Our present study identifies thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) as a novel soluble chemokine mediator of keratinocyte proliferation following loss of GRHL3. Knockdown of GRHL3 in human keratinocytes showed that of 42 cytokines examined, TARC was the only significantly upregulated chemokine. Mouse skin lacking Grhl3 presented an inflammatory response with hallmarks of TARC activation, including heightened induction of blood clotting, increased infiltration of mast cells and pro-inflammatory T cells, increased expression of the pro-proliferative/pro-inflammatory markers CD3 and pSTAT3, and significantly elevated basal keratinocyte proliferation. Treatment of skin cultures lacking Grhl3 with the broad spectrum anti-inflammatory 5-aminosalicylic  (5ASA) partially restored epidermal differentiation, indicating that abnormal keratinocyte proliferation/differentiation balance is a key driver of barrier dysfunction following loss of Grhl3, and providing a promising therapeutic avenue in the treatment of GRHL3-mediated epidermal disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30544400>Complete clinical and functional recovery following low-dose methotrexate related paraparesis in a patient with compound c.1298A>C AND c.677C>T MTHFR polymorphism: A case report.</a></h1><p>The mechanisms of action of MTX (methotrexate) in the treatment of RA (rheumatoid arthritis) and PsA (psoriatic arthritis) is related to its antifolic activity, due to the high affinity for enzymes that require folate cofactors as dihydrofolate reductase and to the anti-inflammatory activity derivated from the inhibition of thymidylate synthetase that leads to the over-production of adenosine.Our patient was a 41-year-old female, affected by PsA in treatment since 2 years with low-dose methylprednisolone and low-dose subcutaneous MTX. The treatment was effective. The patient subacutely developed a severe paraparesis with impossibility of gait or standing without aid and was admitted to a Neurology Department where the cause of the paraparesis was not clear in spite of accurate radiological neurophysiologic and laboratory tests. Therefore, she was admitted in a rehabilitation unit.Paraparesis in PsA patient in treatment with methotrexate. MTX toxicity was hypothesized; therefore the drug was discontinued while i.m. folic  and cyanocobalamin were administered for 20 days. The diagnosis was clinical, based on neurological examination (paraparesis) and on the chronic use of MTX (hypothesis of toxicity).The patient obtained a complete resolution of paraparesis. Genetic analyses showed associated a compound heterozygosity for the c.1298A>C and c.677C>T variants of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene.Neurological side effects of MTX are uncommon. In literature no previous case of MTX induced paraparesis in patients treated with low-dose MTX for chronic arthritis has been described. The association between the gene polymorphisms of MTHFR (c.1298A>C and c.677C>T) and MTX toxicity in arthritis patients is confirmed.

It is characterized by widespread skin erythema, scaling, pustules, or exfoliation of more than 75% of the body's surface area. This condition has life-threatening complications to include hemodynamic, metabolic, immunologic, and thermoregulatory disturbances. One metabolic complication, hyperuricemia, occurs from rapid keratinocyte differentiation and infiltration of inflammatory cells into psoriatic lesions. Although renal injury caused by shunting of blood to the skin has been reported, there are no reports of erythrodermic  causing crystal-induced nephropathy. We present a case of erythrodermic  and hyperuricemia complicated by uric  crystal nephropathy.A 57-year-old male with long-standing psoriatic arthritis presented with diffuse scaling of his skin. He was being treated with adalimumab, leflunomide, and topical clobetasol, but had recently stopped taking his medications. Physical exam revealed yellow scaling covering his entire body with underlying erythema and tenderness without mucosal involvement. Labs were notable for a creatinine of 3.3 mg/dL, with no prior history of renal disease, and uric  of 12.7 mg/dL. He was admitted to the intensive care unit given >80% of body surface area involvement and acute renal failure. Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation, renal function did not improve, and creatinine peaked at 4.61 mg/dL. Urine microscopy showed diffuse polymorphic uric  crystals, consistent with uric  crystal-induced nephropathy. He was started on rasburicase, urinary alkalinization, and fluids. His renal function improved dramatically; urine output, uric , and electrolytes normalized. He was discharged on topical clobetasol and leflunomide and started on secukinumab with little to no skin involvement.This case presents the rare complication of crystal-induced nephropathy in a patient with erythrodermic . Uric  crystal nephropathy is well described in diseases with rapid cell turnover such as tumor lysis syndrome. It is thought that rapid keratinocyte differentiation and inflammatory infiltration of psoriatic lesions produced life-threatening electrolyte abnormalities similar to tumor lysis syndrome. Early recognition of this rare complication is critical, and aggressive fluid resuscitation, urine alkalinization, and uric  lowering agents should be administered immediately.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30745980>Efficacy of Oral Low-Dose Isotretinoin in the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris in Vietnam.</a></h1><p>Oral isotretinoin is an effective therapy for acne.

Transdermal drug delivery offers a desirable alternative to the conventional approaches, but the performances of current available skin penetration enhancement techniques are not so satisfactory. To address these limitations, we developed a dissolving microneedle (MN) patch made of hyaluronic  (HA) with excellent water-solubility, biocompatibility, biodegradability and mechanical property. The amount of MTX encapsulated in the needles of the patch could be controlled during fabrication process for precise dosage. Interestingly, the MTX-loaded MNs successfully penetrated imiquimod (IMQ)-induced thickened epidermis in mice and delivered the drug intralesionally. Meanwhile, fast dissolution of HA endowed the MNs with operability for patients. We found the MTX-loaded MNs not only showed well-maintained inhibitory effect in vitro but also alleviated the -like skin inflammation in mice. Moreover, the MTX-loaded MNs were significantly more efficacious than taking the same dose of drug orally. Consequently, a higher oral dose of MTX was required for a comparable amelioration, which in turn increased its systemic toxicity.

Combinatorial agents are anticipated to offer an advanced strategy for efficient therapy. We prepared cilomilast-loaded oleic  (OA) nanocarriers to test the inhibitory capability against human neutrophil stimulation and a murine  model. OA played dual roles in the nanocarriers as both the active ingredient and lipid matrix in the nanoparticulate core. OA nanoparticles but not free OA could restrain calcium mobilization in activated neutrophils. The inhibition level of superoxide anion and elastase by cilomilast-loaded OA nanocarriers approximated that of free forms. In the mouse model, the intradermal nanosystems reduced imiquimod-induced epidermal thickening from 230.4 to 63.1 μm. Transepidermal water loss was decreased from 30.2 to 11.3 g/m/h by integrated nanocarriers. The nanosystems mitigated neutrophil infiltration and hyperproliferation in the psoriasiform lesion via decreased expression of cytokines and chemokines. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The long-term therapy for  is unsatisfactory due to the possible adverse effects and inefficiency after prolonged use. Both phosphodiesterase (PDE4) inhibitors and omega-9 fatty  such as oleic  (OA) show anti-inflammatory activity for treating inflamed skin diseases. Combinatorial agents are anticipated to offer an advanced strategy for efficient therapy. OA is also ideal for incorporation into nanoparticles to enhance particulate emulsification, drug entrapment, and biocompatibility.

Monoclonal antibodies are typically derived from a clonal expansion of antibody producing malignant human plasma cells. The initial monoclonal antibodies were created by fusing spleen cells from an immunized mouse with human or mouse myeloma cells (malignant self-perpetuating antibody producing cells), and selecting out and cloning the hybrid cells (hybridomas) that produced the desired antibody reactivity. These initial monoclonal products were mouse antibodies and were very valuable in laboratory and animal research and diagnostic assays, but were problematic as therapeutic agents because of immune reactions to the foreign mouse protein. Subsequently, production of chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibodies and means of further “humanizing” them and producing fully human recombinant monoclonal antibodies were developed. The conventions used in nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies indicate whether they are mouse (-omab), chimeric (-ximab), humanized (-zumab) or fully human (-umab). Monoclonal antibodies have broad clinical and experimental medical uses. Many of the initial monoclonal antibodies used in clinical medicine were immunomodulatory agents with activity against specific immune cells, such as CD4 or CD3 lymphocytes, which are important in the pathogenesis of rejection after solid organ transplantation. Subsequently, monoclonal antibodies were prepared against specific cytokines (anti-cytokines), which were believed to play a role in cell and tissue damage in immunologically mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, alkylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and , among others. In addition, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies were developed, aimed at blocking or inhibiting the activity of specific enzymes, cell surface transporters or signaling molecules and have been used in cancer chemotherapy and to treat severe viral infections. Use of monoclonal antibodies is currently broadening to therapy of other severe, nonmalignant conditions including asthma, atopic dermatitis, migraine headaches, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis and viral or bacterial infections. Thus, the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies do not fall into a single class and have broad therapeutic uses. As of 2018, more than 60 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are approved and in use in the United States. Monoclonal antibodies are generally well tolerated. Because they are large proteins (typically 150-200,000 daltons in size) they require parenteral, often intravenous, administration. Circulating proteins are metabolized by many cells, but particularly by hepatocytes. Proteins undergo hepatic uptake by endocytosis and are either degraded or recycled to the cell surface for secretion. The hepatic metabolism of antibodies often determines their half-life. Proteins are broken down by cellular proteases into small peptides and amino  that can used to synthesize other proteins. Metabolism of proteins does not generate toxic intermediates and, therefore, monoclonal antibodies are unlikely to induce drug induced liver injury via production of toxic metabolites. On the other hand, the peptides that are generated by the metabolism of the exogenously administered protein may ultimately be presented as foreign epitopes and generate an immune response. In addition, the primary effect of the monoclonal antibody may generate a response, either immune or otherwise, that leads to an immune mediate hepatic injury. Finally, monoclonal antibodies that suppress the immune system may cause reactivation of latent infections, including tuberculosis and hepatitis B.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31286971>Whole exome sequencing approach to childhood onset familial erythrodermic  unravels a novel mutation of CARD14 requiring unusual high doses of ustekinumab.</a></h1><p>Autosomal dominant gain of function mutations in caspase recruitment domain family member 14 (CARD14) is a rare condition associated with plaque-type , generalized pustular , palmoplantar pustular  and pityriasis rubra pilaris. Recently, a new CARD14 -associated phenotype defined as CAPE (CARD14-associated papulosquamous eruption) with clinical features of both  and pityriasis rubra pilaris was reported. We describe a family carrying a novel heterozygous mutation in CARD14 gene, with childhood-onset erythrodermic  requiring an unusual extremely high dose (up to 2 mg/kg every 8 weeks) of ustekinumab to achieve disease remission.We describe a large family with three pairs of twins presenting a clinical phenotype characterized by childhood-onset erythrodermic ; in some family members is also reported psoriatic arthritis. The two probands presented poor clinical response to topic and systemic therapy with antihistamine, steroid, retinoids, cyclosporine and etanercept. After exclusion of the most common genes associated to autoinflammatory diseases (IL36RN, IL1RN, MVK, TNFRSF1A, NLRP3, NLRP12, MEFV, NOD2, PSMB8, PSTPIP1, LPIN2) we approached a new gene search by subjecting to Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) analysis five members of the family. A novel heterozygous mutation (c.446 T > G, leading to the missense amino  substitution p.L149R) in the exon 4 of the CARD14 gene was identified in all affected members. Increasing dosages (up to 2 mg/kg every 8 weeks) of ustekinumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-23 (IL-23), allowed the complete control of the clinical manifestations, with an evident reduction of circulating Th17 and Th22 CD4+ T cell subsets.We describe the association of mutations of the CARD14 gene with an erythrodermic  pedigree, underlying the necessity to investigate CARD14 mutations in childhood-onset  cases and confirming the presence of CARD14 causative mutations also in erythrodermic  form, as recently reported.

Eicosanoids are released close to the source of inflammation, where they elicit local pleiotropic effects and dysregulations. Monitoring inflammatory mediators directly in skin lesions could provide new insights and therapeutic possibilities. Here, we analyzed dermal interstitial fluid samples obtained by dermal open-flow microperfusion in a rat model of skin inflammation. We developed a solid-phase extraction ultra-HPLC/MS/MS method to reliably and precisely analyze small-volume samples and quantified 11 eicosanoids [thromboxane B, prostaglandin (PG) E, PGD, PGF, leukotriene B, 15-HETE, 12-HETE, 5-HETE, 12-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic , 13-HODE, and 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic ]. Our method achieved a median intraday precision of approximately 5% and interday precision of approximately 8%. All calibration curves showed excellent linearity between 0.01 and 50 ng/ml ( > 0.980). In the rat model, eicosanoids were significantly increased in imiquimod-treated inflamed skin sites compared with untreated control sites. Oral treatment with an anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid decreased eicosanoid concentrations. These results show that a combination of tissue-specific sampling with LC/MS analytics is well suited for analyzing small sample volumes from minimally invasive sampling methods such as open-flow microperfusion or microdialysis to study local inflammation and the effect of treatments in skin diseases.Copyright © 2019 Pipper et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30154797>The Immunometabolomic Interface Receptor Hydroxycarboxylic  Receptor 2 Mediates the Therapeutic Effects of Dimethyl Fumarate in Autoantibody-Induced Skin Inflammation.</a></h1><p>The drug dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is in clinical use for the treatment of  and multiple sclerosis. In addition, it has recently been demonstrated to ameliorate skin pathology in mouse models of pemphigoid diseases, a group of autoimmune blistering diseases of the skin and mucous membranes. However, the mode of action of DMF in inflammatory skin diseases has remained elusive. Therefore, we have investigated here the mechanisms by which DMF improves skin pathology, using the antibody transfer model of bullous pemphigoid-like epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA). Experimental EBA was induced by transfer of antibodies against collagen VII that triggered the infiltration of immune cells into the skin and led to inflammatory skin lesions. DMF treatment reduced the infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes into the skin explaining the improved disease outcome in DMF-treated animals. Upon ingestion, DMF is converted to monomethyl fumarate that activates the hydroxycarboxylic  receptor 2 (HCA). Interestingly, neutrophils and monocytes expressed . To investigate whether the therapeutic effect of DMF in EBA is mediated by HCA, we administered oral DMF to -deficient mice () and wild-type littermates () and induced EBA. DMF treatment ameliorated skin lesions in  but not in  animals. These findings demonstrate that HCA is a molecular target of DMF treatment in EBA and suggest that HCA activation limits skin pathology by inhibiting the infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes into the skin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31235749>Small Molecule IL-36γ Antagonist as a Novel Therapeutic Approach for Plaque .</a></h1><p>IL-36 cytokines are pro-inflammatory members of the IL-1 family that are upregulated in inflammatory disorders. Specifically, IL-36γ is highly expressed in active psoriatic lesions and can drive pro-inflammatory processes in 3D human skin equivalents supporting a role for this target in skin inflammation. Small molecule antagonists of interleukins have been historically challenging to generate. Nevertheless, we performed a small molecule high-throughput screen to identify IL-36 antagonists using a novel TR-FRET binding assay. Several compounds, including 2-oxypyrimidine containing structural analogs of the marketed endothelin receptor A antagonist Ambrisentan, were identified as hits from the screen. A-552 was identified as a the most potent antagonist of human IL-36γ, but not the closely related family member IL-36α, was capable of attenuating IL-36γ induced responses in mouse and human disease models. Additionally, x-ray crystallography studies identified key amino  residues in the binding pocket present in human IL-36γ that are absent in human IL-36α. A-552 represents a first-in-class small molecule antagonist of IL-36 signaling that could be used as a chemical tool to further investigate the role of this pathway in inflammatory skin diseases such as .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574673>DDX58 and Classic Singleton-Merten Syndrome.</a></h1><p>Singleton-Merten syndrome manifests as dental dysplasia, glaucoma, , aortic calcification, and skeletal abnormalities including tendon rupture and arthropathy. Pathogenic variants in IFIH1 have previously been associated with the classic Singleton-Merten syndrome, while variants in DDX58 has been described in association with a milder phenotype, which is suggested to have a better prognosis. We studied a family with severe, "classic" Singleton-Merten syndrome.We undertook clinical phenotyping, next-generation sequencing, and functional studies of type I interferon production in patient whole blood and assessed the type I interferon promoter activity in HEK293 cells transfected with wild-type or mutant DDX58 stimulated with Poly I:C.We demonstrate a DDX58 autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutation, with constitutive upregulation of type I interferon.DDX58 mutations may be associated with the classic features of Singleton-Merten syndrome including dental dysplasia, tendon rupture, and severe cardiac sequela.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30758335>Pityriasis amiantacea following bone marrow transplant.</a></h1><p>Pityriasis amiantacea (PA) is a hair disorder characterized by matting of multiple hair shafts, typically occurring as an idiopathic condition.

One problem of using US molecular imaging is microbubbles challenges, including instability, short circulation time, and poor loading capacity and penetrability. It is urgent to design new acoustic contrast agents and new imaging methods to facilitate tumor-targeted imaging. In this study, phase-shift poly lactic-co-glycolic  (PLGA) nanoparticles modified with folate as an efficient US molecular probe were designed and the long-term targeted imaging was achieved by low-intensity focused US (LIFU) irradiation.A new 5-step method and purification procedure was carried out to obtain uniform folic  polyethylene glycol PLGA (PLGA-PEG-FA), the structure of which was confirmed by H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and thin-layer chromatography. Perflenapent (PFP) was wrapped in PLGA-PEG-FA by a double emulsion solvent evaporation method to obtain PFP/PLGA-PEG-FA nanoparticles. The targeted ability of the resulting nanoparticles was tested in vivo and in vitro. LIFU irradiation can irritate nanoparticle phase-shift to enhance tumor imaging both in vivo and in vitro.PLGA-PEG-FA was a light yellow powder with a final purity of at least 98%, the structure of which was confirmed by H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and thin-layer chromatography. Highly dispersed PFP/PLGA-PEG-FA nanoparticles with spherical morphology have an average diameter of 280.9±33.5 nm, PFP load efficiency of 59.4%±7.1%, and shells, thickness of 28±8.63 nm. The nanoparticles can specifically bind to cells expressing high folate receptor both in vivo and in vitro. Ultrasonic imaging was significantly enhanced in vitro and in vivo by LIFU irradiation. The retention time was significantly prolonged in vivo.Phase-shift PFP/PLGA-PEG-FA nanoparticles induced by LIFU can significantly enhance ultrasonic imaging, specifically targeting tumors expressing folate receptor. As a potential targeting acoustic molecular probe, PFP/PLGA-PEG-FA nanoparticles can be used to achieve targeted localization imaging.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29859222>Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic  inhibits the secretion of cytokines by dendritic cells via the TLR7/8 pathway in an imiquimod-induced  mouse model and in vitro.</a></h1><p> vulgaris is mediated by T and dendritic cells. This study aimed to investigate the effects of acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic  (AKBA) on activated dendritic cells (DCs) using an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced -like mouse model and murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) stimulated with resiquimod (R848) in vitro.The mice were treated with IMQ and intragastrically administered 25-100 mg/kg/day of AKBA, 1 mg/kg/day of methotrexate (MTX), or normal saline. The inflammation of skin lesions in IMQ mice were evaluated by  area and severity index (PASI) and pathological staining. The related proteins of Toll-like receptor (TLR)7/8 pathways were assessed using Western blotting, and the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-12p40 mRNA using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The numbers of DCs and marker-positive BMDCs were assessed using flow cytometry and the levels of inflammatory factors using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.AKBA and MTX obviously improved the -like skin lesions of IMQ-treated mice. AKBA also obviously decreased the PASI score, reduced the thickness of epidermis, ameliorated the infiltration of CD3+ and CD11c+ cells in skin lesions, decreased the activation of local DCs, inhibited the mRNA expression and secretion of inflammatory factors IL-12 and IL-23, inhibited the maturation and differentiation of DCs to promote T-cell differentiation, and inhibited the activation of TLR7/8 and IRF signaling pathways.This study implied that AKBA might have an anti-inflammatory effect on  by inhibiting the maturation and activation of DCs via the TLR8 and IRF signaling pathways.Copyright © 2018.

An impaired stratum corneum barrier function is a hallmark of AD, and it is associated with a reduction in ceramides with long-chain fatty  (FAs) in the stratum corneum. FA elongases, ELOVL1 and ELOVL4, are essential for the synthesis of these ceramides, together with ceramide synthase 3 (CerS3). We have previously shown that IFN-, but not other cytokines, induced the downregulation of these enzymes in cultured keratinocytes. Our aim was to investigate the  role of IFN- in the lesional skin of AD by analyzing mouse dermatitis models. The local mRNA expression of IFN- increased in mite fecal antigen-induced AD-like dermatitis in NC/Nga mice but not in imiquimod-induced -like dermatitis in BALB/c mice. The mRNA expression of ELOVL1 and ELOVL4 significantly decreased in AD-like dermatitis, whereas ELOVL1 increased in -like dermatitis. The expression of CerS3 increased slightly in AD-like dermatitis, but it increased by 4.6-fold in -like dermatitis. Consistently, the relative amount of ceramides with long-chain FAs decreased in AD-like dermatitis but not in -like dermatitis. These results suggest that IFN- in the lesional skin may reduce ceramides with long-chain FAs by decreasing the expression of ELOVL. Thus, IFN- may contribute to the chronicity of AD by impairing barrier function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30410900>Clinical and Videodermoscopic Evaluation of the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of a Shampoo Containing Ichthyol, Zanthalene, Mandelic , and Honey in the Treatment of Scalp .</a></h1><p>The aim of the present prospective multicenter open study was to clinically and instrumentally evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a shampoo, Mellis Cap® shampoo, containing ichthyol, zanthalene, mandelic , and honeydew honey in the treatment of mild to moderate scalp .Thirty subjects with mild to moderate  applied the shampoo three times a week for 12 weeks.

Dysregulated Th17 immune responses have been associated with the pathogenesis of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as , psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. In this article, we describe the  pharmacology of a potent and selective low molecular weight RORγt inhibitor identified after a structure-based hit-to-lead optimization effort. The compound interfered with co-activator binding to the RORγt ligand binding domain and impaired the transcriptional activity of RORγt as evidenced by blocked IL-17A secretion and RORE-mediated transactivation of a luciferase reporter gene. The inhibitor effectively reduced IL-17A production by human naive and memory T-cells and attenuated transcription of pro-inflammatory Th17 signature genes, such as , and . The compound selectively suppressed the Th17/IL-17 pathway and did not interfere with polarization of other T helper cell lineages. Furthermore, the inhibitor was selective for RORγt and did not modify the transcriptional activity of the closely related family members RORα and RORβ. Using human keratinocytes cultured with supernatants from compound treated Th17 cells we showed that pharmacological inhibition of RORγt translated to suppressed IL-17-regulated gene expression in keratinocyte cell cultures. Furthermore, in  immersion skin cultures our RORγt inhibitor suppressed IL-17A production by Th17-skewed skin resident cells which correlated with reduced human β defensin 2 expression in the skin. Our data suggests that inhibiting RORγt transcriptional activity by a low molecular weight inhibitor may hold utility for the treatment of Th17/IL-17-mediated skin pathologies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30110920>Evening Primrose () Biological Activity Dependent on Chemical Composition.</a></h1><p>Evening primrose ( L.) is a plant belonging to the family Onagraceae, in which the most numerous species is . Some plants belonging to the genus  L. are characterized by biological activity. Therefore, studies were conducted to determine the dependence of biological activity on the chemical composition of various parts of the evening primrose, mainly leaves, stems, and seeds. Common components of all parts of the  plants are fatty , phenolic , and flavonoids. In contrast, primrose seeds also contain proteins, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins. Therefore, it is believed that the most interesting sources of biologically active compounds are the seeds and, above all, evening primrose seed oil. This oil contains mainly aliphatic alcohols, fatty , sterols, and polyphenols. Evening primrose oil (EPO) is extremely high in linoleic  (LA) (70⁻74%) and γ-linolenic  (GLA) (8⁻10%), which may contribute to the proper functioning of human tissues because they are precursors of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. EPO supplementation results in an increase in plasma levels of γ-linolenic  and its metabolite dihomo-γ-linolenic  (DGLA). This compound is oxidized by lipoxygenase (15-LOX) to 15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic  (15-HETrE) or, under the influence of cyclooxygenase (COX), DGLA is metabolized to series 1 prostaglandins. These compounds have anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties. Furthermore, 15-HETrE blocks the conversion of arachidonic  (AA) to leukotriene A₄ (LTA₄) by direct inhibition of 5-LOX. In addition, γ-linolenic  suppresses inflammation mediators such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and cytokine - tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). The beneficial effects of EPO have been demonstrated in the case of atopic dermatitis, , Sjögren's syndrome, asthma, and anti-cancer therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29695409>Soy Phosphatidylglycerol Reduces Inflammation in a Contact Irritant Ear Edema Mouse Model In Vivo.</a></h1><p>We have previously shown that phosphatidylglycerol (PG) regulates the function of keratinocytes, the predominant cells that compose the epidermis, inhibiting the proliferation of rapidly dividing keratinocytes. In particular, soy PG, a PG mixture with a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty , is efficacious at inhibiting these proliferating keratinocytes.  is a skin disorder characterized by hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and inflammation. Data in the lung suggest that PG in pulmonary surfactant inhibits inflammation. To investigate the possibility of using PG containing polyunsaturated fatty  for the treatment of , we examined the effect of soy PG on inflammation induced by the application of 12--tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), a contact irritant, to mouse ears in vivo. We monitored ear thickness and weight as a measure of ear edema, as well as CD45-positive immune cell infiltration. Our results indicate that soy PG when applied together with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (vitamin D), an agent known to acutely disrupt the skin barrier, suppressed ear edema and inhibited the infiltration of CD45-positive immune cells. On the other hand, neither PG nor vitamin D alone was effective. The combination also decreased tumor necrosis factor- (TNF) levels. This result suggested the possibility that PG was not permeating the skin barrier efficiently. Therefore, in a further study we applied PG in a penetration-enhancing vehicle and found that it inhibited inflammation induced by the phorbol ester and decreased CD45-positive immune cell infiltration.

Additionally, WD intake substantially increased the incidence of dermatitis. Cutaneous antimicrobial peptide genesS100A8, S100A9, and Defb4 were reduced in WD-fed mice, but increased when mice developed skin lesions. In addition, Tgr5 and TGR5-regulated Dio2 and Nos3 were reduced in WD intake but induced in dermatitic lesions. Trpa1 and Trpv1, which mediate itch, were also increased in dermatitic lesions. The expression of S1pr2 and genes encoding sphingosine kinases, S1P phosphatases, binding protein, and transporter were all reduced by WD intake but elevated in dermatitic lesions. Furthermore, dermatitis development increased total cutaneous BA with an altered profile, which may change TGR5 and S1PR2 activity. Moreover, supplementation with BA sequestrant cholestyramine reduced epidermal thickening as well as cutaneous inflammatory cytokines.In summary, activation of TGR5 and S1PR2, which regulate itch, keratinocyte proliferation, metabolism, and inflammation, may contribute to WD-exacerbated dermatitis with Th2 and Th17 features. In addition, elevated total BA play a significant role in inducing dermatitis and cutaneous inflammation.Copyright © 2019 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology. Published by Elsevier B.V.
