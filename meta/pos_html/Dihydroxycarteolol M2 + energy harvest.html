Restoring grasslands could contribute to a portion of this requirement through biomass  for bioenergy use. We investigated which plant community characteristics are associated with differences in biomass yield from a range of realistic native prairie plantings (n = 11; i.e., conservation planting, restoration, and wildlife cover). Our primary goal was to understand whether patterns in plant community composition and the Floristic Quality Index (FQI) were related to productivity as evidenced by dormant season biomass yield. FQI is an objective measure of how closely a plant community represents that of a pre-European settlement community. Our research was conducted in planted fields of native tallgrass prairie species, and provided a gradient in floristic quality index, species richness, species diversity, and species evenness in south-central Wisconsin during 2008 and 2009. We used a network of 15 randomly located 1  plots within each field to characterize the plant community and estimate biomass yield by clipping the plots at the end of each growing season. While plant community composition and diversity varied significantly by planting type, biomass yield did not vary significantly among planting types (ANOVA; P >0.05). Biomass yield was positively correlated with plant community evenness, richness, C4 grass cover, and floristic quality index, but negatively correlated with plant species diversity in our multi-season multiple linear mixed effects models. Concordantly, plots with biomass yield in the lowest quartile (biomass yield < 3500 kh/ha) had 8% lower plant community evenness and 9% lower FQI scores than those in the upper quartile (biomass yield > 5800 kh/ha). Our results suggest that promoting the establishment of fields with high species evenness and floristic quality may increase biomass yield, while simultaneously supporting biodiversity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16995625>Movement of foraging Tundra Swans explained by spatial pattern in cryptic food densities.</a></h2><p>We tested whether Tundra Swans use information on the spatial distribution of cryptic food items (below ground Sago pondweed tubers) to shape their movement paths. In a continuous environment, swans create their own food patches by digging craters, which they exploit in several feeding bouts. Series of short (<1 m) intra-patch movements alternate with longer inter-patch movements (>1 m). Tuber biomass densities showed a positive spatial auto-correlation at a short distance (<3 m), but not at a larger distance (3-8 m). Based on the spatial pattern of the food distribution (which is assumed to be pre- information for the swan) and the  costs and benefits for different food densities at various distances, we calculated the optimal length of an inter-patch movement. A swan that moves to the patch with the highest gain rate was predicted to move to the adjacent patch (at 1 m) if the food density in the current patch had been high (>25 g/) and to a more distant patch (at 7-8 m) if the food density in the current patch had been low (<25 g/). This prediction was tested by measuring the response of swans to manipulated tuber densities. In accordance with our predictions, swans moved a long distance (>3 m) from a low-density patch and a short distance (<3 m) from a high-density patch. The quantitative agreement between prediction and observation was greater for swans feeding in pairs than for solitary swans. The result of this movement strategy is that swans visit high-density patches at a higher frequency than on offer and, consequently, achieve a 38% higher long-term gain rate. Swans also take advantage of spatial variance in food abundance by regulating the time in patches, staying longer and consuming more food from rich than from poor patches. We can conclude that the shape of the foraging path is a reflection of the spatial pattern in the distribution of tuber densities and can be understood from an optimal foraging perspective.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17418920>Fate of HTO following its acute soil deposition at different growth stages of Chinese cabbage.</a></h2><p>Lysimeter experiments were carried out in a greenhouse to study the fate of HTO following its soil deposition at different growth stages of Chinese cabbage. An HTO solution was applied to the surface of an acidic sandy soil at a time before, and four different times after, sowing. The transfer of HTO to the plants was quantified with the areal transfer factor (TFa,  kg(-1)-fresh) defined as the ratio of the plant concentration at  to the areal activity deposition. In the four post-sowing applications, the TFa values were in the ranges of 1.6 x 10(-5)-4.9 x 10(-3) for TFWT and 4.5 x 10(-6) -4.3 x 10(-5) for OBT, increasing with a decrease in the time interval between application and . In the pre-sowing application, which was followed by a soil mixing, the TFa values for TFWT and OBT were 1.3 x 10(-4) and 8.6 x 10(-6), respectively. One week after , soil samplings were made for the applications at 26 (A(26)) and 63d (A(63)) after sowing. Peaks of the depth profiles of the soil HTO appeared in the 10-15 cm layer for A(26) and the 5-10 cm layer for A(63). The top 30 cm of soil contained 0.5% and 20% of the applied activity for A(26) and A(63), respectively. Negligible fractions seemed to be in the deeper zone. It was estimated that almost all or most of the applied HTO had escaped to the air before plants' .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11539685>Utilization of potatoes for life support systems in space: III.  Productivity at successive  dates under 12-h and 24-h photoperiods.</a></h2><p>Potatoes are among several crops under consideration for use in controlled ecological life support systems (CELSS) being proposed for space colonies. Efficient crop production for such life support systems will require near-optimal growing conditions with harvests taken when production per unit area per unit time is maximum. To determine this maximum for potato, cv. Norland plants were grown in walk-in growth rooms under 12-h and 24-h photoperiods at 16 C and harvested at 42, 63, 84, 105, 126 and 148 days from planting. At 42 days, plants were encaged in wire fence cylinders with a cross-sectional area of 0.2 . The dry weights (dwt) of tubers and of the entire plants increased under both photoperiods until the final  date (148 days), reaching 572 g tuber dwt and 704 g total dwt under 12-h, and 791 g tuber dwt and 972 g total dwt under 24-h. At a spacing of 0.2  per plant, the 148-day tuber production from plants under continuous light would equate to nearly 40 t ha-1 dry matter (200 t fresh weight), approximately twice that of exceptionally high field yields. Tuber productivity (g m-2 day-1) under the 24-h photoperiod reached a maximum of 29.4 g dwt m-2 day-1 at 126 days, but continued to rise throughout the experiment under the 12-h photoperiod, reaching 19.5 g dwt m-2 day-1 at 14 days, approximately 25  would continuously provide the daily dietary  requirements for one human.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11537261>Wheat production in controlled environments.</a></h2><p>Our goal is to optimize conditions for maximum yield and quality of wheat to be used in a controlled-environment, life-support system (CELSS) in a Lunar or Martian base or perhaps in a space craft. With yields of 23 to 57 g m-2 d-1 of edible biomass, a minimum size for a CELSS would be between 12 and 30  per person, utilizing about 600 W m-2 of electrical  for artificial light. Temperature, irradiance, photoperiod, carbon-dioxide levels, humidity, and wind velocity are controlled in state-of-the-art growth chambers. Nutrient solutions (adjusted for wheat) are supplied to the roots via a recirculating system that controls pH by adding HNO3 and controlling the NO3/NH4 ratio in solution. A rock-wool plant support allows direct seeding and densities up to 10,000 plants per meter2. Densities up to 2000 plants m-2 appear to increase seed yield. Biomass production increases almost linearly with increasing irradiance from 400 to 1700 micromoles m-2 s-1 of photosynthetic photon flux (PPF), but the efficiency of light utilization decreases over this range. Photoperiod and temperature both have a profound influence on floral initiation, spikelet formation, stem elongation, and fertilization. High temperatures (25 to 27 degrees C) and long days shorten the life cycle and promote rapid growth, but cooler temperatures (20 degrees C) and shorter days greatly increase seed number per head and thus yield (g m-2). The life cycle is lengthened in these conditions but yield per day (g m-2 d-1) is still increased. We have evaluated about 600 cultivars from around the world and have developed several breeding lines for our controlled conditions. Some of our ultra-dwarf lines (30 to 50 cm tall) look especially promising with high yields and high  indices (percent edible biomass).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8557019>Seasonal variations in  balance among agriculturalists in central Mali: compromise or adaptation?</a></h2><p>This paper considers whether seasonal variations in the  balance of adult agriculturalists in Central Mali exceed acceptable risk, or whether they represent a short-term adaptive response without functional consequence.Prospective/longitudinal study design.Agricultural village in rural Mali.From a total population of 166 adults aged > or = 16 years, two cohorts of 63 men and 73 non-pregnant women with complete records were retained for analysis.Over a 12-month period, monthly anthropometry and biweekly retrospective assessments of morbidity were made on every adult in the sample. Direct measures of household food consumption were collected twice in , dry and rainy seasons respectively. Continuous 15-h observations of time-use and work intensity were conducted on a sub-sample of active adults and used to calculate mean seasonal  expenditure. balance as measured by body mass index (BMI; kg/) declines significantly in the rainy season (P < 0.01), corresponding to a seasonal weight loss of 2-3 kg. A similar seasonal trend in % body fat (P < 0.0001) suggests that most of this loss represents adipose tissue. A rainy season increase in arm muscle area (AMA) implies that there is no seasonal compromise in lean tissue. Among men and women with BMI > 18.5, seasonal fat loss is significantly greater than their leaner counterparts. Considering the likely determinants of variations in  balance, an increase in the duration and incidence of adult morbidity is observed; however, no significant intercorrelations exist between it and seasonal nutritional indices. Comparing trends in  expenditure and intake, a disturbance in  homeostasis is apparent as  expenditure increases in the rainy season relative to constant household food consumption across seasons. While seasonal variations in  expenditure are not as dramatic in the female sample, they appear to have less opportunity to recover from so-called 'heavy' levels of expenditure experienced in successive dry and rainy seasons. Periods of 'light' activity in both  and dry seasons provide the male sample with a reasonable length of time in which to reconstitute  stores after the physical demands of the rainy season.In the year of study, the modest loss of body fat recorded in the rainy season (< 5% body mass) represents a successful physiological response to  imbalance, and is unlikely to compromise adult productive and reproductive function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12854801>Performance of finishing pigs in hoop structures and confinement during winter and summer.</a></h2><p>Performance of finishing pigs in hoop structures or confinement during winter and summer was evaluated in Iowa. Hoops are large, tent-like shelters with cornstalks or straw for bedding. During summer and winter seasons for 3 yr (1998 to 2001), six trials were conducted using three hoop barns (designed for 150 pigs per pen, one pen per hoop) or a mechanically ventilated confinement barn with slatted floors (designed for 22 pigs per pen, six pens in the barn). A total of 3,518 pigs started the trials. Summer trials were June through October, and winter trials were December through April. Target stocking density was 1.11 /pig in hoops and 0.74 /pig in confinement. Identical corn-based diets were fed ad libitum from 16 to 118 kg for 127 d. Pigs were scanned before  for backfat and loin muscle area. When seasons were merged (season x housing interaction, P > or = 0.05), hoop-fed pigs had more backfat (21.8 +/- 0.3 vs 20.8 +/- 0.2 mm; P < 0.001), smaller loin muscle area (41.3 +/- 0.3 vs 43.0 +/- 0.2 cm2; P < 0.001), less lean percentage (51.1 +/- 0.2 vs 52.1 +/- 0.1%; P < 0.001), and less yield (74.9 vs 75.8 +/- 0.1%; P < 0.001) than confinement-fed pigs. When season x housing type interactions were observed (P < 0.004), summer hoop-fed pigs had greater ADG (834 +/- 5 vs 802 +/- 3 g/d; P < 0.001), required fewer days to 113 kg (174.9 +/- 0.9 vs 178.5 +/- 0.6 d; P < 0.01), had similar ADFI (2.40 +/- 0.03 vs 2.35 +/- 0.02 kg/d, as-fed basis) and gain:feed (G:F; 348 +/- 4 vs 342 +/- 3 g/kg) compared with confinement-fed pigs. Lean gain/day and efficiency of lean gain did not differ between housing systems. During winter, hoop-fed pigs had similar ADG (794 +/- 5 vs 801 +/- 3 g/ d), required more days to 113 kg (176.7 +/- 0.9 vs 172.9 +/- 0.6 d; P < 0.01), had greater ADFI (2.54 +/- 0.03 vs 2.35 +/- 0.02; P < 0.001), less G:F (313 +/- 4 vs 341 +/- 3; P < 0.001), less lean gain/day (312 +/- 2 vs 322 +/- 1 g/d; P < 0.01), and less efficiency of lean gain (130 +/- 2 vs 144 +/- 1 g lean gain/kg feed; P < 0.01) than confinement-fed pigs. Percentage of mortalities and culls did not differ between housing systems. During summer, there was a trend for fewer light pigs at marketing (< 100 kg) from hoops (0.8 vs 1.7%; P = 0.10). During winter, there were more light pigs at marketing from hoops (3.9 vs 1.3%; P = 0.01) than from confinement. Bedding use in hoops was 92 and 122 kg/pig for summer and winter, respectively. Performance of finishing pigs in bedded hoop structures depends in part on thermal environment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27720147>Adipose tissue remodeling in late-lactation dairy cows during feed-restriction-induced negative  balance.</a></h2><p>Excessive rates of demand lipolysis in the adipose tissue (AT) during periods of negative  balance (NEB) are associated with increased susceptibility to disease and limited lactation performance. Lipolysis induces a remodeling process within AT that is characterized by an inflammatory response, cellular proliferation, and changes in the extracellular matrix (ECMT). The adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) is a key component of the inflammatory response. Infiltration of ATM-forming cellular aggregates was demonstrated in transition cows, suggesting that ATM trafficking and phenotype changes may be associated with disease. However, it is currently unknown if ATM infiltration occurs in dairy cows only during NEB states related to the transition period or also during NEB-induced lipolysis at other stages of lactation. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in ATM trafficking and inflammatory phenotypes, and the expression of genetic markers of AT remodeling in healthy late-lactation cows during feed restriction-induced NEB. After a 14-d (d -14 to d -1) preliminary period, Holstein cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 feeding protocols, ad libitum (AL) or feed restriction (FR), for 4 d (d 1-4). Caloric intake was reduced in FR to achieve a targeted  balance of -15 Mcal/d of net  for lactation. Omental and subcutaneous AT samples were collected laparoscopically to  stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells on d -3 and 4. The FR induced a NEB of -14.1±0.62 Mcal/d of net  for lactation, whereas AL cows remained in positive  balance (3.2±0.66 Mcal/d of NE). The FR triggered a lipolytic response reflected in increased plasma nonesterified fatty acids (0.65±0.05 mEq/L on d 4), enhanced phosphorylation of hormone sensitive lipase, and reduced adipocyte diameter. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that on d 4, FR cows had increased numbers of CD172a, an ATM (M1 and ) surface marker, cells in SVF that were localized in aggregates. However, FR did not alter the number of SVF cells expressing M1 markers (CD14 and CD11c) or  markers (CD11b and CD163). This finding contrasts with the predominately M1 phenotype observed previously in ATM from clinically diseased cows. No changes were observed in the expression of ECMT-related or cell proliferation markers. In summary, an acute 4-d lipolytic stimulus in late-lactation dairy cows led to ATM infiltration with minimal changes in inflammatory phenotype and no changes in ECMT. These results underscore that physiological changes related to parturition, the onset of lactation, extended periods of lipolysis, or a combination of these can induce intense AT remodeling with enhanced ATM inflammatory phenotype expression that may impair the metabolic function of AT in transition dairy cattle.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

However, it is costly to  microalgae as it is commonly cultured in water and the cells are too small to . In order to reduce the cost of cultivation and harvesting, it is important to improve the biomass productivity of microalgae. Here, we utilized the attachment method to culture microalgae to cut off the cost of culture and .In this paper, various supporting surface with different hydrophility including polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polysulfone (PS), which are not easy to be degraded in the culture medium, were used for microalgae culture by the attachment method. The results showed that PVDF supporting cloth was suitable for the algae growth, and its average biomass productivity was to 4.0 g//day. Furthermore, a series of PVDF concentrations were tested, and cloth treated with 3% or 5% PVDF solution was better for the algae culture. In addition, Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) with different molecular weight was added to the PVDF solution as porogens to produce rough surface. And the addition of PVP resulted in better growth with 6.0 g//day of average biomass productivity.This attachment method makes the  of microalgae easy and -saving, because the microalgae grow on the supporting material and is easy to be scraped. The results indicate that the PVDF-treated cloth is a potential alternative for the microalgae attachment culture.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11539761>Utilization of potatoes for life support systems in space.  I.  Cultivar-photoperiod interactions.</a></h2><p>The productive potential of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L. cvs. Norland, Superior, Norchip, and Kennebec) was assessed for life support systems being proposed for space stations and/or lunar colonies. Plants were grown in walk-in-growth rooms for 15 weeks at 20 C under 12-, 16- and 20-h photoperiods of 400 micromoles m-2 s-1 photosynthetic photon flux (PPF). Norland yielded the greatest tuber fresh weight, producing 2.3, 2.4, and 2.9 kg/plant under 12-, 16-, and 20-h photoperiods, respectively. The respective yields for the other cultivars under 12-, 16-, and 20-h were: Superior, 1.9, 1.5, and 1.8 kg/plant; Norchip, 1.8, 1.4, and 2.0 kg/plant; and Kennebec, 2.3, 0.2, 0.8 kg/plant. Shoot and total plant biomass increased with lengthening photoperiods except for Kennebec, which showed increased shoot growth but no change in total growth with the longer photoperiods. Kennebec shoot growth under the 20-h photoperiod, and to some extent under 16-h, was noticeably stunted with shortened internodes. In addition, leaves of these plants showed mild chlorosis with rusty "flecking" of the surfaces. The  index (ratio of tuber yield/total biomass) was highest for all cultivars under the 12-h photoperiod, with a maximum of 0.69 for Norland. Similarly, the tuber yield per input of irradiant  also was highest under 12-h for all cultivars. The tuber yield expressed on an area basis for the highest yielding treatment (Norland under 20-h) equaled 2.2 kg dry matter m-2. Over 15 week this equates to a productivity of 20.7 g tuber dry matter m-2 day-1. Assuming 3.73 kcal per g tuber dry matter and a daily human dietary requirement of 2800 kcal, then 36  of potatoes could supply the daily  requirement for one human. Potential for increasing productivity is discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11537758>Plant productivity in controlled environments.</a></h2><p>To assess the cost and area/volume requirements of a farm in a space station or Lunar or Martian base, a few laboratories in the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and Japan are studying optimum controlled environments for the production of selected crops. Temperature, light, photoperiod, CO2, humidity, the root-zone environment, and cultivars are the primary factors being manipulated to increase yields and  index. Our best wheat yields on a time basis (24 g m-2 day-1 of edible biomass) are five times good field yields and twice the world record. Similar yields have been obtained in other laboratories with potatoes and lettuce; soybeans are also promising. These figures suggest that approximately 30  under continuous production could support an astronaut with sufficient protein and about 2800 kcal day-1. Scientists under Iosif Gitelzon in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, have lived in a closed system for up to 5 months, producing 80% of their own food. Thirty square meters for crops were allotted to each of the two men taking part in the experiment. A functional controlled-environment life-support system (CELSS) will require the refined application of several disciplines: controlled-environment agriculture, food preparation, waste disposal, and control-systems technology, to list only the broadest categories. It has seemed intuitively evident that ways could be found to prepare food, regenerate plant nutrients from wastes, and even control and integrate several subsystems of a CELSS. But could sufficient food be produced in the limited areas and with the limited  that might be available? Clearly, detailed studies of food production were necessary.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11352010>Harvesting  from the marine sediment--water interface.</a></h2><p>Pairs of platinum mesh or graphite fiber-based electrodes, one embedded in marine sediment (anode), the other in proximal seawater (cathode), have been used to  low-level power from natural, microbe established, voltage gradients at marine sediment-seawater interfaces in laboratory aquaria. The sustained power harvested thus far has been on the order of 0.01 W/ of electrode geometric area but is dependent on electrode design, sediment composition, and temperature. It is proposed that the sediment/anode-seawater/cathode configuration constitutes a microbial fuel cell in which power results from the net oxidation of sediment organic matter by dissolved seawater oxygen. Considering typical sediment organic carbon contents, typical fluxes of additional reduced carbon by sedimentation to sea floors < 1,000 m deep, and the proven viability of dissolved seawater oxygen as an oxidant for power generation by seawater batteries, it is calculated that optimized power supplies based on the phenomenon demonstrated here could power oceanographic instruments deployed for routine long-term monitoring operations in the coastal ocean.</p></html>
