We hypothesized that unsaturated FA could alleviate saturated FA-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurring in intestinal secretory goblet cells, and consequently the reduced synthesis and secretion of mucins that form the protective mucus . To investigate this hypothesis, we treated well-differentiated human colonic LS174T goblet cells with palmitic acid (PAL)-the most commonly used inducer of lipotoxicity in in vitro systems-or -9, -6, or -3 unsaturated fatty acids alone or in co-treatment with PAL, and measured the impact of such treatments on ER stress and Muc2 production. Our results showed that only eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids protect goblet cells against ER stress-mediated altered Muc2 secretion induced by PAL, whereas neither linolenic acid nor -9 and -6 FA are able to provide such protection. We conclude that EPA and DHA could represent potential therapeutic nutrients against the detrimental lipotoxicity of saturated fatty acids, associated with type  diabetes and obesity or inflammatory bowel disease. These in vitro data remain to be explored in vivo in a context of dietary obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31010378>Doxorubicin-induced neurotoxicity is associated with acute alterations in synaptic plasticity, apoptosis, and lipid peroxidation.</a></h2><p>Cognitive deficits are commonly reported by patients following treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. Anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens are associated with cognitive impairment and reductions in neuronal connectivity in cancer survivors, and doxorubicin (Dox) is a commonly used anthracycline. Although it has been reported that Dox distribution to the central nervous system (CNS) is limited, considerable Dox concentrations are observed in the brain with co-administration of certain medications. Additionally, pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are overproduced in cancer or in response to chemotherapy, can reduce the  of the blood-brain  (BBB). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the acute neurotoxic effects of Dox on hippocampal neurons. In this study, we utilized a hippocampal cell line (H19-7/IGF-IR) along with rodent hippocampal slices to evaluate the acute neurotoxic effects of Dox. Hippocampal slices were used to measure long-term potentiation (LTP), and expression of proteins was determined by immunoblotting. Cellular assays for mitochondrial complex activity and lipid peroxidation were also utilized. We observed reduction in LTP in hippocampal slices with Dox. In addition, lipid peroxidation was increased as measured by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content indicating oxidative stress. Caspase-3 expression was increased indicating an increased propensity for cell death. Finally, the phosphorylation of signaling molecules which modulate LTP including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/ (ERK1/), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Akt were increased. This data indicates that acute Dox exposure dose-dependently impairs synaptic processes associated with hippocampal neurotransmission, induces apoptosis, and increases lipid peroxidation leading to neurotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31405019>Cooked Red Lentils Dose-Dependently Modulate the Colonic Microenvironment in Healthy C57Bl/6 Male Mice.</a></h2><p>Dietary pulses, including lentils, are protein-rich plant foods that are enriched in intestinal health-promoting bioactives, such as non-digestible carbohydrates and phenolic compounds. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of diets supplemented with cooked red lentils on the colonic microenvironment (microbiota composition and activity and epithelial   and function). C57Bl/6 male mice were fed one of five diets: a control basal diet (BD), a BD-supplemented diet with 5, 10 or 20% cooked red lentils (by weight), or a BD-supplemented diet with 0.7% pectin (equivalent soluble fiber level as found in the 20% lentil diet). Red lentil supplementation resulted in increased: (1) fecal microbiota Î±-diversity; () abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria (e.g.,  and ); (3) concentrations of fecal SCFAs; (4) mRNA expression of SCFA receptors (G-protein-coupled receptors () and tight/adherens junction proteins (Zona Occulden-1 (), Claudin-, E-cadherin). Overall, 20% lentil had the greatest impact on colon health outcomes, which were in part explained by a change in the soluble and insoluble fiber profile of the diet. These results support recent public health recommendations to increase consumption of plant-based protein foods for improved health, in particular intestinal health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31356632>Internalin AB-expressing recombinant Lactobacillus casei protects Caco- cells from Listeria monocytogenes-induced damages under simulated intestinal conditions.</a></h2><p>Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular foodborne pathogen that employs a number of strategies to survive challenging gastrointestinal conditions. It proliferates in the gut and subsequently causes listeriosis in high-risk individuals. Therefore, inhibition of its adherence to the intestinal receptors is crucial in controlling its infection. In this study, the effect of our previously developed recombinant Lactobacillus casei strain expressing invasion protein, Internalin AB of L. monocytogenes (LbcInlAB) on epithelial infection processes of the latter under simulated intestinal conditions was investigated.The confluent Caco- cell monolayer was pre-exposed to different L. casei strains at a multiplicity of exposure (MOE) of 10 for various periods before infection with L. monocytogenes at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 under simulated intestinal conditions. Subsequently, L. monocytogenes adhesion, invasion, and translocation, cytotoxicity and impact on tight junction  of the Caco- cells were analyzed.Under the simulated gastrointestinal condition, LbcInlAB showed a significant increase (p<0.0001) in adherence to, invasion and translocation through the Caco- cells when compared with the wild type strain. Although LbcInlAB strain exhibited enhanced inhibition of L. monocytogenes, it was not able to displace L. monocytogenes cells already attached to the monolayer. Additionally, pre-exposure to LbcInlAB reduced L. monocytogenes-mediated cytotoxicity and protected the tight junction  function.The recombinant L. casei expressing InlAB shows potential for use as a prophylactic intervention strategy for targeted control of L. monocytogenes during the intestinal phase of infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31434575>Streptococcus agalactiae disrupts P-glycoprotein  in brain endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Bacterial meningitis is a serious life threatening infection of the CNS. To cause meningitis, blood-borne bacteria need to interact with and penetrate brain endothelial cells (BECs) that comprise the blood-brain . BECs help maintain brain homeostasis and they possess an array of efflux transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), that  to efflux potentially harmful compounds from the CNS back into the circulation. Oftentimes, efflux also serves to limit the brain uptake of therapeutic drugs, representing a major hurdle for CNS drug delivery. During meningitis, BEC  integrity is compromised; however, little is known about efflux transport perturbations during infection. Thus, understanding the impact of bacterial infection on P-gp  would be important for potential routes of therapeutic intervention. To this end, the meningeal bacterial pathogen, Streptococcus agalactiae, was found to inhibit P-gp activity in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived BECs, and live bacteria were required for the observed inhibition. This observation was correlated to decreased P-gp expression both in vitro and during infection in vivo using a mouse model of bacterial meningitis. Given the impact of bacterial interactions on P-gp , it will be important to incorporate these findings into analyses of drug delivery paradigms for bacterial infections of the CNS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351968>Berberine induces ZIP14 expression and modulates zinc redistribution to protect intestinal mucosal  during polymicrobial sepsis.</a></h2><p>The present study investigated if berberine might induce Zrt-Irt-like protein 14 (ZIP14) and affect zinc redistribution to protect intestinal  in sepsis.Rodent model of sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Plasma endotoxin was assayed by LAL test and plasma zinc was measured by flame atomic spectrophotometer. Gut mucosal permeability was determined by plasma FITC-dextran. Zinc content and ZIP14 mRNA in gut mucosa were assayed by spectrophotometer and qRT-PCR, respectively. Tight junction  of Caco- was evaluated by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Tight junction (TJ) protein expression was detected by Western blotting.Berberine and zinc gluconate pretreatment to CLP rats improved survival rate, reduced plasma endotoxin level, alleviated hypozincemia, increased zinc accumulation and ZIP14 mRNA expression in the intestinal mucosa. Berberine and zinc gluconate pretreatment decreased CLP-elicited intestinal hyperpermeability to FITC-dextran. These effects of berberine in vivo were abolished by AG1024. In vitro, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) repressed zinc transfer into Caco- cells exposed to zinc gluconate. Berberine and IGF-I treatment increased ZIP14 protein expression and promoted zinc transfer into Caco- cells exposed to zinc gluconate plus LPS. Berberine treatment induced TJ protein (claudin-1 and occludin) and raised TEER in LPS-treated Caco- cells. These effects of berberine in vitro were partially inhibited by ZIP14 siRNA.The present study reveals that berberine induces ZIP14 expression and affects zinc re- distribution to protect intestinal  in sepsis, which is partially linked with the activation of IGF-I signaling.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Limited treatment options for severe influenza pneumonia prioritize the need for the discovery of effective therapies. IL-22 is a cytokine that promotes tissue  and has strong promise as a treatment option. While research has been focused on the cytokine itself, there is limited understanding of the regulation of the IL-22 receptor (IL-22Ra1) at the epithelial surface during infection.IL-22Ra1 levels were measured by qRT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence following H1N1 influenza infection (A/PR/8/34 H1N1) or synthetic TLR3 mimetic, Poly (I:C). Regulation of the receptor was determined using STAT inhibitors (STAT1, STAT3 and PanSTAT inhibitors), TLR3 inhibition, and neutralization of interferon alpha receptor  (IFNAR2). Significance was determined by a p-value of greater than 0.05. Significance between two groups was measured using unpaired t-test and significance between more than two groups was measured using one-way ANOVA with Tukey Multiple Comparison Test.Here we show both in vivo and in vitro that IL-22Ra1 was induced as early as 24âh after influenza (H1N1 PR8) infection. This induction was triggered by toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as a TLR3 mimetic [Poly (I:C)] also induced IL-22Ra1 and inhibition of endosomal formation required for TLR3 function inhibited this process. This upregulation was dependent upon IFNÎ² signaling through STAT1. Importantly, induction of IL-22Ra1 significantly increased IL-22 signaling as evidenced by pSTAT3 levels following IL-22 treatment.Collectively, these data suggest epithelial cells may optimize the beneficial effects of IL-22 through the induction of the IL-22 receptor during viral infection in the lung.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31352050>Development of a novel human stratum corneum model, as a tool in the optimization of drug formulations.</a></h2><p>Transdermal delivery represents a very attractive administration route that provides various advantages over other methods of administration, including enhanced patient compliance via non-invasive, painless and simple application and reduced side effects. Thereby, the research on suitable drugs for this route continues to increase. However, most of drug candidates face the challenges of low drug permeability across the skin's biologically active  - the stratum corneum (SC). In this context, a low cost, simple screening tool to evaluate penetration of drug candidates in a human SC  model was developed. The in vitro model is based on a modified phospholipid vesicle-based permeation assay (PVPA) with a lipid composition close to human SC layer. The new SC PVPA model can be stored up to â¯weeks at -20â¯Â°C, withstand a pH range from .0 to 8.0 and the presence of co-solvents (DMSO, oleic acid and cremophorÂ®) without losing their . The human mimicking SC PVPA model was able to detect calcein permeability differences when different drugs, applied in the therapy of skin-related diseases, were present. The obtained data correlated well with the well accepted pig ear model, which highlights the potential of this new human SC model.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We postulated that diabetes and systemic angiotensin-converting enzyme  (ACE2) deficiency would synergize to adversely impact both the microbiome and gut  function.  Bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing and metatranscriptomic analysis were performed on fecal samples from WT, ACE2, Akita (type 1 diabetic, T1D), and ACE2-Akita mice. Gut   was assessed by immunofluorescence, and BM cell extravasation into the small intestine was evaluated by flow cytometry. In the CE2-Akita or Akita mice, the disrupted  was associated with reduced levels of myeloid angiogenic cells (MACs), but no increase in inflammatory monocytes was observed within the gut parenchyma. Genomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of the microbiome of ACE2-Akita mice demonstrated a marked increase in peptidoglycan (PGN) producing bacteria. When compared to control cohorts treated with saline, intraperitoneal administration of MACs significantly decreased the microbiome gene expression associated with PGN biosynthesis and restored epithelial and endothelial gut  . Also indicative of diabetic gut  dysfunction, increased levels of PGN and intestinal fatty acid binding protein- (FABP-) were observed in plasma of human subjects with T1D (n=21) and Type  diabetes (T2D, n=23) compared to non-diabetic controls (n=23). Using human retinal endothelial cells, we determined that PGN activates a non-canonical Toll-like receptor- (TLR2) associated MyD88-ARNO-ARF6 signaling cascade, resulting in destabilization of p120-catenin and internalization of VE-cadherin as a mechanism of deleterious impact of PGN on the endothelium.  We demonstrate for the first time that the defect in gut  function and dysbiosis in CE2-Akita mice can be favorably impacted by exogenous administration of MACs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399484>Vinculin is critical for the robustness of the epithelial cell sheet paracellular  for ions.</a></h2><p>The paracellular  function of tight junctions (TJs) in epithelial cell sheets is robustly maintained against mechanical fluctuations, by molecular mechanisms that are poorly understood. Vinculin is an adaptor of a mechanosensory complex at the adherens junction. Here, we generated vinculin KO Eph4 epithelial cells and analyzed their confluent cell-sheet properties. We found that vinculin is dispensable for the basic TJ structural  and the paracellular  function for larger solutes. However, vinculin is indispensable for the paracellular  function for ions. In addition, TJs stochastically showed dynamically distorted patterns in vinculin KO cell sheets. These KO phenotypes were rescued by transfecting full-length vinculin and by relaxing the actomyosin tension with blebbistatin, a myosin II ATPase activity inhibitor. Our findings indicate that vinculin resists mechanical fluctuations to maintain the TJ paracellular  function for ions in epithelial cell sheets.Â© 2019 Konishi et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31220438>Flavonoids from Citrus aurantium ameliorate TNBS-induced ulcerative colitis through protecting colonic mucus layer .</a></h2><p>Intestinal  injury is recognized as the main reason for ulcerative colitis (UC) which is a chronic inflammatory disease and the effective therapeutic methods remain limited. In this study, we explored the protection effects of naringenin, nobiletin and hesperetin from Citrus aurantium on colonic mucus layer . The UC mice model was induced by trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). Forty mg/kg/day of naringenin, nobiletin and hesperetin were administrated orally for 7 and 3 days before and after TNBS treatment. Then body weight, disease activity index (DAI) score and colon length were recorded. Colons were collected for immunofluorescence, RT-PCR and western blot assay. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cell-co-culture system of Caco- and RAW264.7â¯cells were used to determine activities on protecting intestinal epithelial monolayers damage. Our results showed that Naringenin, nobiletin and hesperetin alleviated body weight loss and colon shortness, decreased DAI score, and up-regulated claudin-, occludin and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression significantly. Meanwhile, the flavonoids enhanced trans epithelial electric resistance, decreased the permeability and up-regulated occludin and ZO-1 expression in LPS-damaged epithelial monolayers system. Hence, Naringnien, nobiletin and hesperetin show the regulatory effect on UC by protecting colonic mucosa layer . It is suggested the flavonoids may be new supplements for the treatment of UC.Copyright Â© 2019.

Cognition was evaluated using the Barnes maze, and cerebral perfusion was examined by arterial spin labeling. At the molecular level, Western blot and histochemical analyses were performed to analyze fibrin content, amyloid burden, neuroinflammatory activity, and blood-brain  (BBB) .Anticoagulation with dabigatran prevented memory decline, cerebral hypoperfusion, and toxic fibrin deposition in the AD mouse brain. In addition, long-term dabigatran treatment significantly reduced the extent of amyloid plaques, oligomers, phagocytic microglia, and infiltrated T cells by 23.7%, 51.8%, 31.3%, and 32.%, respectively. Dabigatran anticoagulation also prevented AD-related astrogliosis and pericyte alterations, and maintained expression of the water channel aquaporin-4 at astrocytic perivascular endfeet of the BBB.Long-term anticoagulation with dabigatran inhibited thrombin and the formation of occlusive thrombiÂ in AD; preserved cognition, cerebral perfusion, and BBB function; and ameliorated neuroinflammation and amyloid deposition in AD mice.

We investigated whether fecal proteolytic activity is increased during pouchitis and results in epithelial  dysfunction through protease activating receptor (PAR) activation, and assessed whether the intestinal microbiome may be the source of the proteases.Fecal samples were measured for protease activity using a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-casein florescence assay. Caco- cell monolayers were exposed to fecal supernatants to assess permeability to FITC-dextran. Tight junction protein  and PAR activation were assessed by immunoblot and immunofluorescence. A truncated PAR2 protein in Caco- cells was achieved by stable transfection using CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid. PAR2 activation in pouch biopsies was examined using antibodies directed to the N-terminus of the protein. Microbial composition was analyzed using Illumina MiSeq platform of the 16S rRNA gene.Ten pouchitis patients, 6 normal pouch (NP) patients and 9 healthy controls (HC) were recruited. The pouchitis patients exhibited a 5.19- and 5.35-fold higher fecal protease (FP) activity (p â¤ 0.05) compared to the NP and HC participants, respectively. The Haemophilus species was positively associated with FP activity (R=0.718, FDR<0.1).Fecal supernatants from pouchitis patients activated PAR2 on Caco- monolayers, disrupted TJ proteins, and increased epithelial permeability. PAR2 truncation in Caco- abrogated fecal protease-mediated permeability. Pouch biopsies obtained from pouchitis patients, but not from NP patients, displayed PAR2 activation.Protease-producing bacteria may increase fecal proteolytic activity that results in pouch inflammation through disruption of TJ proteins and increased epithelial permeability in a PAR2-dependent manner. This mechanism may initiate or propagate pouch inflammation.Copyright Â© 2019 European Crohnâs and Colitis Organisation (ECCO). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

This study was aimed to investigate the changes of intestinal microbiota and  function in burned mice to further comprehend the mechanisms of burn-induced intestinal  dysfunction.Samples were from mice inflicted with 30% total body surface areaÂ (TBSA) full-thickness burns. The intestinal permeability, tight junction proteins expressions, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) localization, inflammatory cytokines expressions, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents were determined. The microbial community was assessed via 16S rDNA Illumina sequencing.The intestinal permeability was increased after severe burn injury, peaking at 6âh post-burn, with approximately 20-folds of the control (â<â0.001). The expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-) was significantly altered (Â <â0.05). The ZO-1 morphology was dramatically changed following burn injury. The fecal SCFAs' contents (acetate, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate) were noticeably declined after burn injury (Â <â0.05). The expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1Î² and IL-6) in ileal mucosa were increased, whereas the expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) were decreased following burn injury (Â <â0.05).

Angiotensin (Ang) II signaling through the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor is known to promote BBB disruption. We have previously reported that exposure to a mixture of gasoline and diesel vehicle engine emissions (MVE) mediates alterations in cerebral microvasculature of C57Bl/6 mice, which is exacerbated through consumption of a high-fat (HF) diet. Thus, we investigated the hypothesis that inhalation exposure to MVE results in altered central nervous system microvascular  mediated by Ang II-AT1 signaling. Three-month-old male C57Bl/6 mice were placed on an HF or low-fat diet and exposed via inhalation to either filtered air (FA) or MVE (100 Î¼g/m3 PM) 6 h/d for 30 days. Exposure to HF+MVE resulted in a significant increase in plasma Ang II and expression of AT1 in the cerebral microvasculature. Results from a BBB coculture study showed that transendothelial electrical resistance was decreased, associated with reduced expression of claudin-5 and occludin when treated with plasma from MVE+HF animals. These effects were attenuated through pretreatment with the AT1 antagonist, Losartan. Our BBB coculture showed increased levels of astrocyte AT1 and decreased expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor and glutathione peroxidase-1, associated with increased interleukin-6 and transforming growth factor-Î² in the astrocyte media, when treated with plasma from MVE-exposed groups. Our results indicate that inhalation exposure to traffic-generated pollutants results in altered BBB , mediated through Ang II-AT1 signaling and inflammation, which is exacerbated by an HF diet.Â© The Author(s) 2019.

Expression of MMPs, especially MMP-9, correlates with BBB disruption during central nervous system inflammation. Propofol has been reported to have anti-inflammation effects. In this study, we investigated the effects of propofol on TNF-Î±-induced MMP-9 expression in human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3 cells) and explored the underlying mechanisms. The hCMEC/D3 cells were treated with propofol (25âÎ¼M), followed by TNF-Î± (25âng/mL). We showed that TNF-Î± treatment markedly increased MMP-9 expression and decreased collagen IV expression in hCMEC/D3 cells, which was blocked by pretreatment with propofol. TNF-Î±-induced downregulation of collagen IV was also reversed by MMP-9 knockdown with siRNA. We revealed that TNF-Î± upregulated MMP-9 expression in hCMEC/D3 cells through activation of Ca/CAMK II/ERK/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway; co-treatment with inhibitors of CaMK II (KN93), ERK (LY3214996), NF-ÎºB (PDTC) or Cachelator (BAPTA-AM) abrogated the effect of TNF-Î± on MMP-9 expression. We further established an in vitro BBB model by co-culturing of hCMEC/D3 cells and human astrocytes for 6 days and measuring trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) to reflect the BBB permeability. TNF-Î± treatment markedly decreased TEER value, which was attenuated by pretreatment with propofol (25âÎ¼M) or MMP-9 knockdown with siRNA. In conclusion, propofol inhibits TNF-Î±-induced MMP-9 expression in hCMEC/D3 cells via repressing the Ca/CAMKII/ERK/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway.

State-of-the-art therapeutic approaches focus on alleviating the symptoms of this disease by non-invasive and simple-to-use methods. Nasal irrigation is one of the most accepted approaches to ease nasal congestion which, if left untreated, has a negative impact on the quality of life of patients.In this study, the safety and efficacy of a novel hypertonic seawater solution for nasal lavage enriched with hyaluronic acids, eucalyptus oil, copper, and manganese salts (StÃ©rimar Stop & Protect Cold and Flu; SSPCF) have been investigated in vitro.An in vitro 3D reconstituted human nasal epithelium tissue model, MucilAirâ¢, has been used in this study to investigate the safety of SSPCF on nasal epithelium by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion. The efficacy of SSPCF was measured by mucociliary clearance (MCC), ATP release, Alcian blue and aquaporin (AQP3) stainings.SSPCF treatment respected nasal epithelium tissue  and enhanced  function without inducing a cytotoxic response. Secreted LDH and IL-8 levels were similar to untreated controls. MCC rate was increased .5-fold and ATP release decreased 87% upon SSPCF treatment, indicating improved decongestion activity. SSPCF treatment after hypotonic stress helped recover cellular organization, as shown by Alcian blue and AQP3 staining assays.SSPCF appears as a safe and effective nasal irrigation formula that may alleviate the symptoms associated with common cold such as nasal congestion.Â© 2019 Huang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31454490>Astrocyte-derived fatty acid-binding protein 7 protects blood-brain  integrity through a caveolin-1/MMP signaling pathway following traumatic brain injury.</a></h2><p>The astrocyte-endothelial cell interaction is crucial for normal brain homeostasis and blood-brain  (BBB) disruption in pathological conditions. However, the mechanism by which astrocytes control BBB integrity, especially after traumatic brain injury (TBI), remains unclear. Here, we present evidence that astrocyte-derived fatty acid-binding protein 7 (FABP7), a differentiation- and migration-associated molecule, may  as a modulator of BBB permeability in a rat weight-drop model of TBI. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that TBI induced increased expression of FABP7 in astrocytes, accompanied by caveolin-1 (Cav-1) upregulation in endothelial cells. Administration of recombinant FABP7 significantly ameliorated TBI-induced neurological deficits, brain edema, and BBB permeability, concomitant with upregulation of endothelial Cav-1 and tight junction protein expression, while FABP7 knockdown resulted in the opposite effects. Furthermore, pretreatment with daidzein, a specific inhibitor of Cav-1, reversed the inhibitory effects of recombinant FABP7 on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-/9 expression and abolished its BBB protection after TBI. Altogether, these findings suggest that astrocyte-derived FABP7 upregulation may represent an endogenous protective response to BBB disruption partly mediated through a Cav-1/MMP signaling pathway following TBI.Copyright Â© 2019.

Increasing evidence has begun to reveal the molecules that are required for BBB . However, how these components are regulated remains unclear. Here we report that a matrix metalloproteinase, Mmp2, is essential for the establishment of the BBB in Drosophila. In the absence of mmp2, the BBB becomes leaky, which allows the tracer to penetrate the brain. Moreover, the expression pattern of a junctional component, Neuroglian, is altered. We also find that the regulation of the amounts of particular extracellular matrix components is critical for BBB establishment. Furthermore, the process of mesenchymal-epithelial transition of BBB-forming cells is perturbed in the absence of Mmp2. These data indicate that the presence of Mmp(s), which is typically considered to be a risk factor for BBB degradation, is essential for BBB  in Drosophila.Copyright Â© 2019 The Author(s).

Cudratricusxanthone O (CTXO) is a novel xanthone compound isolated from the root of  Bureau. Here, we investigated the beneficial effects of CTXO against PM-induced lung endothelial cell (EC)  disruption and pulmonary inflammation. Permeability, leukocyte migration, activation of proinflammatory proteins, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and histology were examined in PM-treated ECs and mice. CTXO significantly scavenged PM-induced ROS and inhibited the ROS-induced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Concurrently, CTXO activated Akt, which helped maintain endothelial . Furthermore, CTXO reduced vascular protein leakage, leukocyte infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine release in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in PM-induced lung tissues. These results indicated that CTXO may exhibit protective effects against PM-induced inflammatory lung injury and vascular hyperpermeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31381587>Fabrication of a spherical inclusion phantom for validation of magnetic resonance-based magnetic susceptibility imaging.</a></h2><p>Fabrication of a spherical multi-compartment MRI phantom is demonstrated that can be used to validate magnetic resonance (MR)-based susceptibility imaging reconstruction. The phantom consists of a 10 cm diameter gelatin sphere that encloses multiple smaller gelatin spheres doped with different concentrations of paramagnetic contrast agents. Compared to previous multi-compartment phantoms with cylindrical geometry, the phantom provides the following benefits: (1) no compartmental  materials are used that can introduce signal voids and spurious phase; () compartmental geometry is reproducible; (3) spherical susceptibility boundaries possess a ground-truth analytical phase solution for easy experimental validation; (4) spherical geometry of the overall phantom eliminates background phase due to air-phantom boundary in any scan orientation. The susceptibility of individual compartments can be controlled independently by doping. During fabrication, formalin cross-linking and water-proof surface coating effectively blocked water diffusion between the compartments to preserve the phantom's . The spherical shapes were realized by molding the inner gel compartments in acrylic spherical shells, 3 cm in diameter, and constructing the whole phantom inside a larger acrylic shell. From gradient echo images obtained at 3T, we verified that the phantom produced phase images in agreement with the theoretical prediction. Factors that limit the agreement include: air bubbles trapped at the gel interfaces, imperfect magnet shimming, and the susceptibility of external materials such as the phantom support hardware. The phantom images were used to validate publicly available codes for quantitative susceptibility mapping. We believe that the proposed phantom can provide a useful testbed for validation of MR phase imaging and MR-based magnetic susceptibility reconstruction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156139>Endothelial glycocalyx restoration by growth factors in diabetic nephropathy.</a></h2><p>The endothelial glycocalyx (eGlx) constitutes the first  to protein in all blood vessels. This is particularly noteworthy in the renal glomerulus, an ultrafiltration . Leakage of protein, such as albumin, across glomerular capillaries results in albumin in the urine (albuminuria). This is a hall mark of kidney disease and can reflect loss of blood vessel  in microvascular beds elsewhere. We discuss evidence demonstrating that targeted damage to the glomerular eGlx results in increased glomerular albumin permeability. EGlx is lost in diabetes and experimental models demonstrate loss from glomerular endothelial cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A is upregulated in early diabetes, which is associated with albuminuria. Treatment with paracrine growth factors such as VEGFC, VEGF165b and angiopoietin-1 can modify VEGFA signalling, rescue albumin permeability and restore glomerular eGlx in models of diabetes. Manipulation of VEGF receptor  signalling, or a common eGlx biosynthesis pathway by these growth factors, may protect and restore the eGlx layer.

The aim of this study was to explore whether Sodium Benzoate (NaB) could reduce neural cell apoptosis and alleviate neurological deficits after ICH. To assess the therapeutic effects of NaB, first, we measured brain water content, neurobehavior, and blood-brain  (BBB)  at 24 h after ICH in different groups. Then western blot and immunofluorescence staining (IF) were applied to test the levels of different proteins. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to observe ultra-structures within the cells in different groups. The results showed that levels of DJ-1, p-Akt and p-IÎºB kinase (IKK) increased after ICH and peaked at 24 h. Besides, NaB significantly upregulated DJ-1 in both cytoplasm and mitochondria, and also increased the levels of p-Akt, p-IKK and Bcl-/Bax ratio, but decreased the levels of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Additionally, NaB decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) while increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which then improving the neurological functions at 24 h and long-term (21 days) memory and spatial learning ability after ICH. However, the results mentioned above could be greatly reversed by MK2206 and rotenone. Therefore, we concluded that NaB could attenuate secondary brain injury via inhibiting neuronal apoptosis and reducing mitochondria-mediated oxidative stress via DJ-1/Akt/IKK/NFÎºB pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191328>Fetal Growth Restriction Alters Cerebellar Development in Fetal and Neonatal Sheep.</a></h2><p>Fetal growth restriction (FGR) complicates 5-10% of pregnancies and is associated with increased risks of perinatal morbidity and mortality. The development of cerebellar neuropathology , in response to chronic fetal hypoxia, and over the period of high risk for preterm birth, has not been previously studied. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the effects of FGR induced by placental insufficiency on cerebellar development at three timepoints in ovine fetal and neonatal development: (1) 115Â days gestational age (d GA), () 124 d GA, and (3) 1-day-old postnatal age. We induced FGR  single umbilical artery ligation (SUAL) at ~105 d GA in fetal sheep, term is ~147 d GA. Animals were sacrificed at 115 d GA, 124 d GA, and 1-day-old postnatal age; fetuses and lambs were weighed and the cerebellum collected for histopathology. FGR lambs demonstrated neuropathology within the cerebellum after birth, with a significant, ~18% decrease in the number of granule cell bodies (NeuN+ immunoreactivity) within the internal granular layer (IGL) and an ~80% reduction in neuronal extension and branching (MAP+ immunoreactivity) within the molecular layer (ML). Oxidative stress (8-OHdG+ immunoreactivity) was significantly higher in FGR lambs within the ML and the white matter (WM) compared to control lambs. The structural  of neurons was already aberrant in the FGR cerebellum at 115 d GA, and by 124 d GA, inflammatory cells (Iba-1+ immunoreactivity) were significantly upregulated and the blood-brain  (BBB) was compromised (Pearls, albumin, and GFAP+ immunoreactivity). We confirm that cerebellar injuries develop antenatally in FGR, and therefore, interventions to prevent long-term motor and coordination deficits should be implemented either antenatally or perinatally, thereby targeting neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307669>Changes in the intestinal mucosal proteome of turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) infected with haemorrhagic enteritis virus.</a></h2><p>Haemorrhagic enteritis (HE) is a viral disease affecting intestinal  and  function in turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and resulting in a significant economic loss. Sequential Windowed Acquisition of All Theoretical Fragment Ion Mass Spectra (SWATH-MS) was applied to identify crucial proteins involved in HE infection. A total of 938 proteins were identified and used to generate a reference library for SWATH-MS analysis. In total, 523 proteins were reliably quantified, and 64 proteins were found to be differentially expressed, including 49 up-regulated and 15 down-regulated proteins between healthy and HE-affected intestinal mucosa. Functional analysis suggested that these proteins were involved in the following categories of cellular pathways and metabolisms: 1) energy pathways; ) intestine lipid and amino acid metabolism; 3) oxidative stress; 4) intestinal immune response. Major findings of this study demonstrated that natural HE infection is related to the changes in abundance of several proteins involved in cell-intrinsic immune defense against viral invasion, systemic inflammation, modulation of excessive inflammation, B and T cell development and function and antigen presentation. mRNA quantitative expression demonstrated that most of the proteins involved in innate immunity that were found to be differentially abundant were produced by intestinal mucosa, suggesting its direct involvement in immune defences against HE infection.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, phycotoxins can reach cells underlying the epithelium, such as enteric glial cells (EGCs), which are involved in gut homeostasis, motility, and  . This study compared the toxicological effects of pectenotoxin- (PTX2), yessotoxin (YTX), okadaic acid (OA), azaspiracid-1 (AZA1), 13-desmethyl-spirolide C (SPX), and palytoxin (PlTX) on the rat EGC cell line CRL2690. Cell viability, morphology, oxidative stress, inflammation, cell cycle, and specific glial markers were evaluated using RT-qPCR and high content analysis (HCA) approaches. PTX2, YTX, OA, AZA1, and PlTX induced neurite alterations, oxidative stress, cell cycle disturbance, and increase of specific EGC markers. An inflammatory response for YTX, OA, and AZA1 was suggested by the nuclear translocation of NF-ÎºB. Caspase-3-dependent apoptosis and induction of DNA double strand breaks (Î³H2AX) were also observed with PTX2, YTX, OA, and AZA1. These findings suggest that PTX2, YTX, OA, AZA1, and PlTX may affect intestinal   through alterations of the human enteric glial system.

When 72 Î¼M of catechins was pre-treated, cellular cytotoxicity induced by IC of B[Î±]P in human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) was reduced by 27% and 26%, respectively.

However, the pre-treatment of catechins retained cellular  that was 1.14 times higher than with the absence of catechins. Co-consumption of catechins reduced not only the bio-accessibility of B[Î±]P in digestive fluid, but it also decreased absorption of B[Î±]P in human intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-) with a HepG2 co-culture system.

Drug disposition into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is also subject to age-related variation and can be further influenced by brain diseases affecting blood-brain  , like meningitis. Here, we developed a generic pediatric brain PBPK model to predict CSF concentrations of drugs that undergo passive transfer, including age-appropriate parameters. The model was validated for the analgesics paracetamol, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen and naproxen, and for a pediatric meningitis population by empirical optimization of the blood-brain  penetration of the antibiotic meropenem. Plasma and CSF drug concentrations derived from the literature were used to perform visual predictive checks and to calculate ratios between simulated and observed area under the concentration curves (AUCs) in order to evaluate model performance. Model-simulated concentrations were comparable to observed data over a broad age range (3 months-15 years postnatal age) for all drugs investigated. The ratios between observed and simulated AUCs (AUCo/AUCp) were within -fold difference both in plasma (range 0.92-1.09) and in CSF (range 0.64-1.23) indicating acceptable model performance. The model was also able to describe disease-mediated changes in neonates and young children (<3m postnatal age) related to meningitis and sepsis (range AUCo/AUCp plasma: 1.64-1.66, range AUCo/AUCp CSF: 1.43-1.73).

Dysbiosis may cause disruption of the intestinal , which contributes to immune activation by translocation of microbial antigens and metabolites. Intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) serves as a biomarker of enterocyte damage. The aim of this study was to investigate clinical and metabolic factors affecting plasma concentration of I-FABP in patients with psoriasis. Eighty patients with psoriasis and 40 control subjects were enrolled in the study. Serum I-FABP (243.00 (108.88-787.10) vs. 114.38 (51.60-241.60) pg/ml,  < 0.001) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR; .59 (1.96-3.09) vs. 1.72 (1.36-47 .11),  < 0.01) were significantly increased in patients with psoriasis compared to controls. A significant positive correlation was found between I-FABP and body mass index (BMI) ( = 0.82,  < 0.001), Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) ( = 0.78,  < 0.001) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) ( = 0.24,  < 0.001). Rising quartiles of I-FABP were associated with increasing values of BMI, PASI and NLR. The results of the logistic regression model confirmed an increased risk of higher disease severity with I-FABP concentration - odds ratio 3.34 per 100 pg/mL I-FABP increase. In conclusion, intestinal  in patients with psoriasis is affected by obesity, severity of the disease and systemic inflammation.

Previous studies have addressed ITN ownership, insecticide resistance, and frequency of ITN use as possible contributing factors to the high prevalence of malaria infection despite high ITN coverage, but have rarely considered whether the condition of the ITN, or how many people use it, impacts efficacy. This study assessed how ITN , ITN age, and the number of persons sharing a net might mitigate or reduce protective efficacy among self-identified ITN users in Malawi.From 2012 to 2014, six cross-sectional surveys were conducted in both the rainy and dry seasons in southern Malawi. Data were collected on ITN use,  (number and size of holes), and age. Blood samples for detecting Plasmodium falciparum infection were obtained from reported ITN users over 6Â months of age. Generalized linear mixed models were used to account for clustering at the household and community level. The final model controlled for gender, household eaves, and community-level infection prevalence during the rainy season.There were 9646 ITN users with blood samples across six surveys, 15% of whom tested positive for P. falciparum infection. Among children under 5Â years old, there was a 50% increased odds of P. falciparum infection among those sleeping under an ITN older than two years, compared to those using an ITN less than Â years old (ORâ=â1.50; 95% CI 1.07-.08). ITN  and number of individuals sharing an ITN were not associated with P. falciparum infection.Older ITNs were associated with higher rates of P. falciparum in young children, which may indicate that insecticide concentrations play a larger role in infection prevention than the physical  of an ITN. ITN use was self-reported and the  measures lacked the precision of newer methods, suggesting a need for objective measures of ITN use and more precise assessment of ITN .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619074>Effect of both selenium and biosynthesized nanoselenium particles on cadmium-induced neurotoxicity in albino rats.</a></h2><p>Because cadmium (Cd) is not naturally degradable by ecosystems, it interferes with many types of food chains.

Cd penetrates and accumulates in neurons in the brains of rats. This study reveals that Cd decreases antioxidant enzymes and increases oxidative stress in the brain. In addition, Cd increases lipid peroxidation of brain tissues. Cd increases the expression of the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene. It also affects cholinergic, glutamatergic, gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABAergic), dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine neurotransmitters in brain tissue. Consequently, Cd increases the formation of amyloid Î², a neurotoxic index, and induces apoptosis by changing the quality and the quantity of Bcl-, Bax and p53 proteins.

Goblet cells are a specialized cell type of IEC that secrete Trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) to regulate mucus viscosity and wound healing, but whether TFF3-responsiveness requires a receptor is unclear. Here, we show that leucine rich repeat receptor and nogo-interacting protein  (LINGO2) is essential for TFF3-mediated functions. LINGO2 immunoprecipitates with TFF3, co-localizes with TFF3 on the cell membrane of IEC, and allows TFF3 to block apoptosis. We further show that TFF3-LINGO2 interactions disrupt EGFR-LINGO2 complexes resulting in enhanced EGFR signaling. Excessive basal EGFR activation in Lingo2 deficient mice increases disease severity during colitis and augments immunity against helminth infection. Conversely, TFF3 deficiency reduces helminth immunity. Thus, TFF3-LINGO2 interactions de-repress inhibitory LINGO2-EGFR complexes, allowing TFF3 to drive wound healing and immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30977499>Dietary l-tryptophan alleviated LPS-induced intestinal  injury by regulating tight junctions in a Caco- cell monolayer model.</a></h2><p>The intestinal epithelial layer forms a  through cell-cell tight junctions and breaking or even slightly disrupting this  can lead to serious pathological consequences, including infection and inflammation. Various amino acids have been shown to improve the intestinal tract, but the effect of tryptophan on the intestinal  has been controversial. Here, an in vitro Caco- cell model was built to investigate the protective and reparative effects of different concentrations of dietary l-Tryptophan (l-Trp) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intestinal tight junction injury. Lower concentrations (40 Î¼M) of dietary l-Trp protected and repaired the  and permeability injury of the intestinal tight junction induced by LPS, while high concentrations (80 Î¼M) may not have a positive effect. LPS-induced injury led to increased (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of Nuclear factor-kappa B (NFÎºB) and Myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), and decreased (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/ (ERK1/) and Mitogen-activated protein (MAP), and the treatment of dietary l-Trp alleviated those regulations in different concentrations, which suggests that dietary l-Trp may attenuate LPS-induced injury to tight junctions via inhibiting the NFÎºB-MLCK signaling pathway and activating the ERK1/-MAP signaling pathway. And the mRNA and protein expressions of claudin-1, occludin and ZO-1 in LPS-induced injury were all down-regulated to varying degrees, and dietary l-Trp weakened the down-regulation of claudin-1 (P < 0.05) with no significant regulation of the protein expression of occludin and ZO-1 (P > 0.05).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31223255>Filaggrin and atopic march.</a></h2><p>There is an increasing number of experimental, genetic and clinical evidence of atopic dermatitis expression as a pre-condition for later development of other atopic diseases such as asthma, food allergy and allergic rhinitis.

Principally, several factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are up-regulated or induced in response to hypoxia thus adversely affecting the blood-retinal  (BRB), resulting in retinal edema and neovascularisation. Furthermore, current evidence supports a dysregulation of the inner retinal neural-vascular  as a critical factor driving retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death and visual loss. The principal objective of this study was to interrogate whether Substance P (SP), a constitutive neurotransmitter of amacrine and ganglion cells, may protect against N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxic apoptosis of ganglion cells and VEGF-induced vessel leakage in the retina. Tight junctional protein expression and a Vascular Permeability Image Assay were used to determine vascular  in vitro. The protective effect of SP on RGC was established in ex vivo retinal explants and in vivo murine models. After NMDA administration, a reduction in TUNEL+Â cells and a maintained number of Brn-3a+Â cells were found, indicating an inhibition of RGC apoptosis mediated by SP. Additionally, SP maintained endothelial tight junctions and decreased VEGF-induced vascular permeability. In conclusion, administration of SP protects against NMDA apoptosis of RGC and VEGF-induced endothelial  breakdown.Copyright Â© 2019.

The blood-spinal cord  consists of pericytes, astrocytes, and endothelial cells, which are collectively termed the neurovascular unit. These cells support spinal cord homeostasis by expressing tight junction proteins. Physical trauma to the spinal cord disrupts the , which leads to neuroinflammation by facilitating immune cell migration to the damaged site in a process involving immune cell adhesion. Immunosuppressive strategies, including methylprednisolone (MPSS), have been investigated to treat SCI. However, despite some success, MPSS has the potential to increase a patient's susceptibility to wound infection and impaired wound healing. Hence, immunomodulation may be a more attractive approach than immunosuppression. Approved for modulating neuroinflammation in certain disorders, including Guillain-Barre syndrome, intravenous administration of human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) has shown promise in the setting of experimental SCI, though the optimal dose and mechanism of action remain undetermined.Female adult Wistar rats were subjected to moderate-severe clip compression injury (35âg) at the C7-T1 level and randomized to receive a single intravenous (IV) bolus of hIgG (0.02, 0., 0.4, 1, âg/kg), MPSS (0.03âg/kg), or control buffer at 15âmin post-SCI. At 24âh and 6âweeks post-SCI, molecular, histological, and neurobehavioral effects of hIgG were analyzed.At 24âh post-injury, human immunoglobulin G co-localized with spinal cord pericytes, astrocytes, and vessels. hIgG (âg/kg) protected the spinal cord neurovasculature after SCI by increasing tight junction protein expression and reducing inflammatory enzyme expression. Improvements in vascular  were associated with changes in spinal cord inflammation. Interestingly, hIgG (âg/kg) increased serum expression of inflammatory cytokines and co-localized (without decreasing protein expression) with spinal cord vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, a protein used by immune cells to enter into inflamed tissue. Acute molecular benefits of hIgG (âg/kg) led to greater tissue preservation, functional blood flow, and neurobehavioral recovery at 6âweeks post-SCI. Importantly, the effects of hIgG (âg/kg) were superior to control buffer and hIgG (0.4âg/kg), and comparable with MPSS (0.03âg/kg).hIgG (âg/kg) is a promising therapeutic approach to mitigate secondary pathology in SCI through antagonizing immune cell infiltration at the level of the neurovascular unit.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163193>Parametric investigation of static and dynamic cell culture conditions and their impact on hCMEC/D3  properties.</a></h2><p>In brain research, the hCMEC/D3 cell line is widely used for the establishment of a human in vitro blood-brain  (BBB) model. However, its   seems to be insufficient for drug permeability studies, represented by rather low transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and high permeability of small molecules. Therefore, this study covers a parametric investigation of static and dynamic cell culture conditions to improve  functionality of hCMEC/D3. The effect of basal media was investigated by analyzing changes in proliferation rate,   and gene expression of cellular junction proteins. The cells were able to grow in different cell culture media, including serum-free media. However, none of these media enhanced strongly the growth rate or   compared to the microvascular endothelial cell growth medium- (EGMâ¢- MV). Furthermore, hCMEC/D3 cells did not respond positively regarding TEER to any tested parameter neither supplements, coating materials nor co-cultures with the human immortalized astrocyte cell line SVGmm. Furthermore, the impact of dynamic conditions was examined by using the Dynamic Micro Tissue Engineering System (DynaMiTES). Cultivation conditions were successfully adapted to the DynaMiTES design and no negative effect was detected by analyzing cell viability and cell count, albeit TEER remained also unchanged. Consequently, the hCMEC/D3 model has considerable limitations and further improvements or alternative cell lines are required.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the neurobiological basis of AKI-induced brain disorders and their mediators are poorly understood. This study was aimed to find out the links between AKI and brain injury and also the underlying cellular and electrophysiological mechanisms of memory deficit following induction of AKI via different experimental models of renal ischemia with or without uremia and uremia without renal ischemia. Fifty four male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups that underwent 1-h bilateral or -h unilateral renal ischemia followed by 1-day reperfusion (BIR and UIR, respectively), and 1-day following bilateral nephrectomy (BNX) or sham-operation. There were  subgroups in each group, which blood-brain  (BBB)  was evaluated in one subgroup. The other subgroup was used for recordings electrophysiological activities of the hippocampus; and after blood sampling and sacrificing animal, the cerebral hemispheres were removed and preserved for performing stereological study and Western-blotting of caspase-3 in the left and right hippocampus, respectively. Plasma urea and creatinine and CA1 neuronal loss were largely increased by BNX and BIR, but slightly by UIR. Apoptosis was stimulated in the hippocampus intensively by BIR but moderately by UIR and BNX. However, BIR and UIR were associated with profoundly disturbed BBB, increased CA1 neuronal excitability, impaired LTP induction and memory deficit. Therefore, AKI most likely through inflammatory mediators leads to hippocampal apoptosis and electrophysiological impairments, BBB disruption and memory loss, whereas uremia may contribute to necrotic neuronal death.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

(1-3)-Î²-D-Glucan (BDG) is a fungal cell wall component which serves as a biomarker for gut   failure and microbial and fungal translocation. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether higher plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of BDG and suPAR were associated with NCI in PLWH. Paired blood and CSF samples were collected cross-sectionally from 61 male adult PLWH on ART (95% virally suppressed) who underwent a detailed NC assessment as part of the prospective CHARTER study between 2005 and 2015. BDG and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) were measured in frozen blood and CSF samples while soluble CD14 (sCD14), intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP), and CD4/CD8 ratio were measured in blood only. Spearman's rho correlation analysis assessed associations between BDG, other biomarkers, and NC performance. Median BDG levels were 18Â pg/mL in plasma (range -60Â pg/mL) and 20Â pg/mL in CSF (range 0-830Â pg/mL). Higher levels of plasma BDG were associated with worse NC performance (Spearman's rhoâ=â-â0.32; pâ=â0.013) and with the presence of NCI (pâ=â0.027). A plasma BDG cutoff of >â30Â pg/mL was 30% sensitive and 100% specific for NCI. After adjusting for age, higher plasma suPAR levels were also associated with worse NC performance (pâ<â0.01). No significant associations were observed between the remaining biomarkers and the NC variables. Plasma levels of BDG and age-adjusted suPAR may be new biomarkers for the detection of NCI in PLWH on suppressive ART.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016068>Relationship Between Neutralizing Antibodies Against Adeno-Associated Virus in the Vitreous and Serum: Effects on Retinal Gene Therapy.</a></h2><p>We determine the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to adeno-associated virus (AAV) in the vitreous humor and serum of patients with vitreoretinal diseases and investigate the relationship between NAb titers in the vitreous humor and serum.We analyzed NAbs to AAV serotypes , 5, 8, and 9 via in vitro neutralization in the vitreous humor and serum from 32 patients requiring vitrectomy for vitreoretinal diseases.

In addition to corneal transplantation, simple descemetorhexis has been proposed to treat centrally located disease with adequate peripheral cell reserve, but promoting the centripetal migration of CECs is pivotal to this strategy. Here, we show that targeting non-muscle myosin II (NMII) activity by Y27632, a ROCK inhibitor, or blebbistatin, a selective NMII inhibitor, promotes directional migration of CECs and accelerates in vitro wound healing. The lamellipodial protrusion persistence is increased, and actin retrograde flow is decreased after NMII inhibition. Counteracting lamellipodial protrusion by actin-related protein /3 (ARP2/3) inhibitor abolishes this migration-promoting effect. Although both Y27632 and blebbistatin accelerate wound healing, cell junctional  and  function are better preserved after blebbistatin treatment, leading to more rapid corneal deturgescence in rabbit corneal endothelial wounding model. Our findings indicate that NMII is a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of CEC dysfunction. KEY MESSAGES: NMII inhibition promotes directional migration and wound healing of CECs in vitro. Lamellipodial protrusion persistence is increased after NMII inhibition. Selective NMII inhibitor preserves junctional  better than ROCK inhibitor.

Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are innate-like T cells with a broad and potent antimicrobial activity important for gut mucosal . It was recently shown that MAIT cells are present in the oral mucosal tissue, but the involvement of MAIT cells in AP is unknown. Here, comparison of surgically resected AP and gingival tissues demonstrated that AP tissues express significantly higher levels of VÎ±7.-JÎ±33, VÎ±7.-JÎ±20, VÎ±7.-JÎ±12, CÎ± and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interferon (IFN)-Î³ and interleukin (IL)-17A transcripts, resembling a MAIT cell signature. Moreover, in AP tissues the MR1-restricted MAIT cells positive for MR1-5-OP-RU tetramer staining appeared to be of similar levels as in peripheral blood but consisted mainly of CD4 subset. Unlike gingival tissues, the AP microbiome was quantitatively impacted by factors like fistula and high patient age and had a prominent riboflavin-expressing bacterial feature. When merged in an integrated view, the examined immune and microbiome data in the sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis could identify bacterial relative abundances that negatively correlated with VÎ±7.-JÎ±33, CÎ±, and IL-17A transcript expressions in AP, implying that MAIT cells could play a role in the local defence at the oral tissue . In conclusion, we describe the presence of MAIT cells at the oral site where translocation of oral microbiota could take place.

Although probiotic Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) has been reported to possess immune-regulatory characteristics and can prevent diarrhea in pigs, very little information exists in relation to the specific regulatory impact of E. faecium NCIMB 11181 on NE-induced intestinal  injury of broiler chickens. This study was conducted to investigate the protective effects of probiotic E. faecium NCIMB 11181 on NE-induced intestinal  injury in broiler chickens. The study also aimed to elucidate the mechanisms that underpin these protective effects. One hundred and eighty Arbor Acres (AA) broiler chicks (one day old) were randomly assigned using a âÃâ factorial arrangement into two groups fed different levels of dietary E. faecium NCIMB 11181 (0 or âÃâ10 CFU/kg of diet) and two disease-challenge groups (control or NE challenged). The results showed that NE induced body weight loss, intestinal lesions, and histopathological inflammation, as well as intestinal-cell apoptosis. These symptoms were alleviated following the administration of probiotic E. faecium NCIMB 11181. Pretreatment with probiotic E. faecium NCIMB 11181 significantly upregulated the expression of the Claudin-1 gene encoding a tight-junction protein. Claudin-1 and HSP70 protein expression were also increased in the jejunum regardless of NE infection. Furthermore, NE-infected birds fed with E. faecium displayed notable increases in MyD88, NF-ÎºB, iNOS, PI3K, GLP-, IL-1Î², IL-4, and HSP70 mRNA expression. E. faecium NCIMB 11181 administration also significantly improved the animals' intestinal microbial composition regardless of NE treatment. These findings indicated that addition of E. faecium NCIMB 11181 to poultry feed is effective in mitigating NE-induced gut injury, possibly by strengthening intestinal mucosal  function, as well as modulating gut microflora and intestinal mucosal immune responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31346356>A Protective Role of the NRF2-Keap1 Pathway in Maintaining Intestinal  Function.</a></h2><p>Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor ) is a master regulator of cellular oxidative levels against environmental stresses.

This study investigated the role of transforming growth factor Î² (TGFÎ²), a cytokine known to induce expression of the proprotein convertase Furin, in hypoxia-mediated  compromise. We show that exposure of brain endothelial cells (ECs) to hypoxia (1% O) rapidly stimulates their migration. Additional exogenous TGFÎ² (0.4â¯nM) exposure potentiated this effect and increased Furin expression in a TGFÎ² type I receptor activin-like kinase 5 (ALK5) - dependent manner (prevented by 10â¯Î¼M SB431542). Furin inhibition prevented hypoxia-induced EC migration and blocked TGFÎ²-induced potentiation suggesting existence of a feedback loop. TGFÎ² and Furin were also critical for hypoxia-induced BBB dysfunction. TGFÎ² treatment aggravated hypoxia-induced BBB permeability but ALK5 or Furin blockade reversed injury-induced permeability changes. Thus during insult Furin compromises endothelial  by mediating the effects of TGFÎ². Targeting the Furin or ALK5 pathway may offer novel therapeutic strategies for improving BBB stability and CNS function during disease.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Their incorporation into these products may enhance oral exposure in consumer, environmental and occupational settings. Undifferentiated and differentiated monocultures of Caco- cells are commonly used to assess NM toxicity to the intestine in vitro. However, the integration of other cell types into Caco- in vitro models increases their physiological relevance. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of CuO NMs and copper sulphate (CuSO) to intestinal microfold (M) cell (Caco-/Raji B) and mucus secreting (Caco-/HT29-MTX) co-culture in vitro models via assessment of their impact on  , viability and interleukin (IL)-8 secretion. The translocation of CuO NMs and CuSO across the intestinal  was also investigated in vitro.CuO NMs and CuSO impaired the function of the intestinal  in the co-culture models [as indicated by a reduction in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and Zonular occludens (ZO-1) staining intensity]. Cu translocation was observed in both models but was greatest in the Caco-/Raji B co-culture. CuO NMs and CuSO stimulated an increase in IL-8 secretion, which was greatest in the Caco-/HT29-MTX co-culture model. CuO NMs and CuSO did not stimulate a loss of cell viability, when assessed using light microscopy, nuclei counts and scanning electron microscopy. CuO NMs demonstrated a relatively similar level of toxicity to CuO in both Caco-/Raji B and Caco-/HT29-MTX co- culture models.The Caco-/Raji B co-culture model was more sensitive to CuO NM and CuSO toxicity than the Caco-/HT29-MTX co-culture model. However, both co-culture models were less sensitive to CuO NM and CuSO toxicity than simple monocultures of undifferentiated and differentiated Caco- cells, which are more routinely used to investigate NM toxicity to the intestine. Obtained data can therefore feed into the design of future studies which assess the toxicity of substances (e.g. NMs) and pathogens to the intestine (e.g. by informing model and endpoint selection). However, more testing with a wider panel of NMs would be beneficial in order to help select which in vitro modelsÂ and endpoints to prioritise when screening the safety of ingested NMs. Comparisons with in vivo findings will also be essential to identify the most suitable in vitro model to screen the safety of ingested NMs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297080>N-acetylcysteine Amide Ameliorates Blast-Induced Changes in Blood-Brain   in Rats.</a></h2><p>Traumatic brain injury resulting from exposure to blast overpressure (BOP) is associated with neuropathology including impairment of the blood-brain  (BBB). This study examined the effects of repeated exposure to primary BOP and post-blast treatment with an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA) on the  of BBB. Anesthetized rats were exposed to three 110 kPa BOPs separated by 0.5 h. BBB  was examined  via a cranial window allowing imaging of pial microcirculation by intravital microscopy. Tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate Dextran (TRITC-Dextran, mw = 40 kDa or 150 kDa) was injected intravenously .5 h after the first BOP exposure and the leakage of TRITC-Dextran from pial microvessels into the brain parenchyma was assessed. The animals were randomized into 6 groups ( = 5/group): four groups received 40 kDa TRITC-Dextran (BOP-40, sham-40, BOP-40 NACA, and sham-40 NACA), and two groups received 150 kDa TRITC-Dextran (BOP-150 and sham-150). NACA treated groups were administered NACA  h after the first BOP exposure. The rate of TRITC-Dextran leakage was significantly higher in BOP-40 than in sham-40 group. NACA treatment significantly reduced TRITC-Dextran leakage in BOP-40 NACA group and sham-40 NACA group presented the least amount of leakage. The rate of leakage in BOP-150 and sham-150 groups was comparable to sham-40 NACA and thus these groups were not assessed for the effects of NACA. Collectively, these data suggest that BBB  is compromised following BOP exposure and that NACA treatment at a single dose may significantly protect against blast-induced BBB breakdown.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121956>L-tryptophan Enhances Intestinal  in Diquat-Challenged Piglets Associated with Improvement of Redox Status and Mitochondrial Function.</a></h2><p>Tryptophan (Trp) supplementation has been shown to improve growth performance and enhance intestinal  in piglets. However, the effects of dietary Trp supplementation on the intestinal  function in piglets exposed to oxidative stress remain unknown. This study was conducted to evaluate whether dietary Trp supplementation can attenuate intestinal injury, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction of piglets caused by diquat injection. Thirty-two piglets at 25 days of age were randomly allocated to four groups: (1) the non-challenged control; () diquat-challenged control; (3) 0.15% Trp-supplemented diet + diquat; (4) 0.30% Trp supplemented diet + diquat.

Dietary supplementation with 0.15% Trp improved growth performance of diquat-challenged piglets from day 7 to 21. Diquat induced an increased intestinal permeability, impaired antioxidant capacity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although dietary supplementation with 0.15% Trp ameliorated these negative effects induced by diquat challenge that showed decreasing permeability of 4 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran, increasing antioxidant indexes, and enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis.

However, reperfusion injuries such as oedema and haemorrhagic transformation largely limit the use of this potent treatment to a narrow time window. Recently, transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) channel has emerged as a potential target for vascular protection in stroke management. Non-specificity and side effects are major concerns for current TRPM4 blockers. The present study was undertaken to develop a novel TRPM4 blocker for stroke management. We report the generation of a TRPM4-specific antibody M4P which binds to a region close to the channel pore. M4P could inhibit TRPM4 current and downregulate TRPM4 surface expression, therefore prevent hypoxia-induced cell swelling. In the rat model of 3-h stroke reperfusion, application of M4P at  h after occlusion ameliorated reperfusion injury by improving blood-brain  , and enhanced functional recovery. Our results demonstrate that TRPM4 blockade could attenuate reperfusion injury in stroke recanalization. When applied together with reperfusion treatments, TRPM4 blocking antibody has the potential to extend the therapeutic time window for acute ischemic stroke.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31342870>Inhibitory effects of compounds isolated from  Decne peel on particulate matter-induced pulmonary injury in mice.</a></h2><p>Particulate matter .5 (PM), with an aerodynamic diameter of â¤.5Â Î¼m, is the primary air pollutant that plays a key role associated with lung injury produced by loss of vascular  .

The aim of this study was to (1) identify the bioactive compounds present in  peel which may be responsible for inhibition of PM-induced pulmonary inflammation in mice and () examine  mechanisms underlying the observed effects of these compounds on mouse lung microvascular endothelial cells. The measured parameters include permeability, leukocyte migration, proinflammatory protein activation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and histology. Two phenanthrene compounds, ,7-dihydroxy-4,6-dimethoxyphenanthrene (1) and 6,7-dihydroxy-,4-dimethoxyphenanthrene () were isolated from  peels. Both these phenanthrene compounds exhibited significant scavenging activity against PM-induced ROS and inhibited ROS-induced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. In addition, enhancement of Akt pathway, involved in the maintenance of endothelial , was noted. These phenanthrene compounds also reduced vascular protein leakage, leukocyte infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine release in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from PM-induced lung tissues.

Milk polar lipids, lipids derived from the milk fat globule membrane, could positively affect the aforementioned obesity-related endpoints. This study aimed to test the hypotheses that milk polar lipids will reduce gut permeability, systemic inflammation, and liver lipid levels, and differentially affect the hepatic expression of genes associated with fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol regulation in preexisting obesity. We fed 3 groups of C57BL/6J ob/ob mice (n = 6 per group) for  wk: (1) a modified AIN-93G diet (CO) with 34% fat by energy; () CO with milk gangliosides (GG) at 0. g/kg of diet; and (3) CO with milk phospholipids (PL) at 10 g/kg of diet. The GG and PL were provided as semi-purified concentrates and replaced .0% and 7.% of dietary fat by energy. The GG and PL did not affect total food intake, weight gain, fasting glucose, or gut permeability. The PL decreased liver mass and the mesenteric fat depot compared with the CO. The GG increased tight junction protein occludin in colon mucosa compared with the CO. The GG and PL decreased tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 in jejunum mucosa compared with the CO. Plasma endotoxin increased during the study but was unaffected by the treatments. Compared with the CO and GG, the PL increased plasma sphingomyelin and plasma IL-6. The GG and PL differentially regulated genes associated with lipid metabolism in the liver compared with the CO. Regarding general effects on lipid metabolism, the GG and PL decreased lipid levels in the liver and the mesenteric depot, and increased lipid levels in the plasma. Diet consumption decreased significantly when the ob/ob mice were kept in metabolic cages, which were not big enough and resulted in unwanted animal deaths. Future studies may keep this in mind and use better metabolic equipment for ob/ob mice. In conclusion, dietary milk polar lipids may have limited beneficial effects on gut  , systemic inflammation, and lipid metabolism in the context of severe obesity.Copyright Â© 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Due to its immunomodulatory effect, vitamin D plays a role in chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and a deficiency is associated with an increased risk for a flare. We aimed to investigate to what extent the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D3) level correlates with disease activity and whether a cut-off value can be defined that discriminates between active disease and remission.Patients with IBD, treated at the University Hospital Frankfurt were analyzed retrospectively. The 25(OH)D3 levels were correlated with clinical activity indices and laboratory chemical activity parameters. A deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D3 levels <30 ng/mL.A total of 470 (257 female) patients with IBD were included, 272 (57.9%) with Crohn's disease (CD), 198 (42.1%) with ulcerative colitis (UC). The median age of the patients was 41 (18-84). In 283 patients (60.%), a vitamin D deficiency was detected. 245 (53.6%) patients received oral vitamin D supplementation, and supplemented patients had significantly higher vitamin D levels (p < 0.0001). Remission, vitamin D substitution, and male gender were independently associated with the 25(OH)D3 serum concentration in our cohort in regression analysis. A 25(OH)D3 serum concentration of 27.5 ng/mL was the optimal cut-off value.Vitamin D deficiency is common in IBD patients and appears to be associated with increased disease activity.

In , the scaffolding proteins Scribble (Scrib) and Discs Large (Dlg) are key regulators of epithelial polarity, proliferation, assembly of junctions and protein trafficking. We found that Scrib and Dlg are necessary for the formation of the tricellular junction (TCJ), a unique junction that forms in epithelia at the point of convergence of three neighboring cells. Scrib and Dlg are in close proximity with the TCJ proteins Gliotactin (Gli) and Bark Beetle (Bark), and both are required for TCJ protein recruitment. Loss of Bark or Gli led to basolateral spread of the TCJ complex at the cell corners. Loss of the septate junction proteins Nrx-IV and the Na/K ATPase also resulted in basolateral spread of the entire TCJ complex at the cell corners.

After ingestion, intestinal mucosa constitutes the first biological  that can be exposed to high concentrations of these toxins. The present study aimed to characterize the combined cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and impact on the gastrointestinal   of patulin (PAT, 0.7 Î¼M to 100 Î¼M) and ochratoxin A (OTA, 1 Î¼M to 200 Î¼M) mixtures in Caco- cells. A dose-ratio deviation was verified for cytotoxicity, implying that OTA was mainly responsible for synergism when dominant in the mixture, while this pattern was changed to antagonism for the highest PAT concentrations. Genotoxicity (comet assay) results were compatible with an interactive DNA damaging effect at the highest PAT and OTA concentrations, not clearly mediated by the formation of oxidative DNA breaks. Regarding gastrointestinal  , a potential synergism was attained at low levels of both mycotoxins, changing to antagonism at higher doses. The present results indicate that combined mycotoxins effects may arise at the intestinal level and should not be underestimated when evaluating their risk to human health.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Î²-Arrestin  (Arrb2) is highly expressed in brain tissues and plays a key role in the regulation of systemic immune reactions by modulating various signaling pathways. However, the expression of Arrb2 in microglial cells and its influence on HSE prognosis is still undefined. We explore the pathophysiological effect of Arrb2 in the brain using experimental HSE mice. The expression of Arrb2 in microglia was decreased significantly 48âhours following HSV-1 infection. Arrb2 overexpression transgenic (TG) mice had a significantly lower mortality and survival rate was improved by 40% compared to wild-type mice. Arrb2 suppressed the generation of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-Î± and IL-6 and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-4 expression. Arrb2 also inhibited the activation of the transcription factor NF-ÎºB in microglial cells. Arrb2 TG mice attenuated the blood-brain  breakdown and relieved cerebral edema, meanwhile, Arrb2 improved mice neurological function compared with wild-type mice. Overall, Arrb2 favored microglia of the M2 phenotype, attenuated brain proinflammatory responses, protected the blood vessel wall , reduced HSV-1-induced neurological impairment, and improved the survival rate in HSE mice.Â© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31133850>Nanofibrous Scaffolds Support a 3D  Permeability Model of the Human Intestinal Epithelium.</a></h2><p>Advances in drug research not only depend on high throughput screening to evaluate large numbers of lead compounds but also on the development of  models which can simulate human tissues in terms of drug permeability and functions. Potential failures, such as poor permeability or interaction with efflux drug transporters, can be identified in epithelial Caco- monolayer models and can impact a drug candidate's progression onto the next stages of the drug development process. Whilst monolayer models demonstrate reasonably good prediction of  permeability for some compounds, more developed  tools are needed to assess new entities that enable closer  correlation. In this study, an  model of the human intestinal epithelium was developed by utilizing nanofibers, fabricated using electrospinning, to mimic the structure of the basement membrane. We assessed Caco- cell response to these materials and investigated the physiological properties of these cells cultured on the fibrous supports, focusing on   and drug-permeability properties. The obtained data illustrate that 2D Caco- Transwell cultures exhibit artificially high trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) compared to cells cultured on the 3D nanofibrous scaffolds which show TEER values similar to  porcine tissue (also measured in this study). Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the 3D nanofibrous scaffolds influence the   of the Caco- monolayer to confer drug-absorption properties that more closely mimic native gut tissue particularly for studying passive epithelial transport. We propose that this 3D model is a suitable  model for investigating drug absorption and intestinal metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048574>The impact of modulating the blood-brain  on the electrophysiological and histological outcomes of intracortical electrodes.</a></h2><p>Successful application of chronic intracortical electrodes remains highly variable. The biological mechanisms leading to electrode failure are still being explored. Recent work has shown a correlation between blood-brain  (BBB)  and long-term recordings. Here we proposed to modulate the BBB healing after intracortical electrode implantation, while evaluating the functional electrophysiology. The CCL2/CCR2 pathway was chosen based on previous work demonstrating the positive histological effects in an intracortical electrode model, as well as in other neurodegenerative models. By disrupting this pathway, recruitment of pro-inflammatory monocytes (a result of a breached BBB) is potentially reduced at the electrode interface.Michigan electrodes were implanted for  and 12 weeks in rats, and a CCR2 antagonist (RS 102895) was administered daily to the treatment group. Functional electrodes were used for the 12 week cohort, and weekly electrophysiological recordings were taken. At  and 12 weeks, histology was analyzed.At 12 weeks, the CCR2-antagonist group had significantly higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) than control. CCR2-antagonism at  weeks significantly increased the neural population and decreased BBB breach. At 12 weeks, CCR2-antagonism significantly increased number of neurons and BBBââ+ââvasculature within 100 Âµm of the electrode interface.This work demonstrates that for intracortical electrodes, disruption of the CCL2/CCR2 pathway improves chronic outcomes in electrophysiology and histology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31321963>Morphological and functional alterations of astrocytes responding to traumatic brain injury.</a></h2><p>Astrocytes, one of the most abundant and heterogeneous types of glial cell in the brain and spinal cord, are responsible for various essential functions in the healthy central nervous system, including maintaining the blood brain  , regulating neuron differentiation and supporting, nourishing, protecting, insulating and repairing neurons.

They then exhibit heterogeneous gene expression and changes in morphology, proliferative capacity and various functions in response either acute or chronic brain injury and associated secondary brain injury. Some biomarkers and imaging tools have been used to monitor astrogliosis after traumatic brain injury. Initially, morphological characteristics and the physiology of astrocytes are reviewed. Subsequently, alterations of astrocytes are described, which includes both the complex mechanisms and roles of reactive astrocytes. The roles of biomarkers and signaling pathways following traumatic brain injury have been summarized as well as the morphological and functional changes in astrocytes. In the latter case, by considering astrocytes as therapeutic targets of traumatic brain injury, the mechanisms of the latest drug treatments are explained.

Through intravenous delivery of NLC-Î²-secretase 1 (BACE1) siRNA complexes we show effective BACE1 down-regulation in the brain without toxicity and inflammation. Therefore, NLCs act as safe multifunctional nanocarriers, overcome efficacy and specificity limitations in active targeting with nanoparticles bearing phage display peptides or cell-penetrating peptides and expand the receptor repertoire of the display peptide.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31532211>Methionine and Its Hydroxyl Analogues Improve Stem Cell Activity To Eliminate Deoxynivalenol-Induced Intestinal Injury by Reactivating Wnt/Î²-Catenin Signaling.</a></h2><p>The intestinal epithelium is derived from intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and has direct contact with nutrients and toxins. However, whether methionine (Met) or a methionine hydroxyl analogue (-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)butanoic acid (HMB)) can alleviate deoxynivalenol (DON)-induced intestinal injury remains unknown. Mice were treated orally with Met or HMB on days 1-11 and with DON on days 4-8. On day 12, the mice were sacrificed, and the jejunum was collected for crypt isolation and culture. Mouse enteroids were treated with DON and Met or HMB ex vivo. The results showed that Met and HMB increased the average daily feed intake and average daily gain of the mice. Met and HMB also improved the jejunal structure and   and promoted ISC expansion, as indicated by the increased enteroid formation efficiency and area, under DON-induced injury conditions. In addition, DON-induced decreases in ISC activity were rescued Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling reactivation by Met or HMB in vivo and ex vivo. Collectively, our findings reveal that Met and HMB alleviated DON-induced intestinal injury by improving ISC expansion and reactivating Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling.

Aucubin (AU) is the active ingredient extracted from Eucommia ulmoides. However, its protective action and exact mechanism on testicular injury is not yet known.Here, the protective effect and the mechanism of action of AU on testis damage under oxidative stress was investigated in vivo and in vitro.As regard the in vivo experiment, male mice were divided into five groups and testicular injury model was established by Triptolide (TP) (120â¯Î¼g/kg) intraperitoneal injection for two weeks. Animals in the treatment group were pretreated with an intraperitoneal injection of AU at different doses (5, 10 and 20â¯mg/kg) for 1â¯h and subsequently treated with TP (120â¯Î¼g/kg). At the end of the experimental period, the testis was collected for biochemical and histological examination. As regard the in vitro experiment, Sertoli cells (SCs) were used to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of action of AU against disruption of the blood-testis- (BTB) and apoptosis induced by TP via apoptosis detection, western blot, immunofluorescence analysis, and siRNA transient transfection.TP-treated animals showed testicular atrophy, BTB disruption, increased ROS levels and spermatogenic dysfunction. Pre-administration of AU resulted in a significant protection on keeping a normal testicular weight, sperm morphology, BTB integrity, and a normal level of oxidative stress markers and antioxidants. Furthermore, AU prevented apoptosis through an effective inhibition of PERK/CHOP and JNK dependent apoptosis pathway, as well as protected the integrity of BTB by up-regulating the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin-11) and gap junction protein (Cx43). The mechanistic study revealed that AU significantly triggered Nrf2 translocation, thus increasing nuclear Nrf2 accumulation and then induced antioxidant enzymes expression in the testis and SCs. Furthermore, Nrf2 silencing unsuccessfully reversed the increased CHOP and p-JNK expression induced by TP, abolishing the protective effect of AU.These results indicate that AU might be considered as a potential protective agent against testicular injury.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of pericytes in the repair process of BBB functions triggered by PDGFRÎ² up-regulation. Here, we show that perlecan, a major heparan sulfate proteoglycan of basement membranes, aids in BBB maintenance and repair through pericyte interactions. Using a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model, we found larger infarct volumes and more BBB leakage in conditional perlecan ()-deficient (    TG) mice than in control mice. Control mice showed increased numbers of pericytes in the ischemic lesion, whereas     TG mice did not. At the mechanistic level, pericytes attached to recombinant perlecan C-terminal domain V (perlecan DV, endorepellin). Perlecan DV enhanced the PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of PDGFRÎ², SHP-, and FAK partially through integrin Î±5Î²1 and promoted pericyte migration. Perlecan therefore appears to regulate pericyte recruitment through the cooperative functioning of PDGFRÎ² and integrin Î±5Î²1 to support BBB maintenance and repair following ischemic stroke.This is a work of the U.S. Government and is not subject to copyright protection in the United States.

The kinase RIPK4 and the transcription factor IRF6 are mutated in severe developmental syndromes in humans, and mice lacking these genes display epidermal hyperproliferation and soft-tissue fusions that result in neonatal lethality. Our understanding of how these genes control epidermal differentiation is incomplete. Here we show that the role of RIPK4 in mouse development requires its kinase activity; that RIPK4 and IRF6 expressed in the epidermis regulate the same biological processes; and that the phosphorylation of IRF6 at Ser413 and Ser424 primes IRF6 for activation. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), histone chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) of skin in wild-type and IRF6-deficient mouse embryos, we define the transcriptional programs that are regulated by IRF6 during epidermal differentiation. IRF6 was enriched at bivalent promoters, and IRF6 deficiency caused defective expression of genes that are involved in the metabolism of lipids and the formation of tight junctions. Accordingly, the lipid composition of the stratum corneum of Irf6 skin was abnormal, culminating in a severe defect in the function of the epidermal . Collectively, our results explain how RIPK4 and IRF6 function to ensure the  of the epidermis and provide mechanistic insights into why developmental syndromes that are characterized by orofacial, skin and genital abnormalities result when this axis goes awry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31222489>Cholera toxin perturbs the paracellular  in the small intestinal epithelium of rats by affecting claudin- and tricellulin.</a></h2><p>Cholera toxin is commonly known to induce chloride secretion of the intestine. In recent years, effects on epithelial  function have been reported, indicating synergistic co-regulation of transporters and tight junction proteins. Our current study focused on the analysis of cholera toxin effects on transepithelial resistance and on tight junction proteins, the latter known as structural correlates of  function. Ligated segments of the rat jejunum were injected with buffered solution containing cholera toxin (1Â Î¼g/ml) and incubated for 4Â h. Subsequently, selfsame tissue specimens were mounted in Ussing chambers, and cholera toxin (1Â Î¼g/ml) was added on the apical side. Transepithelial resistance and permeability of sodium fluorescein (376Â Da) were analyzed. Subsequently, tissues were removed, expression and localization of claudins were analyzed, and morphological studies were performed employing transmission electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cholera toxin induced a marked decrease in transepithelial resistance in the rat jejunal epithelium and an increase in paracellular permeability for sodium fluorescein. Immunoblotting of tight junction proteins revealed an increase in claudin- signals, which was verified by confocal laser scanning immunofluorescence microscopy, and a decrease in tricellulin, whereas other tight junction proteins remained unchanged. Transmission electron microscopy showed a reduction in the number of microvilli after incubation with cholera toxin. Moreover, cholera toxin led to a widening of the intercellular space between enterocytes. In accordance with the commonly known prosecretory effect of cholera toxin, our study revealed a complementary effect on small intestinal  function and , which might constitute a pathomechanism with high relevance for prevention and therapeutic approaches.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31251471>Bryostatin-1 ameliorated experimental colitis in Il-10 Mice by protecting the intestinal  and limiting immune dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Bryostatin-1 (Bry-1) has been proven to be effective and safe in clinical trials of a variety of immune-related diseases. However, little is known about its effect on Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to investigate the impact of Bry-1 on CD-like colitis and determine the mechanism underlying this effect. In the present study, 15-week-old male Il-10 mice with spontaneous colitis were divided into positive control and Bry-1-treated (Bry-1, 30Â Î¼g/kg every other day, injected intraperitoneally for 4Â weeks) groups. Age-matched, male wild-type (WT) mice were used as a negative control. The effects of Bry-1 on colitis, intestinal  function and T cell responses as well as the potential regulatory mechanisms were evaluated. We found that the systemic delivery of Bry-1 significantly ameliorated colitis in Il-10 mice, as demonstrated by decreases in the disease activity index (DAI), inflammatory score and proinflammatory mediator levels. The protective effects of Bry-1 on CD-like colitis included the maintenance of intestinal   and the helper T cell (Th)/regulatory T cell (Treg) balance. These effects of Bry-1 may act in part through nuclear factor erythroid -related factor  (Nrf2) signalling activation and STAT3/4 signalling inhibition. The protective effect of Bry-1 on CD-like colitis suggests Bry-1 has therapeutic potential in human CD, particularly given the established clinical safety of Bry-1.Â© 2019 The Authors.

However, a functional role of the ER in the enterocytes of weanling piglets and its contribution to intestinal mucosal  remain largely unknown.This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that preweaning administration of Gln alleviates the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) in the small intestine of weanling piglets.Eighteen sow-reared piglets aged 7 d from 3 litters (6 piglets/litter) were assigned randomly into 1 of 3 treatment groups. Piglets were reared by sows until age 24 d, or were reared by sows and orally administered either l-alanine [1.84 g Â· kg body weight (BW)-1 Â· d-1] or Gln (1.52 g Â· kg BW-1 Â· d-1) twice daily between 7 and 21 d of age, and then weaned to a corn- and soybean meal-based diet. The small-intestinal samples were collected at 24 d of age for analyses of abundance of proteins related to ER stress and apoptosis, concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, and mRNA abundance for genes implicated in protein degradation.Compared with age-matched suckling piglets, weaning stress increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation in the jejunum. The abundance of proteins related to ER stress [binding immunoglobulin protein, activating transcription factor 6Î±, phosphorylated (p)-inositol-requiring kinase 1Î±, and p-eukaryotic initiation factor Î±] was elevated by 200% to 320%, and that of apoptotic proteins (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, p-Jun-N-terminal kinase, caspase-12, cleaved caspase-3, and Bcl--associated X) was augmented by 100% to 350% in the jejunum of weanling piglets. The protein abundance for IL-1Î², TNF-Î±, and IL-8 was increased by 100% to 230% in the jejunum of weanling piglets. These alterations in gene and protein expression were markedly abrogated by Gln supplementation. The mRNA concentration of F-Box protein 32 in the jejunum of weanling piglets was increased by 70%, compared with the control group, and was not affected by Gln supplementation.Our results indicate that preweaning administration of Gln to nursing piglets alleviates the weaning-activated UPR.Copyright Â© American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31517482>16Î±-Hydroxytrametenolic Acid from  Improves Intestinal  Function Through the Glucocorticoid Receptor-Mediated PI3K/Akt/NF-ÎºB Pathway.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated the effect of triterpenoids from edible mushroom  on intestinal epithelium  and revealed the transcriptional regulatory pathways that underpin restorative mechanisms in the gut. Based on computational docking studies, transcriptional activation experiments and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein immunofluorescence localization assays in cultured cells, 16Î±-hydroxytrametenolic acid (HTA) was discovered as a novel GR agonist in this study. HTA ameliorates TNF-Î±-induced Caco- monolayer intestinal epithelial  damage and suppressed activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt), which attenuated downstream IÎºB and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-ÎºB) phosphorylation through GR activation.

The aim of this study was to reveal the in vitro gastrointestinal protective effects of BP against IBD using molecular and metabolic methods. Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) challenged Caco- cell monolayers were applied to mimic intestinal epithelial cell dysfunctions and metabolic disorders. The pretreatment with BP extract rich in polyphenols ameliorated DSS-induced cell viability losses. It also exerted protective effects against intestinal  impairment by strengthening epithelial  and tight junction losses induced by DSS. BP up-regulated anti-oxidant (NQO1, Txnrd1, Nrf2) and down-regulated inflammatory (TNF-Î± and IL-6) mRNA expressions, in accompany with MAPK signaling inhibition. Furthermore, metabolomics analysis based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS revealed that BP, and DSS treated Caco- cells have different metabolomic profiles, with significant changes on key metabolites involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism.

To assess the vascular mechanisms of LCN2, we used brain endothelial cell cultures to investigate its effects on neutrophil adhesion and endothelial  . LCN2 did not affect neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells either under normal conditions or after TNFÎ± stimulation.

In the present study we used Caco- cells as a model for intestinal epithelia and assessed the effect of three -based probiotics on intestinal  function and intestinal inflammation. Experimental results showed that one of the three tested strains, Bs 29784, significantly reinforced intestinal   under basal conditions through an up-regulation of the expression of tight junction's proteins, whereas the others had no or detrimental effects. When Caco- cells were pre-treated with  strains, the subsequent IL-8 release to various pro-inflammatory signals (IL-1Î², deoxynivalenol, or flagellin) was blunted compared to cells that had not been pretreated, but to a different extent depending on the strain of  used. Bs 29784, was able to significantly decrease IL-8 production in all stressed conditions tested. Mechanistically, Bs 29784 appeared to limit nuclear translocation of NF-ÎºB during IL-1Î² exposure by preventing IÎºB degradation. The effects of Bs 29784 were observed independently with supernatant and cells but in a lesser extent than with the combination, indicating that they can thus likely be attributed to both secreted metabolites and cell-associated compounds. Moreover, under inflammatory conditions, Bs 29784 significantly reduced the upregulation of iNOS protein levels further underlining its intestinal anti-inflammatory potential.

Vanillin (Van), a natural phenolic compound with neuroprotective properties, exerts neuroprotection on a gerbil model of global ischemia by inhibiting oxidative damage. This study aimed to explore the potential neuroprotective roles of Van in neonatal rats suffering from hypoxic-ischemic (HI). An HI model of 7-day-old SD rats was induced by left carotid artery ligation followed by exposure to 8% oxygen (balanced with nitrogen) for .5â¯h at 37â¯Â°C. At 48â¯h after intraperitoneal injection with Van (20, 40, and 80â¯mg/kg) or saline, neurobehavioral function, cerebral infract volume, brain water content, and histomorphological changes were performed to evaluate brain injury. Transmission electron microscopy and immunoglobulin G (IgG) staining were conducted to evaluate the  of the blood-brain  (BBB). The levels of oxidative stress and tight junction proteins, as well as the activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), were also determined in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Results showed that Van post-treatment significantly ameliorated early neurobehavioral deficits, decreased infarct volume and brain edema, as well as attenuated histopathologic injury and IgG extravasation. Furthermore, Van markedly increased the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and decreased malondialdehyde content. Meanwhile, the activation of MMP- and MMP-9 induced by HI was partially blocked by Van. Finally, Van obviously increased the expression of ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-5 compared with the HI group. Collectively, Van can provide neuroprotective effects against neonatal HIBD possibly by attenuating oxidative damage and preserving BBB .Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors.

MC025-collismycin C () and pyrisulfoxin A (5)-were found to inhibit PM-mediated vascular  disruption.To confirm the inhibitory effects of collismycin C and pyrisulfoxin A on PM-induced pulmonary injury STUDY DESIGN: In this study, we investigated the beneficial effects of collismycin C and pyrisulfoxin A on PM-induced lung endothelial cell (EC)  disruption and pulmonary inflammation.Permeability, leukocyte migration, proinflammatory protein activation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and histology were evaluated in PM-treated ECs and mice.Collismycin C and pyrisulfoxin A significantly scavenged PM-induced ROS and inhibited the ROS-induced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase as well as activated Akt, which helped in maintaining endothelial , in purified pulmonary endothelial cells. Furthermore, collismycin C and pyrisulfoxin A reduced vascular protein leakage, leukocyte infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine release in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of PM-treated mice.These data suggested that collismycin C and pyrisulfoxin A might exert protective effects on PM-induced inflammatory lung injury and vascular hyperpermeability.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Increased gut permeability and systemic exposure to microbial products are key drivers of this inflammation. Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) supports gut healing in other conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease.In this randomized, double-blind study, participants receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) with chronic diarrhea received placebo or SBI at .5 g BID or 5 g BID for 4 weeks, followed by a 20-week placebo-free extension phase with SBI at either .5 or 5 g BID. Intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), zonulin, flagellin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-binding protein, and inflammatory markers were measured by ELISA or multiplex assays. Non-parametric tests were used for analysis.One hundred three participants completed the study. By week 24 SBI significantly decreased circulating levels of I-FABP (-0.35 ng/Î¼L, =0.002) and zonulin (-4.90 ng/Î¼L, 0.003), suggesting improvement in gut damage, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (-0.40 pg/Î¼L, =0.002), reflecting improvement in systemic inflammation. In participants with the lowest quartile of CD4+ T-cell counts at baseline (189-418 cells/Î¼L), CD4+ T-cell counts increased significantly (26 cells/Î¼L; =0.002).Oral SBI may decrease inflammation and warrants further exploration as a potential strategy to improve gut  and decrease systemic inflammation among persons receiving prolonged suppressive ART.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635305>AMPK Activation Promotes Tight Junction Assembly in Intestinal Epithelial Caco- Cells.</a></h2><p>The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is principally known as a major regulator of cellular energy status, but it has been recently shown to play a key structural role in cell-cell junctions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of AMPK activation on the reassembly of tight junctions in intestinal epithelial Caco- cells. We generated Caco- cells invalidated for AMPK Î±1/Î± (AMPK dKO) by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and evaluated the effect of the direct AMPK activator 991 on the reassembly of tight junctions following a calcium switch assay. We analyzed the  of the epithelial  by measuring the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), the paracellular permeability, and quantification of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) deposit at plasma membrane by immunofluorescence. Here, we demonstrated that AMPK deletion induced a delay in tight junction reassembly and relocalization at the plasma membrane during calcium switch, leading to impairments in the establishment of TEER and paracellular permeability. We also showed that 991-induced AMPK activation accelerated the reassembly and reorganization of tight junctions, improved the development of TEER and paracellular permeability after calcium switch. Thus, our results show that AMPK activation ensures a better recovery of epithelial  function following injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561505>A Dual Protective Effect of Intestinal Remote Ischemic Conditioning in a Rat Model of Total Hepatic Ischemia.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to investigate the effects of intestinal remote ischemic preconditioning (iRIC) on ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and gut   in a rat model of total hepatic ischemia (THI). Male Wistar rats ( = 50; 250-300 g) were randomly allocated into two experimental groups: RIC/Control. Thirty minutes of THI was induced by clamping the hepatoduodenal ligament. iRIC was applied as 4-min of ischemia followed by 11-min of reperfusion by clamping the superior mesenteric artery. Animals were sacrificed at 1, , 6, 24 h post-reperfusion ( = 5/group/timepoint). RIC of the gut significantly improved microcirculation of the ileum and the liver. Tissue ATP-levels were higher following iRIC (Liver: 1.34 Â± 0.12 vs. 0.97 Â± 0.20 Î¼mol/g,  = 0.04) and hepatocellular injury was reduced significantly (ALT: 2409 Â± 447 vs. 6613 Â± 1117 IU/L,  = 0.003). Systemic- and portal venous IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels were markedly lower following iRIC, demonstrating a reduced inflammatory response. iRIC led to a structural and functional preservation of the intestinal . These results suggest that iRIC might confer a potent protection against the detrimental effects of THI in rats via reducing IRI and systemic inflammatory responses and at the same time by mitigating the dramatic consequences of severe intestinal congestion and bacterial translocation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31478134>Anfibatide Preserves Blood-Brain   by Inhibiting TLR4/RhoA/ROCK Pathway After Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Rat.</a></h2><p>The disruption of the blood-brain  (BBB) and the consequent brain edema are major contributors to the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. RhoA is generally thought to play a crucial role in the process of BBB disruption and participate in the signaling pathways emanating from TLR4. However, it remains unverified the regulatory role of TLR4 in the RhoA/ROCK pathway in cerebral I/R injury and its effects on the BBB as well. The present study probes into the protective effect of ANF on the BBB after cerebral I/R injury and the possible mechanisms. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by 120Â min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). ANF (1, , 4Â Î¼g/kg) was achieved by intravenous injection after 120Â min of MCAO followed by 1, 24, 48, and 72Â h reperfusion. Evans blue extravasation, brain water content, RhoA activity, and the expressions of TLR4, ROCK1/, p-MLC2, MMP-/9, ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 protein in rat brain were evaluated 72Â h after reperfusion. ANF could significantly reduce the Evans blue extravasation and water content in the ipsilateral hemisphere and obviously increase the occludin, claudin-5, and ZO-1 expression after cerebral I/R injury. Furthermore, cerebral I/R injury induced apparently increased expression of TLR4, RhoA-GTP, ROCK1/, p-MLC2, and MMMP-/9, which, however, could be remarkably alleviated by ANF intervention. Taken together, the TLR4/RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway is implicated in BBB breakdown after cerebral I/R injury, and ANF preserves BBB , probably via inhibiting the TLR4/RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481750>Small heat shock protein CRYAB inhibits intestinal mucosal inflammatory responses and protects   through suppressing IKKÎ² activity.</a></h2><p>Alpha B-crystallin (CRYAB) is an important member of the small heat shock protein family, and plays a protective and therapeutic role in neurological inflammation. CRYAB expression was assessed in cultured HT29 and Caco- cells and inflamed mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colitis models in mice. Lentivirus-overexpressing and CRSIPR/Cas9 systems were used in different cells to upregulate and silence CRYAB expression, respectively. Cell permeable recombined fusion protein TAT-CRYAB was injected intraperitoneally into dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- or ,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice to assess its anti-inflammatory effects. CRYAB was found to be significantly decreased in the inflamed mucosa from IBD patients and DSS-induced colitis in mice, and negatively correlated with the levels of TNF-Î± and IL-6, respectively. Enforced expression of CRYAB suppressed expression of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-1Î², and IL-8) via inhibiting the IKK complex formation, whereas lack of CRYAB expression markedly enhanced proinflammatory responses. Consistently, administration of TAT-CRYAB fusion protein significantly alleviated DSS- or TNBS-induced colitis in mice and protected intestinal  . CRYAB regulates inflammatory response in intestinal mucosa by inhibiting IKKÎ²-mediated signaling and may serve as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055735>Chronic Kidney Disease Increases Cerebral Microbleeds in Mouse and Man.</a></h2><p>Brain microbleeds are increased in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and their presence increases risk of cognitive decline and stroke. We examined the interaction between CKD and brain microhemorrhages (the neuropathological substrate of microbleeds) in mouse and cell culture models and studied progression of microbleed burden on serial brain imaging from humans. Mouse studies: Two CKD models were investigated: adenine-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis and surgical 5/6 nephrectomy. Cell culture studies: bEnd.3 mouse brain endothelial cells were grown to confluence, and monolayer  was measured after exposure to 5-15% human uremic serum or increasing concentrations of urea. Human studies: Progression of brain microbleeds was evaluated on serial MRI from control, pre-dialysis CKD, and dialysis patients. Microhemorrhages were increased -.5-fold in mice with CKD independent of higher blood pressure in the 5/6 nephrectomy model. IgG staining was increased in CKD animals, consistent with increased blood-brain  permeability. Incubation of bEnd.3 cells with uremic serum or elevated urea produced a dose-dependent drop in trans-endothelial electrical resistance. Elevated urea induced actin cytoskeleton derangements and decreased claudin-5 expression. In human subjects, prevalence of microbleeds was 50% in both CKD cohorts compared with 10% in age-matched controls. More patients in the dialysis cohort had increased microbleeds on follow-up MRI after 1.5Â years. CKD disrupts the blood-brain  and increases brain microhemorrhages in mice and microbleeds in humans. Elevated urea alters the actin cytoskeleton and tight junction proteins in cultured endothelial cells, suggesting that these mechanisms explain (at least in part) the microhemorrhages and microbleeds observed in the animal and human studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415870>The role of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors on retinal pigment epithelial cells  function and angiogenic effects.</a></h2><p>Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a lysophospholipid mediator, promoting angiogenesis and inflammation via interactions with its receptors (S1P1-5), but the receptors and signaling pathways responsible for the progression of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) remain unknown. We investigated the roles of S1P/S1P receptors in RPE cells. ARPE-19 cells were treated with S1P dissolved in carrier proteins of albumin or apolipoprotein M (ApoM). The mRNA expression levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8), C-C motif chemokine ligand  (CCL2), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The protein level of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1Î± was assessed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HIF transcriptional activity was evaluated with a dual-reporter luciferase assay. Cellular   was evaluated using transepithelial electrical resistance and the FITC-dextran permeability assay. The suppressive effect of an S1P antagonist on CNV progression was investigated with a laser-induced CNV model in mice. The increase in expression of IL-8, CCL2, and VEGF due to albumin-bound S1P was significantly mitigated by an S1P2 antagonist. The expression of HIF-1Î± significantly decreased with inhibition of S1P2 and S1P3. In addition, albumin-bound S1P disrupted the   of retinal pigment epithelial cells via S1P2, whereas  was strengthened by ApoM-bound S1P. CNV lesions were significantly reduced in the mouse model with intravitreal injection of S1P2 antagonist. This study demonstrated that S1P significantly promotes angiogenesis, inflammation, and  , which was attenuated by inhibition of S1P2 or S1P3, suggesting that regulation of S1P2 and S1P3 is a novel therapeutic target for CNV.Copyright Â© 2019.

To investigate the contributions of the corneal and limbal epithelia in angiogenic and lymphangiogenic privilege, we designed five injury models involving debridement of different portions of the cornea and limbus and applied them to the dual-fluorescence reporter Prox1-GFP/Flt1-DsRed mouse, which permits in vivo imaging of blood and lymphatic vessels via fluorescence microscopy. Debridement of the whole cornea resulted in significant hemangiogenesis (HA) and lymphangiogenesis (LA), while that of the whole limbus yielded minimal corneal HA or LA. Following hemilimbal plus whole corneal debridement, corneal NV occurred only through the non-injured aspect of the limbus. Overall, these results suggest that the integrity of the corneal epithelium is important for (lymph)angiogenic privilege, whereas the limbus does not act as a physical or physiologic  to invading vessels. In CDh5-CreERT2VEGFR2lox/PGFD mice, conditional deletion of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  in vascular endothelial cells abolished injury-induced HA and LA, demonstrating the utility of this transgenic mouse line for identifying important factors in the process of neovascularization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557883>Toxicological Assessment of ITER-Like Tungsten Nanoparticles Using an In Vitro 3D Human Airway Epithelium Model.</a></h2><p>The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is an international project aimed at the production of carbon-free energy through the use of thermonuclear fusion. During ITER operation, in case of a loss-of-vacuum-accident, tungsten nanoparticles (W-NPs) could potentially be released into the environment and induce occupational exposure via inhalation. W-NPs toxicity was evaluated on MucilAirâ¢, a 3D in vitro cell model of the human airway epithelium. MucilAirâ¢ was exposed for 24 h to metallic ITER-like milled W-NPs, tungstate (WO) and tungsten carbide cobalt particles alloy (WC-Co). Cytotoxicity and its reversibility were assessed using a kinetic mode up to 28 days after exposure. Epithelial tightness, metabolic activity and interleukin-8 release were also evaluated. Electron microscopy was performed to determine any morphological modification, while mass spectrometry allowed the quantification of W-NPs internalization and of W transfer through the MucilAirâ¢. Our results underlined a decrease in  , no effect on metabolic activity or cell viability and a transient increase in IL-8 secretion after exposure to ITER-like milled W-NPs. These effects were associated with W-transfer through the epithelium, but not with intracellular accumulation. We have shown that, under our experimental conditions, ITER-like milled W-NPs have a minor impact on the MucilAirâ¢ in vitro model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545471>Highâfat treatment prevents postoperative cognitive dysfunction in a hyperlipidemia model by protecting the bloodâbrain  via Mfsd2aârelated signaling.</a></h2><p>Damage to the bloodâbrain  (BBB) resulting from systemic inflammation caused by surgical trauma is associated with cognitive dysfunction, and individuals with hyperlipidemia are more sensitive to such impairment. The present study was designed to ascertain whether dexmedetomidineÂ (Dex) treatment could reduce the incidence of cognitive dysfunction following surgery in a hyperlipidemia model. Hyperlipidemia was induced in SpragueâDawley rats (male, 6â7Â months old) by consuming a highâfat diet, and rats were divided into three groups (n=10 each) and underwent: exploratory laparotomy to introduce surgical trauma (surgery group), laparotomy and Dex treatment (surgery+Dex group), or sham surgery (sham group). Learning, memory and exploration behavior were assessed using the Morris water maze. Concentrations of tumor necrosis factorÂ (TNF)âÎ± and interleukin (IL)â1Î², were determined by enzymeâlinked immunosorbent assay. BBB permeability was assessed by Evans blue staining. Relative major facilitator superfamily domainâcontaining protein  (Mfsd2a) mRNA expression was determined by quantitative PCR. In the Morris water maze test, the time and distance ratio for the surgery group was significantly lower than those of the sham and surgery+Dex groups (P<0.05). In addition, the TNFâÎ± concentrations in the sham and surgery+Dex groups were lower than that in the surgery group (P<0.05 on daysÂ 1 and 3). Evans Blue staining was increased in the surgery group on dayÂ 1 (P<0.01). Mfsd2a mRNA expression was higher in the sham and surgery+Dex groups compared with that noted in the surgery group (P<0.05). In conclusion, Dex treatment decreased the incidence of cognitive dysfunction following surgical trauma in a hyperlipidemia rat model.

Dysbiosis or liver disorders lead to0 epithelial  dysfunction, altering membrane permeability to toxins. Clinical and experimental evidence shows that the permeability hence the delivery of neurotoxins such as LPS, ammonia and salsolinol contribute to neurological disorders.

In light of emerging studies on the potential role of gut microbiota in neurological disorders, we sought to understand the causal association between CUD and gut dysbiosis. Using a comprehensive approach, we confirmed that cocaine administration in mice resulted in alterations of the gut microbiota. Furthermore, cocaine-mediated gut dysbiosis was associated with upregulation of proinflammatory mediators including NF-ÎºB and IL-1Î². In vivo and in vitro analyses confirmed that cocaine altered gut- composition of the tight junction proteins while also impairing epithelial permeability by potentially involving the MAPK/ERK1/ signaling.

Platelets have long been recognized as the cellular orchestrators of primary haemostasis. Recent studies have demonstrated further that platelets are required for supporting intact mature blood vessels and play a crucial role in maintaining vascular  during inflammation. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether platelets could reduce tPA-induced deterioration of cerebrovascular  and lead to less hemorrhagic transformation.Mice were subjected to models of collagenase-induced intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. After  h of MCA occlusion, tPA (10 mg/kg) was administered as an intravenous bolus injection of 1 mg/kg followed by a 9 mg/kg infusion for 30 min. Immediately after tPA treatment, mice were transfused with platelets. Hemorrhagic volume, infarct size, neurological deficit, tight junction and basal membrane damages, endothelial cell apoptosis, and extravascular accumulation of circulating dextran and IgG, and Evans blue were quantified at 24 h.Platelet transfusion resulted in a significant decrease in hematoma volume after ICH. In mice after ischemia, tPA administration increased brain hemorrhage transformation and this was reversed by resting but not activated platelets. Consistent with this, we observed that tPA-induced brain hemorrhage was dramatically exacerbated in thrombocytopenic mice. Transfusion of resting platelets ameliorated tPA-induced loss of cerebrovascular  and reduced extravascular accumulation of circulating serum proteins and Evans blue, associated with improved neurological functions after ischemia. No changes were found for infarct volume. Inhibition of platelet receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) blunted the ability of platelets to attenuate tPA-induced BBB disruption and hemorrhage after ischemia.Our findings demonstrate the importance of platelets in safeguarding BBB  and suggest that transfusion of resting platelets may be useful to improve the safety of tPA thrombolysis in ischemic stroke.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637713>Podosome formation impairs endothelial  function by sequestering zonula occludens proteins.</a></h2><p>Podosomes and tight junctions (TJs) are subcellular compartments that both exist in endothelial cells and localize at cell surfaces. In contrast to the well-characterized role of TJs in maintaining cerebrovascular , the specific function of endothelial podosomes remains unknown. Intriguingly, we discovered cross-talk between podosomes and TJs in human brain endothelial cells. Tight junction scaffold proteins ZO-1 and ZO- localize at podosomes in response to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate treatment. We found that both ZO proteins are essential for podosome formation and function. Rather than being derived from new protein synthesis, podosomal ZO-1 and ZO- are relocated from a pre-existing pool found at the peripheral plasma membrane with enhanced physical interaction with cortactin, a known protein marker for podosomes. Sequestration of ZO proteins in podosomes weakens tight junction complex formation, leading to increased endothelial cell permeability. This effect can be further attenuated by podosome inhibitor PP2. Altogether, our data revealed a novel cellular function of podosomes, specifically, their ability to negatively regulate tight junction and endothelial  , which have been linked to a variety of cerebrovascular diseases.Â© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31006408>The involvement of NF-B/P38 pathways in  extracts attenuating of  K88-induced acute intestinal injury in weaned piglets.</a></h2><p>The present study was carried out to evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation of Scutellaria baicalensis extracts (SBE) on intestinal health in terms of morphology,   and immune responses in weaned piglets challenged with Escherichia coli K88. A total of seventy-two weaned piglets were assigned into two groups to receive a basal diet without including antibiotic additives or the basal diet supplemented 1000 mg SBE/kg diet for 14 d. On day 15, twelve healthy piglets from each group were selected to expose to oral administration of either 10 ml 1 Ã 109 colony-forming units of E. coli K88 or the vehicle control. After 48 h of E.coli K88 challenge, blood was sampled, and then all piglets were killed humanely for harvesting jejunal and ileal samples. Dietary supplementation of SBE significantly decreased diarrhoea frequency and improved feed conversion ratio (P < 0Â·05). SBE supplementation to E.coli K88-challenged piglets improved villous height and villous height/crypt depth (P < 0Â·05), recovered the protein expression of occludin and zonula occludens- in both the jejunum and ileum (P < 0Â·05), and mitigated the increases in plasma IL-1Î², TNF-Î±, IL-6, IgA and IgG (P < 0Â·05). Meanwhile, dietary SBE effectively inhibited the stimulation of NF-ÎºB, P38 and TNF-Î± as well as IL-1Î² in the small intestine of piglets challenged by E. coli K88 and prevented the activation of NF-ÎºB/P38 signalling pathways (P < 0Â·05).

The VDR is activated by 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and plays an important role in maintaining  of the intestinal mucosal . LCA can also substitute for vitamin D to carry out the in vivo functions of vitamin D. However, it is unclear whether activation of the VDR by LCA affects mucosal  function. In the present study, we researched the protective effect of LCA on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±)-induced intestinal epithelial  dysfunction in Caco- cells of the human epithelial intestinal adenocarcinoma cell line. Caco- cell monolayers were pretreated with LCA and then exposed to 100â¯ng/mL TNF-Î±. The results showed that LCA alleviated the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in FITC-Dextran flux induced by TNF-Î±. LCA ameliorated the TNF-Î±-induced decrease in protein expression and distribution of ZO-1, E-cadherin, Occludin, and Claudin-1, which are tight junction markers. Additionally, the LCA treatment effectively counteracted TNF-Î±-mediated downregulation of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor  (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1, which are related to oxidative stress. Increases in NF-ÎºB p-p65 and p-IÎºB-Î± induced by TNF-Î± were significantly inhibited by LCA. Considering all these, the present study indicates that LCA has a significant protective effect on TNF-Î±-induced injury of intestinal  function through the VDR and suggests that suppressing NF-ÎºB signaling and activating the SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway might be one of the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of LCA.Copyright Â© 2019.

The aim of this study is to demonstrate the relevance of carrier selection and sunscreen photostability when designing sunscreen formulations to protect the biomechanical  properties of human stratum corneum (SC) from solar ultraviolet (UV) damage. Biomechanical properties of SC samples were assayed after accelerated UVB damage through measurements of the SC's mechanical stress profile and corneocyte cohesion. A narrowband UVB (305-315â¯nm) lamp was used to expose SC samples to 5, 30, 125, and 265â¯Jâ¯cm in order to magnify damage to the mechanical properties of the tissue and characterize the UV degradation dose response such that effects from smaller UV dosages can be extrapolated. Stresses in the SC decreased when treated with sunscreen components, highlighting their effect on the skin prior to UV exposure. Stresses increased with UVB exposure and in specimens treated with different sunscreens stresses varied dramatically at high UVB dosages. Specimens treated with sunscreen components without UVB exposure exhibited altered corneocyte cohesion. Both sunscreens studied prevented alteration of corneocyte cohesion by low UVB dosages, but differences in protection were observed at higher UVB dosages indicating UV degradation of one sunscreen. These results indicate the protection of individual sunscreen components vary over a range of UVB dosages, and components can even cause alteration of the biomechanical  properties of human SC before UV exposure. Therefore, detailed characterization of sunscreen formulation components is required to design robust protection from UV damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308073>Glomerular Function and Structural  Depend on Hyaluronan Synthesis by Glomerular Endothelium.</a></h2><p>A glycocalyx envelope consisting of proteoglycans and adhering proteins covers endothelial cells, both the luminal and abluminal surface. We previously demonstrated that short-term loss of  of the luminal glycocalyx layer resulted in perturbed glomerular filtration  function.To explore the role of the glycocalyx layer of the endothelial extracellular matrix in renal function, we generated mice with an endothelium-specific and inducible deletion of hyaluronan synthase  (Has2), the enzyme that produces hyaluronan, the main structural component of the endothelial glycocalyx layer. We also investigated the presence of endothelial hyaluronan in human kidney tissue from patients with varying degrees of diabetic nephropathy.Endothelial deletion of Has2 in adult mice led to substantial loss of the glycocalyx structure, and analysis of their kidneys and kidney function showed vascular destabilization, characterized by mesangiolysis, capillary ballooning, and albuminuria. This process develops over time into glomerular capillary rarefaction and glomerulosclerosis, recapitulating the phenotype of progressive human diabetic nephropathy. Using a hyaluronan-specific probe, we found loss of glomerular endothelial hyaluronan in association with lesion formation in tissue from patients with diabetic nephropathy. We also demonstrated that loss of hyaluronan, which harbors a specific binding site for angiopoietin and a key regulator of endothelial quiescence and maintenance of EC  function results in disturbed angiopoietin 1 Tie2.Endothelial loss of hyaluronan results in disturbed glomerular endothelial stabilization. Glomerular endothelial hyaluronan is a previously unrecognized key component of the extracelluar matrix that is required for glomerular structure and function and lost in diabetic nephropathy.Copyright Â© 2019 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31164887>Dysregulation of Intestinal Epithelial Cell RIPK Pathways Promotes Chronic Inflammation in the IBD Gut.</a></h2><p>Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are common intestinal bowel diseases (IBD) characterized by intestinal epithelial injury including extensive epithelial cell death, mucosal erosion, ulceration, and crypt abscess formation. Several factors including activated signaling pathways, microbial dysbiosis, and immune deregulation contribute to disease progression. Although most research efforts to date have focused on immune cells, it is becoming increasingly clear that intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) are important players in IBD pathogenesis. Aberrant or exacerbated responses to how IEC sense IBD-associated microbes, respond to TNF stimulation, and regenerate and heal the injured mucosa are critical to the  of the intestinal . The role of several genes and pathways in which single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) showed strong association with IBD has recently been studied in the context of IEC. In patients with IBD, it has been shown that the expression of specific dysregulated genes in IECs plays an important role in TNF-induced cell death and microbial sensing. Among them, the NF-ÎºB pathway and its target gene TNFAIP3 promote TNF-induced and receptor interacting protein kinase (RIPK1)-dependent intestinal epithelial cell death. On the other hand, RIPK2 functions as a key signaling protein in host defense responses induced by activation of the cytosolic microbial sensors nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing proteins 1 and  (NOD1 and NOD2). The RIPK2-mediated signaling pathway leads to the activation of NF-ÎºB and MAP kinases that induce autophagy following infection.

Smoking is a strong environmental risk factor for the common oral inflammatory disease periodontitis and oral cancer. Cigarette smoke affects gene methylation and expression in various tissues. This is the first epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) that aimed to identify biologically active methylation marks of the oral masticatory mucosa that are associated with smoking.Ex vivo biopsies of 18 current smokers and 21 never smokers were analysed with the Infinium Methylation EPICBeadChip and combined with whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq; 16 mio reads per sample) of the same samples. We analysed the associations of CpG methylation values with cigarette smoking and smoke pack year (SPY) levels in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Nine CpGs were significantly associated with smoking status, with three CpGs mapping to the genetic region of CYP1B1 (cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B member 1;Â best pâ=â5.5âÃâ10) and two mapping to AHRR (aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor; best pâ=â5.9âÃâ10). In the SPY analysis, 61 CpG sites at 52 loci showed significant associations of the quantity of smoking with changes in methylation values. Here, the most significant association located to the gene CYP1B1, with pâ=â4.0âÃâ10. RNA-Seq data showed significantly increased expression of CYP1B1 in smokers compared to non-smokers (pâ=â.âÃâ10), together with 13 significantly upregulated transcripts. Six transcripts were significantly downregulated. No differential expression was observed for AHRR. In vitro studies with gingival fibroblasts showed that cigarette smoke extract directly upregulated the expression of CYP1B1.This study validated the established role of CYP1B1 and AHRR in xenobiotic metabolism of tobacco smoke and highlights the importance of epigenetic regulation for these genes. For the first time, we give evidence of this role for the oral masticatory mucosa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315208>Amelioration of Enterotoxigenic -Induced Intestinal  Disruption by Low-Molecular-Weight Chitosan in Weaned Pigs is Related to Suppressed Intestinal Inflammation and Apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Enterotoxigenic  (ETEC) infection destroys the intestinal  , in turn, disrupting intestinal homoeostasis. Low-molecular-weight chitosan (LMWC) is a water-soluble chitosan derivative with versatile biological properties. Herein, we examined whether LMWC could relieve ETEC-induced intestinal  damage in weaned pigs. Twenty-four weaned pigs were allotted to three treatments: (1) non-infected control; () ETEC-infected control; and (3) ETEC infection + LMWC supplementation (100 mg/kg). On day 12, pigs in the infected groups were administered 100 mL of ETEC at .6 Ã 10 colony-forming units/mL to induce intestinal  injury. Three days later, serum samples were obtained from all pigs, which were then slaughtered to collect intestinal samples. We evidenced that LMWC not only increased ( < 0.05) the occludin protein abundance but also decreased ( < 0.05) the interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-Î± and mast cell tryptase contents, and the apoptotic epithelial cell percentages, in the small intestine of ETEC-infected pigs. Furthermore, LMWC down-regulated ( < 0.05) the small intestinal expression levels of critical inflammatory- and apoptotic-related genes, such as Toll-like receptor 4 () and tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (), as well as the intra-nuclear nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) p65 protein abundance, in the ETEC-infected pigs. Our study indicated a protective effect of LMWC on ETEC-triggered intestinal  disruption in weaned pigs, which involves the repression of intestinal inflammatory responses via blocking the TLR4/NF-ÎºB signalling pathway and the depression of epithelial cell death via TNFR1-dependent apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176726>Potentiating a non-neuronal cardiac cholinergic system reinforces the functional  of the blood brain  associated with systemic anti-inflammatory responses.</a></h2><p>We previously reported that the heart-specific choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) gene overexpressing mice (ChAT tg) show specific phenotypes including ischemic tolerance and the CNS stress tolerance. In the current study, we focused on molecular mechanisms responsible for systemic and localized anti-inflammatory phenotypes of ChAT tg. ChAT tg were resistant to systemic inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharides due to an attenuated cytokine response. In addition, ChAT tg, originally equipped with less reactive Kupffer cells, were refractory to brain cold injury, with decreased blood brain  (BBB) permeability and reduced inflammation. This is because ChAT tg brain endothelial cells expressed more claudin-5, and their astrocytes were less reactive, causing decreased hypertrophy. Moreover, reconstruction of the BBB  in vitro confirmed the consolidation of ChAT tg. ChAT tg were also resistant to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) neuronal toxicity due to lower mortality rate and neuronal loss of substantia nigra. Additionally, ChAT tg subjected to MPTP showed attenuated BBB disruption, as evident from reduced sodium fluorescein levels in the brain parenchyma. The activated central cholinergic pathway of ChAT tg lead to anti-convulsive effects like vagus nerve stimulation. However, DSP-4, a noradrenergic neuron-selective neurotoxin against the CNS including the locus ceruleus, abrogated the beneficial phenotype and vagotomy attenuated expression of claudin-5, suggesting the link between the cholinergic pathway and BBB function. Altogether, these findings indicate that ChAT tg possess an anti-inflammatory response potential, associated with upregulated claudin-5, leading to the consolidation of BBB . These characteristics protect ChAT tg against systemic and localized inflammatory pathological disorders, which targets the CNS.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Tight junctions (TJs) are essential to maintain intestinal . L-Arginine has beneficial effects on gut functions. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that L-arginine regulates the TJ network by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, which in turn improves intestinal  functions under HS. IEC-6 cells and rat small intestines were used as experiment models of heat stress. AICAR and dorsomorphin were used to activate and inhibit the AMPK pathway, respectively. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, differential gene expression and KEGG pathway analysis, intestinal paracellular permeability, intestinal morphology, and expression of HSP and TJ proteins, and p-AMPK were determined. L-Arginine promoted cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis after heat exposure at an optimal concentration of 5Â mmol. Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes associated with the HSP family and TJs were elevated by L-arginine. According to KEGG pathway analysis, L-arginine activated the AMPK signaling pathway. In vivo, intestinal damage resulted in obvious morphological changes as well as apoptosis with TUNEL and caspase-3 staining under HS and dorsomorphin treatments. Furthermore, HS and dorsomorphin increased the serum D-lactate concentration, diamine oxidase activity, and mRNA expression level of MLCK (Pâ<â0.05). In contrast, L-arginine and AICAR treatments reduced intestinal injury, maintained intestinal permeability, and increased the villus/crypt ratio under hyperthermia. L-Arginine had the same effect as AICAR both in vitro and in vivo, namely increasing p-AMPK protein expression. L-Arginine and AICAR also upregulated the mRNA expression level of HSP70 and HSP90, and downregulated mRNA expression of MLCK (Pâ<â0.05). The protein expression levels of TJ proteins ZO-1 and claudin-1 were suppressed by heat stroke and dorsomorphin, but enhanced by L-arginine and AICAR. Our findings indicate that activation of AMPK signaling by L-arginine is associated with improved intestinal mucosal  functions by enhancing the expression of TJs in rat small intestines and IEC-6 cells during HS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161702>Effects of Lactococcus lactis MG1363 producing fusion proteins of bovine lactoferricin-lactoferrampin on growth, intestinal morphology and immune function in weaned piglet.</a></h2><p>We developed a strategy for localized delivery of the LFCA (lactoferricinlactoferrampin), which is actively synthesized in situ by Lactococcus lactis (pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363), and explored the possibility of using pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 as an alternative additive diet to antibiotics.The antimicrobial activities of the LFCA derived from pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 were tested in vitro. The results showed that LFCA had an inhibitory effect on Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis. Then, the pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 was used as an additive diet for piglets. Our data demonstrated that oral administration of pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 significantly improved the average daily gain, feed-to-gain ratio, intestinal mucosal  and decreased the serum endotoxin and d-lactic acid levels. The mRNA expression levels of intestinal tight junction proteins (including occludin, Claudin-1 and ZO-1) were significantly upregulated by pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 administration. The serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, intestinal secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) levels, IL-, IL-10 and TGF-Î² levels were significantly increased by pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363. Furthermore, our data revealed that oral administration of pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 significantly increased the number of general Lactobacillus, and decreased the total viable E. coli counts in the ileum and cecum contents.We developed a novel pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 secreting LFCA, which had probiotic effects on the growth performance, intestinal morphology, intestinal  function and immunological indices of weaned piglets.pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363, with probiotic effects on the health of weaned piglets, may be a promising feed additive for weaned piglets.Â© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040055>Epstein-Barr Virus dUTPase Induces Neuroinflammatory Mediators: Implications for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.</a></h2><p>Neuroinflammation is a common feature in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), affecting 85%-90% of all patients, yet the underlying mechanism or mechanisms responsible for the initiation and/or promotion of this process is largely unknown. Multiple reports, however, have suggested a role for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), in particular, in ME/CFS, but its potential role, if any, in the neuroinflammatory process has not been addressed. In support of this premise, studies by our group have found that the EBV protein deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) induces anxiety and sickness behaviors in female mice. We also found that a small subset of patients with ME/CFS exhibited prolonged and significantly elevated neutralizing antibodies against EBV dUTPase protein in serum, which inversely correlated with ME/CFS symptoms. A larger ME/CFS case-control cohort study further confirmed that a significant percentage of patients with ME/CFS (30.91%-52.7%) were simultaneously producing antibodies against multiple human herpesviruses-encoded dUTPases and/or human dUTPase. Altogether, these findings suggest that EBV dUTPase protein may be involved in the neuroinflammatory process observed in ME/CFS. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the EBV dUTPase protein could contribute to neuroinflammation by altering the expression ofÂ genes involved with maintaining blood-brain  (BBB)  and/or modulating synaptic plasticity.With the use of human immortalized astrocytes, microglia, and cerebral microvascular endothelial cells, we conducted time-course (0-24Â h) experiments with EBV dUTPase protein (10Â Î¼g/mL) to determine what effect(s) it may have on the expression of genes involved with BBB permeability, astrocytes and microglia cell function, tryptophan metabolism, and synaptic plasticity by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In parallel, inÂ vivo studies were conducted in female C57Bl/6 mice. Mice were injected by the intraperitoneal route with EBV dUTPase protein (10Â Î¼g) or vehicle daily for 5 days, and the brains were collected and processed for further qRT-PCR analysis of the inÂ vivo effect of the dUTPase on the dopamine/serotonin and Î³-aminobutyric acid/glutamate pathways, which are important for brain function, using RT Profiler PCR Arrays.EBV dUTPase protein altered the expression inÂ vitro (12 of 15 genes and 32 of 1000 proteins examined) and inÂ vivo (34 of 84 genes examined) of targets with central roles in BBB /function, fatigue, pain synapse structure, and function, as well as tryptophan, dopamine, and serotonin metabolism.The data suggest that in a subset of patients with ME/CFS, the EBV dUTPase could initiate a neuroinflammatory reaction, which contributes to the fatigue, excessive pain, and cognitive impairments observed in these patients.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The ECM provides a porous substrate critical for nutrient exchange and cellular adhesion. The enterocytes within the epithelial monolayer possess proteins such as transporters, carriers, pumps and channels that participate in the movement of drugs, metabolites, ions and amino acids and whose function can be regulated or altered by the properties of the ECM. Here, we characterized expression and function of proteins involved in transport across the human small intestinal epithelium grown on two different culture platforms. One strategy employs a conventional scaffolding method comprised of a thin ECM film overlaying a porous membrane while the other utilizes a thick ECM hydrogel placed on a porous membrane. The thick hydrogel possesses a gradient of chemical cross-linking along its length to provide a softer substrate than that of the ECM film-coated membrane while maintaining mechanical stability.The monolayers on both platforms possessed goblet cells and abundant enterocytes and were impermeable to Lucifer yellow and fluorescein-dextran (70 kD) indicating high  . Multiple transporter proteins were present in both primary-cell culture formats at levels similar to those present in freshly isolated crypts/villi; however, expression of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug resistance protein  (MRP2) in the monolayers on the conventional scaffold was substantially less than that on the gradient cross-linked scaffold and freshly isolated crypts/villi.

Evidence suggests that stimulation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family of PRR may regulate epithelial   by upregulating tight junction (TJ) complex protein expression, but it is not known whether this mechanism is utilized in esophageal epithelial cells. TJ complex proteins maintain intact  function and are dysregulated in atopic disorders including eosinophilic esophagitis.Pattern recognition receptors expression was assessed in EoE and control primary esophageal epithelial cells, demonstrating robust expression of TLR2 and TLR3. The three-dimensional air-liquid interface culture (ALI) model was used to test whether TLR2 or TLR3 stimulation alters epithelial  function using an in vitro model of human epithelium. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and FITC-Dextran permeability were evaluated to assess membrane permeability. ALI cultures were evaluated by histology, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP).TLR3 stimulation did not change TEER in the ALI model. TLR2 stimulation increased TEER (1.28- to 1.31-fold) and decreased paracellular permeability to FITC-Dextran, and this effect was abolished by treatment with anti-TLR2 blocking antibody. TJ complex proteins claudin-1 and zonula occludens-1 were upregulated following TLR2 stimulation, and ChIP assay demonstrated altered histone 4 acetyl binding at the TJP1 enhancer and CLDN1 enhancer and promoter following zymosan treatment, implying the occurrence of durable chromatin changes.Our findings implicate the TLR2 pathway as a potential regulator of esophageal epithelial  function and suggest that downstream chromatin modifications are associated with this effect.Â© 2019 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

IL-22 promotes S. aureus and S. pneumoniae host defense in the lung through epithelial  and induction of antimicrobial peptides and is inhibited by the soluble decoy receptor IL-22-binding protein (IL-22BP). Little is known about the effect of the IL-22/IL-22BP regulatory pathway on lung infection, and it has not been studied in the setting of super-infection. We exposed wild-type and IL-22BP mice to influenza A/PR/8/34 for 6 days prior to infection with S. aureus (USA300) S. pneumoniae. Super-infected IL-22BP mice had decreased bacterial burden and improved survival compared to controls. IL-22BP mice exhibited decreased inflammation, increased lipocalin  expression, and deletion of IL-22BP was associated with preserved epithelial  function with evidence of improved tight junction stability. Human bronchial epithelial cells treated with IL-22Fc showed evidence of improved tight junctions compared to untreated cells. This study revealed that IL-22BP mice are protected during influenza, bacterial super-infection, suggesting that IL-22BP has a pro-inflammatory role and impairs epithelial  function likely through interaction with IL-22.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31502457>Heterometallic RuCo [ Ã ] Grid with Localized Single Molecule Magnet Behavior.</a></h2><p>Metal complexes with a [n Ã n] gridlike structure are discussed as attractive building blocks for various materials chemistry applications in molecular nanotechnology and electronics, which often rely on the grids' magnetic and redox properties. Most of the known metallogrids are homometallic, though heterometallic systems that comprise two or more different metals promise higher level functionalities.

In order to prevent scrambling of the different metal ions, a stepwise synthetic approach was implemented in which an inert Ru "corner complex" [(HL)Ru](BF) () was isolated first, followed by addition of the more labile Co. This exclusively yields the desired [LRuCo] with -topology, viz., with the Ru and Co ions situated at opposite corners of the [ Ã ] grid, as confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction.  can be sequentially oxidized four times, first at the Co vertices and then at the Ru vertices.

Various studies reported that forkhead transcription factor (Fox) O1 played a key role in anti-oxidative signaling. This study aimed to investigate the role of Stat1 in high glucose (HG) -induced podocyte injury.Under normal glucose, hypertonic and HG stimulated podocyte conditions, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, flow cytometry and western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were respectively carried out to determine cell viability, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and related genes expressions. We then respectively used silent Stat1, simultaneous silencing Stat1 and FoxO1 and over-expression of FoxO1, to observe whether they/it could reverse the damage of podocytes induced by HG.High glucose attenuated cell survival and promoted cell apoptosis in MPC-5 cells at the same time, and it was also observed to promote the protein expression of Stat1 and the FoxO1 expression inhibition. Silencing Stat1 could reverse HG-induced podocytes injury. Specifically, siStat1 increased cell viability, inhibited cell apoptosis and attenuated ROS level in a high-glucose environment. Cleaved caspase-3 and pro-apoptosis protein Bax was significantly down-regulated, and anti-apoptosis protein Bcl- was up-regulated by siStat1. The antioxidant genes Catalase, MnSOD, NQO1 and HO1 were up-regulated by siStat1. We found that silencing FoxO1 reversed the protective effect of siStat1 on the HG-induced podocytes injury.Silencing Stat1 could reverse the effects of high glucose-triggered low cell viability, cell apoptosis and ROS release and the functions of Stat1 might be involved in FoxO1 mediated-oxidative stress in nucleus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30984353>Anti-inflammatory effect of Lycium barbarum on polarized human intestinal epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) has rapidly escalated in Asia (including Korea) due to increasing westernized diet patterns subsequent to industrialization.

Paracellular permeability was measured to examine the effect of tight junction (TJ) . The regulatory pathways of ER stress were evaluated in MEF knockout (KO) cell lines by qPCR for interleukin (IL) 6, IL8 and XBP1 spliced form (XBP1s). Immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP), XBP1s and CCAAT/enhancer-binding homologous protein (CHOP) expressions were measured by RT-PCR. Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy (SICM) at high resolution was applied to observe morphological changes after treatments.Exposure to LF extract strengthened the TJ, both in the presence and absence of inflammation. In polarized Caco- pretreated with LF, induction in the expression of proinflammatory marker IL8 was not significant, whereas ER stress marker XBP1s expression was significantly increased. In wild type (wt) MEF cells, IL6, CHOP and XBP1 spliced form were dose-dependently induced when exposed to 12.5-50 Âµg/mL extract. However, absence of XBP1 or IRE1Î± in MEF cells abolished this effect.Results of this study show that LF treatment enhances the  function and reduces inflammation and ER stress in an IRE1Î±-XBP1-dependent manner. These results suggest the preventive effect of LF on healthy intestine, and the possibility of reducing the degree of inflammatory symptoms in IBD patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559137>Magnesium Regulates Endothelial  Functions through TRPM7, MagT1, and S1P1.</a></h2><p>Mg-deficiency is linked to hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, migraine headaches, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes, etc., but its exact role in these pathophysiological conditions remains elusive.

The worldwide heterogeneity in CRC incidence is strongly suggestive of etiological involvement of environmental exposures, particularly lifestyle and diet. It is established that physical inactivity, obesity and some dietary factors (red/processed meats, alcohol) are positively associated with CRC, while healthy lifestyle habits show inverse associations. Mechanistic evidence shows that lifestyle and dietary components that contribute to energy excess are linked with increased CRC via metabolic dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, bacterial dysbiosis and breakdown of gut   while the reverse is apparent for components associated with decreased risk.

Type IV collagen is critical for BM function, yet how it is directed into BMs in vivo is unclear. Through live-cell imaging of endogenous localization, conditional knockdown, and misexpression experiments, we uncovered distinct mechanisms of integrin-mediated collagen recruitment to  postembryonic gonadal and pharyngeal BMs. The putative laminin-binding Î±INA-1/Î²PAT-3 integrin was selectively activated in the gonad and recruited laminin, which directed moderate collagen incorporation. In contrast, the putative Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-binding Î±PAT-/Î²PAT-3 integrin was activated in the pharynx and recruited high levels of collagen in an apparently laminin-independent manner. Through an RNAi screen, we further identified the small GTPase RAP-3 (Rap1) as a pharyngeal-specific PAT-/PAT-3 activator that modulates collagen levels. Together, these studies demonstrate that tissues can use distinct mechanisms to direct collagen incorporation into BMs to precisely control collagen levels and construct diverse BMs.Â© 2019 Jayadev et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31257948>Regeneration and Repair of Skin Wounds: Various Strategies for Treatment.</a></h2><p>Skin as a mechanical  between the inner and outer environment of our body protects us against infection and electrolyte loss.

In addition, LL-37/CRAMP fends off microbes and protects against infections in the colon, where the epithelium is exposed to myriad of enteric pathogens. It is increasingly recognized that LL-37/CRAMP maintains colon mucosal  , shapes the composition of microbiota, and protects the host from tumorigenesis. In this review, we discuss the importance of LL-37/CRAMP in the homeostasis of the host, with novel findings derived from mice deficient in CRAMP that support the proposition for this natural antimicrobial peptide and an immune modulator as a drug lead for therapeutic development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31330482>Anthocyanins protect the gastrointestinal tract from high fat diet-induced alterations in redox signaling,   and dysbiosis.</a></h2><p>The gastrointestinal (GI) tract can play a critical role in the development of pathologies associated with overeating, overweight and obesity. We previously observed that supplementation with anthocyanins (AC) (particularly glycosides of cyanidin and delphinidin) mitigated high fat diet (HFD)-induced development of obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and steatosis in C57BL/6J mice. This paper investigated whether these beneficial effects could be related to AC capacity to sustain intestinal monolayer , prevent endotoxemia, and HFD-associated dysbiosis. The involvement of redox-related mechanisms were further investigated in Caco-â¯cell monolayers. Consumption of a HFD for 14 weeks caused intestinal permeabilization and endotoxemia, which were associated with a decreased ileum expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins (occludin, ZO-1 and claudin-1), increased expression of NADPH oxidase (NOX1 and NOX4) and NOS2 and oxidative stress, and activation of redox sensitive signals (NF-ÎºB and ERK1/) that regulate TJ dynamics. AC supplementation mitigated all these events and increased GLP- levels, the intestinal hormone that upregulates TJ protein expression. AC also prevented, in vitro, tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced Caco- monolayer permeabilization, NOX1/4 upregulation, oxidative stress, and NF-ÎºB and ERK activation. HFD-induced obesity in mice caused dysbiosis and affected the levels and secretion of MUC2, a mucin that participates in intestinal cell  protection and immune response. AC supplementation restored microbiota composition and MUC2 levels and distribution in HFD-fed mice. Thus, AC, particularly delphinidin and cyanidin, can preserve GI physiology in HFD-induced obesity in part through redox-regulated mechanisms. This can in part explain AC capacity to mitigate pathologies, i.e. insulin resistance and steatosis, associated with HFD-associated obesity.Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Auditory brainstem response was tested before and 48â¯h after treatments. Distribution of pericytes, PVMs and capillaries was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining, and BLB permeability was estimated by FITC-dextran leakage assay. Ultrastructure of stria vascularis was examined by transmission electron microscope. Protein and mRNA level of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), zona occludens-1 (ZO-1), interleukin-33 (IL-33) and its receptor suppression of tumorigenicity  (ST2) was measured by IHC and qRT-PCR.Unlike pericytes that surround one capillary, PVMs branched to connect with more than one capillary. LPS caused hearing loss in mice. Following LPS challenge, cochleae showed vascular leakage in stria vascularis, and PVMs presented morphological changes including reduced contact with capillaries. TEM revealed a reduced number of tight junction contact points between endothelial cells and a wider space between PVMs, pericytes and endothelial cells. The mRNA and protein levels of MMP-9 and ST2 in stria vascularis were up-regulated, while ZO-1 were down-regulated after exposure to LPS.Our results suggest that PVMs may play a more significant role than pericytes in maintaining the  of BLB. Our findings also reveal a possible mechanism contributing to LPS-induced activation of PVMs, breakdown of BLB and hearing loss.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

S-layer proteins have been confirmed to possess multiple biological properties, but their role in maintaining the intestinal epithelial  is not fully known. We investigated the effects of Slp on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±-elicited intestinal  dysfunction and explored the underlying molecular mechanism. TNF-Î± administration markedly induced intestinal epithelial injury and inflammation in Caco- cells. Preincubation of Caco- cells with Slp at concentrations ranging from 50 to 100â¯Î¼g/mL for 6â¯h improved intestinal epithelial cell  and permeability, restored ZO-1 and Occludin protein expressions (Pâ¯<â¯0.05) and reduced the secretion of interleukin 8 by a maximum of 47.8%. Furthermore, the addition of Slp to Caco- cell monolayers attenuated cell apoptosis and inhibited nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) p65 nucleus translocation by suppressing the activation of NF-ÎºB. Collectively, the ability of Slp to attenuate dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial  stimulated by TNF-Î± and to exert anti-inflammatory effects supports its potential use in the development of functional foods and in the prevention of inflammatory bowel diseases.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

When assessing the effects of ENMs on vascular  function, endothelial cell monolayers are commonly used as in vitro models. Monolayer models, however, do not offer a granular understanding of how the structure-function relationships between endothelial cells and tissues are disrupted due to ENM exposure. To address this issue, we developed a micropatterned endothelial cell pair model to quantitatively evaluate the effects of 10 ENMs (8 metal/metal oxides and  organic ENMs) on multiple cellular parameters and determine how these parameters correlate to changes in vascular  function. This minimalistic approach showed concerted changes in endothelial cell morphology, intercellular junction formation, and cytoskeletal organization due to ENM exposure, which were then quantified and compared to unexposed pairs using a "similarity scoring" method. Using the cell pair model, this study revealed dose-dependent changes in actin organization and adherens junction formation following exposure to representative ENMs (Ag, TiO2 and cellulose nanocrystals), which exhibited trends that correlate with changes in tissue permeability measured using an endothelial monolayer assay. Together, these results demonstrate that we can quantitatively evaluate changes in endothelial architecture emergent from nucleo-cytoskeletal network remodeling using micropatterned cell pairs. The endothelial pair model therefore presents potential applicability as a standardized assay for systematically screening ENMs and other test agents for their cellular-level structural effects on vascular barriers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384532>Aspirin alleviates endothelial gap junction dysfunction through inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in LPS-induced vascular injury.</a></h2><p>The loss of endothelial connective  and endothelial  dysfunction can lead to increased vascular injury, which is related to the activation of endothelial inflammasomes. There are evidences that low concentrations of aspirin can effectively prevent cardiovascular diseases. We hypothesized that low-dose aspirin could ameliorate endothelial injury by inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and ultimately prevent cardiovascular diseases. Microvascular endothelial cells were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (â¯Î¼g/mL) and administrated by 0.1-â¯mmol/L aspirin. The wild type mice were stimulated with LPS (100â¯Î¼g/kg/day), and 1â¯h later treated with aspirin (12.5, 62.5, or 125â¯mg/kg/day) and dexamethasone (0.0182â¯mg/kg/day) for 7 days. Plasma and heart were harvested for measurement of ELISA and immunofluorescence analyses. We found that aspirin could inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation  in dose-dependent manner and has correlation between the NLRP3 inflammasome and the ROS/TXNIP pathway. We also found that low-concentration aspirin could inhibit the formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and restore the expression of the endothelial tight junction protein zonula occludens-1/ (ZO1/). We assume that aspirin can ameliorate the endothelial layer dysfunction by suppressing the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31503404>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii-derived microbial anti-inflammatory molecule regulates intestinal  in diabetes mellitus mice via modulating tight junction protein expression.</a></h2><p>Impaired intestinal  structure and function have been validated as an important pathogenic process in type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Gut dysbiosis is thought to be the critical factor in diabetic intestinal pathogenesis. As the most abundant commensal bacteria, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) play important roles in gut homeostasis. The microbial anti-inflammatory molecule (MAM), an F. prausnitzii metabolite, has anti-inflammatory potential in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Thus, we aimed to explore the function and mechanism of MAM on the diabetic intestinal epithelium.16S high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the gut microbiota of db/db mice (T2DM mouse model). We transfected a FLAG-tagged MAM plasmid into human colonic cells to explore the protein-protein interactions and observe cell monolayer permeability. For in vivo experiments, db/db mice were supplemented with recombinant His-tagged MAM protein from E. coli BL21 (DE3).The abundance of F. prausnitzii was downregulated in the gut microbiota of db/db mice. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and mass spectroscopy (MS) analyses revealed that MAM potentially interacts with proteins in the tight junction pathway, including zona occludens 1 (ZO-1). FLAG-tagged MAM plasmid transfection stabilized the cell permeability and increased ZO-1 expression in NCM460, Caco2, and HT-29 cells. The db/db mice supplemented with recombinant His-tagged MAM protein showed restored intestinal  function and elevated ZO-1 expression.Our study shows that MAM from F. prausnitzii can restore the intestinal  structure and function in DM conditions via the regulation of the tight junction pathway and ZO-1 expression.Â© 2019 The Authors.

Molina pollen causes pollinosis in South America. The aim of this work was to isolate, purify and characterize the proteolytic enzymes of A. caven pollen, and study their influence on allergy. A series of chromatographic steps was applied to purify the proteolytic extract of A. caven pollen. The purified fraction was partially characterized and then, it was assayed on airway bioactive peptides (Substance P, Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide and Bradykinin) and peptide degradation was visualized by direct protein sequencing. The cellular detachment of an airway-derived epithelial cell line (A-549) was measured by methylene blue binding assay. The degradation of proteins from intercellular junctions (Occludin, Claudin and E-cadherin) was visualized by Western blot. A 75-kDa peptidase, named Acaciain peptidase, was purified and classified as a serine peptidase. Acaciain peptidase degraded bioactive peptides involved in the maintenance and recovery of the bronchomotor tone; it caused cellular detachment of A-549 cell line and degradation of intercellular junction proteins. Acaciain peptidase can alter the  of the epithelium , causing cell permeability, increasing the allergic sensitization and exacerbating the overall bronchoconstrictive effect detected in asthmatic lungs.

IBD patients with IBS-like symptoms show higher interleukin-13 (IL-13) serum levels and poor psychological well-being. Supplementary glutamine reduced the daily bowel movement frequency, improved the stool form, and normalized intestinal hyperpermeability. This study was aimed at assessing the effects of IL-13 and supplementary glutamine on human intestinal epithelial function in vitro.Caco- cells were grown on TranswellTM inserts. -IL-13 was added to the basolateral compartment, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled-dextran permeability measured. Effects of glutamine or the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 were assessed. Involvement of tight junction proteins was assessed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining.IL-13 significantly decreased TEER and increased FITC labeled-dextran epithelial permeability. IL-13 stimulation decreased the claudin-1 expression and increased the claudin- expression. Glutamine alleviated IL-13-induced decrease of TEER and increase of FITC labeled-dextran permeability. Further, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor showed this alleviating effect while the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 inhibitor did not.IL-13 induced   impairment by decreasing claudin-1 and increasing claudin-. Glutamine alleviated IL-13-induced  dysfunction by increasing claudin-1 expression, via disruption of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway.Â© 2019 S.

However, serious side effects such as addiction, immunosuppression and gastrointestinal symptoms limit their use. It was recently demonstrated that morphine treatment results in a significant disruption in gut  function, leading to an increased translocation of gut commensal bacteria. Further studies have indicated distinct alterations in the gut microbiome and metabolome following morphine treatment, contributing to the negative consequences that are associated with opioid use. However, it is unclear how opioids modulate gut homeostasis in the context of a hospital-acquired bacterial infection.  is an ideal murine model of human infections with enteropathogenic  (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC). In the current study, a mouse model of  infection was used to investigate the role of morphine in the modulation of gut homeostasis in the context of a hospital-acquired bacterial infection. Morphine treatment resulted in 1) the promotion of  systemic dissemination, ) an increase in the expression of the virulence factors of  colonization in intestinal contents, 3) altered gut microbiome, 4) damaged  of gut epithelial  function, 5) inhibition of the -induced increase in goblet cells, and 6) dysregulated IL-17A immune response. This study demonstrates and further validates a positive correlation between opioid drug use/abuse and an increased risk of infections, suggesting that the overprescription of opioids may increase the susceptibility to hospital-acquired infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620112>Selective Disruption of the Blood-Brain  by Zika Virus.</a></h2><p>The blood-brain  (BBB) selectively regulates the cellular exchange of macromolecules between the circulation and the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we hypothesize that Zika virus (ZIKV) infects the brain via a disrupted BBB and altered expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins, which are structural components of the BBB. To assess this hypothesis,  and  studies were performed using three different strains of ZIKV: Honduras (ZIKV-H), Puerto Rico (ZIKV-PR), and Uganda (ZIKV-U). Primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) were productively infected by all studied ZIKV strains at MOI 0.01, and were analyzed by plaque assay, immunofluorescence for NS1 protein, and qRT-PCR at  and 6 days post-infection (dpi). Compared to mock-infected controls, expression level of ZO-1 was significantly upregulated in ZIKV-H-infected BMECs, while occludin and claudin-5 levels were significantly downregulated in BMECs infected by all three studied viral strains. Interestingly, BMEC permeability was not disturbed by ZIKV infection, even in the presence of a very high viral load (MOI 10). All studied ZIKV strains productively infected wild-type C57BL/J mice after intravenous infection with 10 PFU. Viral load was detected in the plasma, spleen, and brain from 1 to 8 dpi. Peak brain infection was observed at  dpi; therefore, TJ protein expression was assessed at this time point. Claudin-5 was significantly downregulated in ZIKV-U-infected animals and the BBB  was significantly disturbed in ZIKV-H-infected animals. Our results suggest that ZIKV penetrates the brain parenchyma early after infection with concurrent alterations of TJ protein expression and disruption of the BBB permeability in a strain-dependent manner.Copyright Â© 2019 Leda, Bertrand, Andras, El-Hage, Nair and Toborek.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30991758>Real-Time Measurement of Melanoma Cell-Mediated Human Brain Endothelial  Disruption Using Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing Technology.</a></h2><p>Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) is an impedance-based method for monitoring changes in cell behaviour in real-time. In this paper, we highlight the importance of ECIS in measuring the kinetics of human melanoma cell invasion across human brain endothelium. ECIS data can be mathematically modelled to assess which component of the endothelial paracellular and basolateral barriers is being affected and when. Our results reveal that a range of human melanoma cells can mediate disruption of human brain endothelium, primarily involving the paracellular route, as demonstrated by ECIS. The sensitivity of ECIS also reveals that the paracellular  weakens within 30-60 min of the melanoma cells being added to the apical face of the endothelial cells. Imaging reveals pronounced localisation of the melanoma cells at the paracellular junctions consistent with paracellular migration. Time-lapse imaging further reveals junctional opening and disruption of the endothelial monolayer by the invasive melanoma cells all within several hours.

This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of Qingjie Fuzheng Granule (QFG) on 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis in CT-26 tumor-bearing xenograft mice and investigated the possible molecular mechanism.Tumor xenograft models of CT-26 cells were generated in BALB/c nude mice, the mice were randomly divided into 4 groups including control, QFG, 5-FU and 5-FU combined QFG groups. The body weight, volume of tumor and diarrhea score of each group were recorded daily. On the fifth day, the blood of mice was collected, the mice were subsequently euthanized and their thymus, spleen, intestine and tumor were removed for the following analysis.QFG alleviated severe diarrhea and reversed the decrease in the number of white blood cell including granulocyte and lymphocyte induced by 5-FU. QFG could also significantly improve 5-FU-induced several intestinal mucosal damages, and characterized by  villus and crypts, the reduction of necrotic cells. QFG decreased the serum levels of TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and IL-6 and increased the levels of IL-10. Furthermore, QFG inhibited the cellular apoptosis in the jejunum tissue caused by 5-FU via the increasing Bcl- expression and decreasing Bax expression. In addition, QFG promoted the cell proliferation via elevating the expression of Cyclin D1 and CDK4 and reducing p21 expression. Meanwhile, QFG could not further impact on the cell apoptosis and proliferation of tumors caused by 5-FU.QFG attenuated the intestinal mucositis and diarrhea induced by 5-FU via preventive effect on inflammation and its improvement of the intestinal  function, inhibiting cell apoptosis and promoting cell proliferation, and without affecting the 5-FU treatment efficiency. The results suggest that QFG may act as a potential agent against chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis.Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

However, its role in regulating functions of non-malignant cells has been hardly reported. Here, we found Snhg3 expression was sharply induced in primary brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs) treated with oxygen-and-glucose-deprivation (OGD) plus hemin, an in vitro model of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Downregulation of Snhg3 by siRNA transfection improved cell proliferation and migration abilities and reduced cell apoptosis and monolayer permeability in BMVECs under treatment with OGD plus hemin. Snhg3 overexpression suppressed cell proliferation and migration and increased cell apoptosis and monolayer permeability under normal condition. In ICH rats, downregulation of Snhg3 by siRNA injection improved behavioral and histological manifestations, including number of right turns, limb placement score,  of blood-brain  (BBB), brain water content and cell apoptosis in vivo. In the mechanism exploration, we found that, TWEAK and Snhg3 displayed a positive correlation with each other. Snhg3 overexpression increased expression of TWEAK protein and its receptor Fn14, that were also induced by OGD plus hemin, activating the downstream neuroinflammatory pathway STAT3 and enhancing the secretion of MMP-/9. Finally, the TWEAK-siRNA, the Fn14 inhibitor ATA and the STAT3 blocker AG490 were respectively used to treat BMVECs under treatment with OGD plus hemin. Our results showed either TWEAK downregulation, Fn14 inhibition, or STAT3 blockade, could rescue Snhg3-induced impairment of BMVEC functions. In conclusion, the lncRNA Snhg3 contributes to dysfunction of cerebral microvascular cells in ICH rats by activating the TWEAK/Fn14/STAT3 pathway.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The leakage of BBB contributes to the infiltration of peripheral immune cells and harmful mediators into brain parenchyma, even the drugs that can not cross BBB under physiological conditions. Therefore, PD has been regarded as not only a neurodegenerative disease, but also a systemic disorder. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that Dexrazoxane (Dex), a drug clinically used to reduce doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in chemotherapy, can enter into midbrain and striatum through broken BBB in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)- and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced rodent models of PD. Unexpectedly, Dex (1.5, 5, 15â¯mg/kg, i.p.) administration for 3-week significantly ameliorates apomorphine-induced contralateral rotation behavior in 6-OHDA-treated rats and Dex (10â¯mg/kg, i.p.) treatment for 5-week improves MPTP-induced mouse motor dysfunctions. We find that Dex administration protects dopaminergic neurons against neurotoxin-induced degeneration in SNc, accompanied by the attenuated glial cell activation. Further study indicates that suppression of oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, as well as the inhibition of systemic inflammation in both peripheral tissues and brain, contribute to the neuroprotective effects of Dex in PD models. Our study implies that Dex may serve as an effective neuroprotectant to treat neurodegeneration and has potential clinical value in term of PD therapeutics.Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors.

Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) was performed and seizure burden and background aEEG pattern were analysed. BBB disruption was evaluated in the parietal cortex and hippocampus by means of immunohistochemistry and Western blot. mRNA and protein expression of tight-junction proteins (zonula-occludens 1 [ZO1], occludin [OCLN], and claudin-5 [CLDN5]) was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot. In addition, mRNA from genes associated with BBB disruption vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase  (MMP2) as well as inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was assessed with qPCR. Piglets that developed seizures following HI (HI-Sz) had significantly greater injury, as demonstrated by poorer aEEG background pattern scores, lower neurobehavioural scores, and greater histopathology. HI-Sz animals had severe IgG extravasation into brain tissue and uptake into neurons as well as significantly greater levels of IgG in both brain regions as assessed by Western blot. IgG protein in both brain regions was significantly associated with seizure burden, aEEG pattern scores, and neurobehavioural scores. There was no difference in mRNA expression of the tight junctions, however a significant loss of ZO1 and OCLN protein was observed in the parietal cortex. The inflammatory genes TGFÎ², IL1Î², IL8, IL6, and TNFÎ± were significantly upregulated in HI-Sz animals. MMP2 was significantly increased in animals with seizures compared with animals without seizures. Increasing our understanding of neuropathology associated with seizure is vital because of the association between seizure and poor outcomes. Investigating the BBB is a major untapped area of research and a potential avenue for novel treatments.Â© 2019 S.

GHRH also acts as a growth and inflammatory factor in a variety of experimental models in oncology. In the current study, we used bovine pulmonary arterial cells in order to investigate the effects of GHRH and its antagonistic and agonistic analogs in key intracellular pathways that regulate endothelial permeability. GHRH antagonists suppressed the activation of MLC2, ERK1/, JAK2/STAT3 pathway and increased the intracellular P53 and pAMPK levels. In contrast, both GHRH and GHRH agonist MR409 exerted the opposite effects. Furthermore, GHRH antagonists supported the  of endothelial , while GHRH and GHRH agonists had the contrary effects, as reflected in measurements of transendothelial resistance. Our observations support the evidence for the anti - inflammatory role of GHRH antagonists in the vasculature. Moreover, our results suggest that GHRH antagonists should be considered as promising therapeutic agents for treating severe respiratory abnormalities, such as the lethal Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597099>CD109 Restrains Activation of Cutaneous IL-17-Producing Î³Î´ T Cells by Commensal Microbiota.</a></h2><p>Interleukin-17-producing Î³Î´ T (Î³Î´17) cells play a central role in protective and pathogenic immune responses. However, the tissue-specific mechanisms that control the activation of these innate lymphocytes are not known. Here, we demonstrate that CD109, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein highly expressed by keratinocytes, is an important regulator of skin homeostasis and Î³Î´17 cell activation. Genetic deletion of CD109 results in spontaneous epidermal hyperplasia, aberrant accumulation of dermal-derived Î³Î´17 cells, and enhanced susceptibility to psoriasiform inflammation. In this context, Î³Î´17 activation requires interleukin (IL)-23 signals and is reversed by transient depletion of the skin microbiota. Mechanistically, CD109 restrains Î³Î´17 cell activation in a cell-extrinsic manner by fortifying skin  . Collectively, our data provide insight into the regulation of the skin IL-23/IL-17 immune axis and how homeostasis is maintained at this important  site.Copyright Â© 2019 The Author(s).

Seeking the initiating events, we tested the hypothesis that the intestine could be damaged by repeated lipid supply and therefore participate in inflammation. In mice, 1-5 palm oil gavages increased intestinal permeability via decreased expression and mislocalization of junctional proteins at the cell-cell contacts; altered the intestinal bacterial species by decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, segmented filamentous bacteria, and Clostridium leptum; and increased inflammatory cytokine expression. This was further studied in human intestinal epithelial Caco-/TC7 cells using the two main components of palm oil, i.e., palmitic and oleic acid. Saturated palmitic acid impaired paracellular permeability and junctional protein localization, and induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the cells, but unsaturated oleic acid did not. Inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis prevented part of these effects. Altogether, our data show that short exposure to palm oil or palmitic acid induces intestinal dysfunctions targeting   and inflammation. Excessive palm oil consumption could be an early player in the gut alterations observed in metabolic diseases.Copyright Â© 2019.

The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of RAS are altered in AD in relation to established CSF markers of disease pathology (lower AÎ²42 and elevated tau) and CSF markers of capillary dysfunction. We studied 40 controls and 40 AD cases grouped according to a biomarker profile (i.e., AD cases t-tau>400 pg/mL, pTau >60 pg/mL, and AÎ²42 <550 pg/mL). Angiotensin-II converting enyme-1 (ACE1) and ACE2 enzyme activity was measured using fluorogenic peptide substrates; sPDGFRÎ² and albumin level by sandwich ELISA and angiotensin-I (Ang-I), Ang-II, and Ang-(1-7) by direct ELISA. CSF AÎ²42, total, and phosphorylated tau levels were previously measured by INNOTEST sandwich ELISA. CSF ACE1 activity was significantly elevated in AD (pâ=â0.008) and positively correlated with ACE2 in AD (râ=â0.420, pâ=â0.007). CSF ACE1 weakly correlated with t-tau (râ=â0.294, pâ=â0.066) and p-tau (râ=â0.329, pâ=â0.038) but not with AÎ²42 in the controls but not in AD. ACE1 correlated positively with sPDGFRÎ² (râ=â0.426, pâ=â0.007), a marker of pericyte injury, and ACE2 correlated positively with albumin (râ=â0.422, pâ=â0.008), a marker of blood-brain  .

Paracellular permeability is governed by intercellular tight-junctions (TJs). Zonulin is, to date, the only known physiological regulator of intestinal TJs. We used a zonulin transgenic mouse (Ztm) model characterized by increased small intestinal permeability to elucidate the role of a primary impaired gut  on microbiome composition and/or immune profile. Ztm exhibit an altered gene expression profile of TJs in the gut compared to wild-type mice (WT): Claudin-15, Claudin-5, Jam-3, and Myosin-1C are decreased in the male duodenum whereas Claudin-15, Claudin-7, and ZO- are reduced in the female colon. These results are compatible with loss of gut  function and are paralleled by an altered microbiota composition with reduced abundance of the genus , known to have positive effects on gut   and strengthening, and an increased abundance of the  genus, associated to low-grade inflammatory conditions. Immune profile analysis shows a subtly skewed distribution of immune cell subsets toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype with more IL-17 producing adaptive and innate-like T cells in Ztm. Interestingly, microbiota "normalization" involving the transfer of WT microbiota into Ztm, did not rescue the altered immune profile. Our data suggest that a primary impaired gut  causing an uncontrolled trafficking of microbial products leads to a latent pro-inflammatory status, with a skewed microbiota composition and immune profile that, in the presence of an environmental trigger, as we have previously described (1), might promote the onset of overt inflammation and an increased risk of chronic disease.Copyright Â© 2019 Miranda-Ribera, Ennamorati, Serena, Cetinbas, Lan, Sadreyev, Jain, Fasano and Fiorentino.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31419339>Characterization of cowhage-induced pruritus in inflamed and non-inflamed skin.</a></h2><p>Pruritus is a major symptom of many inflammatory diseases and impacts greatly the quality of life in patients. We aimed to specify the characteristics of experimentally induced pruritus in normal skin and in experimentally induced inflammatory dermatitis in healthy volunteers.Skin inflammation was induced by the repeated application of sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS %) on the volar forearms of 30 healthy volunteers. Inflammatory dermatitis intensity was assessed using the eczema score adapted from Frosch and Kligman. Non-histaminergic pruritus was induced by cowhage spicules rubbed on the volar forearms and recorded for 30Â min on a 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS) in both non-inflamed and inflamed skin.Induction of inflammatory dermatitis by SLS resulted in a mild inflammatory dermatitis with an inflammation score of .3Â Â±Â 0.1 within 7Â days of treatment. Cowhage-induced pruritus was of markedly higher intensity (PÂ <Â 0.001), and all but two individuals had higher maximum pruritus intensity in inflamed skin as compared to non-inflamed skin, whereas the kinetics of the pruritus response were similar. The quality of cowhage-induced pruritus was significantly different with more 'burning' and 'painful sensations' in inflamed skin (PÂ <Â 0.01). Maximum pruritus intensity in inflamed skin strongly correlated with maximum pruritus intensity in non-inflamed skin (rÂ =Â 0.51, PÂ =Â 0.004). Skin hydration, skin   and dermatitis severity did not correlate with pruritus intensity.Taken together, pruritus in inflamed skin is perceived as more intense, painful and burning. This may explain, in part, why pruritus is a major driver of quality-of-life impairment in patients with chronic inflammatory skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis.Â© 2019 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30973085>Rutin hydrate inhibits apoptosis in the brains of cadmium chloride-treated rats via preserving the mitochondrial  and inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence has suggested that cadmium (Cd) ions-induced neurotoxicity is associated with increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial-dependent and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate if rutin hydrate (RH), a well-reported neuroprotective and an antioxidant flavonoid, can ameliorate cadmium chloride (CdCl2)-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting the resultant ER stress. Rats were divided into 4 groups (nÂ =Â 16/group) of control, control + RH (100 mg/kg), CdCl (5 mg/kg), and CdCl +Â RH. All treatments were administered orally for 30Â days, on daily basis. Brain homogenates from CdCl-treated rats showed increased oxidative stress and induced activation of ER stress characterized by increasing mRNA and protein levels of GRP78, ATF-6, CHOP and Xbp-1 and protein levels of p-elF2Î±, p-JNK1/ and cleaved caspase-12. Also, CdCl significantly reduced Bcl-, enhanced Bax translocation to the mitochondrial membrane, increased cytoplasmic levels of cytochrome-C and caspase-3, and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (ÎÏm) (increased Vmax and reduced time to Vmax). In contrast, RH significantly enhanced levels GSH and activities of SOD, GSH-Px, decreased levels of MDA and inhibited mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mtPTP) in the brains of both control and CdCl-treated rats. Interestingly, in brain homogenates of CdCl-treated rats only, RH reduced all markers of ER stress, increased Bcl-, reduced mitochondrial Bax translocation and improved mitochondrial coupling. It also reduced cytosolic levels of cytochrome-C, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-12. Overall, these findings support the efficiency of RH to inhibit ER stress in brains CdCl2-treated rats which is added to its existing mechanisms of neuroprotection. : ATF-6: activating transcription factor-6; Bax: Bcl-associated x; BBB: blood-brain ; Bcl-: B-cell lymphoma ; BiP: immunoglobulin heavy-chain-binding protein; [Ca]i: intracellular free Ca concentration; Cd: cadmium; CdCl: cadmium chloride; CHOP: CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein; CMC: carboxymethyl cellulose; ÎÏm: mitochondrial membrane potential; elF2Î±: phospho-eukaryotic translation initiation factor -alpha; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD: ER-associated protein degradation; ERK1/: extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and ; GADD 153: growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 153; GRP78, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein; GSH: reduced glutathione; GSH: reduced glutathione; GSH-Px: glutathione peroxidase; GSSG: glutathione disulfide (oxidized glutathione); IRE-1: inositol-requiring enzyme-1; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; MDA: malondialdehyde; mTOR: Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin; mtPTP: mitochondrial permeability transition pore; ONOO: peroxynitrite; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; PERK: protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase; p-JNK: phospho-JNK; qPCR: quantitative PCR; RCR: respiratory control ratio; RH: rutin hydrate; RHoGDI: Rho-GDP-dissociation inhibitor; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SOD: superoxide dismutase; UPR: unfolded protein response; VDAC: voltage-dependent anion channel; Vmax: maximal rate of pore opening; Xbp-1: X-box binding protein 1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31099453>Dysregulation of focal adhesion kinase upon Toxoplasma gondii infection facilitates parasite translocation across polarised primary brain endothelial cell monolayers.</a></h2><p>The apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii invades tissues and traverses non-permissive biological barriers in infected humans and other vertebrates. Following ingestion, the parasite penetrates the intestinal wall and disseminates to immune-privileged sites such as the brain parenchyma, after crossing the blood-brain . In the present study, we have established a protocol for high-purification of primary mouse brain endothelial cells to generate stably polarised monolayers that allowed assessment of cellular  traversal by T.Â gondii. We report that T.Â gondii tachyzoites translocate across polarised monolayers of mouse brain endothelial cells and human intestinal Caco2 cells without significantly perturbing  impermeability and with minimal change in transcellular electrical resistance. In contrast, challenge with parasite lysate or LPS increased  permeability by destabilising intercellular tight junctions (TJs) and accentuated transmigration of T.Â gondii. Conversely, reduced phosphorylation of the TJ-regulator focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was observed dose-dependently upon challenge of monolayers with live T.Â gondii but not with parasite lysate or LPS. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK phosphorylation reversibly altered   and facilitated T.Â gondii translocation. Finally, gene silencing of FAK by shRNA facilitated transmigration of T.Â gondii across epithelial and endothelial monolayers. Jointly, the data demonstrate that T.Â gondii infection transiently alters the TJ stability through FAK dysregulation to facilitate transmigration. This work identifies the implication of the TJ regulator FAK in the transmigration of T.Â gondii across polarised cellular monolayers and provides novel insights in how microbes overcome the restrictiveness of biological barriers.Â© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31437166>The long-term consequences of antibiotic therapy: Role of colonic short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) system and intestinal  .</a></h2><p>Epidemiological studies revealed that antibiotics exposure increases a risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) development. It remained largely unknown how antibiotic-induced dysbiosis confers the risk for enhanced inflammatory response. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that SCFAs, their receptors and transporters mediate the antibiotic long-term effects on the functional state of colonic mucosa and susceptibility to the experimental colitis. Male Wistar rats were treated daily for 14 days with antibiotic ceftriaxone (300 mg/kg, i.m.) or vehicle; euthanized by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation in 1, 14 or 56 days after antibiotic withdrawal. We found increased cecum weight and sustained changes in microbiota composition after ceftriaxone treatment with increased number of conditionally pathogenic enterobacteria, E. coli, Clostridium, Staphylococcus spp. and hemolytic bacteria even at 56 days after antibiotic withdrawal. The concentration of SCFAs was decreased after ceftriaxone withdrawal. We found decreased immunoreactivity of the FFA2, FFA3 receptors, SMCT1 and increased MCT1 & MCT4 transporters of SCFAs in colon mucosa. These changes evoked a significant shift in colonic mucosal homeostasis: the disturbance of oxidant-antioxidant balance; activation of redox-sensitive transcription factor HIF1Î± and ERK1/ MAP kinase; increased colonic epithelial permeability and bacterial translocation to blood; morphological remodeling of the colonic tissue. Ceftriaxone pretreatment significantly reinforced inflammation during experimental colitis 56 days after ceftriaxone withdrawal, which was confirmed by increased histopathology of colitis, Goblet cell dysfunction, colonic dilatation and wall thickening, and increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-Î± and IL-10).

Littermate pairs of barrows (48.1 Â± 6.7 kg BW) were selected; 1 pig from each pair was assigned to either MhLI challenge or nonchallenge treatments (n = 12). Pigs were individually housed, fed a corn-soybean diet, and allowed to acclimate for 21 d prior to inoculation. On days postinoculation (dpi) 0, MhLI pigs were dual inoculated with LI and Mh. On dpi 21, all pigs were euthanized for ileal and colon tissue collection. Formalin-fixed tissues were clinically scored and morphology analyzed, frozen tissues assayed for digestive enzyme activities, and fresh tissues mounted into modified Ussing Chambers to assess active nutrient transport,  , and bacterial translocation. Data were analyzed using the Mixed Procedure of SAS with treatment as a fixed effect, age and start BW as covariates, and litter as a random effect. Compared with controls, MhLI pigs had decreased ADG (38%, P < 0.001), ADFI (25%, P < 0.001), and G:F (19%, P = 0.012). The MhLI dual challenge did not alter ileum morphology or transepithelial resistance (P > 0.10); however, ex vivo mucosal to serosal translocation of S.

Additionally, MhLI pigs had increased ileal glucose transport (30%, P = 0.05) and decreased sucrase activity (30%, P = 0.049) compared with controls. This MhLI challenge antagonized intestinal function and , and this may be a contributing factor to reduced pig performance.Â© The Author(s) 2019.

The neuroprotective effect of propofol has been reported. We aimed to identify whether propofol induced HSPs expression and protected BBB integrity. Mouse astrocytes and microglia cells were cultured and exposed to hypoxia and propofol. The expression of HSP27, HSP32, HSP70, and HSP90, and the translocation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and Nuclear factor-E2-related factor  (Nrf2) were investigated. Mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells, astrocytes, and microglial cells were co-cultured to establish in vitro BBB model, and the effects of hypoxia and propofol as well as HSPs knockdown/overexpression on BBB integrity were measured. Hypoxia (5% O, 5% CO, 90% humidity) treatment for 6Â h and 12Â h induced HSP27, HSP32, and HSP70 expression. Propofol (25Â Î¼Î) increased HSP27 and HSP32 expression, starting with exposure to hypoxia for 3Â h. Propofol induced HSF1 translocation from cytoplasmic to nuclear compartment, and blockade of HSF1 inhibited HSP27 expression in mouse astrocytes when they were exposed to hypoxia for 3Â h. Propofol induced Nrf2 translocation, and blockade of Nrf2 inhibited HSP32 expression in mouse microglial cells when they were exposed to hypoxia for 3Â h. Propofol protected hypoxia-impaired BBB integrity, and the effects were abolished by blockade of HSF1 and Nrf2. Overexpression of HSP27 and HSP32 alleviated hypoxia-impaired BBB integrity, and blockade of HSP27 and HSP32 expression ameliorated propofol-mediated protection against BBB impairment. Propofol may protect hypoxia-mediated BBB impairment.

Given its bioactivity, there is much interest in the potential use of bovine colostrum to improve human gastrointestinal health throughout the life span. There is evidence that bovine colostrum is effective at improving small intestinal   and some indication that it may alter colonic motility. However, for colostrum to be used as a product to improve intestinal health, it needs to be bioactive after processing. The aim of this study was to determine whether industrial processing of bovine colostrum affects its ability to improve small intestinal   or alter distal colon motility. Three colostrum sample types were compared; raw whole colostrum powder (WCP), raw skim colostrum powder (SCP), and industrially produced colostrum milk protein concentrate (CMPC). To determine whether these colostrum powders had different effects on small intestinal  , their effects on the transepithelial electrical resistance across an in vitro intestinal epithelial layer (Caco- cells) were measured, both with and without a challenge from the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-Î±. These results showed that CMPC enhanced transepithelial electrical resistance across unchallenged epithelial cell layers, whereas the raw colostrum samples, WCP and SCP, did not have an effect. The colostrum samples were also compared to determine how they affect contractility in the distal colon isolated from the rat. Skim colostrum powder was the only sample to act directly on colonic tissue to modulate motility, increasing the amplitude of contractions. The results show that bovine colostrum is able to improve small intestinal   and alter colon motility, and they implicate different components. The   enhancement was apparent only in the industrial CMPC, which may have been due to the increase in protein concentration or the release of small peptides as a result of processing. The ability to alter colon motility was present in SCP but absent in WCP, again implying that an increase in protein concentration is responsible for the effect. However, this effect was not apparent for the industrially processed CMPC, suggesting denaturation or degradation of the active component. The beneficial effect of colostrum on small intestinal   was present after processing, confirming that it is feasible to industrially produce an active product for gut health.Copyright Â© 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

We have previously shown that diabetes causes an imbalance of nerve growth factor (NGF) isoforms resulting in accumulation of its precursor proNGF and upregulation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75), with consequent increases in the activation of Ras homologue gene family, member A (RhoA). We also showed that genetic deletion of p75 in diabetes preserved the BRB and prevented inflammatory mediators in retinas. This study aims to examine the therapeutic potential of LM11A-31, a small-molecule p75 modulator and proNGF antagonist, in preventing diabetes-induced BRB breakdown. The study also examined the role of p75/RhoA downstream signalling in mediating cell permeability.Male C57BL/6Â J mice were rendered diabetic using streptozotocin injection. After Â weeks of diabetes, mice received oral gavage of LM11A-31 (50Â mgÂ kgÂ day) or saline (NaCl 154Â mmol/l) for an additional 4Â weeks. BRB breakdown was assessed by extravasation of BSA-AlexaFluor-488. Direct effects of proNGF were examined in human retinal endothelial (HRE) cells in the presence or absence of LM11A-31 or the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632.Diabetes triggered BRB breakdown and caused significant increases in circulatory and retinal TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² levels. These effects coincided with significant decreases in retinal NGF and increases in vascular endothelial growth factor and proNGF expression, as well as activation of RhoA. Interventional modulation of p75 activity through treatment of mouse models of diabetes with LM11A-31 significantly mitigated proNGF accumulation and preserved BRB . In HRE cells, treatment with mutant proNGF (10Â ng/ml) triggered increased cell permeability with marked reduction of expression of tight junction proteins, zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-5, compared with control, independent of inflammatory mediators or cell death. Modulating p75 significantly inhibited proNGF-mediated RhoA activation, occludin phosphorylation (at serine 490) and cell permeability. ProNGF induced redistribution of ZO-1 in the cell wall and formation of F-actin stress fibres; these effects were mitigated by LM11A-31.Targeting p75 signalling using LM11A-31, an orally bioavailable receptor modulator, may offer an effective, safe and non-invasive therapeutic strategy for treating macular oedema, a major cause of blindness in diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30996325>Intracellular Fe accumulation in endothelial cells and pericytes induces blood-brain  dysfunction in secondary brain injury after brain hemorrhage.</a></h2><p>After intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), iron is released from the hematoma and induces secondary brain injury.

Furthermore, hemin induced endothelial  dysfunction via disruption of junction . Based on in vitro studies, we used a hemin-injection ICH mice model in vivo. Hemin injection (10âmM/10âÂµL, i.c.) induced deleterious effects including BBB hyper-permeability, neuronal deficits, neuronal damage, altered proteins expression, and Fe in BBB composed cells. Lastly, BP (40âmg/kg, i.p.) administration attenuated neuronal deficits at 3 days after surgery. Collectively, Hb or hemin damaged BBB composed cells via Fe.

Lung endothelial   and mtDNA integrity were determined during and at the end of perfusion, respectively.Mitochondria-targeted OGG1 attenuated indices of lung endothelial dysfunction incurred after a 1h post-mortem period. Oxidative lung tissue mtDNA damage as well as accumulation of proinflammatory mtDNA fragments in lung perfusate, but not nuclear DNA fragments, also were reduced by mitochondria-targeted OGG1. A repair-deficient mt-OGG1 mutant failed to protect lungs from the adverse effects of DCD procurement.These findings suggest that endothelial  dysfunction in lungs procured after DCD is driven by mtDNA damage and point to strategies to enhance mtDNA repair in concert with EVLP as a means of alleviating DCD-related lung IR injury.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Rats subjected to 4 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion were randomized into the following groups: (1) AcSDKP; () tPA; (3) AcSDKP in combination with tPA; and (4) saline. Neurological deficits, cerebral microvascular patency and , and infarction were examined at 1 day and 7 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion. In vitro experiments were performed to examine the effect of AcSDKP on aged cerebral endothelial cell permeability. Results- Compared with saline, AcSDKP, or tPA as monotherapy did not have any therapeutic effects, whereas AcSDKP in combination with tPA significantly reduced cerebral tissue infarction and improved neurological outcome without increasing cerebral hemorrhage. Concurrently, the combination treatment significantly augmented microvascular perfusion and reduced thrombosis and blood-brain  leakage. In vitro, compared with cerebral endothelial cells from ischemic adult rats, the endothelial cells from ischemic aged rats exhibited significantly increased leakage. AcSDKP suppressed tPA-induced aged endothelial cell leakage and reduced expression of ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) and NF (nuclear factor)-ÎºB. Conclusions- The present study provides evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of AcSDKP in combination tPA for the treatment of embolic stroke in aged rats at 4 hours after stroke onset. AcSDKP likely acts on cerebral endothelial cells to enhance the benefits of tPA by increasing tissue perfusion and augmenting the  of the blood-brain .

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a multistrain probiotic on cognitive function, risk of falls, and inflammatory response in patients with cirrhosis. Consecutive outpatients with cirrhosis and cognitive dysfunction (defined by a Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score [PHES] < -4) and/or falls in the previous year were randomized to receive either a sachet of a high-concentration multistrain probiotic containing 450 billion bacteria twice daily for 12 weeks or placebo. We evaluated the changes in cognitive function (PHES); risk of falls (Timed Up and Go [TUG] test, gait speed, and incidence of falls); systemic inflammatory response; neutrophil oxidative burst; intestinal   (serum fatty acid-binding protein 6 [FABP-6] and  [FABP-] and zonulin and urinary claudin-3); bacterial translocation (lipopolysaccharide-binding protein [LBP]); and fecal microbiota. Thirty-six patients were included. Patients treated with the probiotic (n = 18) showed an improvement in the PHES ( = 0.006), TUG time ( = 0.015) and gait speed ( = 0.02), and a trend toward a lower incidence of falls during follow-up (0% compared with 22.% in the placebo group [n = 18];  = 0.10). In the probiotic group, we observed a decrease in C-reactive protein ( = 0.01), tumor necrosis factor alpha ( = 0.01), FABP-6 ( = 0.009), and claudin-3 ( = 0.002), and an increase in poststimulation neutrophil oxidative burst ( = 0.002).  The multistrain probiotic improved cognitive function, risk of falls, and inflammatory response in patients with cirrhosis and cognitive dysfunction and/or previous falls.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474986>Autoimmune-Mediated Retinopathy in CXCR5-Deficient Mice as the Result of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Associated Proteins Accumulation.</a></h2><p>Previous research has shown that CXCR5 mice develop retinal degeneration (RD) with age, a characteristic related to age macular degeneration (AMD). RD in these mice is not well-understood, and in this study, we sought to characterize further the RD phenotype and to gain mechanistic insights into the function of CXCR5 in the retina. CXCR5 and WT control mice were used. Fundus images demonstrated a significant ( < 0.001) increase of hypo-pigmented spots in the retina of aged CXCR5 mice compared with WT control mice. PAS staining indicated localization of deposits in the sub-retinal pigment epithelia (RPE) layer. AMD-associated proteins Cryab, amyloid beta, and C3d were detected within the RPE/sub-RPE tissues by immunofluorescence (IF). In addition, western blot analysis of COX-, Arg1, and VEGF-a revealed an increase in the signaling of these molecules within the RPE/choroid complex. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated a drusen-like structure of sub-RPE deposits with an accumulation of vacuolated cellular debris. Loss of photoreceptors was detected by peanut lectin staining and was corroborated by a reduction in MAP2 signaling. Loss of blood-retinal   was demonstrated by a reduction of ZO-1 expression. Inflammatory cells were detected in the sub-RPE space, with an increase in IBA-1 positive microglia cells on the surface of the RPE. Mass spectrometry analysis of CXCR5 mouse RPE/choroid proteins extracts, separated by SDS-page and incubated with autologous serum, identified autoantibodies against AMD-associated proteins: Cryaa, Cryab, and Anxa2.  evaluations in BV- cell culture indicated a significant increase in production of Arg-1 ( < 0.001) and COX- ( < 0.01) in the presence of anti-CXCR5 antibody when compared with Igg-treated control BV- cells stimulated with IL-4 and TNFÎ±/IFNÎ³, respectively. Anti-CXCR5 antibody treatment without stimulating agents did not affect Arg-1 and COX- expression; this suggests that CXCR5 may have a regulatory role in microglia cells activation. These results indicate that with age, CXCR5 mice develop RD characterized by microglia dysfunction, increased production of CXCL13 in the RPE progressive photoreceptor, neuronal loss, and sub-RPE deposition of cellular debris, resulting in the production of immunogenic proteins and autoimmune-mediated RD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31229428>Assessment of blood-brain   and neuroinflammation in preeclampsia.</a></h2><p>Although blood-brain   is intact under normal pregnancy conditions, animal studies suggest that blood-brain  impairment occurs in preeclampsia. Yet, human data are limited, and the  of the blood-brain  has not been assessed in women with preeclampsia.We sought to test the hypothesis that the  of the blood-brain  is impaired and that neuroinflammation is increased in women with preeclampsia.We performed an observational case-control study in pregnant women >24 weeks gestation who underwent spinal anesthesia for elective cesarean delivery or combined spinal epidural analgesia for labor. Cases were women with preeclampsia, and control subjects were women with either healthy pregnancy, chronic hypertension, or gestational hypertension. Paired samples of blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid were collected from each subject before delivery. We measured albumin, C5a, C5b-9, tumor necrosis factor-Î±, and interleukin-6 concentrations in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, and albumin, C5a, and C5b-9 concentrations in urine, using colorimetric or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The ratio of albumin in cerebrospinal fluid to plasma (Q) was used as a surrogate for maternal blood-brain  . Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of C5a, C5b-9, tumor necrosis factor-Î±, and interleukin-6 were used as surrogate markers of neuroinflammation. Differences in Q and cerebrospinal fluid protein concentrations between groups were assessed by nonparametric test of medians.Forty-eight subjects were enrolled, which included 16 cases with preeclampsia, 16 control subjects with healthy pregnancy, and 16 control subjects with either chronic or gestational hypertension. Q values were not increased in preeclampsia cases compared with healthy or hypertensive control subjects (Q median, 3.5 [interquartile range, .9-5.1] vs 3.9 [interquartile range, 3.0-4.8] vs 3.9 [interquartile range, 3.0-4.8]; P=.78]. Moreover, Q values were not increased in the subset of women with preeclampsia with severe features (n=8) compared with those without severe features (n=8; Q median, 3.5 [interquartile range, 3.3-4.9] vs 3.7 [interquartile range, .3-5.5]; P=.62]. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of C5a, C5b-9, tumor necrosis factor-Î± and interleukin-6 were not increased in cases of preeclampsia, compared with control subjects with either healthy pregnancy, chronic hypertension, or gestational hypertension (P>.05, all comparisons). In contrast to the negative findings in cerebrospinal fluid, plasma concentrations of both C5b-9 and interleukin-6 and urine concentrations of C5a and C5b-9 were increased in cases of preeclampsia.Through measurements of albumin, complement proteins, and cytokines in paired samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid at the time of delivery, we found no evidence of blood-brain  impairment or neuroinflammation in preeclampsia. Larger studies that will investigate a wider range of proteins are suggested to validate our findings.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The basolateral Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) has been implicated in intestinal epithelial fluid secretion. Two patients with deleterious heterozygous (NKCC1-DFX) or homozygous (Kilquist) mutations in SLC12A2 (NKCC1) suffer from gastrointestinal deficits. Due to chronic infections, the colon and the small intestine of the NKCC1-DFX patient were surgically resected.To investigate how NKCC1 affects the  and function of the gut epithelia, we used a mouse model recapitulating the NKCC1-DFX patient mutation. Electron microscopy and immunostaining were used to analyze the  of the colonic mucus layers and immune cells infiltration. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on the distal colon sections to measure bacteria translocation to the mucosa and submucosa. Citrobacter rodentium was used to measure mouse ability to clear enteric infection. Multiplex cytokine assay was used to analyze mouse inflammatory response to infection.We show that NKCC1-DFX expression causes defective goblet cells mucus granule exocytosis, leading to secretion of intact granules into the lumen of the large intestine. In addition, NKCC1-DFX colon submucosal glands secrete mucus that remained attached to the epithelium. Importantly, expression of the mutant NKCC1 or complete loss of NKCC1 function leads to aggravated inflammatory response to Citrobacter rodentium infection. Compared to wild-type, NKCC1-DFX mice showed decreased expression of claudin-, a tight junction protein involved in paracellular Na and water transport and enteric infection clearance.Our data indicate that NKCC1-DFX impairs gut  function by affecting mucus secretion and immune properties.Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors.

Group E was intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to create an animal model of intestinal injury. Group T was intragastrically administered  suspension 7 d before LPS. Group C was intraperitoneally injected with normal saline. The rats were killed at , 6 or 12 h after LPS or physiological saline injection to collect ileal tissue samples. The expression of ileal CINC mRNA was evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and expression of ileal IGF-1 protein and mRNA was detected by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, respectively.The ileum of rats in Group C did not express CINC mRNA, ileums from Group E expressed high levels, which was then significantly decreased in Group T ( = 23.947,  < 0.05). There was no significant difference in CINC mRNA expression at different times ( = 0.665,  > 0.05). There was a high level of IGF-1 brown granules in ileal crypts and epithelial cells in Group C, sparse staining in Group E, and dark, dense brown staining in Group T.

Recently it has gained more popularity, being used in many clinical conditions. Nowadays, the cases of glaucoma induced by topiramate have increased due to the use of this drug to induce weight loss. We here described a 29-year-old female presented with a one-day history of blurred vision in both eyes and headache. She was using a weight loss formula containing topiramate 100 milligrams. Ophthalmologic exam revealed an important myopic shift of -7.00 spherical diopters at presentation with intraocular pressure (IOP) of 32 mmHg and a shallow anterior chamber in both eyes. After discontinuous of topiramate and use of cycloplegic eyedrops, myopic shift improved and IOP controlled after two days. The anterior chamber was significantly deeper in both eyes after two weeks. It is theorized that topiramate can provoke a ciliochoroidal effusion and, therefore, can cause an anterior displacement of lens-iris diaphragm with a secondary angular closure. The treatment must include cycloplegic and discontinuation of the drug. Sulfa-containing drugs lead to an indirect mechanism of angle closure, frequently bilateral and, as mentioned above, with a different treatment approach. If unrecognized and untreated, it can provoke high morbidity with possibility of bilateral permanent visual loss.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31118506>Angiotensin II-mediated MYH9 downregulation causes structural and functional podocyte injury in diabetic kidney disease.</a></h2><p>MYH9, a widely expressed gene encoding nonmuscle myosin heavy chain, is also expressed in podocytes and is associated with glomerular pathophysiology. However, the mechanisms underlying MYH9-related glomerular diseases associated with proteinuria are poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the role and mechanism of MYH9 in diabetic kidney injury. MYH9 expression was decreased in glomeruli from diabetic patients and animals and in podocytes treated with Ang II in vitro. Ang II treatment and siRNA-mediated MYH9 knockdown in podocytes resulted in actin cytoskeleton reorganization, reduced cell adhesion, actin-associated protein downregulation, and increased albumin permeability. Ang II treatment increased NOX4 expression and ROS generation. The Ang II receptor blocker losartan and the ROS scavenger NAC restored MYH9 expression in Ang II-treated podocytes, attenuated disrupted actin cytoskeleton and decreased albumin permeability. Furthermore, MYH9 overexpression in podocytes restored the effects of Ang II on the actin cytoskeleton and actin-associated proteins. Ang II-mediated TRPC6 activation reduced MYH9 expression. These results suggest that Ang II-mediated MYH9 depletion in diabetic nephropathy may increase filtration  permeability by inducing structural and functional podocyte injury through TRPC6-mediated Ca influx by NOX4-mediated ROS generation. These findings reveal a novel MYH9 function in maintaining urinary filtration  .

Previously, we have reported the skin anti-aging effects of  HY7714 (HY7714) in a clinical trial. To prove the protective skin effects of HY7714 through the intestinal tight junction (TJ), we investigated the effects of HY7714 on the intestines through tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± induced TJ defects in Caco- cells. Specifically, 24 h treatment with HY7714 restored the decreased expression of zonula occludens-1, occludin, and claudin-1 compared to the TNF-Î±-treated groups (<0.05). It also attenuated the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6, 8, and 1Î². Further, increases in the mRNA levels of Elk-1, nuclear factor-ÎºB, and myosin light chain kinase expression induced by TNF-Î± were recovered by HY7714.

A total of 240 one-day-old chicks were allocated into 3 treatments of 10 replicates each. Control broilers reared at a thermoneutral temperature were fed a basal diet, whereas broilers in heat stress and MOS groups raised at a cyclic high temperature (32 to 33Â°C for 8 h/d) were given the basal diet supplemented with 0 or 250Â mg/kg MOS, respectively. Compared with control group, heat stress decreased (P < 0.05) average daily gain and feed conversion ratio during grower, finisher, and entire periods, average daily feed intake during finisher and entire periods, and ileal superoxide dismutase activity at 42 D, whereas increased (P < 0.05) rectal temperature at 21 and 42 D and jejunal malondialdehyde content at 42 D.

However, the target cells and molecular actions of HES in the intestine are mainly unknown. Employing a model of human endothelial (HUVEC) and intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-), we investigated the impact of HES, albumin and HES/albumin on cellular /permeability and evaluated underlying molecular mechanisms. Monolayers of HUVEC and Caco- were cultured with HES (3%), albumin (3%) or HES/albumin (1.5%/1.5%).  and permeability of the cell layers were evaluated by FITC-dextran transfer, measurements of cell detachment, vitality, cell volume, LDH release and caspase-3/7 activity. Cellular mechanisms were analyzed by Westernblotting for P-akt, P-erk, claudin-3 and I-FABP. HES application resulted in higher numbers of non-adherent/floating HUVEC cells (P<0.05) but did not change vitality or cell volume. Both, HES and HES/albumin increased the permeability of HUVEC monolayers (P<0.001), while LDH release, caspase-3/7 activity, akt/erk phosphorylation and claudin-3 expression were not affected. HES and HES/albumin did not change any of the parameters in cultures of Caco- cells. HES is able to disturb the  of the endothelial but not the epithelial  in vitro.

Exquisite temporospatial control of the GREM1-BMP interaction is required during development, and perturbation of this balance leads to abnormal limb formation and defective kidney development. In addition to inhibition of BMP signaling, several other noncanonical signaling modalities of GREM1 have been postulated. Some literature reports have suggested that GREM1 can bind to and activate vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- (VEGFR2) in endothelial cells, human kidney epithelial cells, and others. These reports suggest that the GREM1Ã VEGFR2 signaling can drive angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. We report here that, despite exhaustive attempts, we did not observe GREM1 activation of VEGFR2 in any of the cell lines reported by the above-mentioned studies. Incubation of endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with recombinant VEGF triggered a robust increase in VEGFR2 tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, no VEGFR2 phosphorylation was detected when cells were incubated with recombinant GREM1 over a range of time points and concentrations. We also show that GREM1 does not interfere with VEGF-mediated VEGFR2 activation, suggesting that GREM1 does not bind with any great affinity to VEGFR2. Measurements of ECFC   revealed that VEGF induces  function disruption, but recombinant human GREM1 had no effect in this assay. We believe that these results provide an important clarification on the potential interaction between GREM1 and VEGFR2 in mammalian cells.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31425857>Microcontainers for oral insulin delivery - In vitro studies of permeation enhancement.</a></h2><p>Oral delivery of peptides is challenging due to their low uptake through the small intestinal epithelium. Tight junctions, connecting the enterocytes, impede permeability, often necessitating the use of permeation enhancers in the formulation. Loading of peptide and permeation enhancer into micro-scale devices, such as microcontainers, can potentially confine the effective absorptive area through unidirectional release and thereby enhance absorption. This concept is investigated by in vitro permeation studies of insulin across Caco- cell and Caco-/HT29-MTX-E12 co-culture monolayers mimicking the intestinal absorption . The importance of proximity between the microcontainers and the  is assessed, by keeping the amounts of insulin and sodium caprate fixed throughout all experiments, while collectively orienting the unidirectional release towards the cell monolayers. Increasing the distance is observed to have a negative effect on insulin permeation matching a one-phase exponential decay , while no difference in insulin transport is observed between Caco- and co-culture monolayers. Although there are no signs of cytotoxicity caused by the microcontainer material, reversible cell deterioration, as a consequence of high local concentrations of sodium caprate, becomes evident upon qualitative assessment of the cell monolayers. These results both suggest a potential of increasing oral bioavailability of peptides by the use of microcontainers, while simultaneously visualising the ability of regaining monolayer integrity upon local permeation enhancer induced toxicity.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the response of the bronchial epithelium to fish allergens has never been explored. Parvalbumins (PVs) from bony fish are major sensitizers in fish allergy, while cartilaginous fish and their PVs are considered less allergenic. Increasing evidence demonstrates that components other than proteins from the allergen source, such as low molecular weight components smaller than 3âkDa (LMC) from pollen, may act as adjuvants during allergic sensitization. We investigated the response of bronchial epithelial cells to PVs and to LMC from Atlantic cod, a bony fish, and gummy shark, a cartilaginous fish. Polarized monolayers of the bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE14o- were stimulated apically with fish PVs and/-or the corresponding fish LMC.  , transport of PVs across the monolayers and release of mediators were monitored. Intact PVs from both the bony and the cartilaginous fish were rapidly internalized by the cells and transported to the basolateral side of the monolayers. The PVs did not disrupt the epithelial   nor did they modify the release of proinflammatory cytokines. In contrast, LMC from both fish species modified the physical and immunological properties of the epithelial  and the responses differed between bony and cartilaginous fish. While the   was lowered by cod LMC 24âh after cell stimulation, it was increased by up to .3-fold by shark LMC. Furthermore, LMC from both fish species increased basolateral and apical release of IL-6 and IL-8, while CCL2 release was increased by cod but not by shark LMC. In summary, our study demonstrated the rapid transport of PVs across the epithelium which may result in their availability to antigen presenting cells required for allergic sensitization. Moreover, different cell responses to LMC derived from bony versus cartilaginous fish were observed, which may play a role in different allergenic potentials of these two fish classes.Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors.

Although vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is associated with blood-brain  (BBB) disorders and neurological disease, its role in POCD is unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of brain VEGF inhibition on isoflurane-induced cognitive impairment in an aged rat model of POCD. VEGF protein expression was increased in the hippocampus after isoflurane exposure, suggesting that inhalation anaesthesia induces hippocampal VEGF protein overexpression in aged rats. Pretreatment with Â mg/kg RB-222, an anti-VEGF neutralizing antibody, may partially abolish the degradation of occludin protein in cerebral capillaries, thereby maintaining the ultrastructural and functional  of the hippocampal BBB. Inhibition of VEGF also significantly attenuated the isoflurane-induced cognitive deficits in the Morris water maze task. Together, our findings show, for the first time, that elevated expression of brain VEGF after isoflurane exposure contributes to POCD in aged rats.

Epithelial cells are unique in their ability to form polarized monolayers and their  function. Cell polarity induces an asymmetry in the epithelial monolayer, which is maintained by tight junctions and specialized sorting machinery. This differential localization can have a potential impact of virus infection. Asymmetrical distribution of a viral receptor can restrict virus entry to a particular membrane while polarized sorting can lead to a directional release of virions. The present study examined the impact of cell polarity on ZIKV infection and release.A polarized Caco- cell model we described previously was used to assess ZIKV infection. Transepithelial resistance (TEER) was used to assess epithelial cell polarity, and virus infection was measured by immunofluorescence microscopy and qRT-PCR. Cell permeability was measured using a fluorescein leakage assay. Statistical significance was calculated using one-way ANOVA and significance was set at pÂ <â0.05.Using the Caco- cell model for polarized epithelial cells, we report that Zika virus preferentially infects polarized cells from the apical route and is released vectorially through the basolateral route. Our data also indicates that release occurs without disruption of cell permeability.Our results show that ZIKV has directional infection and egress in a polarized cell system. This mechanism of directional infection may be one of the mechanisms that enables the cross the epithelial  effectively without a disruption in cell monolayer . Elucidation of entry and release characteristics of Zika virus in polarized epithelial cells can lead to better understanding of virus dissemination in the host, and can help in developing effective therapeutic interventions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31357693>Effect of Manitoba-Grown Red-Osier Dogwood Extracts on Recovering Caco- Cells from HO-Induced Oxidative Damage.</a></h2><p>Red-osier dogwood, a native species of flowering plant in North America, has been reported to have anti-oxidative properties because of abundant phenolic compounds; this could be promising as a functional food or a feed additive. In the present study, an oxidative damage model using 1.0 mM hydrogen peroxide (HO) in Caco- cells was established to evaluate the antioxidative effects of red-osier dogwood extracts (RDE). The results showed that 1.0 mM HO pre-exposure for 3 h significantly decreased cell viability, and increased interleukin 8 (IL-8) secretion and the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Caco- cells were treated with 100 Âµg/mL RDE for 24 h after pre-exposure to HO. It was found that the decreased cell viability caused by HO was significantly restored by a subsequent 100 Âµg/mL RDE treatment. Furthermore, the IL-8 secretion and ROS level were significantly blocked by RDE, accompanied by the enhanced gene expression of hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and the enhanced protein expression of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived )-like  (Nrf-). Moreover, RDE improved  functions in Caco- cells. Using RDE reduced the diffusion of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran and increased the transepithelial resistance (TEER) value.

IBS symptoms, gene expression of elements of the epithelial , fecal serine protease activity, and visceral sensitivity were assessed.The MC numbers per mm were .0 (0.0-6.0) in patients with IBS (nÂ =Â 43) and 3.5 (1.1-9.1) in HS (nÂ =Â 20, PÂ =Â .26). Of these, MCs were 0.0 (0.0-20) % vs 3.1 (0.0-18) % (PÂ =Â .76) in IBS and HS, respectively, in co-localization with nerve fibers. MC characteristics were equivalent in the different IBS subtypes. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified two distinct groups among patients with IBS: MC high (higher MC numbers and proportions of MCs co-localizing with nerves) and MC low (lower MC numbers and proportions of MCs co-localizing with nerves). The MC high and MC low groups could not be discriminated with regard to IBS symptoms, parameters of visceral sensitivity, gene expression of elements of the epithelial , and fecal protease activity.There was no evidence of increased infiltration or altered localization of MCs in the colonic mucosa of patients with IBS. These MC characteristics were not linked to global IBS symptoms or mucosal expression of elements of the epithelial . These findings indicate that quantity and location of mucosal MCs are factors not involved in the pathophysiology of IBS.Â© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202650>Effect of fermented milk from Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris strain JFR1 on Salmonella invasion of intestinal epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>The process of fermentation contributes to the organoleptic properties, preservation, and nutritional benefits of food. Fermented food may interfere with pathogen infections through a variety of mechanisms, including competitive exclusion or improving intestinal  . In this study, the effect of milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris JFR1 on Salmonella invasion of intestinal epithelial cell cultures was investigated. Epithelial cells (HT29-MTX, Caco-, and cocultures of the ) were treated for 1 h with Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris JFR1 fermented milk before infection with Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica Typhimurium. Treatment with fermented milk resulted in increased transepithelial electrical resistance, which remained constant for the duration of infection (up to 3 h), illustrating a protective effect. After gentamicin treatment to remove adhered bacterial cells, enumeration revealed a reduction in numbers of intracellular Salmonella. Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR data indicated a downregulation of Salmonella virulence genes hilA, invA, and sopD after treatment with fermented milk. Fermented milk treatment of epithelial cells also exhibited an immunomodulatory effect reducing the production of proinflammatory IL-8. In contrast, chemically acidified milk (glucono delta-lactone) failed to show the same effect on monolayer , Salmonella Typhimurium invasion, and gene expression as well as immune modulation. Furthermore, an oppA knockout mutant of Salmonella Typhimurium infecting treated epithelial cells did not show suppressed virulence gene expression. Collectively, these results suggest that milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris JFR1 is effective in vitro in the reduction of Salmonella invasion into intestinal epithelial cells. A functional OppA permease in Salmonella is required to obtain the antivirulence effect of fermented milk.The Authors.

Previous studies of CTE in mice expressing mutant EpCAM show neonatal lethality. Hence, to study the cellular, molecular, and physiological alterations that result from EpCAM mutation, a tamoxifen-inducible mutant EpCAM enteroid model has been generated. The presence of mutant EpCAM in the model was confirmed at both mRNA and protein levels. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated the reduced expression of mutant EpCAM. Mutant enteroids had reduced budding potential as well as significantly decreased mRNA expression for epithelial lineage markers (), proliferation marker  and secretory pathway transcription factors (, . Significantly decreased numbers of Paneth and goblet cells were confirmed by staining. These findings were correlated with intestinal tissue from CTE patients and the mutant mice model that had significantly fewer Paneth and goblet cells than in healthy counterparts. FITC-dextran studies demonstrated significantly impaired   in monolayers derived from mutant enteroids compared with control monolayers. In conclusion, we have established an ex vivo CTE model. The role of EpCAM in the budding potential, differentiation, and   of enteroids is noted. Our study establishes new facets of EpCAM biology that will aid in understanding the pathophysiology of CTE and role of EpCAM in health and disease. Here, we develop a novel ex vivo enteroid model for congenital tufting enteropathy (CTE) based on epithelial cell adhesion molecule ( gene mutations found in patients. With this model we demonstrate the role of EpCAM in maintaining the functional homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium, including differentiation, proliferation, and  integrity. This study further establishes a new direction in EpCAM biology that will help in understanding the detailed pathophysiology of CTE and role of EpCAM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31112772>Escherichia coli K12: An evolving opportunistic commensal gut microbe distorts   in human intestinal cells.</a></h2><p>Commensal enteric microbes under specific conditions viz. immunocompromised system, altered microbiota or uncompetitive niche induce their otherwise dormant pathogenic phenotype to distort host cellular functioning. Here we investigate how under in vitro environment established by using Caco-â¯cells, commensal gut microbe E. coli K12 (ATCC 14849) disrupt intestinal epithelial  function. Caco-â¯cells exposed to E. coli showed the time dependent significant (Pâ¯<â¯0.01) decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and concomitantly increased phenol red flux across cell monolayer in contrast to non infected control cells. E. coli infected intestinal cells were observed with suppressed (pâ¯<â¯0.05) mRNA levels of ZO-1, Claudin-1, Occludin and Cingulin-1 in contrast to significantly (pâ¯<â¯0.05) higher PIgR and hbd- mRNA fold changes. Immunofluorescent and electron micrographs revealed the disrupted distribution and localisation of specific tight junction proteins (Zo-1 and Claudin-1) and actin filament in E. coli infected Caco-â¯cells that ultimately resulted in deformed cellular morphology. Taken together, E. coli K12 under compromised in vitro milieu disrupted the intestinal  functions by decreasing the expression of important tight junction genes along with the altered distribution of associated proteins that increased the intestinal permeability as reflected by phenol red flux and TEER values.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

During sprouting angiogenesis, endothelial tip and stalk cells coordinately remodel their cell-cell junctions to allow collective migration and extension of the sprout while maintaining  . All these processes require energy, and the predominant ATP generation route in endothelial cells is glycolysis. However, it remains unclear how ATP reaches the plasma membrane and intercellular junctions. In this study, we demonstrate that the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) is required for sprouting angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo through the regulation of endothelial cell-junction dynamics and collective migration. We show that PKM2-silencing decreases ATP required for proper VE-cadherin internalization/traffic at endothelial cell-cell junctions. Our study provides fresh insight into the role of ATP subcellular compartmentalization in endothelial cells during angiogenesis. Since manipulation of EC glycolysis constitutes a potential therapeutic intervention route, particularly in tumors and chronic inflammatory disease, these findings may help to refine the targeting of endothelial glycolytic activity in disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31454513>Gut microbiome: An intermediary to neurotoxicity.</a></h2><p>There is growing recognition that the gut microbiome is an important regulator for neurological functions. This review provides a summary on the role of gut microbiota in various neurological disorders including neurotoxicity induced by environmental stressors such as drugs, environmental contaminants, and dietary factors. We propose that the gut microbiome remotely senses and regulates CNS signaling through the following mechanisms: 1) intestinal bacteria-mediated biotransformation of neurotoxicants that alters the neuro-reactivity of the parent compounds; ) altered production of neuro-reactive microbial metabolites following exposure to certain environmental stressors; 3) bi-directional communication within the gut-brain axis to alter the intestinal  integrity; and 4) regulation of mucosal immune . Distinct microbial metabolites may enter systemic circulation and epigenetically reprogram the expression of host genes in the CNS, regulating neuroinflammation, cell survival, or cell death. We will also review the current tools for the study of the gut-brain axis and provide some suggestions to move this field forward in the future.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 128 weaned piglets [(LandraceÂ ÃÂ Yorkshire)Â ÃÂ Duroc] with an average body weight (BW) of (6.55Â Â±Â 0.25Â kg; 21Â d of age) were randomly assigned to four dietary treatments: (1) a corn-soybean basal diet; () basal dietÂ +Â 3,000Â mg/kg conventional ZnO; (3) basal dietÂ +Â 200Â mg/kg HiZox; (4) basal dietÂ +Â 500Â mg/kg HiZox. The experiments lasted for 28Â days. Incremental HiZox in the diet increased ADG (linear pÂ =Â 0.015; quadratic pÂ =Â 0.043) and ADFI (linear pÂ =Â 0.027; quadratic pÂ =Â 0.038), and the diarrhea index decreased linearly and quadratically (pÂ <Â 0.01) as HiZox supplemented increased. Furthermore, supplementation with HiZox increased the amounts of Lactobacillus spp. (pÂ <Â 0.05) in the ileum and cecum in comparison with that of control treatment or 3,000Â mg/kg ZnO treatment, while decreased the populations of Escherichia coli, Clostridium coccoides, and Clostridium. leptum subgroup (pÂ <Â 0.05) in the ileum and cecum relative to those in control treatment. The addition of HiZox increased the villus height and villus-to-crypt ratio (VC) of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum (pÂ <Â 0.05), while decreased the crypt depth of jejunum (pÂ <Â 0.05) and tended to reduce the crypt depth of duodenum (pÂ <Â 0.10) compared with the control treatment.

The results suggested that supplementation with HiZox modulated intestinal microbial composition and improved intestinal morphology, which may exert protective effects on the  of the mucosal  function of weaned piglets, was as efficacious as pharmaceutical doses of ZnO in enhancing growth performance, indicating that the HiZox may be a promising alternative to pharmaceutical doses of ZnO.Â© 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055159>Influence of sperm filtration and the addition of glycerol to UHT skimmed milk- and TEST-based extenders on the quality and fertilizing capacity of chilled ram sperm.</a></h2><p>The poor fertility of ram semen stored chilled for long periods has encouraged the development of protocols designed to improve the kinetic vigour and cervical -crossing capacity of sperm. The present work evaluated the effect of sperm selection with Sephadex filtration and the supplementation of % glycerol (GLY) to extenders based on ultra-heat-treated skimmed milk (UHT) or Tris-Tes-Glucose (TEST) on ram sperm kinetic parameters, plasma membrane , acrosome , mitochondrial function and fertilizing ability, over long chilling times. The results showed that for non-filtered semen, values for progressive sperm motility (%PSM), straight line velocity (VSL, Î¼m/s) and the percentage of sperm with an intact plasma membrane/intact acrosome/a high mitochondrial function index (%IPIAHM) at all times up to 96â¯h of chilling were higher when the UHT extender (Pâ¯<â¯0.01) was used compared to TEST extender irrespective of the presence of GLY. When semen was previously filtered with Sephadex, the addition of GLY to the UHT extender improved total motility (%TM), the %PSM and the VSL at 96â¯h compared to all other treatments (Pâ¯<â¯0.01). The best results of all were obtained with non-filtered semen and UHT either with or without GLY. Heterologous IVF using zona-intact bovine oocytes was used to assess the fertilizing capacity of non-filtered fresh (FS0), chilled-for-24â¯h (CS24) or chilled-for-48â¯h (CS48) ram semen diluted in UHT extender (GLY-free). Heterologous IVF showed that ram sperm, either FS0, CS24 or CS48, were equally capable of penetrating zona pellucida intact bovine oocytes, leading to pronuclear formation and hybrid embryo cleavage (46.3â¯Â±â¯3.; 48.8â¯Â±â¯3.; and 43.3â¯Â±â¯3.5, respectively). No differences were seen with respect to fresh sperm in terms of sperm binding, penetration, polyspermy, pronucleus formation or cleavage rates (Pâ¯>â¯0.05). In conclusion, neither Sephadex filtration nor addition of glycerol provided extra benefits to ram sperm chilled up to 96â¯h. Chilled, non-filtered sperm extended with UHT without GLY showed better sperm functionality than did similar sperm extended with TEST extenders. Indeed, sperm diluted in UHT extender, maintained fertilizing ability up to 48â¯h.Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

SDR9C7 encodes a short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 9C member 7 (SDR9C7) recently found mutated in ichthyosis. In a patient with SDR9C7 mutation and a mouse Sdr9c7 knockout model we show loss of covalent binding of epidermal ceramides to protein, a structural fault in the . For reasons unresolved, protein binding requires lipoxygenase-catalyzed transformations of linoleic acid (18:) esterified in Ï-O-acylceramides. In Sdr9c7-/- epidermis, quantitative LC-MS assays revealed almost complete loss of a species of Ï-O-acylceramide esterified with linoleate-9,10-trans-epoxy-11E-13-ketone; other acylceramides related to the lipoxygenase pathway were in higher abundance. Recombinant SDR9C7 catalyzed NAD+-dependent dehydrogenation of linoleate 9,10-trans-epoxy-11E-13-alcohol to the corresponding 13-ketone, while ichthyosis mutants were inactive. We propose, therefore, that the critical requirement for lipoxygenases and SDR9C7 is in producing acylceramide containing the 9,10-epoxy-11E-13-ketone, a reactive moiety known for its non-enzymatic coupling to protein. This suggests a mechanism for coupling of ceramide to protein and provides important insights into skin  formation and pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169313>The protective effect of nigeglanine on dextran sulfate sodium-induced experimental colitis in mice and Caco- cells.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) was a nonspecific inflammatory disease. The treatment of UC is imperative. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of nigeglanine on dextran sulfate sodium-induced UC in experimental mice and Caco- cells and define the underlying mechanism. The nigeglanine was shown a significant protective effect on the colon, significantly reduced the weight and colon length loss and inhibited intestinal epithelial cell damage. Nigeglanine also reduced proinflammatory factors and increased anti-inflammatory factor production. The results indicate that nigeglanine suppresses the nuclear factor kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinases pathways in addition to NLRP3 inflammasome action, inhibiting colon epithelial cell pyroptosis. Surprisingly, ZO-1 and occludin protein levels increased with nigeglanine treatment, suggesting that nigeglanine plays a protective role in  , reducing colitis progression.

The present study investigated relationships among tight junction protein gene expression, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection, and intestinal mucosal morphology in piglets. We compared the expression of six tight junction proteins (ZO-1, ZO-, Occludin, Claudin-1, Claudin-4, and Claudin-5) between seven-day-old piglets infected with PEDV and normal piglets, as well as in PEDV-infected porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2). We also evaluated differences in mucosal morphology between PEDV-infected and normal piglets. The expression of six tight junction protein genes was lower in PEDV-infected piglets than in the normal animals. The expression of ZO-1, ZO-, Occludin, and Claudin-4 in the intestine tissue was significantly lower (pâ¨0.05) in PEDV-infected than in normal piglets. The expression of Claudin-5 in the jejunum was significantly lower in PEDV-infected piglets than in the normal animals (pâ¨0.01). The expression of Claudin-1 and Claudin-5 genes in the ileum was significantly higher in PEDV-infected piglets than in normal piglets (pâ¨0.01). Morphologically, the intestinal mucosa in PEDV-infected piglets exhibited clear pathological changes, including breakage and shedding of intestinal villi. In PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells, the mRNA expression of the six tight junction proteins showed a downward trend; in particular, the expression of the Occludin and Claudin-4 genes was significantly lower (pâ¨0.01). These data suggest that the expression of these six tight junction proteins, especially Occludin and Claudin-4, plays an important role in maintaining the  of the intestinal mucosal  and resistance to PEDV infection in piglets.CopyrightÂ© by the Polish Academy of Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191319>Neuroprotective Effects and Hepatorenal Toxicity of Angong Niuhuang Wan Against Ischemia-Reperfusion Brain Injury in Rats.</a></h2><p>Angong Niuhuang Wan (AGNHW) is a classic prescription in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) used for stroke treatment, but its efficacies remain to be confirmed. With its arsenic- and mercury-containing materials, the application of AGNHW raises great safety concerns. Herein, we aim to explore the neuropharmacological effects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury and evaluate the toxicological effects of AGNHW for better use. Male SD rats were subjected to  h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and following 22 h of reperfusion. AGNHW (257 mg/kg, 1Ã AGNHW) were orally administered for pharmacological effects and 257, 514, and 1,028 mg/kg (equivalent to 1Ã, Ã, 4Ã AGNHW) were used for the toxicological study. The results revealed that AGNHW treatment reduced the infarct size and protected the blood-brain  (BBB)  in the MCAO rat ischemic stroke model. AGNHW treatment up-regulated bcl- expression and down-regulated the expressions of Bax, p47, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), and inhibited the expressions and activities of matrix metalloproteinase- (MMP-), MMP-9, and reserved tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-5 in the ischemic brains. These results indicated that the neuroprotective mechanisms of AGNHW could be associated with its antioxidant properties by inhibiting oxidative/nitrative stress-mediated MMP activation and protecting tight junction proteins in the ischemic brains. Administration of 1Ã AGNHW for 7 days would not induce the accumulation of mercury in blood, liver, and kidney at day 14. Administration of Ã AGNHW and 4Ã AGNHW for 7 days increased the level of mercury in the kidney. For arsenic level, administration of 1Ã AGNHW for 7 days would increase the level of arsenic in the liver and blood without increase of arsenic in the kidney at day 14. Administration of Ã AGNHW and 4Ã AGNHW for 7 days would further increase the level of arsenic in the liver and blood. There is no influence on body weight, organ index, histological structures, and renal and liver functions. These results suggest that short-term treatment of AGNHW within 1 week should be safe and has neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31424755>Moisturizers.</a></h2><p>To discuss moisturizers of the skin, we need a brief discussion on the structure and  of the skin  and of the mechanism of maintaining water balance.

Little information is available concerning morphological changes in the duck intestines in response to high temperature. And the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of high temperature-induced intestinal injury remain undefined. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to play key roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression that influences various biological processes. The purpose of this study was to explore the changes in morphology and miRNA expression profiles of the three intestinal segments (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) of ducks in response to high temperature. Sixty female Shaoxing ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), 60Â days old, were allocated in two groups, including control ducks kept at 25Â Â°C, and ducks subjected to high ambient temperatures of 30-40Â Â°C for 15 successive days, which mimicked the diurnal temperature variations experienced in hot seasons. Three ducks from each group were executed at the end of feeding experiment, and the samples of three intestinal segments were collected for morphological examination and Illumina deep sequencing analyses. Histopathological examination of the intestinal mucous membrane was performed with HE staining method. The results demonstrated that varying degrees of damage to each intestinal segment were found in heat-treated ducks, and there were more severe injuries in duodenum and jejunum than those in ileum. Illumina high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic methods were employed in this study to identify the miRNA expression profile of three different intestinal tissues in control and heat-treated ducks. A total of 75,981,636, 88,345,563 and 100,179,422 raw reads were obtained from duodenum, jejunum and ileum, respectively, from which 74,797,633 clean reads in duodenal libraries, 86,406,445 clean reads in jejunal libraries, and 98,518,858 lean reads in ileal libraries were derived after quality control, respectively. And a total of 276 known and 182 novel miRNAs were identified in the three intestinal segments of ducks under control and heat-treated conditions. By comparing the same tissues in different conditions, 16, 18 and 15 miRNAs were found to be significantly differentially expressed between control and heat-treated ducks in duodenum, jejunum and ileum, respectively, of which 1 miRNA was expressed in both the duodenum and jejunum,  miRNAs were expressed in both the duodenum and ileum, and 3 miRNAs were found to be expressed in both the jejunum and ileum. In addition, two differentially expressed miRNAs in each comparison were randomly selected and validated by quantitative qRT-PCR. Gene Ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis indicated that the differentially expressed miRNAs may be involved in the high temperature-induced intestinal injury in ducks. Our work provides the comprehensive miRNA expression profiles of small intestines in the normal and heat-treated ducks. These findings suggest the involvement of specific molecular mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation to explain the high temperature-induced changes in the duck small intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31118111>The effect of 17Î²-estradiol on lactose in plasma and urine in dairy cows in late lactation.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 17Î²-estradiol on mammary tight junctions in cows in late lactation.

This systematic review assessed whether upregulating angiopoietin-1 improved outcomes in rodent models of ischaemic stroke. Random-effects models quantified the effect of angiopoietin-1 upregulation on stroke severity in terms of the size of cerebral infarction and the extent of blood-brain  permeability. Eleven studies utilising rat and mouse models of ischaemic stroke fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses demonstrated that angiopoietin-1 upregulation significantly reduced cerebral infarction size (standardised mean difference: -3.02; 95% confidence intervals: -4.41, -1.63; â<â0.001; â=â171 animals) and improved blood-brain   (standardized mean difference: -.02; 95% confidence intervals: -3.27, -0.77; â=â0.002; â=â129 animals).

We investigated the effects of removing  by superoxide dismutase (SOD) or C, the cell-permeable SOD mimetic, in protecting against asphyxia-related leukocyte recruitment. We also tested the hypothesis that xanthine oxidase activity is one source of this radical.  Anesthetized piglets were tracheostomized, ventilated, and equipped with closed cranial windows for the assessment of post-asphyxial rhodamine 6G-labeled leukocyte-endothelial adherence and microvascular permeability to sodium fluorescein in cortical venules. Asphyxia was induced by discontinuing ventilation. SOD and C were administered by cortical superfusion. The xanthine oxidase inhibitor oxypurinol was administered intravenously.  Leukocyte-venular adherence significantly increased during the initial  h of post-asphyxial reperfusion. BBB permeability was also elevated relative to non-asphyxial controls. Inhibition of  production by oxypurinol, or elimination of  by SOD or C, significantly reduced rhodamine 6G-labeled leukocyte-endothelial adherence and improved BBB , as measured by sodium fluorescein leak from cerebral microvessels.  Using three different strategies to either prevent formation or enhance elimination of  during the post-asphyxial period, we saw both reduced leukocyte adherence and preserved BBB function with treatment. These findings suggest that agents which lower  in brain may be attractive new therapeutic interventions for the protection of the neonatal brain following asphyxia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30972065>Immune Cell-Epithelial/Mesenchymal Interaction Contributing to Allergic Airway Inflammation Associated Pathology.</a></h2><p>The primary function of the lung is efficient gas exchange between alveolar air and alveolar capillary blood. At the same time, the lung protects the host from continuous invasion of harmful viruses and bacteria by developing unique epithelial  systems. Thus, the lung has a complex architecture comprising a mixture of various types of cells including epithelial cells, mesenchymal cells, and immune cells. Recent studies have revealed that Interleukin (IL-)33, a member of the IL-1 family of cytokines, is a key environmental cytokine that is derived from epithelial cells and induces type  inflammation in the  organs, including the lung. IL-33 induces allergic diseases, such as asthma, through the activation of various immune cells that express an IL-33 receptor, ST2, including ST2 memory (CD62LCD44) CD4 T cells. ST2 memory CD4 T cells have the capacity to produce high levels of IL-5 and Amphiregulin and are involved in the pathology of asthma. ST2 memory CD4 T cells are maintained by IL-7- and IL-33-produced lymphatic endothelial cells within inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) around the bronchioles during chronic lung inflammation. In this review, we will discuss the impact of these immune cells-epithelial/mesenchymal interaction on shaping the pathology of chronic allergic inflammation. A better understanding of pathogenic roles of the cellular and molecular interaction between immune cells and non-immune cells is crucial for the development of new therapeutic strategies for intractable allergic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662022>Localization of Tricellular Tight Junction Molecule LSR at Midbody and Centrosome During Cytokinesis in Human Epithelial Cells.</a></h2><p>Epithelial  and  function are maintained during cytokinesis in vertebrate epithelial tissues. The changes in localization and the roles of tricellular tight junction molecule lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) during cytokinesis are not well known, although new tricellular tight junctions form at the flank of the midbody during cytokinesis. In this study, we investigated the changes in localization and the role of LSR at the midbody and centrosome during cytokinesis using human endometrial carcinoma cell line Sawano, comparing the tricellular tight junction molecule tricellulin; bicellular tight junction molecules occludin, claudin-7, zonula occludens-1, and cingulin; and the epithelial polarized related molecules apoptosis-stimulating of p53 protein , PAR3, and yes-associated protein. During cytokinesis induced by treatment with taxol, the epithelial  was maintained and the tricellular tight junction molecules LSR and tricellulin were concentrated at the flank of the acetylated tubulin-positive midbody and in Î³-tubulin-positive centrosomes with the dynein adaptor Hook2, whereas the other molecules were localized there as well. All the molecules disappeared by knockdown using small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, by the knockdown of Hook2, the epithelial  was maintained and most of the molecules disappeared from the centrosome. These findings suggest that LSR may play crucial roles not only in  function but also in cytokinesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340909>[Protective effect of procyanidin B2 on intestinal  and against enteritis in a mouse model of trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid-induced colitis].</a></h2><p>To investigate the protective effect of procyanidin B2 (PCB2) on the intestinal  and against enteritis in mice with trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis and explore the possible mechanism.A mouse model of TNBS-induced colitis was established in male Balb/c mice aged 6-8 weeks. The successfully established mouse models were randomly divided into PCB2 treatment group (=10) and model group (=10) and were treated with daily intragastric administration of PCB2 (100 mg/kg, 0. mL) and 0. mL normal saline, respectively. After 4 weeks, the disease symptoms, intestinal inflammation, intestinal mucosal cell  function and the changes in PI3K/AKT signaling were evaluated using HE staining, immunofluorescence assay and Western blotting.The disease activity index of the mice was significantly lower and the mean body weight was significantly greater in PCB2 group than in the model group in the 3rd and 4th weeks of intervention ( &lt; 0.05). The levels of colonic inflammation and intestinal mucosal inflammatory mediators IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± were significantly lower while IL-10 was significantly higher in PCB2 group than in the model group ( &lt; 0.05). Compared with those in the model group, the mice in PCB2 treatment group showed a significantly lower positive rate of bacterial translocation in the mesenteric lymph nodes and a lower thiocyanate-dextran permeability of the intestinal mucosa ( &lt; 0.05). Western blotting showed that PCB2 treatment significantly increased the expressions of claudin-1 and ZO-1 ( &lt; 0.05) and significantly lowered the expression levels of p-PI3K and p-AKT in the intestinal mucosa as compared with those in the model group ( &lt; 0.05).PCB2 suppresses intestinal inflammation and protects intestinal mucosal functions and structural  by inhibiting intestinal PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, suggesting the potential of PCB2 as a new drug for Crohn's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31318183>Monitoring of Cell Layer  with a Current-Driven Organic Electrochemical Transistor.</a></h2><p>The  of CaCo- cell barriers is investigated by organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) in a current-driven configuration. Ion transport through cellular barriers via the paracellular pathway is modulated by tight junctions between adjacent cells. Rupturing its  by H O is monitored by the change of the output voltage in the transfer characteristics. It is demonstrated that by operating the OECT in a current-driven configuration, the sensitive and temporal resolution for monitoring the cell   is strongly enhanced as compared to the OECT transient response measurement. As a result, current-driven OECTs are useful tools to assess dynamic and critical changes in tight junctions, relevant for clinical applications as drug targeting and screening.Â© 2019 The Authors.

The iMV acts as a second line of defense and is, among other factors, crucial for the innate immunity in the gut. It is also the therapeutic location in IBD targeting aggravated leukocyte adhesion processes involving ICAM-1 and E-selectin. Specific targeting is stressed via nanoparticulate drug vehicles. Evaluating the iMV in enterocyte  models in vitro could shed light on inflammation and - processes during IBD. Therefore, we generated a  model by combining the enterocyte cell line Caco- with the microvascular endothelial cell line ISO-HAS-1 on opposite sides of a transwell filter-membrane under culture conditions which mimicked the physiological and inflamed conditions of IBD. The IBD model achieved a significant -disruption, demonstrated via transepithelial-electrical resistance (TER), permeability-coefficient (P) and increase of sICAM sE-selectin and IL-8. In addition, the impact of a prospective model drug-vehicle (silica nanoparticles, aSNP) on ongoing inflammation was examined. A decrease of sICAM/sE-selectin was observed after aSNP-exposure to the inflamed endothelium. These findings correlated with a decreased secretion of ICAM/E-selectin bearing exosomes/microvesicles, as evaluated via ELISA. Our findings indicate that aSNP treatment of the inflamed endothelium during IBD may hamper exosomal/microvesicular systemic communication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31265168>Role of lactadherin in intestinal   in experimental neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis.</a></h2><p>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most widespread and devastating gastrointestinal diseases in neonates. Destruction of the intestinal  is the main underlying cause of NEC. The aim of this study was to determine the role of lactadherin in preventing NEC in a neonatal rat model and investigate the molecular mechanism of lactadherin-mediated protection of the intestinal . Neonatal rats were divided into three groups: dam feeding (DF), NEC (NEC), and NEC supplemented with 10âÎ¼g/(gÂ·day) recombinant human lactadherin (NEC+L). Intestinal permeability, tissue damage, and cell junction protein expression and localization were evaluated. We found that lactadherin reduced weight loss caused by NEC, reduced the incidence of NEC from 100% to 46.7%, and reduced the mean histological score for tissue damage to 1.40 compared with .53 in the NEC group. Intestinal permeability of lactadherin-treated rats was significantly reduced when compared with that of the NEC group. In addition, the expression levels of JAM-A, claudin 3, and E-calcium in the ileum of NEC group animals increased compared with those in the ileum of DF group animals, and these levels decreased in the NEC+L group. Lactadherin changed the localization of claudin 3, occludin, and E-cadherin in epithelial cells. The mechanism underlying lactadherin-mediated protection of the intestinal  might be restoring the correct expression levels and localization of tight junction and adherent junction proteins. These findings suggest a new candidate agent for the prevention of NEC in newborns.Â© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31410747>Jasonia glutinosa (L.) DC., a traditional herbal medicine, reduces inflammation, oxidative stress and protects the intestinal  in a murine model of colitis.</a></h2><p>Jasonia glutinosa (L.) DC., known as rock tea (RT), is traditionally used in Spain as a digestive due to its beneficial properties in bowel disorders. The pharmacological nature of these properties has not been established yet. The aim of this work was to evaluate the therapeutic utility of RT in experimental colitis and to identify chemical constituents with anti-inflammatory and/or anti-oxidative properties. RT extract was prepared with ethanol in a Soxhlet apparatus and analysed by HPLC-DAD. Superoxide radical scavenging properties, xanthine oxidase and lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibitory activity, and capability to lower nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±) levels were measured in cell-free and cell-based assays. In the .5%-dextran-sodium sulphate (DSS) injury-repair model of ulcerative colitis (UC), mice were daily treated with sulfasalazine (SSZ, as reference drug, 100Â mg/kg bw), RT (5, 25 and 50Â mg/kg bw, p.o.), or vehicle over 20 days. Colitis was scored daily. Colon samples were examined macroscopically and histopathologically. Protein levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukins 6, and 10 (IL-6, IL-10), inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase- (COX-) were studied as markers of oxidative stress and inflammatory activity. The  of the apical epithelial layer was assessed by immunofluorescence staining of zonula ocludens-1 (ZO-1). Finally, intestinal contractility was also evaluated by isometric myography. Fifteen phenolic compounds and three pigments were identified and quantified, of which caffeoylquinic acids, and the flavonoid, quercetin-3-O-galactoside, were the most abundant. RT extract significantly scavenged superoxide radicals, inhibited 5-LOX activity, and lowered NO and TNF-Î± levels. DSS-treated mice receiving RT scored clinically lower than controls during the first 3 days of DSS treatment and during the recovery period. SSZ was less effective than RT. Anatomical and histological examination of colon samples revealed that RT significantly prevented colon shortening, increased colon thickness, and lowered the macroscopic damage score. RT also significantly prevented the increase of MPO activity, IL-6 levels, iNOS and COX- expression, the loss of ZO-1 apical expression, and normalized contractility disturbances. In conclusion, daily administration of RT showed therapeutic properties in the DSS-model of UC. The benefits of RT can likely be attributed to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant phenolic and flavonoid constituents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31290452>Hyodeoxycholic acid protects the neurovascular unit against oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation-induced injury .</a></h2><p>Calculus bovis is commonly used for the treatment of stroke in traditional Chinese medicine. Hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) is a bioactive compound extracted from calculus bovis. When combined with cholic acid, baicalin and jas-minoidin, HDCA prevents hypoxia-reoxygenation-induced brain injury by suppressing endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptotic signaling. However, the effects of HDCA in ischemic stroke injury have not yet been studied. Neurovascular unit (NVU) dysfunction occurs in ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of HDCA on the NVU under ischemic conditions in vitro. We co-cultured primary brain microvascular endothelial cells, neurons and astrocytes using a transwell chamber co-culture system. The NVU was pre-treated with 10.16 or .54 Î¼g/mL HDCA for 24 hours before exposure to oxygen-glucose deprivation for 1 hour. The cell counting kit-8 assay was used to detect cell activity. Flow cytometry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling were used to assess apoptosis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1Î², interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-Î±, and neurotrophic factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. Oxidative stress-related factors, such as superoxide dismutase, nitric oxide, malondialdehyde and Î³-glutamyltransferase, were measured using kits. Pretreatment with HDCA significantly decreased blood-brain  permeability and neuronal apoptosis, significantly increased transendothelial electrical resistance and Î³-glutamyltransferase activity, attenuated oxidative stress damage and the release of inflammatory cytokines, and increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor expression. Our findings suggest that HDCA maintains NVU morphological  and function by modulating inflammation, oxidation stress, apoptosis, and the expression of neurotrophic factors. Therefore, HDCA may have therapeutic potential in the clinical management of ischemic stroke.

Increasing evidence also suggested that TS increases glucose intolerance and the risk factor of developing type- diabetes mellitus (2DM), which, along with TS, is connected to blood-brain  (BBB) injuries, and heightens the risk of cerebrovascular disorders. Although the exact mechanism of rosiglitazone (RSG) is unknown, our previous in vitro work showed how RSG, an oral anti-diabetic drug belonging to the family of thiazolidinedione class, can protect BBB  through enhancement of nuclear factor erythroid -related factor (Nrf2) activity. Herein, we have validated the protective role of rosiglitazone against TS-induced BBB impairment in vivo. Our results revealed that RSG as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARÎ³), activates counteractive mechanisms primarily associated with the upregulation of Nrf2 and PPARÎ³ pathways which reduce TS-dependent toxicity at the cerebrovascular level. In line with these findings, our results show that RSG reduces inflammation and protects BBB . In conclusion, RSG offers a novel and promising therapeutic application to reduce TS-induced cerebrovascular dysfunction through activation of the PPARÎ³-dependent and/or PPARÎ³-independent Nrf2 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31467875>Alda-1 Prevents Pulmonary Epithelial  Dysfunction following Severe Hemorrhagic Shock through Clearance of Reactive Aldehydes.</a></h2><p>Severe hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation (HS/R) can lead to lung injury, resulting in respiratory insufficiency. We investigated whether treatment with Alda-1, an ALDH2 activator, decreased lung injury induced by severe HS/R in a rat model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups, hemorrhagic shock + placebo, hemorrhagic shock + Alda-1, and sham. All animals were heparinized, and then 50% of the total calculated blood volume was collected over 60 minutes. After 40 minutes of hemorrhagic shock, animals were reinfused with the shed blood over 40 minutes and then observed for an additional  hours. Concentrations of 4-HNE, TNF-, IL-6, and ALDH2 activity were detected; lung injury and lung wet-to-dry weight ratios were assessed. Expression of occludin and ZO-1 proteins in lung tissues was also determined. At  hours after resuscitation, lung injury was significantly reduced and the wet-to-dry weight ratio was notably decreased in the Alda-1 group compared with placebo (P<0.05). Alda-1 treatment also significantly increased the activity of ALDH2 and decreased the levels of toxic 4-HNE (P<0.05). In the Alda-1 group, IL-6 and TNF- were dramatically decreased compared with placebo-treated animals (P<0.05). Expression of occludin and ZO-1 proteins was significantly decreased in the placebo group compared with the Alda-1 group (P<0.05). Thus, in a rat model of severe HS/R, treatment with Alda-1 increased the activity of ALDH2, significantly accelerated the clearance of reactive aldehydes, and concomitantly alleviated lung injury through improvement of pulmonary epithelial   resulting in decreased alveolar epithelial tissue permeability, lung edema, and diffuse infiltration of inflammatory cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483932>Erythropoietin protects outer blood-retinal  in experimental diabetic retinopathy by up-regulating ZO-1 and occludin.</a></h2><p>To explore the mechanisms of erythropoietin (EPO) in maintaining outer blood-retinal  (BRB) in diabetic rats.Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered diabetic with intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, and then followed by intravitreal injection of EPO. Two and four weeks later, the permeability of outer BRB was examined with FITC-dextran leakage assay, following a method to demarcate the inner and outer retina based on retinal blood supply. The glyoxal-treated ARPE-19 cells, incubated with EPO, soluble EPO receptor (sEPOR), GÃ¶6976, or digoxin, were studied for cell viability and  function. The expressions of ZO-1, occludin, VEGFR2, HIF-1Î±, MAPKs, and AKT were examined with Western blot and immunofluorescence.The major Leakage of FITC-dextran was detected in the outer nuclear layer in both - and 4-week diabetic rats. The leakage was largely ameliorated in EPO-treated diabetic rats. The protein expressions of ZO-1 and occludin in the RPE-Bruch's membrane choriocapillaris complex were significantly decreased, whereas HIF-1Î± and JNK pathways were activated, in 4-week diabetic rats. These changes were prevented by EPO treatment. The in vitro study with ARPE-19 cells confirmed these changes, and the protective effect of EPO was abolished by sEPOR. GÃ¶6976 and digoxin rescued the tight junction and  function in glyoxal-treated ARPE-19 cells.In early diabetic rats, the outer BRB might be more severely damaged and its breakdown is the major factor for retinal oedema. EPO maintains the outer BRB  through down-regulation of HIF-1Î± and JNK signallings, and thus up-regulating ZO-1 and occludin expressions in RPE cells.Â© 2019 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31118073>Sex differences in the expression of cell adhesion molecules on microvesicles derived from cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells treated with inflammatory and thrombotic stimuli.</a></h2><p>There are sex differences in risk for stroke and small vessel ischemic disease in the brain. Microvesicles (MV) derived from activated cells vary by cell of origin and the stimulus initiating their release. MV released from cells activated by inflammatory and thrombotic factors have the potential to disrupt endothelial cells of the brain microvasculature. Therefore, experiments were designed to identify sex differences in the phenotype of MV released from cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) in response to inflammatory and thrombotic stimuli.Cultured HBMEC derived from 20- to 30-year-old male and female donors were treated for 20âh with medium supplemented with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±; 20âng/ml), thrombin (THR; âU/ml), or vehicle (i.e., control). MV were isolated from the conditioned media by high-speed centrifugation and quantified by digital flow cytometry by labeling with fluorophore-conjugated primary antibodies against PECAM-1, integrin Î±vÎ²3, ICAM-1, E-selectin, or MCAM. In addition, temporal uptake of labeled MV into control HBMEC was examined by confocal microscopy.Under control conditions, male HBMEC released fewer MV expressing each antigen, except for PECAM-1, than female cells (Pâ<â0.05). Neither TNFÎ± nor THR reduced cell viability. However, TNFÎ± induced apoptosis in female and male cells, whereas THR increased apoptosis marginally only in male cells. TNFÎ± increased expression of all antigens tested on MV in male cells, but only increased expression of integrin Î±vÎ²3, ICAM-1, and E-selectin on MV from female cells. THR increased expression of PECAM-1, ICAM-1, and MCAM-1 on MV from male but not female cells. MV were internalized and localized to lysosomes within 90âmin after their application to HBMEC.There are sex differences in expression of cell adhesion molecules on MV released from HBMEC under control conditions and upon activation by TNFÎ± or THR. MV taken up by unstimulated HBMEC may impact the  of the brain microvasculature and account, in part, for sex differences in vascular pathologies in the brain.</p></html>
