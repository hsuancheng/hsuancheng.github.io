At all ages di- and tripeptidase levels were 7-15-fold higher than proteinase activity. (2) Cathepsin A and D and neutral proteinase activity first decreased (during the 5 days before birth) and then increased (primarily during the first 10 days after birth) in development. The total enzyme content per unit weight of brain did not change greatly after 10 days, although specific activity fell owing to an increase in protein in older animals. (3) The developmental pattern of activities or peptidases measured with Leu- and Leu-- and of arylamidases measured with - and -beta-naphthylamides was similar to that of proteinases. Total and specific activities increased rapidly after birth; then total activity did not change and specific activity decreased. (4) The proteinase content of tissue fractions (nuclear and lysosomal-mitochondrial) similarly reached a maximal peak in the rapid growth phase of the brain. (5) The decrease of hydrolytic activity after 10 days of age seems to parallel a decrease in the rates of protein breakdown in vivo, showing parallel behavior with decreasing protein turnover. In contrast, during the first 10 days of life protein turnover and calculated rate of protein breakdown in vivo decrease while the level of hydrolytic enzymes increases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2266129>Delta-bag cell peptide from the egg-laying hormone precursor of Aplysia. Processing, primary structure, and biological activity.</a></h2><p>The bag cells of the marine mollusk Aplysia express a gene encoding a 271-residue egg-laying hormone (ELH) precursor that is processed into at least nine peptide products. Four of the peptides have been identified in bag cell releasates and are known to act as nonsynaptic neurotransmitters in the abdominal ganglion. The isolation, primary structure, and proposed biological activity of a fifth peptide product (delta-bag cell peptide (delta-BCP)) from the ELH precursor are described. delta-BCP was established to be a 39-residue peptide: NH2-Asp-Gln-Asp-Glu--Asn-Phe--Phe-Pro-Thr-Asn-Ala-Val-Ser-Met- Ser-Ala-Asp- Glu-Asn-Ser-Pro-Phe-Asp-Leu-Ser-Asn-Glu-Asp--Ala-Val-Tyr-Gln-- Asp-Leu-COOH. This sequence corresponds to residues 81-119 of the ELH prohormone and shares sequence identity with atrial gland peptides A and B. Significantly, synthetic delta-BCP stimulated Ca2+ uptake into  of secretory cells in the albumin gland in vitro, suggesting that the peptide regulates the cellular release of perivitelline fluid by the gland. Similar results were obtained with purified peptide A and a shorter version of delta-BCP (delta-BCP-(14-33)). These results indicate that delta-BCP belongs to a family of structurally related peptides with similar pharmacological activities that center at a conserved region of sequence corresponding to delta-BCP-(14-33).</p></html>
