<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29704812>А theoretical study on ionization of sartans in aqueous media and on interactions with surfactant micelles.</a></h1><p>The ionization order of sartans in aqueous media and possible way of interactions between their equilibrium forms and surfactant micelles have been theoretically investigated. The examined sartans are ampholytes ( and losartan) and a diacid (valsartan) with the close values of ionization constants. In order to get a better insight in the overlapped protolytic equilibria of sartans and to predict an affinity of the equilibrium forms interacting with micelles as biomembrane mimetic systems, the theoretical study was performed.  calculation of the optimized structures of the equilibrium forms was performed at the B3LYP/6-31G (d,p) level of the Density Functional Theory (DFT). The results of the theoretical study helped to assign the experimentally determined pK values to the corresponding ionizable centers and confirmed that in all examined compounds, the higher pK values can be attributed to ionization of tetrazole. The molecular descriptor values showed that sartans interact predominantly with the micelle surfaces. The equilibrium forms of ampholytes demonstrate higher affinity to the micelles, as compared to the forms of the diprotic acid. Additionally, it was shown that the uncharged molecular forms of ampholytes are more lipophylic then their zwitterionic forms.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) has anabolic bone effects on the physicochemical properties of the bone in diabetes. We hypothesized that ARB could inhibit AGEs-induced deleterious effects.In this study, we chose seven-week-old Leprdb/Lepr+ (db/+) and Leprdb/Leprdb (db/db) mice. After 12 week intervention by , the microarchitecture and mechanical strength of the bone of seven-week-old db/db mice were investigated systematically. Meanwhile, the molecular mechanisms of the osteoblasts were analyzed, after AGEs or  were added to the culture. Also, intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured with DCF fluorescence.Results showed that 12-week  treatment could dramatically improve trabecular bone microarchitecture through increasing BV/TV (p = 0.003, +46.7%), Tb.N (p = 0.020, +52.0%), and decreasing that of Tb.Sp (p = 0.005, -21.2%) and SMI (p = 0.007, -26.4%), comparing with the db/db group.  could also substantially raise biomechanical parameters including max load (p = 0.013, +20.7%), fracture load (p = 0.014, +70.5%),  absorption (p = 0.019, +99.4%). Besides, it could inhibit AGEs-induced damage of cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts, as well as suppressing the activation of apoptosis caused by AGEs. Moreover, co-incubation with  could prevent the AGEs-induced increase of intracellular oxidative stress and RAGE expression in osteoblasts.In conclusion, this study suggested that  might play a protective role in diabetes-related bone damages by blocking the deleterious effects of AGEs/RAGE-mediated oxidative stress. This may provide a revolutionary benefits to therapy with  on diabetic osteoporosis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Artificial neural network is a technique of data analysis, which sets out to emulate the human brain's way of working. The aim of the present work was to optimize separation of six angiotensin receptor antagonists, so-called sartans: losartan, valsartan, , telmisartan, candesartan cilexetil and eprosartan in a gradient-elution HPLC method. For this purpose, ANN as a mathematical tool was used for establishing a QSRR model based on molecular descriptors of sartans and varied instrumental conditions. The optimized model can be further used for prediction of an external congener of sartans and analysis of the influence of the analyte structure, represented through molecular descriptors, on retention behaviour. Molecular descriptors included in modelling were electrostatic, geometrical and quantum-chemical descriptors: connolly solvent excluded volume non-1,4 van der Waals , octanol/water distribution coefficient, polarizability, number of proton-donor sites and number of proton-acceptor sites. Varied instrumental conditions were gradient time, buffer pH and buffer molarity. High prediction ability of the optimized network enabled complete separation of the analytes within the run time of 15.5 min under following conditions: gradient time of 12.5 min, buffer pH of 3.95 and buffer molarity of 25 mM. Applied methodology showed the potential to predict retention behaviour of an external analyte with the properties within the training space. Connolly solvent excluded volume, polarizability and number of proton-acceptor sites appeared to be most influential paramateres on retention behaviour of the sartans.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The optimization of the analysis included two different chromatographic columns and different variables (polarity, fragmentor voltage, collision , and collision cell accelerator) of the mass spectrometer. In the case of PES extraction, ion strength of the water, pH, addition of EDTA, and the amount of the polymeric material were thoroughly investigated. The developed procedure was compared with a previously validated one based on a standard solid-phase extraction (SPE). In contrast to the SPE protocol, the PES method allowed a cost-efficient extraction of complex aqueous samples with lower matrix effect from 120 mL of water sample. Satisfactory and comparable apparent recovery values (80-119 and 70-131%) and method quantification limits (MQLs, 0.4-26 and 0.2-23 ng/L) were obtained for PES and SPE procedures, respectively, regardless of the matrix. Repeatability values lower than 27% were obtained. Finally, the developed methods were applied to the analysis of real samples from the Basque Country and , valsartan, acesulfame, and sucralose were the analytes most often detected at the highest concentrations (51-1096 ng/L).

The purpose of the current work was to investigate the role of drug-polymer miscibility on molecular mobility, measured as enthalpy relaxation (ER) of amorphous  (IBS) in ASDs.Two polymers, i.e. polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 (PVP K30) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS), were used to generate ASDs with 10% w/w of the polymer. Drug-polymer miscibility was determined using melting point depression (MPD) method. Molecular mobility was assessed from ER studies at a common degree of undercooling (DOU) (T - 13.0°C ± 0.5°C).IBS exhibited higher miscibility in PVP K30 as compared to HPMCAS at temperature > 140°C. However, extrapolation of miscibility data to storage temperature (62°C) using Flory-Huggins (F-H) theory revealed a reversal of the trend. Miscibility of IBS was found to be higher in HPMCAS (2.6%) than PVP K30 (1.3%) at 62°C. Stretched relaxation time (τ) of 17.4365 h and 7.0886 h was obtained for IBS-HPMCAS and IBS-PVP K30 ASDs, respectively.Miscibility of drug-polymer at storage temperature explained the behavior of the molecular mobility, while miscibility near the melting point provided a reverse trend. Results suggest that drug-polymer miscibility determined at temperatures higher than the storage temperature should be viewed cautiously.</p></html>
