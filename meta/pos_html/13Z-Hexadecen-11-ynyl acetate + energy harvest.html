We noted that pathway components for acetogenesis are more abundantly and consistently represented in the gut microbiomes of monozygotic twins and their mothers than components for methanogenesis or sulfate reduction and subsequently analyzed the metabolic potential of two sequenced human gut acetogens, Blautia hydrogenotrophica and Marvinbryantia formatexigens in vitro and in the intestines of gnotobiotic mice harboring a prominent saccharolytic bacterium. To do so, we developed a generally applicable method for multiplex sequencing of expressed microbial mRNAs (microbial RNA-Seq) and, together with mass spectrometry of metabolites, showed that these organisms have distinct patterns of substrate utilization. B. hydrogenotrophica targets aliphatic and aromatic amino acids. It increases the efficiency of fermentation by consuming reducing equivalents, thereby maintaining a high NAD(+)/NADH ratio and boosting  production. In contrast, M. formatexigens consumes oligosaccharides, does not impact the redox state of the gut, and boosts the yield of succinate. These findings have strategic implications for those who wish to manipulate the hydrogen economy of gut microbial communities in ways that modulate  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20926643>Composition and  harvesting capacity of the gut microbiota: relationship to diet, obesity and time in mouse models.</a></h2><p>Increased efficiency of  , due to alterations in the gut microbiota (increased Firmicutes and decreased Bacteroidetes), has been implicated in obesity in mice and humans. However, a causal relationship is unproven and contributory variables include diet, genetics and age. Therefore, we explored the effect of a high-fat (HF) diet and genetically determined obesity (ob/ob) for changes in microbiota and  harvesting capacity over time.Seven-week-old male ob/ob mice were fed a low-fat diet and wild-type mice were fed either a low-fat diet or a HF-diet for 8 weeks (n=8/group). They were assessed at 7, 11 and 15 weeks of age for: fat and lean body mass (by NMR); faecal and caecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA, by gas chromatography); faecal  content (by bomb calorimetry) and microbial composition (by metagenomic pyrosequencing).A progressive increase in Firmicutes was confirmed in both HF-fed and ob/ob mice reaching statistical significance in the former, but this phylum was unchanged over time in the lean controls. Reductions in Bacteroidetes were also found in ob/ob mice. However, changes in the microbiota were dissociated from markers of  . Thus, although the faecal  in the ob/ob mice was significantly decreased at 7 weeks, and caecal SCFA increased, these did not persist and faecal  diminished over time in both ob/ob and HF-fed mice, but not in lean controls. Furthermore, the proportion of the major phyla did not correlate with   markers.The relationship between the microbial composition and  harvesting capacity is more complex than previously considered. While compositional changes in the faecal microbiota were confirmed, this was primarily a feature of high-fat feeding rather than genetically induced obesity. In addition, changes in the proportions of the major phyla were unrelated to markers of   which changed over time. The possibility of microbial adaptation to diet and time should be considered in future studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26117418>Solid phase bio-electrofermentation of food waste to  value-added products associated with waste remediation.</a></h2><p>A novel solid state bio-electrofermentation system (SBES), which can function on the self-driven bioelectrogenic activity was designed and fabricated in the laboratory. SBES was operated with food waste as substrate and evaluated for simultaneous production of electrofuels viz., bioelectricity, biohydrogen (H2) and bioethanol. The system illustrated maximum open circuit voltage and power density of 443 mV and 162.4 mW/m(2), respectively on 9 th day of operation while higher H2 production rate (21.9 ml/h) was observed on 19th day of operation. SBES system also documented 4.85% w/v bioethanol production on 20th day of operation. The analysis of end products confirmed that H2 production could be generally attributed to a mixed /butyrate-type of fermentation. Nevertheless, the presence of additional metabolites in SBES, including formate, lactate, propionate and ethanol, also suggested that other metabolic pathways were active during the process, lowering the conversion of substrate into H2. SBES also documented 72% substrate (COD) removal efficiency along with value added product generation. Continuous evolution of volatile fatty acids as intermediary metabolites resulted in pH drop and depicted its negative influence on SBES performance. Bio-electrocatalytic analysis was carried out to evaluate the redox catalytic capabilities of the biocatalyst. Experimental data illustrated that solid-state fermentation can be effectively integrated in SBES for the production of value added products with the possibility of simultaneous solid waste remediation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

PMMFCs were examined at three types of shocks (chromium, hypochlorite and ) in a batch-mode chamber, and exhibited various responses to shock types and concentrations. The power output of PMMFC sensor was four times as the carbon cloth (CC)-based MFCs, indicating the advantage of paper-based anode for bacterial adhesion. The power output was more sensitive than the voltage output under shocks, and thus preventing the false signals. The simulation of power  using PMS indicated that PMMFC could accomplish more frequent data transmission than single-anode MFCs (PSMFC) and CC anode MFCs (CCMMFC), making the self-support wastewater monitor and data transmission possible. Compared with traditional MFC sensors, PMMFCs integrated with PMS exhibit the distinct advantages of tight paper-packed structure, short acclimation period, high power output, and high sensitivity to a wide range of shocks, posing a great potential as "disposable self-support shock sensor" for real time in situ monitoring of wastewater quality.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Attempts to harvest coalbed methane for  production are challenged by relatively low methane concentrations. In this study, we investigated whether nutrient and  amendment of a non-producing sub-bituminous coal well could transform the system to a methane source. We tracked cell counts, methane production,  concentration and geochemical parameters for 25 months in one amended and one unamended coal well in Australia. Additionally, the microbial community was analysed with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing at 17 and 25 months after amendment and complemented by metagenome sequencing at 25 months. We found that cell numbers increased rapidly from 3.0 × 10 cells ml to 9.9 × 10 in the first 7 months after amendment. However,  depletion with concomitant methane production started only after 12-19 months. The microbial community was dominated by complex organic compound degraders (Anaerolineaceae, Rhodocyclaceae and Geobacter spp.), acetoclastic methanogens (Methanothrix spp.) and fungi (Agaricomycetes). Even though the microbial community had the functional potential to convert coal to methane, we observed no indication that coal was actually converted within the time frame of the study. Our results suggest that even though nutrient and  amendment stimulated relevant microbial species, it is not a sustainable way to transform non-producing coal wells into bioenergy factories.© 2017 The Authors.

The microbial fuel cell (MFC) showed maximum power density of 3004 mW m(-2) after continuous feeding with artificial wastewater containing  substrate. Subsequent replacement of the  substrate with complex substrate of POME recorded maximum power density of 622 mW m(-2). Based on 16S rDNA analyses, relatively higher abundance of Deltaproteobacteria (88.5%) was detected in the MFCs fed with  artificial wastewater as compared to POME. Meanwhile, members of Gammaproteobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria codominated the microbial consortium of the MFC fed with POME with 21, 20 and 18.5% abundances, respectively.Enriched electrochemically active bacteria originated from POME demonstrated potential to generate bioenergy from both  and complex POME substrates. Further improvements including the development of MFC systems that are able to utilize both fermentative and nonfermentative substrates in POME are needed to maximize the bioenergy generation.A better understanding of microbial structure is critical for bioenergy generation from POME using MFC. Data obtained in this study improve our understanding of microbial community structure in conversion of POME to electricity.© 2011 The Authors.

To address this limitation, different EDs and electron acceptors (EAs) were combined to compare their CE performances, and to investigate whether the combination of ethanol and lactate could further enhance the MCFA production based on the complementary characteristics of ethanol and lactate. The results verified, for the first time, ethanol and lactate as the co-EDs formed a cooperative relationship to largely promote the conversion of substrates into MCFA. The co-EDs of ethanol and lactate stimulated the transformation of dispersive lactate-carbon flux from the competing acrylate pathway into n-heptylate. Additionally, the coexisting by-products (H and CO) from ethanol and lactate also contributed to the supererogatory MCFA generation. The key microbial taxa that distinguished the co-EDs from their single action were the preponderant species from class Negativicutes and family Ruminococcaceae. In addition, the co-EAs of , n-butyrate, and n-caproate also promoted MCFA generation. Low concentration of n-caproate could be directly elongated into n-caprylate, while n-caproate concentration exceeding the toxic limit was unsuitable as an EA. This research provided a guide for substrate selection and collocation for CE technology. Chinese liquor-making wastewater (CLMW) was subsequently used as a substrate for MCFA production since it contains abundant lactate, ethanol, and short-chain fatty acids. In this study, a MCFA selectivity of 80.34 ± 5.26%, a slightly higher selectivity which is in the range of previously reported ones, was obtained. This study paves a way for the sustainable development of Chinese liquor industry by recycling the high-output CLMW into MCFA.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Sludge can be hydrolysed and fermented, giving a mixture of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). Based on the composition of such a fermented stream, synthetic media were created and tested for VFA conversion in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Mainly  and propionate were preferred as electron donors in the mixed VFA system, which generated a power density of 49+/-1 mW L(NAC)(-1). The other VFAs (butyrates/valerates/caproic acid) were also removed, albeit at lower rates. In single VFA tests, each VFA could be removed, but particularly i-butyrate did not provide significant current generation. PCR-DGGE indicated that the microbial community structure was highly determined by the fed VFA, rather than by the initial inoculum. The communities were dominated by Proteobacteria such as Geobacter, Comamonas, Pseudomonas and Pelobacter species. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using fatty acids, as present in fermented sludge hydrolysates, for current generation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27648960>Role of Gut Microbiota and Short Chain Fatty Acids in Modulating   and Fat Partitioning in Youth.</a></h2><p>We aimed at determining the relationship of the gut microbiota and short chain fatty acids with obesity and fat partitioning and at testing potential differences in the ability of gut microbiota to ferment equal amounts of carbohydrates (CHO) between lean and obese youth.We analyzed the gut microbiota of 84 youth in whom body fat distribution was measured by fast-magnetic resonance imaging, de novo lipogenesis (DNL) quantitated using deuterated water, and the capability of gut flora to ferment CHO was assessed by C-fructose treatment in vitro.A significant association was found between the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, and the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria with body mass index, visceral and SC fat (all P < .05). Plasma , propionate, and butyrate were associated with body mass index and visceral and SC fat (all P < .05) and with hepatic DNL (P = .01, P = .09, P = .04, respectively). Moreover, the rate of CHO fermentation from the gut flora was higher in obese than in lean subjects (P = .018).These data demonstrate that obese youth show a different gut flora composition than lean and that short chain fatty acids are associated with body fat partitioning and DNL. Also, the gut microbiota of obese youth have a higher capability than the gut flora of lean to oxidize CHO.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27593449>Evaluation of seasonal changes of triterpenic acid contents in Viscum album from different host trees.</a></h2><p>Viscum album L. (Loranthaceae) is a semi-parasitic plant used in pharmacy and medicine mostly for its hypotensive and anticancer activity. The effects may be related to the presence of triterpenic acids, such as betulinic (BA) and oleanolic (OA) acids.In our investigations the content of triterpenic acids in V. album from different host trees depending on the season of  was determined.V. album herb was dried and extracted with ethyl  using ultrasound . The reversed phase HPLC-PDA method was used for the analysis of triterpenic acids. The structure of the target components was confirmed by mass spectrometry with an electrospray ionization source.Diversity in the content of both compounds was noted; however, OA was the dominant triterpenic acid and the amount thereof was ∼10 times higher than that of BA. The analysis of changes in the amount of triterpenic acids during the spring-winter period revealed the highest content of OA in summer (from 6.84 to 13.65 mg/g). In turn, in the other seasons of , the content was in the range of 4.41-9.83, 6.41-9.56 and 5.59-12.16 mg/g for spring, autumn and winter, respectively. In most cases, a similar tendency was observed for BA.In most cases, the highest amount of the investigated compounds was found in summer; thus, this period seems to be optimal for acquisition of plant material rich in triterpenic acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336029>Photothermal Conversion Material Derived from Used Cigarette Filters for Solar Steam Generation.</a></h2><p>Solar steam generation by photothermal materials has recently emerged as a new and feasible approach to effectively harvest solar  in a variety of applications. This work reports an efficient heat localization material based on the renewable cellulose  cigarette filters and a reduced graphene oxide coating (RGO-CF) as the light-to-heat conversion layer for solar steam generation. RGO-CF possessed an aligned structure with superhydrophilic nature, lower thermal conductivity (0.0733 Wm  K ), and broad light adsorption (≈100 %). These characteristics enable rapid water transportation and excellent light-to-heat conversion by the resulting RGO-CF with an  conversion efficiency of 94 % under stimulated solar illumination (1 kW m ), which demonstrates that RGO-CF is a promising photothermal conversion material for solar steam generation. Such strategy for preparation of photothermal materials not only reduces the fabrication cost but also provides a fundamental guidance for the practical application of renewable polymer resources from used cigarette filters.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were grown in the Sueoka culture medium, harvested with polyacrylic SAPs and re-suspended in the culture medium tris--potassium without sulfur (TAP-S) to generate hydrogen (H2 ) under anoxic conditions. The H2 production as an alternative fuel is relevant since this gas has high- recovery without involving carbon. Before microalgae harvesting, a number of range diameters (1-7 mm) for SAPs spherical particles were tested, and the initial rate (V0 ) and the maximal capacity (Qmax ) were determined for the Sueoka medium absorption. The SAP particles with the diameter range 2.0-2.5 mm performed the best and these were employed for the rest of the experiments. The Sueoka medium has a high salt content and the effect of the ionic strength was also studied for different medium concentrations (0-400%). The SAPs were reused in consecutive absorption/desorption cycles, maintaining their absorption capacity. Although the Sueoka medium reduces the SAPs absorption capacity to 40% compared with deionized water, the use of SAPs was very significant for the desulfurization process of C. reihardtii. The presence of C. reinhardtii at different concentrations does not affect the absorption capacity of the Sueoka culture medium by the SAPs. In order to reduce the time of the process, an increase of the SAPs concentration was tested, being 20 g of SAP per liter of medium, a condition to  the microalgae culture in 4 h. There were no evident cell ruptures during the harvesting process and the cells remained alive. Finally, the harvested biomass was re-suspended in TAP-S medium and kept under anaerobic conditions and illumination to produce H2 that was monitored by a PEM fuel cell. The use of SAPs for microalgae harvesting is a feasible non-invasive procedure to obtain high concentrations of functional biomass at low cost; it offers an attractive alternative due to its versatility and simplicity.© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10100656>Effects of implants on daily gains of steers wintered on dormant native tallgrass prairie, subsequent performance, and carcass characteristics.</a></h2><p>Fall-weaned crossbred steer calves (n = 300; 184 +/- 2.9 kg) received either no implant (Control) or were implanted with Synovex-C (SC = 10 mg estradiol benzoate + 100 mg progesterone), Synovex-S (SS = 20 mg estradiol benzoate + 200 mg progesterone), or Revalor-G (RG = 8 mg estradiol-17beta + 40 mg trenbolone ) to determine the effects of implants on weight gain during winter grazing on dormant tallgrass prairie, subsequent grazing and finishing performance, and carcass characteristics. Steers grazed two dormant tallgrass prairie pastures from October 16, 1996, until March 29, 1997 (164 d), and received 1.36 kg/d of a 25% CP supplement that supplied 100 mg of monensin/steer. Following winter grazing, all steers were implanted with Ralgro (36 mg zeranol) and grazed a common tallgrass prairie pasture until July 17 (110 d). After summer grazing, all steers were implanted with Revalor-S (24 mg estradiol-17beta + 120 mg trenbolone ), and winter implant treatment groups were equally allotted to four feedlot pens. Steers were harvested November 17, 1997, after a 123-d finishing period. Daily gains during the winter grazing phase averaged .28, .32, .32, or .35 kg/d, respectively, for Control, SC, SS, or RG steers and were greater (P < .01) for implanted steers than for Controls. Summer daily gains were similar (1.05 +/- .016 kg/d; P > or = .61) for all treatment groups. Feedlot daily gains were also similar (1.67 +/- .034 kg/d; P > or = .21), with implanted steers weighing 14 kg more than Control steers (P = .05) at , despite similar management during summer grazing and feedlot phases. Control steers tended (P = .06) to have lower yield grades. There were no differences (P = .99) in marbling between implanted and nonimplanted steers. Steers implanted during the wintering phase had increased skeletal and overall (P < .01) carcass maturities compared with nonimplanted steers, which resulted in more "B" and "C" maturity carcasses. Because carcass maturity score affects quality grade, the increased maturities of implanted steers resulted in a $9.04 decrease in carcass value/100 kg (P < .01) compared with Controls. The results of this study indicate that growth-promoting implants are efficacious for cattle wintered on dormant native range despite low daily gains. This increased weight is maintained through the summer grazing and feedlot phases; however, the benefit of the increased weight may be offset by decreased carcass quality grade and value due to increased carcass maturity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11799240>Electrode-reducing microorganisms that   from marine sediments.</a></h2><p> in the form of electricity can be harvested from marine sediments by placing a graphite electrode (the anode) in the anoxic zone and connecting it to a graphite cathode in the overlying aerobic water.

A Tris--Phosphate-Pluronic (TAPP) medium that undergoes a thermoreversible sol-gel transition is developed to efficiently culture and harvest microalgae without affecting the productivity as compared to that in traditional culture in a well-mixed suspension. After seeding microalgae in the TAPP medium in a solution phase at 15 °C, the temperature is increased by 7 °C to induce gelation. Within the gel, microalgae are observed to grow in large clusters rather than as isolated cells.

Here we apply DO-transient control to the production of Jembrana disease virus protein in complex Super Luria medium and compare performance against a high-limit pH-stat controller. For induction at medium cell density ( between 31 and 32.5 g dcw L) a total productivity of 0.27 g L h was achieved as compared to 0.24 g L h with the high-limit pH-stat. For induction at high cell density ( at 60 g dcw L), decreased productivity (0.12 g L h) was attributed to the effect of  accumulation on recombinant protein formation and a concomitant lowering of the critical growth rate. Our results suggest that complex media provides a difficult environment for the application of  threshold tracking DO-transient control because of difficulties in re-oxidizing , and apparent localized production of  below the production threshold (as detected by the DO-transient controller as SPOUR(crit)). Configuring the DO-transient controller to avoid aggressive threshold probing is suggested as a means to improve performance and reduce  accumulation in complex media.Copyright 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26020340> and glucose incorporation into subcutaneous, intramuscular, and visceral fat of finishing steers.</a></h2><p>The objectives of this study were to assess the effects of early grain feeding on  and glucose turnover rates and  and glucose preference for palmitate synthesis by subcutaneous fat (SCF), intramuscular fat (IMF), and visceral fat (VF) in finishing steers. Sixteen Angus × Simmental steers were used in the study; 8 were early weaned (EW) and fed a high-grain diet immediately after weaning for 100 or 148 d, and 8 remained with their dams on pasture until weaning at 202 ± 5 or 253 ± 5 d of age. Normal weaned (NW) and EW animals were combined and grazed to 374 ± 5 or 393 ± 5 d of age, when they were placed on a corn silage-based finishing ration until they achieved a SCF thickness of 1.0 to 1.2 cm (494 ± 17 d of age for EW steers and 502 ± 12 d of age for NW steers). Immediately before , steers were continuously infused for 12 h with [2H3]  (1.63 mmol/min; n = 8) or [U-13C6] glucose (0.07 mmol/min; n = 8). Blood samples were collected before initiation of infusions and at the end of the infusion from 8 animals or at 1-h intervals for the first 11 h and at 15-min intervals for the last hour of infusion for the other 8 animals. Adipose tissue samples from SCF, IMF, and VF depots were collected at , and lipids were extracted. Plasma enrichments of  and glucose and palmitate enrichment in each depot were used to calculate plasma turnover rates and fractional synthesis rates (FSR; % per h) of palmitate from each isotope. Early weaned steers had greater marbling scores compared to NW steers ( P< 0.05). Plasma turnover rates and FSR for EW and NW steers were similar except for SCF, where a greater FSR from  was observed for EW steers. It is possible the greater FSR for SCF was due to harvesting the animals at a slightly more advanced stage of conditioning as evidenced by the trend for greater 12th rib fat (P = 0.07). Plasma  turnover and palmitate FSR from  were much greater (P < 0.05) than the corresponding rates from glucose, supporting the primary role of  as an  source and the primary substrate for lipid synthesis across fat depots.

A deeper understanding of the fermentation process involving metabolic and biochemical principles is very necessary to overcome these difficulties. In this work a novel metabolic  based model is presented that accurately predicts for the first time the experimentally observed changes in product spectrum with pH. The model predicts the observed shift towards formate production at high pH, accompanied with ethanol and  production.  (accompanied with a more reduced product) and butyrate are predicted main products at low pH. The production of propionate between pH 6 and 8 is also predicted. These results are mechanistically explained for the first time considering the impact that variable proton motive potential and active transport  costs have in terms of   over different products yielding. The model results, in line with numerous reported experiments, validate the mechanistic and bioenergetics hypotheses that fermentative mixed cultures products yielding appears to be controlled by the principle of maximum   and the necessity of balancing the redox equivalents in absence of external electron acceptors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17208022>Zoonotic bacterial populations, gut fermentation characteristics and methane production in feedlot steers during oral nitroethane treatment and after the feeding of an experimental chlorate product.</a></h2><p>Nitroethane inhibits the growth of certain zoonotic pathogens such as Campylobacter and Salmonella spp., foodborne pathogens estimated to cause millions of human infections each year, and enhances the Salmonella- and Escherichia coli-killing effect of an experimental chlorate product being developed as a feed additive to kill these bacteria immediately pre-. Limited studies have shown that nitroethane inhibits ruminal methane production, which represents a loss of 2-12% of the host's gross  intake and contributes to global warming and destruction of the ozone layer. The present study was conducted to assess the effects of 14-day oral nitroethane administration, 0 (0X), 80 (1X) or 160 (2X)mg nitroethane/kg body weight per day on ruminal and fecal E. coli and Campylobacter, ruminal and fecal methane-producing and nitroethane-reducing activity, whole animal methane emissions, and ruminal and fecal fermentation balance in Holstein steers (n=6 per treatment) averaging 403+/-26 (SD) kg BW. An experimental chlorate product was fed the day following the last nitroethane administration to determine effects on E. coli and Campylobacter.

Administration of nitroethane increased (P<0.001) nitroethane-reducing activity in ruminal, but not fecal samples. Day of study affected ruminal (P<0.0001) but not fecal (P>0.05) methane-producing and nitroethane-reducing activities (P<0.01); treatment by day interactions were not observed (P>0.05). Ruminal accumulations of  decreased (P<0.05) in 2X-treated steers when compared with 0X- and 1X-treated steers, but no effect (P>0.05) of nitroethane was observed on propionate, butyrate or the  to propionate ratio. Whole animal methane emissions, expressed as L/day or as a proportion of gross  intake (%GEI), were unaffected by nitroethane treatment (P>0.05), and were not correlated (P>0.05) with ruminal methane-producing activity. These results demonstrate that oral nitroethane administration reduces ruminal methane-producing activity but suggest that a microbial adaptation, likely due to an in situ enrichment of ruminal nitroethane-reducing bacteria, may cause depletion of nitroethane, at least at the 1X administration dose, to concentrations too low to be effective. Further research is warranted to determine if the optimization of dosage of nitroethane or related nitrocompouds can maintain the enteropathogen control and anti-methanogen effect in fed steers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20053591>Explore various co-substrates for simultaneous electricity generation and Congo red degradation in air-cathode single-chamber microbial fuel cell.</a></h2><p>Microbial fuel cell (MFC) holds a great promise to  electricity directly from a wide range of ready degradable organic matters and enhance degradation of some recalcitrant contaminants. Glucose,  sodium and ethanol were separately examined as co-substrates for simultaneous bioelectricity generation and Congo red degradation in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) air-cathode single-chamber MFC. The batch test results showed that more than 98% decolorization at the dye concentration of 300 mg/L were achieved within 36 h for all tested co-substrates during electricity generation. The decolorization rate was different with the co-substrates used. The fastest decolorization rate was achieved with glucose followed by ethanol and sodium . Accumulated intermediates were observed during Congo red degradation which was demonstrated by UV-Visible spectra and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Electricity generation was sustained and not significantly affected by the Congo red degradation. Glucose,  sodium and ethanol produced maximum power densities of 103 mW/m(2), 85.9 mW/m(2) and 63.2 mW/m(2), respectively, and the maximum voltage output decreased by only 7% to 15%. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of using various co-substrates for simultaneous decolorization of Congo red and bioelectricity generation in the MFC and showed that glucose was the preferred co-substrate.Copyright (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Here, the easy-to- cyanobacterium (Chlorogloea fritschii TISTR 8527), from which the biomass instantaneously settled to the bottom of liquid culture, was utilized to produce poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) using a two-stage cultivation strategy. The cells were first pre-grown under normal photoautotrophy to increase their biomass and then recultivated under a heterotrophic condition with a single organic substrate to produce the product. Through optimization of this two-stage cultivation, the mass conversion efficiency of  substrate to PHB was obtained at 51 ± 7% (w/w), the comparable level to the theoretical biochemical conversion efficiency of  to PHB. This two-stage cultivation that efficiently converted the substrate to the product, concurrent with a reduced culture biomass, may be applicable for the production of other biopolymers by cyanobacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24678972>Assessment of metabolic flux distribution in the thermophilic hydrogen producer Caloramator celer as affected by external pH and hydrogen partial pressure.</a></h2><p>Caloramator celer is a strict anaerobic, alkalitolerant, thermophilic bacterium capable of converting glucose to hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide, , ethanol and formate by a mixed acid fermentation. Depending on the growth conditions C. celer can produce H2 at high yields. For a biotechnological exploitation of this bacterium for H2 production it is crucial to understand the factors that regulate carbon and electron fluxes and therefore the final distribution of metabolites to channel the metabolic flux towards the desired product.Combining experimental results from batch fermentations with genome analysis, reconstruction of central carbon metabolism and metabolic flux analysis (MFA), this study shed light on glucose catabolism of the thermophilic alkalitolerant bacterium C. celer. Two innate factors pertaining to culture conditions have been identified to significantly affect the metabolic flux distribution: culture pH and partial pressures of H2 (PH2). Overall, at alkaline to neutral pH the rate of biomass synthesis was maximized, whereas at acidic pH the lower growth rate and the less efficient biomass formation are accompanied with more efficient  recovery from the substrate indicating high cell maintenance possibly to sustain intracellular pH homeostasis. Higher H2 yields were associated with fermentation at acidic pH as a consequence of the lower synthesis of other reduced by-products such as formate and ethanol. In contrast, PH2 did not affect the growth of C. celer on glucose. At high PH2 the cellular redox state was balanced by rerouting the flow of carbon and electrons to ethanol and formate production allowing unaltered glycolytic flux and growth rate, but resulting in a decreased H2 synthesis.C. celer possesses a flexible fermentative metabolism that allows redistribution of fluxes at key metabolic nodes to simultaneously control redox state and efficiently   from substrate even under unfavorable conditions (i.e. low pH and high PH2). With the H2 production in mind, acidic pH and low PH2 should be preferred for a high yield-oriented process, while a high productivity-oriented process can be achieved at alkaline pH and high PH2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22075166>The influence of the fungal pathogen Mycocentrospora acerina on the proteome and polyacetylenes and 6-methoxymellein in organic and conventionally cultivated carrots (Daucus carota) during post  storage.</a></h2><p>Many carrots are discarded during post  cold storage due to development of fungal infections, caused by, e.g., Mycocentrospora acerina (liquorice rot). We compared the susceptibility of carrots grown under conventional and organic agricultural practices. In one year, organically cultivated carrots showed 3× to 7× more symptoms than conventionally cultivated, when studying naturally occurring disease at 4 and 6 months, respectively. On the other hand, we have developed a bioassay for infection studies of M. acerina on carrots and observed that organic roots were more susceptible after one month of storage than conventional ones, but no differences were apparent after four or six months storage. Levels of polyacetylenes (falcarinol, falcarindiol and falcarindiol-3-) did not change, whereas the isocoumarin phytoalexin (6-methoxymellein) accumulated in infected tissue as well as in healthy tissue opposite the infection. The proteomes of carrot and M. acerina were characterized, the intensity of 33 plant protein spots was significantly changed in infected roots including up regulation of defence and stress response proteins but also a decrease of proteins involved in  metabolism. This combined metabolic and proteomic study indicates that roots respond to fungal infection through altered metabolism: simultaneous induction of 6-methoxymellein and synthesis of defence related proteins.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
